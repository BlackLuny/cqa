I asked everyone around if that is what I really sounded like. they said yes.   that made me feel even worse!  The voice you hear when you are talking is so different because you hear it inside your head.   If you plug your ears while you say something it sounds even more different. but when you listen to a recording you only hear it with your ears.  you will get over it.  just remember, everyone else is used to hearing the voice you heard on the recoding.  it is your normal voice.  and there is nothing wrong with it.|`|AA10558731	Shhh.

One plus is that you can work as a nurse (after testing and licensing) after a year or two of grad school. It is an extremely rewarding career for those who love children, and have an interest in medicine.

smV6u3aeaa	The words "already" and "earlier" imply that the action took place in the past and is completed; therefore, the past tense works best with them. <br>  <br>  I could see the past perfect working because it indicates an action that took place in the past at an unidentified time. For example,  someone saying "I've already had a headache"  works in very specific circumstances. The person had a headache in the morning, it went away, and he or she gets another later, and complains, "I've already had a headache."<br>  <br>  Generally use the past tense with already and earlier. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps!|`|AA10152422	Just take out the have.|`|HbZ9assfaa	if u eat u will b no more hungry and ur headache   will vanish
1ffef2a150b04d01f1c8b188026bbd15aa	Sports are very important. Some people play sports for money and fame, but I think the true meaning is to have fun. Children join teams and make friends, and isn't that just a great thing, to know that you have those friends to trust and to grow up with. You can also enjoy sports because you know that you are getting exercise and it feels amazing to have muscles, doesn't it? Exercise is key to a healthy life style and I think more people should realize that, even though it kills to go outside and sweat, it will trully pay off in the long run, so if you just take the chance, you will be proud of your work.

The Prince of Verona intervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be punishable by death. Later, Count Paris talks to Lord Capulet about marrying his daughter, but Capulet is wary of the request because Juliet is still only thirteen. Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years and invites him to attend a planned Capulet ball. Lady Capulet and Juliet's nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris' courtship. After the brawl, Benvolio talks with his cousin Romeo, Lord Montague's son, about Romeo's recent depression. Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited love for a girl named Rosaline, one of Lord Capulet's nieces. Persuaded by Benvolio and Mercutio, Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline. However, Romeo instead meets and falls in love with Juliet. After the ball, in what is now called the "balcony scene", Romeo sneaks into the Capulet courtyard and overhears Juliet on her balcony vowing her love to him in spite of her family's hatred of the Montagues. Romeo makes himself known to her and they agree to be married.<br>  <br>  With the help of Friar Laurence, who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children's union, they are married secretly the next day. Juliet's cousin Tybalt, offended that Romeo had sneaked into the Capulet ball, challenges him to a duel. Romeo, now considering Tybalt his kinsman, refuses to fight him. Mercutio is incensed by Tybalt's insolence, as well as Romeo's "vile submission",[3] and accepts the duel on Romeo's behalf. Mercutio is fatally wounded and Romeo, angered by his friend's death, pursues and slays Tybalt. The Prince exiles Romeo from Verona for the killing. He also adds that if Romeo returns, "that hour is his last". Lord Capulet, misinterpreting Juliet's grief, agrees to marry her to Count Paris and threatens to disown her when she refuses to become Paris's "joyful bride". When she then pleads for the marriage to be delayed, her mother rejects her. Romeo secretly spends the night in Juliet's chamber, where they consummate their marriage.<br>  <br>  Juliet visits Friar Laurence for help, and he offers her a drug that will put her into a death-like coma for "two and forty hours".[4] The Friar promises to send a messenger to inform Romeo of the plan, so that he can rejoin her when she awakens. On the night before the wedding, she takes the drug and, when discovered apparently dead, she is laid in the family crypt.<br>  <br>  The messenger, however, does not reach Romeo and, instead, he learns of Juliet's apparent death from his servant Balthasar. Grief-stricken, Romeo buys poison from an apothecary and goes to the Capulet crypt. He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Believing Romeo to be a vandal Paris confronts him and, in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris. Still believing Juliet to be dead, he drinks the poison. Juliet then awakens and, finding Romeo dead, stabs herself with his dagger. The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find all three dead. Friar Laurence recounts the story of the two "star-cross'd lovers". The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud. The play ends with the Prince's elegy for the lovers: "For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."[5]<br>  <br>  Romeo and Juliet borrows from a tradition of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity. One of these is Pyramus and Thisbe, from Ovid's Metamorphoses, which contains parallels to Shakespeare's story: the lovers' parents despise each other, and Pyramus falsely believes his lover Thisbe is dead.[6] The Ephesiaca of Xenophon of Ephesus, written in the 3rd century, also contains several similarities to the play, including the separation of the lovers, and a potion which induces a deathlike sleep.[7]<br>  <br>  The earliest known version of the Romeo and Juliet tale is the story of Mariotto and Gianozza by Masuccio Salernitano, in the 33rd novel of his Il Novellino published in 1476.[8] Salernitano sets the story in Siena and insists its events took place in his own lifetime. His version of the story includes the secret marriage, the colluding friar, the fray where a prominent citizen is killed, Mariotto's exile, Gianozza's forced marriage, the potion plot, and the crucial message that goes astray. In this version, Mariotto is caught and beheaded and Gianozza dies of grief.[9]<br>  <br>  Luigi da Porto adapted the story as Giulietta e Romeo and included it in his Historia novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti published in 1530.[10] Da Porto drew on Pyramus and Thisbe and Boccacio's Decameron. He gave it much of its modern form, including the names of the lovers, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in Verona.[8] He also introduces characters corresponding to Shakespeare's Mercutio, Tybalt, and Paris. Da Porto presents his tale as historically true and claims it took place in|`|8SRB6gVDaa	Act 2, Scene 5<br>  <br>  SCENE V.

Zqae8Tk6aa	"Satyameva Jayate" (satyameva jayate ??????? ????) (Sanskrit: "Truth Alone Triumphs") is the national motto of India[1]. It is inscribed in Devanagari script at the base of the national emblem, which is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Asoka at Sarnath, near Varanasi in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The origin of the motto is a well-known mantra 3.1.6 from the mundaka Upanishad [1]. Full mantra as follows.<br>  <br>      satyameva jayate nān?ta?<br>      satyena panthā vitato devayāna? |<br>      yenā kramanty??ayo hyāptakāmā<br>      yatra tat satyasya parama? nidhānam ||[2]<br>  <br>  Meaning:<br>  <br>      Truth alone triumphs; not falsehood.<br>      Through truth the divine path is spread out by which<br>      the sages whose desires have been completely fulfilled,<br>      reach where that supreme treasure of Truth resides.[3]<br>  <br>  M. A. Mehendale in his "Satyam Eva Jayate Nān?tam"[4] however disputes this interpretation and provides alternative interpretation based on extensive analysis of the Upanishads and the use of Sanskrit. Mehendale notes:<br>  <br>      In the above interpretation satyam and anrtam are taken to be the subjects, but this does not seem to be correct. Both satyam and anrtam have to be regarded as the objects, and a rsi is to be understood as the subject.

Truth alone wins would mean that only the success of Truth should be considered as success and not the seeming successes of evil.. winning an episode they (evil motives) had lost the essence of merit.. <br>  <br>  For, you do not keep the sandals in a jewel box not the jewels in a shoe case..! By placing the superior thing in a low place, you don't make it any less worthy..! on the contrary you make yourself a laughing stock in the eyes of the sane peers!<br>  <br>  Now people win elections by false promises, (mis)using money and other rigging tactics.. what it is worth for the winner or the people.. The winner suffers the thorn of guilt ever in his inner mind.. the wealth and power he enjoys will not assuage the nagging discomfort in the inner self..!<br>  <br>  The fall of a giant leader like Kamaraj in a election (by playing on the emotions of people on a language issue by crafty political opponents) did not make him any smaller in the eyes of the people who always held the leader in the highest esteem..That is the real success.. The transitory winner never out weighed the leader whom he "defeated" though he did enjoy privileges..<br>  <br>  Parties without a majority given by the electorate align with adversaries in collusions of convenience and form govts for enjoying power.. they do not give any ethical governance but indulge in self praise and juglaries of sorts to remain in power.. Is this the victory of Truth..? <br>  <br>  What is wrong in the argument of Poondi that (one of) you gave him thumbs down..? He refuses to go by your dreamy articulation of meanings.. I agree with him and gave him a thumbs up, as only Truth wins becos the victory of anything other than Truth are not real wins but illusions of victory! <br>  <br>  Jai ho Rajya Sri Bharath Mataram!|`|56f857adccfe97c5b5197529fd3759b6aa	The literal meaning would be difficult to digest. The Govt of India is having this slogan in the national emblem, but the Govts are known for uttering all falsehoods to the people, to other govts, to the courts (in cases relating to govt., for which expert liars - sorry, advocates are engaged..).. even to their own party men! <br>  <br>  Had truth and truthful people won challenges to any significant measure, there would have been no liars in the world.. But the fact is the best of men of character are more remembered than followed.. for they had not accomplished much for themselves, their families or their organisations.. The examples they set were too difficult to follow by the best of their followers too..!<br>  <br>  Sathya or Truth is an ideal that has to be protected for its own sake.. just you will protect your loved ones for their own sake.. they deserve to be protected and we have a duty to protect them.. In the case of Truth, it is divine, difficult to adhere at all times, particularly under challenging times, yet if they are adhered at all cost.. you earn a rare merit, nay immortal merit.. that is it..<br>  <br>  So I would rather like to say that success of Truth is alone success.. the success of villiany is not worthy of adoration with the appellation success rather it is betrayal of success - putting it on an unworthy stuff..<br>  <br>  There is more spiritual significance to it than mundane.. Satyam that is God alone wins.. not the relative truths we dabble with in a transitory world.. the truths appearing as less true from another perspective because of the mix up of values.. the difference of standards of measurements.. etc!|`|hl5cZxO2aa	Truth always wins.<br>  However not applicable all times.

xnq7Nrgkaa	Okay, well lets just start off by answering your first question, which is somewhat easy to answer. Yes, it is extremely difficult to get into a university to study medicine, especially at a university which is half good (only good universities are usually allowed their own medical colleges).<br>  <br>  Now, your subject choices are key! You must have at least chemistry and a maths subject, and then biology as well would be helpful (I see your taking biology and chemistry). Next would be your grades. You will at least need 3 full A2's at around AAB but usually they will normally only accept AAA. Medicine is a very difficult subject to do, and so high grades are a must.<br>  <br>  Next would be your extra curricular activities and your personality. Are you someone who could benefit from studying medicine? Or are you someone who is somewhat squeamish? Also, do you have a passion for science and research? As far as extra curricular activities go, anything science or maths related will always be a plus. Duke of Edinburgh Award is something good to hold. <br>  <br>  Now, what happens if you have all this and still not get in? Well don't fret, chances are there were just so many applicants for a single place, just try again the year after. But what happens if you don’t have all this? Well there are some universities which offer Medicine with a foundation year (usually a 6 year programm). The University of Southampton is one that I know of, and The University of East Anglia is another. These are incredibly difficult to win places for however, and mostly only open to mature students. There’s also the option of doing a graduate degree in medicine. This is where you follow a degree in a science related subject (other than medicine), and then do medicine later on once you graduate (you usually must have at least a 2.1 or preferably a first class honours in a science related subject). Both Uni Southampton and UEA both have this course available.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, there are huge possibilities and routes in science you can follow. You may find Dentistry or Vet Sciences easier to get into, and if not there are plenty of other science degrees and careers out there.<br>  <br>  Oh and yes, any work experience you can do at a doctors surgery or even a hospital will help tremendously, however you will find it difficult to get a job or work experience at your age. Normally people who have had work experience along side doctors then go into medical school are mature students (at least 21 years of age or older). <br>  <br>  Hope this info helps!|`|L3TnN3SNaa	impossible|`|Zzu9lGjJaa	Quite hard i'd say

YbmXMxSMaa	In physics, and more specifically kinematics, acceleration is the change in velocity over time.[1] Because velocity is a vector, it can change in two ways: a change in magnitude and/or a change in direction. In one dimension, acceleration is the rate at which something speeds up or slows down. However, as a vector quantity, acceleration is also the rate at which direction changes.[2][3] Acceleration has the dimensions L T?2. In SI units, acceleration is measured in metres per second squared (m/s2).<br>  <br>  In common speech, the term acceleration commonly is used for an increase in speed (the magnitude of velocity); a decrease in speed is called deceleration. In physics, a change in the direction of velocity also is an acceleration: for motion on a planar surface, the change in direction of velocity results in centripetal acceleration; whereas the rate of change of speed is a tangential acceleration.<br>  <br>  In classical mechanics, the acceleration of a body is proportional to the resultant (total) force acting on it (Newton's second law):<br>  <br>   <br>  where F is the resultant force acting on the body, m is the mass of the body, and a is its acceleration.|`|ITFxQsKWaa	Okay, <br>  <br>  The first idea of an object is position. This is obvious to all of us it is where something is. <br>  <br>  The next derivative of this, meaning the actual mathematical derivative so the slop of the position line, is velocity.<br>  <br>  Velocity is the actual speed of an object that we think of. So if your moving at 40 m/s your velocity is 40 m/s<br>  <br>  Acceleration is the derivative of velocity.<br>  <br>  What this means is how velocity is changing. So if you are accelerating at a rate of 10 m/s^2 and are currently at 40m/s if another second passes you will be moving at 50m/s then another second 60m/s and so on.<br>  <br>  Negative Acceleration would be slowing down/speeding up in the opposite direction. So 40m/s with a -10m/s^2 acceleration would go down after a second to 30m/s then another second to 20m/s.<br>  <br>  With this after a while the object would actually be going in reverse. So velocity would equal -40m/s after 8 seconds.<br>  <br>  Remember the direction of an object is relative. So you can be going "forward" in a negative direction. It's all how you choose to put a grid over the object in question.|`|2bHacnMBaa	Think of yourself walking.  You are walking at a certain speed.  Now think of yourself waking faster.  You are now walking at a faster speed.  Acceleration is the action of increasing speed.

u78BiL0Faa	This polynomial does not really reduce that well.<br>  <br>  The way you should factor is by looking for factors that terms have in common.  By terms I mean things like 12a^3 or 9a^2, anything connected by multiplication, exponentiation, parenthesis or division.<br>  <br>  In the example you have outlined the terms have nothing in common.  There is no proper factor of the coefficients other than one and the factors do not share any multiple of the variable in the equation.<br>  <br>  If you want to factor the equation it would look like this:<br>  <br>  We leave the three off to the side for the moment, forget about it, for now.<br>  <br>  12a^3 - 9a^2 + 4a<br>  <br>  Is what we have left.  Do these terms have anything in common?  They sure do, they all have an a in common.  So, we remove an a from each term and have:<br>  <br>  a(12a^2 - 9a + 4)<br>  <br>  At this point our polynomial has become irreducible once more.  We could continue to contract it and factor it arbitrarily but there would be no point in doing so.  In truth there is no real point to factoring it as far as we have already.  Our resulting equation is:<br>  <br>  a(12a^2 - 9a + 4) - 3|`|8a2c7511cfabb2e759e39cfc0b3a6c82aa	12a^3-9a^2+4a-3<br>  <br>  3a^2+1  4a-3

In fact they don't even like it for A Level<br>  2) Doing such rare GCSEs (I've never heard of this GCSE Forensic Sciences) might be a bit trying because it is hard to find a tutor, test centre etc.<br>  3) You may have to pay up to 30 pounds to do this exams like these out of school in your own time<br>  4) You don't need GCSE Forensic Sciences to do a degree on it. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd try and do well in Science and Maths.

68Qm2W8waa	well i am not in medical school yet but i am planning on going. i have done alot of research as well including talking to my doctor all about medical school. first off getting into medical school is really challenging and its highly competitive cause most people don't get in. you have to get a 4 year chemistry or biology degree before you apply to medical school. and you have to do very well those 4 years.<br>  for the first 2 years of medical school you learn almost everything you need to know medical wise, cause your first 4 years in regular college is just science stuff and than wehn you get to medical school you actually start to get into the human body and learn about diseases and ilnesses etc. you also get to do labwork. than your 3rd and 4th years you do stuff outside of medical school, it is required that you have to spend so much time in different possible working environments, you sorta get to learn under drs you mostly don't get to do alot of the actual work but you go and take what you know to diffferent departments and instead of looking at a list of symptoms and saying whats wrong you have to go and look for it in people! you will have to spend time overseeing surgeries, you'll have to do family medicine which is like a regular drs office, in th ER, psychiatrics, geriatrics(old people), obsteriks and gynacology which is child birthing and the people who you go to about stds and things like that, i think you also do rounds in patheology wich are people who look at samples of peoples cells and determines if they have cancer or not, and radiology which i blieve are the x-ray people. andthan i no more into your 4th year after you did all these rounds you start getting an idea of what type of doctor youd want to be and you take some classes that are geared more towards what you want. than after your fourth year of medical school (8 years total of college) you ahve to do residency.<br>  wich is like interning but for years at a time.<br>  depending on what type of doctor you want to be a nuerologist an oncologist a family doctor you do so many years of residency its a minimal of 3 years you probablly will do more than that depending on what you specialize in. but you are more responsible for your actions in residency than you were just making rounds in general departments, you work under other doctrs but you get a little bit more freedom to make some calls of your own, i am under the impression you are paid to do this but not as much as a regular fully trained dr. and when your residency is complete you can get a real jobor the place you do your residency at might ask you to work for them. than you will start getting paid the regular salaries that place offers.<br>  <br>  although i've never been to medical school i know that it is really challenging you have to work really hard and be good at what your doing because if your going to be a doctor any mistake you make can cost somebody their life! also remember when you get out of school you'll have to get mal practice insurance wich is a type of insurance drs have to get, because along the line your going to come across people unhappy with how you took care of them or somebody else and sue you for your mistakes. well i hope i helped! i would suggest you call your doctor and ask if they would be willing to sit down and discuss with you about medical school and their experiences. thats what i did its nice to get a first hand in person account of it.|`|T33Za7jiaa	It's very good!<br>  My GF studied there for 3 years and is now doing very well for her self.

VSn32nk7aa	The Bible: The Book of Baruch, Bar 3,16-19.

nQWJuzwAaa	It's very informational & I like it. There are a few grammatical & spelling errors I'll point out though...And on top of that, some rephrasing would make your sentences more distinct. <br>  <br>  -Finally, there has been laws and regulations enacted in certain countries where animal abuse is known to exist."<br>  <br>  That should be "Finally there HAVE.."<br>  Because you are talking about a past tense. Plus, it sounds a bit more accurate. <br>  Um, as for the rest, where I capitalized the word; it means you misspelled the word & I corrected it. And I rephrased it to make it sound better. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Everyday, animals are inhumanly used for malicious human purposes, which causes them to suffer greatly. They are cruelly executed. Some people find purposes in CRUELLY killing an animal for their selfish needs, such as food. Pet owners are also apart of the animal abuse CONCERN, even besides the fact they love their pets. Finally, there has been laws and regulations enacted in certain countries where animal abuse HAS [here you have to stay in the same tense as earlier in the sentence] known to exist. Many animal rights groups and individuals as well are against the widespread animal cruelty and are now finally becoming aware of the dreadful acts they have committed.<br>  ______________________________<br>  <br>  Okay, I did the first paragraph, but I'm running a little short on time, so I cannot complete the rest. But you know what you're talking about & it seems to have a smooth edge.<br>  <br>  And here's a star so more people can answer|`|XpIQDo0baa	I don't think it posted.FINE IT POSTED!  I would change your thesis to something like.. Many animal rights groups and individual activists are educating the public about animal cruelty.  Or something like that.. agh idk lol but take known out<br>  <br>  Groups of people around the world believe that animal cruelty is necessary and is an acceptable way for a human to release their anger.  For instance, when food is needed in an area, people believe it is ok to cruelly execute any animal.  In other countries people will beat an animal, and let it suffer for a period of time before they use it for food.  Executing an animal harshly for food isn’t uncommon either.  At times animals are stripped painfully of its fur while it’s still alive.  Animals that are killed to satisfy materialistic needs will go to waste when there is low demand for the product.  It definitely seems cruel and unfair to abuse these animals.  No animal should have to suffer at the hands of someone so cruel.<br>  <br>  Pets are taken in by loving owners who say they will care for them, but that isn’t always the case.  Some owners that take in animals don’t realize what they have gotten themselves into.  Pet owners may easily become frustrated and some often feel the need to take their anger out on their pet.  The pet is usually physically wounded.  Kicking, hitting,……….whateva

Including the dropping of the U, from Colour and Harbour, and Labour etc.<br>  also, the z in ize, as opposed to ise, as a former Brit, even after twenty five years in the U.S. I still make errors, lol. Using the British English, rather than American. Same with many other words, like lorry for a truck, or bonnet and boot, for Hood and trunk. and so on.<br>  But it makes life interesting.|`|4sUqTjc8aa	The word theater can refer to a theater building, the art of theater, or even a home theater system.<br>  <br>  The word theatre should always refer to the art form and only the art form.  A "home theatre system" is a travesty to the art of theatre.  Unfortunately, evolution caused largely by capitalism is slowly causing the word theatre to be drained of all its meaning.  This evolution could cause the death of the word theatre altogether.<br>  <br>  Live shows that performed on stages without screens remained “theaters” while the new form of entertainment, moving pictures, were shown on screens without a stage for live productions and were, therefore, called “theatres”. <br>  <br>  So, live art performances "theater"- the place where movies are shown,  "theatres".<br>  <br>  BUT the distinction between the two has faded along with history... that is by using one word or the other has its proper usage so the distinction is one of tradition only.<br>  <br>  Are we confused yet?

PfE6bg5iaa	Everyone's afraid of taking out student loans. It's hard when you're starting off debt free, but remember it's rare that a college student doesn't require loans! <br>  <br>  First, I don't recommend commuting that far. You never know where gas prices are going to go, and that's a lot of wear on tear on your car. Plus, that long a commute makes it very hard to stay focused and not skip class!<br>  <br>  I was looking into student loan repayment a few weeks ago since I'm graduating this year. I found this really good calculator:<br>  <a href="http://apps.collegeboard.com/fincalc/sla.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://apps.collegeboard.com/fincalc/sla...</a><br>  <br>  I would just look up the average salary for a computer science grad from your school (they usually have that info on the college website) and use that. This calculator finds what your monthly payment will be after you consolidate your loans. It then takes into account your expected salary and determines if the payment will be reasonable based on an average cost of living.  I think it's something like your monthly loan payment should be less than 20% of your monthly income. The calculator explains it all after you put the numbers in.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  Good luck!|`|AA10023710	That's pretty far to commute. <br>  <br>  Is it a decent school? If it is, then it may be worth it. Do an internship or co-op while you study, and also gain any of the "hot" certifications that fit the particular field of CS that you hope to enter, and you'll be good when you graduate. CS is in demand, even now, and if you have a co-op or internship behind you, that'll increase your ability to land a solid job. You should make enough when you graduate to make paying off those loans not so daunting. <br>  <br>  What I suggest you do is try living on campus for the first term. Then, in your second term, or as soon as the school allows it, apply to become a Resident Assistant (RA). Those are the students who live on your hall and run programs and etc. They may be called something else at your school. Many schools give RAs free room, in exchange for the work they do. This would have obvious advantages for you.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	you are smart to be asking the question. i think you need to find out how good the placement department is . what percentage of grads get a job? are you sure that this is a job that you will be happy with? can you find someone to stay with close to the school?|`|AA10139925	In this day and age, saving money should be the ultimate goal, so I would seriously consider doing the commute and saving the on campus costs if you have the other part covered by scholarships. Taking on massive amounts of debt and not getting a job right out of school could put you further behind.  You should be able to get a job in your field and be paid well, but the fact is who wants to start out owing right off the bat. The cost of loans probably outweighs the cost of the commute.  I can't imagine the drive being as expensive as paying back the loans and it sure is easier to have your living expenses covered by Mom and Dad.|`|w9vnL4Mzaa	Definitely take the loan. Computer science is an extremely high paying field of interest. Especially for women, because probably around 80% of programmers or more are men. Big employers, such as Microsoft, go out of their way to hire women. There are also many student loan plans within your college that you will be able to follow in order to pay them off. Some include more scholarships, some include internships. Also, look at computer organizations around you and ask if they offer internships. <br>  <br>  In the end you will only regret living at home because you will miss out on half of the college experience, and have to drive for 2.5 hours every day in rush hour traffic, which will end up costing a lot of time and money in the end, also.

L4rlu2BDaa	Students aren't entitled to any benfits other then those given to them through there university or through student grants and loans.|`|YBusbOd0aa	That sounds like a part time foundation degree, a foundation degree studied full time should take two years. It carries 240 credits so is the same as the first two years of a BA honours. <br>  <br>  I myself done a foundation degree for the first two years then joined a Bsc Honours degree in the third year and i would recommend that you spend the three years to get a honours degree rather then three years to do a foundation degree as a BA honours will be more useful when finding employment.<br>  <br>  If the foundation degree is part time (i.e three years as opposed to two) you will not be eligible to some of the benefits of full time students such as students loans, grants from your LEA. Other student offers such as bus passes may also only be available to part time students.

9MrCI1VZaa	What if you did each day centered around an author??  Like Dr. Seuss, Eric Carle, Maurice Sendak etc.  Then during that day you can read all books by that author, have a snack that has to do with him (like Teddy Grahams for "Brown Bear, Brown Bear", "Green Eggs and Ham", etc.  You can have the kids do a project for that author like painting an animal in finger paints to look like Eric Carle's caterpillar or making a Cat in the Hat hat.  Last, you can do an activity, like the game "Brown Bear" or playing hopscotch for "Hop on Pop".  There are also lots of short movies to go with most big children's authors.  This would make your days structured because you know that you want a snack, game, some books, a craft, movie for each one.  It also is centered around literacy and education instead of just "pajama day". Hope this works out for you!|`|85d880b4c510002b409163300b68601eaa	Try a day of puppets.

So I guess its what it is.|`|pemGyfnwaa	I don't think that has anything to do with happiness.|`|IEbAHp0gaa	I don't know about happiness, maybe they earn more but not happiness.|`|7Ci0aU01aa	Its about person. For example If I dont be able to get in good university it will mean that I'm not strong person so I need to get in good university. Also it is terrible for your future not to go to university. University will make you much happier you will meet there new people and you will have fun otherwise you will soon get bored and feel spirited down. so I advise you to go tu university:) GOOD LUCK

If you have a nurturing personality, if you are smart and communicate well, if you are organized and a self starter, you could be a wonderful teacher.  You will be able to support yourself and your family, but you will never be rich in the traditional sense.<br>  That said, the skill set that makes a good teacher translates well to other careers.  If teaching is calling you, then study to be a teacher.  In the meantime, do some tutoring or volunteer work with children and teens, and see if you enjoy the challenges of being with them.<br>  If you find that you don't enjoy working with kids, then you have time to switch your studies to something else.
gb9REJN4aa	You'll be okay. Good boarding schools offer an unusual amount of personal attention for a school, so your English will surely improve rapidly. And you won't be able to help meeting people and making friends, no matter how shy you are: the whole thing about this kind of school is that you are living with your fellow students and you see them all the time. Living with somebody around the clock is a great way to have to get to know them.<br>  <br>  About the athletics--well, you will have to play sport. There's just no way around it. But remember that EVERYBODY at an English boarding school has to play sport, and not everybody else likes it, either. Moreover, the English idea of a sportsman is not quite the same as that of other nations. Remember that your school will have big strong types, bookish nerdy types, arty types, people who want to spend their days playing video games, and also short shy people. All of them will have to play sport. So don't think that you're the only one who hates balls. But also think of it as an opportunity to enjoy playing sport, since you don't have to be good at it to fit in for once. Some people will love it and will have been playing since they were small, but others will be newcomers just as much as you, and you'll find that there's a place for you on the sports field.<br>  <br>  Finally, I would say, go to a boarding school that is not too far from your home in the UK. Especially early on, it can help a lot if your parents take you out for weekend visits every few weeks. You will be surprised how quickly you realize that you'd rather stay at school than go home!|`|g1cKb45faa	Bang up the Headmaster and they will make you the V.V.I.P.

xJoMSkI5aa	From Shmoop on Beowulf<br>  <br>  Written in Anglo-Saxon, or Old English, sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries, Beowulf is an epic poem that reflects the early medieval warrior culture of Europe. Although scholars still debate some of the particulars, essentially Beowulf is the oldest surviving significant piece of literature in English.
1ZuF9FdSaa	Don't get involved in ridiculing other people.  This is the worst habit of high schoolers and only reflects poor self-esteem.  If you can, avoid drama and observe the way people act and treat their fellow students.  If you see someone who behaves admirably, don't be afraid to approach them and let them know you like their style of behavior.  Observe the people around you and decide who exhibits behavior, style and values that you want to develop in yourself.  Those people might become your best friends!  If you are going to school with the same people you have for years, try and take some time to step out of your usual habits/group and see what you might be missing.  Sometimes people get into habits in high school that lead them into poor decision making in thier adult life.  This is the first part of where you are discovering and creating who you are, who you want to be.  Don't get stuck in a life you don't like.  If you don't like something, don't just complain, figure out how to change it!!  Find an adult like a parent, teacher or mentor that you can turn to that will help you find solutions.<br>  <br>  Try to get involved in things that spark your interest and don't be afraid to ask your teachers for help outside of class.  This means maybe joining a club or sports team, but don't take on too much with your schedule.  I know it might be tempting to cheerlead, play rugby, be on the school newpaper staff and debate team, but remember you need some time to spend with family, friends, on homework and also time for just doing "nothing" or being alone.  <br>  <br>  Apply yourself.  It's easy to skate by getting Bs and Cs in classes, but the harder you work and develop good homework habits and study habits the better off you will be in college and at a real job.  High school is really just practice for college.|`|AA10071310	I trust you mean 'definitely'.<br>  <br>  Don't try to be a smart-alec.<br>  Pay attention to the teachers.<br>  <br>  Don't let socia life get in a position of more imporrtance than academia.

Since 1981, the amount of time kids spend playing sports has decreased<br>  by 58 percent for six- to eight-year-olds, 19 percent for nine- to eleven-yearolds,<br>  43 percent for twelve- to fourteen-year-olds, and 28 percent for fifteento<br>  seventeen-year-olds [Changing Times of American Youth: 1981–2003, Institute<br>  for Social Research, University of Michigan, 2004]. Since 1980, the number<br>  of overweight children in the U.S. has tripled, according to a 2004 report<br>  by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) of the Department of Health and<br>  Human Services. Even since 2000, there’s been a significant increase: 17.1 percent<br>  of American kids between the ages of two and nineteen are now considered<br>  overweight [Journal of the American Medical Association, June 2004]. The<br>  number of children with diabetes has also increased dramatically, according<br>  to the American Diabetes Association. The CDC predicts that one in three<br>  children born in 2000 will become diabetic <br>  <br>  Most teachers do not take courses specifically on homework during teacher<br>  training. In fact, research shows that the great majority are unaware of the<br>  research on the problems with homework [Stephen Aloia, “Teacher Assessment<br>  of Homework,” Academic Exchange Quarterly (Fall 2003)]. That’s why, as<br>  Cooper told the authors of The Case Against Homework, when it comes to<br>  <br>  <br>  homework, “most teachers are winging it.”<br>  <br>  According to Professor Cooper, kids should be assigned no more than ten<br>  minutes per grade level per school night (Monday through Thursday only). In<br>  other words, this adds up to ten minutes in first grade, twenty minutes in second<br>  grade, and so on, up to a maximum of two hours per night in high school<br>  [Harris Cooper, The Battle Over Homework, second edition, page 26].<br>  c The National Education Association and National Parent Teacher Association<br>  recommend no more than ten to twenty minutes of homework per night in<br>  grades K–2, and thirty to sixty minutes per night in grades 3–6.

Ftkr9jqYaa	HOW TO WHISTLE WITH FOUR FINGERS:<br>  <br>  Procedure 1:  It is easier if you use two hands. Put your index and pointer fingers from each hand into your mouth forming a V with the index fingers touching. Roll the tip of your tongue up toward the roof of your mouth and place the tips of your fingers on the bottom of your tongue near the tip. Blow. Once this is mastered you might find it easier to learn with the thumb and index fingers of one hand.<br>  <br>  Procedure 2:  See the four finger approach above, using two from each hand. Make a V and place on tongue.  Now you need to adjust two things: First, the angle in your mouth, by pointing your finger at the roof of your mouth or the back of you throat; and second, the width of the V. Slowly make adjustments until you hear a sound. Then just keep at it until you get the ear splitting blast that you are after. As a side note, no one likes it when you are at an event, sports, music or other, and the guy behind them blasts out their eardrums with a shrill whistle. Have fun!<br>  <br>  Procedure 3:  Right hand in the "OK" position (index and thumb arced into a circle, tips lightly touching).  Next, fold your tongue into a "Z" shape (imagine a side view cutaway of your head): the top bar of the Z is the part leading back to your throat, the bottom bar of the Z is the tip nearest the front of your mouth.  Then insert the index/thumb circle into your mouth, into the middle of the Z. The joined finger tips will touch your tongue just about where most people I know with tongue piercings have their doohicky.  Curl the tip of your tongue up around your fingertips and open a tiny gap between your fingertips until you find the sweet whistling spot. It helps to experiment with long slow exhalations rather than trying to just blast one out at first.  If you have any appreciable fingernail length (>1/16" max), you will not be able to make a sound.<br>  <br>  Best Procedure:<br>  <br>  1. Stretch your upper and lower lips down (and up) over your teeth and pull them tight. Like you're doing an impression of a toothless old wo/man. "Get off my lawn!" should resemble a muppet talking as you can't make shapes with your lips fixed like that.<br>  <br>  2. Shape your tongue into a bowl shape--slightly curled up on the sides and also at the tip. Place it against your upper lip that is curled around to the back of your upper teeth. Just place it lightly there but make a complete seal all the way around. <br>  <br>  3. Close your mouth and blow a little bit. You should have a complete seal so no air comes out. Now open your mouth slightly and blow a bit. You still should get no air coming out because your tongue is sealed against your upper lip. Now, move just the tip of your tongue down to let a little air out. <br>  <br>  4. Play with this and follow your ears. While keeping this basic shape/seal, move your mouth more open/closed, smile/pucker, tongue tip more open/sealed. Practice! It may take more than just a few minutes of fiddling to get. Hopefully at some point your shhhhh should become more of a sssssss, gain some hollowness, and eventually a whistle.<br>  <br>  How to Whistle with 4 Fingers:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkDAlOAyJ84" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkDAlOAyJ...</a><br>  <br>  How to Whistle Using Your Fingers:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/221563" rel="nofollow">http://www.vimeo.com/221563</a>

That is the number of days required for public schoolers, as well (though they can have ten absences a year, which homeschoolers are not permitted).<br>  <br>  Yes, we have weekends off.<br>  <br>  If there is a snow day, we are out side playing in it.  Snow is so incredibly rare here!<br>  <br>  We have a break at Christmas time, and Easter.  Christmas usually coincides with the public schools, and Easter usually does NOT (so that we can enjoy the local parks, etc. without massive crowds).<br>  <br>  We get a summer break, as well.  In the past, we have taken three months and we have done a shorter break, which we all prefer.  Starting next year, we are going to "do school" four days a week instead of five, which will make our year longer but also give us more days off.  We will take breaks throughout the year.<br>  <br>  The answers to your question will vary from family to family, because that is one of the joys of homeschooling-making it fit you!  <br>  <br>  Also, for us homeschooling is not just something we do but a way of life-so, while we would take the "day off" for a snow day, we would probably find some educational content in that day.  The same goes for weekends-we went out to lunch today and on the way home, we stopped at a park unplanned because the weather was so nice.  We ended up going on a hike, finding some sharks teeth, and talking about ecosystems and such.  My children have been raised to see that life is a constant learning experience, and they see learning as fun, as all children should.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps answer your questions.|`|a8IRxC4raa	Our state mandates 180 days a year, but no one is looking over our shoulder.  Every day is a learning experience, so one could say that we do school 365 days a year.  We're just not doing it in a classroom.<br>  <br>  Generally, we don't do work on weekends, although my daughter learns many things every day.<br>  <br>  No such thing as being snowed out from being home.  :)<br>  <br>  We take vacations when we want to.  Usually, our vacations are taken when you are in school (less crowding, shorter lines).<br>  <br>  In the summer, my daughter concentrates on art classes and outdoor activities.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|tCsFxh5Aaa	Depends on where you live.  Some states have requirements of numbers of days that homeschoolers have to "be in school."  Others have a minimum number of hours of "school work" that they have to do.  Some states (and countries)--such as Florida-- have neither of these requirements for homeschoolers, so we can do as little or as much as seems appropriate to the parents and so that they can prove that they are making academic progress in accordance with their ability.<br>  <br>  Parents get to decide on the child's "school calendar."  It can be whatever works for the family.  Personally, we don't take the summer months off because it's too hot to be outside then and the kids start to get on each other's nerves if they don't have some lessons or something--but we take off more time for fun things (many of which are educational, too) during the rest of the year when the weather is balmy.  <br>  <br>  We take days off when we want to during the year.  For some holidays, we take off more days than the public schools would allow.  Sometimes, the kids will work on one day of the weekend, but they'll get a day off during the week sometimes, too.  If the kids are too stressed, or if mom is, they get a day off.  If they are too bored, they might get more lessons or chores.  It all evens out in the end.<br>  <br>  My children do lessons for fewer hours than public school children are in school.  They have a lot more free time.  If the schools have a day off for hurricanes, my kids usually have part of the time off from lessons, too, because they are helping prepare for the possible storm.  But they can do lessons while we sit cooped up inside, while the power's out due to the storm, as it is a good way to take their mind off of the storm.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	Every bit of this depends on your personal preferences and your local regulations concerning how many days kids have to be in school. As long as you meet your area's laws and regulations you can "do school" whenever you want. Personally, I never did school work on the weekends or over scheduled breaks like Christmas or the summer (though my break time often fell on different days that the official break time in my district). Since I was homeschooled, snow days never had any influence on the work I could do at home, though sometimes I did have to cancel music lessons, field trips, or visits with friends if the weather was bad enough. I did know a few homeschoolers who didn't take set summer breaks or anything like that, though.<br>  <br>  Once I started going to college my schedule changed a little. If I had to do college work over the weekend I would, but I still didn't do my other work. I took Christmas and spring breaks at the same time as the rest of the college students.|`|MIqdsUdnaa	Where I am, in Western Canada, you schedule it exactly as you please. Last week we had a Chinook, which is a warm wind from the mountains that pushes the temperature up for a few days.  It's much warmer and the snow gets all wet and sticky.  On Thursday, we totally skipped school and spent the day building the most amazing snow fort.  As a result, on Friday, we added some extra math and pushed the math test to Saturday.  Also, we tend to work on the school holidays and take them the week before or after.  It helps us to avoid the crowds.  We also take our vacations in October or February when most kids are in school.  It's really awesome to be at hotels, theme parks, museums, zoos etc. and not have to wait in huge line ups.  The hotels and flights are cheaper, too.|`|735KiHn2aa	That depends on where you live. The laws are different for each state. For example, where we live, there are no set guidelines for how many days the child must "school", nor are there any rules regarding the number of hours per day, or number of days per week. Some states are much more strict though and require a specific number of days, a specific curriculum, etc...|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Homeschooling can be done on holidays, snow days, teacher days or any days that are considered a day off for students.<br>  It applies to the 'unschooling' method and the virtual/charter schools.<br>  Virtual/charter schools go by the public school system and even though there might be a holiday or snow day, you can still do work but you don't have to.|`|6fVzzNhiaa	As the other responders pointed out, the amount of time parents must actively school their children depends on what regulations (if any) are in place where the parents & children live.  (Alaska has no restrictions; Rhode Island stipulates, "during all the days and hours that the public schools are in session")  Some places go by days, others by total number of hours per 'school year.'<br>  <br>  Otherwise, though, this type of thinking presents family schedules in terms of a school that must accommodate and manage the comings and goings of large numbers of people according to laws.<br>  <br>  Schools have schedules so that teachers and students, bus drivers and janitors, cafeteria ladies and librarians all show up at the same place at the same time.  Otherwise, schools would be even more chaotic than is usual in high school hallways when classes change.  ;><br>  <br>  Also, thinking that families "get" time off is a backwards way of thinking about people who aren't taking part in the public system.  Just because parents have children within the range of compulsory school attendance ages doesn't grant outside agencies the right to direct everyday life.  <br>  <br>  "Getting" time off (as I read it here) implies some outside group giving permission to moms, dads and kids to stop sitting in chairs and writing reams of lessons.  That sounds like the planet Camazotz in Madeleine l'Engle's book _A Wrinkle in Time_, where people were so controlled that the children simultaneously started jumping rope on the sidewalk, and ended all together.  The heroes of the story were glad to leave that planet.<br>  <br>  With homeschooling, as long as the legal requirements are met, it is irrelevant to people outside the family when education, recreation, or any other family event happens.  Just as the local school lunchroom schedule has nothing to do with when the family members eat meals, and the local school's sports calendar means nothing to people outside that system, so, too, the schools' times off just don't matter (except perhaps in Rhode Island  ;>  ).<br>  <br>  Still, our social networks are so heavily centered on the schedule of schools (even the military services schedule many reassignments during the summer when school is in recess) that it is sometimes difficult to think how people not tied to that schedule structure their time, and to think that they're abnormal if they don't follow the local school's schedule.<br>  <br>  School schedules are time management tools for very-large-group activities.  Homeschooling families have family schedules.  <br>  <br>  And yes, if you want a 'snow day' (although I'm not sure why roads being slippery outside would affect what you do in the house), you can sure do that.  :)|`|5EnshhrKaa	The best thing about homeschooling is you make the rules. You will have to keep paperwork, but you choose the hours and days you want to have school. <br>  <br>  My daughter learned better at night so we did hers at night and she did so much better (she started college at 16).  As long as you get the material covered you can change the school days and even teach on weekends if it works for you.<br>  <br>  You don't need to submit a calendar for approval, and if you want to teach them year round you can so that they can go to college eariler than if they were in public school.|`|ENbE1Hi2aa	It depends on where you live and what your state's requirements are and how you homeschool.  If you are enrolled in a virtual school they are public schools so you have to be on their schedule.  In other words, the virtual schools get the same holidays as the public schools, so you get them, too.  Independent homeschoolers can set their own schedule, and consider learning is a full time activity, so meeting 'attendance' requirements is not really an issue.  It's okay to learn on Saturday.|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	It depends really. You can set your own school calendar, or you can follow the school district's schedule. For me, I follow the school district's calendar.<br>  <br>  Yes, you get weekends off, and also Christmas, Easter break, and summer break.<br>  <br>  Well, it doesn't snow where I live, but I worked through a hurricane once.|`|HvkcWqAEaa	Yes, we get weekends of.<br>  We don't get snow days off. (at least not me)<br>  We get christmas and spring break and summer vacation.<br>  My home school days (if you will) are the same as public school, basically.<br>  It just depends.
Mxr6AIkiaa	It's not a matter of SPSS, and SPSS is not only for "survey data." But I think you can answer your own question if you think about it.

Assuming you work a 5-day week, that's 6 hours per day.  That's much too long to expect someone to hold it without any breaks.  What do they expect you to do?  Pee your pants?

yGOmMQP7aa	Weather or not your parents claim you on their taxes has nothing to do with you being dependent or independent on your fafsa application.  If nothing has changed since you did the last fafsa (like you got married) you are likely still considered "dependent" and still will be required to list your parents info on the fafsa.  <br>  No, there is no law that says your parents have to provide tax documents to anyone and no law that says they can't claim you as long as they meet the IRS guidelines for claiming you as a dependent.  <br>  <br>  You generally have to put your parents income info down on  your fafsa until you are 24, married, have kids, earn a bachelors degree or a couple of other things.|`|ep8TVHKBaa	It doesn't matter how taxes are filed, FAFSA still considers you a dependent when you are under 24 with a few exceptions.<br>  <br>  Do you fill out the FAFSA?

But Im not a big believer in god. But i dont think you should use the excuse of hating highschool to learn more about god. Freshman year is the hardest year, wait till your a sophmore then decide. Also, what makes you think that all the kids in a religious school will be high class? A christian school will be one geneder only in certain cases will it have both geneders. If it is both geneders you will still  have seprate classes than the boys. I think religion is a personal thing that shouldnt be enforced, so you will get tests on the bible and such. It wont be alot of fun, when I waited in highschool till the next year people grew up and I made more friends. <br>  Last thing, High school will be no diffrent than a private school.|`|a8IRxC4raa	There is one big difference between private schools and public schools: tuition.<br>  <br>  You are going to find that the kids at the Christian school are like kids anywhere.  So if that's why you want to change schools, save your Grandparents the money and learn to deal with people as they are.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|s4psKJrPaa	if your really tired of your public school, id say go for it! its a chance to get closer to God and get out of your school. my mom teaches at a christion school, she said like they have uniforms, but different colors,and the kids are smarter, and more disciplined. id go for it!<br>  <br>  mine please!! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227134850AAGDB7Z">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>
sjOelwhhaa	Most likely a Latinate word that sounds "educated" to people.  For example, "kiss" in native English gets the point across, but "osculate," derived from Latin, sounds more "learned."  BTW, in this case, "learned" is pronounce wth two syllables.

74935bb8e45f026d8f222b3b74cffd8faa	If she doesn't have a specific question, but just says "I don't understand anything," don't feel bad, she is just being lazy and hoping you'll have pity and/or blame it on yourself and do her work for her. By doing it in class, she's probably hoping that the other students will get behind her and you'll give everyone an extension or do the problem for them.<br>  <br>  Next time she says that, just say, "My office hours are... The tutoring center is open from... Anyone else have any questions?" Give the same response every time and she will hopefully stop. Don't make special accommodations for her, and don't let her ruin your day.<br>  <br>  You could also allot 10-15 minutes the class before homework is due to address any specific questions on the homework. That would encourage people to get started early and bring up anything that gives them trouble. Even then, don't let her get away with just saying "I don't get it"--probe her about where exactly she got stuck and if it doesn't sound like she even tried, tell her to spend more time on it before giving up. As it stands, she's just pushing your buttons and/or trying to get out of work.|`|AFXE4cmxaa	I think you should call her to your office and tell her that if she ever has questions, not to wait until last minute but to share them earlier. Don't tell her that she is disturbing the class because she might get a little offended. I'm pretty sure that you are not the only person that she annoys with her remarks. Im about to be a freshman in college and if I knew a person like her, I probably would complain because afterall, I am paying for the class.<br>  Talk to Her.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	yeah, i would ask her to meet you in your office for this conversation.  that way she'll at least know where it is!  and be firm.  don't answer any of her silly questions in the middle of your lecture.|`|fSkt7SgDaa	Tell her she's out of luck because she could have asked for help earlier.

After all, even if she is just being disruptive, you don't want to brush her off and it's possible someone else also need clarification but doesn't have the courage (or chance) to speak up. If she keeps pestering you, say something like, "We can definitely talk more about that, but right now I have a lot of things to cover and I'd like to get through them. Why don't you talk to me after class, come to my office hours, or send me an email?" If she continues, repeat that she should see you after class. You might also want to mention her behavior to the professor and see if he/she has any hints for dealing with the student or if you could set up a time for the three of you to meet and discuss the issue. You have to tread carefully here because on the one hand, a single student shouldn't be allowed to disrupt class regularly, but on the other hand if her questions are genuine you really don't want to ignore them.

AA11942204	"Speler att Werk"
leV3hrC2aa	It's pretty much on the same note as "don't be a follower" but on a softer level. Culture is really different all over the world, and yeah you do have a choice as to which culture 'works' for you.<br>  <br>  When people think culture, first thing that pops in their mind i think is food. Only because that is the easiest part of a culture to portray but it is just a very tiny part of what makes a culture, there are bigger things; norm, rituals, language, manner, well those are really vague so to be specific... like how europeans and asians view death differently, how people work during weekdays, what people do on spare times, what kind of mutual respect people have for each other for the old and the young...etc etc etc.<br>  <br>  I'm confident enough to say, I'm multi cultural within myself, I don't have a strict culture I stick to and I can see where each culture comes from but I still wouldn't be able to live in Jamaica, no offence to Jamaica, but from what I hear, their culture is too different.<br>  <br>  So off to what i know better, eastern europe, people are poor,(GDP wise if u wanna look at it that way) a lot of them are, but they're soo damn relaxed, part of the reason why i think girls there are so down to earth and chills, an average construction worker, gets up at 9, meets up at the site at 10, have a coffee, work for an hour and a half, take an hour lunch break, have some watermelon and get back to work, and finish off at 3 walk downtown, and sit down at a cafe and have some drinks to chill. People there generally(key word generally) are about living their life, not about chasing money or a car, and believe me, it's not a stereotype, i've seen it myself first hand. Well maybe its just that materialism didn't catch up there yet, but that was a culture shock for me. Eastern Europe is also not so multicultural, 99.9999% of people there are Europeans, they find foreigners cool tho<br>  <br>  Western Europe, i've only been to Amsterdam, prostitution is legal, and so is marijuana and shrooms, they on the paper, say it is not, but they don't do anything about it so it is basically legal. I don't know how to explain this one but if you talk to any locals, you will see something different... i didn't stay there for so long so can't pinpoint what...a bit more open minded? i duno... anyways they're somewhat multi cultural, there's chinese food and what not but they're not even close to being as multicultural as Canada. I also heard, this could be wrong, but people in France are more talkative and nice.<br>  <br>  In the US, if you go to their country side, people are driven to have a happy family, not a wealthy family. Their kids are sometimes even home schooled. They have a decent sized property, and live off what they make at the farm. As long as they got a loving family they don't really seem to care.<br>  <br>  I've only talked about the different general aspiration of the cultures, but there is so much more like i mentioned earlie, rituals, manner, norm, mutual respect for others, food, how to spend the holidays, what one would normally do on a spare time... etc<br>  <br>  culture is not something you can change... You can't expect to travel to China and hope they will all follow you and start building gingerbread houses with winnie the pooh outside and ****. It's up to you, but Mitch Albom's saying find your lifestyle within you, not within your society you're raised in and live in the culture that is the most compatible with how you are. You have to know yourself well enough, you have to be strong enough to be able to take a step outside your imaginary cozy boundary set by your friends and family.<br>  <br>  I'm not necessarily saying the North American culture is generally bad, it's up to you to tell me whether you think it's bad(doesn't work for you) or good(works for you). You will actually see a big culture difference within North America itself too, but just visiting tour sites wont teach you that, you'd have to live the local's life to find that out. So many people live their life not knowing what's out there, and by just conforming to what they were raised in because of friends and family. Some actually do, a really good friend of mine, born here, moved to Serbia because he saw the lifestyle there suits him better... You know there are cases of farm boys moving to cities, and city people moving to country side,<br>  remember that one girl last year that commited suicide around kipling and dixon? because her parents walked in on her and she wasn't supposed to be with any boys? I have a friend who's Afghani, he wasn't allowed to go to Prom, he snuck out... I guess he wasn't strong enough, because his older brother, always rebelled and I know he's really westernized, he didn't buy his traditional culture, he was, in a way, stronger than his little brother to go against the traditional value. Come to think of it, I think this is what this quote is all about, this kind of case. I first thought Albom's saying 'get the **** out there and see ****', go on an adventure when i first read it but maybe not... i dunno its up to u to decide<br>  <br>  I think culture difference is another reason why interracial marriage has a higher chance of failure. You do not learn about the opponent's culture that really affects how they handle everyday situation until the very end, you learn about each other, fall in love and get married, then you start to realize things perhaps..

AA12042448	If the completion part is supposed to be made into plurals, the second one would be "Who were talking to their friends?"

Dangling prepositions aren't pretty.<br>  <br>  If you use "who were talking to his friend," you have several people talking to one friend.

If he has good, experienced, inspirational or productive teachers, you need not be worried. If some of his classmates are bad, tell him or find out how to get away from them or deal with them. Tell him to keep his head high, and keep his confidence. Encourage him to focus on his studies and his personality as this is an important part of his life.

vbAu5SY3aa	When I went home last night I was met by a big Rottweiler at my front door. I don't know whose it was, but it stood guard over my front door and wouldn't let me in. When I tried going to the back of the house the dog took out after me and chased me down the street. Well, I dropped my books running to get to my neighbors house. Just as I made it up on the front porch, the dog almost caught me. My neighbor saw me coming and just got the door open in time.

Maybe if enough students complain the college will listen. Good luck Honey and whatever it takes, hang in there.|`|2bHacnMBaa	Suck it up and deal with it.  I had the same situation with an instructor at my community college a few years ago.  He was the only one that taught the classes that I needed so I was stuck.  I still passed every one of his classes, with lower grades mind you, but I did pass.  I've found that some teachers can understand that they have to "teach" us certain theories and applications and some teachers just don't care and there's nothing you can do about it.  As for dropping, you CAN drop.  Take the class another time after taking time to think about what you need to do to deal with her.  Yes, your graduation will be put back but is it worth it to graduate sooner with a lower GPA or graduate later with a higher GPA?|`|L3mgbyWVaa	Yes we've all had them teachers. It's annoying when you do, but it's life. You just have to work that bit harder.

w1BC4paiaa	Well. :)<br>  1. I like it because as superficial as this is, my weight is smaller even though my body shape is roughly the same as my tall friend's.<br>  2.

Or, I could buy my clothes from their departments forever. They're cheaper. <br>  4. We use less material for clothes, need less food, & have smaller lungs (using less air!), so we're totally not short. We're "environmentally compact". Going green without doing anything, woot.<br>  5.

I see you've asked this question a few times and received one nondescript web site URL (that means someone gave you a URL without explaining what to expect if you decide to try it - they just wanted the 2 points for answering and couldn't give a dam if your question was satisfied - common here on Yahoo Answers)<br>  <br>  As the phrase (verbal reasoning) implies, this is a test where you verbally reason in such a way to discover "how well you can think and reason with words and if you have the ability to find the right word at the right time". (taken from this URL: <a href="http://www.3smartcubes.com/pages/tests/verbal-reasoning-test/verbal-reasoning-test_instructions.asp)" rel="nofollow">http://www.3smartcubes.com/pages/tests/v...</a> Where there is a sample test that has 15 questions and allows you 5 minutes. I just took the test and was offered 15 multiple choice type questions that is very similar to intelligence tests - it has a lot to deal with knowing the right words. In order to get the results - you have to register and you get a basic rundown of your results. Mine say "During this test you answered questions which measured your 'word skills'. Based on how you scored, we could conclude that you are just average at verbal reasoning. This means that you would manage with some difficulty at communicating with people or in tasks involving writing. <br>  However, some simple steps can remedy this by substantially improving your verbal skills. Would you like to know how? Clicking on the button, it turns out that it cost $9.95 for a one month membership to get access to a detailed report and how to improve. WARNING!!!: This is most likely a generic reply given to anybody who takes the sample test to get them to sign up and pay the 9.95 subscription fee. I HAVE NO IDEA how reputable this site actually is. You must use your own judgement if you decide to check this out. I did give my yahoo email address and time will tell how much they will pester me to try and sign up through the email!<br>  <br>  There is also an article in the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia that could explain this better than I probably could: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_reasoning" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_reas...</a>

Whenever there was any conversation on race, I was the other side, maybe because I never felt the kind of repression[prejudice treatment] other black people are exposed to, I think I was called a ‘n*g*r’ once when I was in fifth grade" (AUTHOR'S LAST NAME, PG #)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope i helped!!!!

During your undergraduate education, you will need to complete courses that are required to apply to medical school. Beyond those courses, your major doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  For most medical schools, you will need at least one year of each of the following courses:<br>  <br>  General Biology <br>  General Chemistry with Laboratory <br>  Physics <br>  Organic Chemistry with Laboratory <br>  English <br>  Calculus <br>  <br>  Then you will have to take a standardized exam called the MCAT, which will test your knowledge of the the above courses.<br>  <br>  In order to be considered a competitive candidate for medical school, you will need to have a GPA of at least 3.5 and an MCAT score of at least 30, but the higher the better since there are no guarantees in getting into medical school.<br>  <br>  During medical school, you will take courses in the core curriculum with numerous exams during the 1st two years covering different areas of basic science, pharmacology, physiology, and anatomy. You will also have to take two more big standardized exams during medical school. Then during your last year in medical school you will apply for residency training in internal medicine since you want to eventually become a cardiologist, which is an additional 3 years of training. <br>  <br>  During your internal medicine training, you will also need to apply for cardiology fellowship, which is probably the most competitive fellowship in internal medicine and will require at least 3 more years of training.<br>  <br>  As you can see, becoming a doctor is difficult, long, and huge committment. You will be ~32 years old when you finish your education and training to become a cardiologist (if you go straight to college after high school, then to medical school, and then residency + fellowship without any breaks in between) with about ~$100,000-200,000 debt in student loans. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck.<br>  Source(s):<br>  Currently a cardiology fellow.|`|AA11942204	Take all the science (including math) that you can. Biology, chemistry and math are the most important.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ydHU7gYIaa	there arent any courses in high school that relate to medicine, and med schools dont look at your high school grades at all. to get into med school you will need to earn a degree from a respectable undergrad institution, and you will need to take as many advanced placement courses as humanly possible and keep your gpa up around a 3.8 in order to have a shot at some of the better schools. saying you want to be a cardiologist this early though is totally jumping the gun; even people entering medical school generally are unsure of what type of physician they want to be (by the way, all med students take the same general courses; you learn your internal medicine practice first through residency, and then, for cardiology, youd also need to complete a fellowship), simply because they have no idea what its like to be a cardiologist and what kind of person it takes to succeed in that specialty (which is totally dedicated to work, extremely detail oriented with a gigantic learning capacity and memory). usually if someone says they want to do something so specific at this age its for the wrong reasons. youre looking at 4 yrs undergrad, 4 years med school and about 6-7 years post med school training, so its a long road and you literally have no life outside of medicine, trust me, so make sure you are in it for all the right reasons or you wont make it through (the only reason you should have at your age is because you are absolutely fascinated with the human heart. if youre not, its the wrong reason). also be aware that the courses you need to take in undergrad are rigorous and very tough, and you need to be amongst the top 10% of your class to be accepted to a medical school|`|SSe2GUnaaa	hmm some schools offer medical terminology ... <br>  you should ask your advisor ..

I would definitely choose Spanish. Its wider spoken and much easier than French.

Also, Spanish and French are very similar so if you've done French for so long and if you want to switch to Spanish, you could get muddled up a bit! French is also more useful in the world as there are LOADS of French speaking countries.<br>  <br>  History is the better of the two options as Unis love it if you do have it at A level even. But Geography is also equally fun. <br>  <br>  Pick those subjects you're good at or you like. I'd recommend a creative subject too, just in case!|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	well i think you should choose both spanish and french and pick either history or geography which one do yuu like the best ? but if yuu want a job in lanugages yuu shud defenitaly take both lanuages as the more yuu no the more yur paid.

Among his accomplishments he conquered Gaul (modern France and Belgium - 58-50 BC). He won a victory in the Civil War of 49-46 BC, and was dictator from 46-44 BC. He changed the Roman republic into a monarchy and a truly Mediterranean empire. He was launching a series of political and social reforms when he was assassinated by a group of nobles, as he was on his way to Pompey's Theater where the Senate convened.

So when we multiply √12 by √12 we will have 12 so our bottom is 12. and when you multiply the top by √12. its gona be √12 of course because you multiplied by 1. so our answer is √12/12. Or to more simpler it will be 2√3/12 which equal √3/6. all of this answers are the same.<br>  <br>  Remember that when you want to rationalise the denominator of anything you multiply the number in bottom by the bottom and top. and when you want to rationalise the numerator. you will multiply the numerator by the top and bottom as well.<br>  <br>  Hint: denominator=bottom<br>  Numerator=top|`|CgyMG0XGaa	1/√12 = 1/(2√3) = 1/(2√3) * √3/√3 = √3/6

s9tvr0DTaa	[edit] First Round Table Conference (November 1930 – January 1931)<br>  The Round Table Conference was opened officially by King George V on Thursday, November 13, 1930 and chaired by the British Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald. The Indian National Congress, along with Indian business leaders, kept away from the conference. Many of them were in jail for their participation in civil disobedience.<br>  <br>  However, the Conference was attended by Muslim leaders including Muhammad Ali, Muhammad Shafi, the Aga Khan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Muhammad Zafrulla Khan; Hindu Mahasabha leaders including B. S. Moonje and Jaylar; Liberals including Tej Bahadur Sapru, C. Y. Chintamani and Srinivasa Sastri; Sikh leaders including Sardar Ujjal Singh and a large contingent of rulers of princely states such as Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda, Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner, Nawab Hamidullah Khan of Bhopal and K.S. Ranjitsinhji of Nawanagar.<br>  <br>  The idea of an All-India Federation was moved to the centre of discussion. All the groups attending the conference supported this concept. The responsibility of the Executive to Legislature was discussed, and B. R. Ambedkar demanded a separate electorate for the Untouchables.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Second Round Table Conference (September – December 1931)<br>  There were three major differences between the first and second Round Table Conferences. By the second:<br>  <br>  Congress Representation — The Gandhi-Irwin Pact opened the way for Congress participation in this conference. Gandhi attended as the sole official Congress representative. Gandhi claimed that the Congress alone represented political India; that the Untouchables were Hindus and should not be treated as a “minority”; and that there should be no separate electorates or special safeguards for Muslims or other minorities. These claims were rejected by the other Indian participants. According to this pact, Gandhi was asked to call off the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and if he did so the prisoners of the British government would be freed excepting the criminal prisoners, i.e those who had killed British officials. <br>  National Government — two weeks earlier the Labour government in London had fallen. Ramsay MacDonald now headed a National Government dominated by the Conservative Party. <br>  Financial Crisis – During the conference, Britain went off the Gold Standard further distracting the National Government. <br>  During the Conference, Gandhi could not reach agreement with the Muslims on Muslim representation and safeguards. At the end of the conference Ramsay MacDonald undertook to produce a Communal Award for minority representation, with the provision that any free agreement between the parties could be substituted for his award.<br>  <br>  Gandhi took particular exception to the treatment of untouchables as a minority separate from the rest of the Hindu community. He clashed with the Untouchable leader, B. R. Ambedkar, over this issue: the two eventually resolved the situation with the Poona Pact of 1932.<br>  <br>  <br>  Third Round Table Conference (November – December 1932)<br>  From September 1931 until March 1933, under the supervision of Samuel Hoare, the proposed reforms took the form reflected in the Government of India Act 1935.<br>  <br>  Most of the main political figures of India were not present for this conference.<br>  <br>  In this conference, Chaudhary Rahmat Ali, a college student, coined the name PAKISTAN. Pakistan means the land of pure. He took the P from Punjab, the A from the Afghan, the KI from Kashmir, the S from Sindh and the TAN from Balochistan. In this Conference M.A.Jinnah was not present.

04hTn3vSaa	Well, if you are planning on going into the psychology/psychiatry fields, I would highly recommend taking AP Statistics. As a Psychology major, you will have to take a few Statistics courses. It will help you out A LOT to take it in high school. <br>  <br>  Also, AP Statistics is much easier than Calculus, AP or regular. You'll probably get a higher grade in AP Statistics, plus, you'll have a better chance of passing the AP test and getting college credits.<br>  <br>  <br>  The way it goes, is, Calculus is the math of finding Change. Statistics is the math of interpreting data. If you like math with more numbers and computations, go for calculus. If you prefer a math that is more ambiguous and requires more writing than it does numbers, go with statistics.|`|DjRCYuLXaa	You will deal with stats a lot in college and calculus very little.  AP classes look better than non AP for college applications and stats are relevant to your field of interest- go with stats.|`|xUCl2f6xaa	I think it depends on what type of school you're shooting for.  At a top school it would probably be advantageous to take the calculus class over the statistics class, even if the calculus class is not AP.  Calculus is generally deemed to be more 'impressive'.  <br>  <br>  Although the applications of statistics are plentiful, I think that taking calculus will help you gain a good foundation in the math that you may need as an undergrad (think Physics) and may do a little better to impress admissions officers.  If you really are motivated, you can always self-study and take the Statistics AP at the end of the year.<br>  <br>  Check out the following link, the person answering the question supports the same stance as I do.   <a href="http://www.collegeconfidential.com/dean/archives/which-math-course-looks-best-on-high-school-transcrip.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.collegeconfidential.com/dean/...</a>

AA10887916	Part of the art of writing successful essays is to hit the right level of detail.  Therefore you should rarely, if ever, seek to write a 'very detailed' essay in an exam.  What you need to do is provide just enough detail to demonstrate to the examiner that you can apply the main knowledge to some specific details (for example in English, give maybe a couple of examples to support your major idea, and ensure that you don't drill down too far into too much detail or support the same argument with 5 or 6 examples)|`|9x8tOaIyaa	As soon as you know what your topic is, on a separate piece of paper, jot down everything that comes to mind.  After doing this for 60 seconds to 1 minute, you are ready to start writing and as you write you'll have your thoughts together and jotted down to keep you writing right along, flowing with the stream. <br>  Good Luck!|`|a0E9CuELaa	I could never write an essay out of know where in an exam so I started learning off essays..genuinely ones with very broad topics, I would take a paragraph at a time, learn it cover it write it out then move on to para two, do the same thing again but when rewriting write out para one again and so on till you have learnt the essay, then go back and time yourself rewriting the whole thing till you can do it in the same time you will have in the exam, you'll never get it word for word but you will have the main points all there. You can also then write out a list of key points for each para to trigger your memory and link it with that para. Try buying this book called "mind mapping" and take IQ tablets, I swear by them..they improve your concentration and memory. good luck|`|ITFxQsKWaa	Practicing is always good. If you're getting hung up on content then a short outline will help keep you focused as you write.

zCOvQwQhaa	There are some really good programs online and some really bad programs online.  Just like there are some really good schools not online and some really bad ones.  It's not about online vs classroom at all.  It's about the reputation of the college.<br>  <br>  * How can I tell if it's legit?  Check their accreditation and their rankings.  You can check accreditation at <a href="http://www.chea.org/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chea.org/search/</a> and you can check their rankings at <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college" rel="nofollow">http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreview...</a><br>  <br>  * What is accredited?  Accreditation is a process schools go through to make sure that they meet a certain basic standard.  The government doesn't accredit schools (except in NY) but they recognize (or not) accreditors.  In the US, the most important accreditation for a college is called "regional accreditation" - if a school is regionally accredited then their coursework meets a standard that is likely to transfer to other colleges and will be accepted by most employers.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_accreditation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_ac...</a><br>  <br>  There are other accreditors though and some are important.  If you want a law degree then ABA accreditation is more important than regional.  If you want to become a teacher then approval of your state department of education is more important.  If you want to be a nurse then it will need to be approved to allow you to sit the NCLEX exam.  Each of these depends on particular professional requirements.  <br>  <br>  If you find the school in the US News rankings - it's not likely to have any real accreditation problems.  It may still have reputation problems though depending on how it's ranked.<br>  <br>  Your options for online education are far more than those "as seen on TV colleges" - I like the search tool at Petersons.com for finding programs.  <a href="http://www.petersons.com/distancelearning/code/search.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.petersons.com/distancelearnin...</a>  but don't forget to also look and see what your local community college and State U are offering online too.

See if their programs are accredited with other institutions or not.  Most of them are not.

I am therefore attending a different college that is accredited for this program.|`|soFzO7C2aa	check for a certification and discuss it with a counselor and maybe even discuss it with other universities. for instance if you are thinking about pheonix university online or baker online, go to the local "top" university and ask them. that way you can get what you need with your money.|`|CqqH12I8aa	it's perfectly fine if you go to an accredited college.

DvToP5h7aa	A Separate Peace - John Knowles<br>  <br>  What's Up With the Title?<br>  <br>  The phrase "separate peace" is a military term, and it's a bit complicated. If one nation has an alliance with another nation, it can refuse to fight that other nation's enemy by forming a separate peace. In other words, your best friend Betsy is at war with that pain-in-the-butt chick from shop class, Chelsea. As Betsy's friend, you're supposed to fight her battles with her, but you form a "separate peace" with Chelsea so that you can remain a bruise-free spectator. You're still allied with your friend Betsy, but you're out of the fray.<br>  <br>  Now check out the one mention of this phrase in the novel, at the end of Chapter Nine: "It wasn't the cider which made me surpass myself, it was this liberation we had torn from the gray encroachments of 1943, the escape we had concocted, this afternoon of momentary, illusory, special and separate peace." These lines offer us a second meaning, and this one with less military jargon. Just take the term literally – a separate peace. A peace that is separate from the rest of the world, isolated somehow, protected. Sound like Devon? Like youth? Exactly. The rest of the world is at war, but Gene and the other boys at Devon have achieved a peace outside of that war, a peace that is separate from it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/literary-device/literature/john-knowles/a-separate-peace/what-s-up-with-the-title.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/literary-device/li...</a>

Why would I want to go to college for another 4 or 6 YEARS".<br>  <br>  So, that's what we're fighting here.  Here are some of the reasons I've come up with (and also tried on my friends).  This first one a HS teacher explained to us.<br>  <br>  1.  Going to college for 4 years may seem like a lot of time.  You're young and 4 years looks like a long time to you.  However, over the grand view of it all 4 years (even 6) is not much....At 18 though 4 years is nearly 1/4 your life.  However, when you're 30 and valuing your education the most it's only 1/7.  As you get older this number will decrease BUT you'll still be valuaing your education even more.  So, it's natural at 18 to feel like it's a huge investment but, really it's not using up your whole life...it only feels that way.  (I hope this makes sence and you can explain that well to your friend.  lol)<br>  <br>  2.  Even though college is 4 years (or 6) it flys!  <br>  <br>  3.  You never stop learning.  At college you'll have a wealth of resources that help you to continue to learn.  College should nuture a desire to learn and give you every oppurtunity to succede.<br>  <br>  4.  COLLEGE IS NOT LIKE HS!!!  You have so much more freedom in college.  You decide what major and minor.  Although, there are some required classes in your major and some required general classes you have options about them and options when you take them and options who you take them with (generally).  You can make or break your scheduling and that is your free choice...(should see adviser for this reason).<br>  <br>  5. Tons of clubs and activities to do which your HS may not have offered.<br>  <br>  6.  There aren't a lot of jobs out there now and if he went and got an education while the market turned around he'd be ready for those higher up positions.  This is the perfect time to be getting your education and OUT of the job market.<br>  <br>  7.  How will he make it on his own?  Get a factory job for $13 an hour?  Okay...you know GM, Ford, all those people that worked for them w/ only HS degrees back 30 years ago thought they had it great.  Now they're wishing they had an education to fall back on.  I'm sorry but, it's true.  They had great jobs before the market fell but, now when a 4yr degree is required they have nothing to fall back on.<br>  <br>  Going to college invloves a natural drive.  If your friend doesn't have this drive it's very hard to instill.  Ask him if he'd like to go with you to visit a college (you get one day out of school and then the college signs that you were there).  Your friend may take you up on it.  Say, you visit the college then hang out and check the town and see what there is to do there...or if it's in your town go for lunch afterwards.  This is probably your best bet.  Again, sometimes people have to learn the hard way...it's a drive to better yourself which comes from within and sometimes it has to be developed on their own.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	Great that you found Montessori...I'm a little biased towards that.  :-)<br>  <br>  I would also suggest you start to look at:<br>  <br>  --Waldorf.  This is a very different form of education from Montessori and has a completely different environment.  If you visit   <a href="http://www.mothering.com/discussions" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothering.com/discussions</a>  scroll down to the education section.  There you will find a section on Waldorf (as well as one on Montessori).<br>  <br>  --Reggio Emelia is a system that follows the child.  As I understand it, the classroom is really designed from the students' interests.  So when the class starts to show an interest in something, the teacher prepares lessons to teach that.  That's my limited understanding of it.<br>  <br>  --Play Based preschool.  Many preschools call themselves play based and this is another type of environment you can look at.<br>  <br>  There are 3 more.

There are junior colleges in my area that will allow students who are still in high school to enroll in classes. There is usually a special application process for this and I'm including links to the JC in my area so you can see an example.<br>  <br>  If there is a junior college or college in your area, perhaps you could see if they have such a policy. If yes, the next step would be to coordinate talks with your family and school counselor to see if it would be possible and what it would take for them to help you attend.<br>  <br>  Moving away to the county at 16 or 17 does not sound realistic to me.

7rp50tUBaa	First don't listen to that person who said the choice is A he is totally wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  so the slope formula of a line passing through this points is y2-y1/x2-x1 (thats ur formula always). Then we will apply the numbers as follows<br>  <br>  (-7-3)/(-2-0)=-10/-2=5 so the slope is 5 but in the answer there is more than one 5 so we don't know which to choose. Notice the point (0,3) it means that the graph will touch the Y at 3 so our Y-intercept is 3. So the whole equation is y=5x+3. which is choice B<br>  <br>  if you have any questions let me know|`|t2P1ICQGaa	its A|`|5VKBBsA0aa	The answer is B: y = 5x + 3. You can simply substitute to check the answer. <br>  <br>  5(0) + 3 = 3 and 5(-2) + 3 = -7<br>  <br>  In general, you first find the slope, which is change in y over change in x and then use this slope to find the equation of the line passing through one of the points!|`|bDLB2i7Raa	The easy way out of this problem is just to "plug and chug".  Plug in the x and y values for both points, and only one of these equations will be true for both.<br>  <br>  E.g.  let's test A)  the first point (0, 3) means x = 0 and y = 3.  So I'll try (1/5)x + 3 = (1/5)*0 + 3 = 3 so that point fits.  <br>  <br>  Now try (-2, -7),  (1/5)*(-2) + 3 = 2.6 which doesn't = -7.  So A) isn't your answer.<br>  <br>  Keep trying the rest.|`|4be6c5b4c2a18bd2a8a48c2dff0419ceaa	one way is to use the point slope formula and finding the slope formula.<br>  <br>  slope formula: y(1) - y(2) / x(1) - x (2)<br>  <br>  so it'll be (-7 - 3) / (-2-0) = -10/-2 = 5<br>  <br>  slope = 5<br>  <br>  point slope formula: y - y(1) = m(x- x(1))<br>  <br>  could choose any point i prefer (0,3)<br>  <br>  so it'll be y-3 = 5x     <br>  <br>  y= 5x+3 <br>  <br>  so the answer is B|`|WJQLPGqsaa	The line cuts the y axis at +3, so the equation must end in that.

Slavery, & its possible expansion into the West, were the final impetus for the war. You don't still sell paper flowers @intersections do you, Moonie Fan???|`|3ioUdPuZaa	To me the greatest changes have been in "personal convictions" and the ability of people to face danger, and do "killer work" in order to have a better life. I might also add that these people had a GREAT FAITH that I think is totally lost, along with the HIGEST level of personal conviction to improve their life, with MOST in today's world. <br>  I have often thought WHAT COURAGE and STRENGTH it would have taken for these "common" people to move westward KNOWING they would likely lose children and loved ones, KNOWING they would face death at the hands of Indians, theives and just plain "low lives" that ran rampant just because their was little if ANY law. This is NOT to mention the fact they ALL knew they would likely face COLD and SNOW, Drought with no water or bad water and a lack of food along the way in different places. This generation lost hundreds JUST in influenza epidemics, not counting all the other diseases that are managed well today. Every family had to face the fact that the odds were they would lose AT LEAST one child (the hardest thing for anyone). And many, many, many lost multiple children. They forged westward, also knowing this MIGHT BE the last time they saw the loved ones they left behind. Once they set their sights westward, they KNEW they were leaving a LOT behind! Safety, life and family is a LOT to CHOOSE to take a chance on losing! Yet, their HOPE and DREAM of a "better life" or FREEDOM for their family, WAS WORTH IT TO MULTI-THOUSANDS!<br>  Think HARD about it and if you are like me, you see the picture of people who HAD to have a stronger faith than what anyone I know has today. Today's life is based on avoiding danger, not facing it and moving toward it. Today's life is based on LITTLE faith...we have grown so complacent and happy with "what we are given" that the very idea that we MUST have FAITH to live, or we WILL DEFINATELY DIE, is totally lost on most in today's world. <br>  Those folks who TOOK the challenge, KNEW they must have faith in GOD and KNEW they MUST have faith in their ability to provide for their families and themselves TOTALLY, because everyone else was busy staying alive themselves and the government didn't provide!<br>  Hope this helps<br>  Bunny7
UuYVehSsaa	Okay, <br>  Counter argument is challenging your argument. The thesis states your argument, SO after that say THOUGH SOME MAY SAY or<br>  <br>  You introduce this turn against with a phrase like One might object here that... or It might seem that... or It's true that... or Admittedly,... or Of course,... or with an anticipated challenging question: But how...? or But why...? or But isn't this just...? or But if this is so, what about...?

Everybody makes mistakes, even us nearly-perfect English teachers.  ;)|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	I don't know if she will or not. I wouldn't be pissed or embarrassed. Teachers are human and will make mistakes. When I am up at the board teaching, I am thinking about what I am teaching and not necessarily thinking about spelling. I tell my students that if they see me make a mistake, they need to tell me so that I can correct it. I don't try to play it off. just because you are a teacher doesn't mean that you are an expert speller. I guess that if you were teaching a spelling class, it would help that you could spell the spelling words. People have a problem with teachers and they think that a mistake or two shows that they are somehow unintelligent. I think that this is crazy. We are human just like anyone else.|`|G50ucmllaa	No.  She is probably a bit embarrassed, but not pissed.  Typically we all know more limitations and abilities so she may know very well that her spelling is lacking or perhaps she just made a mistake.  If she is pissed she needs to lighten up.|`|vbAu5SY3aa	No, why would she be pissed.

The factor preventing you from getting the job is that they are wanting a "native English speaker" and you can't check off that box.  There's no amount of certification that is going to change that box.  It's not fair but that's what's holding you up.<br>  <br>  Have you considered moving from TEFL to training TEFL teachers?  With an MA and the experience, you should be able to find that job.<br>  <br>  Or, have you considered teaching your native language to speakers of English?

mdUY0xehaa	Perhaps if his son was planning on following the same career as his father, he could give his son an internship position. Going above and beyond in community service also helps. If grades aren't your strong point, you need to focus on bringing your smarts or another personality trait out into the light. Whats your passion? Enter competitions in the same track: you might just win! If it's something you probably couldn't enter a competition for, I would suggest doing internships or community service related to the subject.<br>  <br>  If you're lacking in time, getting someone important that your father knows who knows you to write you a good letter of recommendation is important.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|ldzDqqUcaa	i think it would help if you had money and that's not me being mean but it really helps i know many people that go to these sort of places and usually they have money

IsozKRNeaa	The bombing of Pearl Harbor.|`|3ioUdPuZaa	Hitler had ALREADY began his campaign to become leader of the WORLD by conquering it. Most of Europe was beseiged by him, but he was a 'sly' fox and was doing it in a way that would "hide" what his true intentions were. The war was almost OVER before the world new the TRUTH about what he had been doing to Jews for years. He was like a snake slithering through each country as he saw his abiliity to do so and even sometimes staging acts supposedly committed against Germany to gain public SUPPORT for his marching agaist other countries. According to Vets that were part of this great war, there were RUMORS of atrocities agaist Jews and others, but no evidence to back it up ( of course NOT...the victims were being killed and COULD'NT tell anyone). Also, we must remember that especially in that time in History, the idea that one nation, like Germany would "somehow lodge a campain based on irradicating the world of Jews was just not a thing that could be easily BELIEVED if heard) Great Britain and other countries were already in dire trouble, but the British were FIGHTING HARD and managing to JUST keep Hitler at 'bay.'<br>  Then, suddenly without warning, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in the Hawaian Islands. THIS was a direct and unexpected act against America, itself. Thousands of innocent lives were lost. <br>  They seized the opportunity thinking the WORLD was concentrating on Hitler, to attempt what MANY countries ultimately want...control over and the total conquering of the United States. What better time to do so than when ALL of Europe "had its hands full" with Hitler. They knew virtually NO help would be had from our allies because they were busy trying to stay ALIVE, and they thought a surprise hit on the United States would make it possible for them to "slip" in our back door with little trouble! And had an unexpected "stop" in their attack NOT HAPPENED, they may very well have succeeded! America just was sitting back and WASN'T ready!<br>  Vets will tell you that a surprising thing happened...when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, they didn't continue the attacks for a long period of time!<br>  The United States who had actually been begged by the Europeans to HELP and had "declined" had NO CHOICE but to act when the bombing occurred. And the "lull" between actions by the Japanese gave the United States TIME together **** forces and join the common allies in fighting back...both Hitler AND the Japanese. Of course the allies were NOT going to help us without some help coming their way, also! Especially since they had been begging the US to no avail to HELP THEM...so the United States HAD to join forces and fight, in order to SAVE the United States from probable future attacks from Japan. Except for the Civil War, NO WAR or foreign fighting has been able to reach the shores of the United States...we have never been bombed or attacked. (Until 9-11 of course). <br>  So this "close call" at Pearl Harbor WAS on American Soil and HAD to be dealt with. <br>  This is the conditions that led to decisions made to "join" the war. <br>  A very different picture than most people were taught in school. The United States DID not join to fight Hitler or help Europe or the Jews, but only JOINED the fight when Pearl Harbor was bombed and they knew they had no other choices!<br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Bunny7

In Ohio, preschool teachers must be "Highly Qualified" meaning they must hold certification in Early Childhood.  Certification requires a B.A. and everything that is required of other teachers.  In Ohio teachers are certified Pre-K through 3rd grade.  Private day care settings, Head Start settings, and preschools outside of public school systems have lower standards to meet.|`|0qJfXlURaa	Depends on the state, since all states set their own requirements. It also depends on where you want to work. The requirements for working as a preschool teacher in a public school are often very different.<br>  <br>  Unless you desire a long-term career in preschool, it makes more sense to get a full teaching credential rather than to complete a certification program. While it may seem like more work, the time required is nearly exactly the same in most cases. With a full credential you will also have an advantage over those job-seekers who only have the minimum required certification.|`|i5tOQGgFaa	It depends on which type of program you want to be affiliated with.

Some areas simply require one to be 18 (no college or even high school), most require more.

Some only accept 4 year degrees.<br>  <br>  So basically, it depends on the laws in your area and the child care center itself.

iXwA5wAlaa	I am afraid I could only find aa difference printed in relation to cutlery, you would have to look at the difference in price between a hand forged and a tempered katana.<br>  <br>  A forge is what a blacksmith uses to heat metal in order to shape it. Hand forged means the metal was heated and shaped by hand, not machine (as in a steel factory.) The term hand forged has come to mean created by hand, without a machine. It applies to metals, but I have also heard it used for other materials.<br>  Tempering is a heat treatment technique for metals and alloys. In steels, tempering is done to "toughen" the metal. It is made hard or flexible or resilient especially by heat treatment; "a sword of tempered steel"<br>  FORGED: This is the top of the line in quality. It's one of the oldest methods of construction using handcraftsmanship, producing the strongest and sharpest blade.<br>  Tempered, blades are tempered sharpened, and finished, but machines handle most of the process. The blade of a stamped knife is fitted into its handle and is not considered one fluid piece of equipment. They are usually thinner, lighter and lack the balance of forged knives; therefore, requiring a firmer grip and more pressure when chopping, mincing, etc.They are usually priced lower than forged.

We used two soup cans with small holes punched in the bottom, then a string was passed thru the holes and knotted so it'd stay.<br>  <br>  When the string was held taut, on could talk into one can and the other could listen at the other.  Speech or noise vibration would be transmitted from the can to the string and the other can would pick up the vibrations.  It didn't work very well, but if one talked slow and clearly, some words could be understood.<br>  <br>  Was that your question?|`|eNulfbs7aa	Oh my word..that is fabulous...they are using their imagination and creativity...encourage this!  Also they can use string to make playhouses outside by affixing it to trees and sectioning off rooms.  If you live where there is pine straw or leaves this works well too.  This is much better than store bought toys and cheaper too, because it fosters the imagination and allows them to be creative instead of a piece of plastic.

Nl4ySL3Faa	If you have completed all of the core requirements by spring, then definitely take the test in the spring. However, if you will not have them completed until summer, you may be better off waiting until then. The key is that you should take the MCAT as soon after you have completed the required premedical courses (general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and biology). If you are applying to schools for early decision, however, then the spring test time is your only option. Also, remember that most schools have rolling admissions policies, so waiting until August before your senior year may put you at a big disadvantage, as your applications will not be complete until October at the earliest. By the way, if you will have finished all of the required courses by August before your junior year, you may want to consider taking the MCAT at that time. This will give you a chance to retake the test the following April if necessary without falling behind in the application process.|`|JpDLQBitaa	Take a look at the link below and find whats the best date for you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aamc.org/students/mcat/mcatschedule.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aamc.org/students/mcat/mcatsc...</a>

His books have made a lasting impression on every generation since he began publishing them in 1937. His name is as common as a household appliance throughout the United States. But where did he get his ideas? How did he start writing? His life is as fascinating as his wonderful books.<br>  <br>  <br>  As a young man, he worked for an oil company writing ads that consisted of cartoon drawings of people. This began his love for writing and drawing. In 1937, while on a trip, he was inspired to write his first book, To Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street. He used the name Dr. Seuss, because he wanted to use his real name for more serious books. Seuss was his middle name, and he put Dr. in front of it because his father always wanted him to be a doctor.<br>  <br>  In 1954, Dr. Seuss read an article that said children were having trouble learning how to read in schools across the country. The article mentioned that the reason for this was because children found the books boring. This inspired Dr. Seuss to try to write for beginner readers. He took a list of 250 words that schools were teaching kids, and incorporated all of them into one book called The Cat in the Hat. The book was an instant success of course!<br>  <br>  In 1960, a friend of Dr. Seuss bet him $50 that he couldn’t write a book using only 50 words. Dr. Seuss won the bet by writing Green Eggs and Ham. He never did get his 50 dollars, but he created a fun book for children.<br>  <br>  In total, Dr. Seuss has written and illustrated 44 children’s books, has won the Pulitzer Prize and has won 3 Academy Awards. On September 24, 1991, at the age of 87, Theodor Seuss Geisel passed away. However, his books are still enjoyed by children and adults alike, and he’s sure to be an author that is never forgotten!|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i think you could make the argument that lots of people were inspired to become early readers due to his books<br>  kids love that stuff, so if they start enjoying reading early ultimately it will affect them for the rest of their lives whether they give credit or not

In THIS fake facsimile of life, there are no boundaries and kids can "cross lines" that are not allowed in our society today without criminal prosecution and severe consequences. Like SLOW brain-washing, they begin to become numb to the reality of death or the real consequences of "stepping over forbidden lines."<br>  It happened slowly, from a harmless attempt to provide entertainment and open new paths for technology, but the end result (as we can clearly see evidence of everywhere in our society today) is a generation...or TWO that lack the moral fortitude and conscience of those young people who lived real life, not so many years ago. Without taking extreme and serious action to correct the harm done, we will continue to see video based violence and generations of youth numb to the realities of violence.
NPtz1Y4Taa	The role of mobile telecommunications in the 21st century<br>  By Kate Fox<br>  <br>  Executive Summary<br>  Gossip is not a trivial pastime: it is essential to human social, psychological and even physical well-being. The mobile phone, by facilitating therapeutic gossip in an alienating and fragmented modern world, has become a vital 'social lifeline', helping us to re-create the more natural communication patterns of pre-industrial times.<br>  <br>  Key findings:<br>  Mobile gossip is good for us<br>  Gossip is the human equivalent of 'social grooming' among primates, which has been shown to stimulate production of endorphins, relieving stress and boosting the immune system. Two-thirds of all human conversation is gossip, because this 'vocal grooming' is essential to our social, psychological and physical well-being. Mobiles facilitate gossip. Mobiles have increased and enhanced this vital therapeutic activity, by allowing us to gossip 'anytime, anyplace, anywhere' and to text as well as talk. Mobile gossip is an effective and important new stress-buster.<br>  <br>  Mobile phones are the new garden fence<br>  The space-age technology of mobile phones has allowed us to return to the more natural and humane communication patterns of pre-industrial society, when we lived in small, stable communities, and enjoyed frequent 'grooming talk' with a tightly integrated social network. In the fast-paced modern world, we had become severely restricted in both the quantity and quality of communication with our social network. Mobile gossip restores our sense of connection and community, and provides an antidote to the pressures and alienation of modern life. Mobiles are a 'social lifeline' in a fragmented and isolating world. <br>  <br>  Additional findings:<br>  Men gossip as much as women. The study found that men gossip at least as much as women, especially on their mobiles. Thirty-three percent of men indulge in mobile gossip every day or almost every day, compared with twenty-six percent of women. Men gossip for just as long and about the same subjects as women, but tend to talk more about themselves. The study did find a sex difference in 'gossip partners', with men more likely to gossip with work colleagues, partners and female friends, while women gossip more with same-sex friends and family. Male and female gossip also sounds different, as women use more animated tones, more detail and more feedback.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mobile as 'symbolic bodyguard'. Women use their mobile phones as 'symbolic bodyguards' when feeling vulnerable in public places – in the way that they used to use a newspaper of magazine as a 'barrier signal'. <br>  <br>  <br>  The joy of text. Texting is particularly important in maintaining contact with a wide social network – allows us to maintain social bonds even when we do not have the time, energy, inclination or budget for calls or visits. Texting re-creates the brief, frequent, spontaneous 'connections' with members of our social network that characterised the small communities of pre-industrial times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Teenage social skills. Texting helps teenagers (and some adult males) to overcome awkwardness and inhibitions and to develop social and communication skills – they communicate with more people, and more frequently, than they did before mobiles.<br>  <br>  <br>  Text as 'trailer'. Mobile gossip is enhanced by the use of the text message as a 'trailer', alerting friends to the fact that one is in possession of an interesting item of gossip, but saving the details for a phone call or meeting.<br>  <br>  <br>  Entertainment. Women are more skilled than men at making gossip entertaining – three factors are involved: highly animated tone, plenty of detail and enthusiastic 'feedback'.<br>  <br>  <br>  Risk-therapy. Enjoyment of gossip is also about the thrill of risk-taking, doing something a bit naughty, talking about people's 'private' lives – this is particularly important for the reserved and inhibited English, but all humans have inbuilt need for risk-taking.<br>  <br>  <br>  Benefits of negative gossip. Only about five per cent of gossip-time is devoted to criticism and negative evaluation of others – but this 'negative gossip' has clear social benefits in terms of rule-learning and social bonding.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Introduction<br>  The subject of gossip is increasingly attracting the attention of researchers in social psychology, anthropology, evolutionary psychology, sociolinguistics and social history. Even philosophers are being drawn in to the debate. Although the word 'gossip' was originally a positive or at least neutral term (deriving from 'God-sibb' – a person related to one in God, a close friend or companion), it has more recently acquired some pejorative connotations. Yet most of the research highlights the positive social and psychological functions of gossip: facilitating relationship-building, group bonding, clarification of social position and status, reinforcing shared values, conflict resolution and so on.

trKgx3Ukaa	I am currently taking online degrees in engineering and law. <br>  <br>  I have also completed a science degree online at another university. <br>  <br>  In both instances, there is a lot of interaction between students and between students and professors.

Here in the U.S. having gone to Harvard will stand out, but if the overall GPA for the student that attended Harvard is lower than the student that attended a lesser known state university, the one with the higher GPA is going to stand a better chance.  Of course there is more they look at- GRE scores, letters of recommendation, letter of intent/personal interest, etc.  Go to the university you feel is best for you, do the best you possibly can, and then go on to grad school.|`|7ff91aea1d5f9f19f507ddbc78ae0251aa	it wont be the factor but it will be looked at. all a collage has is its name really, they have to build that up and so the name like a brand does look good and at some schools a 4.0 gpa is easier to obtain than at another. so yes it does matter to a degree but that will be one of the last things they look at

DjRCYuLXaa	job: Physics Graduate Student<br>  name: Rhea Braun<br>  I am in training to be a physicist but as I am being paid at this point I consider my current training a job<br>  1) I take classes like you, but I usually only take one or two classes at a time.  I have one homework assignment every week that can take about ten hours for each class.  I have 2-3 tests each semester that I have to study for as well.  I also work in a laboratory.  My responsibilities include building an experimental apparatus, upkeep for it, operating it, writing computer codes to analyze the results I get from the apparatus, writing papers about these results, explaining these results to people in oral presentations, and publishing papers on these results.<br>  <br>  2,3) I was always good at math in school and loved it.  I liked building things, too.  Someone once told me that quantum mechanics was too hard for me to learn at my age, and that it violates determinism.  Determinism is a theory that says we don't have free will and we can't make our own choices.  I didn't like determinism and I didn't like people telling me I couldn't learn quantum mechanics because I was too young, so I started to pursue physics. (quantum mechanics is a part of physics the way anatomy is a part of biology) Once I started to take physics classes I loved them, so I kept at it. Here's a secret- I did not like biology or chemistry much in school I felt like I was memorizing things.  In physics there are only a few principles I have to know and I derive everything else from those.<br>  <br>  4) If I wasn't a physicist I would like to be a sculptor/artist because I love to create new things, or maybe an engineer, because they also use math and physics and create new things. I am also very interested in the history and philosophy of science so I might like to study that.<br>  <br>  5) first, physics is a lot of work.  I have essentially two jobs, the first is being a student and the second is research.  I easily work 60 hours a week and sometimes work up to 80 hours a week.<br>  I went to an undergraduate college to get my bachelors degree.  That can cost a lot of money from 15,000 to 45,000 dollars a semester- not including your dorm room, your food, your books and school supplies.  I am currently in a phd program.  That means when I graduate I will have a doctorate in physics.  They pay me fairly little 19,000-30,000 dollars a year depending on which school you go to, but its usually around 21,000 dollars.  I will go to school and work here for 4-8 years.  when I get out I'll be 26-30 years old.  Many of my friends and people my age will already have babies, houses and families and the job they plan to have until they retire.  I will then get a post-doctoral position which lasts about 2 years and pays about the same as my current wages.  Then I'll get a job as a professor or in industry.  If I try to be a professor For the first five years they could fire me at any time, and they don't pay me too much. At the end of those five years I have to apply for tenure If they think I did well for those five years they will give me a raise and it will become very difficult to fire me.  If they don't think i did well the fire me, and I go to another school where I may or may not get tenure right away. I don't know what happens if I go into industry<br>  <br>  6)It is more work than I imagined but I like it more than I imagined so it pretty much evens out.<br>  <br>  7) I have worked as a research assistant in a lab, and as a teaching assistant helping kids outside of class who are taking classes that I have previously taken.|`|HIMsPI8eaa	Maybe ask them to tell you what their average day @ work is like or ask them to share an interesting story from their work.

Alaska's home to a variety of valuable minerals. <br>  <br>  Last century, Alaska miners pursued rich gold placer deposits and black seams of coal. This century, Alaska's miners will increasingly seek out titanium sands, palladium placers, kimberlite pipes or niobium nuggets. There's gold in the hills to be sure, but increasingly valuable titanium, rare earths and, particularly, metals from the platinum group are even now beginning to catch more and more attention from the mining industry here in Alaska. <br>  <br>  Similarly, Alaska mines are targeting such products as calcium carbonate, high-quality slab marbles and-just plain hard rock. A quarry on Annette Island under development by the Metlakatla Indian Corp. contains, well, hard rock. <br>  <br>  "Surprisingly, it's hard to find rock that is unfractured and stands up to abrasion, rock that's suitable for heavy duty rip rap," said Dick Swainbank, development specialist with the state division of mining and minerals in Fairbanks. <br>  <br>  A handful of geologists are convinced Alaska could be the source of diamonds--found typically in association with a geologic formation called a kimberlite pipe. Kimberlite has been found in the Northwest Territories of Canada, and in the 1990s the discoveries there sparked a staking rush equal to that of the Klondike a century earlier. In Alaska, raw diamonds have occasionally turned up in placer claims in the Circle City area. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allbusiness.com/north-america/united-states-alaska/675486-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allbusiness.com/north-america...</a>
