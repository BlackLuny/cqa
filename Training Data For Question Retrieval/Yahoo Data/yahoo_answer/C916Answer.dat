For that, go to NSE's website at <a href="http://www.nseindia.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nseindia.com</a> and then click on IPO tab given on top (6th one from left). Then click 'Past issues thru NSE'. Then select the year for which you are seeking the information. <br>  Like, for example, I-Flex Solutions was listed on NSE on 28th June 2002. You will get this information if you select the year 2002, ok.<br>  <br>  Now, since you want the List prices and you already know their Listing dates (through above-mentioned procedure), you can get the 'Bhavcopy' or market prices of all scrips on that date.<br>  <br>  Click 'Equity' on top tab (2nd from left). Then click 'Historical Data' under 'Market Information' as given on left menu bar. Then click 'Archives'. A new page will open. Select 'Bhavcopy' under 'Equity'. Enter the date at the end of the page and retrieve the information. So, to know list price of I-Flex Solutions, you will search for Bhavcopy as on 28-06-2002, got it?<br>  <br>  Now, the List Price would be the 'Opening Price' of that scrip on that day as it got listed on that day. In case of I-Flex, it was issued at Rs.530, while it opened (or got listed) at Rs.550. Got it?<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|cWuumdy7aa	log onb to moneycontro.com and enter scrip name and you will get whole history of the scrip

That will depend on your long-term plans about returning to work. You should be able to tell by if he has given you form P45 or not. If you have form P45 you can do form P50.

A lot of people buy houses on informal rent-to-own type arrangements and that does not count because the title doesn't pass to the buyer for a while.  But if title to the home as passed to you, you can claim the credit.<br>  <br>  If you bought it before 1/1/09, you have to claim it on your 2008 taxes.  If you have filed already, you have to amend it.<br>  <br>  If you bought after 1/1/09, you can claim it on your 2008 or you can wait and claim it on your 2009 taxes.<br>  <br>  Either way, just include form 5406 on  your tax return and they will tack the credit onto you refund.

It is where all accounting transactions are posted in a double entry system using debits (on the left) and credits (on the right) for each transaction. An additional column to the far right can keep a running total of activity in the account, similar to your checkbook.<br>  <br>  The general ledger provides data for the Balance Sheet and either the Single-Step Income Statement or the Multi-Step Income Statement (depending on which one the company prepares.) The ledger can be electronic or physical depending on whether you are using computer software or a manual system. Most companies use a computerized version of the general ledger, allowing for greater ease of entry and reporting.<br>  <br>  All accounts in the chart of accounts are grouped in one of five categories: Assets, Liabilities, Owner's Equity, Revenue, and Expenses. The general ledger is organized according to the chart of accounts, with a separate register, file, page, or card for each account.|`|f6dxZXPGaa	The general ledger is the core of your companyâs financial records. These constitute the central âbooksâ of your system, and every transaction flows through the general ledger. These records remain as a permanent track of the history of all financial transactions since day one of the life of your company.<br>  <br>  Subledgers and the General Ledger<br>  Your accounting system will have a number of subsidiary ledgers (called subledgers) for items such as cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. All the entries that are entered (called posted) to these subledgers will transact through the general ledger account. For example, when a credit sale posted in the account receivable subledger turns into cash due to a payment, the transaction will be posted to the general ledger and the two (cash and accounts receivable) subledgers as well.<br>  <br>  There are times when items will go directly to the general ledger without any subledger posting. These are primarily capital financial transactions that have no operational subledgers. These may include items such as capital contributions, loan proceeds, loan repayments (principal), and proceeds from sale of assets. These items will be linked to your balance sheet but not to your profit and loss statement.<br>  <br>  Setting up the General Ledger<br>  There are two main issues to understand when setting up the general ledger. One is their linkage to your financial reports, and the other is the establishment of opening balances.<br>  <br>  The two primary financial documents of any company are their balance sheet and the profit and loss statement, and both of these are drawn directly from the companyâs general ledger. The order of how the numerical balances appear is determined by the chart of accounts , but all entries that are entered will appear. The general ledger accrues the balances that make up the line items on these reports, and the changes are reflected in the profit and loss statement as well.<br>  <br>  The opening balances that are established on your general ledgers may not always be zero as you might assume. On the asset side, you will have all tangible assets (the value of all machinery, equipment, and inventory) that is available as well as any cash that has been invested as working capital. On the liability side, you will have any bank (or stockholder) loans that were used, as well as trade credit or lease payments that you may have secured in order to start the company. You will also increase your stockholder equity in the amount you have invested, but not loaned to, the business.<br>  <br>  The General Ledger Creates an Audit Trail<br>  Donât let the word audit strike fear in your heart; I am not talking about a tax audit. Although, if you are called to respond to an outside audit for any reason, a well-maintained general ledger is essential.<br>  <br>  But you will also want an internal trail of transaction so that you can trace any discrepancy (such as double billing or an unrecorded payment) through your own system. You must be able to find the origin of any transaction in order to verify its accuracy, and the general ledger is where you will do this. !!!|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	Cooking.

XsZsk55Jaa	The statutes governing 401K loans do not place restrictions on what the loans are used for except that the loans must be reasonably available to all participants.   Beyond that it is completely up to your employer.  The law doesn't require them to allow loans at all.  Some don't allow any loans whatsoever.  Others couldn't care less and even allow loans to pay off credit cards, buy a car, or take a vacation.<br>  <br>  The costs of administering the loan are all paid for by the employer which is why they place restrictions on what the loan can be used for;  they don't want too many.
j594tJT7aa	Personally when I go for a job...  I like to first go to the place and apply in person if at all possible.  Take all your information with you in a neat binder because they will see you as an organized person ready to work from that apperance<br>  <br>  After you fill out the paperwork...  ask for the name of the person who will be determining your position if hired or that you will be directly reporting to when hired and a number where they can be reached.  Then go home and starting the next day, call them everyday (at different times because then they will not know when you will call next. Calling at the same time gives them the chance to avoid your calls if they wish) and ask to speak to the person who's name you were told would be your boss or contact at the jobsite.   If they are unavaliable to speak with, the ask if you may leave a message for them and if they could kindly return your call when it is most convinient for them.<br>  <br>  Also, stop by periodically throughout the week and ask to speak to this person.  This shows that you are really wanting to work and are very interested in being an employee for that company.  It also shows you are a self motivated person (or better put a self starter)!

If on the other hand we "Go short" we are hoping for a decrease in price to provide our gain. In either case we are speculating because we cannot know what will happen to the stocks price in the future. There is low risk speculation and high risk speculation either of which can result in low return, high return, no return at all or a loss.<br>  <br>  A non-speculative stock investment would be one in which the issue of share-price increase or decrease is of little or no concern.

4f3GfrN6aa	Take that credit card and cut it up.  Then leave it at home.  <br>  <br>  An 18 year old does not need a credit card.  I'm nearly 30 and I've never needed one.  And don't let anyone tell you you need it to build credit.  That's a load of crap.  You can get a loan without a credit card so long as you pay your bills on time.  And spending heaps on your credit card is doing nothing for your credit.<br>  <br>  You need to set yourself up so it's easier for you to succeed.  So cut up the credit card and leave the pieces at home.  That way, if you ever do have a legitimate emergency (like you need to book an emergency plane flight to Brisbane for a funeral or something else very serious) you can still use the card over the phone.  <br>  <br>  You need to come to Target without your wallet.  If you see something you really like, put it on hold for 3 days so you can think about it.  That's what I do.  I work at Target too.  I know what it's like.  You see this great stuff and you think "I really want that!" but you don't really need it.  So put stuff on hold, and if you still want it after thinking about it for a few days, come back and get it.  That means going home, getting your wallet, and coming back to get it, not taking your wallet with you to work.  The extra effort will make you question whether it is actually worth it.<br>  <br>  Now, I'd go to the cash office and ask if they will deposit your wage over multiple bank accounts.  If they will, you can set up a separate bank account and transfer a specific amount of your wage into that account every pay day.  If they don't, set the account up anyway, and then set up a direct debit from your bank account to that other account each pay day.  That way, you save automatically.  Make sure you leave some money in the original account to cover the direct debit when your pay is delayed by a public holiday.  It's easy to get caught out, but you can do this with some discipline. I'd aim for 10% of what you earn, but since you're a teenager and probably living at home, you could afford to save a lot more.<br>  <br>  You need to have a list of things you can do to comfort yourself and keep yourself amused that DO NOT involve spending money.  Go for a walk.  Knit.  Read a book.  Get on the internet and read the news (NO EBAY!)  Write a letter for Amnesty International.  There MUST be something else you enjoy.  I love finance, so I get on the internet and keep abreast of the latest market activity.  Most people find that intensely coma inducing, but it works for me.<br>  <br>  You are just impulse spending, and believe me, it can make you feel pretty rotten when you feel like you don't have an alternative.  It is also tempting when you work somewhere like Target.  I know what it's like.  So leave the credit card at home.  If you must take money, take a very limited amount of cash only, so that you can only spend a limited amount.  <br>  <br>  I work with another woman at a department store and she spends ALL her money on crap they don't need.  Her partner came in one day and she was showing him some cds and he says "why do we need these?" and she goes "well, they're cheap."  You DO NOT want to turn into this woman, okay?  So build some basic cash management techniques now, before your behaviour gets intrenched.  They are broke.  He is a professional on a good wage and they can barely make house payments because of her spending.  <br>  <br>  Have a goal.  I suggest you try to save $1000 by the end of the year, but you should choose a personal saving goal.  Then, when you've got some cash together, go to your bank and ask if they have a financial planner on staff, because some banks do, and it's free to see them (you pay a commission out of your investment).  They can help you set your investments up now so when you're my age, you have a decent house deposit or a nice little nest egg.<br>  <br>  You can totally do this.  You aren't wrong or bad.  You just have some dodgy habits that you can fix if you put some strategies in place.  First, leave the credit card and ATM card at home, and take only a limited amount of cash with you.  That way, you can't break the bank.  I suggest no more than $5 or $10.  That will cover a bus fare.  Also, don't buy your lunch on your break.  Take something from home.  It is FAR cheaper to do this.  Buy a packet of biscuits and take a few with you for your break.  That is cheaper than going to a cafe and getting it, and you'll also get your entire break to yourself.<br>  <br>  Have a list of 'alternatives' you can do when you feel down.  Go through that list and do whichever one is most appropriate at the time.  Keep a copy in your wallet.  <br>  <br>  As for the boredom and loneliness, why don't you try a short course?  They are normally pretty cheap, and it's a good way to meet people.  You might find one on something that interests you.  You should try to get out and do something that doesn't involve money.  You could join a community group or something.  Check out what is available in your area.<br>  <br>  This isn't the end of the wor|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I know you're young but in a matter of a few years you will be an adult. At some point in life you will be forced by circumstances to handle your money wisely. You probably still live at home and have no other expenses so it's easy to give into your impulsive spending. If you ever want to leave home and be independent  you'll have to woman up and act like a responsible adult. Don't carry your credit card with you. Tear it up or leave it at home. That will make you wait at least one day to buy that item you feel you just have to have and it would be best if you made yourself wait two days. It's a habit you've developed and one you will have to break no matter how hard it is. I assume your parents are  paying the charge card bills now.  Start paying the  monthly payments   yourself. DO NOT have any late payments, if you have to ask your parents to lend you the difference in what you owe and how much money you have. You're also going to ruin your credit if you fail to make timely payments. When you cure yourself of this obsessive spending you can make friends. It's probably making you look like a spoiled brat to some people and perhaps giving an aura of superiority to those who cannot spend at will as you can.|`|CL9zXIA7aa	You're a shopoholic.

Stay for about 6 months to a year and carry that experience to another bigger and better place.

d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	The Federal Reserve is a unique legal entity that can be described as an independent government agency with member bank participation. It is organized with a 100% government agency at the top (the Board of Governors), and branches beneath them that are organized like corporations with member banks as shareholders.(Ref: <a href="http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101/structure/" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/f...</a> , <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm#4" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinf...</a> )<br>  <br>  The Board of Governors are all appointed for 14-year terms by the president and confirmed by congress. It operates per it's charter and laws set by congress. it is overseen by congress. There is no structure or mechanism for private ownership at this level; it is a government agency. You can confirm this from a number of government sites that list it as a government agency (e.g. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/independent-agencies.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ind...</a> Board members are forbidden by law to have any economic interest in a private bank. (Ref: Title 12 chapter 3 of the U.S. Legal Code). The Board determines monetary policy and provides high level oversight of the branches. <br>  <br>  The 12 branches can be considered highly regulated private corporations. Member banks are required to buy shares in their branch. Each bank has one vote.  They can vote for 6 of their 9 board members, the other 3 are appointed by the Board of Governors.  Though the branches are called non-profit, the member banks get a standard 6% dividend on their shares. The remaining 'profit' is turned over to the Treasury at the end of the year. <br>  <br>  For confirmation on this, check out how Hoovers classifies them: <br>  <a href="http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simple/xmillion/index.xhtml?query_string=Federal+Reserve&which=company&page=1&x=91&y=2#HooversCompanyNameMatchesH2" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simpl...</a> <br>  <br>  And those shares that the member banks own? Some say there are so many restrictions that it falls short of true ownership<br>  <br>  From Edward Griffin, noted anti-fed intellect (<a href="http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)</a><br>  <br>  "It's a hybrid, part corporation and part government, part private, part government.<br>  .. <br>  Every bank that's in the system is an owner of the Federal Reserve...  But that's as far as it goes because those stock certificates do not carry with them any of the attributes of private ownership. For example, the holders of these certificates cannot sell them. If you can't sell something then you don't really own it, that's one of the tests of ownership, your ability to dispose of it. You cannot sell it. Furthermore the larger banks put up more money than the smaller banks, it's a ratio to their assets, so the larger banks have more stock certificates in the system than the small ones and yet regardless of the number that they hold, every bank has just one vote. There's another violation of the principle of private ownership. Furthermore that vote doesn't buy them anything. They can't vote for anything of substance; they cannot vote for their national management which is the most important thing, isn't it? The board of directors and chairman of the Federal Reserve System are appointed by the President, they're not elected by the banks that are part of the system, the President does that."|`|qtL0YQUQaa	Go to wikipedia and type Federal Reserve System.

The advice is free, they have specialist employment advisers, they are on your side.<br>  <br>  Just based on what you are saying here, unless there is more to it that you are not telling us, the employer doesn't have a leg to stand on - your husband would be due pay and compensation.|`|FBATabA0aa	Find a company that has declared bankruptcy recently and no longer functions.

SK2gGFoyaa	Your $55,000 of debt isn't going to change if you have one creditor or 55 of them. Your parents are co-signers and their credit will be dinged if you don't pay and enhanced if you do. It's time for a budget. Don't spend money you don't have. Pay off your debts asap by selling things you have, working a second job, asking creditors for lower interest rates, using cash only, and/or a combination of whatever it takes to set your goals and achieve them. The answer for you is to increase income, reduce expenses, and pay on time as much as you can on the debts. I agree with the post who mentions Dave Ramsey. If you think getting out of debt is easy, it's not. It takes determination and time. You didn't get in debt overnight so you won't dismiss it overnight either. Consolidation is not an answer... pay the bills!!!|`|aCDWwsisaa	You should sell your car and your parents' car(s) and home(s) and pay off the debt, since they are co-signers they are as legally liable as you are so there is nothing else you can do to "protect their credit"...<br>  <br>  You may want to reconsider "putting it all together in one payment", that achieves absolutely nothing...<br>  <br>  And read some of Dave Ramsey's books...

DAMZKbpDaa	If you donated a car to charity, you could take the amount the charity sold it for (they should send you a letter) as in itemized deduction on Sch-A. <br>  <br>  To be able to claim $10,000 as an itemized deduction, you would need income in excess of $20,000, otherwise it gets carried forward.<br>  <br>  It is not a "tax credit," as implied by the question.|`|AA10469473	A non-profit is not necessarily a charity where you can deduct contributions.  To be able to deduct anything, they must have what's called 501(c)3 designation from the IRS.  Many non-profits, like social organizations, homeowners associations, and kids sports teams are not 501(c)3. <br>  If you make a donation to a 501(c)3 organization and IF you itemize, you can deduct the donation.  If you don't itemize, then you get no tax benefit. The amount doesn't come off your tax, it is subtracted from your income before your tax is calculated.<br>  <br>  If you give cash, the amount of your donation is your deduction, assuming that you itemize.  Donations of cars have special rules.  The organization will give you a form telling you what they sold it for, and that's the amount of your donation.  So if for example you donated a car with blue book value $10,000, at auction they'd probably sell it for maybe $7000 if it's in very good condition, and that's all you could deduct, if you itemize so you can deduct it at all.  <br>  <br>  If you are in a 15% bracket, your tax benefit from a $7000 donation would be $1050 - that's how much less tax you'd have to pay if you have that much tax liability in the first place.  The savings is limited to the amount of your tax liability at most.<br>  <br>  If you donate a car because you want to help the charity, great.  If you're doing it for the tax deduction, you'd be way ahead to sell the car outright, then donate some of the sale price to the charity if you want to.|`|ug00j0S8aa	If you donated a car, the charity should send you a 1098-C describing the disposal of the vehicle.  They also will report it to the IRS if the amount is greater than $500.  Aside from that, there is the limit mentioned, plus remember that if you take the charitable deduction, you must itemize.  If you are not itemizing already, the tax benefit turns out to be even less.
63e4b2a381a37a2a4e488d966800a454aa	The amount is subject to your regular income tax rate plus a 10% early withdrawal  penalty on the full amount. The plan is supposed to withhold 20% for federal tax, but you are ultimately responsible for the state tax and the exact federal amount.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	First 10% will be taken for a tax penalty for the early withdrawal.  After that the percentage will depend on what tax bracket this additional income puts you into.  It could be 10, 15, 25, 28, 33, or 35%.  <br>  <br>  See page 271 of the IRS Pub 17 I have linked below.  It shows the 2008 Tax Rate Schedules.  This shows how much your taxable income will be taxed.  So the amount withdrawn could actually be partially taxed at one rate and the rest at the next higher.  Keep in mind your taxable income is all your income subject to tax for the tax year, minus any adjustments to your income, minus your standard deduction (or itemized deduction) and your personal exemptions.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line, the percentage is affected by many factors.  Also keep in mind that if you are in a taxing state, you will have state tax on top of the federal income tax.<br>  <br>  Laura H â H&R Block â Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided|`|8b0ff26bd768031b646ac62be8cba69aaa	Depends on the form of the withdrawal.  If it's a hardship withdrawal (you are still employed but take a hardship withdrawal of your own contributions) then the standard withholding is 10%.  However, you have the option of increasing or decreasing that amount.   <br>  <br>  If it's a full distribution (you are no longer employed with that company) then the standard withholding is 20%.  There is no changing that amount.  <br>  <br>  Withholding is different than taxes...they are simply pulling some money early so that you don't get hit with a huge tax bill come April and the govt can't get their money.  The withholding is treated no differently than your regular tax withholding from your paycheck...in fact it's added together to be input on exactly the same line.<br>  <br>  With almost every early distribution there is also a 10% early distribution tax.  This gets added to your regularly calculated tax.  After you add all you taxes up, you compare your withholding...if withholding is greater then taxes you get a refund of your withholding.  If withholding is less than your tax then you owe additional tax.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is 20% for total distribution or optional 10% for hardship withdrawals.|`|0uWqjL2raa	The amount withheld for an early distribution is 20% .

6LPeWXYuaa	You don't say where the property is located, and these prices may be typical of the homes of that area.  If that is the case, then maybe this is legit.<br>  <br>  That said, I am not aware of many places in the US where you can find a house that is of a decent size, and in a habitable condition for under $20,000.  Where I live, $20K won't cover the cost of the lot in most areas.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you find a local, experienced real estate agent to help you in your search.  As first time home buyers, you owe it to yourself to get someone to represent your interests in this transaction.  Your buyer's representative will be paid a commission from the seller's side, so the service is at no cost to you.<br>  <br>  Foreclosure properties may be a good deal, every property is different.  Some are in decent condition, and at a reasonable price.  Others are in bad condition, or at an inflated price.  Some have title issues that cannot be easily resolved, others have no issues that will jeopardize your transaction.  I have seen both sides of foreclosure properties. <br>  <br>  Before you go further, though, check with a lender and get pre-approved for a mortgage loan.  Without that you cannot submit an offer on a foreclosed property.  All companies/banks owners of REO properties require this to consider an offer to purchase.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  And remember the saying "If it looks too good to be true, it probably is."|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Foreclosures are not recommended for first time homebuyers. They are often in awful shape, due to the previous owner's neglect, due to sitting uninhabited for some time, and sometimes due to squatters damaging the house. This $16,000 house may need $100,000 or more to be livable. At the very least, you need to see the house and get it inspected by a home inspector of your choosing before you decide to buy it.<br>  <br>  I think what you should do instead of going for this is talking to a real estate agent about your budget, and see what is possible in your area.

OIU7tk2Jaa	OK, Princess...I think this is where they are going with this problem. First, you must understand that companies normally pay dividends every six months. So, with that basic piece of information in mind we see that $150,000 of paid-in capital was outstanding for the entire year. During the last 8 months of the same year an additional $40,000 of paid-in capital was issued. That means that dividends totaling  $12,000 ($150,000 x .08) were paid out on two different dates. Plus, since an additional $40,000 of paid-in capital was issued during the last 8 months of the year, an additional dividend of $1,600 reflecting this increase was added to the second payout bringing the TOTAL dividend payout for the year at $13,600 ($12,000 + $1,600). Remember, 8% is the ANNUAL RATE and must be converted to a six-month rate or 4% rate since the $40,000 of new capital was only outstanding during the last six month period. So, $40,000 x .04 = $1,600. The people who write these textbooks are a bunch of old foolers but they can't fool SlickyBoy! Remember also that dividends are only paid on capital that was outstanding for the WHOLE six-month period. For example, if the first dividend payment was to be made on June 1 and PERHAPS some new capital was paid-in in May of say, $10,000, that new capital would not be used in calculating the June 1 payment because it was not outstanding for the whole period.

9415fb4f621cd1718ee37afdf18253fdaa	There are many, many reasons, but it all boils down to this. Bank's loaned money to people for housing who could not afford the payments. Many of these "sub-prime" loans were made with little or no money down and a variable interest rate that is just now setting in at the adjusted rate. People bought into these loans for a couple of reasons. Reason 1: Remember when you thought you would NEVER need math? So did many people who took these loans. They were too ignorant to realize that they could not afford to pay them back, especially when the full payments kicked in. Reason 2: Many thought that since housing prices were booming that they could buy a house, live in it a couple of years, and sell for a big profit before the interest rates and payments went up - SURPRISE!!!!<br>  <br>  Banks rolled these loans into investment packages and sold them on the market. Mutual funds and investment firms invested imagining great returns because of the future interest rates. People bought into them - OUCH!!!<br>  <br>  All seemed well until the forecloses started which put a flood of houses on the market. Then prices fell making many houses worth much less than the loan value. You now have people who can't afford the houses going through foreclosure as well as many others who are better to go through foreclosures than lose money because they bought into an overpriced house. This effect snowballed and banks and investment firms started to go bankrupt. This caused stocks to drop and the economy then tanked last September. <br>  <br>  In a bad economy we spend less ( for many, too much credit card debt - that will be the next crisis). When we spend less there is less demand for products and so employers have to lay off. This starts another bad economic spiral.<br>  <br>  To sum it all up - bad planning and bad money management.|`|0rpS2b97aa	there are a lot of pieces to the puzzle.

The major reason is our elected representatives. Government mandates such as forcing banks to make loans to those who could not qualify. Banks are responsible because they put people in variable rate loans that they knew they could not afford when the varible rate went up. Instead of working with borrowers t get a fixed rate loan they could afford they foreclosed. This helped to burst an over inflated real estate market. Mortgage makers should never have been allowed to sell mortgages that they made. They got their money up front when the loan was made and then sold them to other lenders. It was basically paramount to a ponzie skeem. Final investors who planned on making a killing on these variable rate loans were left holding the bag when housing values dropped. Another thing that was a major contributor was the over inflated oil prices. People had difficulty paying their bills due to having to spend so much just to buy gas to get to work. Less expendable money resulted in less money to pay bills. I think the exhorbitant fuel prices did as much or more to bring this to a head than anything else. U.S. energy policy has also contributed to the current situation. Politicians and special interest groups have successfully lobbied against drilling in the U.S. This country would likely be able to be energy efficient if we stopped allowing these special interest groups to control our energy policy. OPEC and these energy producing countries have been draining our treasury for decades. Their greed helped to fuel this situaton. Much of the current problems could be followed back to the Carter administration and perhaps further back. When it comes to economic decisions we sometimes don't see the repurcussions or results of those decisions for a number of years. It boils down to greed. Greed by the banks. Greed by the oil producing countries. Greed by investors. We also need to look at ourselves. As a nation we have been overspending for many years. This has flowed up to the government. We have failed to take presonal responsibility for our own actions and we have also failed to hold our elected representatives responsible for their actions. Just recently congress gave themselves a big pay raise and $15,000 per month from the day they leave office, even after only one term. They did this when this country is in a depression. That is not only irresponsible but reeks of corruption and mismanagement of public funds. It is time to take personal responsibility for our own actions and hold our elected respresentatives accountable for their actions.|`|AA10590885	Once upon a time, long long ago, family's worked for the dream of owning their own home.  Only the males income could be considered - as unfair as this seems, the logic was that a woman could become pregnant at anytime and be unable to work and contribute to the household income.  When we got our equal rights that threw a whole crowd of families into the home buying market that  could not have afforded homes before - so prices went up (If I have 5 buyers for my home why not raise the price till I have only one or two).  Then the government stepped in and had lenders lower standards for loans. They stopped checking to see if the buyers really made as much money as they said. Again the house prices went up as the demand from first time home buyers increased.  Appraisers did not show actual home values - but the price that someone is willing to pay as the appraised value (think beanie babies - those $7 airport gift store items that started to resell for $2000?????).  Lenders made loans with balloon or adjustable rates that could not be made when the time came.

If she cancelled the claim for child benefit it probabily means that he didn't continue his education after he left compulsary school which means your no longer responsible to pay child support to him as he is no longer classed as an adult. If you ahve a private arrangement between you and her then i would seek out some legal help as she's taking the mick. If you pay through the CSA and they have set the amount etc, give them a ring and see what they say. I don't think you should be paying, especially if he's no longer in full time education.

I have a friend who is collecting support even though her children are nearing age 30 now and at the rate that the father is paying, she will still be collecting when her children are in their 50s.<br>  <br>  The support decree determines when support payments stop accruing.  Many decrees order them past age 18 if the child is a full time student, usually by requiring you to pay the child's school tuition and fees up through a certain age or the attainment of a bachelor's degree by the child.

Depending on how much more your mortgage payment is than the average rent in the area, you can possibly charge someone who doesn't qualify for a traditional loan a higher interest rate to get a little more for rent and can typically ask for a little higher price on something like a lease/ option. If you do a 2 or 3 year lease and  find potential tenants get with a broker to see if they have a possibility to get qualified in that time period to refinance and buy the house. Make sure you also try to help them in the next couple of years, you do want them to qualify and take the property off your hands. Do some homework.

They will take a detailed assessment of your attitude to risk, your investment timeframe, and what you are prepared to invest.  In my country (Australia) they are required to upgrade their qualifications every 3 years.<br>  <br>  If you are not happy with their advice, just go to another bank that offers the service and open an account there.  Then, use their financial planner for a second opinion.<br>  <br>  If you want totally unbiased advice, go to a financial planner where you pay an up front fee.  <br>  <br>  I also recommend that you head down to your local library and check out a few basic books on personal finance.  There are HEAPS at my local library, and I've probably read every one. You don't have to read the entire book, just go to the index and read the bits that you feel are most relevant to your situation.  Even just knowing a little bit might help you make your own decisions.<br>  <br>  I understand your qualms about going to someone since you had such a bad experience with the credit card counsellor.  <br>  <br>  Basically, the best advice I can give you is to minimize debt.  Rank all your debts on a sheet of paper from the highest interest rate to the lowest interest rate, regardless of the size of the loan.  Then, make minimum repayments on all the debts, but put any and all extra money you can on the loan with the highest interest rate.  That is the most cost effective way to get debt free.  It will save you the most interest and get you debt free sooner than any other mucking about with paying the smallest debt first, which is for losers.  <br>  <br>  When you have cleared the highest interest rate debt, move your 'payment' on that debt to the second highest interest rate debt.  Move down that line of debts until you are debt free.  I know, it feels pretty overwhelming right now, but you'll get there.  <br>  <br>  Doing this eliminates the need for debt consolidation.  Debt consolidation can actually be a real bad thing, as you've probably found out with your credit counsellor.  Not all your lenders will help you, and you also get big fees.  So do it this way.  <br>  <br>  I don't know what your current assets are, so my general advice is to reduce debt.  If you have any savings, I suggest you reserve 3 months living expenses at least for 'emergencies' like job loss, car repairs, medical or dental treatment, and put the rest on the loans.  <br>  <br>  When you are debt free, aim to live on 90% of your income and save the rest.  You can do this by having another bank account (preferably one that gets good interest) and having your employer transfer 10% of your wage into that special account on payday.  It makes it easy to save because you can't forget.  <br>  <br>  Minimize your living expenses while you are kicking this debt in the bum.  I take my lunch to work in microwaveable containers and nuke them in work's microwave.  I reuse all my leftovers like this.  I just make a big curry or a big pasta and freeze serves in the containers.  It saves me a fortune over buying my lunch.<br>  <br>  I also grow some of my own vegies.  I grow zucchinis and tomatoes and silverbeet and onions.  A lot of our meals come straight out of the garden.  It takes a little effort but it's worth it.<br>  <br>  Only buy generic brands where you can, and buy bigger 'bulk' packs of non perishable items.  I shop at factory sales outlets and get cheap canned food and cheap cakes of soap, which saves me a fortune over what I'd spend at the supermarket.  I also stock up on washing powder at Kmart when they have their 15% off sale.  I get a 12 kilogram box which saves me $3 a kilo over what I'd spend at the supermarket.  Little things like this help.<br>  <br>  Have shorter showers and you'll save on your water and energy bills.  I take 4 minute showers.  Use an egg timer or play a cd in the bathroom with a song that's only 4 minutes long.  Then you'll know how much time you've got.<br>  <br>  Plan car trips.  Shop for groceries or run errands on the way home.  Doing this saves fuel.  Also, inflate your tyres to their highest safe inflation.  It'll make for a rougher ride, but it'll use less fuel over time.  Also, remove roofracks where possible.  That saves fuel.<br>  <br>  I suggest you repost this question with more details.  What is your debt burden and your income?  Are you behind with payments? What country/ state do you live in? Someone might be able to give you really good advice for free.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|Saul1Bhuaa	I think you may need a team of two advisors:<br>  <br>  1.  CPA<br>  2.

B6EVKaFPaa	The first thing you need to decide is whether you're looking for a job or a business.<br>  <br>  There are several "jobs" out there but unless you manage to find a telecommuting job with a company, the jobs don't pay too well. Most of the work you do will be dependent upon what work is available. Jobs such as ChaCha, can be a lot of fun, but again--limited in the amount of money you can earn.<br>  <br>  A business can possibly have better income, but it all depends on you. The amount of income you earn will be dependent on you and not what work is available. Most of the companies will have a fee to pay for the starter kit. The cost can range. Some companies require inventory, so the starter kit is higher. I joined Scentsy and am having a great time with them. The starter kit for them was only $99.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to follow your passion. If you're doing something you love, then it is definitely worth it. Do your research and ask a lot of questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Lisa|`|sXkTRcx8aa	You may try this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://profitablemoneymakers.com" rel="nofollow">http://profitablemoneymakers.com</a>

dPLkNRNuaa	In general: <br>  <br>  It depends on what caused the tree to come down.<br>  <br>  It all comes down to negligence.<br>  <br>  In order to be paid for damage to your car by someone else....they have to have been negligent. And that negligence has to have been the reason you suffered damage to your car.<br>  <br>  If the tree he healthy....and a hurricane or ice storm causes the tree to fall on your car...the owner of the tree is not negligent. You are allowed to own a healthy tree. It is not negligence to own a healthy tree.  <br>  <br>  If the tree is sick, dead, dying....you as the property owner have a duty to take that tree down because it is a falling hazard.  By leaving a dead, dying, sick tree up....you are negligent. Now if that hurricane or ice storm causes the tree to fall...you may be responsible for anything it hits. <br>  <br>  Just owning a tree does not make you automatically responsible for it if it falls.  There are lots of other factors that come into play. <br>  <br>  If you as the renter....see a tree that is dead/dying/sick on the property that you rent.....you have a duty to notify the landlord of the hazardous condition.   <br>  <br>  So....if one of the trees that boarders the property is in poor condition....take a photo of the tree. Send a letter to the property owner.....certified mail....return receipt (and I'd enclose a copy of the tree) notifying them of the hazardous condition. Keep a copy for your records. <br>  <br>  In the mean time....make sure you have "full coverage"  (collision and comprehensive coverage) on your cars.  If the tree falls....it's going to be much easier to have your auto insurance pay for the damage to the car and then let them subrogate (go back against) the tree owner for recovery (if appropriate). <br>  <br>  <br>  **not legal advice|`|AA10045620	Your landlord's homeowner's insurance is responsible should damages occur for the trees coming down and damaging property.|`|rIzx4OEWaa	Hello Patricia,<br>  <br>  that would depend on who's land they are in? If you rent this property an have the rights to do the general gardening then it may fall un to you. But if the landlord employs a gardener to do the work then he is liable for any damage they cause. If in doubt ask the managing agents or get your lawyer to have a look at the contract which you have signed, or take it to an advice team like the citizen advice team it's what they are for. You must also be aware that the trees in question could also be protected an so you cannot just cut them down or hack off branches by heavy pruning as you will incur a very heavy fine for doing so, you would need to check with your local conservation officer about them. I hope this helps you as i have had to do similar things at rented property.|`|AA11012320	I don't understand what you mean by a tree coming down. trees are not in the habit of just falling down are they. so if you mean in a storm or high winds then no one would be liable, because it deemed an act of god. and if you parked your car by a tree line in a storm then if anything happened to your car it would be your own fault.<br>  <br>  PS. don't listen to those that say just cut them down these days even if there on your land you can be fined very heavily for doing such a thing without permission and I'm talking about a fine of thousands not just a few Hundred|`|5esm3e1Baa	Generally speaking, the landowner.

Subtract 1380 from the bank balance b/c the check is still outstanding, meaning the bank did not subtract the amount from our account.  Now we subtracted the amount from our records the day we wrote the check, so we need to subtract the amount from the bank balance in order for them to equal in the end.<br>  <br>  c. Subtract the $20 difference from our checkbook balance because we wrote the check for the correct amount, but recorded it in the check register for 20 less than what we should have recorded.  Therefore, our balance will be $20 too much if we dont subtract our error.<br>  <br>  d.  add 9000 to the checkbook balance b/c the bank collected money from someone we lent it to.  Then subtract $45 from the checkbook balance for th collection fee the bank charged.<br>  <br>  e.  Subtract $795 fro the checkbook balance becaue the customers check bounced, meaning they didnt have money in their account to cover the amount.  Since we recorded the amount of the check before we cashed it(assuming it wouldnt bounce), we added the amount to our balance.  Since it bounced, we now have to subtract the amount from our checkbook balance and also subtract $10 for a NSF fee charged by the bank.<br>  <br>  f.  Subtract $15 from our checkbook balance for normal bank service charges.<br>  <br>  g.  Add $10,152 to the bank balance because this is a deposit that the bank didnt record yet, but we recorded it in out checkbook, so it needs to be added to the bank balance to make the two equal.<br>  <br>        ---- After this, the adjusted balance for both sides should be $34,308<br>  <br>  Adjustments:  (only need to make adjustments for transactions that affected our checkbook balance)<br>   (Dr)=Debit, (Cr)=Credit<br>     <br>  1.

This would make the bank balance too high, because they already recorded the transaction.  This would also make our checkbook balance too low because we falsely added it to the wrong side.

PXMqXwflaa	Your purchase agreement with the contingency should spell out what will happen to the deposit if you can't negotiate an acceptable lease. Your agent should push the seller, and the person representing him, to sign the release. If he still refuses, there may be a clause in your contract that allows for you to still receive the money back without the signature of the seller.<br>  <br>  However, if there isn't a clause like this, check to see if there is language in the agreement that addresses what will happen to either party if one sues the other. In a normal purchase agreement, if the buyer (you) brings an action against the seller and wins, you will not only get your money back, but the seller may also have to pay court costs and pay for your attorney. You can also make a claim for any money you lost because of the actions of the seller.<br>  <br>  Talk to your agent, see if he can do anything for you, and ask him what your legal recourse is. Under no circumstances will you have to forfeit your deposit, if things are the way you described in your message.

If you lost your job and that is why you can't make your payments again talk to the bank about your situation and ask them if the will be willing to take the car back with out any additional charges to you.<br>  Your last choice would be to sell it for the balance of the loan at the minimum so that you wont have to pay the balance, if not then you will have to pay the rest to cover the balance of the loan on your own and before the bank signs the car over to the new owner.<br>  The bare minimum is to talk to the bank before the Rep the car, a car repossession will stay on your credit history for seven years and mess up your credit rating.

Is your library open today ... Sunday? Don't wait to get started. If making money is truly a goal, get started TODAY.<br>  <br>  Speaking of goals, it's important to write down exactly how much you want to make and in what time frame. Are you looking simply for vacation money or would you like to get a car at 16, go to college at 18, and buy a home or get an apartment at 24, 30 or 45??? You may think that's pushing things a little but how can you reach a goal if you haven't set it???<br>  <br>  You can consider your own business... yup, even at your age. Your parents can help you and it may be possible for you to pay your parents an allowance. How's that for freedom???<br>  <br>  Seriously think about a few things: what are your skills, interests and experiences? what do you enjoy doing or selling? what do your potential customers want or need??? Think about selling products (games, books, toys, tshirts, whatever), writing or teaching things that you know, designing websites for small businesses, setting up computers for new buyers, hosting puppet shows, housekeeping, yard work, washing windows, washing cars, creating comic books, or recycling cans in your community.<br>  <br>  You have so many options but none of us can tell you what's right for you. You'll make more money working for yourself than you will working for an employer because you can keep 100% of the profits after your taxes and expenses are paid. Look into a legal business with licenses, tax ids, etc. <br>  <br>  Want some real life experiences? Check out junior achievements at the link below:

Because most wait six months to charge off a debt, that winds up being seven years and six months after the first delinquency.  The clock starts when the original account goes into collections (internal or a third party) or is charged off  (which ever is earlier), according to the FDCPA.  Even if the debt is sold and resold to third party collectors, it still has to come off your credit report when the original debt reaches itâs expiration date."<br>  <br>  This is as written under Running of Reporting Period - Section 605 [15 U.S.C.

CkecSp4Uaa	Um, no.  It's a government regulation to prevent supermarkets and grocery stores from selling food that is old enough that there is a significant increase in the risk of contracting food poisoning from it.  Food that is close to or past the use by date does not taste as good and has a much higher chance of being contaminated by bacteria.  If the food is past it's use by date the supermarket HAS to throw it away...which means they are throwing money away.  They can not legally sell it.  Which is why stores actually reduce the price of products that are approaching their use by date (generally by 10-20%)...it's an attempt to get rid of it before they loose money on it.  I have no idea where you came up with the theory that the stores somehow make money by putting use by dates on their products.  It's not like normal people look at the use by date and say "oh, this is about to go bad I should buy it NOW even though I don't really need it."  They look at the use by date and say "oh, this is about to go bad, I need to buy a different one," and then they leave the one that is near it's expiration date sitting on the shelf for the supermarket to throw away (or for someone who isn't paying attention to the use by date to purchase it).|`|EqxlW39Jaa	You are crazy. You probably think the government blew up the twin towers. Conspirasy theorists have no common sense. WHY WOULD THE STORES DO THAT TO SELL THINGS FASTER??? They put expiration dates on things because of government regulations because they don'e want people to get sick. But sure, eat all the old food you want. You may or may not get sick, it is a gamble. Why don't you test your conspiracy theory to see if it is real?

Anyway, it said that you send only $1.00 to each of the 6 email addresses stated in this article.<br>  <br>  You then place your name and address at the bottom of the list at the # 6th position and email it to your friends as well as post this message (with your email address in the list) to at least 200 newsgroups.<br>  <br>  (There are thousands)<br>  <br>  So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I figured "what have I got to lose except <br>  <br>  $6.00, right?"<br>  <br>  So I invested the measly $6.00<br>  <br>  Well GUESS WHAT!!<br>  <br>  Within days, I started getting money coming into my Pay Pal account!<br>  <br>  I was shocked!<br>  <br>  I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in.<br>  <br>  In my first week, I made about $25.00, which means that 25 people joined the group after they saw my posted messages.<br>  <br>  By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1000.00!<br>  <br>  In the third week I had over $10,000.00 and it's still growing.<br>  <br>  This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly.<br>  <br>  It's certainly worth $6.00, and the few minutes it took to join Paypal.<br>  <br>  I have spent more than that on the lottery!<br>  <br>  Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works.

72855b2f041d5bc5955f68321972de1eaa	I would suggest Scottrade. UNLIKE etrade and other brokers you dont need to trade a minimum of stocks per quarter to avoid any fees! So you can buy low, forget about them, and sell high later whenever your ready as their aren't any maintenance fees. Other sites also require a large deposit that has to be wired from your bank account.<br>  With Scottrade there are many local branches that you can sit down with a person open an account and drop off a check (min $500) making it alot safer and cheaper if your new to the market. And if their are any problems their just a 10min drive away.<br>  And forget about e-trades $10+ per trade. At Scott's $7 bucks a trade is solid.<br>  Don't wanna pay $7 use this code when opening account... <br>  ReferALL code: RWFQ4282 <br>  Referred by: Martin Michael Niessen <br>  You get your 1st 3 trades for free And if you refer anyone else you get 3 more for free. YOU CAN'T get any lower than FREE.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you will be very satisfied with Scottrades No Hidden Inactive or Maintainence Fees, their Customer Service, Cheap Trades, and Ease of use.<br>  <br>  Check out their Reasons at <a href="http://www.scottrade.com/online_trading_..." rel="nofollow">http://www.scottrade.com/online_trading_...</a><br>  <br>  Have anymore questions feel free to email me at jackoblades6@yahoo.com Or even better you can call a branch or chat online with a representative.|`|vqdurAA5aa	The lowest, as far as I know, is Interactive Brokers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/accounts/fees/commission.php?ib_entity=llc" rel="nofollow">http://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/acc...</a><br>  <br>  Certainly there are a lot of brokerages that have accounts with no commissions for stock trading, but they will collect other fees.

qBCGH52haa	No...with one exception on the $7,500 tax credit (which was eliminated in the $8,000 tax credit), the method of financing is irrelevant.  As long as you closed on the house during the required time frame and had not owned a house in the past three years, you qualified for the tax credit.
96d31f2eb78b0da781f956843c10646baa	A contract of employment does not necessarily have to be written (express terms).<br>  <br>  The very act of turning up to work at a specific time/place, carrying out specific duties, accepting payment for said work etc. forms a contract of employment (implied terms).<br>  <br>  It therefore seems that the "member of staff" is as likely to face disciplinary proceedings as any other member of staff.<br>  <br>  For further information follow this link: <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.acas.org.uk</a>|`|RD7A4NAtaa	There would be a lot of factors to take into account when thinking about disciplinary action.<br>  How long have they worked there, what rules have they broken, even though there is no signed contract, di they enter a verbal contract... etc.<br>  <br>  If they were aware of the rules before the 'incident', then you could say there are grounds for disciplinary action, but I would be very careful doing it!<br>  <br>  The other way of doing it would be to just fire them (if the 'incident' were serious enough).

QoVL5cDHaa	I don't know where that myth comes from, but it often crops up on here. However many jobs you have, you don't pay Higher Rate (40%) until your income goes above ï¿¡40,835 a year. It is hardly likely you will work enough hours at a second job to put you into this bracket, so you will probably lose 20% (1/5) of your second job earnings in tax. You can earn ï¿¡105 at second job before you have to pay National Insurance. After that, you lose 11% of excess.<br>  These figures go up on 6th April, the start of the new tax year.

Ply6KVZDaa	The benefits are, as previously stated, the paperwork.  If you have ever seen how many papers need to be filled out you would understand.  Also the agent had access to many more listings than you can find on the internet and newspaper.  Another pro is the fact that they can negotiate better on your behalf.  Unless you are in the real estate business and know the in's and outs already, it is always better to have someone who knows those extra details that can get you a better deal.  The main thing you need to do is find the agent that is right for you.  The first one you come in contact with doesn't have to be the one you work with.|`|nQPcbjLKaa	They can sell it quicker, and if you're specific, they can help you find what you're looking for faster.

IKakoOfyaa	From the American Express gift card FAQ:<br>  <br>  Does my Gift Card have an expiration date?<br>  No. While there is "valid thru" date indicated on the front of the Gift Card, the Available Funds on the Gift Card do not expire but may be reduced by service fees as described in the question above. The "valid thru" date is simply required to ensure that the Gift Card can be used at Merchants that request and/or require customers to provide a plastic expiration date during the transaction process. You may not use the Gift Card after the "valid thru" date. If Available Funds remain on the Gift Card after the "valid thru" date, contact us at the Customer Service Number to obtain a replacement Gift Card or for instructions on how to redeem the Available Funds. We will issue you a replacement Gift Card free of charge if your "valid-thru" date expires. If you ask us to issue you a check for the amount of any Available Funds remaining on the Gift Card after the "valid thru" date, we may hold the Available Funds for ten (10) business days after you request a check to ensure that all transactions have posted to our system. We reserve the right to decline to issue a replacement Gift Card.<br>  <br>  The rest of the FAQ is here:  <a href="https://www212.americanexpress.com/dsmlive/dsm/dom/us/en/personal/cardmember/additionalproductsandservices/giftcardsandtravelerscheques/amexgiftcardfaqs.do?vgnextoid=40b9e6e93492a110VgnVCM200000d0faad94RCRD&vgnextchannel=95ddb81e8482a110VgnVCM100000defaad94RCRD#4" rel="nofollow">https://www212.americanexpress.com/dsmli...</a>

kGJND4lYaa	St N's answer seems to be based on US taxes. Shame shame.<br>  <br>  In Canada, sole-proprietorship income losses CAN absolutely offset your non-business income. If you have more losses than total income for 2008, you can elect to carry forward or back the loss (Form T1A, Request for Loss Carryback).<br>  <br>  See p.29, "Line 9946" in the Business and Professional Income guide (T4002)<br>  <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/t4002/README.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/t4002/...</a><br>  <br>  You will report the rental income and expenses (mortgage income, Capital Cost Allowance on part of the house) on Form T2125, Statement of Business or Professional Activities<br>  <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/slprtnr/rprtng/menu-eng.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/s...</a><br>  <br>  You will also pay CPP contributions on any profit from business on Schedule 8.<br>  <br>  Here's the MOST IMPORTANT news: If this house was your principal residence, you will be deemed to have sold the PART OF IT you are renting (based on area) at fair market value on the first day you received rent for any part of it, then you will be deemed to have reacquired it for the same fair market value. This will trigger a capital gain or loss and possible capital gains tax.<br>  <br>  See Paragraph 30 of the Interpretation Bulletin:<br>  <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it120r6/it120r6-e.html#P200_51963" rel="nofollow">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it120r...</a><br>  <br>  Note: None of the above is optional. It is all triggered by the rental of the one room.|`|fbd64694a498c73d8b0c3ca90c37602aaa	You have to declare the income from the rental room and then you can apply expenses against this income.  The mortgage interest is one of those expenses, but you will have to prorate everything.  If it was a 6 room house, not counting bathrooms, and there were 3 bedrooms in those 6, then you could claim 1/6 of the utilities and interest as expenses against the income.  These deductions might eliminate the business income by giving you a loss, but the loss can only be applied against business income so will be of no value on your personal income tax.
6LPeWXYuaa	If you're a REALTOR, you might want to check with your local board to see what the attrition rate is now for your area.  Also check your closed sales to active/pending listing stats for the areas you want to work.<br>  <br>  It is possible that now is a good time to start out in real estate.  If you have enough money to carry you for at least 6 months, you could start to build your business and be ready when the market starts an upswing.<br>  <br>  If you must start earning immediately, it might be wiser to either partner up with an established real estate team or get a *day job* for right now.  As you know, there are expenses to be a real estate agent even if you do not generate any income.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Therefore, as long as his name isn't on the deed you have the right to evict him.  Just find out how many days notice you need to give. More than likely it's 30.

Bw1h5xAcaa	You would still need to go through a nursing program. No matter what state you live in, you must graduate from an accredited school of nursing in order to be licensed. <br>  <br>  If you have completed your bachelor's degree in alternative medicine, you could look for a program referred to as an "Accelerated BSN" or "post baccalaureate BSN" for people like you, who hold another degree. If you do not finish the other degree, you'll just need to go into a regular nursing program (preferably BSN but you could do a two-year Assoc. Degree in Nursing program if you wanted).<br>  <br>  If you have completed those science pre-reqs (biology, chemistry, A&P, microbiology, etc.) within the last 5-7 years then the nursing programs will accept the transfers but if it's been longer than that most schools will make you retake the courses, or some offer a "test-out" option where you can take a version of the final exam for the course. <br>  <br>  Then the nursing core courses themselves will take you about 18-24 months, depending on what program you go through. The accelerated BSN programs can often be completed in 18 months.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	where?<br>  <br>  in the US, nursing is controlled by the licensing board of each individual state.  you'll find the minimum requirements on that board's website under your state's general website.
kGJND4lYaa	That is correct. The table on p.39 Pub 970 lays out the different cases. If you are eligible to claim her and she paid for the tuition, no one can claim the deduction.<br>  <br>  Note that if she did not live with you (i.e. lived at college) for more than half of 2008, and she had gross income of more than $3500, she does NOT qualify to be your dependent, and therefore can claim the deduction herself.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Since you can claim her as a dependent, YOU can claim the credit or deduction even though SHE paid it from her funds.  This is one of those odd cases where the person paying the expense does not necessarily get the tax benefit.  <br>  <br>  The reverse to this situation is also true.  A child that cannot be claimed as a dependent and whose tuition & fees are paid by a parent gets to take the credit or deduction even though the parent paid them.
DAMZKbpDaa	The purpose of taxation in general is for the government to raise money.<br>  <br>  The federal income tax, the way it is set up, also tries to achieve "social goals," such as taxing the rich more, preventing wealth transfer (gift/inheritance tax), rewarding certain behaviors (EIC, child tax credit, hybrid car credit, long etc.).<br>  <br>  All taxes are ultimately paid by "people." Taxing business firms passes the tax along in higher prices to the "people" who buy it. For example, if congress started a "carbon tax," taxing carbon use in such things a coal and oil for utilities, the utilities would offset the extra expense in higher utilities bills, and the people would pay for the carbon tax in higher utilities bills.|`|AA10792562	This is how the government gets the money it needs to run.<br>  <br>  If you think the government supplying schools, roads, etc. is a good thing, then the governmetn needs money to pay for them.|`|qBCGH52haa	The primary purpose of taxes is to fund government activities.  Technically, we could tax only businesses, but then, one of two things would happen - either the businesses would raise prices to cover the cost of the taxes, meaning people end up paying anyway, or businesses would lower wages to cover the cost of taxes, meaning people would still have lower income.  Regardless of where the money comes from, people end up paying the taxes anyway.|`|AA10469473	Taxes provide money for the government to operate and to provide government services.<br>  <br>  Taxes on business become part of the cost charged for their products.  For example, if all of the taxes were paid by the oil companies, the price of gas would go through the roof.  If the government said they could charge extra for the extra costs, there would be major gas shortages since the companies wouldn't produce gas if they were going to lose money on it.

OacSIfSiaa	Anyone can rebuild their credit.  It just takes time.<br>  <br>  Even if one pays off all their debt, this does not mean your score will jump up into the 800's.  It will rise but you must establish a good record of on time payments over at least a 2 year period.<br>  <br>  As long as you have had no judgments on your credit report, once those debts are paid, your score will rise because your debt utilization will be 0% which is good.  But remember this, credit scores are based on history and not just how much you owe.<br>  <br>  A person can owe $500,000 on a home but as long as they pay their mortgage on time their score will rise or remain constant.<br>  <br>  Once you get back on tract, keep those credit card balances under 30% of your total credit line and pay more then the minimum and your score will go up in a while.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question.|`|XxsfH3yzaa	Ð¡redit repair workÐµd fine to fix my credit.

PvCngXKIaa	You don't have a "safety net" per se but all might not be lost.  You have at least two options that in a contested situation might not win you the house but could result in recovered investment.  One would be a written agreement between you and the "legal owner" (your boyfriend) stipulating a payment of X dollars to you should your relationship terminate before some predetermined time.  A second would be established if your relationship developed to the point of being recognized as a "common law marriage."  Of course this option would be subject to the laws of your state.  A third option, if you could swing it, would be to have your BF sign a promissory note for the initial money you invest in the house.  In every case you would be wise to seek the advice of an attorney before you jump into the relationship you describe.  Although the legal advice will not be free, going this route could wind up saving you thousands of dollars in the long run.|`|6LPeWXYuaa	I think you are wise to think of this ahead of time.  You probably should consult with a legal adviser to see what recourse you may have and what you might do to protect yourself.<br>  <br>  Of course, there is no way to know what will happen in 10 years.  Laws can change.  But, you can do what is possible now.<br>  <br>  You may be advised to keep an accounting of your financial investment and also your "sweat equity" investment in a property you co-habitate with a life partner.  In the event that your relationship ends, you may be able to show that you contributed far more than a market value rent that you would have paid to a LL during the time you lived in the property.<br>  <br>  Of course, since the property would not be in your name, you would probably be free to walk away with no legal consequence, unlike your BF who would have financial responsibility to the mortgage holder.<br>  <br>  There may be the possibility of common law marriage rights assumed if you live together as a couple and have joint accounts, etc.  Again, check with a legal adviser.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|3yrpDNavaa	The ONLY guaranteed safety net for you is to own the home as a joint tenant or tenant in common.  In other words, you MUST be listed as co-owner on the deed.  Anything else, e.g. a separate written agreement between you and bf, or common law marriage, or whatever, would be speculative at best.  Also, anything else would put the burden on YOU to prove you are entitled to anything!  If the home is jointly titled in your name, then there is nothing for you to prove.|`|04Te5gzzaa	Not sure what the rules are in Canada but in the U.S., once the deed is issued under his name, he can amend if for a fee at the county registrar to have both your name and his name on the deed.  Then it doesn't matter who the mortgage is under, the deed for the property is under both your names so he can't stiff you if you guys break up and he decided not to give you your share of the house or vice versa.|`|eNulfbs7aa	You don't have a safety net....he can qualify for everything and still put you on the actual deed or whatever it is called in canada.  <br>  If you are not on there...you could lose EVERYTHING!  Get married and it is a different story...otherwise...I would NOT do it!|`|6DPBX2P2aa	Agree on the split percentage should the relationship don't work out and have a lawyer draft out the agreement.|`|RQvLrKMXaa	I don't think that it matters where you live, buying a house with a bf and your name on nothing is risky business.  If and when the two of you decide to go separate ways, you've lost everything.|`|kRO55DHyaa	The two of you need to see a lawyer for help in drawing up the terms of this purchase if your name is not to be on the title.  You can preserve your rights to a portion of the home, but I would enforce those rights BEFORE you close on the home.  If you don't do so, I would guess you would have a 1%-5% chance of seeing any of your money back out of the house should you two split.

With the economy many are cutting costs as much as possible which will likely have an effect on the number of workers needed to man those call centers. Another area that is effected is in computer software. There are many software developers who are using Indian programmers to develop software, again for the lower labor costs. If software companies are not selling as much of their software then they don't need to continue paying people to develop more software.

874e9ed8d38f4753f6cca93e708cd95baa	I do three different savings methods.  One is the savings account, the fund I'd use if I were to be unemployed, and I try to put about 10% of my weekly income into that.  Once it gets enough money into there, I'll be putting that money into CDs, which are higher interest but can't be taken out of the bank so easily as a savings account could be.  The second is a 10 dollar a week checking account to be used only for frivolous expenditures, like the movies, entertainment, etc.  The third is my Simple Ira, for retirement, which my employer matches up to 3% of my weekly income.  Split up your money into several accounts and for some reason you save more than if it's all in one place.|`|6DPBX2P2aa	I save 60% of my total income.

AA10779574	In an uncertain environment such as you describe (and as Andy Grove from Intel labled), the current fad is to pick "simple" strategies and stick by them instead of conventional strategies such as low cost, differentiation or focus.<br>    Simple strategies include things like acquisition of certain types of firms, leading in specific ares of research & innovation. Committing to specific categories of ventures to establish new markets in foreign countries. <br>    Grove's idea of keeping yourself paranoid was to keep the assumption that your advantage in an area is temporary, so if you have a great technology, assume it will be dead in six months.
