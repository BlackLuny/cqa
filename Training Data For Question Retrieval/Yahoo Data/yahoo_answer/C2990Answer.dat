AA10101610	Perhaps the answer you seek is just this...Global Warming is an issue that was CREATED to express a concern with the overall amount of toxic by products that man produces on a daily basis. What makes it such a hot bed is that science can be manipulated to prove each theory with no room for doubt...or so it would seem.  As both a former science and history teacher I can tell you that despite the increase in the worlds population we now produce LESS toxic gasses today than we did a hundred fifty years ago. Point of FACT that most of the worlds cities were so polluted a hundred fifty years ago the sun very rarely was able to reach the cities streets. Massive coal and wood burning in conjunction with unrestricted disposal of all waste materials both human and industrial caused a lot more pollution than we can imagine today.  As for your question just ask yourself if some rich guy comes up and offers to sell you an umbrella to keep the sun off of you or one that keeps the rain off of you which would you buy?  The answer is neither because you already have one and it is good for both sun and rain.  Common sense says there is some truth in both sides of the equation but that a lot of that truth is being misused for personal gain rather than for mankind as a whole.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	You're on the Right Track!  :)  The fact IS; WE are Responsible for "Global Warming..." -because WE have created it by our Increasing numbers & mass polluting ways...-and there's NOTHING "Natural" about it!

Carbon-dioxide, aka CO2 is an odorless tasteless gas, which makes up a little over a third of one percent of the air.  All plants breathe it, without CO2 they would die, and shortly thereafter so would we.  It is a vital gas and it is a trace gas.  It has risen slightly in the last 55 years (prior to that we weren't measuring it with modern tools).  We don't know if this is a normal deviation or not.  Temperature fell, rose, and is now falling again.  Somehow the CO2 has been conflated to be the cause, mostly as the results of a campaign by one man who stands to profit handsomely if enough people can believe him.    Carbon particulate matter is another thing.  That's a fancy term for soot, which is thrown off in great abundance by industrial processes and power generation especially those that use coal.  It can be combated by filters and scrubbers on the smoke stacks.  Most of the western world does this. Large swaths of Asia, especially China have yet to adopt these technologies.  For the sake of the health of their people hopefully that is soon to come.    Don't worry about this global warming thing.  It's a spook story.  Worry about real problems, like soil degradation or fresh water supplies.|`|fpUx07Dzaa	Hi there again cattitude. Your question is a bit loaded and I'm sure you will get a lot of fiery answers from both sides on this one.     The main thing to realize is the question of whether or not it is man-made is quite important for the very reason that it would not necessarily be a good thing to reduce carbon if it were natural. Carbon dioxide itself is not toxic, and I believe the maximum "safe" carbon dioxide concentration allowable by law for an occupied building is something like 5000 ppm--much greater than the 385 ppm we are currently at. So reducing emissions just for the sake of health is not really a good argument.     What you have to consider is reducing carbon would necessarily mean spending money on something to replace it--we cannot simply go without energy--and the estimates of how much it would actually cost to replace it range from trillions of dollars on either side of 0. That is, some say significant carbon reductions would destroy our economy, while others say it would foster new investments and create new jobs, thus boosting economic growth tremendously. I am not an expert on the economy so I'll leave that open for someone else.     The good news is, it is far from a 50/50 gamble. 3+ decades of research on the climate system, in addition to unprecedented worldwide collaboration from thousands of scientists from 100+ countries has determined with near 90% certainty (IPCC 4th report) that global warming is indeed caused by man. Furthermore, there have been numerous studies examining the economic devastation associated with the effects of future global warming and climate change, and none of them look pretty. A common range is between 5-20 percent of global GDP to combat the effects of GW and CC, due to increasing storms, droughts/floods (in different places, of course), melting glaciers, sea level rise, increased disease, less agricultural productivity...etc.     5-20% GDP is extraordinarily high, especially considering that most estimates of the costs to combat dangerous warming lie somewhere in the range of 1-2%--or about what the world spends annually on advertising.|`|AA11105711	Well yes and no.  If you are just talking about CO2, it is not toxic and will not harm you in any way.  However, there are a lot of other chemicals coming out of a car exhaust that are not good for you.  These chemicals have been reduced significantly by catalytic converters in cars but not completely.  So if you go by the assumption that climate change is not man made reducing carbon really has no benefit, which is the argument most deniers have.  Reducing other pollutants is something everybody can agree upon.    However I look at it from a different angle.  Even if we can't be 100% sure (we never can) that increased CO2 is warming the earth, doesn't it make sense to try to do something about before we pass the point of no return?

I'd personally like to take a horse and buggy to work.|`|0KmJwYunaa	Gasoline and Diesel    Just not from fossil sources.   Sandia Labs has already synthesized liquid fuels from CO2 and H2O with solar power.     The actual synthesis of iso-octane and iso-decane has been well known since 1923.   It's called the Fischer Tropsch reaction and it involves putting H2 and CO with some iron cobalt catalysts at 300C under 10 to 60 bars of pressure to produce synthetic gasoline, at 180C, it produces synthetic diesel.   The H2 and CO, otherwise known as syngas can be produced in a number of fashions, from CO2 and H2O with the help of a source of power like solar, wind, or nuclear.   It can be produced by gasification of coal which is how WWII Germany and embargoed South Africa fueled themselves.   It can be produced from natural gas at remote sites and since remote wells flare off the natural gas due to the expense of bringing it to market, using "stranded" natural gas is considered carbon neutral as it was just going to be burnt anyways (150 million cubic meters are flared every year).   And it can be produced by gasification of biomass (partial burningg of garbage).   The DoD has contracted with Diversified Energy and Velocys to produce mobile biomass gasifiers and FT reactors to produce diesel and jet fuel from a military camp's garbage.   Biomass gasification is considered marginally carbon negative since some carbon is sequestered in the ash hence synthetic fuels from biomass gasification is the only alternate fuel that can claim to be carbon negative.    There are newer more efficient methods being explored which should produce gasoline at $35 per barrel ( $0.88 per gallon).    Lithium Ion batteries have an energy density of 250 WH/l by volume and 350 WH/kg by mass, compressed H2 at 147 atmospheres has an energy density of 405 WH/l whereas gasoline has an energy density of 9,000 WH/l by volume, 13,500 WH/kg.   Although electricity has it's place, it really isn't up to replacing gasoline completely by two orders of magnitude and hydrogen is pretty much a joke.    The best alternatives to gasoline and diesel is gasoline and diesel from biomass gasification hence sequestering carbon.    If you expect people to just throw away their existing gasoline cars for freshly manufactured electrics, you're releasing a huge amount of carbon into the atmosphere in that the manufacture of the materials and the new vehicle requires energy and produces CO2.   It's doubtful that an EV can ever amortize that carbon footprint.   However if you produce synthetic fuels by carbon-negative means, there will be no increase in the manufacturing of new vehicles over the current rate and some carbon will actually be sequestered.|`|FR0manFQaa	definitly electric here is a couple examples of a car making headroom for more electric cars, the cityzenn in fall will go 200 miles on one five minute charge on a standard outlet with a top speed 80 mph|`|z95FZsgAaa	10 years?

By that theory, all you have to do is add fertilizer and growth will increase but not CO2 because that would be good and you want to make CO2 entirely negative for propaganda purposes.  The biggest problem plants have in most places is water and more CO2 reduces the plants need for water as well.  Nitrogen is only limited in bogs and places like that.  It is not generally the limiting factor that restricts plant growth.    Iron is more commonly the nutrient lacking in the ocean.  Where do you get the notion that it is phosphorus.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	No.  There have already been several examples of the effects of increased CO2 causing a decrease in vegetation.  For example, dying western US forests:  http://climateprogress.org/2009/01/23/sc...    Some people argue plants will benefit from increased CO2.  That would be true if the CO2 increase didn't also cause heat waves droughts, and desertification.  http://climateprogress.org/2009/01/26/no...    Like the argument 'warmer is better', the argument 'plants benefit from increased CO2' is very one-dimensional thinking.|`|AA11105711	Maybe a little, it will affect different plants differently.

C6WloQoaaa	good question.      i think parts of california are more prone to water shortages than others.  the sierras melt a good deal of snow each year- that probably is routed to aqueducts which flow throughout the central valley.      The Colorado river water flowing out of Lake Meade in Nevada is hurting more and more each year, but I think that's more of a threat to Pheonix and Vegas.      Here's a good angle:     If global warming increases the desertification of the already arid regions of California, then natural reservoirs and ground water supplies will become insufficient for the current water demands.    so appropriate actions might be:    1. lessen the demand for water (water efficient shower-heads and toilets, compost toilets, drip-line irrigation, stop car washes, etc.)  2. import water  (washington sure gets alot of rain, maybe they'd trade water for batteries charged by california's solar-panel farms)  3. hope for tech breakthroughs (coastal fog catchers, ocean-water desalinizers, waste water recycleries)  4.

In the UK the British Horse Society estimates that there are 3,000 horse related accidents each year. Every day, there are eight horse-related accidents on Britain's roads,     Horses are unpredictable and sadly many road users do not take this into consideration, it has become almost impossible to find safe places to ride to teach young or nervous horses how to become confident on the roads. No horse rider will ride on the road out of choice. It is never a pleasant experience and some drivers show a lack of consideration that borders on the dangerous. This is largely the result of ignorance. Drivers do not understand that even the steadiest of horses can suddenly take fright and shy out into the road. To have a car go past at 40 mph with inches to spare can be a very unnerving experience for both horse and rider. It seems more people drive aggressively and impatiently behaving badly when they have to slow down and for many riders like myself the benefits no longer outweigh the risks. Unlike a car we cannot just get our horses resprayed and dents knocked out and we care too much for them and others who might be injured to take the risk.|`|0c8GH6zwaa	first of all, horses are SLOW and EXPENSIVE, thats the whole reason why we stopped using them..... they also get old and tired.

Horses have the problem that they need to eat. Feeding horses both costs money and requires large tracts of land. With the human population as it is we're having trouble feeding ourselves. Horses also poop. Back in the heyday of horses there could actually be streets ankle-deep in poop. Also, the poop would dry out and get kicked into the air and cause respiratory disease. Another problem with horses is that they die. Cities actually had to contend with the removal of thousands of dead horses per day.    No, the green solution to our transport woes will not be horses. The solution will be cities that are designed so that most trips can be made on foot if short and bike if longer. For longer distances and bad weather public transit will be the fallback. Extreme distances will be done by train or coach and only in very rare cases will we need cars (and they'll be wind or solar generated electric or hydrogen).|`|uRh1xCf8aa	Hulk green.

Conserve Water (take more baths than showers and turn the water off when you brush your teeth.)  4.) Keep all lights/ tvs/ computers off as much as you can  5.) Unplug things that are not often in use (for example, I have a lamp that rarely is ever turned on- unplug it even if it is off and you will still save a lot of energy)  6.) Walk more (it uses less gas and is healthy for you!)  7.) Keep the car tuned off when you are waiting to pick someone up   8.) Avoid very fumy items (like nail polish dryers, but don't worry they won't kill the world!)  9.) Only water your grass a little (it's ok to not have a perfect lawn- honestly, all that happens is it dries out again and dogs pee on it)  10.)

Luckily, fun, accessible information on green thinking, environmentalism and sustainable living is everywhere these days. Why not start with online sources like our very own guide for How to Go Green. Other websites like Grist, Ideal Bite or Worldchanging also offer great advice and different perspectives. If you prefer the print media, check out magazines like Plenty, Good, or UTNE http://www.utne.com/. And if youre not much of a reader, documentaries like An Inconvenient Truth, Who Killed the Electric Car?, or the BBCs Planet Earth are also a good place to start.      Transport  Having got a little reading under your belt, youre probably itching to get started. One of the biggest impacts we have on the planet is a direct result of the way we move ourselves around. Fortunately, for many of us, this is also easy to do something about. You might consider walking, biking or using mass transit, at least a few days a week. Maybe you can convince your boss to let you work from home? Maybe you can carpool with a friend? If nothing else, you should certainly consider fuel consumption as a major factor in your choice of next vehicle. And when it comes to longer trips, flying is notoriously carbon intensive  so let the train take the strain wherever possible. Find a greener route from A to B with How to Green Your Car, and our Cars and Transportation section.      Energy  With all the talk of solar panels, fuel cells, building-integrated wind turbines, and flux capacitors, it can be easy to think you need a million bucks to go green at home. Not so. Many of the most effective ways to cut carbon emissions are also the cheapest. Turn lights off when you go out, install energy efficient bulbs and appliances, insulate your home, and keep an eye on consumption. Once youve done all that, why not investigate if you can buy green energy from your local utility? Check out our guides on How to Green Your Heating and How to Green Your Electricity for a more detailed plunge.      Water  This is where the folks in Seattle or the UK start switching off, but stay with us, please! Even if you live in areas of abundant rainfall, water is still a major ecological issue. Clean, drinkable water is precious and needs to be used most efficiently. Every drop of tap water we use also requires energy to filter, purify and transport, and that means fossil fuel emissions. And for those of you in dryer areas, you know only too well that water is becoming an ever-scarcer resource. Fortunately its pretty easy to do something aboutinstall water-saving shower heads and aerators, turn the tap off when youre brushing your teeth, switch to more efficient appliances, or collect rainwater for use in the garden. All this and more can be found in our guide, How to Green Your Water. For those wanting to go a little more hardcore, the Navy Shower, or the "selective flush" are worth a tryif the comments on these posts are anything to go by, youll be in good company!      Food  Weve all got to eat, and most of us do it every day. It stands to reason that our collective food choices have a huge impact on the planet, and with the global food industry shipping products further and further around the world, and with farming becoming ever more intensive, this impact is only getting bigger. Fortunately, there is a resistance underway. More and more people are getting interested in sustainable food systems. To bring it back to basics, there are four principles that can help guide you to greener meals: eat local, eat seasonal, eat organic, and finally, eat less meat. For a comprehensive guide to a more sustainable diet, check out How to Green Your Meals and the Food and Health category.      Waste  Not so many years ago, waste was THE environmental issue. If you recycled, you were green. If you didnt, you werent. With so many topics on the environmental agenda these days, things arent so simple. But waste is still a big deal. Every item thrown away has taken energy and resources to manufacture and transport, and it will take even more energy and resources to process and dispose of, whether through landfill or recycling. So the old adage still rings true: reduce, reuse, recycle. And dont forget to compost! Of course we have a guide on How to Green Your Recycling, and you can find it here. Online resources like Freecycle or Ebay can also help you find a happy home your unwanted goods.      Threads  Most folks understand that food, energy, water, and transport are major environmental factors, but what about clothing? Even consumers who always eat organic may happily be wearing garments that were liberally sprayed with noxious chemicals. Cotton is, in fact, one of the most heavily sprayed crops on the planet, so it stands to reason that our choice of clothing can have a major ecological impact. Fortunately, solutions are out there. Organic cotton, and other alternative|`|0dg174ohaa	It is a matter of thinking on your environmental footprint every time you make decisions. Think on the different processes, transportation etc that  were necessary to produce the different goods and try to purchase the ones that seem better in that sense. Some times it is necessary to spend more money than you normally would to make the greener decision. For example by buying organic food.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	Going green is easy, there are so many great resources about the subject. My personal favorite is "The Green Book" which has parts of its book online as well at www.readthegreenbook.com.    As I have been striving to "Go Green" I realize it is like stepping back in time without getting rid of my modern conveniences. I'm doing many things I learned as a child, like line drying my clothes, sweeping instead of vacuuming, opening the windows in the morning to catch the cool breeze, only buying what I need instead of everything that looks cool, growing some of my own food, and canning what I can't eat now.     To me "going Green" is a frame of mind. Do what fits your lifestyle and do the easy things first, it is a process and like dieting if you go to radical to soon, you are more likely to go back to bad habits. I also believe there are good, better, best choices in most things. If you aren't ready to start a home garden, then try finding a farmers market, until you locate one look for produce grown as close to home as possible and go organic when available.     Many people think "going green" is expensive, I disagree. Some changes may take an initial investment, but they usually have a short payoff time. Things like weatherstiping and insulation cost, but the energy savings will add up quickly. You may need to purchase reusable bags, but most stores give you a 5 or 10 cent credit, so you are paid back within a few months.     My top tips are make your home more energy efficient, that also means using natural light, cooling and heating.     Reduce your packaging, if you eat more fresh food you will generally reduce packaging, it's the same thing they tell dieters, shop the perimiter, that is where all the meat, dairy and produce are located. Only buy what you will use, many Americans throw away a lot of unused food. Buy in bulk, that doesn't just mean large packages, but that area with the bins that you buy only what you plan on using.     Replace disposable items with durable items, if you eat outside often and use disposable paper or plastic plates, it is a wise investment to purchase a set of reusable plastic plates. Replace disposable razors, diapers and cleaning products like swiffer. Avoid bottled water, get a home filter like Pur or Brita.    Recycle, www.earth911.org will help you locate the nearest recycle center. I try to only purchase plastics that are  1 or  2, they are more easily recycled. I also buy recycled products when available, that includes paper towels, napkings, toilet paper, tissue, school/office supplies and clothing.    Detox your cleaning, vinegar and baking soda clean almost anything, they can even losen a hair clog. Seventh Generation and Method are a couple mainstream brands that are very earth friendly.     Just start small and build from there, don't get overwhelmed.|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	"Going Green" is the latest way the government is invading our personal lives.

A lot of companies still use harsh chemicals in their cleaners and things. You can help not doing this by buying from a company that was 'green' before it even had a name to it. I have been doing this for 5+ years now. I don't have to worry about my septic or about what my family is exposed to. I shop online every month and save money and time doing it. If you want to know more, let me know. It was the best thing I ever did and I will never buy my household products again from the local stores. They cost more and I have no idea what I am subjecting myself and my family to by using them.

Retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist Dr. John S. Theon, the former supervisor of James Hansen, NASAs vocal man-made global warming fears soothsayer, has now publicly declared himself a skeptic and declared that Hansen embarrassed NASA with his alarming climate claims and said Hansen was was never muzzled. Theon joins the rapidly growing ranks of international scientists abandoning the promotion of anthropogenic global warming fears.    Theon declared climate models are useless.    Furthermore, some scientists have manipulated the observed data to justify their model results. In doing so, they neither explain what they have modified in the observations, nor explain how they did it. They have resisted making their work transparent so that it can be replicated independently by other scientists. This is clearly contrary to how science should be done. Thus there is no rational justification for using climate model forecasts to determine public policy, he added.    [Note: Theon joins many current and former NASA scientists in dissenting from man-made climate fears. A small sampling includes: Aerospace engineer and physicist Dr. Michael Griffin, the former top administrator of NASA, Atmospheric Scientist Dr. Joanne Simpson, the first woman in the world to receive a PhD in meteorology and is formerly of NASA, Geophysicist Dr. Phil Chapman, an astronautical engineer and former NASA astronaut, Award-Winning NASA Astronaut/Geologist and Moonwalker Jack Schmitt, Chemist and Nuclear Engineer Robert DeFayette was formerly with NASAs Plum Brook Reactor, Hungarian Ferenc Miskolczi, an atmospheric physicist with 30 years of experience and a former researcher with NASA's Ames Research Center, Climatologist Dr. John Christy, Climatologist Dr. Roy W.

According to a recent poll published in Eos, 97% of active climate scientists thought that humans were strongly contributing to temperature changes.    So there's a chance that up to 3% of them will disagree and there should be a small proportion of papers out there to support their opinion. I'd recommend google scholar or web of science.    http://scholar.google.com    I haven't found any myself yet despite looking through hundreds of abstracts. I found 80+ in support of global warming and zero against. Oreskes (Science, 2004) looked at over 900 papers and found the same thing (ie none 'against' global warming)    There are some papers that are anti-global warming but many of them are out of date and subsequent research undermined them. For example Lassen & Friis-Christensen (1991).    Hopefully someone else will be able to help you more.|`|9ebaf8d16d7b50a2ee9544e3db0788c8aa	Not many if any. Might be because there is no "real scientific evidence" against global climate change....    You seem to suffer from *** - Anti Science Syndrome and an even more severe case of confirmation bias where the only "evidence" you'll accept is evidence which fits your foregone conclusion. That is not how science works.    @Mick T - the article about Jim Hansen you bring up is full of false claims. I've posted a link in the sources to a blog which takes it apart. Also, there is ample evidence that Hansen (and many other scientists dealing with climate change) was indeed muzzled. See the sources for a link to a big committee report coming to this conlusion "The evidence before the Committee leads to one inescapable conclusion: the Bush Administration has engaged in a systematic effort to manipulate climate change science and mislead policymakers and the public about the dangers of global warming."

Je m'explique: le nuclaire, aujourd'hui, est polluant et dangereux, car bas sur la fission (on casse des noyaux d'uranium qui se dcomposent en plutonium et autres atomes et librent ainsi de l'nergie). Cette technologie est ma?trise, mais potentiellement dangereuse.    Il y a des recherches pour passer  la fusion nuclaire, qui est le contraire de la fission. Cette fa?on consiste  prendre des atomes lgers (detrium, un hybride de l'hydrogne) et  les faire fusionner entre eux pour obtenir des atomes plus lourds.    Cette mthode donne trs peu de dchets radioactifs, et en plus beaucoup-beaucoup moins radioactifs.     C'est la mthode pour 2050, au point ou en sont les essais et les recherches (il y a des contraintes terribles pour y arriver, et on ne sait pour le moment le faire que sur d'infimes quantites de matires).
