20090205141425AAVAB3G	Games & Recreation;Amusement Parks	Disney World Secrets ?	what re some of them i know  :            The drawbridge to Sleeping Beautys Castle really works.  Its been raised only twice: once on opening day, and once in the l980s when Fantasyland reopened.        The crest above the drawbridge is the Disney family crest.        It took only 364 days to build Disneyland.        Main Street represents Walts home town, Marceline, Missouri, in 1901, the year he was born.        The organ that was in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea now lives in the ballroom of the Haunted Mansion.        In the early years of the park, the Rivers of America were stocked with catfish and visitors were allowed to fish off the docks of Tom Sawyer Island.        When Disneyland launched its original Submarine Voyage ride, it included Weeki Wachee-type mermaids swimming among the submarines.  Heres a video of them.     Disneyland was expected to fail.    Tomorrow Land is so outdated.    A ghostly Hazmat problem. (people trying to dump ashes in the haunted mansion)    Steve Martin used to work in the magic shop here.    There used to be live girls dressed like mermaids in the 2000 Leagues Under the Sea pool.     Did your balloon pop? Just show any balloon seller your popped balloon and theyll give you a new one.    The Imagineers put special touches everywhere. The Haunted Mansion features faces of a few of the early Imagineers and has tombstones written with inside joke references.        Coke gives the park free soda to eliminate competition in the park and for the advertising.        Hidden Mickeys are spread all over the park and theres at least one in every ride.      are there any more

I have some in high grade sheet protectors and D-Ring binders, while others are in sheet protectors and are laying flat inside of a box.

I was thinking of going out and buying magazine boards and bags with the proper boxes, so they could stand vertically, but is this only a temporary solution to my problem or is the best solution? And if I do this, are there magazine bags out there that I don't need to use Scotch Tape on? If I do end up using Scotch Tape on the bags, what do you recommend?      I am open to any and all ideas, so if you can help, I would love to hear from you.      Thanks!

20090205150604AAEX87Y	Games & Recreation;Video & Online Games	Some S.W.G.(star wars galaxies) Questions?	First off when I buy the cd and download it do I have to pay a monthly fee after that? I know it sounds a little strange to some(or at least to me) but I saw it somewhere when I was researching the game.      2: Do I need the base disc to use the expansions? I know that's how it regularly goes but I'm just trying to get to know everything about it.       3: In your opinion, is Star Wars Galaxies very complicated or difficult? I was trying to figure out things like what profession to pick or if being a politician is worth putting more effort into the game, and it seemed pretty overly complicated to me.      4: Back to the profession thing. What would you say the best profession and sub-profession(s) to be? I was thinking maybe a bounty hunter or a spy but an artisan looks interesting as well.       Please answer even if you can't answer all of those questions. I'll take one good answer to a question over cruddy answers for all my questions

20090205122106AATEuJF	Games & Recreation;Gambling	Are raffle contests against the law?	Dear Fellow Readers,      I would like to start a legitimate raffle contest website and was wondering what the laws were for raffle contests here in Canada. To my knowledge, gambling is illegal unless it is done in a legalized area. ie: Casino.  Gambling at home is also considered illegal, but only up to an extent.      If someone could inform me what the laws are for raffle contests here in Canada, it would be much appreciated. I plan to give a large portion to a select charity (that charity will be drawn at random, but will be taken out of the equation until all other charities have been selected.  I don't plan to make any huge profit, but I do want to make enough to break even each month.      I look forward to hearing from you.   Thanks
