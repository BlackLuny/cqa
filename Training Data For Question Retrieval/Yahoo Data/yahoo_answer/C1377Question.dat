Ok, I've got a very confusing problem: I have pretty nice facial features, and my friends, family, and people I meet tell me I'm a stunner, better looking than 98% of the girls my age, etc. But there are literally gangs of boys that call me ugly everyday, and it's really beginning to effect me.

20090203152636AA1dO1z	Social Science;Psychology	Sociopaths! an open discussion.?	I am a fifteen year old girl, and I have a sociopath as a father. He is still alive but has lost much of his charm/sociopathic abilities since suffering a brain injury 3 summers ago.      Since then I have started highschool and recently met ANOTHER person I know is a sociopath. (just what I need right?) although he doesnt have a diagnoses, on account of he is a year shy of being able to legally get one in this country, I can still tell he is a sociopath, as I have dealt with one all my life.      I know the proper instinctual thing to do would be avoid him at all costs,   but like most people, I am extremely intrigued by his wit and intellegence      and would like to ask something      does anyone know if the sociopath has a weakness? drugs? sex? rage? does it vary from subject to subject?      also   after speaking to him, I feel very weak and vulnerable, Is there a way to show him assertivness in a way a sociopath will recognize?      I am EXTREMELY interested in sociopathy and would truly benefit from the answers. Thank you in advance.
20090203151850AAT4LH1	Social Science;Psychology	BIPOLAR dating and Silent Treatment?	I've been dating this 17-year-old bipolar person who is currently giving me the silent treatment (intentionally) for the second time this year.  If he gets angry thats how he responds, by disappearing out of my life with 100% contact.  And he is medicated with Seroquel and going to therapy so supposedly hes "stable" as he can be.      Is the silent treatment/disappearing act related to bipolar disorder or is he just a heartless loser who dumps a romantic partner without even discussing it or returning my calls, emails, voicemails, etc.      I guess theres nothing i can do is someone doesnt want to talk to me after being friends for  almost a year and intimate several times.      He's already had 14 relationships and slept with countless others, been in rehab twice, spent 6 months in foster care at age 16, works p/t at mcdonalds, lives with his step-mom and biological dad, is a little schizo, a sexual nypho, acts impulsive, controlling, manipulative, and he  dropped out of high school last year but is trying to get his GED but only has 3 high school credits to his name.

20090203153658AAzeJYt	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How many women are turned on by being dominated?	I realize that this question sounds a bit sexist, but I've found almost invariably that women are turned on by being dominated. Maybe it's just me - I'm 6'3", 245, and bald - but the more violent and aggressive I acted in bed, the more women loved it. I found that, regardless if the female was 4'11" or 6'5" (I've dated both), the recipe for turning them on could be broken up into:      1) Hold them down firmly by the wrists...apply enough pressure to hurt them slightly, yet not to cause serious pain.      2) Thrust as hard as you can.      3) While doing so, mouth in an angry, aggressive tone things like "Yeah, you like this, don't you?" and "Come on, beg for it".      I admit, I'm less than thrilled by the whole procedure...while some men get off on dominating someone, I find it sort of caveman-esque and was a bit disappointed to find that the women were so traditional and stereotypical in what they liked. However, I've posted questions in the past mentioning that I hated my height and build and generally people acted like I was crazy, like almost all women wanted a big man who would "ravage" them. It's hard for me to reconcile turning someone on with something I totally hate about myself, but there isn't exactly a way for me to alter my height, build, nor baldness.

I decide that I want to plant flowers all over Abigail's grave. So my husband and i buy bunches of beautiful flower's to plant, but when we get to the cemetery, we realize we don't have a spade, so we call the caretakers. When they arrive the skies get really dark, and as they start to dig holes for the flowers, snakes come up, hundreds of them.       The dream really scared me, and I haven't been able to sleep well since I've had it. It's definitely NOT something i want to remember when I think of my daughter.

My wife of 5 years has this "psychic" that she has known since before she met me, and has phone readings with her anytime we are trying to make a big decision.  She even goes so far as to inquire about our own relationship, when we are having problems or fights. My wife takes what this psychic says very seriously, more so than I am comfortable with. My wife even says "if my psychic says that we don't need to be together, then that's it, we're finished.        I guess the question is: Is this normal thinking? I really don't know how to approach this situation, but I feel angry that someone else is playing "god" with our relationship, and my wife would do anything they predict. I feel I can't make progress in a relationship that has to be run-by a so-called psychic. Is it fair to ask that she cease talking to the psychic? I don't tell my wife what to do or who to talk to, so I really don't know what to do about this.

Yesterday, I had my first class for this subject that I had taken, I sat in this column of seats in which I was the only occupant. It's an extremely uncomfortable column to sit in as it is just next to the window and it tends to get extremely sunny. This one girl (waaaay out of my league IMO) just sat right behind me today, when she was sitting at the other end of the class with her friends yesterday...    1- is it possible that she does like me?   2- I have been unsuccessful in other such attempts to get sorta intimate with a girl (no, not intimate as in physically intimate), is there anything I should not do specifically do turn a person off? I just try to carry on normal conversations with such potential crushes but I keep messing up or I end up turning the girl off for some reason...

In an open letter to her organization, The National Women's Studies Association President, Beverly Guy-Sheftall states,"NWSA makes active and ongoing efforts to dismantle racism and white supremacy in its structure and programs. For example, the NWSA Governing Council engages in anti-racism training annually as part of its board development work, and has a thriving Women of Color Leadership Project (www.nwsa.org/projects/woclp.php) that is intended to provide support and training for women of color interested in program, center, and NWSA leadership. To be sure, this work is difficult and ongoing, and we don’t pretend that NWSA always practices what it preaches. We also recognize that women’s studies as a field continues to engage in struggles around racism and white supremacy in a variety of ways. I believe that NWSA can provide leadership as we continue to engage in difficult dialogues around difference.

Answer: Maybe quit jobs that don't pay highly in the first place, men tend to aim for hard laboring jobs or jobs that pay much more better then a career doing nails.      3) Why do the media show fat guys married to slim women?      Answer: Because history wise..........your not suppose to be bigger then your guy...nature wanted it that way!!!! Its like a duh moment!

20090203162737AA1TuMV	Social Science;Psychology	Is it bad and abnormal to always need to be independent in life?	I'm a 28 year old male. Lately I've been thinking a lot about why I always feel the need to be independent in life even when I was a young teenager. Like not asking my older brother if I can live with him. I always want to figure it out on my own and be independent. Maybe I'm being selfish and overly involved with myself, I'm not sure.
20090203160110AA4IirH	Social Science;Psychology	How can I accept myself given these circumstances?	First off: I have been diagnosed with asperger's syndrome disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, obsessive compulsive personality disorder, and major depression.       I learn by questioning - I question everything. If one of my questions on a topic comes back with a reasonable response, and comes back with several more reasonable responses to my several other questions, only then can I comprehend it. If something leaves a slew of unanswered questions of mine I cannot comprehend it.       People say that I am a good person and intelligent despite my school circumstances. I find that the only subject in school I am good at is geography - I really like geography. I am also good at philosophy; I forgot about that one. But the amount of subjects I struggle immensely at completely outweigh the one I am good at.      Good = Geography, philosophy   Bad = Math, physics, business, economics, English, French, art, drama, sports, creative writing, computer courses, biology, chemistry, history, etc.      This isn't to say that I do not try in the courses I struggle immensely at - I do try hard. This is an example of how trying just doesn't seem to be enough.       At the same time I see other students excel in nearly everything without even so much as blinking an eye.       How can I possibly be a good person and be intelligent if these are the only subjects in school I can do well in?  Does this not make me less than the students who excel in everything? I have almost no friends to rely on, as socializing is another aspect of life I struggle with. What other ways are a "good person" and an "intelligent person" defined as?

20090203160352AAeX0hb	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Weird dreams about my crush? Kinda random? lol.?	I have a crush on some kid called Chris that's in one of my classes at school. History. We're both 16.      We're not even friends, really. I've barely spoken to him. But he's hot, and even more attractively.. he's got a chillax, and unique personality, he's smart.. which is what drives me crazy over him. Strange, as I don't even know him, although I'm a friend of some of his mates.      I've had this crush for about two months now, since November? In December '08, I had a dream he beat me up against a vending machine, in the school cafeteria      But more recently, as I think my crush got deeper, I dreamt we were kinda friends and he stood me up or something? I don't 100% remember... it's just all random.       I don't think I've had such a powerful crush before. And I'm expecting to dream of him again soon..      Answers appreciated, thanks!

He did fine in first grade  but this year has been a bit harder for him as far as social skills, his academics are fine. He wants to stay back this year because he wants to go back to his younger friends. He does not like being younger then the other children and thinks we should let him stay back. His teachers feel he is ready to move on. He is now turning in bad work and trying to get bad grades. His teacher has told me that she has no doubt that he is doing this because he is trying to fail.

Do you think that men would be more 'maternal' and domestic if they were given toys that encouraged domesticity, like baby dolls, EZ Bake Ovens, toy strollers, etc.?  I'm not saying that they should or shouldn't be given these things, but is it any wonder why so many 15-year-old girls are talking about how they 'want babies'?  How can we be surprised when, from a young age, a lot of girls were given toys that only encouraged domesticity?

20090304181033AA1uepW	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream scents normal?  And meaning?	Well this is a little weird I think, but does anybody else smell things in their dreams?  Not real life things, but it's actually part of the dream.  Sometimes I smell things so strongly it wakes me up, because I'm panicking about smoke or something.  Then when I wake up the smell is gone.  I will sniff and sniff but there is nothing.        I have never been 100% sure it was a dream thing until the other night, that's when I had it happen most recently and longest.  I smelled this strong scent, woke up in a panic, sniffed the air quite a lot and decided the smell was in my head (it was and usually is a smoky smell), and the smell came back when I went back to sleep!        Anyway, I just wondered if anyone else does this or I'm weird.  Also what it might mean would be cool, too!  :)  Thanks!      ps: I have had this "in my dream scent" at multiple homes, not just in my apartment.

20090304180031AAsnjS5	Social Science;Psychology	How do you start a social life from scratch?	I'm a deeply depressed, anxious, insecure 17 year old guy. (I am in therapy and on drugs for it.) I've been struggling with social anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem for almost ten years now, and I've had basically no social life since it started. Now I find myself about to graduate from high school, 17 years old, single, with about two close friends that I hardly ever associate with outside of schoo. How do you start putting together a social life from scratch at 17 years old when everyone you know already has judged you and you can't start a friendship?      I desperately want to feel like I fit in, like I belong to a group--I can't remember ever being around people my age and not feeling painfully out of place, like I had no right to be there. I've spent too much of my life in books and shying away from people. The loneliness is killing me and my depression will only continue to get worse until I find a way out.      People tell me I'm good-looking and well-spoken, and don't come off as nervous. But if you're messed up in the head like me, none of that counts for much.

My friend told me that my husband was not being a real man when he "LET" me make the decision to move our family to the USA because my job location is changing places. He apparently thinks that because my husband went along with my decision to change locations that makes him less of a man. He even went on to say that only men are suppose to move their families behind their jobs, that its just nor right to see a woman making that decision. SO I was like wtf?!?! I am not only the owner of the company but I am the only one working. And its not as though I did not sit down and discuss this with my husband before we moved. We talked about this three months before our twins were born. So this was a dual decision. Not one that I made and he had no obligation. I cant believe he said he's not being a real man!

20090225070658AAR6pGi	Social Science;Other - Social Science	There's this guy at my university?	There’s this guy at my university who live in same dorm as me. He’s also in my photography class. This guy is making me and many other guys crazy. He’s in early 20’s and works as a bodyguard for some bigwig. He got offended if someone ask him about his job or how they can apply for it. He’s downright cold, very calloused, and his sense of humor is downright sick! He often laughs and joke about other people who are suffering or got hurt.   Last semester his roommate who is a 6’4 and nearly 300 lbs linebacker moved out because he says this guy creep him right out. This guy is only about 5’10 give or take a inch and may 170 lbs at the most. This semester, his roommate moved out as well. No body else want to share room with this guy at all. So he have room to himself both semesters.   If asked, most girls would say he’s nothing amazing but handsome, however there’s something about him that appear so cold and empty. Yet this didn’t stop him from sleeping with like half of the girls on the campus or even pulls a three some with two girls off more on somewhat regular base. Sometime he even demean, act like a jerk, etc… toward them few days or week beforehand.   One of my female friends who I was really courting once says this guy is not her type but quite good looking but he’s way too unemotional for her taste and dress way too sharp for her liking. I was so sadden to found out she end up sleep with this guy a couple weeks later. When I asked her why she did it, she just says she don’t know. To make thing worst, she’s not the type who sleep around.   He even brought in a couple big name models (mostly those who models for some websites such as suicide girl) for photography class and even got them to spend the night with him.    Other bizarre thing is, he seems to have unnatural ability to pick up anything. Last semester he cannot even shoot a picture well but now this semester, he’s pretty much at professional level. Other thing is, in early winter, he watched the wrestlers practicing for a while then was a fair game when he decide to have a friendly match with them. Now no body can beat him at all.   How could this guy manage to pulls everything off? It’s really bugging me. I just don’t understand how he could accomplish all of those tasks, especially being pretty much a aloof jerk with no emotional or socializing skill.

20090304182911AAInufn	Social Science;Economics	Can anyone provide macroeconomics homework help?	You are considering buying a property of $450,000. The property has a building on it which is worth $130,000, and the rest of the price represents the value of the land.   The nominal interest rate is 5.4, and everyone expects no inflation for the foreseeable future. Assume that the building depreciates at the rate of 4% per year, and the land depreciates at the rate of 1% per year.   Your utilities will cost $300 per month, and insurance is $1400 per year.   Taxes are levied at the rate 2.9% on the entire value of your property.   You have saved up $45,000 that you can use as a down payment.      Mortgage lenders require that your total annual housing costs (including mortgage interest*, maintenance costs, taxes, insurance, and utilities) do not exceed 40% of your after-tax income.   Calculate the annual after-tax income you need in order to be able to afford this property.      *Note: In similar calculations, mortgage lenders usually use the entire mortgage payment (which includes amortization of the principal) instead of just the interest cost to gauge how much you can afford to borrow. For simplicity, we use the first year interest cost here, because the complete mortgage calculation is too difficult to do by hand.       I don't necessarily need the answer, I was just working on this problem thinking I was heading in the right direction, and I ended up getting the answer wrong so now I'm clueless. Any help will be appreciated.

I used to be a productive and successful person. But I can't cope with reality. I did fine in the years of college that didn't count, but as soon as it came to actually mattering i just couldn't function and seemed like my own worst enemy. I feel like I am not worthy of friends, boys or my family. I have put on weight and I feel that I'm just a mess. I'm not the happy, smart and successful person that I used to be.      I don't know who I am anymore, I feel lost and like such a loser. I feel like everything I do and say is worthless. I feel worthless. I can't motivate myself to find a job. I can barely motivate myself to leave the house I'm just so so tired all the time.       Has anyone gone through this. I'm hoping it's a phase after you finish college. I want to figure it all I really do but I constantly feel panicked and I constantly feel sick.

20090304184037AAgArzR	Social Science;Psychology	Changing myself to become more intelligent?	I'm sick and tired of being confused in class. Read the terms and have no idea whats going on. Bombing tests. Feels horrible. For once in my life I want to be smart. Not be looked upon like, oh that guy, yeah he's probably never read a book in his life. Everyone at my school cheats, lies, and does everything to get their way. I don't want to be that person anymore. I want to be educated and respected. I want to be book smart, I'm already street smart, or at least I think I am. I want to be able to understand what's going on in AP BIO and other tough classes and surprise my teachers. Although this is my mission, I also want fun time, I don't want to be reading books all day and have no social life. That just isn't me.

20090304183936AAwO6mU	Social Science;Psychology	How do I deal with trying to look good or being just me?	Hi! I'm a guy and I have a hard time with this. The truth is, I'm one of those persons that can look totally different when dressed up than when I don't care. I know this for sure because of the responses I get from people. When I dress with attractive clothes, style my hair to look "hot", etc... people at my job treat me very well. Everybody smiles at me, I can see their shine in their eyes when they look at me, I don't know what it is.       However, there are days when I don't have time to dress up as much, and those days I don't get the same responses from people. I smile at people and they don't smile back, and that just makes me feel bad, frustrated.       I just don't know how to deal with this! Because I wished so much that people kept treating me the same regardless if I look smoking hot or if I don't look that good.      What should I do? should I keep trying to look my best everyday? Sometimes I say NO. That I shouldn't do things for other people or because of them, but then again, dressing up avoids me of such feelings of frustration. However, I don't know if by doing that I'm just avoiding the fact that I care too much of what other people think of me.      I'm so confused. Should I keep trying to look good until I find a way to deal with not looking so good and not having the nice treatment from people?      I don't know, has anybody gone through this?   I wish I could write more stuff, but I'll probably confuse and turn down answers.       Please help!
20090304202237AA1juGm	Social Science;Psychology	Is pathological lying a symptom of schizophrenia? And to what extend are schizophrenics culpable for their?	This guy I used to be friends with has lied so frequently it's possible to know when he's telling the truth, so I don't know if I should believe him that he has paranoid schizophrenia and manic depression / bipolar. He frequently pulls attention-seeking stunts such as threatening to kill himself and freaking me out and then saying he was just kidding, and becomes totally obsessed about random things, acts inappropriately towards others (he's 30 and claims to be in love with me!) and he lies nonstop. I confronted him about it all the other day and he said the reason for the horrific verbal attack and threats he'd launched at me was because he was schizophrenic / manic depressive / bipolar and couldn't help it. I don't know if he was being honest, or if that was just another lie.
20090304195816AAApa1I	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	The age old question?	Why are girls considered sluts if they went out with a few guys and did some stuff or whatever then guys are considered players or they get "props" for "tapping that ***" Why can't girls get that kind of "title?" Tell me what you think. Please don't be rude, I would just like a general opinion.

Well I am turning 14 tomorow and well if their is a decision i have to make here ital to myself to help decide what to do also i have very low selfesteem and confidence im somewhat suicidal but i would never kill myself here is an example of what i do                Ok I am in school today I just finished my exam I am the first one done and we have a hour and a half to go I sit their and tell myself to get up and turn it in but then i stall and think well maybe i should wait or maybe I should check it over I had talked to mysef for 15 minutes thinking what should i do trying to get the confidenceto stand up and turn it in ( usually get rude comments when i am first to turn stuff in i am like teachers pet in a way) and well i thought that if i got up people would laugh at me or call me names or the teacher would look at me funny iwas scared and so i talked in my head for 15 minutes and decided i wouldnt turn it in until atleast one other person did so i sat their and waited for somene to turn theirs in immediately after i walked up and turned it in and well idk why i made a big something bout absolutely nothing .

20090304201254AAs3T8q	Social Science;Psychology	Who actually goes out with the intention (or expectation) of meeting random people during the DAY?	i put "day" in caps to exclude night clubs and bars. anyone here go out and actually try to meet strangers in random places? or do you get all your dating prospects by meeting friends of friends or in classrooms where you're forced to interact with others      I personally like the complete strangers approach. im not a part of many groups and i'm no longer in high school, so the whole "forced to meet someone" thing doesn't really exist for me. if i want to meet new people i have to do it the hardest way. but just talking to random ppl during the day.      if anyone else does this. what's your typical approach like? success stories? horror stories?
20090304195939AA6UAd7	Social Science;Psychology	If you wouldn't mind reading a kinda long story, can you plz help me with some boy problems? :]?	Well... there's this guuuy... :) Haha. Well, anyways, we've known each other since the fifth grade (Now we're in eighth) and it seemed like he liked me in fifth cuzze would always brag to me that we are both asian and blush and all that jazz. Haha. And in 6th he would tease me alot and try to act all cool and stuff. 7th we didn't have any classes together except for p.e. and the girls and boys were always separated, so the only time I really talked to him was this one time when my p.e. class and I were playing golf and the guys were running loops and he came up to me and asked if he could try and I said sure and he hit it really far and it kinda seemed like he was trying to impress me a lil and after I told him how good he was I toldem that his voice changed and he blushed, looked down, smiled, and was all yeeeeeeaaaaahh.... then the p.e. teacher told him to get lost and that was the end of that love story. LOL. JK! Now, in eighth, he always says hi to me while I see him in passing periods and whenever everyday, and I would always smile and say hi back. :) Also, he used to playfully block my way to the locker room too and I started liking him.... but then he stopped for a little while and I got kinda sad. :( But now he waves and says hi again. :) And today I had to stay in my math class late to finish up a test and he T.A's for the next period and I got up to turn in my test and it was all quiet and he smiled and said (a little loud) Hi *Ariana!. And yess... you guessed what I did next. :D And this morning I went in for extra math help and I saw him there helping a group of guys (He's in advanced) and I guess he's pretty good at it and I was thinking that maybe he could tuor me.... :) But I want to get to know him better and get more in the friend zone b4 I askem that and get his number cuz I always get to know guys alot better through texting for some reason. But idk if he's liked me all these years and he is just shy or if he doesn't or what. Btw, he doesn't act the way he does for all his other girl buds like he does to me. He's very outgoing and has no problem being open and funny with the rest of them... so I just don't know what's going on... :( Talk about mixed signals huh?      *name has been changed

20090304200829AAyAYY9	Social Science;Psychology	It is said that your Thinking controls the type of Emotions you feel? Is this true?	Im an overly sensitive person and a deep thinker. I can get upset easily over small things. And I view most people as truly pathetic, and prefer being by myself. Im easily hurt and affected by things. But i dont show it. Just suffer and break down inside. I was just wondering if that statement was true or not. So what if i learned the correct thinking pattern, so that i could experience more positive emotions? Is it possible?
20090304205506AAtrWGw	Social Science;Psychology	What do you regret the most?	We all have regrets. Something we've done in the past, that we later look back and try to erase from our minds, but it never happens. The important thing is to leave it in the past and convince yourself that you've gotten knowledge since then. You'll also wonder what was going through your mind when you did it, knowing that it didn't make sense. But that is actually proof that over the years you have become more mature.      If you don't want to post anything you regret, need not respond to this question. But if you'd like to answer, please state the darkest and most severe regret you have. Stating the event on here may be all it takes to make you feel better.      Don't be afraid of being lashed out at. I'll even tell you mine. One time I called one of my friends on the phone for a prank, telling them I was being abused and they needed to call the cops.
20090304195305AAHmfN3	Social Science;Psychology	Does cognitive thought make us human?	I am studying biotechnology at UCLA and I was raised Christian so I have moral concerns regarding much of my coursework. These are a few of my issues.      Most people would say yes. It is what separates us from the animals. So consider this:       A man has lost all cognitive ability. The body lays still in a coma and he has no ability to reason or make decisions even in a subconscious state.      Is he still human? Or just a piece of meat much like a dead body?      Next scenario: An embryo is maturing in it's mothers womb. It does not yet have any brain function. Are these cells a human yet?       Essentially, both situations have an either pre or ex human body. I will accept that they are both living creatures. This however, does not make them humans. If anything they are in a pre- or post- human state.      Comments?

My therapist told me there was a good chance of it,but i never went back after the first visit to get mediicine or anything.

I woke up scared, i don't know what's wrong with me. has anyone ever experienced this? ]: I'm really scared... This happens a few times too.

20090304200135AAw5lE8	Social Science;Psychology	Whats wrong with me, i have no personality?	im too shy, and i mean incredibly shy. I have no Friends and i mean not one, but i have a load of acquaintances and i just cant get over that MASSIVE hurdle of going from being an acquaintance to being a friend. Im really sick of it, I think of the things to say but i just cant get it out, and i talk too quietly, and i just don't know whats wrong with me. its hard to explain, its like im not shy in my mind, but the second it comes to interacting what i try and do/say, just ends up being a mess. In all reality i dont feel sorry for myself, if i knew someone like me, i wouldnt be my friend lol. i dont ever let people near me enough to let them get to know me, because i dont know how. thats something ive always wondered. how can someone i meet tomorow, ten years down the line be a best friend, these things just seem to happen, but not yet to me. i just wish i had a bit of confidence thats all, i could run a list of problems with my life, but then so couldnt most people, but the main issue i have is with my inablity to interact,

20090304221837AAbYvgc	Social Science;Psychology	Friends with a psychopath???	Okay, so there is this person I met in high school and we used to be really good friends although she has always seemed a little off.    She was really smart yet rarely ever did her homework, anyway one day when we were sophomores (15) she showed me a gold necklace that she stole from her bf's mom. I was really surprised and told her she should put it back, but she just responded by getting really angry and saying she never should have told me but she thought I would understand; she was only mad for a few seconds then she just smiled and left… when I asked her about it later she denied the incident saying I might have dreamed about it and calling me crazy.    So a few years later (after we all graduated) I found out she went to an insane asylum for a while because they said she was a sociopath, after that happened everything from high school started to make more sense.    She was there for a few years and now she moved back, she seems pretty much the same just really fake as if she is acting though sometimes when I see her around children or when she is comfortable I can see parts of her old self coming back, she used to be wild and unpredictable but now she is more reserved and quiet.      What does this mean exactly? Do you think she is just putting on an act?   Should I stop hanging out with her and just start avoiding her?        The thing is sometimes when I talk to her about it she seems to be bragging about being a sociopath and other times she gets angry.  The thing is I really feel like she loves me and I think she would be devastated if something happened. But is it possible for a sociopath to love? I heard it wasn’t but what if the person benefited the sociopath in some way I mean my friend seems to like interaction with others, so wouldn’t she be upset if they all died? She also seems to get along with children and like them, so what does that mean?
