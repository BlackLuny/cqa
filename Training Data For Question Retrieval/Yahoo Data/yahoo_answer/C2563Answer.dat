yunxzevlaa	best way to go about it is to get car magazines of those countries and get dealer infos. will give you lots of specialized varieties.
AA10132629	Just to put it in perspective, I passed my car, motorcycle and CDLA tests 1st try but that's because I have been driving all of them since I was big enough to reach everything, and I was raised as a mechanic which helps !!! If you are having so much trouble passing the test all I can say is practice as often as you possibly can somewhere safe with a KNOWLEDGIBLE person who is willing to be patient. Concentrate on your weak points, ask questions and use your head. I've taught many people and they have all passed the test on their next attempt. Don't give up and stay focused, you can do it if you keep trying ! I have my fingers crossed for ya hon !!!!!|`|yuBuNoPDaa	No. I passed on the 3rd time. I went the first 2 times with my dad and the last time with my mom. I was so nervous. I couldn't calm my nerves. I went through drivers ed and had driving lessons from a school and my parents.|`|C5vOIeHGaa	yep, i passed first time after only 2 lessons :)<br>  although i had spent a year before hand driving without a lisence and mangaed to teach my self verything i needed to know, it was great. not once did i get caught,saved me alot of money!|`|nB0sKXJ1aa	it took me 3 times for my learners but once for my p plates if i did fail i would keep going until i got it but i am a great driver so i had no doubt but my brother got his on his 21st time dick lol|`|QmWO1Kfbaa	Three times on a motor bike , twice in a car .|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	I passed second!<br>  I did know one lad i went to school with passed on the 8th occasion so dont give up!|`|AA11220909	Yes - it was so easy.|`|9YWmMyT7aa	Yes!! 1st time woohoo|`|P69Ob0eeaa	No, Second time :)<br>  x|`|Tm11j4yXaa	Yes!

I wouldn't have given up as it costs so much money to do your lessons and test it would just feel like a complete waste of money.|`|QNObnVODaa	Motorbike - Second time.<br>  Car - First.<br>  <br>  Anyone who can't pass the test after 5 times,shouldn't be allowed to have a licence.|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	Car test passed first time, bus driving passed second time.|`|I9yHqIkJaa	Second time.<br>  <br>  Not bad for a plastic mouse with a scroll wheel.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|WaYZQhnHaa	1st try|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	Yes Passed 1st time|`|XVVkrlnTaa	I passed the first time.

daw140ceaa	I'm not sure why Alpine likes to put a "nom" setting on its gain control.  I think it's just to try to keep people from turning the gain all the way up.  ("NOM" is short for "nominal", which basically means that it should be the right setting in most cases).<br>  <br>  The answer to your question depends on the output voltage of your head unit's pre-amp outputs.  If you have a head unit with 4v outputs, then you'll probably need to turn the gain control down a bit.  If the head unit has 500mv outputs, then you'll probably need to turn it up.  The "nom" setting is about the right position for a head unit with 1v outputs.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure of your head unit's output voltage, or you just want to do it the easy way, then start by turning the amp gain all the way down.  Put a CD with decent bass in your CD player.  If your CD player has a "loudness" or "bass boost" setting, turn it off; and adjust the tone controls so there's no bass boost.  Start the car, and turn the CD player volume to the loudest comfortable listening level.  Make sure your front and rear speakers sound clean and undistorted. <br>  <br>  Slowly turn up the gain control until the subwoofer is as loud as you want it to be with your music, or until it starts to sound strained or distorted.  When this happens, turn it back down a bit until you get to the highest level possible without audible distortion.|`|YuWLcExJaa	Nom is "Nominal" or RMS<br>  <br>  RMS is 0.707 of Peak (PMPO/Peak music power output)|`|8ey4ArjXaa	"NOM" is a french word for name
lkNJNnlSaa	Oh my God, how did you manange that lol.<br>  <br>  I think you probably can, it's 12 points on the real driving license which will not allow you to drive for a while.|`|TiW72sAUaa	When you pass your test these days you already have the equivalent of 6 points on your licence as a new driver, therefore you would then have twelve. I would check first to see if you would be allowed to take your test.|`|FJlCys0Gaa	To the best of my knowledge.<br>  You can take a driving test if you already have points on your licence.<br>  If you then get a further 6 points on your licence after you pass the full test your licence will then be tacken off you.<br>  You will then need to apply for a new provisional, take an extender re-test and pass all over again.<br>  <br>  I advise you to speak to someone from the DVLA in person or ask a qualified reputable driving instructor. They get paid to know these things.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  x|`|907e3984a6f4f92078cc488022d7399daa	No you won't be able to.  In the first 2 years after passing, you are only allowed to be given 6 points (which you already have).  You will need to wait until those points expire.  But given your record already, you probably won't bother waiting.|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	Not sure but i think you would probably pass your practical so yes apply and then you wouldnt be able to drive as your ban (instant with 6 points within 2 years passing) would kick in. <br>  <br>  I think...|`|a6j7Bu9daa	You should never be allowed to drive again, how the hell can you get six points and you havent even got a full license yet?|`|Sv8bhwOXaa	The 6 points on your provisional license, you most likely served a 6 month ban for that right? and that's the punishment, so you can apply for a practical test.|`|LwZn1wWSaa	Err, Ask a Policeman, or call an insurance company for a quote and post it on youtube, i could do with a good laugh.|`|0798f885928e14331e56687dd0e96edeaa	i dunno
AjmwAjroaa	it depends on how many watts the subs can handle. be sure to check before buying an amp<br>  <br>  your average pair of 12 inch kickers would be well matched with a 1500 watt amp <br>  <br>  it also depends on how they are wired. assuming, they are wired sererately, you would want to get a 2 channel amp to split the power to the 2 subs<br>  <br>  a kicker zx 1500 would be a good one, but its like 600 bucks<br>  <br>  a rockford fosgate 1500 would run you about 700 bucks, but  these are the best brands in my opinion<br>  <br>  there are lots of good brands that will give you a good amp for 2-4 hundred bucks, just be careful of ones you havent heard of and do some research so you dont fry anything|`|swQUeteyaa	I have a kenwood 9104d monoblock amp powering to kenwood 12's.

7Zw1cEmPaa	Hi<br>  That is a common fault with the Citroen Picasso. My light has been on for months. Nothing to worry about
VdJRuTIRaa	Did you switch it off or did it die on the side of the road?<br>  if it was running and then you switched it off and then it will not start again it is a possibility that the crank trigger is faulty such as it works for a couple of seconds & then it stops and then it works again , or it could be a weak coil pack , sure there is spark but is it strong enough to jump the gap in the spark plug and have you tested the spark plugs if there original plugs ,chuck em out and put some new ones in.
7fdcd76738d2afbc3ff09cd9c935148baa	I use one called Reflex, it was good value at about ￡2000, comes with all plugs/connecters, but as with all of them you need to subscribe to the updates, which is about ￡300 a year(comes through the post). The only car it won`t do so far has been Mercedes, but apparently that`s quite common on most systems.|`|12FUwqKpaa	there isn't any specific one all have good points and bad points <br>  also the budget is an issue too, code readers and hand helds can range from ￡49 to around ￡1500-￡2000 <br>  other diagnostics on the market include bosch kts systems and snap on's diagnostic range which are priced from ￡1200-￡6000+, these aren't just code readers most vehicle systems can be reset and recoded with these aswell.<br>  most are standalones.<br>  my personal opinion for value and usability is the snap on solus pro which is around ￡1800<br>  laptop based is also an option with the panasonic toughboook around ￡500 and Launch systems are very useful as they have online support.<br>  as with all updates also cost and vary largely in price|`|1c9eb8a31186d1da1e78962f5c60e263aa	as with all diagnostics you have to choose the one that is most specific to what earns your bread and butter and then covers a wide mulitude of other applications too if using commercialy.The diagnostic usualy will not tell you specifically what is wrong but moreso will give you a narrow window to which you explore to identify the problem.You will still need a sound background in repairs to extract its full potential.
QcENsfCEaa	The impala would be a great car. the only thing I would ask about is the intake gasket if its been replaced. If not you would want it replace with that amount of miles. That is the biggest and just about only problem you see on those cars.|`|ktrruPfNaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - carinsurance.yoll.net|`|ylAEO8CGaa	its definlty a good price...miles a little high but for that price you canty complain...stay away from the older model even with the less miles...will have more problems in the long run
a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	If MIVEC works the way a lot of VVT systems do then it uses actuators that work on oil pressure.  If they get gummed up they don't work well.  You might want to try possibly flushing out the motor.|`|VdJRuTIRaa	its the rev limiter shift warning, the computer controls it. if you change to an aftermarket chip they don't have anything like that.

c48nm70gaa	Ojey, Please do not have your transmission flushed! It's far to have the oil drained and the transmission filter changed on a car with 150,000 miles. Reason being if there is any metal shavings or clutch material in the transmission it may lodge in the valve body passages or springs & check balls. Transmission shops and new car dealers do the best job. Prices are very competitive all over. Call around before you head out.|`|AA10331789	If your transmission fluid has never been flushed or changed, then many shops suggest you don't have it flushed now for fear that you will actually make things worse. Instead they recommend removing the transmission pan and draining the fluid and changing the filter. This might be called a "pan service" as described below. Your dealer will charge less for it than a flush and you won't risk clogging the transmission up with a lot of debris from the flushing process.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.extremehowto.com/xh/article.asp?article_id=60207" rel="nofollow">http://www.extremehowto.com/xh/article.a...</a>|`|7096c009cbfa017c4e16a7e737f601dcaa	I found the local mechanics charged more and were going to to it the wrong.

dyIyJqauaa	Call your insurance company.... Always call your insurance company. As to fault, It Doesn't matter one iota what the other driver says or doesn't say.  It doesn't matter what you or me or anyone else says.  All that matters is what the insurance company(s) say. You bought insurance for just this sort of thing.  USE IT !...They have dozens of lawyers at their disposal who will work for you for nothing.  You shouldn't nor do you need to hire a lawyer.   Don't worry about (if) your rates go up.  Simply notify your insurance company ASAP|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Your insurance company will find out either way, and they may give you a lawyer to fight the case, especially if this guy caused this accident on purpose which is what it sounds like.<br>  Find out which clinic is treating him and have your lawyer subpeona a list of how many patients they have treated for the their lawyer.<br>  They'll back off because they are probably running a scam.|`|Qg9fnKIdaa	First to call is a traffic policeman, for him to conduct an "on spot" accident report, make the sketch drawing of the incident particularly the positions of the involved vehicles. Have them recorded in the police blotter, which will be the basis of the filing of a case if it warrants, where the services of a lawyer comes in.  On the other hand, the insurance company will take charge in computing the extent of the damages thru their appraiser and the insurance company shall answer the cost of the repair applying the conditions set forth in the "third party liability" clause of the insurance policy.|`|f8240cd0e6b54863a050b702a65c786caa	Your insurance company should not raise your rates if you are not at fault.<br>  Tell them the story and they will argue the case for you.

They specialise in left of mainstream insurance - young drivers, drivers with points, that sort of stuff. ￡3,500 is way too high.|`|IUHVinT2aa	if you haven't passed yet the best way to do it is to insure on a provisional license as passenger ensures no boy racing, thus cheaper insurance and you build up no claims, so long as no accidents. <br>  <br>  other way to do it if passed is comparrison websites, once you get a cheap quote telephone this company, not telling them u got quote on internet as they need to pay website, thus higher quote, knocking a few quid off thier already cheap quote sayin from other insurer and asking them to beat it, this can be then repeated, remembering to knock off for every insurer until u get a quote that cant be beaten or 1 that is payable. they all want new young drivers, as higher premiums. <br>  <br>  as for the car, best idea is anything about a 1.2 as smaller engine means cheaper insurance. corsa is popular, but beware this car is seen as a boy racer vehicle by many insurance companies, go to dealers, get idea of car u want just now and shop around for quotes before purchase, as insurance may be double car value.<br>  <br>  pass plus can help to reduce insurance quotes, dependable on insurance company, try asking for quote with and with out it to see if worth while.|`|FJlCys0Gaa	the comparison websites are usually quite good.<br>  Go compare or confused.com.<br>  <br>  If you have insurence already these are a good place to start get a quote then negotiate with your current insurer you can usually get a few more pounds off.<br>  <br>  Another alternative is for your parents to take out the policy with you as a named driver. You don't build no claimes bonus this way but it is much cheeper.<br>  Once you have a few years driving experience the price starts to come down anyway.<br>  <br>  This is the way I did it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.<br>  <br>  xx|`|BbULWOPEaa	check a comparrison site like confused.com, or mysupermarket.com these should give you the best prices|`|ktrruPfNaa	carinsurance.yoll.net - check this one.

These days most people think that if you change the color or add chrome it's a chopper/bobber or a "custom", it just shows how ignorant the uninformed really are. I know, I have a 1948 Harley Panhead chopper, it has 8 inches added to the backbone, 4 inches added to the lower legs, rigid frame that's lowered, 38 degrees in the gooseneck and 12 inches over on the springer, strictly kick-start, no battery, a Joe Hunt magneto with just enough wiring to handle the engine and front and rear lights, no signal lights, no speedometer or tach, no mufflers and no front brake or front fender, that's a chopper. Get the idea ? I hope this helps you buddy !|`|59b1fddc617491e538d31b5a8aa3904aaa	Because you have to "chop" the frame , and either add to or remove part of the frame .<br>  At least that is the way you make one . <br>  Manufacturers make chopper style bikes , but they are not true choppers because they have not been modified .|`|AA10283947	I believe it is because of the length of the saddle, a phallic reference to the male genitals.|`|WxqeMSw7aa	Does yor question refer to the Raleigh Chopper and why it resembles chopped motorcycles, or to chopper motorcycles themselves ?<br>  <br>  If you are referrring to motorcycles then the idea is to "chop" away as much excess weight as possible to make the bike go faster.|`|4AbXxowTaa	Back in the old days, guys would just take stock bikes and 'chop' them up and make them into the custom machines that they wanted.

AA11872632	When you remove the gearbox, to see the THREE parts of the clutch, you will need the following:<br>  1....  Clutch set, consisting of the big clutch spring, the thin driven plate, and the small round "release bearing".<br>  <br>  Here it is for 99 pounds, VAT included, shipping??<br>  <a href="http://www.thepeugeotshop.co.uk/product/206_-_1.1_Petrol_Engine_-_Transmission_Clutch_205288-4492#" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepeugeotshop.co.uk/product/...</a><br>  The engines sizes 1.1 and 1.4 are the same price.<br>  <br>  2....  Two liters of new gear oil.  6 pounds??<br>  3. ... Maybe a new copper washer for the gearbox drain plug.<br>  4.  You should 'make' a clutch centering rod' for yourself.  This is a rod of wood or steel that fits perfectly inside the flywheel hole.  Wrap duct tape around your dowel until it is fat enough to fill the hole snugly.<br>  Then you "hang" the driven disc and big spring on the "centering rod", and tighten the bolts around the edge of the spring.<br>  5.  A small torque wrench is needed, to tighten all bolts equally, and not TOO tight.  This can be borrowed from a friend; you only need it for a few minutes.<br>  6.  Filling the gearbox is awkward.  You fill it until it slightly overflows.  You'll need two feet of clear plastic hose that fits a large funnel.  Pour gear oil in the funnel, and it runs into the gearbox filler hole.  Do you know where these holes are? (drain and fill)<br>  <br>  Are you going to do the work yourself?  Why not?

4d1ed0b771143afc8f21cd1ebe05d5c4aa	It depends on the source of your warranty.<br>  <br>  If the car was new, or still within the period of the manufacturer's warranty, you are still covered unless the manufacturer (not the dealer) goes under.<br>  <br>  Most non-manufacturer warranties on cars are actually insurance policies. If you have one of these you will have a policy booklet for it telling you how to claim, who provides the cover, what is and what isn't covered, etc. If you have this, you are still covered provided the insurance company backing the warranty is still in business.<br>  <br>  It is very rare for a dealer to provide the warranty themselves, but if this is the case, then you have lost the warranty backing, and have little chance of any refund from the administrators.|`|907e3984a6f4f92078cc488022d7399daa	You won't get a refund as they have no money.  And even if they do have some money to pay back creditors, I'm afraid you are way down the list of people to pack back.

If so, they will continue cover. If not, you have no claim.<br>  <br>  Thats why things like houses are covered by an indemnity guranteed warranty such as NHBC, if the builder goes bust you are still covered. Not true with cars.<br>  <br>  Even if you WERE entitled to a refund ( no idea where that logic came from ) you would not get one. You would become an unsecured creditor ( behind the administrators, staff, pension fund, leaseholders, suppliers etc ) to the company and have to wait and see what the administrators did with the company and its assets.<br>  <br>  If the company was making an operating profit but burdened by debt then the chances are it will come out of administration as a viable company BUT it will be a different company and you will have no claim over it. Thats the whole point of admin, to rid yourself of debt.<br>  <br>  If the company was not making an operating profit then chances are they will fold it and stop trading|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	It depends upon the warranty. If you bought from a used car operation that offered you a 6 month or such warranty, it is likely they were just offering that to sell the car. There was probably no cost involved. They were just agreeing to fix anything that happened within a 6 month period (or however long).<br>  <br>  If it is a new car, the warranty will be honored at any other dealership of the same brand.<br>  <br>  If you purchased a warranty, the warranty company is still responsible for the remaining warranty. Most of those type warranties are accepted at any other shop or you can pay for repairs and file a claim yourself to be reimbursed for repairs.<br>  <br>  If the warranty was with the place where you purchased the car, you're out of luck. You will not likely see any of your money back.|`|AA11403032	No you won't get a refund.  The company is insolvent.  It hasn't even got enough money to pay the people that it owes money to, let alone refund warranties.<br>  <br>  But is it a warranty from the garage or a manufacturers warranty?<br>  <br>  If it's a warranty from the garage, its just worthless now, but if it's from a manufacturer or something like Network Q it should still be valid.<br>  <br>  check your paperwork.|`|XVMxuADtaa	Your warranty will be with the manufacturer or some third party insurer.<br>  <br>  Which is good, because you will be such a low priority creditor that it will cost you more to claim your money than you would actually receive....|`|PwHQSAxvaa	No, the administrator is responsible for the warranty, you should be unaffected.

Don't listen to them.<br>  <br>  You can use any tire of any brand so long as it is the correct size, load index and speed rating.  Your car would have tires sized either 205/55R16 91H or 205/50R17 93V depending on options.  The former is the most popular tire size on the planet so plenty of choices.  The latter not so common but still at least a half-dozen good choices other than the hyper-expensive Michelins.|`|d1b265ad147a9439b694bc5df27f6064aa	Firstly, I am a mechanic and I know plenty about tires. We work on cars so I would only hope we know something. I am also hoping that the guy installing the tires is a mechanic / tire technician.<br>  <br>  As per Mark F, please don't bash Mechanics for not knowing what we do considering that we do all aspects of automotive repair.<br>  <br>  To answer your question in more detail. You don't need to put on same brand of tire on that car. Contrary to what someone else tells you, when you have 195/50/16 tires on the car and you go to a 205/50/16 you will most likely have th tires rub in the wheel well.<br>  <br>  What is important when buying tires is that you get the same size and the same speed rating tire, (91H), (93V).<br>  <br>  If you go to a lower speed rating sometimes the tires make the car feel wobbly when you switch lanes due to the sidewall being thinner.<br>  <br>  Simply stated you need to stay the same size and the same speed rating for best performance.<br>  <br>  If you would like more information about tires here is a good link<br>  <br>  www.tirerack.com <br>  <br>  Amazing how Mark F who works in the tire industry can't point you to one of the most widely used tire reference guides on the web.|`|qjtzjC7Vaa	Tirerack lists tires from $86 and up per tire for this car. If you don't like the Michelins why did you buy them three times in a row. Most cars these days have low profile tires similar in size to the S40.|`|0T7vYxrzaa	Mark F is right, you can't change the size, but I'm sure you can find a less expensive tire than Michelin that fits.|`|sSw10X1Laa	sadly?<br>  i think the s40 is a fine car.
srQZg269aa	I passed my test last October so the best advice I can give you is to stay calm and try to focus on the road ahead, looking not only for hazards but also for potential hazards (ie. things that can turn into hazards pretty quickly).<br>  <br>  Listen carefully to the instructor's directions and break down what he wants you to do in stages and remember your M-S-M's.<br>  <br>  If you don't get it this time, keep practicing and get booked in again (not that you'll need it of course!) to avoid breaking out of the habit of prepping for the test!<br>  <br>  All the best as it's a life changing moment when the instructor tells you that you've passed!

Then hammer a cheap drill bit in there and snap off the excess. Tried and tested by many bikers and it works very well.<br>  <br>  This is assuming that 1) it's the splines on the shaft that are screwed, if it's the splines on the lever simply get a new one. 2) That the lever shaft can't be easily replaced.

E0j6mhqhaa	6000 km round trip, that's less than 4,000 miles.  If you can't get that many miles out of a set of tires, you need to stay home because riding crazy enough to burn up tires in that time is going to get you killed.  Since I seriously doubt you're that stupid, here's a few things I've learned over the years.<br>  <br>  Get some good sunscreen and even if in cool weather, you will want to apply it to your face, lips and neck.  Believe me, nothing worse than badly sunburned lips.  Bring along a long sleeve shirt for sun protection as well as a heavier jacket and gloves.  Weather has a way of changing abruptly shortly after you leave on your trip.  If packing space is short, figure a clean shirt and underwear everyday, socks every two days and jeans every three days with a minimum of two pair.  That extra pair will come in handy even if they are dirty should you get caught in a downpour.  Keep in mind that you can always stop at a laundromat and wash your clothes and that extra pair of jeans lets you wash clothes without standing around in your underwear.<br>  <br>  Before you go, consider changing spark plugs is you have a number of miles on them, make sure your tires have adequate tread remaining, check the air pressure in them and change the engine oil.  If you have chain drive, carry along chain lube inside of a zip lock plastic bag to keep it from leaking on other things.  Also stick a washrag and bar of soap in another bag or some pre-moistened towelettes just in case you get your hands dirty along the way.  Once you get dirt and grease on your handgrips, it keeps dirtying up your hands.<br>  <br>  While not necessary, a cell phone does provide a sense of security.  Bring along a camera even if it is a disposable one.  Plan on stopping often to look around and stretch your legs.  A number of short breaks is preferable to one long one.  Remember that it's not how far you go but what you see along the way that counts.  If you have the desire, take along a small note book and keep a diary for later reference.  Also remember that what ever doesn't kill you makes for a good story later.|`|AA10582974	Touring essentials: Don't leave home without 'em -<br>  <a href="http://www.amadirectlink.com/roadride/riderresc/TouringTips.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.amadirectlink.com/roadride/ri...</a><br>  Lots off advice -<br>  <a href="http://www.amadirectlink.com/roadride/Riderresc/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.amadirectlink.com/roadride/Ri...</a>|`|98NiEivhaa	Have all your maintenance up to snuff and plan your maintenance stop on the way, cause in 6000km, you're going to need at least an oil change.  no sense bringing a bunch of tools or where do you quit?  changing a tire on the road on a bike isn't very feasible, buy a roadside assistance membership that covers towing in case you need it... not sure what australia offers but I'm sure you have some sort of equivalent to CAA/AAA|`|f8240cd0e6b54863a050b702a65c786caa	As long as you are satisfied the bike is in reliable condition, the only problem should be getting the smile off your face.<br>  Depending on your maintenance schedule, you may change the oil before you go, so you know you won't have to worry about it on the trip.

1bobsT4Kaa	If ur talking about the tires to the rims, then yes definitely take it to a shop. the computer will know how much it will take to balance the tire you cant do that by eye. but as far as the alignment you dont need it know, well unless your car pulls to the side already. Eventually yeah because there is now more contact surface from the tires to the ground meaning more pressure on you axles, and alignment.  Call a couple of shops just to make sure though.|`|0T7vYxrzaa	What year/make/model of car, what size and offet are the wheels and what size are the tires?
a0565811de871e19a5c2a7b27aeadf50aa	The 2002 is definitely rarer and therefore, more collectible.  So much so, that BMW AG built a one-off version in "Inka Orange" in the public eye a couple of years ago.  This resurrection created quite a sensation on the streets of Munich.<br>  <br>  In the US, the 2002 was the model that caused Americans to sit up and take notice of this car maker in the early 1970's.  With 4 passengers and their luggage aboard, this boxy-looking car was capable of running circles around Mustangs, Camaros, and other muscle cars of the era.  Auto writers termed the 2002 a "pocket rocket, Q-ship, and whispering bomb".  It was truly a great machine.|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	I believe the 2002 Turbo is more of a prized possession than the E30 M3 would be. There's barely any of them around any more.|`|HZ9qmD6oaa	BMW 2002 is more 'rare'. Both are equally collected, although there are a lot more E30 M3's then there are 2002's.

wra8Q7O3aa	Turbo'ing an automatic transmission is a no-no. You're going to break your transmission really fast with a turbo on the car. That transmission was not meant to hold up a lot of power. It would be better to start swapping or upgrading the the manual transmission instead. You don't want to spend 3k-4k on a turbo kit. Then couple days later, your transmission breaks down. Then spend another 3k-4k on the transmission. Plus most turbo kits are made for manual transmission anyways. If you want one locally, its going to be a pain to find a legitmate one... or even find one. Its better to call a local tuning shop and get a custom made one instead, if your not going to buy one online. Overall, its going to be expensive from where your starting at. But everything is possible with a lot and loads of cash "on hand". From my personal opinion, I would ditch the car and trade it in for something that has more potiential and at least a stick shift if I would to hook it up with a turbo kit later on.|`|GFqt7Eawaa	dont waste your time.. no offense but theres only so much you can do with your lancer before something bad happens like the engine blows up because of too much pressure from the turbo kit..and the labor to install it is going to be very expensive.. or if you do it yourself it will take for ever and there will be fuel/electronic problems galore. look to trade in your lancer for a older style eclipse a gst or gsx comes turboed from factory and is a better value than a lancer overall!!|`|ExLehjBgaa	Yes....you sell it and buy a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution which is factory turbocharged.|`|Ndgw28K6aa	just buy an evo ix mr - its factory tuned with twin turbo instead of stock evo ix and will propa go like the wind!|`|e93659642a9147aad2a89d7b0a52ebddaa	How about save the money and convert the car to a manual and actually start driving.<br>  <br>  Edit: Any kit you get is going to be outrageously expensive anyway (for your car depending on the size of the turbo of course you're looking around 4-5k). Look into components instead. If you go that way and then have it all put together you can easily save thousands.

KQhIcU4Yaa	Corrosion is a term usually referring to the loss of metal due to electrochemical processes.. There are different types of corrosion: oxidation, galvanic, pitting, crevice and microbial corrosion are common types that occur at low temperatures.<br>  <br>  Sea water influences corrosion in two main ways, first of all the salt in sea water makes it better at conducting electrons away from the metal, thus making it more corrosive.  The high chlorides in sea water also make it worse for crevice corrosion in stainless steels.<br>  <br>  The reactions are difficult to write in the formatting allowed.  See the first source link for how a corrosion cell reacts in water.<br>  <br>  Where corrosion affects a recreational boat is mainly on the metal parts that are below the water line.  These parts are made of corrosion resistant metals and also use anodic protection to control corrosion.<br>  <br>  Anodic protection works by putting a less corrosion resistant metal in contact with the parts to be protected.  The less corrosion resistant metal becomes the anode, forcing the other metal to be the cathode, preventing attack.  In this way, the less corrosion resistant metal is sacrificed to protect the rest of the parts.  Sacrificial anodes are made from zinc or magnesium.  A representation of this is shown in the second source link.|`|17fc2b122418131f22f55073029bb3b5aa	Corrosion means the breaking down of essential properties in a material due to chemical reactions with its surroundings. In the most common use of the word, this means a loss of electrons of metals reacting with water and oxygen. Weakening of iron due to oxidation of the iron atoms is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion. This is commonly known as rusting. This type of damage typically produces oxide(s) and/or salt(s) of the original metal. Corrosion can also refer to the degradation of ceramic materials as well as the discoloration and weakening of polymers by the sun's ultraviolet light.|`|qczTENowaa	Rust was once explained to me as a very slow burning fire...<br>  <br>  Worst than rust is electrolysis<br>  <br>  If you ever chewed on aluminum foil, you will feel the effects of electrolysis in your mouth, on your fillings  - OUCH <br>  <br>  Electrolysis destroys your prop, boat, and anything metal that is below the water line.  Make sure you have a good zinc plate and you'll be okay.

It was easy to do but if you have an older car, I would leave it.  You may not only have some discoloration but I have seen people pull the paint off the trunk too.  In the end it's personal preference.  Not everyone buys an STI so that everyone else knows they drive one.  That's a little sad of a reason to leave it on.
Q2wdm3spaa	You don't say whether the stretch is in frame or swingarm. One of the things you want to look at is trail, which is more involved than rake. Rake is the angle of the steering head on the frame, and trail is the relationship of the angle of your forks to the point the tire touches the ground. You can have a pretty severe rake and handle well, if the trail is correct.  Several websites explain this better than I can, so I'd suggest Googling rake and trail and reading up on it. If you're gonna go custom, it'll be time well spent.|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	Which bit is stretched, a stretched swingarm won't affect the rake but it will affect handling – especially in corners however a longer wheelbase should be more stable. Longer forks will affect the rake.|`|4r91z1zmaa	Yes, in most situations.  If the swingarm is stretched, it changes things unless the swingarm is parallel to the ground.  Usually adding to the swingarm will raise the back of the bike, unless a compensation is made to counter the effect, like lowering.<br>  <br>  Changing rake affects handling alot.
YiY9Yd2Jaa	It will depend on all manner of things. To start with, if you simply increase power you will have prop cavitation, not the boat going faster.  The gearing, the prop pitch and diameter all have to be modified as well. <br>  As for increasing power, the conventional methods will not all suit as that motor was for premium leaded fuel, so upping compression etc., will be problematic if you are trying to use unleaded. Adding a turbocharger is the simplest method, but not cheap. Maybe you should look at fitting a more modern and more powerful motor from a wrecking yard - it would probably be cheaper and more efficient in the long run. Those alloy V8's that are used in Rovers, Landrovers etc., are often used to replace the old red motor. Much more power and lighter to boot.|`|VdJRuTIRaa	wow i havn't seen one of these engines for a long time!!<br>  the easiest bolt on stuff is to<br>  bolt on a 173 head the port size and valves are the same size but the cc combustion size is smaller and that will raise the compression.and<br>  with the carbie if you have some triple SU's off the xu1 they will do the job but they are extremely hard to tune and keep in tune, so if you grab yourself a redline manifold and a 350 holley carbie from ebay, that will make your life heaps easier when tuning it. And then find yourself a electronic distributor from a blue or black commodore 202 engine, one of these will give your spark a hell of a kick and then a set of  extractors (not headers) headers are for down low power and extractors are for top end power, these minor modifications are very cheap and the whole lot should be under $500 bucks.|`|wCf5iFqCaa	octane booster! its cheap and easy as hell

With decent turbo's and coolers you can easy screw 400+ bhp out of a 2ltr 4 cyl. Would never get that with a supercharger.|`|1bobsT4Kaa	Well its about prefference i guess. Superchargers are belt driven an make power faster, but turbos build power by retaining exhaust fumes, well something like that hence the name turbo lag. Turbos run cooler supposedly, from what i've searched myself. The choice is off the line fast or top end. As far as turbos if you have the money try garret (I had a couple cheaper ones an had a garret an loved it! never looked back since), but superchargers either blitz or jackson racing, just depends on what ur running as far as your make of car matched with availability.|`|ktrruPfNaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	Along with the valid answers above, you forget the fact that if required, the bird can still generate lift by flapping. A stalling aircraft has no such luxury and it will be unwise to stall an aircraft near the ground.<br>  <br>  Interesting thought though!|`|bxlYleZkaa	When we are able to fly half as well as birds maybe we will be somewhere near trying to land like them. I think we have a few million years of R&D to do yet!|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Perhaps they could … but it's hard to see any practical value in doing so.  Aircraft are already much better at flying than birds are, at least for the purposes to which aircraft are put.|`|swiOhDo2aa	Hardly. The relatively fast low approach is in reality only a few miles/hour. The stall is produced by a quite dramatic alteration in the wing geometry and wing-body angle. If it were possible to scale this up to passenger jet speeds (and it probably is not practical engineering) the abrupt deceleration and high g-force at the last moment would cause at least discomfort, probably serious injury, for crew and passengers. High approach speeds (of around, say, 300 knots) followed by a rearing up of the nose and a sudden drop in speed to  zero would also stress the airframe, probably terminally.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, the landing technique you advocate has something in common with that in use before nosewheels were fitted. The aircraft was then flown down to the runway at just above stalling speed, and stalled on purpose as close as possible to the surface to achieve a nose-up 3-point landing. However, deceleration was gentle and a long runway was still needed for this. It is also possible to land using a bird-like technique in a hang-glider, but again, the speeds are very low.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|532deab779a2372a57081cb9271a0d97aa	I would say the most damning portion of this idea is the beating a plane would take upon dropping to the deck. Aircraft don't like this they need to be heavily reinforced in there frames and components to handle the banging. The greatest example is to be seen in the pounding done to naval planes even these beefed up planes only last half as long as the more gently handled air force planes. So there is no gain in this idea. However I do know of some planes that already do this but they are very small example would be the german made storch of WW2 it landed gently by the stall method and had lots of flaps to give it STOL capabilities.|`|SwdWPAmBaa	not really...birds have full mobility of their entire 'control surfaces', where as aircraft only rely on small hinged flaps such as ailerons and elevators - which doesnt give enough effective control at lower speeds (when "stalling" to land)<br>  <br>  it could be possible, but such aircraft id imagine would be too heavy, too expensive and with too much stuff to go wrong.<br>  <br>  besides the only useful field applicable would be military aviation, and since vertical take off and landing is demonstrated good enough for production, there would be no need for such an aircraft.|`|da59b44452c599e7a03e6a7a72f23754aa	No.<br>  <br>  Although... In the early days of aircraft carriers and jets, The British experimented with a landing technique where the pilot did something similar by going in steep then deliberately stalling the aircraft when it was over the carrier's deck. A matress-like device was rolled out which would 'catch' the plane, which would have it's landing gear up. It wasn't a success, as the resulting 'bounce' couldn't be accurately controlled.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	We already have jets capable of vertical take off and landing, I imagine they can approach as fast as they like before manouvering their thrusters to slow and then drop to the ground.|`|0Pkup44haa	Not quite, but kind of....<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt43RHyyt_A" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt43RHyyt...</a>|`|6R9Kqaudaa	i've always thought that a helicopter landing is similar to a bird landing, isn't it?

QcENsfCEaa	You have 3 options none of them good. 1.Have it repossessed 2. sale it. 3. Have an accident and if you do that you better have gap insurance. There is no way to cancel a contract or return the car. The dealer can do nothing unless its a buy here pay here store. Selling it would be the best and legal option the repo will affect your credit for 7 years.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	You can't. You are contractually obligated to repay the money you borrowed. You can't just cancel a valid contract because you changed your mind or whatever. You can give the car back, which is a repossession, but you will still owe the remaining amount of your loan. The debt will not go away.<br>  <br>  Your options are sell the car and pay off the loan with the money, keep the car and continue making payments, or return the car and suffer the legal and financial consequences.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Unfortunately, that is not an option. You can sell the vehicle, pay off the loan, and you are then no longer responsible for it, but that is the only option you have. You cannot cancel a financing contract unless your state has a 3 day contract recension law, but that only applies if you've had the car for less than 3 days.<br>  <br>  Selling it is therefore your only option.|`|TbiSBXclaa	The scenario you present is impossible. Dealers don't accept returns and Banks don't "cancel" financing on a car.   You are contractually obligated to pay off the loan. <br>  <br>  Even if you have the car reposessed it does not relieve you of your responsibility of paying off the bank.  You still owe the money to the bank you just lose the priviledge of driving a car that you aren't paying for/can't pay for.<br>  <br>  Your only option is to sell the car and pay off the debt to the bank.|`|RbsRpcIyaa	Most of the above are correct: You do not have the option of returning the vehicle and cancelling the contract. Some dealers have a return policy, but there is no law allowing you to cancel your contract.<br>  <br>  Some folks will come on here and say you have 3 days, 30 days, 90 days, etc... however, those do not apply to vehicle sales.|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	The dealer has nothing to do with it after the contract is cashed. The finance company paid the dealer for your car, and he used that money to buy another car to replace yours. It's between you and the finance company at this point, and they don't want your car, either. All they want is to be paid back the money they gave the dealer. I suggest trying to sell the car and using the money to pay back the loan. Good luck...it sounds like you're gonna need it.|`|1H7aNVT3aa	You won't be able to do it.  A contract is binding.  You'll have to sell the car and pay the note.
e9W9g5tzaa	NO they will not. The 2000 wheels are machined flat and use a spring washer on the nut for clamping pressure and are metric while the 1970 use SAE thread lugs and use a conical seat and conical nuts. Using the wrong style of wheel and nut can overstress the lugs and snap them off causing you to lose a wheel while driving.
AA10283947	Buy a Haynes manual for the car, it will always be useful.<br>  this will explain how to get the shield out of the way.<br>  Its usually assessed by removing the right front wheel (WHEN viewed sitting in the car) there will be screws and clips to remove the plastic and then you will observe the drain nut.<br>  Always replace the copper washer with a new one and tighten to the correct torque, buy this washer before you begin the job from a motor factors.|`|c48nm70gaa	Your handbook in the glove compartment will show you the access hole or how to remove the pain in the butt shield under the motor.|`|I3CNklLKaa	Get the Haynes manual.|`|cD6vC0YOaa	Start the car and allow to run until warm (the old oil will flow out better than cold. Working from underneath, the plastic covers should be secured by 4-6 Phillips/crosshead screws (might be hidden by oil/dirt) once these are removed the plastic can be easily removed, you will then see the bottom of the oil sump. Right at the very bottom of the sump you`ll see the sump plug - a 17mm hex-head bolt. It will be quite tight so be careful when you unscrew, make sure you have a large container directly underneath to catch the old oil!!! Oh, and try not to lose the brass washer on the bolt!!!

uH32skl3aa	This is a tuff one. I have a2003 Liberty sport and I have Cherokees. But I have had Grands.  The Grand Cherokees just seem like alot more to go wrong to me. What do you plan on doing with it?  The liberty is alot of fun to drive, very peppy and quick stering.  The down falls for the liberty are 15MPG and a bit higher on the highway, It has CV shafts and I would not take mine down anything more then a dirt road.  A Cherokee I would take anywhere with solid axles and no CV shafts. The Grand will ride alot better and have alot more creature comforts and with that engine I would guess better MPG,  In a liberty if your driving on wet and slippery roads don,t play.  With the short wheel base they will do a 360 in a heart beat.  On snow covered roads always put it in 4 wheel drive!   You can fish tail a cherokee and play a little, (there very forgiving)   with the longer wheel base.   I would never put a young driver in a Liberty in the winter.

O86dnuQuaa	Is it getting power at the attachment leads? If so, the grid itself could have a crack preventing it from working.
oBcxjj5Baa	John B gave you the very right answer. The indicator  is a plastic nylon switch just beneath the steering wheel. You may first have to undo it first to reach the switch, most probably it is worn out. If so, just replace it, sometime the small steel ball is dislocated even in that case you have to buy a new switch, have a look if the spring is broken. Any way, it is not an expensive part. Just replace it and you will be OK.|`|MQPJ2UaGaa	The indicator switch in the steering column is one of the parts <br>  that is worth buying new,they are made of plastic and get hard<br>  and brittle after a while this will be the same with a used one.<br>    You will have to remove the steering wheel to change.|`|7ciw1aCXaa	Yes. I got a spare from a breakers yard, but I've just put that to one side, as it is OK for now.<br>  Depending on how old your car is, and what make it is, you could try following the Haynes manual instructions for removing the switch unit, then lubricate the moving parts with a little clear grease. I repaired a lighting switch on a Vauxhall Viva C that way, and I was surprised at how much you could actually dismantle the switch, right down to the copper contacts and springs. More modern cars, I suspect, would have sealed units.|`|X16keVc1aa	You did not say what make of car you have. - I bet its a Citroen/Renault or Fiat. This is a common problem with these cars.<br>  <br>  Just replace the column switch and it should solve the problem|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	I would recommend going to a "car breakers" and finding the same model car and get a good working replacement, est cost ￡10.

yCWjBrjnaa	It's a bit tricky. I'm no expert by any means, but I know that an ordinary assisted electric bike which does away with the need for pedalling and doesn't go very fast is quite legal. However some forms of powered transport are not legal for use on anything other than private land, like segways (shame, cos I'd love one!) , motorized foot scooters, and I know the speed can make a difference. That is actually going to be the biggest hurdle - whether something is legal to use on the road or not. Maybe checking out the DVLA website might help.|`|YP6zpBxaaa	GSXRdad, so segways aren't legal on public land in the UK?

For those of you that need info check out this site.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myrtlebeachbikeweek.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.myrtlebeachbikeweek.com/</a><br>  <br>  Here are a couple quotes from that site...<br>  <br>  The City of Myrtle Beach passed restrictive ordinances targeting the May rallies, which brought tens of thousands of visitors (tourist) to the city.   The City of Myrtle Beach has never been a sponsor or host of Bike Week.  These new ordinances apply ONLY inside the City Limits of Myrtle Beach.   <br>  ***  There are no events (vendors) inside the city limits.  <br>  ***  All events (vendors) are outside the city in Horry County, Murrells Inlet or North Myrtle Beach.  <br>  <br>        No Events Cancelled -- All Outside the City of Myrtle Beach <br>  As many of you have heard or received information on the events being cancelled.  Not exactly true - The events will take place in the County and surrounding Counties just not inside of the City of Myrtle Beach.   The City of Myrtle Beach has begun a media campaign designed to deter the respectable, law abiding motorcycle enthusiast from coming to the area.   There are businesses inside the City limits of Myrtle Beach that do support and welcome Motorcycle Enthusiast.    The City of Myrtle Beach can't stop you from visiting and supporting the businesses that support Bike Week.  Looking forward to seeing everyone again in 2009.|`|b3bc76bf01815fa490acfdd8f96d1fffaa	As a local Myrtle Beach resident I think most people will stay away. <br>  The city really didn't think this idea through. After watching the local news yesterday, several "bikers" stated they would not come down bike week or any other time of the year. I think it's horrible that the city is targeting people who choose a motorcycle as their transportation. There is a rally this weekend opposing the new laws, get on those bikes and come on down! Bikers will be riding up to the Myrtle Beach city limit. <br>  <br>  The businesses at Broadway at the Beach that do enjoy the bikers will definitely be hurt. Several Motorcycle shops have already closed down. This is bigger than what people think. It is hurting our local economy Big Time!|`|lgNfXk9Qaa	You might check to be sure,but I read where it has been cancelled.I read it on two different websites.

I guess that you have one that's broken, and a second one you want to use to replace it.   Give us the engine model and sr.   and we can try to check if it's the same HP and which gears are in that drive.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ok, I'll do a little more research but I'm almost sure the gear ratio is different, but check the number of splines on  the drive shaft and propeller.....and the length of the shaft.  If they match-up see if it will bolt-up and try it, keep the rpm low, and see how the drive acts.   I'd guess less power but who knows. Good luck!

And not some dinky moped either -- a big, angry-looking thing, just parked right there sneering at our white minivan.<br>  <br>  I ran upstairs, shocked. And in the kitchen, both my parents were laughing at me.<br>  <br>  "Yes, we did think it was pretty funny the way you said 'Holy s**t, there's a bike in the garage!' Poor Sanden looked so astonished!"<br>  <br>  OK. That's my mom. And I was astonished. Because it was her bike. <br>  <br>  All my life, she was the one lecturing me about thinking through my actions. And here she was with the keys to some crotch rocket -- all because of a midlife crisis. <br>  <br>  Whatever. The point was, motorcycles are dangerous. Every day, an average of 12 Americans wipe out riding one of these deathtraps. And buying one is the kind of impulsive, irresponsible thing I'd expect from someone young and stupid -- like me. Not my mom.<br>  <br>  "It certainly was an impulse," my mom says. "But I don't think it was that irresponsible. And I was very careful about how I did things. I wore way more protection than most people would."<br>  <br>  Mom makes a good point -- she did get everything from a full face helmet to fireproof socks. But any way you look at it, this was a big decision. What gave her the right to just do this on her own, without even consulting her family?<br>  <br>  "I had earned the right to do that. I also felt I denied myself for a long time for the sake of my children and my family," she says. "And things were reasonably settled, and I deserved it. I actually bought something that was fun for me."<br>  <br>  All right, I can't argue with that. And truthfully, she was going to ride this thing no matter what I said. My only hope was that it was just a passing phase.<br>  <br>  It wasn't a passing phase.<br>  <br>  My mom bought a full leather outfit. She started cutting the sleeves off her T-shirts. She even joined a biker gang.<br>  <br>  Okay, it was a biker gang for doctors and lawyers, so less six-packs and brass knuckles and more briefcases and bifocals. But still, it was kind of cool. My mom was like Peter Fonda in "Easy Rider" -- except short, middle-aged and wearing lipstick.<br>  <br>  And she was having fun -- it was happiest I'd seen her in years. So when she announced to our family that she was going to take a cross-country trip on her bike, I decided to show her some support. I asked to ride along on the back.<br>  <br>  Of course she said yes -- she's my mom. So we packed up our stuff in two saddlebags and hit the open road.<br>  <br>  We started on the West Coast. It was summer. Mom remembers the heat:<br>  <br>  "Really hot! Like 105, 110 at least!"<br>  <br>  But when we reached the Rockies, things cooled down. Her bike was pretty powerful, so we had no trouble climbing those hills. We passed some amazing scenery as we were swooping and swooshing down the roadway. Things got more exciting as we started heading down, down, down towards Denver. We hit the city and cruised through to the other side and then... nothing. It was flat and boring for miles.<br>  <br>  We rode on late into the night without stopping, and before we knew it we ran out of gas. This didn't phase my mom, though. She just parked the bike and we went out in the middle of a deserted field -- and just looked up at the stars. <br>  <br>  My mom told about how when she was my age, she use to dream of crossing the country like in the book "On the Road." This trip kind of fulfilled that dream for her. <br>  <br>  "I was very proud. I was very happy to be doing that," she says. "It felt so good that you and I were sharing similar interests and a little adventure together."<br>  <br>  Then, the accident. <br>  <br>  It was a couple months later. My mom was heading to work one day and the bike slid out from under her in the middle of a turn. She survived it OK, but her knee was busted pretty badly and the bike was totaled. <br>  <br>  Now here's the point where I should have freaked out. I should have put my foot down and said: "Mom, no more motorcycles! It's time to give it up!" <br>  <br>  But the truth was, I didn't want to see her give it up. I had gotten used to this new mom. Biking gave her a purpose, it gave her confidence and it gave her a life outside of just her job and her family. <br>  <br>  Two month later, she bought a new bike. This one was even bigger and shinier than the first. Before I knew it, she was back on the road. And you know what? I've realized I'm okay with that... as long as she wears her helmet.|`|BVaCJkxzaa	Motorcycles are not dangerous. People are.

7ciw1aCXaa	No. There are different grades of tyre and the more rugged they are, e.g. designed for 4x4 & offroad use, the more resilient they will be. You can get 'run-flat' tyres that have strong enough side-walls to allow you to drive at a reduced speed for 40-50 miles, which is enough to get you to a garage in most of the UK. Special protection service vehicles often have run-flats and self-reinflation devices, but they are very expensive.<br>  The only other 'un-puncturable' tyre that you will get is e.g. a solid tyre from a very old vintage car. But then, that's not really a 'tyre' is it? More of a 'wheel'.|`|MQPJ2UaGaa	Uniroyal tried this back in the late 70's with a tire called the<br>  Royalseal,They had a gummy coating inside to seal around <br>  a nail or other object that had puntured the tire,they were<br>  unsuccessful due to the fact that they would not shed heat<br>  and would fall apart from overheating.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Is this a challenge?  I bet a .50 cal BMG round will go through any tire that can be made.<br>  <br>  Seriously, the answer is no.  But there are tires that you can continue to drive, for 40-50 miles, even with no pressure.  They're called run-flats.|`|eHS37mjQaa	no, but i believe that there are some that if they get punctured you can drive x many miles before they go flat.
Fr6GdIQ3aa	1. Have you tried adjusting the dash brightness with the knob? (usually located at the driver's left knee area).<br>  <br>  2.

One thing that is for sure, a wider tire is that much more you have to lean in a corner.|`|4r91z1zmaa	Contrary to the 'Due May 1st!!' statement, a wider tire will affect traction because the larger footprint provides a larger contact surface.  Wider tire=more rubber on the road=more traction.<br>  <br>  To answer your question considering just the tire, it will decrease your chance of wiping out.  It will provide more traction straight-line and when leaning in a turn.  To compare the tire sizes, go to the shop and ask to see one of each size you are considering.  Lean each one over and see how far each goes while maintaining tread contact.|`|YP6zpBxaaa	the chances of the bike just falling over? it'll decrease that.  the chances that the bike will go where you tell it to?  it'll decrease that, too.  keep in mind that factory japanese bikes with more power than your chopper run 190-200 series tires.|`|QmBEyD4paa	A wider tire means you have to lean much more in the corner.

It really depends on skill level.<br>  2. wet or dry payvement.<br>  3 Compound of the rubber.<br>  4 Tread design on the tire.<br>  5 Air pressure. <br>  6 One or two people on the bike.<br>  7 A second persons skill level on being a rider.<br>  8 Proper rim design.<br>  9 Tread depth.<br>  10 Side wall stiffness.<br>  11. Weight of bike.<br>  <br>  It`s un believable  how many things affect a tire.<br>  <br>  However Lets say you change a tires width from 4 inches wide to a tire 10 inches wide and all other things stay exactly the same. Then on the exact same dry pavement in the exact same location your bike would have more traction on the 10 inch tire than it did on the 4 inch tire. But now spray the pavement with water. You may be better off with the 4 inch tire in that it could have more water treading ability. Tires are a critical part of any vehicle and no two tires are the same. <br>  Also the bigger you go on the rear of the bike the more push you are going to cause yourself in the front end of your bike. If your ridding a chopper with the forks way out there it will be even more pronounced.<br>  I would suggest you contacting some one with a bike real similar to yours that has gone where you are thinking of going in the tire department and ask them how tire bike responded to the change. My friend what should ba a simple tire change can turn out to be a real can of worms. Do some research before spending your cash

Jwk7Ib2vaa	I had a truck that my nephews and I always took long road trips in. What we had was an 8" flip down t.v. that had RCA hookups. This meant that the kids could hookup their gaming systems and play together as opposed to them fighting over what movie to watch or whatever. The t.v.'s in the headrest are much more expensive and require longer time for install which in turn means more $$. <br>  The flip down also meant that it could be a bigger screen, being that most headrests are tiny compared to the space in the cabin of your van. A bigger t.v. means the kids wont have to squint to watch it and it wont be right in front of their faces which could damage their eyes over time. <br>  The flip down only cost about $175 total. This included the television (from the local pawn shop/swap shop/flea market etc) and professional install from any local audio place. I knew t.v. was name brand, but someone sold it to a pawn shop so their loss was my gain.<br>  hope this helps!

mggll8dRaa	New Cars say it's not necessary, but make sure the defrosters are all working before driving....!!|`|BnR4LLhxaa	For the most part - it is not at all necessary to idle your car in order to warm it up. If it is very cold, single digits and below, then letting it idle for a minute or two is fine. The practice of starting a car and letting it idle for a long time to warm up wastes a lot of fuel and does not benefit the car (no matter how pleasant it is for the owner).<br>  <br>  The best way to warm up a car is to drive at moderate speeds for the first 10-15 minutes. Not a good idea to start up and immediately hit 70mph.|`|XpKY04Tnaa	Warm up is not necessary with modern automobiles. The electronics will take care of all the necessary fuel, air, and ignition changes needed for cold weather starts. <br>  <br>  On the other hand I wouldn't stress the engine until it was properly warmed up. Racing or pulling heavy loads. You could possibly blow out a gasket when the engine block is cold and hasn't expanded to tighten the gasket seals.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	in super cold weather it's best to let the car warm up for no more than 3 minutes, any other time there is no need to warm it up.|`|vzIEn14zaa	There are a few theories around this but basically the one I live by is: you shouldnt let your car warm up too much at all before driving.  <br>  <br>  Reason:<br>  <br>  Your engine is only one component of your drive system.  When you let your engine warm up the fluids in your entire system are not up to the same level as your engine.  Many people who let their cars warm up think since their engine is warm they are ready for the races and start going like normal.  The reality is your transmission fluid and differential fluid have not had any warm up time.  <br>  <br>  If you just get in start it up and drive then ALL your systems begin to warm up at the same time.  If your engine/car is cold you will take it easier, accelerate lighter.  Once your car is warmed up on the road you can be assured that all your other fluid systems are warm as well when you start to accelerate harder.<br>  <br>  Letting the car warm up for your personal comfort is fine, I am not suggesting you will harm your engine by letting it warm up.  You just need to know when you start driving that you need to take it easy for the first few Kilometers/Miles until the rest of your system has also come up to temperature.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	Yes warming up a car is good for your engine and should be done when you live in areas with freezing temperatures. Your mileage will still go down because A. winter gas is slightly less efficient. B. The computer mapping will use more gas when the temperature is cold. and C. Your car will idol longer when you let it warm up.<br>  <br>  Why you should let it warm up.<br>  There are a couple of reasons. Think firstly of the oil. When the oil gets cold, it gets thicker, and therefore doesn't lubricate the parts in your engine as well. If you imediatly put strain on those parts by asking them to work hard, you damage your internal components of the engine. If you let the engine get up to operating temperature, you minimize these damaging effects by allowing the engine to become well lubricated before you put a load on it and ask it to do work.<br>  <br>  When the seals are cold there is less efficiency in the combustion chamber, as the seals warm, get lubricated, they expand slightly and the efficiency of the burn increases.<br>  <br>  Lastly, when a car is at operating temperature, you minimize the amount of pollution you put into the air. When you ask a car to do work, (aka put it in drive and hit the gas) more pollution is created. If the catalytic converter is not hot, it will not effectivly do it's job to remove the pollution coming out of the engine. As a result it's best to let the engine idol and not do alot of work until it gets to operating temperature, that way your minimizing your impact on the environment. (who would have thought letting your car idol would help things, lol)<br>  As far as time, it really depeds on the outside temperature. you can look at your water temp gauge and wait until it gets to operating temperature, or if you find that takes too long you can wait until your getting heat coming out of your air vents. Once that's hot you know that your engine might not be right up to temp, but it's getting close and wont hurt to drive. A general rule of thumb is that it will take somewhere between 5 and 15 minutes. Longer than 15 isn't going to help anything. 5 is good for days that are not too cold. Hope that helps :)|`|yzZchHHTaa	Depending on age of car.  Some will tell you about 30 seconds...apparently they don't live where there is ice and snow.  I let mine warm up until the windshield is clear enough to drive, then I go.  Most times about 2-5 minutes, sometimes 10.<br>  I have a remote start that lets the engine run for 15 minutes then shuts off.  Somedays it runs that long depending on how much time I need to chase kids down and get them ready for school.|`|TWsxP46Qaa	depends on engine size,here in the UK i recommend 10 minutes for engines under 2 litres and 15 minutes for anything larger,in easy terms if your engine is a 4 cylinder give it ten if its a v6 or a v8 give it 15<br>  <br>  and it will improve efficiancy ,it gives the engine,gearbox(transmission),differentia... fluids time to warm to a decent operating temp before you make them take the strain of driving|`|j1XQDnohaa	You should let it warm up for a few minutes, usually about 5-6. You don't have to wait until the car is fully warmed up but driving with a completely cold engine will kill your gas mileage. But if you let it warm up for too long you will also waste gas so don't warm it up for too long.|`|C2JR6CRxaa	It is a good thing to  lease let the temp to come up a little on the Gauge.  As far as your gas mileage some states put additives in the gas which will reduce you mpg to improve the air quality.|`|285b98a01876e1a83f6a503f40258aa6aa	Warming up for 3 to 5 minutes is good for the engine and helps get the defroster working.

tUYkerS9aa	Yes, I think transport fares should definitely be reduced to reflect the economic situation. The taxi business, like expensive restaurants, is one a the first casualties of a recession,  for many it is an unnecessary expense. And being on "piece work" you rely on the work for your wages.<br>  <br>  As you rightfully say why should you have to sit in your taxi waiting for customers who cannot afford you.

TdrgZwnoaa	I have been strapping myself into cars for over 40 years. The very idea of not wearing a seat belt makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and if you are not a seat belt wearer you do not travel in my car. I have been in two serious automobile accidents and seats belts were a major contributor to the fact that I am alive to tell of it.<br>   And I am not above calling anyone that doesn't wear seat belts an '''effing''' idiot.|`|siHN027laa	Well, all the replies so far are certainly good and valid. But one more and different reason to wear them is public liability.  So you choose not to wear one and are involved in an accident. You are severely injured and are paralyzed. Your insurance can't, won't cover all the expenses but you still have to be cared for.  Who foots the bill?  The public will, one way or the other.<br>  That's the major reason helmet laws came into being in CA.  Too many helmetless riders were getting cared for on public monies and the citizens finally got it on the ballot and voted on it.<br>  It wasn't anything to do with thinking of saving their lives, or eliminating pain and suffering for relatives and friends. All about costs that others incur because of the acts of others.|`|GIFCh6Ccaa	it is a question of privacy and personal rights.  <br>  <br>  yes, everyone should wear one... no, we should not legislate what you do.  the only reason that seat belts are a law is that the insurance industry has a powerful lobby.  <br>  <br>  forcing people to do something, or not to do something, that does not affect public safety or health is an invasion of privacy.  no matter how many good reasons there are to wear one, forcing it on them is a step away from freedom through gov't interference.<br>  <br>  btw, i wear one and require all in my car to do so before i move.|`|nDSLNnguaa	I always wear my seat belt and make my children wear theirs.  I think it's just part of being a responsible driver. <br>  <br>  The one time I didn't wear my seat belt (I had just stopped by the pharmacy to have my husband's pain meds filled on the way home from surgery- I had not put it on yet as I was trying to tell him his sister called) I was pulled over and got a ticket!|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Common sense should tell you to wear one, but the law says you have to. I grew up and learned to drive before using seatbelts was mandatory. Nobody used seat belts when I was a kid. It was hard to get used to using them, but it's just automatic now.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Wearing your seat-belts saves your life and the many people that you love and care for.....|`|Fr6GdIQ3aa	Well unless you live in the state of NH, you dont have a choice. By law you are required to wear a seatbelt. (There may be states that allow rear-passenger to go without seatbelts, but to my knowledge only New Hampshire has no regulations for adults).<br>  <br>  That being said, and having lived in NH for 20 years, a lot of people think seatbelts are either un-necessary or bothersome. And they are, 99% of the time. But that 1% of the time when you get into an accident - they are life-savers!<br>  <br>  Without seatbelts, airbag systems can sometimes be dis-engaged (I believe Hyundai is a company that uses the seat belts to indicate weither or not a person is in a seat and if airbags should deploy in the event of a crash). So anyone who says "Oh the airbag will save me" might not know all the facts.<br>  <br>  Also, airbags can become harmful in the event you are raised from your seat. An airbag can force you up over the steering wheel and through the windshield.<br>  <br>  A person in a car not restrained by a seatbelt can become a deadly projectile inside your vehicle. So although, yes, you are endangering your own life and you should be in charge of your life, you may endanger passengers in the vehicle - and that is not right.<br>  <br>  Im going to stick with wearing them - even if its legally okay for me to not-wear it. Not wearing a seat belt can kill yourself and others - and for the 2-3 seconds it takes to put one on, I think its worth it.|`|QODJNf1oaa	Yes, it's competely selfish to not wear a seat belt.

It's not really a personal choice because it's illegal not to wear one. It doesn't just affect the person not wearing the seat belt, like you said, it affects the kids, families, parents, etc too. So yes you are right.

P5ZkSjyQaa	People 65 and older should have to take a driver qualification test every 6 months.  The reflexes just aren't what they used to be and we don't need hesitant drivers out there.|`|AA11635143	That isn't really the important part?  That would be, "Could you drive a car if it didn't have a horn?"<br>  <br>  Honking is so redneck.  A person has the right to drive at whatever speed they choose as long as it is above the minimum speed.  You should leave earlier and stop trying to push other drivers.   One day you may honk at someone who had road rage and that could get you into a world of hurt.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Hell yes! These people should not be on the road!!!! I am doing them a service. And why are they always in the left lane?????|`|oIkJSPJOaa	No I don't honk at old people, but I do run over squirrels. Do that make me a bad person?|`|YP6zpBxaaa	question is, is it more rude to honk at someone going considerably under the speed limit, or to hold up traffic by going considerably under the speed limit?  There are lots of old people who do not need to be on the road, and drive while being completely unaware of their surroundings.  I have been pulled out in front of, cut off, almost rear-ended, and been stuck in traffic jams caused by old people more than any other demographic.<br>  <br>  If the horn had no purpose other than being rude, then it wouldn't be in all cars produced today.|`|WogL0UpOaa	Nah, i never honk. If somebody is a bad driver, it's not a good idea to distract them. Still, if they're that old, maybe they didn't hear you.|`|os1ydh2daa	no its rude and as long as there not driving crazy theres not reason. Id rather see someone going under the speed limit being cautious that speeding and acting a fool|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Why would you?<br>  <br>  If they're going under the speed limit, they're doing the legally correct thing.<br>  <br>  And by honking at them, you are actually harassing other drivers, which is not legally correct.<br>  <br>  What I do, is when I see young drivers swerve around older drivers, I catch up with those young drivers and try to run them off the road.<br>  <br>  If they have no respect for the elderly, they have no reason to live to be elderly.|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	Honk all you want!

e1ec036988398a4d89da52072850d37daa	no, they don't realize it. these people are in thier own worlds, oblivous to everything going on around them. They mistakenly think that they have a right to drive how ever and where ever they want on public roads.  They are a danger to themselves and everyone around them.  They also cause traffic, and as a result, do direct damage to the environment.  They should be publicly flogged.... or atleast given tickets.|`|oIkJSPJOaa	They are idiot. I think that the police ought to give tickets for that form of reckless driving. Never in an accident but causes a lot of them.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	I fu**ing HATE them!!!!!!!!!!!

Not to mention the ones that go to the very end of the on ramp, then stop completely.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	Yep, lane discipline is atrocious, as you have discovered.  We could certainly learn from the Europeans in this regard.  Driving in Germany is a real treat when you get to see first hand how drivers' can work together and keep the traffic flow at a good pace.

Yq2CUhtYaa	So, you basically just listed all the factory options. That was pretty pointless.<br>  <br>  That said, here's what's important.<br>  <br>  Cars, right now, are depreciating at between 10-15% per year. So, let's figure an average of 13%.<br>  <br>  So, judging from a decent interest rate, etc, I'm going to guess you're putting a down payment of around 5,000-6000.<br>  <br>  Here's the fun part.<br>  <br>  Within two years, you will have spent your downpayment, plus another $6,000. So, a grand total of around $11,000 on the car. And you will still owe another $5000.<br>  <br>  However. At that point, the vehicle is only worth around 10,000. So, if you decide you don't want it anymore, you can sell it for 10, but 5 of that must pay off the remainder of the loan.<br>  <br>  Long story short, your 17k car is going to cost you around 22,000 by the time you're done. And if you sell it within the next two years, you'll only actually get 5k out of it.<br>  <br>  $22000 invested, for a $5000 return.<br>  <br>  Does that sound smart to you? Most intelligent people would say no.|`|AA11852692	I mean sounds good if you want to be in the shop all the time> then go for it.|`|bAY9j21Paa	well my mother in law owned one and she got rid of it.. i guess depends on how the weather is where you live, it is NOT good to drive in rain or snow.. so if you have perfect weather go for it!

D6t6SoFRaa	If your old key is broken, you can't use it.  If the vehicle had to have a chip before, it will still have to have a chip to start.  The ignitions do not come with chip keys.  If they are already coded (this means set up to a certain key, NOT programmed to the ECU) the keys that come with it are templates to cut the new chip keys.  Then they are programmed to the vehicle.  The dealership may code the lock to the original key code to prevent you from having to have two different keys, but they will still have to cut and program a chip key.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Yes....|`|DV4xyeChaa	yes if u have dealer replace lock you will get new coded keys..|`|KjVKNjwNaa	unless they change the whole ignition..you will need the same chip key!

QmBEyD4paa	in the US   500cc bikes and above use the 24’ line while those under 500cc’s use the 20’ line.  Five point deductions are earned for touching the boundary lines and/or putting a foot down. <br>  Step1 Start off by moving forward in first gear at a very slow speed. Idle speed is usually sufficient for this exercise. Keep the clutch covered, but don't pull it in yet. <br>  Step2 Turn the handle bars in the direction of your turn, leaning the bike as it goes. You can now pull in the clutch very slightly (remain in the friction zone). Keep your body as upright as possible and exert downward pressure on the outside foot peg to counter balance the lean. This will allow you to lean the bike further than usual and turn sharper. <br>  Step3 Turn your head in the direction of your turn. Keep your eyes on whatever your exit point is for the turn. Your bike will go where you look, so don't look at the ground. <br>  Step4 Once you've reached the end of the U-turn, let the clutch out fully and accelerate out of it. The bike will straighten itself once you add a little throttle.|`|5tOCiM3Yaa	It will be approximately a 15' diameter circle in which you do the turn. Additionally there is no set speed that I remember of for doing the turn, however you cannot touch your feet to the ground whatsoever. You must keep your feet up (preferably on your pegs) through the entire turn.<br>  <br>  Since A2 I guess is a British and/or European endorsement, I don't know how much it'll differ from the road test I took state side (M1 endorsement). To find out for sure the specifics of what will be required of you during the test, phone your DMV (or whatever they're called over there) and ask them.|`|UTlRfIQFaa	in the motorcycle safety course i was in. the instructor showed the class and expected us to beable to do a U-turn at 5 miles an hour and in the space of 2 side-by-side parking spaces.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	It really depends on if you are riding at speed or if you are walking the bike.

Warranties are after all, meant to be a profit center for the dealership and for the manufacturer... they don't sell warranties as favors, they do it for profit.  That said, it can benefit you if you need to use it, and can lend more to your resale value.  But the last thing to consider, is a sporty is so easy to customize, and that over 5 years, you will likely change a few goodies that may effect the warranty's validity.  $915 can buy allot of repair parts if you can do your own wrenching.<br>  I work in a dealership and I don't buy warranties.|`|aKirAFKdaa	I'm sure bike extended warranties are as much a scam as car extended warranties.

AA10724010	If you can't find a Hayabusa, don't forget its near clone the Kawasaki ZX-14.  I'm only 6 ft and 175 lbs, so I can't imagine riding a bike so big and heavy as those 2, but if you like them, those are really the only 2 bikes in that sport/tour category.  I ride a GSX-R750, which is perfect for me as I ride on street and road track.  If you have an interest in doing trackdays you will want the GSXR and not the Hayabusa, the GSXR handles much better and is much lighter, so its quicker and stops faster.  I don't think I've ever seen a Hayabusa on a road track, it's just too much of a beast, but great for 1/4 mile straight tracks.|`|YP6zpBxaaa	depends on what you want.  The hayabusa is bigger, heavier, more powerful, but honestly, more of a touring bike than the gixxer 1000 is.  If you're going to just be cruising and doing road trips, the 'Busa would be more comfortable.  for all-out performance, a gixxer 1000 or even 750 would beat a hayabusa on anything but a perfectly straight road

So if you do have a factory radio with a CD button and you cant find the CD slot or box and you want one, you will have to take the radio out and plug in a cd kit and there are aftermarket cd player kits that you can plug into it, BUT it wont be a high end type, something more like a audiovox|`|8938823b93c7a8fab3771af7c8ebf1e7aa	Hi<br>  <br>  I had a voyager although it was a newer version.

4biGrjPkaa	Of course you can, having lumbar support has nothing to do with the MOT as suggested above. So long as the seats are securely mounted it will pass an MOT.<br>  <br>  The saloon and estate models share the same front seats, its only the rears that are different, since your partners has lumber support i'm guessing theirs is a better spec. Compare the 4 mounting bolts where the seats are attached to the floor, I'm sure you'll find they're the same.<br>  <br>  Get a mechanic to change them for you, just incase you damage the seatbelt pretensioner.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  EDIT: As per IAN L, I should've said - make sure you get seats from the same year and/or shape of passat as yours.|`|434ae21c53144cc6040a9999bb94dfc6aa	yes in the us and no in uk|`|fBb1tOrvaa	As suggested above - the seats can be changed, but best stick within the year of manufacture or at least a donor car of the same iteration (ie: only put Mk4 seats in a Mk4).

vzIEn14zaa	Proper repair to the cover will run upwards of $1000 for an aftermarket part or $1500 for an OEM part.  <br>  <br>  You cannot fix the current one properly, thats the issue with plastic vs metal.  No bondo type fix will work since plastic flexes and bondo doesnt (as much).  You need some serious gear to remelt and remould the bumper cover.  Not going to happen. <br>  <br>  You can get a repalcement at the wrecker, but chances are you wont find one since the reason a 99 civic is at the wrecker is most likely due to accident and there wont be any for you to pick from, and if you do find one chances of it being the same paint colour is slim...you will need to get a hold of the brackets and clips too.<br>  <br>  Tuck tape or duct tape will work but looks horrible and will need to be replaced frequently.<br>  <br>  If you dont want to sink a lot of money into it go this route:<br>  <br>  Take the bumper cover off, get a hold of some some strong plastic bonding glue (loctite) and get a piece of plastic.  Consider going to the wrecker for this and get some front bumper cover plastic so it matches thickness and flexability.  Bring the cracked plastic on your bumper to as close to where it was before the accident and glue the plastic piece to the back of the bumper where the hole is so it makes the cracked plastic flush to itself.  In other words patch the hole and put the cover back on .  <br>  <br>  Goodluck|`|4Cxys1P7aa	Do you have insurance.

4biGrjPkaa	If you do your insurance through a broker then they'll know. Otherwise you could check your bank or credit card statements if you have them and you paid in either of these methods. I'm sure your bank can issue historical statements (for a nominal fee!).<br>  <br>  There is an insurance database but unfortunatly Joe Public doesnt have access to it!|`|2dC4KCXPaa	No there is no "offical" record. I would try and find old statements from previous insurance companies. But sorry other than that there is NO way to find out. Just shop and find a good rate and stick with them. You by switch are losing out on  a discount most insurance companies offer. Its a renewl discount or renewl credits. Lets say you had Allstate Insurance 6months ago and you tell them when you go to sign up again that you have had Allstate before you get renewl credits from your past. But it depends on how long you with them prior. So make sure to tell the companies you are unsure if you with them or not so they can look you up in their book of business.

A judge is going to be more understanding in your age, yet you are still going to be on probation for 12 months.

AE9dKMEFaa	dont get books, get the DSA cd-roms, everything you'll need to know about the tests are on there, the questions are very repetitive and easier to learn.<br>  Think about it, how can you learn everything in a book???, the cd-rom is the best way to learn.<br>  <br>  check out the DSA website, they have free mock tests and hazard preception video mock tests as well.<br>  <br>  thats what i'm doing...good luck!!!|`|sgMno1PRaa	I didnt buy any books for my theory.

Pick one up from a charity shop or visit the library (a place where books or cd's can be borrowed... I know you younger ones don't venture into these places nowadays).<br>  Even picking up a really old copy of the theory and hazard would be ok.... it's not like they add an extra thousand questions to the bank of questions (which is only just over 1000 as it is.... and that's only due to the various permutations of asking the same questions).<br>  <br>  Books?!?!....... a pain in the butt. It's much faster and less arduous doing the practice on the pc. Besides, the Hazard part can't be practiced in a book.<br>  <br>  If you are been driven anywhere by a friend or member of your family, practice scanning the road and look out for situations that may occur which could actually turn into a potential danger if evasive action wasn't taken by the person who was driving.... like pedestrians walking onto the road or buses pulling up at or moving off from bus stops, lorries having to take a wide course in order to get round tight corners etc..<br>  <br>  There you go... that's all there is to it...... erm, except the actual driving thingy bit.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|tACp8AI5aa	If you're going to learn driving, it's doesn't matter what book will you buy. all you need only..

It's free.<br>  After reading that and understanding everything inside of it, I suggest the next one be on Defensive Driving.  Follow this by some book on how a car runs, what makes it go and stop, etc.  The more you know and understand as much as you can about this 3 to 5,000# vehicle you'll soon be driving, you'll realize it's not all fun and games but rather can be a deadly weapon that deserves your total attention, respect and care so you won't injure or kill yourself or anyone else.<br>  Safety is no accident!|`|gnCiGSjbaa	The only book I can think of is the one that is put out by whatever state you live in (US).

c5bd4117a27e66b1b77c665d58cb4641aa	I have to agree with you on most of the stuff you say. Truck drivers are not respected mostly because the majority of our population is so shallow that they only see the outside image of a person and judge them by it. It is very obvious for anyone who traveled cross country in their car that after doing so you get scared looking at yourself in the mirror that traveling 5 - 10 straight without being home it is very hard to keep yourself in good shape. By saying truck driving is not a real job, it like saying an airline pilot is not a real job, there are a lot of similarities between them. A professional truck driver not only drives the truck, he also keeps it well maintained (for you diesel mechanic), keeping up with tight schedules/deadlines/appointments, filling out proper documentation, and self managing yourself on the go. As regards to pay, it varies quite dramatically from place to place. You can make anywhere from $30,000 - $70,000 as a driver and anywhere from $40,000 - $100,000 as an owner operator so in reality you can make a pretty good living (if you can call this "living") driving a truck as long as you are not standing around.|`|n1ud2imTaa	I feel the same about it being the fact that i am truck driver my self. although some people may not consider this a job it is . Because if we were to stop one way or the other they would end up loosing there jobs.

(esurance has been really cheap for me in the past too). <br>  <br>  You can also try local insurance companies.

fLKvHHtsaa	I have taught people to drive stick-shift.  Unfortunately, some people just don't seem able (I can't play guitar!).|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Learning to drive a stick-shift can be frustrating at first, but if you "stick" with it, it will become like second-nature to you. <br>  <br>  Just don't try to get it all down at once. Learn a little bit at a time. Practice using the clutch by going forward and backward, forward and backward, in a long driveway, using just 1st gear and reverse. Then move to a parking lot and begin using both 1st and 2nd, and reverse. Then get on the street using all gears.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	I taught my wife to drive a stick in about 15 minutes. If she can handle it, anyone can.|`|pNy8lakjaa	It can be hard, but I wouldn't learn how to do it on a brand new mustang, it would be a bad idea to destroy the clutch. Ask friends to see if they will teach you and if they have a car to teach you on.|`|YP6zpBxaaa	no, it isn't hard to learn to drive a stickshift.  it will take you a while to become really smooth with it.  Mustangs are good cars, individual.|`|R2kcXBraaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.noneto.com|`|yFtrO4zFaa	I learned on a stick shift (column 3 speed). It takes a while to get the feel of the clutch ...when it releases and grabs...that should take less than an hour to master. Knowing when to shift will come next.... just practice starting from a dead stop in 1st until you feel comfortable. Shifting from 1st to 2nd to 3rd, etc. is a snap because you are already moving..... no stalling. It's fun and you feel like driving for real.. also more control over gears than auto. I have auto now and miss shifting. Mustangs are great 'little' cars.... I would get a 6 cyl (200HP) with a 5-speed stick... great power and handling... and cheaper on gas than a V-8 GT.

cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	5 qts. of 10w-30 with a new oil filter.|`|MQPJ2UaGaa	5.0 qrts with filter change,on the money.|`|QzAdWvW0aa	Good question. I grew up with these cars and built many of the little 350 ci engines. They are wonderful little power plants. Congrats on saving one of these little treasures.<br>  Back in the day these engines came out with a 5 QT system on the normal. However there were many many oil pans out there that held an extra qt of oil you will also find that there are oil filters that will hold 2 qt`s of oil for that engine. I would change the oil and filter at the same time so that I would know for fact which system I had on my car. Start off with dumping everything drin the oil from the pan and remove the filter. If your drain plug is in the rear of the pan then put your front wheels on a slight incline so that all the oil runs to the rear of the pan and completely drains as well as you can get it to. After it slows to a drip a second then put your plug back in. Put 4 qt`s back into the engine. Then fill your oil filter, if the filter is a screw on put a little oil around the rubber seal and install your new filter. You will have a little oil left out of the qt you filled the filter with so go ahead and dump it into the engine. This will give you 5 qt`s which is enough to fill the smalles system that GM came out with on those little engines. Now after the 5 qt`s are in check under your car and make sure there are no leaks. Start your car and watch under it for a few minutes making sure you still don`t have any leaks especially watching the ground or floor under the location of the drain plug and oil filter. Let the car warm completly up to 180 degrees, and then shut it off. Let it set for 20 minutes and check your oil. The 20 minutes is so most all the oil can run back into to your oil pan. If your oil is down ad what you need slowly so that the next change you will know exactly what you need. <br>  <br>  One other thing. Now is the time to consider changin that engine over to a full synthetic oil. You can go twice the miles between oil changes and your engine will live twice as long before it needs another overhaul.<br>  These engines were only good for around 80 to a 100 thousand miles when they were designed. Afull synthetic will double the life of that engine. <br>  One other thing, something I just learned about recently. Some of the oil companys have removed a chemical from their oil that is required on the older engines to keep the lifters from destroying themselves. I was reading about it the other day on one of the major cam mfg`s while shopping for a roller cam for one of my older cars. I forget what the chemical is called but you should really research and find out what it is and what oils are now with out it. I should have book marked the web site but didn`t. Try calling crane or crower they should know something about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|C2JR6CRxaa	I would use either Havoline or Valvotine 10-30.  With the filter change it should take 5 quarts.  To be on the safe side start the engine and let it run for a few minutes and check the oil level, add more if necessary.|`|yzZchHHTaa	Usually about 5.5 Quarts with filter change and 10W-30 was the recommended in the day.  Start with 4.5 and add until full. then recheck after running a couple minutes shut off and top off.|`|91365d1a40ff3d8ae08da3542098d99baa	5 qts that should be a 327 or a 283 those were the stock small blocks or the big block 409|`|285b98a01876e1a83f6a503f40258aa6aa	5 qts.  total , with an oil filter change. I love Castrol oil. Normally I use 10-40 w. But I live in a fairly warm climate, California. It is really hard to go wrong with oil in a 350, I have a couple of them now. In my Corvette I use Mobil 1 synthetic, because that is what is recommended by GM. It is way price though! 5-6 $ prt QT.

hHmoPqsBaa	i was in a car accident too about a year ago. i was in the passenger seat and we flipped over. i got over my fear by getting back behind the wheel. you know that "face ur fears" saying? well it works. you have to get back behind the wheel and practice. if you're a careful driver then you'll be less likely to have another accident. don't let the fear of driving stop you from doing so. be prepared for whatever comes your way. go to this link so u can see how the car ended up. i was lucky to get out alive.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://s201.photobucket.com/albums/aa173/nmy_garcia/?action=view&current=Apr06_0004.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s201.photobucket.com/albums/aa173...</a>|`|yuBuNoPDaa	After that, it's normal to be afraid. I think it's going to take time and you have to find a way to gain control. Practice defensive driving - Assume nothing about other drivers - don't just assume that you have the right of way - other drivers might think differently - do all you can to avoid accidents by paying attention - thinking - observing - responding. Err on the side of caution. This has worked for me. When in doubt, continue on if you think you are going to miss a turn. Don't take unnecessary risks to save time. Don't assume that other drivers are paying attention or see you. When the light turns, look both ways before moving on. Drivers do run red lights. Sometimes the lights malfunction. <br>  <br>  It's normal to be afraid. By being proactive and driving defensively - these are ways to control your fear so you can drive confidently.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you. Confidence is key. Driving defensively is key.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Practice. practice. practice.    The idea behind driving is "not to sideswipe or collide with anybody else"  Guaranteed not to pass if you do.    So think that everyone is trying to follow the rules of the road (but there will always be someone somewhere on some planet with their heads in the clouds who will forget what they are doing or not watching out for themselves who will make a boo boo.<br>     A part of being a good driver is watching out and thinking for the other guy and what they might do.    That is why driving is a "'stress".|`|wpgRMjgraa	Read this site it is very helpful and best of luck.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/howtogetoverfearofdriving" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/howtogetoverfearo...</a>
