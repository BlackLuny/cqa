20090131171618AAb3XQ8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Children of cheating parents.?	Why isn't when a child comes on here and says that they have found out that their mom or dad has cheated and if they should tell the other parent about it people will say dont tell him/her cause its their problem to deal with and yea that's true it is the parents problem BUT the other parent deserves to know so he/she can get checked for any std's...I'm sure the parent who is cheating isn't going to admit or confess to being unfaithful for the other parent to get checked for any std's if the child is unaware of...So i think if the child knows their mom or dad is cheating they they should tell the other parent so they can get checked for any diseases its the right thing to do in my opinion.

20090131171750AAbTRsK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband doesn't like his job so he wants me to go to work and him stay home instead?	Now I'm not saying I *shouldn't* go to work but I have also been home studying and taking care of our son which includes breastfeeding and giving him my full attention all day. My husband can't find a good job so he's basically had enough of it. Problem, he can make way more money than me. He is a university graduate ( history degree ) and I am a HIGH SCHOOL graduate lol...My last job paid 10 bucks an hour and I don't see how I can support us on that unless I get 2 jobs. I am also hurt because I don't want to have to never see my son just because hubby is pissed he's not making $50k+ a year...ughhh what do I do?

20090131172116AAAO7FV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Who was wronged??!!! HELP, PLEASE!!!?	My friend Janice had a boyfriend named Rick, alright? Well, Janice's best boy BFF Mick was dating Janice's girl BFF Kate, when Janice started liking Mick and kissed him over the weekend... she felt really bad, broke up with Rick, and started dating Mick after he broke up with Kate... Kate got PO'd, but forgave Janice in the end. In fact, Rick and Kate started dating!!   BUT, Janice and Rick started liking each other again, Kate got dumped by Rick, and blamed everything on Janice, who bitched at Kate for bitching at her (haha, I love how that's a verb :P) Anyways, Janice is always talking about Kate, and Kate is absolutely heartbroken.

20090131172732AA0Bxap	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What are tips you can pass onto me for how to make it last?	I'm 20 and my bf is 22 & we've been dating for 2 1/2 years now. It's amazing, it's wonderful and I'm SO happy w/ him. Our relationship just blows me away!         I knew he was the 1 for me shortly after we started dating but, since he's young he didn't feel the same. I've just been patient and loving him, enjoying the wonderful things we have together & just being happy we're together, but lately he's started to talk about how lucky he is to have me... and telling me he never wants to leave me & he'll never leave me. He's never said things like that before because he wasn't sure about us.          We've always been open with each other and talked about having a future together and our feelings and he's always shown me levels and levels of unconditional love, he just wasn't certain. So he never said things like that before, which makes me wonder if he's starting to make up his mind about me... please let me know if from an outside perspective if it seems that way to you as well?         Lately I've just seen this change, like he really might be getting ready to tell me I'm all he wants for the rest of his life, I dunno...        http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g120/h...       But because of that I'd love to know how you make it through the years and years of commitment, what are the essentials to make it last.      We already communicate whenever we have problems, trust each other completely, try to always love w/o condition, we make love a lot, try to take care of the other when the other needs it, we are both 100% supportive of each other's dreams, we both want kids together someday, we both want to contribute fairly evenly financially, both love & want animals and so on, what other things are good to talk about?definitelytely don't want to get married until I've graduated school and both of us are financially ready for commitmentment. We live together right now and have lived together almost a year now. It's great, I've learned I can deal w/ his dirty laundry all over the floor and all those wonderful things you learn abeach otherther when you live together.       So how do you make it last?      And what other things are good to learn about each other?      How do you get through the really hard times?      I love this man, I want to be the best I can be for him and I don't want to have a divorce someday.... please advise me.

Ok, well I'm 14, and a guy has only asked me out like 2 times tops, and that was a year ago, and i said no. so obviously, i'm not an expert with the whole "getting asked out by guys" thing.   Ok, now. This guy who is a year younger texted my friend wanting to know if i would go out with him. I still don't know what to say. I barely know him, but my friend does, and he is nice. but I don't really think i want to go out with him. stuff like that spreads too quickly. and the guy i do like, might find out, and then it'd be bad... so, two questions.   #1. what do i say, yes or no?   #2. If i say no, how do i say no.?      Thank you.

20090131174105AAbrnFg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does it sound ridiculous to you if someone keeps his or her virginity until matrimony?	I am an immigrant who came from China few years ago. I am the conservative type, so there are many things for me to get used to when I came here. I do have Chinese values and rules that guides me through everyday, but I keep most of it to myself and keep an open mind outside my home. Here is the thing, I am a Twilight fan, I remember in a part of the third book Eclipse, Bella laughed at Edward's notion of protecting his virtue. So, does the idea of keep virginity until matrimony really sounds that ridiculous? Is that not acceptable to Americans?

The last time the judge spoke with him she ordered him to come up with $3000.00 in two weeks or spend 6 months in jail. Does anyone have experience with this? Do they really keep someone in jail that long for not paying child support?

We never dated, we never did anything. We liked each other and just kind of acted like we were dating (confusing right... yeah tell me about it). So Lately he's kind of been acting weird around me. We used to be really close, like best buds. Now whenever he passes me in the hallway or is standing around after school talking to me he looks at me like I'm a piece of meat. I don't understand why. Whats going through his head. These looks kind of scare me because that's not Chris, that's not who he is. And today before third hour he gave me "the nod". He doesn't do "the nod". He's acting like a totally different person, except he is still himself. What's going on with him?

I never realized YA was this imp until now! seriously! im really mad right now. phew, ok here's what happened. when I was 15, in high school, i went out w/ 3 guys in one day. it was just OMCE. and it's not like i was whoring out or something. 3 guys asked me out and i couldnt decide whom to possibly choose & my best friend suggested I go out w/ all of 3 them which i did. long story short 2 of the guys came to know i cheated and they let the whole school know. the 3rd guy was too much *in love* w/ me to believe the other 2. i wasnt a slut and basically i never dated in high school. my mom told me no one ends up w/ a guy they batted eyelashes at in high school..i just had guy friends and pretty much concentrated on my grades..i dated only 3 guys in college, and ended up getting married to one of them. we have been together for 4 yrs now and have a 10 m/o.    last night i went to friend's reunion, and guess who i bump into? jake-one of the guy i cheated on like 12 yrs ago..he wasnt being very nice to me but i decided to let it slide..but apparently he didnt. my husband walked up to me this morning and he goes like a guy called me last night and said your wife is screwing around w/ 3 guys, wtf is with that? he actually called my husband and told him what i did as a stupid 15 yr old? i mean who the **** is he to judge me like that when he made a baby out of wedlock and is now in a messy divorce b/c he was cheating on his wife?   im sorry for all the typos but im really mad right now!

But I don't want to seem clingy and trying to get his attention and stuff. But I don't want to seem like I don't want him around and avoid him either. And I just really want to ge close to him. What should I do?!?!?! I really like him...like I'm on the verge of heartbreak. And yes I know, I'm only in high school. But you can have strong feelings like this in high school. Trust me. Haha! So...what should I do?

20090131190650AAtZHAd	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does my ex boyfriend want me back? Or am I being messed with?	My boyfriend of 2 months broke up with me, and now one of his friends keeps talking to me and my friends online. First he asked me if I still liked my ex, and i said no. He said that my ex wanted to get back together with me, so i tried talking to my ex and he denied it. So now his friend keeps talking to me and says stuff for example: that i was embarassed to be with him, and that he thinks my ex still likes me. But my ex hasn't said anything?    I just want to know what is going on? Should i try to talk to my ex? Or should i just stop talking to his friend? Is his friend just trying to cause trouble? Is he just messing with me?    PS:  We broke up because he said there was not enough communication, or so he said. And I am not sure if i want him back or not. I fell like it would be a very big mistake to take him back because I was very hurt, so hurt i failed all of my final exams because i could not study, let alone eat. (i should mention we broke up a week before exams). And when i tired to talk to him, i texted him and he told me he was in a class, but i was able to look up the class schedual and there is no class offered at that time that he said he was in, aka he lied to me. and i know that he lied about a test grade because i saw his grades....so its not the first time. So i think if i took him back i would just be doing to stop the current loneliness that i am in. i can honestly say i don't know anymore, I'm so confused!

Ok, im 13 and i wanna get out of the house and do more stuff with my friends and there's this girl that I wanna ask out also. Problem is, my parents still think im 5 or something. I cant IM my friends, use myspace or facebook, or even text on my ancient cell phone. Its not like i dont work hard or act bad or anything. I get all a's and im on the travel soccer team.   More on the girl stuff: Whenever one of my friends who's a girl rings my bell my mom like snaps or something and starts questioning me and all. ( btw, they wont really encourage my bro to go out or anything and he's 16) My dad doesn't usually care about the girl stuff, but on some days he acts mad at everything, and even being in his sight makes him go crazy.   Also, when my dad or anyone else like my friends mentions anything close to having to do with girls, she gets all mad and the atmosphere in the room is really awkward.   oh yeah...I dont have any intentions of drinking or drugs or anything like that and my parents should now this--Also my friends arent like that either.   For example: Ive had these 2 twins as a friends 4 a long long time.  Their parents are really cool, and they were having this party at their house.  Boys and Girls were invited---Only the best friends of the twins were invited 2 the after party sleepover. (of course there were no girls invited 2 the sleepover). Also, the party was going 2 be supervised, and there would be no drugs or alcohol, and none of the friend circle would do things like that anyways...I asked them 2 go and told them all the details, but they got all mad because girls were going 2 be there.    Basically i wanna have a life and 2 not be stalked by my parents 24/7.   Tips and advice would help...

How would you react? Try to be specific please         In this situation, she couldn't really explain why she was upset. She just felt like, all her emotions just randomly overboiled. Like she'd been holding in too long. Though she wouldn't explain it to you really.
20090131153655AAprkcN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do single parents date?	I am not planing on starting dating yet, but i am concerned about the time.  I have a 50-50 custody and my days are tues Fri night sat and sun.. The ex Works on the weekends and he will get him on sun night.  Now dont get me wrong i love me son more then anything, and i really want full custody. But as far as dating i have already i told myself i would not bring women around him until i am sure they will be around for a long time.   Do you just hire a baby sitter for a weekend day, just thinking about it makes me feel very guilty since i dont even see him every night.

20090131154626AAzi9ok	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think this is a good idea?	my ex fiance and I have been talking about getting back together, but aren't there yet.  Someone suggested to me that I write down a letter and tell him exactly how I feel and all the little things I miss about him being here, it's hard for me to put into words when I talk to him, and he has a hard time expressing his emotions too.  Guys would you find it sweet if someone did that for you?  We both still love each other, but there is hurt that is being worked thru, I'm just trying to speed things along
20090131201122AAySQ6l	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can i get my freedom back?	I am German (from Bayern) and married to an Afghan man. One day my husband went out shopping and I told him I would get a visit from some friends. My two best friends (Hans and Fritz) are males. They are also brothers and they don't live far away from my house. We were playing cards and drinking beer. We were just having some innocent fun with playing cards. My husband came home and saw me, Hans and Fritz in the sofa and he got really angry! He screamed at Hans and Fritz and told them "this is my wife! don't come near her!". He then chased them out and called them "dirty Germans". Then he shouted at me and told me that he forbade me to see Hans and Fritz again. He also forbids me to see my gay friend Wolfgang. He told me that Wolfgang is only acting gay to get my attention. I'm getting so pissed off. Can't my husband realize that we are in Bayern (Germany) and not in Afghanistan? Can't he realize that men and women talk together and drink together without being sexually involved? Why does he mind me being friends with a gay man? And why doesn't he want to wear a lederhosen?  http://besttravelblogevar.files.wordpres...  I want to buy a lederhosen for him but he doesn't want one. He says they look stupid. Everybody here in my town wear dirndl and lederhosen. He forbids me to wear short dirndls because he thinks they will attract other men. Now I can only wear long dirndls. Why is he taking away my freedom? How can I meet Hans and Fritz?

20090131170629AAvqL05	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would it be ok to send flowers?	Its a long story, but my husband lives with my MIL because we are separated and he and I are not on speaking terms. I was jealous big time b/c he lives there and acted really nasty to her!      Today I allowed her to come over and we reconciled (hopefully). I am thinking of sending her some flowers to her house, but am scared that he will throw them away or do something bad and my money will be wasted and she will not get the flowers....      Is it a good idea to send her flowers, or should I send them @ her work (would that look bad for her?, she has a professional job.)      Or should I do something else?      Will the delivery man make her sign for them, and not allow my husband to?      What shall I do?

Should I Tell Her I Like Her Or Ask Her Out      She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT)..    In Class last year if the teacher calls my name she would turn around look at me and smile and even now she still doesSometimes she would tell me she loves me but i wasnt sure if shes serious because her friends say it to. We talk mostly on msn and barely at school, but her and her friends always get excited when i show up. We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np. And when I got on the bus her & her best friend saved me a seat.

20090131165815AA88YvR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is the story here?	I noticed something else about a male friends behaviour. If I dress up for work, he acts like he doesn't even see me. I mean he completely ignores me and then if I say hello, he acts like..'oh hi, I didn't see you there' or like I'm just something he hardly noticed at all. Like I am nothing. BUT if I am dressed casually, he smiles and me and makes an effort to say hello. Why is that? Is he afraid that I am dressing up to impress him? But if that's the case, then why bother being friendly the next day? And if he just wants friendship, then why not just be consistent and say hello the whole time, or not at all? In the past he said he wanted me etc, but I turned him down often cause he surrounds himself with women and I didn't want to be just another one. I mean he is totally confident with far better looking women than me and is known as a flirt.   The other day he acted like he didnt see me in the office, but I caught him looking me up and down when he thought I wasn't looking. Then he started singing really loudly and whistling to himself as he left and You could hear him singing really loudly outside the door.

My girlfriend and i had a small argument about something we didn't agree on she listened to music with lots of swearing and cussin and i think it doesn't fit her she's better than that, but now she tells me she doesn't trust me anymore and doesn't know why loves me after the pain she went through. I told her that it wasn't my intention to hurt her but i want to put this in the past but she still hangs on to it and keeps bringing it up like i'm a bad person.      I told her i love her but she doesn't respond that she loves me also i opened up my feelings towards her and she doesn't respond either.   I'm hurt and tears run down from my eyes when i think on how i'm going to lose her because she's not willing to move forward about something so stupid. My next step is to just tell her i don't feel that i want to be with her anymore despite everything we've been through when she was sick i was the only one around making sure she's okay and i loved her more since then.      Why would a girl you love so much and you tell her you love her everyday just despise you all of a sudden, i'm turning away and i'm not coming back to her i feel so hurt and angry that i don't want to love anymore.

20090131154725AAQNpkV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What if he wants to go bowling, but I don't?	My husband of 28 years wants us to go bowling once or more a week.  He insists that  I go too, because he says it's a way for us to "spend time together." The truth is, he loves bowling.  I think it's fun  occasionally, but I don't want to do it on a regular basis. My health isn't good, and I have arthritis.  It's hard on me sometimes, and I come home exhausted, completely wiped out--especially after a 2 hour cosmic bowl.  And if I get too tired while we're there (usually after the first hour) and sit out while he bowls, it's boring.        The problem is that if I don't want to go, he's resentful.  If I go, and I don't want to, I'm resentful.  We got into a huge fight over it before Christmas.        I've even suggested that he join a league and go without me.  But he refuses, insisting that he doesn't want to go without me.  We are a very close couple and do everything together,  but this is causing some hard feelings in our relationship.      Any suggestions about how to deal with this?

20090131201422AAHPubV	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Problem with wedding rental company..what would you do?	So I went last week to a wedding rental place to pick out linens, china and so on for the reception.  I really liked these organza overlays they had with a vine design on them.  They were not what I planned so I asked the girl how much they were and could I get them in chocolate...wich is one of the wedding colors.  She told me yes she could get them in chocolate and that they are $15. each to rent.  I said okay, well I would rater have those than the plain overlays, they are much prettier.  Fine and dandy.  I went in today to pay the balance (a few months in advance by the way) of the rentals and it was  a lot more than I was quoted...and I had a quote in writing.  I let her know that was a lot more and then after looking over the "new" bill I see they are charging me $50 each for the overlays.  I said, wait these are only $15 that is what is on my quote.  The girl tells me, well that was a mistake, we have to order the chocolate cover and they are $50 each because we have to buy them.  I said...so do I get to keep them since I am buying them.  No, that is the rental on that color because we have to order it from the factory.  I said...well dont you have to order them all from the factory at one point.  She just looked at me and said they are $50.  I cancelled them because that makes them over $500 more than I was quoted.  I told her I would try to find them online or something and she very snotty said "yeah good luck with that".    I feel that this was their mistake and they are just being rude.  I want to just cancel my check that I wrote today and go somewhere else.  I think $50 for a 54" x 54" overlay is nuts.  She did not care AND IT WAS HER that quoted me and her co worker was just as bad.

20090131200233AAa6yhM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I be more interesting for girls?	I had a girlfriend who just recently broke up with me because she has a new guy that is more interesting. It was a 5 year long relationship that I was the good guy and put my all into. So right now I feel like I'm always the good guy that loses because I'm too predictable and straightforward. I don't want to be the bad guy but I want to be more interesting for girls, yet be able to go to college and have a steady job. I've always been the guy that girls always want to hang onto as someone to comfort them when they are hurt, and they say they love me, but as soon as they find the next interesting guy it's a whole different story and I'm done with it. I have always been the one to do everything I can to make everyone happy and what do I get out of it. Nothing for myself but alot of loneliness. Please help!

20090131200141AAgpHDB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My boyfriend/roommate has been taking me for granted lately, my friend suggested I ignore him...?	Is this a good idea? She said I should stop pampering him for a while, not pay him much attention and he will stop taking me for granted. When I say he takes me for granted, I mean he doesn't appreciate the things I do  for him anymore. For instance, we are both really busy, but I still take time to cook for him all the time, and now he acts like I HAVE to do it, he doesn't say thank you anymore and sometimes he complains about the food. I also do his laundry and he doesn't say thank you, he just loads it all in my hamper. He used to be so appreciative, but lately he acts as if he is entitled. He doesn't help out around the apartment anymore and I feel like I am constantly cleaning up. Whenever i ask him to do something, his attitude shows that he has a big  problem with it. Like I asked him to chop the onions for dinner the other night.. Before he'd do it with no problem since I was gonna cook everything else, but now he has to squinch up his face and sigh and breathe heavily just cause I asked that... So should I just stop cooking ad cleaning altogether and ignore him like my friend says? Cause in my opinion it's childish to do that...What do you think?

We have seen one another, because of the whole cam thing. He's not some weirdo he's a high ranking military offical. He tells me he has fallen for me. Both of us being involved in relationships, this is suppose to be nothing more than fantasy. I told him he will never meet me, and he seems to get that. I have tried numerous times to quit talking to him altogether, but within a few days, i'm so down, i give in and start it up again. He says its harmless fun, but he does care deeply for me. To me this has gotten alittle out of hand, and I need to find a way to stoip obsessing about him. Anyone been in this boat before and what did you do.

20090131153813AAHFucU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please answer: Does he just want to be friends?	Sorry for asking in this section but this is the place I can get mature answers         I like a guy in my college a lot. He never used to talk to anyone in class, but ever time he entered the class all the girls would look at him because he is good looking. One day he sat next to me and he started talking, and i liked talking to him. In the middle of conv she asked me if I am a shy person and I said yes. The second time we meet again we had a nice time talking but he told me about his gf.      I like his personality a lot and we have lot in common, but I do not want to tell him that I like him bc he has a gf.      I never liked anyone like this, never wanted to have a bf till I met him. I don't know wht to do now. :(. I like him but can't tell him because he has a gf. Whenever he sees me, he totally ignores whatever he was doing or talkig to and talks 2 me. What sld I do?

20090131160631AAN7mTA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Definiately played....?	back in november my exboyfriend had a little too much to drink. we ended up getting into a physical fight w him spitting in my face and breaking my things, pushing me down to the ground etc.    a co days later i ended up pressing charges for assault. this is his 2nd assault charge. the one before was one with a different girl. Court was 2 days ago. these past two months he has talked to me and we were hanging out and practically dating, which is so stupid of me to do. during the two months leading to the court date, he was telling me how much he has changed and really looked like it to me that he was. it was all an act. if he was convicted he would have gone to county jail and so on. i told him he needed to make more positive choices for his life, like finishing high school. we are 21. its about time to do it. so i helped him go to school and figure his life out. now hes temporarily ruining mine, not letting me see my friends and yell at me about how often i was on my fone. it was a very unhealthy thing for me to do. we ended up going to court, and i dropped the charges because it looked like he was doing good in his life. and if he is going to jail, he doesnt need me to do it. he'll get in trouble again. last night, he ended up having too much to drink and wanted to stop talking to me and broke my keys and pushed me. it was november all over again. i found myself in a situation that was my mistake this time and i am totally screwed. now that he has what he wants, hes not in jail and not talking to me. ive lost my connection with a couple of friends throughout  this just because we are not as close. i am not sure what to do. how do i help myself from not being in this situation again? after 6 years of dating this guy off and on, how do i move on permanately? if i dont this will keep happening. and i dont want to be in this situation ever again. how do i move on to be like the way i was and not communicate with this guy again? ive seem to have lost my way and all that plays in my head is last night. i cant believe that someone would do that. how do i avoid the situation again and grow from this one? the friends have kind of moved on and given up on the situation and im afraid that we wont be as close. im tryin to rekindle the relationship but its too early to tell the outcome. im trying to clean my mess up. what do i do?

20090131162748AAhJKhv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I Feel So Bad.  What Should I do?	I have been married for 11+ years to a sweet man, but his parents are nightmares.  How on earth do I handle people that are typically nice to my face but attack me behind my back and try to undermine my marriage because of jealousy?  I really believe that it is jealousy.   My sister-in-law told my husband that their parents were angry that we moved to my home town.  She said that they blame me for that.  I'm so confused because my husband and I just had lunch with my mother-in-law and she was again sugary sweet to me.  But what I have noticed is that she will find something about me that she knows my husband doesn't approve of and then talk bad to him about "stupid" people that do the same thing.  For example I have tons of shoes and purses and I like to match them.  His mom said that people that do that are stupid and are just trying to impress people, but yet she won't say my name just people that do that.  I think she is trying to cause trouble because she's lonley and jealous.  She tries to turn other family member againest each other.  She say horrible things about her daughter to me and my husband.  My mother-in-law has gone as far to tell her grandson that the other kids in the neighborhood don't want to play with him.  I heard her say this.  I thought how horrible, but I think it's because she doens't want him to have friends.        She's also this way with anyone that her daughter dates or tries to be friends with.  My sister-in-law told my husband that their mom gets so mad sometimes for no reason that she throws and breaks dishes.     I don't even have the space the mention all the bizarre things she has done.  What makes me feel so guilty is that she is so nice to my face. But the way I figure it is that she's nice to me for two reasons.  1. I have what she desperatley wants - her son.  2.  she wants a caregiver for when she gets old.      I've been so nice to his parents and treated them  with such respect, why would they treat me this way?  His dad is almost just as bad but in a different way.  He's very jealous and demands my husbands attention and if he doesn't get it he pouts or wants to leave early.  They are both very jealous of anything we do with my family so my husband doesn't even mention my family to them anymore.   What would you do if you were in my situation.        I rarely go around them anymore.  They live about an hour away.  It hurts my husband that I don't want to be around them but I have to be honest I think they are looking for things to attack me about.  As my sister-in-law put it she has always felt uncomfortable around her own parents because she said she feels like she's being judged.

I'm a boy, 20 years old   I'll tell yom what happened to me briefly.   from about 4 or 5 months i became very close to one of my friends , we were very close to each other and she told me everything about her life.   she told that she was in love with a person and there were many proplems in their relation. she told me all these proplems and then she told me that she didn't want to be with him any more and she can't continue with him and finally she told me that she left him.   after that w became closer and closer to each other and she was trying to be with me in every place and everytime and she left all the world and wanted to be with me and finally told me i love you and i want to be with you all my life and i'll never leave you   we fell in love and we lived a very happy month together.   in this month i felt that she was ready to leave all the world and be with me alone.   but at the end of this month-it was exaclty one month-she told me that she wanted to see me to told me a very important thing.   i went to her and asked her what's up what's wrong with you??   she told me that she couldn't continue with me althaugh that she still loves me.   i tried a lot to say to her that i'll help her and still with her forever and i'll give her my life and i'll do all i can to make her happy.   but finally she told me that she can't forget her 1st love and that she wants to continue with him.   i left her and she tried a lot to call me but i didn't answer her   but she tried again and again till i answered and told me that she misses me a lot and she want to be my friend and she can't lose me.   but i told her that this is very difficult and i can't do that.   i was destroyed and everytime my only wish was that she returns to me   my life was always sad and i couldn't stand all that.   then w began to talk to each other as friends fe a short period and many problems happened to her with her 1st love.   i didn't know anything about that but she got closer to me again and slowly without thinking or awareness w seemed that w returned to each other but without ourselves and we both became little happier than before untill this person returned again to her life and the same thing happened again and i returned to my sad life without her.   but for a short time i didn't see them together anytime and i wasn't shocked by seeing them together and i was away from that for a while.   but the first time i saw them together i was completely destroyed and couldn't that and i wasn't able to talk to anyone even my very close friends.   and now the problem is that i still love her and that they will be always front my eyes with each other living happily.   because they are in my college.   i'll always see this view everyday and every time.   what can i do??   my life is sad and dark   i know that it is impossible to be with each other again and i'm not waiting this and will not let that happen again.   but my life without her is so sad   my days are to long and i don't hace anything to get busy with it.   i can't forget and i can't stand seeing them happy while i'm crying.   can anyone help me.   can anyone tell me what to do if i can't be away from them.   sorry for talking so much but really i wanted to know an answer.   thanks for everyone who will answer me.   plz pray for me

We are definitely in love, however, there has been something that has really been bothering me and I can't get my mind off it....       My fiance and I were talking about how many people she had been with..and ever since it has been making me go crazy.  She said she has been with 9 people including me and said most of it was when she was younger, when she first started she was 16. She is 21 now and I am 23.       I don't know why...but it bothers me that she has been with so many people.  I trust her but for some reason it bothers me.  Is this normal?  Am I jealous, paranoid or what?  It just gets me really pissed off and kind of protective and jealoused easy... ???        I've been with a lot of other people as well,however, it doesn't seem to bother her.  Any thoughts?

20090131192117AAyRC9n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help, I'm in a bad situation, would you be upset?	Yikes. I have a problem. There is this mama dog that comes to my house regularly. I kind of take care of her because her owners (my neighbors) don't really care too much for her. She's losing her hair and isn't in the best health and I always play with her, since they're never really home. Anyways, she has 7 pups and I walked outside today and she brought them to my house on my porch. Now, I was going to go over to my neighbor's house to tell them the pups were over here, but they were never home and now my 10 month old is asleep and I can't leave her to go and tell them. Problem is it's going to be cold tonight and unlike my neighbors I can't stand to think of them outside in the cold. What should I do?...Would you be mad if someone kept your dog overnight in their house? I don't want them to be mad at me, but really they already don't take very good care of the mama or her pups and if I went over there early in the morning, I guess that would be okay right?
20090226074309AAmvrNU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you were dating a married man...?	Okay, hypothetically:   You become pregnant while dating an (unhappily) married man. You have the kid. He's still married but you know you want to be together and continue to see each other. Would you take any pictures of the baby with the man?       I am asking because there are no pics of me and my dad before I was two. He was married at that time. But I kind of think he isn't even my dad and that is why there are no pics.... What do you think? Does my mom have a legit excuse as to why there are no pics?

My fiance was the type that I thought would avoid marriage until he was 40, and he ended up proposing to me in front of his grabage can and his truck right outside his front door on the way to dinner, where he was originally going to propose, but 20 years earlier than I ever expected him to.

20090131185618AAKVCL6	Family & Relationships;Family	I am a fourteen year old girl, and suicidal. What do I do? I don't want to die please help me.?	No one shows any concern if I live or die.    I don't have a father, any siblings, or cousins, or a pet, or any real friends.   I gave everything to this stupid boy when I was only twelve years old because he was the first and last person who ever cared about me, or at least took the time to pretend to. And he just used me and broke my heart.   I've been depressed ever since I can remember, it's not just hormones and it's not just because I'm a teenager because no one else I know is like this. When I try to tell them how I feel, they just think I'm crazy because life is soo great and everyone's going to get married and have three kids and be a doctor or something.       Please help me. I am tired of the aches, and the heavy heart. I've cried everyday for three years, I don't know what or why it hurts so much. I'm always writing suicide notes and throwing them away and re-writing them and throwing them away again. I don't even go out anymore. Everyone's having so much fun and living and loving living and I just can't. I don't see any hope for the future. I'd do anything not to be this way. My first suicide attempt was when I was 12. I've had a total of three and my mom just ignores all of them. She won't take me to therapy because she's just so perfect and she has the perfect new fiance and the perfect friends and I just don't fit in all the perfect-ness. I know she sees it but she just doesn't care.       Please...a lot of you don't know what it's like to never be loved by anyone so a lot of you won't understand what it feels like. So please do not say after years of the disorder that has controlled my youth, the cure is to like "omg join a sport or volunteer at a homeless shelter or talk to Jesus". I just want this all to go away and I know there's more to it than that. I don't want to die, please help me. But my mind is killing me and there's nothing I can do about it. I've already missed out on so much, I quit cheerleading, I skipped my middle school graduation, homecoming, all the football games, all the fun friday nights, winter formal, but I can't get better and I can't get myself out of bed because it hurts too much. I don't know what it is. All I can do is read and sleep and cry for hours and hours on end.

Btw, If you say the word P*** I can't get to my question because of the content barrier thing because I am on my school laptop lol      So I used to watch p... only a few times but my brother found out, younger brother, and he said he didn't care because he did too, which was odd, but now he's giving hints to my parents that I watch it.       Honestly I wouldn't care because my parents were ok with my brother watching p*** but I know they have this thing against girls watching p***.   Unfortunately every once in a while I have the urge to.    Basically is there a way I can watch p... online without my parents/siblings finding out?    I've deleted the history on the search bar thing and I thought that would delete it completely but somehow my brother still found out.    Any tips would be nice.
20090131183446AAAerHF	Family & Relationships;Family	My brother is so UGH !!!?	just because he lost a couple pounds he thinks hes so amazing now. everyday he bothers me about working out, even though i clearly told him i am content with my body. he eats so much food you could empty his belly from one day and end world hunger for a significant amount of time. then when i tell him to stop because its unhealthy, he just says i W0RK 0UT i CAN D0 WHATEVER i WANT. its so annoying but i dont know how to control my anger. soon, im going to EXPL0DE. he also rubs his grades in my face, and says i have no friends [even though i have twice the amount he has because his personality blows]. in like 7th grade i told him i had a low self esteem, and [i dont anymore] but he keeps saying WHY D0NT Y0U JUST G0 CUT YURSELF. he'll say things that obviously anger me, then two seconds later asks for favors and expects me to be happy with him. when i say no he yells GET 0FF Y0UR YEAR L0NG PERi0D AND ST0P PMSiNG ! this isnt healthy for me but i dont know how to calm down. i try to turn to my friend but she wont get over the fact that shes an only child, so it doesnt go anywhere. my other friend just brings up that her brother is the same way, and theyre the only two i can turn to. sometimes i just want to put a gun to his head or stick a knife through his chest but jailtime and murder just doesnt fit my life plan. what can i do to get him off my case ? when i ignore it he bothers me until i cant hold it in anymore, so i cant do that. when i tell my mom, she just says im "Tattle tailing" and to go away. i have no one to turn to ! help please ):

My boyfriend and I had a bit of a fight earlier... we ended up getting off the phone because I thought it'd be best if we just took a breather. When I called back he said his mom called him screaming at him for going over his minutes... he said he'd call me back and now his phone won't accept calls. I know it's his mothers fault but I'm so worried now... When can I talk to him again? How do I know if he's okay? He has no computer or anything right now because she took everything from him... I'm so concerned...

20090226074002AAoSuMo	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why did my ex bf do this?	2 nights ago he called and was being really sweet and we talked for about 2 hrs. Then he finally ask me if I would ever hook back up with him, meaning would i be in a relationship. I told him prob. not bc we are in 2 different places in life. I want to keep my virginity and he is out f*cking every girl possible. This was one of the reason why we broke up. Not bc he cheated on me but he hounded me for sex the entire time we were together and I simply wasn't ready.      So last night he called me and asked me was close to my comp. I was like yeah. He said, could you log into this dating website and type in this girl's name. I want to see what she looks like. I was soo outraged bc he simply could have made up a fake account and found the person. While I am a part of that particular website, don't you find it strange and just crazy that he'd call ME and ask me to log in so I can look at some girl for him.      Why did he do this? I keep seeing this pattern over and over.      He asks me to date him about every month and when i say no.. he does something crazy. Like last month he called me and started crying about his ex gf. Now him and I have only been seperated since OCt. and I make it a point to not call him with crazy stuff. Heck, I don't even now if he was seriously crying bc afterwards he asked me again would I go back out with him and when him and the girl were together, he asked me to date him.      How crazy is that? and the thing is that he was the one who dumped me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      btw we're young adults. 20 and 21

20090226074132AAu20fL	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Father threatened to walk out of the wedding if bride didn't invite all of the relatives. Please help.?	The bride just emailed us(me, the MOH, and 2 other closest friends) and said that her father threatened to walk out of her wedding if she would not invite their whole family - that means all of their relatives from 3 different countries.      Their rationale is that her wedding would be the first "nice" wedding in her whole family, and her parents wanted to impress everybody in their "clan".      Her wedding will have a church ceremony and reception - not her family's usual eloping and shotgun type of wedding.      Her parents also wanted her cousins to be part of her bridal  entourage, but the bride chose me as her MOH, and she specifically said she will choose her closest friends to be part of her entourage. The fact that I'm an MOH is still a secret because her mom will certainly blow up.      The bride and I have been friends over a decade and she's like a sister to me, and I know her mom as well - I just didn't expect that they would react that way over the brides decision.      She's already stressing out over this wedding and she has been emailing almost everyday venting out. Now with this news I'm at a lost as to what to tell her.       She and the groom will pay for the whole event, and they have a tight budget. But her parents told her to invite her relatives from 3 different countries, because if she did, they will send over money if they wouldn't be able to come. But if she didn't her dad will walk out of the wedding.      Any advice?

20090226070627AA1uOz0	Family & Relationships;Family	Why do people look down upon teenaged fathers?	People assume that I don't care about my son, and that I'm just another teen-aged father who runs away from his responsibilities, and it just pisses me off. Just because I'm nineteen, and I have a son DOES NOT mean that I'm running off and leaving my son with my wife. People assume my wife and I are on welfare, and when I go out with my son, people look at me, and I hear people scoff, "Looks like another teenage couple we have to pay for." Damn it, I work three jobs to get enough money to keep my son, while my wife stays at home and takes online classes so we can have a better future for our child. I've been working so hard to keep my baby boy, even before he was born, and I don't understand why I have to put up with these judgmental people. Why do people look down on teen-aged fathers, because I'm so sick of being judged all the time? Why do people look down on me, even when they don't know what the heck I've gone through to keep my son? I'm sorry for ranting, but I'm just pissed off right now.

20090131181627AASsdGD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need advice about this guy...?	Sorry, I know the question is long. The reason it's so long is because all this happened in 2 years. I wanted to include as much of the details as possible. Please only serious answers!       I like a guy, but I don't know if he either likes me or hates me...      We both go to the same high school, I'm 16 and he's 17.      We’re never spoken to each other ever, but we had a few classes together. I'm shy, but I don't know if he is. He's a jock and he always hangs out with other jocks.      He always stares at me everyday! He’ll stare if I’m anywhere in his sight. I never seen him staring at any other girls (whenever I’m around anyways). Sometimes I won’t even look at him, and my friends will tell me he’s staring. When I catch him staring, he just stares back and doesn’t look away. I can't remember, but sometimes it would be just a blank expression, or sometimes a smile. He even stares at me when I walk by him in the halls. He’s trying to get my attention. Would he stare at me if he hated me? I doesn’t really make sense that a guy would stare at a girl he hates. Why do you think he stares so much?       He somehow found out I liked him. I think he told everyone I liked him. I know he’s been talking to his friends about me because his best friend knew who I was, and I didn’t know who he was. I don’t talk to any of his friends, but I feel like sometimes they’re making fun of me and/or spreading rumors. I don't know if this is true though. When he’s with his friends and I come into the room, they all turn and look at me. His friends don’t stare at me, just him. When I see his friends in the halls, they don’t acknowledge me. His friends aren't mean to me (at least not to my face).       He even asked my sister about me. They have a class together and sit beside each other, but they never talk to each other. He asked her if I talk to her about guys, if I had a boyfriend, if I liked this guy ___ in our class, etc. He seen me sitting with him in our class. He was staring at me and he looked jealous. Then he tried talking to me on MSN and I didn’t reply.       I got a job where he worked, and I regret it. At first I didn’t like it because he would flirt with this girl right in front of me and he made up a story that they hooked up (he never told me this, he said it in front of me). When he worked alone with me, he was all quiet and he wouldn’t try talking to me. We stood far apart from each other. He only asked me if I needed help.  The girl he flirted with hates me because I called her a '*****'. She talks to him a lot and she probably is talking **** about me to him. The strangest thing he does is stare at me when I'm talking to other guys.      I stopped looking at him because it wasn't getting anywhere. I was walking with my sister by him and his friends. I walked past them without looking. My sister told me one of them was like “Look who it is”, and he pointed at me. Both he and his friend were looking at me and smiling.       I haven't seen him in a year. I am going to try talk to him, but first I want to make a decision whether he likes me or hates me to aviod humiliation. I can't get over him...      Thank you if you've read all this.       ? Ashley

Jack doesn't touch Maid Marion, she's just there to feel up on Jack and Make out with Jill.

Her Name was Brittney, and we had been friends since she was 4 and i was 5. We hung out all the time, or thats how it felt. I told her everything and sooner or later I was like her big sister. We normally went to her house because I loved her mom. Life was just wonderful. yeahh there were a few rough spots but hey whats a friendship with out a few cat fights here and there. I was there for her when she fell and got seriously hurt one cheerleading practice. I was there when her mom made stupid young mother decisions (her mom was a teenage parent)and she was there for me when my parents weren't getting along to well. well this wonderful friendship haulted to a stop one cheerleading practice. She came in to tell me that she was moving to a town about and hour away to live with her mother's RICH but very ugly boyfriend (her mother was gorgeous.)She acted like it was no big deal. promised me over and over again we would remain friends. But things weren't right. Her mother began to hate me. I don't know why but she did. She hardly let me see her before she moved. And her mom wasn't fun anymore. She was very uptight and had change drastically. The day she moved I was devestated. And things haven't change since. I've only seen her 3 times. a month after she left, about 2 months after that and finally about 5 months after that. So it has been a year since I've seen her and about 4 months since i've spoken to her. My birthday is today and i just wish she could have called. well I don't know what to do. I would love some advice.

20090226063851AAAuY4E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about my ex?	me and my ex girlfriend broke up a four months ago but finally decided to stop talking about a month ago (i know, really really late). Ive always wanted to get back with her because i love her very much, shes a great girl and a ton of fun to be around. we haven't really talked in about three weeks and then she called me up a couple of nights ago, talking about how i was a great boyfriend and she misses me. However, she was saying that she doesn't want to like me and she doesn't want to hang out because shes afraid shell start liking me again.    Now the reason we broke up was because we fought a lot, but during the time we've spent apart i've been able to sit down and think about what was making us argue and work on the things that would help us in the long run. Unfortunately, its one thing to tell her that ive changed, its another to show her. I need a way to show her that ive changed and that we wont make the same mistakes with our relationship twice. Ive asked her to get lunch with me already, she thinks about it and then says no, that she cant see me. She seems very confused in what she wants...i want to be with her but what should i do?

20090131190327AAc7kCt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this what hubby love is all about nobody answered me a good enough answer?	I've been married to this guy basically living with him 2 years seeing him 24 7 everyday there isnt a second that goes by when he dont call me, at first i liked him as a friend then we where taken away ( was put in a mental clinic) i felt like my other half was missing and there was a hole in me and i couldnt stop crying missing him etc, two years went by we are still very close, still not a second goes by when i dont see him i feel like i developed a 'husband love' for him i am feeling it more often      on monday i felt a strong love lighter than in love ( like the begining of a relationship or infactuation) but i felt strong feelings of friendship love, love him as a family, and in love with him as a partner, per example when i looked into his eyes i felt we connected and we where one person, he is like my other half, he means alot to me i feel in love with him but a calmer in love like i never felt for anyone, like i know he is there every second and sometimes i take that for granted   anyway every time i feel this way husband love, the next day i think about what i felt on the last day and i feel feelings of in love ( like boyfriend girlfriend love) even though i did not feel in love only as a husband on monday is this normal to look back to what you have done together and feel strong feelings of love, even though at the present time you felt you only loved him as a hubby. is this normal?   i mean if the feelings i felt on tuesday or whenever i look back to what we did i feel the love is there, so it must be, right girls?   i just never been in such a serious relationship, and never been with someone so long, i always in the past went after guys that treated me like **** and when someone was too nice to me ( like he is) i tend to take them for granted, but putting that all aside i feel alot for him, i feel it in my heart. is this a normal way to feel about your husband, and if i felt the love is there bf gf love the sparks etc then it must be? even though i get them remembering back all we did together.

Ok, so I am a Junior at my school and one of my really good friends is a senior, who I like. We have been friends for year almost and are really close and we have classes together and talk all the time. The thing is I want to be more than friends. I haven't told him this and I don't know how.  On facebook  we message all the time & flirt. But I still get mixed messages from him. Is this a sign that he doesn't like me or does he feel the same way and just can't express it. Or is he just not that into me? I can't tell. If anyone has any advice please give it. This may sound childish but I'm juts stuck. TY.

20090226072515AARmnU7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend and Sexual Intimacy?	I am having difficulty understanding my girlfriend when it comes to sexual intimacy and it is really starting to bother me.      As of right now, we aren't having sex, which is fine by me, we are still building our relationship. We do however tend to do some sexual activities, such as grinding, using our hands, etc (no oral either). It seems however that most of the time that we do stuff, she stops into it saying she has a "guilty" feeling and doesn't want to continue. She says that she feels guilty doing it, because she was raised to think sex was bad (weren't we all). I respect that thought, but at the same time it just frustrates me.       One of the things that bothers me is she has had sex with at least 3 other guys that she has told me about. Why is it that she has this guilty feeling when me and her don't even have sexual intercourse, rather we just "mess around" if you will.      Another thing that bothers me is I have a really hard time figuring out when she wants to play around or not. A lot of the time she will do some things that I think is are hints that she wants to, and so i begin to pursue them with subtlety and then she turns right around and says "oh lets go do this or that". Its probably wrong that I think this, but I feel like she does it just to shoot me down. Another thing that I probably shouldn't think about or do though, is that I just feel like one of these days I want her to "want" me to do stuff, and then I just really want to shut her down and tell her "lets go do something else". I don't know maybe I just feel like she has taken all the power when it comes to sexual intimacy.      I tend to feel a little upset too after nights that we hang out and we don't do anything. I think there is something wrong with me too. I appreciate any advice you all can give me, thanks in advance! :)

Hi,      Almost three months ago my fiance was hit by a car on the crossing and she died in my arms, the very next day my fathers factory burned to a crisp loosing his life`s work.   Untill a few weeks my life was a living hell. In this period i met a gril who helped me get over this and recently, a few weeks ago we decided to become lovers, i liked her a lot. I thought if i do this it will help me to recover more quickly from the pain and get my life back on track.   When everything seemed ok, last night she told me that i am to good and care to much for her and she decident to leave me.    Right now i feel like the most miserable human beying on the planet.   This pain and suffering is killing me, i can`t stand it anymore, i feel like dying.      Can someone help me?    What would you do if you were in my place?

My husband and i divorced 8 years ago and we have 2 children 11 and 10..A year after we divorced he re married and we kept fighting cause he wanted to see kids and i didnt want his new wife around the kids.   He told me after 2 years that if i didnt let him see the kids he would stop paying me child support i told him i didnt want it and that he was not able to see the kids any more..   I am japanese we were married in japan and divorced in japan so i did that to save my children having to see and be with the new wife.   That was all 6 years ago now and i want to know if i can claim child support for the children now.He hasnt seen the kids in 8 years or paid any money i dont have a divorce decree like i say it was all done in japan but i have a american friend who says i can go to court if i travel to the states..Is this true   16 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.

20090226073449AA4ChP5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married and in love with a younger woman, what do I do?	Im 26yr old male who has been married for 7yrs and has a child. I got married when I was 21 and she was 18, (mostly) because she got pregnant. That’s just half the story, just about a 1yr ago my wife had an affair with another man for about 6mths. I blame it on my emotional distance I had built up between us. Well regardless during this time I had found shelter from a friend of ours. She is 9yrs younger than me. My wife and I eventually work things out and took marriage counseling but I couldn’t stop thinking about this other woman. We keep talking daily as friends until about five months ago we took it past friendship. Now I have been seeing her every week. I don’t know what to do I never been so confuse …I have research the difference between love, lust, and infatuation and come to determination it might be love. But I’m confuse does love come from people that cheat? Ugh Im truly not a bad person at least I seem to think so. I care for my wife but should I sacrifice true love so I can just be there physically for my wife and hope my love grows back?

He wants to control my whole life..and I want out! But he won't give me enough to survive on if I left. Not even enough to get me by until I find another job closer to my parents. He says that a judge can't do anything either...because he'll just hide any money or funds that is in the account. I want out now...and I don't know the first thing as to what I should do!!

20090131182102AApyRtd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why won't he respond to my messages?	So, I recently talked to this guy on an internet dating website, jdate. I haven't had much luck finding what I was looking for on this site, until this guy. We seem to have a lot in common and things seemed to be clicking online. After that first online conversation of a good hour (this was on a Sunday) he asked if I wanted to do anything that coming Friday. I said sure and he said great we'd be able to discuss the details later, he had to go.       Rather than exchanging contact info he added me as a friend on facebook. So Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday rolled around and I still hadn't heard anything. I sent him a casual message via facebook asking him if he was still interested in meeting up. The exact words were "Hey, I was wondering if you're still intereted in meeting up. Let me know."       After 3 days he replied back saying "hey-- sorry i've been a bit mia - i haven't had much free time this week and a friend of mine is visiting me from out of town. I'll let you know when things calm down here. take it easy and enjoy the rest of your weekend."       I replied back to this saying no problem, i hope to hear from him soon.    It's been 15 days and I haven't heard a response.       Does this mean I should just give up and take it as a sign that he's no longer interested? Maybe he's met someone else through the site? The only thing that confuses me is why he would reply to my message in the first place if he wasn't interested and why he would still leave it openended by saying he would contact me. He was the one to ask to meet up in the first place.      Any thoughts or suggestions on how to proceed, if at all, would be greatly appreciated.

20090131201159AA2cJyQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	From the moment my husband walks in the door, my stress levels skyrocket...?	My husband and I have been married for 28 months.  Of those 28 months we've actually been together for about 11 of them (due to a 15 month deployment, WLC, Air Assault, etc...he's Army).  We also have an 18 month old daughter.      Since he got back from his deployment 10 months ago, everything has been different.  Obviously the war in Iraq affected him in some ways, but the deployment affected me in ways I wasn't expecting and no one warned me about.      I'm constantly stressed when he's around, and ONLY when he's around.  From the moment he walks through the door, my stress levels skyrocket.  Every little thing he says and/or does could be the next thing to set off my next ***** fest or cry fest.  But when he's not home, I'm fine...I can go about my day and everything is normal.  With him home I feel like I lose all motivation to do anything...cleaning, cooking, running errands, taking care of our daughter, etc.  Its like he takes all the good out of me and leaves only misery.  I look forward to him going to work every day and I dread him coming home...even his phone calls (just talking to him) is enough to stress me out.  By stress, I mean this feeling that I'm getting hotter and hotter until I'm about to explode...and I physically get hot, I get tense, and my heart starts racing.  All of this caused by him walking through the door...that's it.  I can't sleep in the same bed with him anymore, so I've been sleeping on the couch.  I feel horrible about this and my husband asks me what's wrong sometimes, but I don't how to tell him without making him feel horrible too.      I wonder if this is deployment related.  It didn't start right after he got back, but it was soon after (about a month).  I know it has to do with my husband (obviously) and its not normal to be happy when he's gone and miserable when he's here.  I know I need to seek counseling, but I can't get into see anyone this late on a Saturday night and this is a 24/7 problem that I could use advice on now.  Do you have any insight?  Any ideas/tips/suggestions?  How do I deal with living in the same house with him if I feel like this when I'm around him?      (FYI: In case anyone is wondering, I'm not a violent woman and have not, and would not, beat on my husband or daughter.)

20090226075822AAzN5lW	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Anyone getting married on September 5th 09?	Thats my wedding date and I just wondered if anyone else was planning a wedding for September?   I've got the dress already, (still needs to be fitted for me) I bought it at a garage sale, it has never been worn, it still has the tags on it. I got it for $200, and its from davids bridal, so I figured I got a pretty good deal. We are on a pretty tight budget, cause we are also trying to buy a house! I'm making my own invitations, and I've got most of the paper cut out and ready to be assembled. We haven't found a place for the wedding or reception yet. We grew up in different towns, about 10 miles apart. We are thinking about getting married in the church in my town, and having our reception at the Firehouse (many people have done it there) in his town. It would be a free place to have it, we would just have to pay for the food, drinks, decor, etc. Sound like a good idea?  Im just ordering my flowers(silk) online. Im not a real girly girl, so flowers aren't that huge of a deal for me. They are cheap and from the pictures they are pretty. We have a dj in mind that $500 for the wedding and 4 hours for a reception. We haven't put a deposit down yet, cause we are still looking around.   But anyways.. I was just wondering what everyone else has planned so far? Am I behind? I know I still have a lot to pay for.. which is why im stressing a little, cause I just took a pay cut. But I guess thats better than losing my job! Thanks for reading lol

Please HELP I need it
20090226075037AAOqmXr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think I should do?	I have a really complicated relationship with this boy from my school. He asked me out last year over the phone in February. I said yes, but broke up with him after the weekend was over, because I really didn't like him like that at that time. 2 months later I started going out with a boy from my church and he got mad at me and tried to make me break up with my boyfriend. Well we broke up anyway at the end of the summer.       Finally he started texting me again when school started in September. He asked me out again and I said yes. Seven hours after we started going out he broke up with me because he was too busy with school and football to have a girlfriend. A week later he told me he didn't really think it was a good idea to break up with me. But, at that time I found out another boy from my church liked me and was planning on asking me out. He told me that if I didn't think it was going to work out between us I could go out with the other boy from my church. Well the church boy asked me out and I said yes. Again he got mad at me and tried to break me and my boyfriend up. After a month we broke up anyway, and I started going out with the school boy again. We start going on and off, on and off, on and off again though. Later on though we decided to have sex.      I love him, I would do anything for him, and I would even die for him.      We continued to date on and off. He is always the one who broke up with me, I only broke up with him once. I asked him why he broke up with me all of the time, and he said it was because people "made fun of him" while we were dating. I don't think that was 100% true though because I am pretty "popular" in my school and have a lot of "poular" friends. He's also not that "popular" because people make fun of him behind his back.      We got into many huge fights, but we always managed to patch it up and get back together, which I kind of take as a sign that maybe we're meant to be together. He is also kind of a jerk, he's mean to me in person, but nice to me when we're alone. He always thinks he's right and treats me like crap. On the other side though, when we're alone, he's also very romantic and passionate, which I love.       He always says he's going to go back out with me, but them comes up with an excuse and breaks his promises. He says he doesn't want a girlfriend right now, but wants to date me in summer, but I don't know whether to believe him this time or now, or not.      I just don't know what to do. He made me cry so many times, and had broken my heart so many times in so little time. I love him, I really do. Please help.

20090226074845AAImEft	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I Think I'm Depressed & My Gf is adding to the stress....?	Talk about disfunctional, I live with my gf who I care about but I don't love. She's stressed all the time because she's insecure in our relationship. I can't leave the house without her calling me several times just to see where I'm at and what I'm doing. Even when I am home, every time my phone rings she thinks it's another woman.      My finances aren't really in order. My job pays me ok, but some weeks I get 40hrs and sometimes I don't. I have two teenagers that I'm trying to take care of but bills at home are piling up and my gf just nags me about all of it. I'm overly irritable and the littlest things set me off.      I can't even perform sexually anymore. I can't get it up for my gf or my gf on the side. Whenever I go see my other gf all I do is get drunk and talk to her about my problems for hours and hours. She always where's something sexy whenever I'm there and tries to pleasure me but my mind is so preoccupied with whats wrong in my life I can't focus on performing for either of them. But when I'm alone I masterbate at least 3 times a week to porn. I can feel that I'm loosing both of them. I know that my gf I live with is the main source of my problems she demeans me and treats me as if I'm a little boy and not a man. I want to move out and move in with one of my boys but I don't want to feel like I'm abandoning her.      Can anyone give me some advice on how to get out of this depressing faze so I can live a normal life?
20090131200414AA2VOuH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In love with two... I don't know which one to choose?	Ok, so over the summer at scope (a summer activity thing) I met this guy... I wanted to hate him but for some reason I started to really like him... I can't figure out why, i mean all he did was tease me, and he's  (was) really pretty ugly... But I still felt so attached to him, and I hated myself for it. I am pretty sure that he liked me, he flirted with me and bugged me about nothing.      So then when the school year started, there was this other guy. He wore glasses, which I usually don't go for, but I felt attached to him too. I thought it would go away, but I still like him now. I used to heave regrets about it, but now I don't, so most of my friends know I like him. I started to really really like him, to the point where I don't care if he picks someone other than me, if that makes him happy.      So I went to the skating rink (spelling?) today. I saw this guy who i felt attached to... My first thought was that it was the guy who i met over the summer, but I didn't know. He had a totally diferent haircut, and even hair color, but it still felt like him. I did some "investigating" on him, and figured out it was the guy I met over the summer! I think he knew who I was too, because he skated slower when i started to fall further behind him, and looked at me a lot, and laughed when i was acting stupid (And we were all being weird and talking in 2nd person...). But he skated with a bunch of other girls and stuff, so I didn't know what to think... But about when I started to noticed the other girls and him, I felt jealous. Then I realized I liked him, without denying it as much. We didn't talk at all, but when i fell and crashed into him (on accident...) my heart was beating faster than it's ever done before, even with the guy I like at my school. So I have no clue which one I like better... it's so hard to choose!      I have 6 classes with the one I go to school with, and I know hime so much better. but he has a girlfriend right now...      The guy I knew over the summer (Did I mention we only really knew eachother for 3 weeks?) and saw at the skating ring,might have a girlfriend. Aside from that, I don't know hardly anything about him. I do know that he's 2 or 3 years older than me though. And he looks SO much better now. I'll see him for 3 more weeks during the summer, maybe see eachother more if I decide I like him best.      Really, I'm stuck now. I have loved the one at my school for so much longer than most people at my school can keep a crush. (One sided love?) I might be able to give him up to another girl, but I don't know about not liking him. He's the only thing I think about at night. (Acept for tonight). I think he likes me, too. My friends think he does, anyway. The one at the skating ring, I feel so weird with. I get butterflys, my heart beats like 15 times a second when I touch (Fall on or hug) him, so I think I might like him better... Or I might just be crushing on him a tiny bit... I have no clue.      Ok, last paragraph, I promise. Which one should I choose? I have no idea, I don't know which i like more, nothing is working for me!! I just want to be happy with one person... (And have any of you noticed this might make a great story?) OMG I DID NOT MEAN FOR IT TO BE THIS LONG!!! Sorry to make you read all of that!!! And thanks in advance! Especially if you actually read it all!

20090131201912AArVyeq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this action mean?	This guy I like and have been getting to know has been intriguing me.  We were hanging out last night for awhile and he continued to say over and over again, "I'm at the end of my chain and I'm barking." Finally, I asked him about it and he said, "you know, when a dog REALLY REALLY wants something, it is pulling at its chain and barking." Today, I was talking to him, and he kept biting at his lower lip.  Does that mean anything? Oh and he also kept saying "buhh" to his friend last night around me.
20090226080219AAmzraH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married people who have overcome an affair?	How did you get to trust your partner again if you were the cheated on spouse? And how did you gain trust again if you were the spouse that cheated?
20090131173303AA7gPMY	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What would you do in these two scenarios?	Its not as long as it seems! please read the scenarios and choose if you would do A>B>C>D. Thank you!      Scenario 1: It is three days before your wedding, and your fiance just had their bachellor/ette party last night. You come accross their cell phone see pictures and realize that the party got WAY out of hand. They had a stripper there and to put it simply it, went beyond touching. Its obvious that some sexual acts were performed. Horrified you:      A. Still marry him/her and try to ignore the photos and what happened, knowing you put so much work and money into the wedding just to cancel it 3 days before.   B. Talk to him/her and know that you love them and will marry them either way and hope that nothing like this would happen again.   C. Talk to him/her and realize that you cant marry someone who did this to you 3 days before your wedding and call the marriage off to think about the situation more.   D. Throw the ring at them and yell how much you are hurt and call the marriage off because they cheated on you.      Scenario 2: Lets say that you are a best friend to the groom/bride, and you run accross some pictures of the wild bachelor/ette party that their future spouse had (again, the photos are very wild, where sexual acts were performed etc). Would you:      A. Its not your business but theirs, and since you dont like to meddle in others personal issues, so you decided to ignore it and hope for the best.   B. Try to hint for them to talk to their spouse about it but not say what happened. Maybe they might get what happened, and I dont want to get too deeply in their personal matters.   C. Blatantly tell them what their future husband/wife did at their bachelor/ette party knowing they would want to think about marrying someone who cheated on them.      So what would you do?  :-)

20090226080043AA9OqkC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I help this along?	My boyfriend somewhat broke up with me a week ago.   We've been in contact just about every night.   I sent him probably too many long messages and was not only feeling guilty, but desperate. I read lots of advice online and found better ways to give him space.      It's not that he doesn't find me attractive and he doesn't hate me, he just says he doesn't feel the same. Like a combination of things over the course of our 2yr relationship.      I have fessed up to a lot of things. I have cried, I've apologized, I've told him I'm changing (and I definitely am for the better). I just find myself wanting another chance so badly. I have since not been messaging or calling him and last night he sent me a text message asking me how my day was with an old nickname. He doesn't even like sending text messages! Unfortunatley when I talked to him later that night he sounded as monotone as usual and told me he got his phone wet and just letting me know if I send him messages he can't get them. (I know this isn't a lie or an excuse for me to not text him...I haven't been anyway).      When I was asking him about us a few days ago he said he doesn't know how he'll feel a few days from now or even a week from now. Basically he's dealing with a lot of things in his life and the way he communicates (or doesn't) just isn't helpful to me.      So we're going bowling Frdiay night (something we did in the beginning of our relationship). I don't want to feel even worse after we hang out and that there is no hope for us. I got a new haircut and will wear a cute outfit but How can I make the night as best as possible without hating that I'm dropping him off at his house?       Any advice about anything I typed here would be great! Please don't bring me down too much! Thank you!

20090226074903AAO5Fvw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think porn has made men 'bad' (or one dimensional) in bed?	Porn is fantasy and much of that - for men - is about immediate penetration (whether the woman is ready or not is irrelevant) and pumping hard and fast. Many times the only variety you may see is the number of people involved, different races, etc. However, if you squint, you are pretty much seeing the same thing over and over again - hard, fast, hard fast...      Because many of us learned a lot about sex by watching porn, do you think guys (in particular) have learned that 'hard/fast' in various positions is what constitutes 'a good lay'?       Hard and fast is good - sometimes, but honestly most women don't have orgasms that way or from penetration alone. And after a while that begins to be numbing of mind and body. Just curious...

20090226074621AAq2nvg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you be real with yourself?	hypothetical scenario: Your girlfriend or boyfriend (notice i did not say husband/wife) was in a sever car accident. They are now crippled from head to toe. They can no longer speak or perform daily functions, including using the restroom alone, walking or sex. You have always regarded this person as the love of your life, who you would one day marry. Does this change your plans, or do you stay with this person? To be fair, I'll answer first. I would always hold a friendly relationship with her, but would no longer consider marrying or being a significant other. Sorry if that's too "shallow" of me. How about you?
20090226074728AAeqIjd	Family & Relationships;Family	My 2 teenage daughters are just awful to me! Any suggestions for discipline?	My 15 and 16 year old daughters are talking back and being difficult. I took their phones, Ipods, and allowance away. The 15 yr old was grounded all last weekend, yet they both continue to defy me. Over and over! What else can I do?      I am reprimanding one child and the other tells me to stop talking to her and I told her to keep her mouth shut, that I'm the mother, not her. I ask them to pick up their rooms, over and over, and they do everything but. I'm just so tired of this. Then they expect their father and I (we are divorced and I am remarried), to drive them back and forth between houses (when they forget something) because of poor planning on their part.       I'm sure they are 'typical', but I need some new stuff to hit them with. What I'm doing ISN'T WORKING!!

20090226075826AAyxPLn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Have you been married more than 20 years? Are you in love?	My husband and I are not in love. We have two small children. He wants and needs very different things than I do. Mostly, he just doesn't really need me, and that hurts. We both want out of this marriage, but we can't afford two households. So we're considering working on the marriage just for the kids. I think he has too many crappy behaviors that would have to change for us to work, but we have to give it a try for our kids.       Is there love out there? If I divorce him, I would hope to find love again some day. If I stay with him, I'll never really be loved. Does love exist? I'm just wondering. Can you tell me about your experiences? I'd prefer only to hear from people who have been married a while, or people who found love later in life, and had it last.       (I know there's no such thing as perfect, but I want someone who will at least consider my feelings before acting. My husband always, always puts other people or his desires before mine. It made me feel small and insignificant. I never want to feel that way again.)
20090226075806AAjjQK0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Friends with beneficial wonders?	Is not what I want, but there was this whole ordeal with a guy friend I had and I'm not sure if I handled it all that well.   It started with me giving him my number. Just because we were friends and nothing more.....but then he texted me a lot that day (I now hate texting convos with a dying passion.) and somehow he got to the    question of asking me if I thought it was possible for us to become friends  with benefits. So I said maybe it could work. Which was stupid. But that's what I thought I wanted until a weekend went by and I basically rejected his idea of us hanging out at the mall and ignored his texts.   I came to realize that I thought he was a disgusting pig who has admitted to the fact that he likes to be an ahole for people's reactions    and leads girls on for fun. So I'm not/never was attracted to him in any way whatsoever. Yet I found fun in the fact that I was sort of leading him on and dissmissing every invite he gave me to go anywhere with him at all. Oh, and, ignoring his stupid goodnight texts.   Yesterday he texted me around 3:00 asking me what's up and I didn't answer until 6:00 saying:: I changed my mind about the whole being friends with anything at all.      so he said:: Yea I kinda guessed that      and then I said:: Ok well...I guess that's it. See you later   then he texted back saying "yea I guess" and that was it. Today I see him around school and we're both basically avoiding each other....   so, did I handle this correctly? Or was I somewhat rude? Give me your honest opinions!
20090131155526AAMoVtu	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I propose ___?	to my girlfriend of a year. I'm 22 and she's 21. She's very beautiful & a great person. It's like she just fell into my life one day. Like fortune & luck smiled on me. When she came into my life she took me by storm, I didn't even know it was possible to love someone that much, my whole life changed for the better and it doesn't seem like it's ever going to stop. She's way out of my league and if she didn't approach me, I would haven't had ever gotten to know her. She's talented and music inclined. Doesn't drink, doesn't do drugs. Intelligent. Confident. Wise. Tasteful. She's not a sl*t. She plans on becoming a psychologist. We both lost our virginity to each other. We've talked about kids, I told her I one day want to start a family with her, have 2 kids and get married. Which ever comes first. She doesn't believe in abortions, neither do I. She came from religious back grounds, doesn't believe in cheating or adultery. She's good with kids and kids love her, when we are in public it's like kids and babies gravitate to her, they look at her, smile, laugh, they like her a lot, she loves animals. Our sex life is great, she's not afraid to try new things, outgoing. I'm so attracted to her, I always get an erection around her and she's the only one who can distract me so much, I almost crashed twice because of it, she's so cute. She over looks my flaws and my looks (which are far from perfect) She's so cute and fun to be around with, she babies me every now and then. Motherly (which I like) Like when I was sick she made me some tasty chicken soup from scratch and delivered it to me. She always looks out for my health (she's a health nut as well lol) and says for me to take my vitamins or take a nap when I'm feeling sick. She looks out for me when I'm not. We just went to the next step and moved in together, now I'm wondering if I should make the next move and propose or if I should wait another year. She's so great, I can't even put it all down in writing how awesome a person she is on top of being gorgeous and I just don't want to let her slip away from my grasp so some other lucky guy can take her hand. Right now, we are deeply in love and I know she could be with other guys, guys much better looking then me that make more money and live fancier lives but she is with me for me and who I am. And she gives me 110% of herself to me. I don't want to make her wait but should I give it more time? what do you think? This woman means everything to me, if she were to not be in my life I would physically and emotionally be devastated & ill, I might not ever be the same again or love like I did to her again.

20090131200932AA3ziLm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Everything points to him cheat, how do I confront him about?	I have been dating my boyfriend for a few months and during the past two weeks I noticed him getting texts every night from another girl.  I thought nothing of it at first for I am not the jealous types, but one day I noticed that she was asking if he wanted to meet up and he said sure.  Stupid me didn't say anything at the moment for I wanted to believe that it was an innocent friendship thing for I myself have a lot of guy friends.  Then he became distant and when he would leave from hanging out with me would text her all night long.      I don't have solid evidence that he has done anything with her, but I wanted him to know that I knew because I don't want to be played if he does decide to see her.  I just don't know how to bring it up calmly and not accusing him so quickly.      Thanks for the help

Ok well there is   a lot of drama to this story and im not good with drama because I try to stay away from it ..Ok well it all starts back in August of 08.. Well I was engaged to the guy Im now dating.. we had an on again off again relationship..During 1 of our off again times I messed around with an ex of mine.. and then me and my fiance get back together about 2 days later to then brake up again until the day after Christmas.. during this time i find out that I am 5 months pregnant..which is really bad because now I don't know who the father is between the 2 guys.. well now me and my former fiance are back together and he knows that there is a possibility that the baby may not be his.. but he told me regardless that he would stay.. well i Just have found ot he has sold my engagement ring that I had given back to him and here recently i have been dropping hints that I still wanna marry him and I want to be engaged again but he just tells me to go buy my own ring and makes jokes that he would rather "screw the system" because Im getting government help because Im not married.. Not to mention I have recently moved in with him so I know hes wanting a serious relationship.. what do you think his intentions are by the sound of it. and do you think he will ever marry me =( ???
20090131200205AA970gw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I talk about having sex with my girlfriend of over a year?	Alright so here is my situation,   I am almost 20 years old and I have been dating this girl for about 18 months. I am a virgin (not by choice) and so is she. The only time we have talked about sex is one time while we were making out earlier in our relationship, and things got a little hot, she asked me if I have ever had sex. I answered truthfully and that has been the extent of our sex talk. We go to different colleges so I don't see her as much as I would like.   I'll be honest, I really want to have sex, but I don't know how to bring it up to her. I guess what I'm asking is if anyone else has been in a similar situation or have any tips for me as to what I should say/do.   Thanks for the help
20090131194143AAYfOWH	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this too brutal to say to my parents?long question!?	okay, so i'm engaged and my parents are very strict and over protective. all we do is fight.THIS IS GOING TO BE LONG! I'm 16 and i can't go to parties. If i go to a friends house, when she drops me off, she walks me to the door. while i'm there, i can't be anywhere but the livingroom, kitchen or bathroom. I'm engaged, but when my fiance is over, we can't even lay on the floor or couch and watch a movie together. i can't be out past 10. if i'm out with a friend from around my house, i have to be home by dark, which right now means 5. i can't be in a car with anyone except my family or people over the age of 21. when i have friends over we can't chill in my room, it has to be the livingroom where she can watch us. if my fiance is over, we have to sit with at least 3 inches of space between us and he isnt even allowed to put his arm around my shoulders.      so the only way i can really get away is by just leaving one day. my fiance and i are moving in together in the summer but if i told my parents they wud freak and never let me see him anymore. so slowly im taking my stuff to the apartment and stuff. but on the day i actually leave, i'm just leaving and this is the note im leaving...      Dear Mom and Dad,   I called you earlier and said I was going out. I did go out but, I’m not coming home. I’m in a safe place not too far away and this is my new home. I’m not telling you where it is yet because I do NOT want to come back. I know if I had told you I was leaving you would have stopped me, and if you knew where I was right now you would come get me. But, no matter what, when I was living with you guys I was always in a bad mood. I went to school for one reason, to escape for a while. It’s not enough anymore. I’m not happy and haven’t been for a long time. The only time I can be a little bit happy is when I’m not at home. All it is, is fighting and that is not the kind of environment I want to subject myself to. I have major headaches all the time but when I get to leave for a bit, they go away. That must say something. I need space and I need silence. It is never quiet at home. The air is filled with complaints and orders. I want to do things on my own now. I am in a good place where I will probably be for a long time. I can be happy here. I haven’t been able to be happy in a long, long, long time. I basically forgot how it even feels. I know why that is too, and you probably get what I mean. I can’t fight anymore. Nothing I do is good enough, I can’t get the grades I did in elementary school. The work is ten times harder and a lot more is expected. Even in elementary school my best wasn’t good enough. I can’t stand living at home. That is why I stayed upstairs so much. I get pissed off so easily no matter what. It’s just hard being around the negative energy all them time. Before it gets worse and I want to be gone for good and never look back(which I’m pretty close to already), I’m going to make this easier by ensuring we won’t be at each others throats 24/7 anymore. I appreciate all you have done for me like the puppies, tattoo and raising me but now it is time for me to leave. I need and crave the responsibility and individuality you get living away from home. Plus, everything has just finally built up and it’s just gotten to be too much. You will most likely think I’m selfish, and that this is immature but it’s what I need to do. You will not be able to find me so don’t try. If you call the cops, they can’t do anything now because of my age. If they bring me back, I’d just leave again anyway. If you tried bringing me back, I’m not going to lie here, I’d hate you and leave again and again until you got the point. I don’t want to come back. I don’t want to be found. When I am ready to, I will contact you. I will be continuing my education so that won’t be an excuse to bring me back either. I left my phone here because a long time ago, mom told me that if I ever moved out, my phone had to stay here. There is actually good from this too. Mom, remember when you and I were talking and you said, "when you are 18 and have moved out…..", well congrats, I’ll already be long gone. So again, do not try and find me, I will contact you when I’m settled and ready. Do not try and bring me back, I’m not coming back and I’ll just leave again but be even farther away. I am safe and happy(finally). Goodbye.         do u think its too mean?
20090131200216AAHDu7U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for all you girls 15 or younger?	I notice all these questions on here from a lot of you about dating and looks. Why? Why can't you girls enjoy being young? You shouldn't care how you looked at 15 as far as "do you think I'm pretty am I to fat, why won't my bf make out with me?" This is crazy you need to step back and look at the way you're behaving!! You have your whole life ahead of you to date and wear makeup and kiss boys why can't you just worry about getting through school and making a life for your self. Please know I am only 26 and I have 3 YES 3 girls and it scares the crap out of me that this is the way 15 year old or younger behave.      I know your young and all young girls want to fit in and be popular but do you think when you get in the real world that it is for one second gonna matter who you hang out with now or what you wear or how skinny you are or aren't. It doesn't. How many of you on a daily basis have the same goal, To graduate Go to college start a career then worry about finding mr right and starting a family? Be honest when you answer that part of this.

20090131201235AALnHRZ	Family & Relationships;Family	Serious problems with my mom?	A note before you start analyzing, and nailing me with armchair phycology. Well, I'm very very distressed. Now please don't take me for being immature, maybe I am but you must realize the circumstances.       First and foremost let me tell you of my slightly depressing situation. My mother has been dating the same man for 2 years. I hate this man with every spec of my soul - It's not even the fact that my mom's "dating" someone (as she puts it!) Even as evidence, I LOVE my dads girlfriend, LOVE LOVE LOVE her! I'm not going to begin to describe why I dislike him, but it's just not good. Anyways, enough rambling eh?       Ever since my mom has been dating him she's changed a lot, and for the worse. She's so selfish and self-centered. Her whole personality changed, and her perspective of things. For example our house is untidy and unkept unless I tend to it, she used to clean twice a week, but now she's to busy with her boyfriend, and she expects me to do all the housework. She used to be family oriented - but I am eating the majority of my meals alone. She makes my schedule revolve around hers. She constantly complains how "Busy" she is and that I don't help enough. (Mind you I'm the only one that cleans, and does Maintenance around the house.) This list goes on, and on, and on! She used to be what some would call the idealistic mother, and now I don't even know what she is! I can't help but scream.      She keeps talking about him moving in, and she knows I hate him, I've told her thousands of times why I show such dislike for him and she always ends our conversations with "I'm happy with him it isn't about you." I just am very depressed and don't know where to turn, I feel invisible. She claims she's waiting for him to move in when I leave [Go to college] so that way it won't "bother" me, but it still does, and she knows that!       Just before I go further please realize that yes, I do really really hate this man, she knows that! I will *not* be able to live in the same house as him. I'm not being irrational or rebellious either, just understand that?       I'm rambling because I'm particularly sad right now, I'm sorry, forgive me. I don't know where to start, what do you suggest? How do I talk to her? Should I move in with my dad? Why has she changed so much? Am I really the one who's being selfish?

20090226080215AAHVfQi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend really a jerk? Or is it me?	So me and my boyfriend have been together for about 6 months, still young age wise and things have been up and down with us. When we have our good days, they are really good and we have many of them. He like's to keep some of his feeling inside... for example when he gets upset he dosen't like to say anything other than "i'm fine" which kinda upsets me because a relationship should be open and we should be able to communicate with eachother. I know he really likes me because of what he say's but when we have our bad days I feel like I can't go to him because when I do he gets deffensive and angry even when im not yelling. The only thing he really says when we talk is " yup, ok, sure, mhm" and Im the one who does all the talking and when I don't he says something like " what you not gunna fu**** talk now? " I don't know what he is thinking because sometimes he dosne't share things. He got into a really bad accident last year and people say after the accident he has changed and become kinda of a jerk and I don't know how he was before it but I don't know what to do because I do want this to work and I know he does but yet I feel he isn't ready to come out fully? or I don't know maybe he is having second thoughts... just something with this dosen't add up and we have tryed talking and after we do things work out for a while then i'm back at the " theres something wrong " point.... but yet he say's there no woman like me and if he lost me he wouldn't know what to do.. he says sometimes how he feels but doesn't show it as much, only sometimes but its always either one. He use to smoke but there were problems that were going on with him and he wanted to quit but needed a reason to and he has done it for 3-4 years and he asked me if I would want him to and I said yes because I want his health better so he quit and the only time he has done it is after we had a fight, but other than that I know he is honest with me with everything and straight out with me but sometimes he acts controling like it's his way or the high way sometimes but yet he says nice things and acts nice with me sometimes... I dont know its just a little werid, so if anyone can help me I really would appricate it.

20090131201501AAbFrsZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do with this girl (please answer)?	I'm looking for suggestions for what I could do with this girl I'd like to get to know better. The only catch is that she has a bf, so I don't know what would be good so we get to know each other better but also isn't inappropriate. I am interested in her beyond friendship but I doubt anything will happen (well, not right away at least). I do know she likes me and finds me attractive so it's not like anything will never happen but I have no intention of helping her cheat on her boyfriend (ie. if it turns out she does want more than friendship then she'll have to end it with her bf). And it's not like I'll be hoping that they'll break up; I will try to date other girls but I'd still like her to know that I like her (though I'm not gonna play it too easy, I hear that girls don't like that). Thanks for any suggestions and keep the "your scum" comments to a minimum.

20090131171327AA88KlU	Family & Relationships;Family	A question for all the parents?	I am 21 and don't worry I haven't done any of these or have any of these. I am just curious.    What would you say is the first thing that you think of when you think of or find out that you daughter is pregnant?    If they are getting married at 18?   If you kid has a STD that they got from someone else?   When they first start to drive?   When they get a boyfriend or girlfriend?   When it comes to "the talk" some parents don't want there kids to learn about the sex and body info at school, but then the parents are always too scared or chicken out of telling it to their kids, so they end up just learning it in school anyway. My question is why do you parents sometimes get mad when the schools what to teach the kids about sex and stuff and their body, when you sometimes can't even get the nerve to even talk to your kid yourself?   What to you do when you find out that your kid does drug or is alcoholic, either doing it to be cool or doing it because they are angry or depressed because of something that goes on in the family?   If you child has an abortion because they are afraid that you would hate them or kick them out of the house? (even though you love them, you are just upset that they would even do that)   If they caused a car wreck and they got hurt?    If you found out that your kid has trouble making friends?   I am just curious about how the parents think and feel when it comes to their kids growing up and being around things that you may not approve of. When I go to answer questions that young people ask, either about sex, or parents or, babies, or anything else. I alway tell them that they need to talk to you guys, because you love them and you may be upset at first when they tell you but you still want to be their for them. That you guys have gone though a lot of this stuff too, maybe. That you are older and smarter, that you guys just want to be their for them. I think that if kids and parents just kept calm and actually talked to eachother and didn't try to hide things. Then you and your kids would be a lot closer and they would feel that they have to hide from you. I have a lot of friends that are close to their parents because their parents let them have a life but at the same time give them rules to follow. Yes I know I typed a lot. Anyway I am just curious.

20090131202304AAQbkWS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I was so embarrassed. he made out with me when i least expected it =/ ?	Me and my boyfriend have been going out for a week now. He's 16 and I'm 15. We hung out last night. We usually just kiss. He made out with me last night though. I really did not expect it and i basically freaked out. It was my first time actually making out with a guy. It wasn't such a great experience, i mean freaking out in the middle of making out and like not knowing what to do anymore. :S We kind of talked about it later. I told him he really caught me off guard, which is pretty much why it didn't go so well. I'll probably see him soon again, but i'm not sure how i'll react. He told me he didn't want to make out if i didn't want to. But i actually do. I just don't want to freak out again. What should i do next time, or what should i tell him?

20090131175052AAguZ0l	Family & Relationships;Family	Is my mom overreacting?	I've always been a fan of body art, but I would never get real ink on my body because of my huge fear of needles. Therefore I resort to temporary tattoos (childish but fun to do). The other day I went to buy a few with my mom, and she looked worried and disgusted. I know she dislikes tattoos and piercings, but she looked freaked out. (She also dislikes my music - since I love Nirvana, and thinks that if I hear Teenagers by MCR I will immediately start hanging around with druggies). Curiously, the only other people in the store were a little boy and his mom (they were looking at action figures) and a couple that was looking at necklaces.       When I needed a few dollars to pay because what I had wasn't enough, I asked my mom to lend me some money. She refused and dragged me out of the store, saying that what I was buying was abnormal and that she wanted me to see a psychologist.       Do you think she was overreacting?

She used my phone to talk to him when I was talking to one of my friends who I might never see again. She told me 15 min. And she went overtime. ( I don't have unlimited)   I told her to give me my phone cuz 15 min were over and she hung up and chased me with a belt and spanked me really hard.   I asked why can't we just talk about this? Listen to my side of the story! Please. And she just said shut up You will listen to me and spanked me again. I went to my room crying and locked the door. I mean...I just found out she had a boy friend and she's expecting me to think that's perfectly fine. I take care of my sisters every weekend and she doesn't pay me. School isn't going too well I have straight D's even if I try. She doesn't believe I'm going through a lot. My parents are divorced. And she's curently knocking on my door really hard right now!

20090131201452AAUgQqF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should a guy be in the position to force his girlfriend not to talk to her ex?	My girlfriend insists that her relationship with her ex is nothing more than a friendship. However, I don't think that it's a good idea to stay friends with your ex if you're moving forward with a new relationship. I find it especially offensive, since she admitted they were intimate.       After giving her an ultimatum, she ceased communicating with him, but if it's not really coming out of her heart to stop talking to him, is it really the best solution? She said it didn't really make any difference to her, and that she doesn't care to be with him, but I'm just upset that she had to make it such a big deal.       Am I doing the right thing or should I run for my life?

20090131144112AAg7oFC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I divorce him?	My husband of two and half years is very wired.   He was showing me he is a nice guy before we got married, now after he is totally different. He has good qualities too, that’s why I’m struggling to stay with him thinking he’ll change his wired way. He takes care of me well, dropping me to work early mornings, taking me to doctor etc. We are living in USA. Originally from India.   Bad things are these,      He doesn’t like to visit any friends from our country; I’m in a very uncomfortable social situation, as I always have to refuse their invitations, and I also have to stay away as I’m not telling bad about him to any one.   He doesn’t like me talking to my parents (overseas) more than once a week, even if it is there call or me calling them. He has no interest at all to call his parents.   I can’t think about my family members dearly or say any good things about them he says I’m too much involved.   If my parents are here in USA, I need his permission to bring my father for a visit   To our place. Otherwise he fights with me after and totally ignores him when he is there.   He never talks to me in our Language, which he used a lot before we married, and force me to talk in English all the time and never to mention any word from our native language.   All these things a so much stress to my mind. I was a free girl, with lot of friends back in my country. I have no friends here because of my husbands behaviour, only a few people I got to know at work.   I feel like he lives in a cove and wants only me inside. I think(I don’t know) It’s hard for him to live without me.   I’m a strong girl I try to bare every thing even though it’s very hard at times. I try to think these are ups and downs. Some times I think whether it’s a sickness he has, if it is we can get a medicine.   I need your ideas my friends…..Should I stay and try more? We don’t have kids yet.
20090131144841AAwppGs	Family & Relationships;Family	How do we find help paying bills?On state assistance. 3kids ages 4&under. Husband 22yrs=$9/hr.Me 25yr=student.?	I am a 25 year old stay-at-home mother/ full time college student working towards an associate in Early Childhood Education. My husband is 22 years old and works full time as a C.N.A. in a nursing home. We have three children ages 4 and under. Evalyn is 4, Berlin is 3, and Joesph is 18 months.         Joe and I have been together since he was a Junior in high school (8years) and have been married for almost 5 years. We have worked very hard to provide our children with a home and were finally able to get out of government housing about 2 years ago when we assumed the loan on my aunt and uncle's house. We qualified for the Kansas weatherization program last year so our home is warmer then it was last year, but we still worry about being able to pay for heating.         Anyway, we aren't lazy or freeloaders. We were both working full time and (barely) paying our bills each month until my work said they couldn't afford to keep me. Instead of looking for another minimum wage job, I enrolled in college. I am making a 3.8 GPA and will graduate in 2010.        Because my husband only makes $9.00/hour, we have been falling behind on all of our bills by about $150 each month. We haven't been able to make the minimum payments on any of our credit cards (we've been thankful to pay our mortgage) and now they have been canceled and turned over to collections. We cant pay the amounts they want us to pay for the payment plans they have offered (which is more than our minimum payments were) and they are adding late fees and over the limit fees each month.         We are now on food stamps, WIC, Medical (for the children), and we qualified for LIEAP, but none of these agencies help pay bills. We were told that because Joe works full time, we cannot qualify for cash assistance. I was so desperate to help pay our bills, that I started filling out online surveys for .50 each. We don't have money to try any of those crazy on-line schemes.        If you have any real suggestions that can help our family before we end up losing our home and having to return to government housing, we'd really appericiate it! Thanks for your time.

20090226074553AAy7ZCe	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do to gain my parents' trust?	This is really hard to explain...my parents REALLY don't trust me. I am 20 years old and I come from a culture where marriages are arranged. Their marriage was arranged and they never saw each other till they got married. So they expect the same. Which I wouldn't mind except they've always wanted me to marry guys 10 years older than me who have nothing in common with me. Anyway, i am a pre-med student and I spend hours studying. This semester I have such a stressful semester, that I have not slept enough since school started and I haven't been able to sleep in once on the weekends. But my parents want me to be home and not study in the library, but still get straight As, come home and cook, clean, and socialize with my family. My dad honestly said he thinks there is something wrong with me because I have to study so much to get A's...he's like no one else has to study as much as you. Anyway, so they think that in fact I am at school partying and that's the real reason I am at school so much, when in fact I can spend eight hours at my chair in the library just studying.So last night my lab partner called and asked me some questions about our lab and he was making some jokes so I started laughing. And my dad heard and went and told my mom that I was talking to a guy and they had this little conference with me where they told me that if I do anything that shatters their confidence (whcih I am not sure they have much of anyway) in me they will do something that I will regret for the rest of my life. ( I think send me overseas or marry me off.) Here's the thing...if i was hiding something from my parents I would not have talked to that guy in hearing distance of my parents. i would have been quiet and I would not have let them heard. But I had nothing to hide. Everyone says talk to them. Trust me...I've tried. They don't care what I have to say. Its their way or the highway. This has been the situation all my life, but its finally getting to me to the point where I am breaking out, I am losing hair, I can't concentrate, and I literally feel sick to my stomach all the time. I don't know what to do. I should be studying neurosicence and dinstead I am writing this. Please help!
20090226074654AAe2yUN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know when you like someone?	There's a guy in my history class, ever since the first day of classes started I noticed him and he noticed me. The first class he sat across the room opposite me. The next class we had he sat directly in front of me and we would talk, flirt and laugh. Just this monday he asked me for my phone number. I was a little reluctant  at first but I gave it to him.      We've been talkin ever since. Yesterday we went out to lunch at Panera, I made sure I paid for my own because I didn't want him to pay and then it's like I owe him something later on. We sat down and ate and it was different seeing him in that type of enviornment.       I texted him later and he said that lunch was cool.      I guess I really just want to know is this attraction on both ends? By me sometimes initiating to talk to him first is that wrong? Is there really an interest between the two of us because I think I'm growing to like him.

Before you ask, we've been dating for almost a year and I honestly love her with all my heart. Okay, well I'm going to ask her to come with me on a road trip and while we're driving I will grab her hand and slip the ring onto her ring finger and hold it up to her face. Does that sound cute? I plan on taking her out to dinner to a VERY nice restaurant and renting a room at this amazing Bed & Breakfast (the room is NOT for sex, we are waiting for marriage together).

20090226080035AA9BYzk	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How do I handle the alienation that my BF does whenever his daughter is over for visits?	This ordeal is not unheard of sadly.  I've been living with my boyfriend for two years now.  We get along 85% of the time beautifully.  However, the other 15% of the time is pure miserable and it's whenever we have his daughter for visitation.  He builds this separate alliance between he and his daughter against my two boys and me (as if we're all competing against one another.)  It's as though my boys and I don't exist at all to the point where he's moody and sometimes mean.  I give him and his daughter space and when I do, my BF will ask me why I'M alienating him.  I can't win for losing here.  I've talked with him and he gets very defensive and walks out on me.  He refuses to calmly discuss what is happening with our blended family.  I tell him (as I once read) that a step-family is only as strong as it's couple.  But it seems lately like he's resenting me for whatever reasons.  I"m confused and torn.  Any thoughts, suggestions?  Thank you.

20090226080418AAgMzeN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Having an affair, stressed out beyong belief?	About a month ago I started having an affair with a woman I had met through a work project.  The two of us instantly clicked and it quickly evolved into a sexual relationship.   The problem is that I feel that the "other woman" and I have a far better connection than my wife and I have ever had.   I admit that I married probably a bit too you.  The problem has become that due to the stress of the relationships, the stress from an intense work schedule, and financial stress (thanks to the economy..)....   I'm getting to the point that I feel like I'm breaking down.    Normally I don't care about other people's opinions, but in this case I'm opening it to the masses to see what people think about this, and see if maybe I can find a solution.

20090226080714AAThOrT	Family & Relationships;Family	My parents are blaming my spouse?	We aren't married yet, but my boyfriend and I are raising a family. He has a six year old daughter from a previous marriage and I am currently 31 weeks pregnant. He works full time and I was going to school full time, working part time, and taking care of my step-daughter while he worked. Recently my doctor told me to go on "partial bed rest" because I've been nearly collapsing from exhaustion.      My boyfriend and I talked it over and he said he'd support me in any decision I made. After a couple days I decided it'd be best if I stopped school for the semester. Well, now my parents are really angry and blaming him for me dropping this semester. I plan on going back next semester but they don't believe me. I tried explaining that it wasn't his fault and the decision was mine. They say I am putting all my energy into raising his daughter, but I consider her my daughter...not just my step-daughter. She's not an obligation for me.       I feel like they're being a little hypocritical, too. My mother was a single mom before my dad. He took on raising my sister and my dad's parents weren't accepting of my sister at all. Now, they're treating my daughter like my grandparents treated my sister.       What are your thoughts? Opinions? Should I even try to make them see that he's not to blame? Please no rude comments.

My husband just found out this morning because of the economy, his job isn't as stable as it was.  He has the opportunity at another position... A great position but it means he'd be more or less living 1000 miles away  for weeks at a time.  Our relationship is very, very strong but I'm just not sure how to handle this.  We've never been apart before.  We bought our house 10 years ago so we don't want to lose it.  I have a great job here and I don't want to lose it either with the way the economy and jobs are right now either.  I've been at my job for 5 years and I know I'd never get a position like the one I have right now if I left to go with him.      What would you do if you were put in this position? We'd never even consider this if the economy wasn't where it's at right now.  Like I said, we've never even been apart more than overnight in the time we've been married but our relationship, at least, is very strong so I think we can handle pretty much anything.... I just don't want to have to do this.

I can't leave the house without her calling me several times just to see where I'm at and what I'm doing. Even when I am home, every time my phone rings she thinks it's another woman.

I have two teenagers that I'm trying to take care of but bills at home are piling up and my gf just nags me about all of it. I'm overly irritable and the littlest things set me off.      I can't even perform sexually anymore. I can't get it up for my gf or my gf on the side. Whenever I go see my other gf all I do is get drunk and talk to her about my problems for hours and hours. She always where's something sexy whenever I'm there and tries to pleasure me but my mind is so preoccupied with whats wrong in my life I can't focus on performing for either of them. But when I'm alone I masterbate at least 3 times a week to porn. I can feel that I'm loosing both of them. I know that my gf I live with is the main source of my problems she demeans me and treats me as if I'm a little boy and not a man. I want to move out and move in with one of my boys but I don't want to feel like I'm abandoning her.      Can anyone give me some advice on how to get out of this depressing faze so I can live a normal life?

20090226081203AA3jM7U	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help; my husband needs to lose weight but he doens't even try?	my husband is getting bigger and bigger each year and I really want him to be healthier and plus its more attractive when he isn't soo big, we fight about this a lot and I know I don't address it properly but he does't even try to eat right, he just says he loves food and thats that, he eats way to much take out and I don't know what to do.  I have tried getting him to take different kinds of diet related pills not really diet pills themselves cause they are unhealthy but other things that help with metabolism and he will take them but as far as regulating what he eats he just wont'.  what can I do.  I am always worried he is gonna die young from this and I have told him but he just says he would rather live in the moment which I think is a cop out.

20090131195608AA0Dvb7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy I like but  I have to initiate conversation?	Ok theres this guy I like a lot,we used to work together,well it was really hard to tell if he liked me or not! He can seem shy at times,Im friends with him on myspace,I havent seen him in months but I try to initiate convo on myspace,it was just his bday,I found some courage and sent him a message saying happy bday sexy and also told him I think hes really cool so he didnt say anything he just sent me his number and invited me to his bday party and said call me and let me know if you can come,I sent him a message saying I should be able to come but I had work that day,well I was unable to go! I sent him a message saying sorry I couldnt come to the party,well I was unable to call cause my new cell has horrible reception!!! So I still try to keep in touch on Myspace but I always initiate conversation! He always responds back to me but never messages me. Well he kinda mentioned to me a while back that his hair is thinning and it bothers him,hes only 26,well I think he may be a little insecure,should I keep messaging him or just give up? I noticed on myspace he will put music I like on his page and write stuff almost in reaponse to me on his page but he doesnt message me first,I know he knows i like him,the problem at work was we were always surrounded by other people,Im better one on one,Should i just keep messaging him,and complimenting him or will this scare him away? Does it sound like he likes me. At first I was soooo shy around him but now I push myself to talk to him,maybe he shy too??? I dont know many other guys tell me Im hot,but he hasnt,although he did shoot me in the butt with a rybber band and I caught him staring at my thighs when I was wearing shorts,HELP Im insanely attracted to and I want him in the worst/best way!!!!!

20090226080539AAEh5XY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Whats wrong with my friends?	i have two friends i dont get along with...both of them are pisces, i think they have a problem with me, everytime i give my opinion or say something they have to contradict my view. i feel like giving them a piece of my mind some day.. both of them side eachother on every occasion and i feel like im fighting the two of them all the time. this makes me cranky, and even more irritated then i already am with them. one of the pisces friend has to make a comment on everything i do..for example...from what im wearing, and how she was going to buy the pretty pink sandles i was wearing the other day...and just yesterday, we were attending our history class and i jotted down the date of when some organization was formed and she made this disbelieving face and said to me... "you dont even know when it was formed?" i was so annoyed at her for this and i so wanted to say something equally rude but instead i told her history wasnt my strong subject!  The other pisces friend is just as unbearable as the other.. she thinks she owns everything...oh and she thinks that all the guys in the world are looking at her... talking about her..and whenever we are going anywhere outside, she expecially points me out and says, we have all become the centre of attention.. and we should all behave like mature adults...and lower our voices. since i dont believe that women should change their attitude for the sake of men...i dont really do the pretentious lady like behavior...i like who i am and i totally stay the same! i like to be independant, and just so you know pisces friend no# 2 is double timing her boyfriend. it annoyes the hell out of me...i cant believe she tells me to act like a grown up when she needs the growing up part!....i have a strong belief of acting out who you are while she believes in decieveing people with her innocent looking act. i sometimes wonder if this is ever going to end? what should i do with firends like these? and why are they being so difficult?

20090226080609AA3I95r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my fiance really want to be with me or am I just a rebound?	My fiance and I have been together for about a year. I have a 3 year old and he has a four year old. I watch his daughter when we have her while he's at work which is not a problem. My issue, however, is that her mother is telling her to treat me and my daughter badly, she has beat on my daughter and kicked me in the stomach knowing that I had just had a procedure for cervical cancer. She has told me, her father and her grandma that she's told to act this way with me and as much as I ask, he never confronts his ex. He says he just doesn't talk to her, which is not true. He also decided to marry me after an argument with his ex in which she told him I don't matter because he'll never marry me. Recently, he told me he wanted to celebrate Valentine's Day and told me all the wonderful things he had done for her on past Valentine's, after I told him I really don't like that holiday because my ex always forgot, but I agreed and got him a gift. My fiance forgot and when I brought it up to him he said, I'm sorry, ok? and that he had a surprise in mind though to make it up. He just confessed to me that he did have a surprise but might as well not even bother now.  We have had issues with him lying about stupid little things and snapping on me also, but he says he's trying to stop.

20090226081229AAnGwNs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Education and Future. What do YOU think?	Hi, I am a 30 yr old italian girl who is dating a 35yr old American man for 6 years now. He is The One! Unfortunately the relationship seems not able to take off.He is not ready for "that" blind jump (marriage), he is not 100% sure I am the One for him I guess.I am in love -this is why I am so devoted, still waiting and hoping. BUT since new year arrived we've been talking big time about serious things like marriage&future together (finally).I have a high school diploma of foreign languages and I have been working for 8 years in an American environment- using my language skills and knowledge. I started almost right after high school-always wanted to get my own indipendence, earn and save some money for the future. Always loved my job - responsibilities and good pay is what I like the most. "The idea of a college degree " has been in my mind for the past two years. Study and Work (full time) is very very hard but I wanted to give it a try because I want more from myself and I don't want for my brain to go to sleep too soon.So I am at school now.Of course I just started college and it officially takes 3 years if not longer. I don't mind I have no rush but I do somehow. He has a bachelor degree and a good job. He is very ambitious and very much big money-oriented. He always says "I want the best around - also the best wife.want you to get a master degree.education is fundamental" I agree w/that.Education is very important nowadays - but...It seems more like ANOTHER reason that keeps us separated-to take time.The other day I asked him "I have a job and have my own life here and you have your own things there - we both are working and earning money-do you think we will ever have the chance to "enjoy" each other one day?" and he said: " yes when you finish school". OK now I understand Education is very important but after 6 years you cannot tell me to wait longer bc I don't have a bachelor or master degree. It might take even longer than 3ys because I do work full time Monday through Friday and besides that I also give space to the other things that I enjoy doing in my spare time such as: tutoring, food class, astronomy class, work out, dance classes, hang out..so honestly I am not 100% focused on getting my degree "tomorrow"!I study for the exams but I do not rush it..and I am honest HE knows that.Moreover if we are now talking about a future and the possibility to go live in the States, I would rather work hard to get a degree there once we'll be settled/married. My Italian degree would not even be valid in States-I still would have to start over from zero. Wouldn't it make more sense? Am I being stupid and childish? If you love someone don't you love the person she/he is? I am quite confused.

20090226081333AAeYUGN	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How much power do your guardians have?	So a friend of mine had some abusive parents and basically to make a long story short she moved into a middle aged couples house. She has been living there for a little bit over a year but what seemed good at 1st is no longer good. The woman of the house pretty much believes that now she is her mom and that she has to do and abide by all her rules ( They even try to make her call them "mom" and "dad"). The girl is 17 years old and was never actually adopted. They are only her guardians. Because she feels uncomfortable living in that house now. Can she legally move out with a friend who is 18? Or could her guardians prevent that from happening?
