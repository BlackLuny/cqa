Other than that, it's beautiful and you are very skilled with the rhyming scheme. I guess the only critique is that you don't keep a consistent syllable count. Each stanza has a different syllable count, but you probably meant to write it that way.(?)

Era una bella princesa que estaba buscando consorte...     Entre los candidatos se encontraba un joven plebeyo, que no tena ms riquezas que amor y perseverancia.     Cuando le lleg el momento de hablar, dijo:     Princesa, te he amado toda mi vida. Como soy un hombre pobre y no tengo tesoros para darte, te ofrezco mi sacrificio como prueba de amor. Estar cien das sentado bajo tu ventana, sin ms alimentos que la lluvia y sin ms ropas que las que llevo puestas. sa es mi dote.     La princesa, conmovida por semejante gesto de amor, decidi aceptar.     Tendrs tu oportunidad, si pasas la prueba, me desposars.     As pasaron las horas y los das. El pretendiente estuvo sentado, soportando los vientos, la nieve y las noches heladas.    Sin pesta?ear, con la vista fija en el balcn de su amada, el valiente vasallo sigui firme en su empe?o, sin desfallecer un momento.    De vez en cuando la cortina de la ventana real dejaba traslucir la esbelta figura de la princesa, la cual, con un noble gesto y una sonrisa, aprobaba la faena.     Todo iba a las mil maravillas. Incluso algunos optimistas haban comenzado a planear los festejos. Al llegar el da noventa y nueve, los pobladores de la zona haban salido a animar al prximo monarca.    Todo era alegra y jolgorio, hasta que de pronto, cuando faltaba una hora para cumplirse el plazo, ante la mirada atnita de los asistentes y la perplejidad de la infanta, el joven se levant y sin dar explicacin alguna, se alej lentamente del lugar.     Unas semanas despus, mientras deambulaba por un solitario camino, un ni?o de la comarca lo alcanz y le pregunt a quemarropa ?Qu fue lo que te ocurri? Estabas a un paso de lograr la meta ?Por qu perdiste esa oportunidad? ?Por qu te retiraste?     Con profunda consternacin y algunas lgrimas que corran en su rostro, contest en voz baja: "Ella NO me ahorr ni un da de sufrimiento, ni siquiera una hora, no merece mi amor"...      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPkZ31auW...|`|3c264e2bd111e83213e20df36cd2db04aa	creo que deberias dejar de insistirle o alejarte un poco de ella porque si sigues estando tan cerca suya te vas a seguir enamorando aun mas y mas porque la tienes cerca y eso.    si te alejas se te pasara y no perderas su amistad|`|howtbp49aa	Jaime, yo te dira, que fueras sincero con ella.

zEHU0E9Yaa	Perhaps not coincidentally, the behaviorist perspective for this mirrors the yogic perspective. In yoga, there are exercises that isolate and stimulate particular areas of the body in order to relax them, as it is easier to relax from a state of tension than it is from a state of neutrality.    Likewise, the easiest way to relax from the behaviorist psychology perspective is to use imagery to excite or agitate first, then adopt a relaxing technique.|`|2662bff905d732c360e759fb500fa522aa	Never heard of YOGA, Breathing techniques, and there are some exercises, sports and some stretching exercises.|`|8qqpB7Vsaa	beer    massage    TV watching|`|AA10314243	diaphragmatic breathing (see also vipassana meditation)  systematic muscle relaxation  mindfulness exercises  guided imagery  hypnosis

ZYp1AEspaa	It's a catch phrase from the 1970's or thereabouts. It appeared on everything from tea towels to movie scripts.<br>  <br>  It's sort of ambiguous, isn't it? Does it mean you should never have to apologize to your loved one, even if you've done something wrong? <br>  Or that you will never do anything to cause a need for apology, owing to love? <br>  Probably the nicest way to look at it is that it means the other person understands you so well you don't really have to apologize (though you should anyway, so they can say "no need:)|`|mY4m47WTaa	Ideally, it means that you will never hurt the one you love. Better, though, is that the person that you wronged has already forgiven you before you ask for forgiveness.|`|NhMfGXmxaa	It doesn't mean anything. It's a made up line for a Hollywood movie that sounds profound yet means nothing at all. It's a nonsensical phrase used for Hollywood effect.|`|2eWVaB9Waa	It means nothing. It's a stupid line.<br>  <br>  So I can kill my wife and never say sorry to her family because I 'loved' her?|`|YQOT68xFaa	It's a load of crap, quite frankly. When you love someone you don't suddenly become flawless. You will eventually hurt or upset them, and you should apologize when you do. If you don't, your relationship won't be so great because they will wonder why you're such a jerk. <br>  <br>  Love means that you always say you're sorry!|`|NYU37jfGaa	I think it's supposed to mean that if you love someone, you don't need to tel them you're sorry, because they know.  I think it's simply idiotic.

DwumkLMPaa	 un deja-vu,capita anche a me.  Dicono che  normale!"|`|Z2uQ6pklaa	Il nome del fenomeno  "deja vu" (anche paramnesia). Si dice che il deja vu faccia ritornare alla mente momenti di una vita gi passata. grazie a esso si riesce a scoprire, anche se credo ben poco, la nostra vita passata.  Il dj vu  associato con precognizione, chiaroveggenza o percezioni extra-sensoriali, ed  frequentemente citato come un'evidenza delle abilit "psichiche" della popolazione generale. Spiegazioni non-scientifiche attribuiscono questa esperienza a profezia, visioni (ad esempio ricevute in sogni) o memorie di vite passate.  Per quanto riguarda i sogni... Alcuni credono che il dj vu sia il ricordo dei sogni. L'ipotesi  che, seppure vengano solitamente dimenticati prima del risveglio, i sogni possano lasciare qualche traccia non comune all'esperienza presente nella memoria a lungo termine. In questo caso, il dj vu potrebbe essere il ricordo di un sogno dimenticato con elementi in comune all'esperienza presente.  vabb t'ho spiegato un p... sai...  stato un mio argomento d'esame... ci sentiamo...

There is an odd preference for evidence that comes from Africa and similar evidence from Asia is often discounted.  It seems to me that clearly there were potential human ancestors in Asia for at least a million years based on tools and to a lesser degree fossils.  Even when the fossils of the little humans were found in Indonesia, they had to pay homage to the out of Africa crowd.  They tend to get upset at any evidence which jeaopardizes or diminishes it and Moorewood and Brown didn't want to have the controversy.  Chimps, our closest relatives, live in Africa.  Darwin predicted our fossils should be there.  It turns out our ancestors may have been relatively mobile.  There are some that seem to look at Africa as a one way gate with our ancestors only leaving and with the genes never flowing back.

mJx42D2Iaa	Wow, its very interesting that a 5 year old would have a dream like that. There are a lot of things this dream could mean. First of all, I just want to ask.. Did you watch a movie about war around that time? I just want to clear that up because you were so young and it's very easy for a young mind to get wrapped up with such scenes. If you had watched some sort of movie about war (especially if it took place in the past) your dream could have been mimicking what you saw. The fact that you were looking for your mother is the 5-year-old side of you, confused by what you saw happening. The siren could have been from the film itself, or maybe even as a child you knew sirens meant trouble (whether it be a fire, smoke, police, etc) so you associated it with the war trouble. That's one explanation.    However, if you hadn't seen that kind of movie any time around there, then there must be some other sort of explanation. The cobblestone streets could mean that this was something that happened in the the past (whether it was in YOUR past, or in a past life). The fact that you were looking for your mother could mean a lot of things. I think your age really is a factor in that aspect though. Any child in such a situation would be looking for their mother, for safety and comfort. The fact that you were older in the dream is the most confusing part. Maybe you just wanted to be older in order to deal with the situation?  Maybe you were worried about your future, even as a child. As for the siren, I still think it had to do with the influence of other sirens to you. As a child, you are warned about sirens. Everyone tells you if you hear one, be careful and pay attention. As for the aspect that it was a war, maybe you were scared of something happening? I just don't know how a five year old could know about war..     That is a very complex dream, especially because you were so young. Honestly, I just don't see how a child that young could dream about something like that, unless you had seen it on TV. If that wasn't the case, then I really do think that could be a memory from a past life, if you believe in that. It's very interesting!    Sirens: Initially designed to warn of air raids in World War II, they were adapted to warn of nuclear attack and of natural phenomena such as tornadoes. The generalized nature of the siren led to many of them being replaced with more specialized warnings, such as the Emergency Alert System. During the cold war virtually every city had a siren warning system to warn citizens of a coming nuclear attack. Today, cities that are regularly threatened with natural disasters (tornados, floods etc.) are still using outdoor siren systems.|`|uJ9waJDYaa	Sirens in war time were often used as air raid warnings, like that jets or something alike were coming and warning people to take cover as bombs may be dropped. Generally they were just warnings that attack was about to strike and to take cover.  This does seem like a very peculiar dream for a young child to have, so you may well be experiencing some kind of dream from a past life, or maybe even from a family member. Do you know of anyone in your family from that long ago, who may have lost their mother, to death or because of war?  It could have even be triggered from a story you might have heard, maybe someone told you a story from when they were at war or something and then you stared having dreams similar to the story you had heard when you were even younger.    I think that's really interesting tho, it might be worth it if u ever get a chance see a, im not sure what they would be called, but i do know there are people who sort of specialize in different dreams, specificly dreams from young ages or re-orrucing ones.|`|W2kKBXmvaa	Very interseting dream. I have freaky dreams. Once I had a dream that my fish died. He really did die two weeks later after the dream. Some people have visions about their past lives. You're probably one of those people. I think sirens were used in World War 2 to signal that the Germans were coming.

c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	Does this sound like the study you're thinking of?:    Several studies have found body and facial symmetry as well as attractiveness to be human mate choice criteria. These characteristics are presumed to signal developmental stability. Human body odour has been shown to influence female mate choice depending on the immune system, but the question of whether smell could signal general mate quality, as do other cues, was not addressed in previous studies. We compared ratings of body odour, attractiveness, and measurements of facial and body asymmetry of 16 male and 19 female subjects. Subjects wore a T-shirt for three consecutive nights under controlled conditions. Opposite-sex raters judged the odour of the T-shirts and another group evaluated portraits of the subjects for attractiveness. We measured seven bilateral traits of the subject's body to assess body asymmetry. Facial asymmetry was examined by distance measurements of portrait photographs. The results showed a significant positive correlation between facial attractiveness and sexiness of body odour for female subjects. We found positive relations between body odour and attractiveness and negative ones between smell and body asymmetry for males only if female odour raters were in the most fertile phase of their menstrual cycle. The outcomes are discussed in the light of different male and female reproductive strategies.|`|AA11658197	never heard of that but interesting none the less|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	look for it on google or any other popular search engine.
ToILKl6waa	Probably freshman year in high school - english class. When everyone was reading their stories relaxed and confident, I got up there and had a panic attack while reading it. My voice trembled and the entire class was oblivious to the situation, but the immature teens that they were, laughed at the whole thing and made me feel humiliated.|`|ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.

gwqS6xHpaa	Plenty of blame to go around... Not in any order either.      1 - American People: we borrowed too much credit, lived well beyond our means, had no cash savings and signed up for many things we didn't understand. We trusted the banks, car dealers/manufacturers and sales people too much. We lost our human touch.  No house, car or television is going to substantially change your life for the better over the a regular house, car or television.  So we bought our way into this problem. Especially with housing. Tens of millions of Americans fell into the housing trap ignorantly.    2 Education system:  Sadly, we do not have a personal finance curriculum in our modern education system.  Sure, some people can go to college and study personal finance, psychology or business. But, these people represent a small majority of Americans. We need to have personal finance classes in high school.  It needs to be mandatory to graduate from high school or pass 11th or 12th grade.  It is ridiculous that we hand out GED's, diplomas, 2 year, 4 year, master and doctorate degrees to people who cannot even figure out how much of their car loan payment goes to interest.  Even more ridiculous that so many people have no idea what the principal amount of a loan. I know we overload our students with so many standards and classes. I seriously think we should eliminate a math class in high school with personal finance.  Or, incorporate it. I know geometry is great. I loved it.  But, personal finance is more important for 99% of the population than learning ASA and AAS theorem.    3 - Banking System: HOW COULD THESE BAFFOONS SCREW UP SO BAD!!!  Greed. Greed. Greed.  They tricked so many people with small print, fake or slanted scenarios for interest rates on adjustable and interest only loans. I am glad some of them have fallen and 50,000 "Wall Streeters" have lost their jobs.  Wall Street was WAY TO POWERFUL.    4 - The Bush Administration: I am not going to say it is all or mostly GW's fault.  But, he was the leader of our nation.  And, though he may not have been at fault through his actions or the actions of his government, he must bare responsibility for his inactions during the run up.  The President of the USA is still the strongest person in the world with more influence than anyone else.  Where was the President and/or his men and women warning the average consumer about the problems of adjustable rate mortgages, lowered interest rates that hyperinflated the value of houses and created a bubble.  Further, where were they when the bubble crashed 12-18 months ago.  And, what about when he tried to convince us to spend our way out of the recession in the beginning of his tenure.  That was highly irresponsible behavior from the man with access to TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS and more contemporary influence than any other person in history.       THERE IS PLENTY OF BLAME TO GO AROUND.  Maybe, when people come out and say they things that are not popular or sound hard or "anti-American", instead of labeling them as unpatriotic and traitors and crazy liberals, we should actually listen to what they have to say. We do not have to believe them. We do not have follow them.  But, at least listen.  Hundreds of experts, professors, non-profit agencies and regular joes came out saying the US economy was at risk of caving in over 5 years ago.  There were books, reports, meetings, tv intereviews.  But, as a society (people, business and government under GW) we didn't want to hear it.|`|f36331383ab8dad2a7a7cbba8c28e980aa	Overextension of Credit, lack of fiscal oversight, and responsibility, risky loans, high oil prices, corporate scandals, high business taxes, unequal income taxes, etc.    Those are the major issues of the slump really.|`|UI2R4zPPaa	Our economy is in such a horrible state for a number of reasons.  The housing market is collapsing because people spent more than they could afford and the banks lent to anyone!  The businesses that are going out of business is because PEOPLE ARE NOT SPENDING MONEY, because they spent more than they could afford, and those that do still have money banks included are hoarding it in fear of what the economy will do.  Even though gas prices are down you can expect them to climb higher than ever this summer, the answer is all GREED.
gmaCvh00aa	Kick yourself in the ***.    Figuratively, of course.  But you need to go force yourself to do the very things you don't feel like doing.  MAKE yourself go for a walk--see if there is a nature center or something nearby.  Walking (or running) raises the seratonin levels in your brain, so you will feel better afterward.    I know it's hard to get to that point, but it helps me to break activity down into small bits, as small as you need to.  For example, first you may need to go find your shoes.  Then put them on.  Then get your keys...but just think of them as one activity each at a time.  Too much can be overwhelming, and yes, even if it's only going for a walk.      Also, I recommend finding something that's yours for your pleasure in the creative area.  Write, paint, write music, play an instrument....we all need that, and it gets the crap out.|`|MQ6miq8Caa	tey to do every thing that u can and don't give up!|`|B52KNW7Haa	I am a Christian I find so much comfort and strength in Jesus.

You can do things, or not do things, while you are bored that can lead to your death, but though a dopamine imbalance within the brain can slow metabolism (depression and boredom are very similar in nature, chemical-wise), it doesn't stop it.    Even people who die 'in their sleep' die from either a brain aneuryism (a failure of a blood vessel in the brain) or a heart attack, neither of which is caused by a lack of movement or the above.    Even people who 'die' of depression are probably, unconsciously, chemically stimulating their heart (over a period of time) in an attempt to induce a heart attack. Again, that is an active, not a passive process (even if it is subconscious.)|`|DPwI1Cspaa	i doubt it|`|9yvP51yyaa	nope|`|Wy4VKreKaa	I almost did from reading your question|`|MTUaomEKaa	If youre bored enough to go completely "insane" and kill urself.

However, you seem to have overly reacted to her constructive criticism.  You decided to project an opposite persona to the world.    Just realize that you only need to make minor adjustments to your personality projection to be perceived differently.    You just over corrected for your perceived problem.  Back off from that position and seek a compromising position which is closer to the norm, rather than skewed to the extreme.

BI8c6XXPaa	Awww, I am so sorry! You have every right to be embarassed. And hello, you were dripping wet and cold, if those people would have any sense, they know it makes you smaller. My guess is those people would not know your face if you came up to them, they were too busy focusing on *ahem* something else.     I think you will look back on this. It is your choice to laugh about it, or to cringe. I am sorry about the guy you live with mocking you about it. Maybe find a new roommate if you can, unless he apologizes to you. College is rough, and I am really sorry about this. He should have led the people outside and thrown you a towel.     I am so sorry this happened to you. College is rough because you are discovering who you are and now you probably feel inadequate because of this. Don't let what they think change you. You are probably a very awesome person. Act like it never happened, even if people snicker about it, hold your head up high. It will be hard. Your roommate will probably think you're really tough if you just shrug it off, like whatever dude, I don't care what people think.    Best of luck. Get out of your room, go see some friends, or make some. Go for a walk. You will be fine, this too shall pass.|`|WRbbpRZzaa	Brush your shoulders off, lad.|`|pVTevFJgaa	When did this happen?  You have to forget it... They won't put that in the newspaper, don't be scared... and they will probably laugh and annoy you about it for a while, but they'll forget it anyways...    I peed in front of my class once... It was shameful, but I am still alive, as you can see! And the size of your d!ck doesn't matter. If they care about the d!ck more than about yourself, then they're probably not worth it anyways...    Hope it makes you feel better :-)    P.S.: And do not forget to bring your towel and clothes next time!|`|Qqg5ALE2aa	Whyever not?    You have the advantage.  There is no more.  That's it.

I've had lots of embarrassing things happen to me and the best thing to do is just let the time pass and go on with life.  One time I had just eaten lunch and worked out with about 30 other people and after I had gotten out I threw up in front of the girls' locker room and had gallons of gross stuff come out of my mouth.. Man it was very embarrassing and I never wanted to come back again. But, I did and eventually people forget about it and later on maybe u will laugh about it.  Everyone has these moments, so no need to worry. I'm sure everything will go along just fine!.. Hope you feel better bro.. Time will handle this.|`|1Ri3zxqWaa	You should face it now because believe me the longer you stay locked in your room the harder it will be to face them. i should know, i once had a leak without knowing it and walked around school like that all day. Anyways, about them laughing at you, they probably didn't know how to just ignore the fact that you walked out naked so they laughed and made fun of you.keep your chin high. Were all different. And if things don't get better i think you can decide on your own whats best .|`|TsCMDYEkaa	no one sees it as such a big deal as you right now...and we understand your feelings ..truthfully we all at one point or another in our lives had had embarrassing moments but what it IS IMPORTANT ...is your reaction to it...just compose yourself and join in as if it is a joke...for if you don't take it to heart and laugh with them they will leave u alone and forget about it as there is no more energy to feed on..but if u hide in horror they will think there IS something wrong with you ...when in fact there isn't. cold shrinkage and panic what u expect..don't worry and carry on normally|`|EkUiuiABaa	They area  group of blokes being blokes and trying to be funny...they prob felt a bit embarrased too so whats the best way to break the ice?...make a joke!!

Oh and I'll pray for you. Better Yet I'll have my Church Pray for you, because those Demon Dreams are just...Ugggghhh.|`|ANe1LAkYaa	Dreams about teeth falling out are often a sign of insecurity. Teeth represent your appearance to the world, because they are something that you and everyone you encounter see every day. All of your dreams seem to be rooted in social anxiety.    In interpreting your dreams, I would avoid making religious and spiritual connections, as dreams are a very psychological and scientific process. When you dream, your brain is firing off random signals at various parts of your brain that were accessed since you last dreamt. (People dream every night whether they remember or not). You experience these random signals as a story or situation because your brain assembles them that way to make sense of its own random-fire.    So, if you have been experiencing anxiety lately, your brain is "saving the files" of your anxiety, by firing at those specific parts of your brain during dream-sleep. I would try meditating once or twice a day, or just taking a moment to relax, and your nightmares should be gone in no time. On a random note, you should also avoid eating before bed (especially foods with strong, sweet, or spicy flavors).    Hope that helped!

For instance, even if someone really was psychic if their family was ultra-conservative and hated that stuff then the person would probably close thier mind to the supernatural. But even in environments where children are encouraged to show psychic ability (i.e. the home of a palm reader) not all kids exhibit any talent at all.    Hope that helps! good luck!

It depends on the (killer's) personality and the situation (unless you are the killee, then I say it would SUCK BIGTIME---but then you probably would have asked how does it feel to BE killed by someone..whatever). Anyway, I hope to not have to find out, however I believe I'm inclined to kill over being killed, as in self-defense or justifiable cause, and deal with the feelings after. Can't we all just get along?...obviously not.

If you want to live vicariously through someone else's experience, I would say it's impossible.  Your curiosity, where does it really come from?  Do you want to know if there's remorse? Empowerment? A thrill?  I would suggest you search your soul to find the real answer that can apply to you if you truly want to know.

zd8eoMcKaa	As long as I can remember (I still do this!), when I'm doing something I absent-minded start "writing" or doodling on air with my hand. I played with my dolls by making whole stories :P  an entire soap opera, you could say... And I would come up with weird names for people, I knew this guy with short curly brown hair and I called him "Meatball head" :/ I also used to have for some time this weird fantasy that if, when laying the clothes to dry, I used pins of the same color on each piece of clothing, something magical and strange would happen and one of my dreams come true.

K4wHY0mjaa	When you have a closed mind, you live in the ideas, opinions and attitudes that you have already created in your mind. You don't know if they are true. Because you make those opinons, attitudes and ideas with whatever feelings and information that you get with your five senses. Your senses can cheat you. No one knows what is the actual truth.    You run to enter a room and see that the door is half closed. So you decide that the society rejcts you. Otherwise why have they closed the door half way? That is your attitude. The reality was that when they saw that you are running towards they opened the closed door half way.    That is an over simplification of a physical reality. You would have seen a famous picture which can be interpreted as a 75 year old woman or a 17 year old dame. I can send you that separately if you so desire.    So the senses can cheat you. A soft touch may be a killing touch. Poison can be sweet.    When you have closed your mind then you live in these opinons and attitudes which you have already formed. There could be contradictory facts. Unless you keep your mind open, your doors and windows open (as Aldous Huxly puts it) you would live there only. Imagine you are closed in a room with all the windows and doors closed. You don't know th nights and days passing by. One day you decided to open one window. Imagine that bright sun light which comes shining into your room.    Similarly, you could get another paradigm. You could get another angle. You could get another view point.    So keep your mind open to new ideas.|`|ykHygYNraa	ppl who are closed minded are very difficult to talk to. i avoid them or just dont say much around them. u can be open to new ideas w/o agreeing with them. just accept that person's point of view.|`|oIlRk3Xuaa	Why do you think it is?

MfOMIXzBaa	your people are becoming over educated with out enough intellectually stimulated work.  no one is fulfilled doing physical labor.|`|AA10632598	The hard working labour force is migrating to Ratnagiri of Maharashtra and Goa as the remunerations are high there. The useless are remaining in their home villages/hometowns prompting you to opine like this. Goans and people of Ratnagiri feel that it is below their dignity to do physical work. Keralites,  Tamilians and people of North Karnataka generally migrate to Maharashtra and Goa in summer and return home during cropping seasons. As the cream is migrated you feel the scarcity of good work force. In Andhra, people are hardworking and are paid adequately and hence there are no migrations.

But yes, it is possible.
HWjuusdgaa	the theory of remembering things is very complicated.  but what everybody can say, is when something special happens, or something that affects you allot, you will remember it.  don't you remember a moment of your 5-year old live?    the prob that you have is, you want to learn the guitar riffs by ear..  maybe your not really into it, maybe you force yourself to much, you have to do it you have to do it. no that's not the way of playing an instrument  playing a instrument, you have to enjoy it, it's a way of expressing your emotions and everything you have in your head.  with every singing guitar riff, don't you have a flashback, or another emotional moment?  maybe by expressing your feelings while your playing, you can remember them better.  =)|`|fuUbsMg9aa	Repetition is the only way to learn and remeber- like 100 times will last for a while  200 time -longer and so on|`|qZPL6PSVaa	it varies from person to person|`|Gvvn84q6aa	The best method for memory and recall is a technique called brief frequent review.    Just review things once every few days and it will stay fresh. After a while it will become more and more solid. So if you learn something one day, make sure you at least play through it a few times over the week. And then after that just a few times, and eventually you will have them pretty well stored.    The next technique is a bit different. The more associations a thought has the more likely you are to recall it. So if you learn a particular part of a song, you can recall it by playing the part that leads up to it. It's like when you know a song by heart. You cannot tell me what the third verse is, but when you sing it in order, line by line, you can then tell me.    So you make a song or piece or whatever that includes a set of things you want to remember. Then when you go to review them, you are less likely to forget it since you have that associate helping to pry it out. The more associations you give it (ie the more songs you put it in) the less likely you are to forget it.|`|3f472ffb578b5c756958c260f98d3282aa	Juts keep on repeating it over and over again.

6abd3bdb56caa5b55d37adf04ec88a38aa	Well, as the old saying goes sometimes it has to get worse before it gets better. Linen's and Things closed down, Now Circuit City is closing it's doors. Hey, I also heard that Michigan has the most obese ppl as well as the highest unemployement in the Nation per/Royal Oak friend. Dang! things are bad all over maybe the film industry will pick up detroit since the automotive is going to the crapper. My Dad retired from Livonia Plant GM  spring and bumper div. back in 88' my mom worked for Chrysler and she was laid off for 7 yrs before they called her back from the Dodge Main plant in Hamtramak to Sterling Hghts. plant. she quit when my dad retired. Moved to TN. My friends are still there. Royal Oak- Pharmaceutical Rep, Farmington Hills- traveling surgical tech for oral surgeon, Teachers Aide in East Lansing they all seem to be doing ok. I haven't spoke to my friend out in Utica whose a car designer for GM so, not sure how his job's doing or his brother who is part owner with their dad in a Painting business for commercial/residential contracts. Funny, how the housing market is yet they keep putting up new subdivisions up left and right where I'm at. Some folks are so damn picky about jobs but, they forget how bad things are. be happy you have a job and bringing in some sort of income even if it's minimum wage. Times are tough for everybody and it's nationwide. The richer get richer, the poorer get poorer, and the middle class get screwed over and over we don't get any breaks yet we're the main working class as well as the one footing most of the bills. I'm lucky enough that my husband has been working for the same place for 13 yrs. and things look good there. I'm a domestic engineer so, even if I did work all my paycheck would go towards daycare and gas in my car. So, I'm grateful that he can provide for his family and I can stay at home to care for our son.|`|5Snex2peaa	Not soon.

Will things get better?  Eventually yes; after this economy gets worse.  Regardless of what I say people are going to believe what the want but the truth is that we are living in the last days.  For those of you that believe in Jesus Christ the son of the Living God will know that there is a 2nd coming of Christ and I believe it is near. When? Noboody knows but its near.  In the book of revelations and daniel there are a number of events that are to take place in the real world right before the 2nd coming.  Some of the events are happening now and others will occur later on.  Right now the unemployment rate in the US is around 7.2% and even higher then that in some states.  By 2009 end we will most likely be looking at double digits in unemployment. As the economy continues to fall,  crimes such as drugs, violence, robbery, theft, kidnapping and rape will soar to very high levels everywhere.  This is also in the bible.  People in the world will call themselves the messiah or Christ, rumors of wars(World World 3 possibly) men will betray men, men will kill men.   All of these are signs of the times according to the bible and this is God's prophecy and things will go according to Gods plan no matter how hard a president works to change things.  You cant change Gods plans.   But overall, it does get better;  when Jesus comes back.      As far as Obama,  there are things going around about him being the antichrist.  Now I am in no way calling him an antichrist,  its too early to tell anyway.  But rather he is or isnt,  his true colors will be shown in due time.  There are also rumors about him being the messiah.  Oprah worships him like is some kind of god.  Folks Obama is not the messiah and he alone cannot save this country or the economy for that matter.  There have been billions of dollars in bailouts and I bet more bailouts will come about along with this big billion dollar stimulus.  You cant just throw money at ecnomic issues and expect the problem to be solved.  Some states are running out of unemployment funds and the gov't will be supplying the money for that.  It wont be long before the Fed gov't callapse as well.  As I said before things will get worse and remain there until Jesus comes and for those of you that put all of your faith into president Obama,  you will soon be disappointed.      Put your faith into the one who is the creator of the heaven and earth.  I dont know what each individuals situation is but if you want out of a bad situation then look to the Lord your God and pray your way out.|`|OI7eeIreaa	NO.

Leave.  In general though the economy should be back to normal by the summer or 2010. It al depends on when the financial system is 'fixed'. During the Bush term, it grew expodentially, effectively creating a black, or unregulated, banking system that was international. Now that that has collapsed, banks are no longer lending money. Which means that adverage joes can't get loans to make major purchases. This causes companies to fire ppl like poor joe, which causes ppl not to buy minor things. Its a cycle, a cycle that requires new international regulations. Their is talk of setting up a new Bretton Woods like structure, which I support. You should call your congressman/woman to make sure they get that done.

296b3ddd20aa6b7c48fb40d2c187aedfaa	Capitalism is deception about ownership of companies.    There are all new companies, stores, restaurants, and banks every 4 years and an average employment duration of 1 year within false economics capitalism, (that is possibly a secret homelessness-without-health insurance death camp). Remaining solvent does not actually exist within false economics capitalism.    Get rich quick schemes in the capitalist business world, (buyouts, IPOs, conglomerates, acquisitions, mergers, and the stock market), do not actually work. Profit existing in the capitalist business world, or millionaires existing within capitalism, is pathological deception committed by the 21 organizations spying on the population with plain clothes agents, (with covert fake names and fake backgrounds).    Actual economics is the persons that are paying the business loans of companies voting at work in order to control the property they are paying for. The employees of companies are also paying the expenses of companies beyond the salary of the employees.

AA10911602	I'll ask you some questions.  When interest rates go up, what happens to savings? Yes, they increase.  When interest rates go up, what happens to borrowing? As yououild imagine, they decrease.  What then is the net effect on the level of demand within the economy? Net demand falls and the economy contracts. Money supply decreases.  Do you think that If I had $1m to invest in bonds, I would invest it here where the rate has remained static at 10% or there whare the interest rate has increased to 11%? Yes, I invest there. The money supply increases.  Think about these questions and get the answer to your own question.|`|q2SzkuaXaa	You've got this the wrong way round.

The gist of it is that a loaf of bread in Zimbabwe costs US$0.80, if you have US dollars. Otherwise, it costs about 70 Trillion Zimbabwe dollars. That's right - Z$70,000,000,000,000. On average, prices in Zimbabwe dollars double every 24.7 hours.  Mugabe and Company have been able to maintain control over the military by printing vast quantities of banknotes that become worthless very quickly. Now, even the military is demanding to be paid in US dollars or South Africa rands, because no merchant wants to be paid in Zim dollars. A military revolt would be the end of Mugabe, but a military dominated government won't be much better.  http://allafrica.com/stories/20090126084...  http://allafrica.com/stories/20090123068...  http://allafrica.com/stories/20090129080...|`|ncSd9jXDaa	its very, very sad... =(    they were on an amazing track, they were the fastest growing country in AFrica and surpassed South Africa....    unfortunately they got a COMMUNIST PRESIDENT    and took farmland away from the rich people and gave it to the poor people.            kinda sounds familiar, doesnt it?|`|GR8jsGgLaa	That inflation percentage is how fast the currency becomes worthless in 1/year.

Maybe your mother was a housewife but men and women are both breadwinners now in a modern family.   It's only fair for a working couple to share housework. Whoever does ironing depends on whoever is better at it or more keen on it. Looks like your other half doesn't enjoy the job. In that case you should do it yourself, since you can't force people to do the things they dislike and at the end of the day, the shirt is yours.  My husband never asks me to iron his shirt. He always gets the iron ready and prepares to do it himself but I always grab the iron and do it for him because I like ironing and believe I do a better job than him.

Boredom could have led our ancestors to inventing tools which they could have used for hunting and whatnot. Boredom could have attributed to the foundation of technology. I personally find myself making little "doo-dads" and "whatchamacallits" with parts laying around my house when I'm bored. Boredom just gets people doing things. Those things could be productive (like making the wheel or the first hunting tool), or things that aren't (like punching yourself in the stomach to pass time).|`|l0FPw0LVaa	it gets you doing stuff

AA10781962	In your dream, the man represented Death. In your real life, you did something while your grandpa was alive that prevented him from dying earlier; however, Death was going to inevitably return, and you wouldn't be around when it did.<br>  <br>  Finding your grandpa's house on fire means that you weren't around when he died. Your running into the burning house to save him is the desire to still see him alive.<br>  <br>  You can still see him alive in your mind.<br>  <br>  When a person dies, they don't die nor cease to exist. The body is only temporary, but the soul is forever.<br>  <br>  Your grandpa simply passed through this life as others who have done so before him, and where you will also do after him.<br>  <br>  This life was a temporary stop, now his life is just beginning anew for him because he is now as the celestial angels - eternal.<br>  <br>  So celebrate your grandpa's life and remember the joy he was to your life.

You had no time to prepare for your Grandpa's departure. I think this man in your dream represents death and therefore he's a threat. The word that jumped out at me was "suddenly". Perhaps the flames represent the suddenness and speed of his death and the fact that you were not there with him at the end. Please try to come to terms with his passing. He's lived this life and by what you've said about being so close to him, he's taught you lots of good things. I'm sure there's nothing you could have done better. I'm also sure that your Grandpa's soul is still with you and would not want you to suffer unnecessary guilt. I lost my mum when I was 20 and I still miss her, but everyday I look at her photo and I thank her for having been there for me and I listen to her soul which is still so much a part of me.

KifasiMraa	You may have picked up on some body language or a sign from him in your waking life that your subconscious interpreted as meaning that he is interested in you, and was working it out while you were sleeping. This dream could also be reflecting your subconscious desire for him to like you and/or want to get to know you.  Some dream analysts also think that seeing another person in our dreams is really a manifestation of something in ourselves that that person represents to us. He may have exhibited a quality that you see in yourself and so you dreamed about him for that reason. Perhaps he symbolizes taking a chance on the unknown, the forbidden, or simple sexual desire. Since he was talking to you, a girl he doesn't really know, this may be your subconscious wishing it was brave enough to take similar risks.|`|djhCah5Maa	I have dreams about men that I have no interest in at all.

You need to understand why and how people's brains work the way they do and why a chemical imbalance can have a certain effect. You also need to understand how and why medications work for which you require biochemistry.<br>  <br>  As far as good universities go, it depends on where in Canada you are. Most universities in Canada offer an undergraduate program in psychology but you may find the courses are extremely over crowded and the classes are too big. You may want to choose a smaller school where you'll have more hands-on experience, a better chance of lab experience and teachers who aren't teaching more students than they can handle.

AA11642531	We were invited to the inauguration and inaugural ball for a state governor.We received a beautiful, engraved invitation with a reply card and envelope. Since the governor elect was a friend, I somehow failed to see the additional response card that called for a $500/person donation. On the big day, my husband decked out in his tuxedo and I in a new gown appeared at the ball. Of course, our name was not on the guest list but the hostess at the door contacted the guest of honor who came and welcomed us. We did not have $1000 that we could donate and I have never been quite so embarrassed. We have been with the Governor several times since then and finally can laugh about the misunderstanding on my part.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	My Most Embarassing Moment Isnt Very Exciting Soooooo Bye|`|hnkMa69taa	once when i was in yesterday  i was in school  well technically  i was in science class  with a girl i liked  [hallelujah!!]    i know  embarrassing right?    haha justkidding  heres my real story:  i was trying to impress her   and so i acted out a scene from karate kid  ..she didnt like that very much..  she slapped me with a pencil  and it knocked me over!!  i dont know how  shes strong...  based on a true story|`|AA12255146	having my first period in a white dress in church. ew.
e4259abb4e5d0ea5a734423f5be756f9aa	It is real, the character of Cal Lightman is based on Paul Ekman.  I am sure there is some fictional license but for the most part the techniques are real.    The link below tells of Paul and his accomplishments (which are many).  He has written many books as well.      Check out his interviews from the link, I have read about him quite a bit, he is great.|`|83StA1rKaa	I was really disappointed in the show. But yes it is. A lot of what they say is true, but the problem is some times it is specific to a certain time, and certain ways. Also, the characters will sometimes have un-matching body language to how they are suppose to act, so trying to do it at home isn't going to work. If you like that stuff there is an excellent book. Body language by Julius Fast. I read his first book and he has a revised one out now and it is amazing.|`|Z8qBgv8taa	The show while I haven't seen it may not be "real" but the idea of it is very very real.     body language shows signs of deception, along with speech patterns and things out of our control when we show deception or lie.   simple examples, Guilty people get defensive, wont make eye contact or will place an object between you and themselves. Look up detecting lies through body language or something similar on google. Hope this helps|`|S8BCApc5aa	It is absolutely a real concept - though I'm not sure how accurate the show is as I haven't watched it yet, the idea of reading facial expressions and bodily reactions for specific cues that indicate a person's true intent is very well-documented. Humans communicate just as much, if not more, with non-verbal cues (including facial expressions and movements) as with actual words. It is generally subconscious learned behavior from experience, and therefore is very deeply ingrained in our communication skills. There are some very simple non-verbal cues that come up in counseling, for instance - crossing the arms across the chest is a huge one. The action of crossing one's arms across the chest is a way to erect a barrier between the listener and speaker. Basically, in a situation where one is having a good, friendly discussion, this means that the person crossing their arms is thinking about the topic being discussed in order to formulate a reply. In hostile situations, it is a general sign meant to convey that the other person does not wish to communicate further.    The big exception to all this are cases where a person has unusual communication patterns due to some sort of social disorder or psychological illness. Autism is a very good example of this. People with anxiety disorders often have trouble with making normal eye contact. If you're not aware of these possibilities, then it can lead to false conclusions. But generally, yes, these non-verbal cues are just another form of subtle communication that we all understand on a subconscious level - it's just hard to be observant enough to actively notice it at all times.    It's also a great thing to look into for poker players, trust me on that one. :)
elgVgRCRaa	All the time. We are just another animal in the world and while very advanced, not always to our benefit. We have the downfall of questioning ourselves and the world. A rat accepts that he is and lives as he is until he is no longer.     I look at it like this. You are what you are but that may not be human. To me the world is an illusion. A place where feelings and sights are not as they appear. If you dreamt that you are a butterfly are you a human dreaming that he is a butterfly or are you now a butterfly dreaming that he is human. Think outside yourself because everything you think you see is just electrical impulses in your brain.    We might be pointless creatures but do what you can to enjoy your time before you die. Unlike the rat you understand that you have so little time and so much to experience.|`|uXQcDsiAaa	of course not. humans are the smartest animals on the planet. We control everything. we enslave every other animal.(Zoo) we have , wonders, excitment, adventures, drama and emotions.  I'M HUMAN AND I'M PROUD.|`|jBOxQvMxaa	It all depends on whether or not you really believe that we came from apes.  I don't believe that.  I believe God created us all in his image.  If you are really questioning your existence, now might be a really good time to dig in and research evolution vs. creation.|`|6fD0r9Icaa	No way. I like being human, because humans are the most functional animals on this planet.|`|u6K5TtRlaa	No, not really, because I don't feel pointless. I rationalize my existence by thinking about the joy I bring to my loved ones, ie, my friends.    Even then, assuming that humans are pointless is to assume that all other animals are pointless, with which I also disagree. I think everything has a point. I don't think that there's any religious plan for it, no omnipotent or benevolent god to make it, but I think that everything has a point for no other reason than that it exists.    Beyond that, do you need a point to exist? Do you need a reason to be happy? I'm gonna eat as many sweet treats as I can while maintaining my health as well as I can, purely in order to eat as many more sweets as possible. Of course, other people have more profound goals in life, and I think those are also perfectly valid, as well. If you don't feel like humans have a point, give them a reason to exist, giving yourself one in the process.    Instead of complaining, just start doing something about it.|`|e93AlEACaa	Maybe if you develop an spiritual life, you will change your perspectives.  Having a human life is the most wonderful experience.  Good or Bad we are always learning, always getting better.  If you only knew how many spirits are waiting to incarnate, you will know how blessed you are to be in our beautiful planet.  Start with the beginning, we were created, we are the most perfect and complete creature on earth.  Just look at this wonder:  Pay attention of how many facial features and how many bodies a person goes through in his/her life, from baby to adulthood.  Do your own research, and be greatful. (Unless you are a creature from another planet!)  Other than that there is really no reason to hate our humanhood.|`|mtNxe7Nnaa	No not at all but some humans are a disgrace though.
HmXViQipaa	What's your age? Weight?  I would check my blood pressure.  Sometimes if your blood pressure falls to quickly..you might get dizzy or even faint.  Also, what about your blood sugar levels?  You might be diabetic.      Then again, it could be something to do with your inner ear.  There is water deep in the inner ear..If the water is constantly moving for some reason in the ear and you are standing still,..it could cause you to have dizzy spells..Just like when you were a kid and maybe spun around and around..when you stopped..you felt dizzy..the reason for this is b/c the water in the inner ear is still in motion..  The inner ear could have something to do with it!    Go see the doctor!!!|`|wqQf6IKqaa	see a doctor it MAY be series    Or it could just be natural like how i forget where i am for like the first 2min when i wake up BUT YOU REALLY SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR!! I really hope it isn't anything horrible.|`|DobKxnWBaa	Ummmmm.....you just get up to quickly it happens to everyone if your head is down for a while and you get up. its called getting light-headed. thats a good way to faint so i would take time getting up|`|dvevk1qbaa	allergies....your sinuses are messed up. That happens to me constantly. I am allergic to dust and when I get up that happens    also you may have a blood flow issue. DO you exercise normally? are you anemic? make sure you get enough iron and stretch/move regularly|`|0vhx7Putaa	That's the blood rushing to your head.  Is it like sitting up really fast after you have been laying down for awhile?|`|Ac9AzRHRaa	no, you're not crazy  that happens to me too sometimes  but not only when i wake up    maybe your dehydrated  try having something to drink next your bed while you sleep|`|9smhG69baa	you have orthostatic hypotension or a 'head rush'  your blood pressure drops for a second after you suddenly stand up and less blood gets to your brain  it is relativity normal, just get up slower and you should be fine|`|WnbaA1S0aa	It's probably because you get up too fast. It happens to me too. When you get up in the morning sit up slowly and try pacing yourself and it won't happen.|`|JfumPukYaa	you should see a dr.|`|DxZepZg7aa	i have the same problem.. kinda..  but all it is, is just you get up fast and your blood rushes to your head.  that happens to be but not that bad. i dont hear buzzin either. i would cheak it out.|`|bzxPBkbtaa	when you get up, take your time don't just rush up and start walking and see if that helps. I would definitely consider seeing a Dr though. Those types of symptoms apply to a lot of illnesses. Why take a risk.|`|645a76d1ad797b69ad89aeb363a4270aaa	I had a similar issue:  when I would wake up and walk down stairs like in the summer time the light would be so bright it would like burn and I couldnt open my eyes.  Also I used to pass out a lot and I would this like real "out of it " feeling then every thing would get dark and then I would pass out    Try eating something right when you wake up like a power bar or granola bar something that has a lot of nutrition and can help with energy. Dont do anything until you eat like half of it.... see if this helps its a common problem a lot of people have it is called like vessel vegal or something like that.    If it keeps happening go to the doctor.|`|RFJE5TzYaa	Greetings,    First - do see a doctor as this may be serious...    However it 'sounds' as if you are about to pass out.  Frequently before passing out it goes dark, ears buzz and any words sound muffled and at a distance, usually you'll go down.    You are recognizing it before it happens and holding on, which won't always work!    There could be a variety of reasons, if you wake up and hop up quickly, the blood may rush from your head causing this.    You also may be dehydrated...    You also may need better foods...    Personally, if I go to bed and sleep in very late (lounging on a weekend) I'll wake up STARVING and have gotten that exact same feeling a few times.  A handful of peanuts or a glass of milk helps me right away...    So, yes, check with the doctor, and yes, it could be something as simple as diet and dehydration.    As for the 'light', going into an enlightened state is by focus and choice.  It would not happen on accident like that...    ~A|`|biiAAZqtaa	It sounds like low blood pressure or something like that. That happens to me sometimes, particularly when I'm stressed. If you're really stressed or something it could be effecting you in the way you described. You might want to go to the doctor honey.|`|ng2kORCyaa	You're on crack|`|Lc6GbpTVaa	You may have had a stroke or something!  A woman at my school had one and didn't go to the doctor for 3 days!  you need to seek medical care!  It could be something less serious like inner ear infection or migraine.|`|L2HiIRBtaa	Well, i dont know about the part about your uncle.... oh and my ears don't do that buzzing thing    But sometimes in the morning i think that same thing happens to me.. i thought it wasn't normal... and i still dont think that it is. I've never really understood why it happens so i never asked and i just kept it to myself. So when i get up and i see a really bright light, it suddenly gets dark like i'm slowly becoming blind and i feel my eyes are getting bigger and it feels like i could only see a really tiny spot of light... like walking through a really long tunnel and the light of the other side is very far away.. and i feel like i cant see anything so once i almost hit the wall because of that.. then everything goes back to normal.    i don't know what it is.. and i'm just as worried about it.. i probably didn't help but i'm relieved i'm not the only one.|`|gXeuNSU6aa	It just sounds like most of the blood in your head rushes out of your head too quickly when you stand up.  This is very common and happens to most people; nothing to worry about.  However, if you get this feeling a lot when you are already standing and haven't done anything exhausting (walking, running, breathing heavily, etc...) then this could be an issue and you should see your doctor.    Basically, this is purely physiological, not psychological.  You aren't insane and it has nothing to do with the dream.  It is just blood rushing out of your head.|`|RJHaUs9Paa	its something to do with like the blood rushing, i get something like that....i go all lightheaded and kinda dark fuzz clouds my vision, maybe cause of hunger i mean you dont eat for a long time when you're asleep so it could be that...blood rushing out of your head, something like that....that dream sounds kinda scary though :/:/  |`|4fC6EJWfaa	Go to the doctor!|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	i think you should print that with the right spelling and show it to the doctor|`|ZYUpEdcqaa	Have you tried just getting up slowly and letting your body adjust to being back upright after laying down for a long time??  If that doesn't help, then you should probably go to the doctor.|`|wtIWal7Waa	I get that too. It usually happens when you stand up quickly. I suggest you drink much more water and see if that helps. It helps me.|`|f1i6DPHFaa	See a doctor. If this has been continually worse, then it could be something wrong. And, maybe it's nothing. But be safe and see a doctor.|`|exFsWQy7aa	you need to lay off the crack  haha|`|cjnBs0h6aa	um I dont know about your uncle, he sounds crazy. But when you get it up its probably the blood rushing to your head, that happens to me sometimes.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	YOU CRAZY!!!!! J/K J/K But You Should Go See A Doctor If Its Serious|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	you should consult someone.  i don't want to scare you, but this could be serious.  good luck. psychic might work...if you believe in that|`|qh9EOXKOaa	DUDE...see a doctor that could be something serious and if it happens on the road while you are driving you could cost your life or someone else|`|xHcQSLiVaa	You need to get your uncle to spill the beans.  Maybe check out a local medium.  Try relaxing and meditating, you might pick up something.  Read some Sylvia Brown or John Edwards.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	I'm no docrtor, but what it sounds like is orthostatic hypotension.  It's a sudden drop in blood pressure that is usually felt when you suddenyl get out of bed or stand from a sitting position.  This is not unusual for some people who may have average or even low blood pressure.  This can give you the spins and make you feel like you are going to faint.  If you are experiencing this more and more, get to your doctor and have your blood pressure taken.  If that doesn't seem to be the problem, then you might have to have some other tests done.

Z8qBgv8taa	Verbal and emotional including the intimidation bit ie throwing things      Physical: slapping, pushing, hitting, kicking, biting, etc.    Emotional: name-calling, putting down, insults, etc.    Sexual: being forced into sexual contact    Threats: "If you...I'll kill you!"    Intimidation: gestures, looks, smashing things    Isolation: being kept from seeing or talking to others, not allowed to go out.    Economic: being given an allowance, not allowed to have a job, etc.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	this sounds like emotional abuse.  of course, this also depends on what's being said and if it was just a one time thing.  if it's happened more than once, then you're probably looking at abusive behavior.  if it continues it won't be long before that thing being chucked actually hits you and turns physical.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	YES!  What the first responder said too.|`|8noe8TWkaa	it only counts as abuse if the thing hit you.|`|RFJE5TzYaa	Is this a one time thing done in rage?  Then perhaps no just someone in a bad mood.  Granted this mood could land them in jail for assault!    BUT if it's a frequent occurrence, then YES by all means it's abuse.      Mental.  Physical.  Verbal.    ~A|`|S8BCApc5aa	Well it's certainly aggressive behavior, and if it's not a rational response to the tension in a situation, then it probably is abuse. For example, if you ask to borrow five dollars from someone and they scream and throw things at you, then yeah, there's a serious problem there. If you're in their face, pushing them, and they scream and chuck things at you, it's probably a far more rational defense mechanism. But yes, if it is a complete overreaction to a situation or a random event not caused by anything, then I would call it abuse - probably verbal or emotional abuse (the physical aspect of the throwing stuff while yelling, imho, is not actually full physical abuse in this case in the normal sense - it seems like the intent is intimidation rather than actually physically hurting anyone). These can all be devastating traumas, especially if you don't make an attempt to follow up and heal in some sense (like people who just call the cops and feel better for a little while because the person got arrested, but never seek any further help - it always comes back to hurt you unless you confront the issue).|`|XKIOgWPRaa	Personally I consider abuse any form of words, physical things, or even giving dirty looks abuse. I mean if it offends you then its abuse.   I'd say its emotional. They didn't actually punch you or anything but I do feel like they were trying to intimidate you.|`|5YUqdpu0aa	It really depends on the context in which this took place. Was this incident one sided or was it an one time thing?  If its repetitive... then yes. If it was only the other person doing it all then yes.  But if you both said nasty things and were physical with eachother...Then I would have to say...Grow up people. the golden rule applies

We get so caught up with trying to be perfect and being what everyone else wants us to be that we lose sight of what life is about. Life is a gift that is meant to be enjoyed, where good times are great and bad time can be overcome. Sadly, we normally dont realize these things until we are faced with a life altering situation or until it is too late. So why let your life pass before you? You can easily find new friends that care about you, your family is your family no matter what, and this time period in your life will change.

Then you can be there for them when they are feeling exactly as you do now, because believe me, they will!|`|gBGuyVgUaa	I would like to advise you that FIRST you should prove that you hate living. Try this experiment:   Take a small flame. Expose the tip of your little finger to the flame and try to burn it a little (very little). If you pull out your finger from the flame and try to cool it down with cold water, if you think of applying some lotion to reduce the burning .. you still don't hate living.   Love or hate is in the mind. Mind is the master of your body. If your mind refuses to punish even a small part of your body, it means you love life. Hence, forget about all this hate, go out to the world, help some stranger on the road and observe his eyes thereafter, you will start loving your life. Continue the style and you will find friends. If you have any serious depression problem (medical), consult a doctor.|`|Lc6GbpTVaa	Then change your life!  Of course it won't be perfect in one day, but just pick one thing everyday that you CAN do!  Me I broke up w/ my abusive boyfriend of 3 years and went back to graduate school - and I'm 40 so it is definitely not too late for you!  I started going to a different church that is more casual and has upbeat music.  I also thought about what did I used to do when I was happy, so I started going canoeing w/ a group called Eco-Action & we pick up trash from Lakes & rivers to protect the animals.  Tomorrow I am going to take a piano lesson.  I am lonely too at the moment, but it is getting better little by little!  Don't deprive people of the pleasure of knowing the real you!  Not everyone gets along well, and that's ok.  Pick some group activities that you can do- and don't tell me you can't pick up trash! :)  I haven't laughed so hard for a while.  We found a huge wheelbarrow in the lake and 2 guys put it in my little one-person canoe.  I could barely move through the algae, but I didn't tip over.  What is the point?  There isn't one.  Just surviving is all you can do sometimes.  I just truly try to be grateful for what I have - legs, arms my head! shelter food my voice etc even little tiny things can focus your joy!  I went to a job fair and they gave out free pens!  Woo hoo free pens!  you get the idea.  Don't feel you have to live up to ANY standard or anything.   Do something nice for someone else.  Simple as call them and ask them how are they?  It is free, right?|`|AA12255146	things will change. this is just a part of life we all go through. maybe hormones? maybe someone is making it tough on you? you need to speak to someone, and get all that stuff off of your chest that builds up, it will make you feel better.|`|lMRiEoltaa	plz dont if you need anyone to talk to you can talk to me. suicide is a no no you will find friends one day who you like. and i bet your family dont hate you.|`|AA11642531	Please look in the telephone book and call your local suicide hot line.

AA11562077	Well, you certainly sound disturbed, so that is a fact. My suggestion is to see a competent therapist (preferably a psychologist rather than a psychiatrist so you don't fall into the current vogue of 'Diagnose-and-Drug').    I agree with the earlier answer who said that your question, as is, is too unclear to give practical advice.  But the specific, very specific wording of your complaint is troubling. ("Holograms", "various techniques", "my entire social circle...knows", "questioning an alarm...", etc). These are all pretty hard to interpret or even grasp.    I won't jump to the conclusion that these point to some leaning toward the paranoid, but only say that the usage of terms like these which mean VERY specific things to the person who uses them and are not easily understood by the listener are characteristic of people who have at least begun to take refuge in a private reality.    So why don't you help us by 'Adding Details' and explain what you mean by "using Holograms"?  That's certainly a choice of words that is unusual enough to deserve some expansion to be able to understand what you mean.    Or email me if you prefer and I will try to offer what suggestions I can privately.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	i'm afraid this doesn't make a whole lot of sense without the details you're leaving out.  what makes you think he's been playing mind games with you?  how do you know?  how do you know your social circle is involved somehow?  can you elaborate more.|`|Z8qBgv8taa	I would consider it psychological or mental abuse not really harrasment.   Psychological abuse is the willful infliction of anguish by verbal or non-verbal conduct.|`|VsuuVs7Kaa	How do you know I'm not involved?
gkqSk29Zaa	it's through experiences in life that you can take and move on.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	when things get you down remember it isn't the event or person, it is the way you react to it. If you dwell on something then it will fester like a boil and eventually burst, like a volcano your temper can rise then explode, when you are feel ing down think of some happier time, or do anything housework, walking, gardening you will soon be thinking about something else. To be mentally strong is to rise above stupid or ignorant people or events you have no control over ie the past for instance, it can get you down thinking over past regrets but it is just that in the past let it go, move on and live for the present.|`|Ek0eDO00aa	Yeah, but as the person above states it requires application and a method. Do something challenging - join the armed forces, do an extreme sport, do something that takes you right out of your comfort zone, fail and come back for more.|`|TXaMOQo6aa	take a sheet of paper. draw a little dot in the middle. concentrate on that dot for as long as you can. It will help you get mentally stringer, though I'm not sure if you mean mentally as in comebacks or being able to concentrate on stuff|`|AA10781962	Lift some psychological weights.|`|JxowGsKYaa	you only learn what you study.....|`|DYVWtJ8Oaa	concerntrate on a sequence of number eg   1 17 2 9 8 22 18 1 turn the paper over and try and rewrite them. it is d bomb!<br>  plus eat plenty of fish.|`|Kn1xIPrzaa	experience loss, go through shitty times and rise up like a phoenix<br>  <br>  being mentally strong means that you can take a lot of stress

The key is confidence.  Believe in yourself and say what is on your mind.  I'm sure you have a great personality.  Good luck!|`|D9fd7a9Uaa	just remember<br>  <br>  no1 gives a **** about anything u say, anything u do, or anyway u act. remember that and then u wont feel so damn shy.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	It's not you up on stage. There is no "you" to get anxious. Stage fright just happens, and not TO anyone. Indifference is where you need to get to if you want what confidence appears to offer.
