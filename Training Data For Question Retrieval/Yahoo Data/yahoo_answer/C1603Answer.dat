g7M1DxFCaa	I was building myself a nice career by 1990 at the age of 20 but I decided that wasn't what I wanted, that was far too young to be getting so serious about life.  I bought a coach and converted it into a nice home (heat, electricity, running h+c water, nice furniture etc) which was perfectly possible as the average one bed flat isn't any bigger.  I packed in my job and hit the road.  Well too much has happened in the last eighteen years to go into here but yes, it was an adventure and a really good way of life, if maybe harder in some ways.  At the time friends and family thought I must be mad to do such a thing, but I'm so glad I did.  I've met so many people along the way, made so many good friends and had a lot of fun as well.  I've been asked before if I'd do it again if I had my time over again, I certainly would but I wouldn't have waited until I was twenty.  I myself have been living in a house in the midlands with my daughter since last year, when she grows up and leaves home I shall certainly hit the road again for the rest of my life - maybe we'll do it together before then, who knows?  It takes courage to take the plunge but as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained.  When I'm an old man I'll have plenty of stories to tell the grandchildren - that wouldn't be the case if I'd worked in a factory all my life, would it?|`|aFALNf2oaa	omg i just posted a question about running off and travelling :-)<br>  I just want to travel theres more to life than england!!<br>  <br>  im from midlands 2 :-)<br>  <br>  we should go together leave behind routine boring life ?<br>  <br>  <br>  x|`|zEoRcL91aa	We moved from Cape Town, South Africa to Berlin and the move was very good for us, but traveling for the sake of traveling is not really a good reason to hit the road.

tGjI8syRaa	June is the end of the "long "rains" in Kenya and it is usually finished by the end of the 2nd week in June, but hey its the weather so that can fluctuate.  the good news is that it rains generally 2-3 hrs a day and generally in the afternoon--when i was living there it was almost like clockwork.<br>  Good time to go?  For prices it is better than high season, but you will have to put up with the rain and the water visibility around the reef is not as good as other times as there is runoff from the rivers due to the rain so your snorkeling/scuba diving will be impacted.<br>  In sum;  if you dont care about a couple hours of rain a day, additional clouds, and water visibility this is a great time to go and save a few bucks in the process.  If you want a rockin' tan, incredible scuba/snorkeling, and 9+hrs of sun a day this is not the best time.|`|tynALT5Jaa	Hi,<br>  Well June is indeed a rainy season but at most it only rains for two hours before the sun comes out again.

wE7lLCHSaa	I'm going to be bold and answer this even though I'm American not Australian.<br>  <br>  I've lived in Taiwan for six years.  As far as Asia goes, I would highly recommend it.<br>  <br>  I haven't taught in the other countries but I've met people who have.  <br>  Japan is the most popular and as such is saturated with teachers.  Thus you won't be competitively compensated -- you will not likely earn more than enough to get by if you go through a school.  Maybe $250000-$300000 a month.  Good luck living on that in a big city.<br>  <br>  I've heard Korea is similar to Taiwan money-wise.  Similar salary (a little less then Japan), but the cost of living is much lower.  I've also heard there is a fair degree of xenophobia there.  Hard to say for sure.<br>  <br>  I can vouch personally for xenophobia in China.  It is much worse than Taiwan.  I spent three months traveling around there and had people mocking me, harassing me, even swearing at me in Chinese because I figured out they were trying to scam me.  There are also a lot of *habits* there that Westerners don't tend to like (hocking spit everywhere, littering, cutting in line, glaring at you).  The pay is less than everywhere else too.  Visit China, definitely, but never never work there.<br>  <br>  I think Thailand is pretty relaxed.  Thais were friendly and approachable when I traveled there.  I don't know too much about the work environment though.  <br>  <br>  I recommend Taiwan.  Friendly people who may be a bit shy sometimes but never look down on you, never try to rip you off, etc.  It's polluted and crowded, and the traffic is mind-blowingly chaotic, but those things get easier to handle with time.  And you can live pretty well here on the $50-60 thousand Taiwan dollars a month.|`|4f13e0de90f26d6c931fca1e03c59429aa	Westerners teach all over the place but all the ones I have met got bored of the low pay and same place and usually moved on to<br>  another job or another country.
VufgMhI2aa	Sri Lanka has been in a civil war for quite long now, and I'm surprised you don't know about it.<br>  A group of people, who call themselves the "Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam" have been fighting against the government for "liberation" of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka, who believe they have been repressed by the Sinhalese people.<br>  The LTTE is quite well organised and have a full fledged army. They even have a navy (Sea Tigers) and an air force (Air Tigers) <br>  There is even a suicide squad called Black Tigers.<br>  The two planes that attacked Colombo (Capital city of Sri Lanka) were on a Kamikaze mission, but failed.<br>  BTW, I''m not Sri Lankan, But I'm Indian.|`|D8sMuoCpaa	The Tamil Tigers have been around for over 20 years. They are a northern clan. They also have a navy. <br>  America will have nothing to do with this conflict. They have ignored it for a couple of decades now and there is no oil in Sri Lanka, only very good tea.|`|TWsxP46Qaa	one mans terrorist is anothers freedom fighter,yes they have planes n tanks etc ,they are a break away from the regular armed services|`|9lPolnykaa	Tamil tigers' planes were shot down before they could bomb their target which was the Srilankan airforce (from what is in the media). The damage done to the government buildings are the result of the plane being shot down by the Srilankan Army. Tamil tigers (LTTE) are not terrorist, they are a separatist group in Srilanka fighting for their own homeland. The only reason they are labeled a terrorist organization is because the bush administration declared a "war on terrorism" and decided that any militant groups acting against a political power are considered terrorist. America has no vested interest in srilanka and therefore will not take any military action.

From long before the formation of Benelux and its expansion the Irish have been free to enter, live in, vote etc.in GB and N.Ireland. This insertion was made by a very senior civil sevant who was a native of Ireland(Sothern) who would have otherwise lost his job because foreigners cannot work in the UK Civil Service.much of the trouble in Northern Ireland was the result of immigration of workless people from the South who wanted to benefit from the vastly better social services and especially subsidised Council housing.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	No, Ireland is part of the EU even if it is not part of the UK.

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	I used to work for Haven Holidays in their Holiday Sales Department.<br>  <br>  Trust me - there is worse to come.<br>  <br>  The accommodation that is reserved for you is the worst on the site. (The best goes to those paying the full rate!)<br>  <br>  About six weeks before you go, you will be plagued with telephone calls offering you an "upgrade" at a reduced rate. Sure it is reduced, ￡50 instead of ￡55. If you refuse, then you will be allocated the least attractive accommodation. (If you seek an upgrade on arrival, then expect to pay ￡75+ for it, if it is available)<br>  <br>  Oh, and they have yet to charge you the ￡40 for security passes, otherwise if you leave the place, security will not let you back in.|`|doLyOac0aa	Chavtastic!|`|QoVL5cDHaa	Yes, this is quite common. You can't do much about the summer supplement if you have requested to go at peak time (if you want to avoid that next time ask to go in March, April, May, September or October) or the service charge. If you look in the small print near the name of the park in the brochure/newspaper, it does tell you about this.<br>  If you are prepared to take your own bedlinen (charge does not include towels), just write "not required" on the invoice when you send payment. You can also refuse the passes, but that means you won't be able to get into the clubhouse for any nightly entertainment, and you may not get access to the bar, depending on club layout. Again note invoice, and send payment for summer supplement and service charge, and other services if you want them.<br>  Another time, compare service charges and entertainment pass charges between camps. They vary in price according to the camp, and they may be free at slack holiday times. You must read the small print in the brochure/newspaper.|`|aSs0tfjUaa	Did you read the small print when you took up they offer?<br>  <br>  The reason I ask is with offers like this they normally tempt you with headline offers but the small print contains lots of extras you are agreeing to pay. <br>  <br>  There's still truth in the old adage "You get what you pay for."|`|kMK9E2a7aa	Should have come to Spain, it would have been cheaper including the flight.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	nothing is cheap in this world it's a con all the time,never again buy the sun.|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	It is always the same - that is how they make their money.<br>  You usually have to pay for random stuff, like electricity on top of it.|`|f42b59297654b7eb6918a980d6b6cf64aa	Yes we did one to the coast and it does say FROM ￡9.50 only a few of the parks give you free entertainment passes etc its called "read the small print" I'm afraid!|`|ANmnjaYtaa	do u no in america they have to use 3 million trees a week to make the newpapers for america....wow  star *

It's easy to look at another population from the outside and draw conclusions...but every nationality has its greedy and arrogant people, as well as selfless and generous people. Money may make it easier to spot those natures - but the root behaviours were already there. Some are heartless at their core, and some are not. Where they are situated on the planet plays very little part in that.<br>  <br>  Wealth just puts a spotlight on things.

nEgJAtK7aa	Travel insurance is not a scam. I am a travel agent and I have seen a lot of people who had to cancel because of death or sickness to immediate family member and they received all of their money back.<br>  Last fall I had a couple that went to Vegas to get married and the day after the wedding the brides father passed away. They called and wanted a flight home immediately. If they did not have the insurance it was going to cost them $800 to fly home on a 1 way plane ticket. They were reimbersed all of their money.<br>  The main reason to get insurance when leaving the US is for the medical. Most insurance does not cover you once you leave the US. Travel insurance has coverage for this. If you were to get injured or sick in Mexico they will not look at you without knowing they will get paid. I always get travel insurance prior to traveling. If I know for sure I will not be canceling then I get no trip cost insurance it is much less and gives me the medical coverage in case anything happens while I am gone. Also gives you trip interruption in case you had medical emergency at home and need to cut your trip short.<br>  Trip delay is the only stickey part. Some will only cover for weather delays of 8-12 hours and do not cover for mechanical delay. You would just have to check the details of the policy you are looking at. <br>  I had someone that did not get insurance and they ended up with a $5000 medical bill from having to make a trip to the hospital. <br>  I hope this helps. Have fun on your trip.|`|hKU2wgDeaa	go with <a href="http://www.simplyinsurancequotes.com/travelguard-insurance-quote.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.simplyinsurancequotes.com/tra...</a> and you'll pay about $25 each. <br>  It is definitely worth the peace of mind, definitely not a scam, they have offices all over the place and will help you if you are in trouble.|`|fM7CwTwzaa	Generally, no. <br>  <br>  Travel insurance is so full of loopholes and exclusions, that even if your trip does get cancelled, chances are excellent that you'll never recover a dime.

We have thousands of thousands of unemployed Canadians looking for jobs too. What few jobs there are out there will not go to foreigners who come here without a job offer. Because of the worsening economy, there is an ever growing call to tighten up our borders. We have enough problems trying to find work for our own citizens and no company here will offer a job to a foreigner if there is a qualified Canadian citizen who can do the job.<br>  <br>  My advice for you would be to stay where you are until the economy improves, whenever that may be. It isn't that you would not be welcome just that now is a VERY BAD time to try and immigrate.

XS8XRwpnaa	Yes it's spelled M?r?i?or in Romanian, and we still celebrate it in Romania, Moldova and Bulgaria. I'm not really sure about Bulgaria It could be a little different, but In Romania and Moldova M?r?i?or is the Holiday we celebrate on March 1'st, It's the Holiday of spring. On March 1'st people give each other M?r?i?or ( they can be very different, but they have to be made of 2 colors- red and white) and we congratulate each other with the coming of spring.<br>   I'm not sure I'm explaining this very good, because my English is not so good.<br>  This is how an usual M?r?i?or looks:  <a href="http://ro.7hot.net/posting.jpg/1817" rel="nofollow">http://ro.7hot.net/posting.jpg/1817</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If you have any questions, you can email me.<br>  <br>  If you want to know more:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%83r%C5%A3i%C5%9For" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%83r%C5...</a><br>  <br>  Edit:  Not only women wear M?r?i?or, everybody wears it.

They had a M?r?i?or (I don't remember the correct name in Bulgarian) stuck in the upper left corner. <br>  <br>  I thought it was very interesting that they should celebrate Spring as a new season, because we didn't have that particular custom where I was born (Serbia), except for the official beginning of Spring on March 21st.|`|9gFJgl29aa	Ye, we still celebrate it. But it`s very hard to find a decent m?r?i?or. That is because so manz are in bad taste. The red adn white strings mean something like the yin and yang. <br>  And only the women wear them. (I think it would be nice for men to wear them too)
WbWBxDhiaa	Toronto will be MUCH cheaper. the Quality of life is good in both cities, but London is so crowded, its inevitable that land is expensive. Also, because a lot of basic foods (like fuit or grains) need to be imported from very far, food is priced higher. Canada is closer to tropical countries and has the best wheat in the world a few provinces down. <br>  PLUS, the euro/pound is SOOOO much higher and expensive compared to the Canadian dollar. If youre coming from the UK, things will be cheaper to you.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Most things cost about a third less than in the UK....|`|3QsPl1uLaa	I believe everything is much cheaper. This is partly due to our tax structure which taxes income rather than consumption. Also we have a free enterprise system unlike the UK. Food prices here are not generally set artificially high  as they are in the Common Market. Canada does not have the disease of trade unions the way the UK does.

Gossiping is when I share some hot juicy tidbits with my friends.  When I gossip I stick to the truth although I would tend to add my personal views to the core story.  For example:  My friend Lisa tells me she might be pregnant.  She further tells me don't tell the others yet until it's confirmed.  This is too good to be kept under wraps so I call Jenny and Amy and tell them "hey, Lisa could be pregnant" - that's the core story.  Now here comes my "embellishment" - I think it happened when she was in Florida..blah...blah...blah.  <br>  <br>  We're all good friends; everyone would know eventually.<br>  <br>  Gossiping here at YAP is when we talk about Jaimee and her OOucH.  <br>  <br>  Spreading rumor, on the other hand, is not my thing.

5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	Generally theres only 3 category: infant, child, adult. <br>  <br>  Im sure many people would like to have more categories like teenager, middle age, senior citizen etc it is not possible for airline to come up with so many different prices.<br>  <br>  Anyways, many 12yr old already consume as much food as a normal adult. Their age and mental health might still be immature but many do take up as big a seat as an adult and is not as noisy as other children and also would not need assistance in going to the bathroom alone etc. Judging by all this, the airlines decide to promptly charge them as adults.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	it is a money making idea they steal off passengers<br>  <br>  it should be illegal to charge anyone under the age of 18 a full paying price fare at all|`|86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	Some airlines offer discounts for children UNDER 18 yrs. old on international flights, check around. At least on most international flights you can get a discount for children under 12, on domestic flights there are no airlines that I know of that offer discounts for kids over 2. As a parent myself, I can sympathize with you, I'm used to paying full fare on many flights for my 7 yr. old. Check around though, depending on where you're going internationally, some airlines have youth fares for kids under 18.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	One thing I've learned about airlines and ages is that you need to show proof of the person's age.<br>  <br>  There was this one situation on the show ,Airline, where Southwest didn't allow a family with a 10 month on board for free because they couldn't prove the child's age. I think that was a clear case of wanting money-The child did not look 1 or 2. It was very young and an obvious case.<br>  <br>  I think they do want to make money when they clearly know the age of the child.<br>  <br>  12 years old is not an adult in society so they shouldn't be considered one in terms of airlines.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	It's tied in with the rates the Hotels and Motels charge...they use those age demographics on family specials in Hotels, and thus...<br>  <br>  The inaccurate age categorization for the sake of anything better...|`|AA10628838	Some 12 year olds are as big as adults.|`|JEMtVVkBaa	lets look at this from an airlines point of view.<br>  <br>  12 year olds are very likley to eat the same food, and use the same basic services as an adult. They are going to eat, drink, burp, fart, pee and poo like any other adult on that plane. Airlines dont care about size, they base their price structure on how much a passenger is going to use.<br>  <br>  With the spelling of Fare...well thats just like the old "there, their and they're", or Plane and Plain (as another answere has confused the two). its an Airfare, not an Airfair.<br>  <br>  If you complain about those, then I wouldnt like to see you travel to exotic places!|`|WfwFuQB0aa	makes you wonder what they call someone 0-2 doesn't it.<br>  <br>  seems to me that the child age is getting lower and lower these days, just don't let a 12+ person see it or you could be in all sorts of trouble.<br>  <br>  i have a 37 yo and he was a child, in my opinion until 35 when he suddenly grew up.   mind you he is still MY baby.<br>  <br>  you can also experience the same problem when you find accommodation which states a family, 2 adults and 2 children but doesn't always specify the age of the child.     i have often been tempted to go as 1 adult and 2 children (37 and 39 yo).   after all they are my children, and i am foregoing 1 adult.<br>  <br>  oops forgot to answer your question yes it is a way of making money.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The definition of an adult depends purely on context.  For an airline, an adult may be anyone who occupies a seat, or anyone who occupies a seat and weighs about the same as an adult.  Seats and weight cost money in the airline industry.  Whether a passenger is old enough to drive, vote, or drink beer is irrelevant.|`|1NWjta2jaa	They are not telling you she is an adult in a legal sense.

That's just crazy.|`|AA11922229	Many 12 year olds are 70-100% the weight of an average adult, and they carry as much luggage. Think about the luggage.

f4759393d980deadc3255b5837265f76aa	Leaving London will not be a problem.  Getting through US Immigration will probably be a problem though.  You can contact the US Embassy and ask OR change the flight.  You primary risk is being sent back to London (or wherever home might be) without ever getting out of the airport.  It may or may not happen, but that is the risk.
f1lpdiNEaa	Hi there. My boyfriend's job is temporarily moving to Gibraltar in the Summer. We've been for an orientation visit and to view properties. <br>  <br>  I found Gibraltar pretty similar to the UK, maybe like a small town over here, with a highstreet with stores like M&S, Topshop, Monsoon. There's a square with more shops and a pub/restaurants, nothing in the way of a nightclub (you'd have to go to Spain for that). There's a new centre that's just been built with bowling, cinema and iceskating. All those prices are similar/the same as the UK.<br>  <br>  As for accomodation we're looking at apartments near the Marina where's there's bars, shops and restaurants. All really modern and still being developed. Rent is very expensive in Gibraltar. It can vary between ￡1000-￡4000pcm. For example a 2 bed 2 bathroom furnished apartment over the marina is roughly ￡2000pcm.<br>  <br>  A lot of the modern apartment blocks have communal pools, gardens and gyms onsite (there's a membership fee for the gyms) and look nice inside/modern etc. <br>  <br>  There is apparently a big ex pat community where you can join sports teams/clubs etc. I've not looked into those yet but apparently you can look it up online. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps. Good luck with it all.

It's spelled like in やくざ Hiragana or ヤクザ in Katakana.<br>  <br>  The main one is Yamaguchi-gumi 六代目山口組 (Rokudaime Yamaguchi-gumi). It's based in Kobe, Japan and was founded by Harukichi Yamaguchi in 1915. It's known to recruit both Japanese and Japanese Koreans (naturalized Koreans in Japan). Their membership is around 39,000 which dwarfs other organized crime groups. It also operates in the USA and other Asian countries. The current Kumicho (head) is Shinobu Tsukasa. In 2007, one of their senior members assassinated Iccho Itoh, the mayor of Nagasaki and was sentenced to death in 2008.<br>  <br>  Others include Sumiyoshi-kai (住吉会) which has about 10,000 members, Inagawa-kai (稲川会) which has about 5,000 and Tōa-kai (東亜会) which has about 1,000 members.

These days they are just criminals dressed in nice clothes, even though they still entertain a connection with society far beyond crime organisations in the West..<br>  <br>  One interesting anecdote concerning yakuza relates to the visit of US president LBJ to japan in about 1964. The local law enforcement couldn't supply enough men to satisfy US requirements. So the Japanese police contacted one of the major yakuza groups who mobilized about 10,000 'gang' members, dressed smartly in nice suits, to serve as security for the US President!

DbTJruA2aa	Depends on what you like but most of the best things involve the landscape, history, food & wine or all of them, and how long you have<br>  <br>  In and around Hobart there's the Cascade Brewery tour, Salamanca markets, cruises (I recommend the Bruny Island or Tasman Peninsular eco-tours), a trip to Mt Wellington (there's even a company that does the down hill part by bicycle), lots of Georgian architecture in Battery point, geat pubs with the best Tassie beer. Day trips from Hobart to Pt Arthur or the Tahune Airwalk are great so is a winery trip in the Coal River Valley, and if you can afford it an air tour to Lake Pedder <br>  <br>  A bit further from Hobart Feycinet in the east cost is breathtaking and includes the world famous Wineglass Bay. Strahn on the west coast with the South West wilderness, Cradle Mtn and Lake St Clair.<br>  If you like hiking theres also lots of places and opportunity, also fishing this time of year is great|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	What you could not do anywhere, you can do it in Tasmania.|`|vOnzG05Qaa	If you go to Launceston, you must check out the Cataract Gorge. Its a beautiful place. Down the east Coast of Tassie are some really nice beaches. Binalong Bay & wineglass bay are a couple of favourites. Salamanca Market in Hobart is good, its on every Saturday. Port Arthur & the Tahune Airwalk are both interesting spots to go in the South. Up the West Coast Strahan is a really nice little village & from there you can take a cruise up the Gordon River. There is really heaps to see & do. Tassie is one of the most beautiful places there is. Don't make the mistake alot of people do & think you can see the whole state in a couple of days. Cant be done. its bigger than you think
hfigZbx5aa	I'm not in South Africa, but the same exact thing is happening here. First they claim it has to be up because oil prices are hurting them so badly, and now they claim that it's because they "just increased the cost to barely break even when oil increased" and that "now they are trying to earn enough profit for the medical insurance/bonuses/paychecks of employees" and whatever other ****-and-bull story they've created. I think the sociological reason that people don't figh it is the same reason. You can openly oppose government, but people have sort of always accepted food prices and other business prices. People have to eat so it's difficult to get people to boycott grocers, so they have no incentive to lower the prices. The other problem is that everybody always assumes that everybody ELSE will do something about it. It sounds rediculous, but it happens a lot in many places. Americans are VERY weak in the private sector. Instead of saving children from child abuse and funding domestic violence shelters, you have Sarah Mclachlan making ads for animal abuse. With anti-violence shelters and homeless shelters combined, in the USA there are more shelters and there is more funding for ANIMALS than for human beings. And it's simply because people find domestic violence and homelessness to be uncomfortable to talk about. It's controversial, yet people who save animals are more highly regarded. <br>  It's gotten to a point where people just go with what's socially expected and don't do anything innovative to solve the problem at all. I guess what I'm trying to summarize is that businesses feel they can rip you off because people will always choose convenience over practicality. It's part of our nature as a species. And it's a good business move. Unfortunately, it screws over the people. <br>  <br>  It would be nice to see South Africans stand up and fight back though. Maybe you guys can show us Americans how it's done. ;-) Lord knows the only way we'll do anything here is because the only time the average American jumps to fix anything is when someone ELSE has done it and now suddenly their ego feels threatened and they must now "do whatever it was better". Note NASA, which has just launched another satellite from its Polar Operational Environmental Satellite programme or "POES Project". Americans with any knowledge of foreign languages are facepalming everywhere....|`|HzjeKsDJaa	I know same thing in the USA, Food prices never dropped! ITS BULL CRAP! If Zimbabwe didn't have racist Policies you would have plenty of food, evicting farmers just because they are white is the dumbest move|`|lDJWOEQSaa	For once this is a flippen good question ! South Africans has lost their ability to bargain hunt due to a lot of reasons . Convenient locations or retail outlets etc. Then the pride factor that we do not publicly want to ask for discount because it might look that we have financial difficulty . Always keeping up with the neighbors ! As long as retailers can get more for their product they will keep the higher prices . Their is no real Competition between hi profile retail outlets like Pick and Pay and spar anymore ! Statistics show that people who shop at Pick and Pay will 9 times out of 10 return to for their monthly groceries even if Spar is cheaper on 5 different products. Reasons being location, convenience and the fact that we are creatures of habit .|`|AA11326712	It does seem to be a global ailment.  Prices rarely go down again once they have shot up.  But, we did not vote for the prices or the supermarkets.  There we can only vote with our feet, and buy from the cheapest and fairest supplier. <br>  <br>  Yet, the government is voted in to do a good job, so when they fail, people have a good right to complain.  And the government should be seeing to it that the inflation does not rise so high, then the prices will remain stable for longer.<br>  <br>  In South Africa there is also a POES project. It′s an Afrikaans thing.

80269aeda3702b582796c6b2c8b224b9aa	There are a few countries to be careful in.  The major cities of Spain(Barcelona), Italy (Naples, Rome) and France(Paris) are places where you should be careful.  This should not discourage you from visiting any of these places, the people that are trying to rip you off represent only 5% of the population.  <br>  <br>     Example-Naples in Italy has a particularly bad reputation regarding theives, however this is my favorite destination!!  My Italian friends are always warning me to be careful about my stuff.  And if you are not like me and speak Italian/have Italian friends you find the locals in Italy will often warn you w/ their eyes to watch your belongings.<br>  <br>  Other countries such as Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia( where I was born) are very safe in general.  However in any major city watch your stuff, there are a lot of Gangs that come out of countries such as Romania.  These gangs operate in most major European cities ( Vienna, Paris, Rome, Naples, Barcelona).  Any touristy area is where these gangs operate.  They operate in many forms.  Pick pocketing, scamming etc.  A good example is someone will pull up in their car and be overly friendly.  They will offer you something to you for free and at the very end say something like "  Oh I forgot my wallet at home and live on the other side of town.  Could you give me 10 Euro so I can make it home?"  These people have not spent any money on the free item they are giving you and are looking to make a quick 10 Euro.<br>  <br>  If you know what to look for you will be fine.  If something seems wrong about the area your in, don't stick around.  Walk with confidence as if you know where your going ( even if you don't).  Above everything else, enjoy Europe, no matter which country you travel to!!!|`|9e3125f1cbec258838efea7ac306d1c1aa	Crime against tourists is very rare in most of Europe.  And it differs much more between cities than between countries.  Barcelona, Rome, and Naples have the most petty theft in Western Europe, but the Spanish and Italian countryside are mostly very safe.  Athens has the biggest problem with scams against tourists, but the Greek Islands are very safe.  No problems at all in Scandinavia, Germany, Austria, or Switzerland.<br>  <br>  Albania and Kosovo are the most dangerous places in Europe, but they get very few tourists.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	I was in a French restaurant.  I got up to get a napkin and the waiter came over and snatched it away from be because my entree was not expensive enough to warrant a napkin!

I have found the pickpockets in Rome dastardly|`|zEoRcL91aa	Probably countries like Italy, Spain and s. France. Parts of Germany in the cities are not always safe, as many foreigners come in from e. europe to pick pocket.|`|URP0nFQXaa	france has pickpockets but not the worst watch the netherlands|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I don't think any particular country stands out, tourists everywhere are fair game for petty thieves.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Unfortunatley most governments don't break down crime statistics into those against tourists vs. locals. It could lose them millions of euro if they ever publicly showed the true extent of crime against tourists.<br>  <br>  France, Italy and Spain are all bad for pickpockets.There are gangs from places like Romania, Albania, etc operating throughout Europe. <br>  <br>  Even in Denmark, which has a very low crime rate, there has been an increase in pickpocketing by Romanian gangs <a href="http://www.gadling.com/2008/12/12/pickpockets-in-copenhagen-gadling-bloggers-victim-story-part/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gadling.com/2008/12/12/pickpo...</a>
9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	..... the image of the rural South has been distorted by Hollywood.Yes true that at one point in history there may have been tight knit communities where there was "inbreeding".But in the modern South there is a different view of the area.The education and cultural level os much greater and in some cases rivals the cultural and industrial areas of the country.<br>   Today more than 99% of the rural south has running water and electricity.Grant it there are areas where the roads are not paved but they are well maintained.Schooling is available and education is a major focus of the social area.It varies from state to state but over 80% of the region known as the "south" has High School education.Even the college graduation level is topping 75%.<br>   So for the area it is very much a well developed section of the country.And unlike the movies which do portray the south as uneducated hillbilly's this is not normal.And this stereotype will live on because of the image that was made in Hollywood.|`|1cJjGNOBaa	first let me say that I read ALL the answers thus far, and I really didn't think anyone answered with a rude or angry reply. That said... what you see and hear are stereotypes, which of course, DO have their basis in fact (otherwise they wouldn't be so widespread). Back when the south was being established, it was a pretty poor area and people routinely didn't have much of an education, which in turn meant they didn't live very luxuriously. Many areas didn't have electricity or indoor plumbing- and actually, there ARE still a few areas that don't, but people still either choose to live there or must live there. In the larger cities and suburbs you will find a lot of SOuthern transplants- people who have moved here from across the nation because of its beauty, cheaper cost of living, and many other wonderful amenities. I moved here with my daughters and grandchildren 8 years ago from Las Vegas for these very reasons and love it here (near Nashville, TN).<br>  I remember that before our first trip to England, a friend of mine from there was worried that I would find people "cold"- as seems to be a common stereotype. We found everyone we met to be warm and helpful. I think people are basically the same everywhere, with slight differences due to area and culture, but overwhelmingly "normal" the world over!|`|QqXpkatHaa	What...like Memphis, Birmingham or even Atlanta?

In fact, the stereotype of the south that I'm accustomed to is completely different from yours. People usually assume I will talk with a southern drawl, although I never even use words like "y'all" or "howdy." The stereotype of an American that you describe is how many Virginians think of West Virginians, although that is also untrue in most cases.<br>  However, there are people across the country who do live in poor conditions. Although my family is fairly well-off (annual income of over $200,000), there are people living in severe poverty just a few counties over from mine.<br>  Basically, no. The south has electricity. That stereotype applies only to a small number of people scattered across the nation.|`|owpQPYGPaa	Seeing as how i am from the Southern US I can say for a fact that not everyone is like that and it is jsut a stereotype, though like all stereotypes you can definitely find ppl that fit that description if you look hard enough but then you probably can anywhere not just here.|`|YYRb6oE3aa	No, it is not true.

yKIr3C40aa	The JET program is an option, but you will not get placed in Tokyo. Closest you can get is a suburb of Tokyo, probably 30+ minute train ride away. The JET program is very competitive, and if you ask to be placed in or near Tokyo, you will probably be hurting your chances of being accepted. Also, the application process is yearly, and the applications are usually due in November, for placement the following summer.<br>  <br>  There are private teaching jobs in Tokyo, but they pay less than the JET program, usually on the order of 250,000 yen per month. That is not a great salary for Tokyo, since it is the most expensive city in Japan (and one of the most expensive in the world).<br>  <br>  Japan is in a very deep recession right now, and jobs are scarce for everyone.

kgBPU4xxaa	Ciampino advises getting to the airport 2.5 hours before your flight on their FAQ, but for a 6:30 flight, you don't really need to be at the airport that much in advance. Generally I'd try to be there around 5 am or a little later. If you wait much later, you'll be standing in line for checking in for some time. I'm flying on an earlier flight than that Wednesday morning , but not from Ciampino, and expect to be at the airport at about 5. <br>  <br>  The earliest shuttle bus from Roma Termini station is at 4:45 am and takes about 40 minutes for the trip: <a href="http://www.schiaffini.com/AlPercorrenze2.asp?Loc=28&Sub=72&p=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.schiaffini.com/AlPercorrenze2...</a><br>  <br>  Terravision also operates a shuttle between Roma Termini and Ciampino that is timed to coincide with flights from some of the budget airlines, but you have to be ticketed on one of those airlines to get a ticket: <a href="http://www.terravision.eu/rome_ciampino.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.terravision.eu/rome_ciampino....</a><br>  <br>  A cab will be 30 euro, but you can expect a small additional supplement for very late/early trips.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Been a long time since I've been there.<br>  <br>  I think only a taxi.<br>  <br>  Get the price before engaging one.  Be certain that you understand the price, in ￡ or $, not in Lire, unless you have converted money to lire and understand the exchange.<br>  <br>  Often they will charge more and argue that you didn't understand the price.  Most do speak English.<br>  If you go to Venice, be careful of overcharges.  Use the Vaporetto, (public transportation boats).  Gondolas are expensive.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that porters charge per bag, and airlines charge for extra weight.  It can be a hassle.

Those are the only official, licenced taxis in Rome and what they can charge is set by law. Even if you ask the hotel you're staying at to arrange a cab, I strongly urge you to get in the car that arrives only if the cab is one that looks like I've just described. Using anything else is an invitation to get ripped off or taken advantage of in some other way.<br>  <br>  There are lots more people working as unofficial taxi drivers who target tourists and they're scam artists at best, outright thieves at worst and definitely not the sort of person you want to be driving you around in an unfamiliar city in the early hours of the morning when you have to get some place by a certain time.<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way, eji, Italy almost certainly used the Lire when your father lived here, but the only legal tender in Italy since 1 January 2002 (i.e. for more than seven years now) has been the Euro.|`|OY87iLv1aa	On the Terravision web site for Rome-Ciampino it say's the office/cafe at Termini station is open at 3.30am to get a ticket and the times of the buses link with flights. <br>  mailto:ciampino@terravision.eu   or +39064880086 - +390679341722 - +390679494572 <br>  If you are in Rome you can check it out before the date you go.|`|a9jMOJeHaa	u can be there 1 hr before cause ciampino airport is not big like fiumicino..actually is small.your flight is that early that the first bus from city center start 15 minutes to 5am...too late .best way to take taxi...actually just private car cause taxi will charge u more...depending on traffic or similar..usually they take the longest way so they can make more money.the private car we know as NCC they have fix price that are not going to change on traffic or similar.u can find lot of company online.usually i ride with "pegaso limousine service" <a href="http://www.limousinepegaso.eu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.limousinepegaso.eu/</a>    dont put to much attention at the word limousine is more cheap than taxi|`|ue2OH0euaa	I would email Terravision, because their opening times are from 3.30am-7.30pm so i am presuming that they leave that early.

TcgUVcYwaa	Depends where you are going. <br>  <br>  You need to draw up a rough initiary and compare the point-to-point ticket costs to the total cost of the interrail pass, including the supplements for the sleeper trains and the reservation fees. <br>  <br>  One tool that can help you with this is www.jizdenka.cz. Note though that you should compare not just the regular train fares with the pass, but also look at the price of special offers for travelling on train (think buy in advance over the internet-specials) as well as bus and plane tickets. <br>  <br>  See <br>  www.whichbudget.com<br>  www.skyscanner.net<br>  www.eurolines.com<br>  <br>  Essentially you need to research on the cheapest ways to get from A to B for all the legs of your journey, then add everything together - and see how it fares against the Interrail pass. <br>  <br>  As a rule of thumb the Interrail One Month Global Youth Pass for 399 EUR /385 GBP will be worth it if you end up travelling at least 2 hours by train each day. This is because if you divide 399 EUR through 30 travel days you end up paying roughly 14 EUR per day. Depending upon the country an hour of travelling by train costs between 5 and 15 EUR in continental Europe.|`|91ee9ecef874dbd7f2fbe01d406b8560aa	I haven't gone yet, but I do have a global I'm using in May.<br>  I am planning to stay the whole month. I'm going to several countries. In fact, I plan to take the night trains instead of a hotel/etc. Yes, I will have to pay a supplement on top of my pass, but it's still good value. <br>  You should compare the different types of passes to the trip you want to take. You should also check the non-pass price of the tickets to see if you are getting the value you want.
5cce7ccee87e2efd0bc574dc8b3a7312aa	Sadly at the moment, the yen to pound rate is not good for coming over here! Though by next year, it may be better.<br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest you avoid the summer here if possible, as it's very hot and horribly humid! Personally, I'm a fan of warm/hot weather, but the humidity is terrible. I would say the best times (weather wise) to visit are April/May and late Sep-early Nov. The temperatures are usually warm then, but not too hot, and not humid.<br>  <br>  The only 'simple' way to come to Japan would be a package tour, but I wouldn't recommend them, as you're not free to explore what you want!<br>  <br>  I suggest you research places you'd like to go, and plan an itinerary from there. Travel within Japan isn't exactly cheap, but the train system is very good.<br>  <br>  The Lonely Planet Japan book is very good, I've found it very helpful.<br>  <br>  Places I can recommend:<br>  Nara (I much preferred it to Kyoto, though you'll probably want to drop by there too)<br>  Hida Takayama (a nice traditional town)<br>  Nagano Prefecture is beautiful. If you're interested in Monkies, Yudanaka with the wild monkey park is well worth a visit.<br>  Hokkaido is also lovely, but flights there are pricey! I visited Shikotsu-ko and had a great time (Hokkaido's weather is much nicer in the summer than the rest of Japan!)|`|I3CNklLKaa	I've never had a Yen to go there myself.|`|zAA5CqsMaa	I can really recommend going through this person <a href="http://www.solloway.org/main.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.solloway.org/main.html</a><br>  I went last Autumn and it was really good- I stayed there for a few months, but she showed a group of us around for a few weeks first and it was great, and as she knows it all so well she takes you straight from place to place fitting in more than I ever would have been able to by myself.<br>  Great way to see a variety of Japan, and see and experience more than you would as a foreign tourist by yourself.|`|319Fty6Waa	I am Japanese.

But first question is, who are you booking it through?  If it's through a 3rd party such as vegas.com, hotels.com, expedia, etc.. You are always prepaying and it's generally non-refundable.  If you are booking directly through Palazzo via their website, it's generally first night's rate + tax charged to your card refundable with a 72 hour cancellation.  However, if you are booking a promotional package through Palazzo read the fine print.  Sometimes it's no different and sometimes you are prepaying the entire stay and it's refundable with a 72 hour cancellation.  At times it may also be non refundable.|`|fuD3lgIjaa	I suggest you contact customer service on this one!!  Every hotel has different policies!!

By the way, it's 7 years from the time it's paid up, too, so if it takes you 3 years to pay it off, it will be on your record for 10.<br>  <br>  Most creditors, though, will take into account any 'goodwill' efforts made.  So if you skipped on paying for a while, but then paid well over the minimum payments, they will take that into account.<br>  <br>  That said, given the economic situation we're in, creditors will not be as likely to hand out credit to anyone, now, so you might have a really hard time getting any credit for a few years.

The Arabs occupying Gaza should thank Israel for attempting to restore justice to that part of the world. As to what you claim to have done for Israel, that is as credible as me stating that I am an emissary for His Holiness, The Pope. You should be ashamed of yourself (whether you are actually Jewish or not - it does not matter as both Jews and non-Jews should feel shame when they sin) for comparing the Israeli Army to Nazis. You may know zero about The Holocaust (I can suggest some reading material so you can become educated about that dark night in history), but those of us who do know about it resent you cheapening the memory of the six million Jews and seven million non-Jews who were murdered in the death camps run by the Nazis, Poles, Latvians and Arabs/Moslems while people like you pretended it wasn't happening.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	No Jew would ever ask such an insidious question, but why is no one surprised that you did? You have consistently sided with Israel's enemies and now, just like Israel's enemies, you want to compare this situation to the Holocaust? That is beyond disgusting!! <br>  <br>  No person in their right mind would not see that the Jewish people did NOTHING to warrant what Hitler did to them. <br>  <br>  No person who ever actually stood in defense of Israel would not be able to see that the GazaNazi's (Hamas) brought this war on their own people and then hid behind them. That has been proven over and over again. No one likes it that innocent people and children died, but just like the rest of Israel's enemies, YOU refuse to acknowledge the truth about who is responsible and want to BLAME ISRAEL. <br>  <br>  You are the one without credibility and I have serious doubts that you have ever served a day in defense of Israel or that you would hunt down and kill anyone, unless it was a member of the Israeli government. <br>  <br>  What a sad little man you must be.<br>  <br>  - - - <br>  “We can forgive them for sending rockets into our cities. We can forgive them for killing our people. But we cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children. We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us” -  Golda Meir<br>  <br>  It's the Arabs that need to ask Israel for their forgiveness. Think on that for a while.|`|lCW3Worpaa	Well, it's not over yet.<br>  <br>  Don't know if you've read the Jan 26th issue of The American Conservative but it has some excellent articles about the implications of Israel's attack on Gaza.  I think you'd find them thought provoking.<br>  <br>  Btw, better be careful thinking for yourself and not towing the line.  Annt has called you a 'play Jew' - can the laughable 'self-hating' be far behind?<br>  <br>  ADD- Truth, you are WAY outta line here.  If you allowed emails I would have chewed you out privately.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Not even a slight moral equivalence exists.<br>  The "Palestinians" select all of the Israeli's targets. Whenever they need a break to reload, they need only put-on a pretense of more concern for their children than for killing Jews and Israel goes along with it.<br>  It's very unfortunate that the "Palestinians" are willing to paint bulls-eyes on their children.

But just as that American anger didn't justify anything and everything that followed, the fact that there are indefensible attacks on Israeli civilians doesn't render the (FAR MORE LETHAL) attacks on Gaza...<br>  <br>  More to the point: for those who insist that others put themselves in the position of a resident of Sderot -- as though that will, by itself, prove the justifiability of the Israeli attack -- the idea literally never occurs to them that they ought to imagine what it's like to live under foreign occupation for 4 decades (and, despite the 2005 "withdrawal from Gaza," Israel continues to occupy and expand its settlements on Palestinian land and to control and severely restrict many key aspects of Gazan life). No thought is given to what it is like, what emotions it generates, what horrible acts start to appear justifiable, when you have a hostile foreign army control your borders and airspace and internal affairs for 40 years, one which builds walls around you, imposes the most intensely humiliating conditions on your daily life, blockades your land so that you're barred from exiting and prevented from accessing basic nutrition and medical needs for your children to the point where a substantial portion of the underage population suffers from stunted growth.<br>  <br>  So extreme is their emotional identification with one side (Israel) that it literally never occurs to them to give any thought to any of that, to imagine what it's like to live in those circumstances.<br>  <br>  Still, there is a substantial difference between, on the one hand, basically well-intentioned people who are guilty of excessive emotional and cultural identification with one side of the dispute and, on the other, those who adopt the psychopathic derangement of belittling rage over widespread civilian deaths as mere "whining" or even something to view as a strategic asset. The latter group is a subset of war supporters and evinces every defining attribute of the Terrorist.<br>  <br>  If you see Palestinians as something less than civilized human beings: as "barbarians" -- just as if you see Americans as infidels warring with God or Jews as sub-human rats -- then it naturally follows that civilian deaths are irrelevant, perhaps even something to cheer. For people who think that way, arguments about "proportionality" won't even begin to resonate -- such concepts can't even be understood -- because the core premise, that excessive civilian deaths are horrible and should be avoided at all costs, isn't accepted. Why should a superior, civilized, peaceful society allow the welfare of violent, hateful barbarians to interfere with its objectives? How can the deaths or suffering of thousands of barbarians ever be weighed against the death of even a single civilized person?<br>  <br>  It's much easier to undervalue the suffering imposed on The Other when you don't have to see it...<br>  <br>  -Glenn Greenwald <br>  <br>  <br>  We can forgive but we cannot forget. Ariah you are on the right track brother. god bless you and all your jewish kind .|`|wVNwoEfCaa	Arieh,<br>  You are a kind and compassionate person who does not believe in revenge, who doesn't believe that killing children and innocents is ok under any circumstances.  Sadly, among these oh so high and mighty Zionists, you are in the minority, in fact you are an unheard of entity.  These people are rigid and unmoving in the extreme.  Forgiveness and compassion is not in their vocabularies, and for those of us who do have it, we are considered the ones in the wrong.  Oddly, the Jews who have this trait, and the non-Jews who support Palestine are considered by these people to be either traitors or supporters of terrorism.  Because it is such a foreign notion to them, they can not wrap their minds around the fact that some people are just Humanists.  That we have love and compassion for the innocent and those treated unjustly.  It threatens everything they believe in, that is why they believe in war, not in diplomacy.  <br>  It is a shame, but the Fundamentalist Christians, and the militant Zionists are the worst offenders in this respect.  I am reading a book called Have a Nice Dooms Day by Nicholas Guyatt.  What an eye opener it is.  It explains a lot of attitudes in this forum.<br>  Don't listen to what anyone says Arieh, because I believe you have done more for Israel than anyone on here.  Not only do you fight for what you think is right, and done your time in the IDF, but you also have given the face of compassion to what many see as a hard hearted people, especially in these times.  But because you stand out in this respect, you are called traitor and self hating Jew.  Well, take this as a compliment, because that is the name they reserve for anyone who isn't willing to kill anyone who gets in Israels way, innocent or not, baby, child, old person, whatever.  All are expendable as far as those extremists are concerned.  You should thank God you are not counted among them.<br>  @Teresa.....you quoted this:   But we cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children. We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us” - Golda Meir<br>  This was a threat, here is the translation of what she actually MEANT (as they say, actions speak louder than words):  Be prepared, we are willing to kill every last one of your children.  But, if you love them more than fighting for your rights and freedoms, we will stop murdering them in cold blood.  But if you continue to struggle, ........well, I think we have seen by Gaza exactly what happens when they continue to struggle.  As I have already seen on this board, people who are sick and rigidly pro-Zionist have no problem with the innocents being killed, as long as the Palestinians fight for justice.  I think we can all see who is the sick one, and it isn't Arieh.|`|eyJqrqn7aa	Not once have you made me think you have ever done anything for Israel or anyone else in your short unlearned life.<br>  A great Jew once said the poor would always be among us but his time was short.<br>  Same thing.

It happens in all Arab nations, Jew move in, buy land and start business.<br>  <br>  There should have been a better solution besides just buying the land out from under the Palestinians and running them into a corner, then putting a wall around them. Then separating them from Jews, cause discrimination.<br>  <br>  I am for Israel and Palestine to be free as one nation, not as separate, because the Palestinians where born their for hundreds of years.<br>  <br>  This could have been different, if it was dealt with fairly.

Whilst there is an unending, absurd obsession with the Nazis - constant references being made in nearly every Jewish influenced movie, book, TV programme.

UIJorsD7aa	Like other forms of anti-Semitism, left-wing anti-Semitism has survived by mutating; whereas once the Jewish question (or problem) was viewed through the prism of economics, now it belongs to the realm of politics. The orthodox Marxist notion2 that the Jews - as an economic agent - perform a distinctive function within a system designed for the extraction of surplus value has been replaced by the anticolonialist notion that the Jews - as a national collective - are integral to the maintenance of American hegemony on a global level.3 Accordingly, there has been a conceptual shift on the Left from the politics of class to the politics of identity; and, again accordingly, a practical alignment with those forces, most notably the Islamist movements, opposed to this hegemony.<br>  <br>  As a result of this alignment, three points warrant consideration. First, visceral opposition not to Israel's security policies alone but to its very legitimacy means that, as in Islamist discourse, the terms "Jew," "Israel," and "Zionist" are increasingly interchangeable in contemporary left-wing discourse; second, this discourse has been standardized and globalized;4 third, this discourse is increasingly finding recognition outside the activist margins, for example, among politicians broadly described as "progressive," among prominent academics, and in liberal media outlets.<br>  <br>  In the United Kingdom, the phenomenon of left-wing anti-Semitism has been somewhat overshadowed by the attention paid to similar problems elsewhere in Europe, particularly in France, Belgium, and The Netherlands. Nevertheless, the anti-Semitism of the British Left deserves closer examination, not least because Britain was the former Mandate power in Palestine and a Labour government was in office when the State of Israel was created in 1948. The aim of this article, therefore, is to take a long view of the development of anti-Semitism on the British Left. While much of the analysis concentrates on attitudes toward Zionism, it needs to be stressed that in the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, hostility toward Zionism and Israel often functions as a Trojan horse for anti-Semitism.|`|i7oHTo9haa	I say let the show go on and you can donate to me your 5 quid. :)  I approve freedom of speech and especially when it is done by artists and accept all donations!  I like freedom of speech because it "outs" who is the extremist and who is the peaceful person so we can deal with them more effectively.<br>  <br>  I like protests but ONLY peaceful protest. The moment it turns violent or unruly or chaotic, that thoroughly repulses me. That is what civilized peoples and societies do, people get to object.  Just because we voice our opinion, does not make it bad.  It is how the opinion is expressed.  So, I will express my opinion on this Seven Children play:<br>  <br>  Dear Britain:<br>  <br>  I happen to think there is double standard. One can't show a Fitna film about Muslims but one can show an antisemitic play about Jews? What's up with that?<br>  <br>  The threat of violence from 10,000 extremist British Muslims quieted Wilders' Fitna showing in Britain<br>  <br>  So what do Jews do? We write a letter and sign it and make people think about their actions and the show goes on.<br>  <br>  Britain, I'm trying really hard to not give up on our allies here. I keep telling myself that America and Britain are sisters thru thick and thin we have such a deep history together. We're currently fighting an Afganistan terror campaign, so what's up with the internal issues? I shake my head when I remember another matter that Jewish peaceful protests get blocked off from society because the Muslims there will go crazy about it and start a ruckus (understatement,) hence nullifying the point of a public protest by Jews, it is no longer public but private, as the Muslims silenced our voice. And, while the protest is going on the Muslims shoot rockets anyways and the police are totally nonchalant about it. So what gives?<br>  <br>  FFS, please let the Fitna guy into Britain and let both the shows go on. If anyone acts up then arrest them and handle the extremists before the situation gets worse. Do not push the problem under the rug. The threat of 10,000 Muslims silenced Britain and Geert Wilders but Britain has what, 1-2 mil Muslims now? Europe has 55million Muslims what will happen next when they don't like something else, what will they do and what will you do? Are they going to do a burning riot in London like they did in Paris?

Plymouth could have become just another Twin Cities suburb, but more than 50,000 jobs keep residents working there. <br>  Home prices are within reason: The typical three-bedroom, two-bath house goes for $350,000. The city's main school district is ranked among the top three in the state, and for culture, Plymouth's open-air amphitheater, the Hilde Performance Center, hosts numerous summer concerts. Residents are a quick drive from the Mall of America, the nation's biggest mall. <br>  <br>  And did we mention the outdoors? Plymouth boasts more than half a dozen sizable bodies of water. Of course, this being Minnesota, winter can be brutal: January's average low temperature is about 13°F. But when the mercury plummets, the locals get busy. In February the city hosts a Fire & Ice Festival that includes mini-golf, bowling and basketball - all right on the ice.
PA0bGBtCaa	British Airways uses both the 777-200 and their 747-400 to go from LHR-IAH. I live in Houston near IAH and see the BA planes flying overhead quite a bit.<br>  <br>  It depends on their fleet for that day on which plane you will get for the flight.

AA10523012	Please do not be offended by asking what kind of teacher you are when asking about the difference between UAE and Dubai. Therefore I assume you do not belong to the nationalities who are able to obtain a visa up on arrival. In this case, if you are able to land a job, you have to leave the UAE for 30 daysand re enter on an employment visa. <br>  <br>  It is highly advised to look for a suitable job online und enter the UAE on the proper entry permit (employment visa) if you want to work.<br>  <br>  You asked the same question regarding Singapore, Japan and Thailand. If you as a teacher not western educated, your salary in Dubai or the UAE general will be low. Don't know about a teacher's salary in Singapore or Thailand, but living costs over there are much cheaper. Just something to think about.<br>  <br>  Take care and all the best.|`|LCpJ0Z1Haa	Entering Dubai in order to find work once you're there can be problematic although several people have done it.<br>  <br>  There are two types of general visas, the tourist visa - issued on arrival to certain passport holders (see website below for a list) and good for about 30 days, and the visit visa - good for a longer period of time and generally issued before the visitor has reached the UAE.<br>  <br>  Getting a work visa usually comes with a contract from a company or school in your case.  Generally this will be included in your work package.  Changing over your visa will be handled by the company that hires you, they are the main focus of your efforts.<br>  <br>  Getting a company to help with the visa will be your best bet.  Getting a visa from a company before you set out to the UAE would be even better.<br>  <br>  PS Dubai is a part of the UAE so getting a visa (visit or tourist) will be good for both Dubai and the rest of the country.<br>  <br>  "Cheap" and Dubai aren't too words that usually go together, however affordable hotels can sometimes be found.  Try Kayak or Expedia.<br>  <br>  Check website below for more info on Dubai and the UAE.|`|NUsq2WtAaa	if you came here as Visit visa, you have to rush in securing a job, coz you are time bounded. Once you got one, the company will apply you an employment visa. Once your "E" visa is released, your employer will take your original passport and do the exemption at DNRD (IMMIGRATION). That allows you to stay in UAE, means you dont need to go out.

VEi3R0craa	If you go several blocks north of the convention center you may find something my husband bartends there on the weekend and that is what he does but they are very far in between and sometimes he can be parking 5 or more blocks away.

4sh2oRR7aa	I've heard about this too. Incest in Japanese families used to be extremely high and still is in rural areas. However while it does happen in cities, it's not commonly reported because people either 1. See nothing wrong with it or 2. If they've been raised on Western influence, they see it as wrong and will receive unneeded attention for it and the Japanese are all about blending in more than standing out. The incest rate between mothers/sons I think is the highest in the world in Japan or at least in the top 5 countries. One thing I read about on it that affairs are common in marriage (for husbands to go out and entertain themselves with younger women) so the son really has no competition from his father's interference.<br>  <br>  Here's a link on studies.

Risa is right that this one spread outside of Japan because of a Mainichi column.  The Mainichi column didn't make up these stories itself; it found crazy stories in Japanese tabloids (the equivalent of the National Enquirer) and translated them into English.  It was presented only as humour, not fact, but of course it spread around the internet and some people took it seriously.  Because you can write *anything* about Japan and some people will believe it.|`|dbAWPWzraa	That is really wrong.

kMK9E2a7aa	I think you are referring to API (Advanced passenger information). Depending on the airport you are flying out of the UK, if it's a big one like Gatwick or Manchester, Monarch Airlines get that information from your passport at the check-in desk. If you check in online, then you would need to fill that out online. Most carriers when you book online, have a section where you fill out an online form. They need your passport number, date of birth, sometimes place of birth and your citizenship. It's nothing to get worried about, it's quite simple.

Personally Manchester & Liverpool would hold no interest to me as I don't think they're too pretty either.  Aren't all those cities industrial, apart from Edinburgh?  I'm from New Zealand & this is what I know even from this side of the world & I've only ever been to London in the UK & that's it.|`|AjEftvtaaa	ermm it does!!<br>  <br>  Glasgow is now the second most visited destination in the UK, only London gets more visitors than Glasgow.<br>  <br>  Glasgow now also has the highest number of hotel rooms in the UK outside London and a further 6,000 hotel rooms will be added to Glasgow in the next two years, including the UK's first Six Star Hotel.<br>  <br>  To a previous poster; get your facts right, Glasgow has NEVER been the murder capital of Europe, go check the FACTS and not just believe what the papers say. This is bullshit the Scotsman (an Edinburgh paper) drempt-up over night when they realised Glasgow was over taking Edinburgh as Scotland's number one tourist destination.<br>  <br>  I think you will find the murder capital of Europe is a city in Finland, and in the UK, London, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool and Belfast all had more murders in 2008 than Glasgow did.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Its got nothing to do with castles, don't be reticules. Where is the castle in New York, Sydney, Barcelona, Madrid etc. They don't have castles. A castle doesn't make a city a great tourist destination.|`|YwdFUCQtaa	Because it's close to Edinburgh and suffers by comparison. If I was doing a tour of Britain on a limited timescale or budget and could only visit one Scottish city, it would be Edinburgh. More history, more historically significant buildings, more dramatic townscape, more walkable. Plus, deserved or not, Glasgow has a rough reputation, and the City Council has been busy destroying the architectural heritage of the city for long enough to make a big difference. In any civilised city, Alexander 'Greek' Thompson would be revered as a hero, his buildings preserved and used to promote the city's image. What have we got in Glasgow? Of his three major and most important churches, just one remains, and that as a ruined shell. This is rather like London losing all of its Wren churches except for the shell of St. Paul's. Sorry, but you look like a load of Philistines, led by idiots. Not an attractive image.|`|dgRTkccBaa	I think one of the main reasons is that it doesn't have a castle.  Tourists love castles.  The other reason is because of the reputation as a 'rough' city that Glasgow has had in the past discourages many people from going there.  Personally, i think it's one of the most interesting cities I've ever been to and love going back any chance I get.  I've also visited Edinburgh and I prefer Glasgow by far.|`|NePxlTnZaa	Liverpool and Manchester are both industrial cities so it probably isn't that.<br>  <br>  Liverpool also has/had a bit of a reputation for scally criminality but it also has lots history too.<br>  <br>  I've visited both Glasgow and Edinburgh and I have to say from the point of view of a visitor, Edinburgh, on the face of it, has much more to see and is a more attractive city centre.<br>  <br>  Glasgow also has a reputation for violence that goes before it and maybe that has something to do with it.|`|lKqBztk6aa	Not the 3rd largest metropolitan population at all; Greater London, West Midlands, Greater Manchester and Leeds City Region are all significantly larger.<br>  <br>  Look at the location of these compared to Glasgow. Leeds City Region gets more tourists than any metropolitan area; yes, it has York/Harrogate/The Dales, but notice it is 2 hours from London at a cheaper price than Glasgow.<br>  <br>  It is expensive to get to Glasgow and it is far away. Most people are nearer to London than Glasgow- and really as a destination, London is more popular. It doesn't make financial sense to go to Glasgow.|`|WcMxrfYRaa	I'm from Edinburgh and I love going across to Glasgow.<br>  Its fine in the city centre and west end and I love going down Great Western Road and round the University area.<br>  <br>  The Glaswegians are generally a very friendly bunch and have a great sense of humour. Its also more cosmopolitan than Edinburgh and is better for live music.<br>  <br>  It obviously had an image problem in the past but I think its certainly worth a visit.|`|cnPKAlDYaa	Having spent 10 enjoyable years in Glasgow when it was still "rough"...<br>  .."the sawdust and spit" pubs I knew are now all trendy bistro's and wine bars...<br>  <br>  I agree far more to see & do in Glasgow than Manchester or Liverpool (once you've got past the Beatles, what else is there ?).<br>  <br>  To be honest I think it's the accent ....people really struggle to understand it and find the way it is used, "threatening"...fluent in "Parliamo Glesga" myself so I find it part of the attraction, but....<br>  <br>  While since I lived there Katie..still got alot of long term friends in the area, so I visit fairly often.<br>  <br>  Have dropped anchor all over the UK, at sometime or the other, ..not sure that I consider myself to be "from" anywhere in particular...although I do avoid the shark infested southern waters|`|cTYhnumDaa	I go to Glasgow shopping sometimes and there isn't really anything historical that i'm aware of that would draw tourists since they are here for history most of the time.<br>  <br>  For example, even though Stirling is kinda small there is still lot's of tourists because of the Wallace Monument, Stirling castle and the Old town Jail and such.<br>  <br>  You never know though, they might make a trip to glasgow for shopping and clubbing :]<br>  <br>  and as someone else says its better for music.

A fantasy world of extravagant sets and hi-tech equipment, this is the most popular shooting site for the Tamil film industry.<br>  <br>  Muttukaadu:<br>  Situated 36 kilometres away from Chennai on the ECR road, Muttukadu is a famous tourist/outing spot. The place is famous for its backwater sports activities like boating and windsurfing (during the month of February) conducted by the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC) during particular times of the year. The Muttukadu Boat House comes up with various training camps and competitions for the crazy water sport lovers. It is an ideal picnic spot for all age groups to stop and take a look at the serene green surroundings and the blue stretch of water.<br>  <br>  Dhakshinachithra:<br>  The art village of Tamil Nadu with its rich cultural heritage is the Dhakshinachithra. This is located near Muttukadu on the way to Mahabalipuram. Founded by the Madras Craft Foundation, Dhakshinachithra is famous for its models of traditional handlooms and houses of the 4 south Indian states. There are often live demonstrations of various skills of weaving, pot making, etc. This age old art village represents the cultural heritage and traditions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.<br>  <br>  Mudaliar kuppam:<br>  Another small village known for its calm and picturesque surroundings with backwaters and sand dunes.

Mudaliarkuppam is located in the district of Kanchipuram, 92 km from Chennai and 36 km down Mamallapuram on ECR (East Coast Road). Mudaliarkuppam is an incredible tourist destination. Tourism industry in the idyllic place is growing by leaps and bounds. Visitors and tourists visit this place alike, to while away their time on the choicest array of rowboats, pedal boats and motorboats. The Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation undertakes and preserves this unusual boating house. In fact, Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation came up with new ideas and policies to make it even more attractive. Recently, they have launched a special boat riding facility at its Raindrop Boat House in Mudaliarkuppam. It is called kayak, the one-seater boat. At present there are fifty-four varieties of boats. The purchases include two-seaters pedalling boats, speedboats, motorboats and one-seater pedal boats. Special boat races are organised every year. College and university students participate here in great enthusiasm and unison. There is an island approximately 4 km from the Raindrop Boat House, in the expanse of the waters in Mudaliarkuppam. Tourists are allowed to spend some time in the island and tents are available for this purpose. Unfortunately, there is no decent place to have one`s food in Mudaliarkuppam. The best-available solution is to carry food from Chennai or any other decent place along the way. In order to enjoy the famed boating bonanza, tourists need to pay a specific amount of money, depending on the type of boat and duration of time. At present, it is recorded that Mudaliarkuppam attracts an approximate decent crowd of one thousand and five hundred tourists on Sundays and other holidays. Also eight hundred to one thousand tourists attract tourists on Saturdays.|`|Ztf6BqwSaa	Mudaliarkuppam is the awesome place for boating locating in between chennai and pondicherry (ECR ROAD) even you can enjoy boating in muttukadu on the way to mudaliyarkuppam.|`|583ejbTHaa	mudaliarkuppam is near marakkanam about 75 km from chennai where you have a boat house like muttukadu but you can not stay there you have to stay in mahabs  or pondy

Are you worried that they'll look better than you?|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Allot of people who have speech problems are taught to speak in a proper english accent as it requires the pronunciation of every syllable in very word clearly.

This is a good start. It also helps to be around other people who are english as you can eventually mimic their accents.

mx32BnQAaa	Summer in Crete begins in June. The period June to September sees almost no rainfall and average <br>  temperatures of around 25 oC. Daytime temperature in mid summer is often in the low 30s, though can sometimes reach up to 40 oC. Summer 2002 saw the mercury rise to a stifling 45 oC. June guarantees to get good weather in Crete. The sea is warmer, there are still a lot of flowers, not too many tourists. It is maybe the best time of the year to visit Crete, especially if you intend to hike as the weather in June isn't too hot yet. Best time to sit at the beach, swim and play. Refreshing sea breezes. Always remember your sunscreen and hat, sit in the shade and take plenty of fluids. Perhaps take a day to head inland to the mountain Cretan villages – always an excellent choice with breathtaking views. Crete's outdoor life is just beginning but bring a sweater, it can still be cool in the evenings~|`|KFagjt8Jaa	The period June to September sees almost no rainfall and average temperatures of around 25 oC.

If this relates to theatre, there are five in Torbay, the Princess Theatre at Torquay, the Palace Theatre at Paignton, the Babbacombe Theatre at Babbacombe, and the Little Theatre in Torquay, and the Brixham Theatre at Brixham. Suggest you Google each Theatre to see what programme is being offered.<br>  Having Googled him, I don't think Torquay is quite ready for him, especially in relation to the under-18s. It seems more likely he will perform at a club. Suggest you Google his name with various combinations, like gigs, and see if you can find out from his blogs.

Most of the poverty is cause by having more people than jobs available.  The people that get affected the most have the least to begin with and so they have trouble getting to a place were they are stable enough to weather  even a temporary downturn in the economy.   A maid at a hotel makes about 4000-4500 per month.  That is not even a living wage.|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	Yes, there is definitely poverty in Bangkok, just as there is poverty in every major city in the world. Poverty exists because there is not enough economic opportunity for all people to flourish. I'm sure someone will point out that lack of motivation by some people results in their personal poverty, and that's true. But the key element is opportunity, as many people who have lost their jobs in America are learning now. Though all may desire to work, dwindling opportunities will lead to poverty for some.|`|9e3125f1cbec258838efea7ac306d1c1aa	There is a lot of poverty in Bangkok, but it isn't as severe as in some Asian cities like Mumbai.

I'm pretty sure that for this program, you don't need to have experience speaking Japanese. One downside of this program is that there is a good chance that you won't get to choose where in Japan you are sent. I know a girl who did JET. She asked to be put in a big city, and she ended up in a rural area. She had a great time anyways though. A plus is that Japan is an awesome country, and a great place to live for a couple years. If you're interested, you should definitely google it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

JJfn4J2kaa	Hi Nick,<br>  I own a house in Cala Dor and regularly drive from the airport. If your car rental is at the airport, you merely leave the airport and follow the signs for Santanyi - do be careful - at one point you have to make sure that you dont miss the slipway that you need to take a left exit from - its quite soon after you leave the airport complex. There is a new fast road most of the way from the airport to Cala Dor, and you bypass all of the main towns such as Llucmajor and Campos. Driving is relatively ok - its not as crazy as New York or even places like the South of France and Italy. Around Cala Dor its really easy but if you go into Palma you do need take extra care. If you want to travel around the island to places like Soller, you go to Palma and take the Via Centura, the ring road. You need to take extra care when leaving and joining fast busy roads such as this. Some of the roads on the North and West of the island are a bit scary - narrow and twisty -but with really amazing views. Overall I think you will have no problems - hopefully we dont bump into each other  literally as I will be there in April too. The roads will not be too busy as it isnt the peak of the tourist season.<br>  Hope you like Cala Dor and Mallorca as much as I do!|`|tQsxsuNPaa	It's not England.  They drive on the right side of the road, too.<br>  <br>  No, not compared to New York city...you'll be fine.  Of course, one begs the question WHY BOTHER RENTING A CAR????!  You probably will find that it is much more expensive to park, and to drive it than it is worth!  I wouldn't even bother...just take a cab to the hotel and use public transportation.  Much simpler!|`|kMK9E2a7aa	It's okay to drive in Spain. Mallorca is easy compared to the mainland. I actually find the standard of driving here no worse than anywhere else. There is less aggression on the roads compared to the UK. Having said that, driving in big cities is very daunting if you are not used to it.|`|5RZxhiNCaa	I wouldn't say it is difficult. I never had bigger problems there. But there are some bad drivers out there who drive very strange on the highway/motorway.<br>  <br>  In the city centre of Palma it's often not easy to get a parking space. But no problems in the other towns.<br>  <br>  And obey the traffic signs, especially as a foreigner. I am unlucky, there seems to be always a police man hiding nearby when I don't completely stop at a Stop sign. ;-)<br>  <br>  I am more afraid of being run over by a drunken driver when I cross the street in a tourist area.|`|UZcUIfwIaa	If you're used to driving on the right you won't notice the difference. went there last year and I'm used to driving on the left in UK. It wasn't a problem. Just watch out for roundabouts, I know you guys don't have many over there. Great Island.......so much to see.Make sure you get away from the tourist traps.

Y47WgY4Laa	￡2000 is plenty - there a lot of people living in London who survive on a lot less.<br>  <br>  As you're already aware, most of your monthly budget will go on rent so do a bit of research into prices / areas before you commit to a flat. Work out where your course will be held (which campus) and check out the surrounding areas.<br>  <br>  You can search for flats and get an idea of rental prices on www.gumtree.com - but remember to check if bills are included or not. ￡1000-￡1250 a month should pay for a pretty decent flat in a safe area.<br>  <br>  Like most big cities, London is expensive but it is completely possible to live frugally without missing out. If you know where to look, you can find some real bargains on food, every-day purchases, cinema tickets, clothes, etc.<br>  <br>  Oh and get an Oyster card - it will save you some cash on transport.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with your Masters!|`|tFoSy2YRaa	If you're a student you don't pay tax...I don't think.<br>  I'm an undergrad in London and I don't see how anybody could live here for less than ￡6000 for the academic year excluding tuitions fees.|`|GR0G3uYbaa	Thats ok for a month rent council tax water ￡1100, gas leccy phone ￡100, shopping ￡200, transport buses etc ￡100, clothes an absolute fortune any nights out a fortune!!!
AA10535892	there is one thing I can guarantee you, it is the UK embassy you have to apply to and deal with (even if it happens to be Thai staff working there), all the paper work is going to be in english, if you do not understand it why would a local thai person agent or not understand it better than you, forget the agent DO IT YOURSELF get all the required forms and information read it all read it again (you need a different set of forms for each of you) and start filling in all the answers for both yourself and your wife, start collecting everything you need, get it all together along with your money that is to be paid for the application, check the check list make sure you have everything and go and submit the application with your wife/girlfriend. your local marriage ceremony only makes you married in the eyes of the local thai's this part is not recognisedd in the UK, to make it legal in the UK and else where again DO IT YOURSELF in bangkok, it is not hard but you do need about 4-5 business days in bangkok, get all the information in english (yes really) from the UK embassy in Bangkok, follow all the directions, get your statement to say you are single and legally allowed to marry get it translated into thai and certified at the thai foreign office, then have all your paperwork with you and both of you head to the local district office, your wife will even have to pop out in the middle of it all to have a pregnancy test around the corner at the local doctor (it's a thai thing I believe so you know exactly what situation you are getting into with no hidden surprises) not long after this point you will be legally married in the eyes of the UK and Thailand, after this get everything translated into english go to the thai forigen office at chang wattanna (again) and get it all legally certified ...(get 2 copies certified), (alternatively you submit your application for your wife to go to the UK with the intention that you will be legally getting married soon after arrival)<br>  all this is not hard, the main part is reading and understanding english do not take short cuts or think you will be ok with certain paperwork missing you won't! I met a guy in the embassy that told me it was his 3 trip and 3rd visit trying to get everything right which rather surprised me as it could not of been any more clearly written in english, I on the other hand had everything done in ten minutes and approved which surprised him even more.(yeah I know nobody likes a smart ****)<br>  you DO NOT need an agent, you DO NOT need a lawyer, you DO NEED TO BE ABLE TO READ, UNDERSTAND AND WRITE IN ENGLISH ! <br>  to give answers on all the paper work like name, address, when and where you met your girlfriend etc, people you can give as a reference in the uk etc these are all answers only you know so why would you pay someone else to write it for you!<br>  TOP TIP - get all the forms have a look and read them and you will understand what I mean<br>  Nothing secures a visa application until the visa is granted, you have to put the hard work into it at every point which is mainly time, in the interview process it is going to be your girlfriend that has to go for the interview not any agent you may have, but make yourself availiable! <br>  My wife and I applied for Australia but I know the UK and Australia are very similair, don't compare the USA or anywhere else for that matter. before we put our application in we went in to see a visa officer I had my list of questions relating to anything I was unsure of and I politely was not going to leave there until I had all my answers, be organised have everything ready and more for when they ask for it do your homework and think ahead. you'll be fine mate, good luck.|`|AA10368738	My advice for what its worth is to contact The British Consulate in the city near, or where you are in Thailand.

Check the American Embassy in Thailand website for information.  As for the UK I really don't understand what your doing.  If you plan to come here and marry why would you apply for a fiance visa (since your already married).  As for agencies doing the paper work for you, I think your going to find that you still need to provide tons and tons of information, photos, emails, receipts showing a real relationship between you and her.  Also financial records, all this is going to be done by you not the agent.  You need to take a day and get online and read all the rules and procedures you need to follow.  Pick a good law firm not some agency on some soi off Sukmitvit.  When some agency tell's you no problem getting a visa, that's when you start worrying.  Good Luck in whatever you decide to do.|`|910537da330152ad69b869eeff90d14eaa	not sure about the UK, but in the USA, any overseas marrige is viewed as not valid.

1cJjGNOBaa	All I can say is DON'T DO IT!!!! You'll wish you were dead! We went in July one year and it was truly awful- and I actually live in the south so I know about humidity! Go between November and March for the best weather.|`|3eRDHl4Saa	August is extremely hot. It is also hurricane season so expect daily rain, usually in the afternoon. It says warm when it rains, but it rains a lot! It's not too bad though; it shouldn't ruin any of your days at the parks. The rain storms usually last for only a half hour. As for crowds, it is definitely not peak season. If anything, the crowds are as minimal as they'll ever get. It's definitely a good time to go if you're looking to avoid big crowds. If you're not a big fan of humidity and hot weather, then I do not recommend August for visiting. If you don't mind it, then you'll be fine. I think high 80's is uncommon for November; it usually might be in the 70's. In August, it ranges from high 70's to high 90's (I love the warm weather. The warmer the better!). Bring shorts and tank tops. You'll need them.<br>  <br>  The good thing about Disney in August is that they really know how to cool you down. All indoor rides are air conditioned and there are misting machines in a few places. And don't forget refreshments! There's a ton of drink and ice cream stands around the parks. You can't visit Disney without enjoying at least one classic Premium Mickey Ice Cream Bar. They're delicious!<br>  <br>  So like I said, if you don't mind the hot weather, then you'll be fine. If you're concerned about the crowds, it's probably the best time to go. I recommend August. Hope this helps and have fun!|`|9NpXU7D2aa	you can expect it to be much hotter and more humid in august. <br>  average temps in august are 92 with many days reaching higher than that. <br>  (in late august of 2006 it was soooo hot that while walking around my sisters sandal actually broke cuz the glue that held it together melted. (yeah i know it was a cheap sandal but still) )<br>  and it rains nearly every afternoon (usually between 3-6pm) and the storms pass through quickly (usually 30-60 minutes) but of course there is the potential for it to rain ALL day long. <br>  <br>  and it will be quite crowded during that time. most states don't go back to school until after labor day. and for the last weekend of freedom for kids you can expect huge crowds. <br>  i can tell you that i would never go in the end of august again.|`|o0VyLaPiaa	August will be hot, humid, and crowded as heck!|`|Ukh1zQhbaa	We have been to Disney twice in August, last year we went for ten days. It was not crowded at all, but it rained a lot. We will be going again the year in August, and have booked the week before Labor Day. They gave us free dining for the week,and we could not pass up the deal.|`|cb5c699472c5114ed99da5404a38ca3faa	I've went in August before and it was miserable,terribly hot, and very humid. Went on a day when temps were in the 90's. We will never go in August again.|`|qog0Yd72aa	probably very hot.!<br>  But it shouldn't be that crowded, considering its not a school vacation, or a holiday or anything. and kids should be in school.I went during school vacation before and it was very bussyyyy, with tons of kids. But even if it is crowded and hot, its still really fun! i am going again during march for my sisters vaca from college. my school (middle school) is not on vacation, but my parents both think this would be a good time to go weatherwise, and i really dont think there will be a lot of crowds. So maybe you should consider going in march,have a great time!|`|VVSqTdaOaa	Aug will be even hot and humid and sticky temps in the 90s. If you really want to enjoy Disney with no crowds Jan and Feb is the best time to go. Just avoid Presidents day weekend.

54ee904ce0957cabc081644147eab797aa	I am a student at the University of Windsor, so I like to think I know a lot about the watering holes in Windsor. <br>  <br>  Our downtown strip on Ouelette Ave. has the most bars per capita than anywhere west of Montreal.  Check out the link I put in the sources section for a full list of bars.  Here are a few of my personal recommendations:<br>  <br>  - If you're looking for something a bit more upscale, Caesar's Windsor features the VU Bar, which has a beautiful view of the Detroit skyline, but the drink prices a very expensive.  Though if you get lucky on the gaming floor, I'm sure you'd be willing to splurge on some specialty drinks.<br>  <br>  - Saturday nights in downtown Windsor is party central, so I hope you're coming to visit during the weekend.  If you're looking for a place to have a few drinks with your buds, I'd go to places like:<br>  <br>  - Papa Cheney's<br>  - The Honest Lawyer<br>  - Pepper's<br>  - The Chubby Pickle<br>  - Lefty's Lounge<br>  <br>  But if you're with some lady friends, or want to hook up with some girls, you might want to scope out some dance bars downtown, places like:<br>  <br>  - The Boom Boom Room<br>  - Treehouse<br>  - The Room<br>  - 29 Park<br>  - The Beach<br>  <br>  Apart from the downtown core, you'll find a good selection of pub-style establishments, such as:<br>  <br>  - Spicoli's<br>  - Hurricane's<br>  - Rock Bottom<br>  - The Basement (on the campus of the University of Windsor)<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|6ubXXtZyaa	The BoomBoom room located in down town windsor

Uxmal and Chichen Itza would both be longer bus rides and more walking so they may not be good for you.<br>  <br>  You could also take a trip to Mérida. There is a lot of impressive colonial architecture there. You can tour the city on one of those double decker tour buses. The top is open if you want sun or if it's too hot you can sit below in the air conditioning. You can also tour the Centro and Paseo de Montejo in a horse-drawn carriage or calesa. The website below is a good one for general information on the area.<br>  <br>  There are also take a boat tour to see flamingos in Celestun, it's impresive and wouldn't be too much walking.

Houston's divided up into a few areas, but I don't know where they'd be written down. You could call a real estate agent, too.|`|EbsekS7yaa	Spring Branch|`|LCun3uwTaa	NW Houston, near 290. <br>  It's a Houston address.<br>  Good luck!<br>  One of my favorite restaurant is there.

You are in Northwest Houston, you get downtown by taking US 290 aka Northwest Freeway.|`|L16wLAhNaa	It's fairbanks, NW Houston, Jersey Village would work as well, although fairbanks is what it is probably really called.|`|bb78255d5b2fd694bb90a42bfb5eded1aa	yea u live pretty far i got some family up in Cypress ur like  like 30 minutes past downtown houston , i live in southhouston , u live in north houston
62deca1d37dad9f560583c21f5dd1721aa	You could try Yokusuka. That is a suburb of Yokohama.<br>  <br>  It seemed a bit cheaper then The greater Tokyo area.<br>  <br>  Give it a try.
lcj1AKt1aa	My rating will not be your rating. <br>  You only have to pay for sodas and alcohol on the ship.  <br>  Juice is free only at breakfast.  <br>  Food is also free. <br>  If you use the spa you will have to pay for the services.

URO3gDXcaa	why is this in travel?  and a new hampshire phone number.  don't list your number in public like this.  you may regret it.
pcHp7Dgkaa	No, there's nothing like those shops in Darwin.<br>  <br>  I think you may have a mistaken idea of what Darwin will be like if you're asking about smart clothes shops like Miss Selfridges or specialty stores like Sephora. Darwin may be a capital city, but it only has around 120,000 people and is located in the hot tropics. It isn't exactly a frontier town and has some nice places and reasonable shopping but it's essentially a very casual town - it's much too hot all year around to be anything else.|`|UWx1beYtaa	Sorry but there is nothing like that. How ever we are about to get a Harbour Town in the next few years. That will be the biggest thing to hit Darwin since Tracey.<br>  <br>  Darwin is about thongs, shorts and singlets. There are people who dress up all the time wearing make up but I really don't know how they do it. It sweats off as soon as you walk out the door.<br>  <br>  The biggest shopping centre we currently have is Casuarina which is located in the suburbs. You'll be shocked how small it is compaired to other cities.

AA10295001	I live in Cherokee County, GA and you'll have to go farther north before you get to gold pan.  Gold panning is done in the North Georgia Mountains were they dug many moons ago.<br>  <br>  I've done it in Dahlonega and it's so much fun.  It's about a 45 minute minute drive from here.|`|ewd9n2lRaa	I'm not aware of any place in Cherokee to go gold panning.  Your best bet is to drive up to Forsyth County, to Dahlonega to go gold panning.  There are some gold panning places up there.

km9cQNAXaa	Where from ??? No sensible answer without that.<br>  <br>  Best I can suggest is this.<br>  <br>  Right now your chances are somewhere between zero and poor. At present the UK has around 9% unemployed and the figure is still rising. Your skills are not in short supply so you will struggle to find a job. <br>  <br>  Right now it's not a great idea.<br>  <br>  Ian M
fj5nfuZTaa	I am not sure to which particular fast you refer, but in Judaism there are 7 fast days.<br>  <br>  1. Yom Kippur - The day of Atonement - the most important fast of entire Jewish calendar, and probably the only fast that directly commanded in written Torah. Occurs on Tishrey 10th (Jewish month of Tishrey is 7th month and roughly coinsides with September<br>  <br>  2 Tsom Gedaliya - Fast of Gedaliya occures on 3d of Tishrey (the same month as above). Gedaliya was the last Jewish King of biblical kingdom of Judea and on that day he was assasinated. In fact he really was assasinated on 1st or 2d of Tishrey during Jewish New year feast, but since Jews do not fast on moadim - specific times for holidays prescribed by Torah the fast was assigned to Tishrey 3d - the first day after holiday. This fast is not considered to be very important, and usually observed by only religeous Jews (vs Yom Kippur when nearly all Jews fast)<br>  <br>  3. Tevet 10th. - The day when nearly 2000 years ago Roman army surrounded Jerusalem - First fast in the cycle of 3 that relate to the same series of events. (This one usually falls on January) This fast is semi-important.<br>  <br>  4. Yud-Tet be Tamuz 19th ofTamuz - second fast in cycle of 3 - Roman army broke through the city wall of Jerusalem. This fast also starts 3 weeks of progressively increasing morning period with various prohibitations (such as listening to music attending joyful events etc) added on during this 3 week period. It usually falls on July. This fast is one of more important ones<br>  <br>  5. Tisha Be Av - 9th of Av - The most intense mourning fast of Jewish calendar. - Second important fast after Yom Kippur. On that day Roman army burnt 2d Temple. Also some other horrific events of Jewish history occured on the same day: destruction of 1st Temple by Babilonians, Expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492 and several other events. This fast falls usually on August. The roots of this fadt traditionaly related to biblical story of 12 spies. They came back to Moses and reported false report on that date.<br>  <br>  6. Taanit Behorot - Fast of firstborn. This fast is only for firstborn males. no one else is obligated to fast on that day. It occurs on Nissan 14th (Usually in march or Appril) one day before Passover. It is to commemarate that G-d killed all Egyptian firstborns from men to animals and saved Israelites. This is really light fast and in fact it is usually only symbolic. Starts in the morning and observed for just one hour or so. <br>  <br>  7. Taanit Ester - Fast of Ester 13th of Adar usually falls on March. One day before Purim. Related to Book of Ester and her request to all Jews to fast before she dared to appear before King uninvited with her request<br>  <br>  All Jewish fasts except Yom Kippur, Tisha Be Av and Taanit Behorot (in my list 1,5,6) start in the morning and end on the sunset. Yom Kippur and Tisha be Av (1,5) last from sunset to sunset.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	The Passover Holiday is not one that a person fasts on.  That would be Yom Kippur (the day of atonement).  Very religious Jews also fast on numerous other days during the year.|`|AA10796679	yum kippur

Not yet a direct train... it won't be start being built until next year...<br>  <br>  French uses a diffrent size rail-ways to here.<br>  <br>  So you must go from Bar?a to Perpignan, then Perpignan to Marseille<br>  <br>  www.tgv-europe.com and you must select it like this or it won't work<br>  <br>  The same if you want to go from Bilbo to París... you must a change|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Just to be sure you have the most accurate and up to date information, you can check:<br>  <br>  renfe.es (Spanish rail)<br>  SNCF (French rail...I imagine the website would be SNCF.fr, but you just put the first four letters into your search and it should come up)<br>  and Raileurope.com<br>  <br>  All three of those should give you the schedules betw. the two countries.|`|AA10998151	Hi,<br>  <br>  I just checked my current 2009 E-Urail train timetable for you and the ONLY train they have listed is:<br>  depart Barcelona at 08.45  <br>  arrive  Marseille   at 19.23<br>  <br>  ...so while that does not tell you there is an overnight train, it's probably because there is NOT one - so I would take it that my timetable is right & so are you because you had not found one!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, because it is up-to-date and a very reliable source|`|NZPgCcHWaa	Look into www.sncf.com (french RR) and into www.renfe.es (spanish RR) and also (most simple ) www.raileurope.com<br>  There is no thru-train. You will have to change trains in Narbonne.

7toznquyaa	The only Salvia (sage) you'll find in the bahamas is the Culinary kind.<br>  <br>  The psychogenic salvia is not grown here.. (it needs a different type of soil and environment. <br>  <br>  It's so easy to get marijuana here that it would be stupid to import such a lame drug.|`|fysEkCIUaa	No it is not legal. It is not legal to possess, grow or smoke it.<br>  Foreigners  who get caught with the illegal substance could face harsh legal consequences.
