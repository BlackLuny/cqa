If possible, I'd like to make/bake the snacks rather than buy them, since we're all poor college kids. So far mini-sandwiches and biscotti are a couple of ideas. Oh, yeah, and I can't eat beef or pork, but poultry and seafood are okay. Any ideas? :) Thanks for the help.

So just recently I've discovered Samuel Adams and I must say that I like this company's beer quite a bit more than any of the other brands that I have tried. The problem is that most stores that I have been to only carry the Cherry Wheat or Boston Lager but I have really been wanting to try a couple different kinds, such as the Honey Porter, Blackberry Witbier, and their seasonal beers.       Does anyone know of any chain stores that sell these? As far as I know neither Wal-Mart or Meijer carry these. I live in West Michigan and any help would be appreciated.      Thanks in advance.

Look at it this way if a man gets killed and we ate him we would go to jail and be convicted but we do that to animals instead nobody cares. Imagine how much pain and suffering those animals go through to die for our food if we turned vegetarian we wouldn't hurt nobody plants can't feel pain and we can get protein from pills. If you disagree just picture the pain the suffering what's it like to be born then killed straightaway if we lived in a vegetarian world we would bring peace to animals and our taste buds would get use to eating plants how do you think it works for vegetarians? Don't you think it's about time for change in our world?

Does everyone experience this or just me?      I took an allergy test and the only food item I reacted to was oranges. The Dr. said it was slight and I could still eat them, just don't go overboard. Grapefruit wasn't on the test, so I'm curious to know if I had a slight reaction to oranges maybe this is a more obvious reaction to grapefruit? I've never noticed any tingling with oranges.

I was steaming veggies with a thin-bottomed cheap stainless steel pot with steamer insert. The water boiled away, and the pot burned. I know all about cooling and cleaning the pot, and I did that, but it was a more severe burn that I've seen before, and the pot -- even though it looks almost like new -- still stinks with that burned metal stink. Can I safely use it to cook with? (And if you know... have I been poisoned by the metal smoke? I couldn't open up the house because it was storming outside, so I was breathing it all night.)

20090223141236AAWSNaW	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Can a ovo-lacto vegetarian truly be cruelty free?	I am an ovo-lacto vegetarian and have been eating organic milk, eggs and other dairy, in small quantities. I make a point to buy organic, free-range, and locally wherever possible, and consider myself to live as cruelty free as I possibly can. I eat many vegan meals and products and have considered making the change to full veganism, but to be totally honest I am very happy in my lifestyle as is. As far as I can tell there are many conflicting opinions on this subject and I am interested to hear more...Is what i'm doing enough to be cruelty free? Are there extra steps I can take to ensure that what dairy I do eat is not cruel to animals?

20090223110826AA6nyQp	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Macaroni Cheese......British, boxed, buy?	I want to find a source of boxed Macaroni Cheese from Great Britain.            This would NOT be "Macaroni AND Cheese."  It must say on the package Macaroni Cheese.       This would NOT be the canned kind, which is easy to find.  It must be the boxed kind with macaroni separate from its little pouch of cheese powder.  You cook the macaroni and then make the sauce with the powder, milk, and butter or margarine.           This will be for a gift.  The idea originated from "Are You Being Served?" and its fulfillment would be a delight to the birthday girl in April.  This gift would rank with Mars Bars (no longer made in the USA), which I found with only a little searching.                        So, if you know of any source that has BOXED MACARONI CHEESE from Great Britain, please let me know.  The world will be a better place!  Thank you very much.

20090223122652AAY5gA6	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Should I start eating meat again?	I'm 14 years old, and I'm a vegetarian. My religion does not require you not to eat meat, but it is a very good thing to do. I do not think I've been getting enough of the nutrients you need without it though, like zinc and protein. My hair is falling out a bit more than I think it should, and i've already noticed differences in my health.( bruising easier etc.) I really don't want to start eating meat again, but if I'm not able to get the reqiured nutrients without it i think I should start eating meat again. That is until i can move out on my own and stock my house with protein rich foods. What do you think I should do?
