cOMKOGtyaa	There are 5 lobes in the lung, 3 on the right and 2 on the left. The 'lobes' in the lung are basically just different sections which make up the entire lung. Basically the reason why it is divided up into parts is for anatomical purposes, and for the fact that each section functions as a seperate, but interconnected unit. Each lobe is divided by thin walls of tissue called fissures.    In the right lung, there is the superior, middle and inferior lobes. The left lung however only has a superior and inferior lobe. The superior is at the top, middle is in the middle (in the right lung), and inferior at the bottom of the lung.     Superior Lobe: The lobe of the right lung that lies above the oblique and horizontal fissures and includes the apical, posterior and anterior bronchopulmonary segments; in the left lung, the lobe lies above the oblique fissure and contains the apicoposterior, anterior, superior lingular and inferior lingular segments.     Middle Lobe: Located anteriorly between the horizontal and oblique fissures and includes lateral and medial bronchopulmonary segments.     Inferior Lobe: Located below and behind the oblique fissure and contains five bronchopulmonary segments: superior, medial basal, anterior basal, lateral basal, and posterior basal.     In general, each section or lobe have similar functions, they each contain branches of alveoli and their job is to work together to filter air and provide oxygen for the bloodstream.

wBbasieQaa	For (a), the number of outcomes where the two questions are together is 7!2!. If you think of the two questions as a single unit, then there are 7! permutations where they'll be together, and 2! possible orderings of the two questions. 7!2!/8! is 1/4.    For (b), the geometric question has to be the 4th question and the binomal question is 5th. The number of permutations of the first 4 questions allowing this is 3!, since the 4th question is fixed in place and the other three we don't care about. It's also 3! for the permutations of the last 4 questions, so the total probability here is (3!/4!)(3!/4!), or 1/16.    For (c) you need to test four cases:    (c1): The geometric question is 1st or 2nd  (c2): The binomal question is 7th or 8th  (c3): c1 and c2 are both true  (c4): The geometric question is 3rd and the binomial is 6th.    There are 2!3! permutations out of 4! for (c1) and likewise for (c2), so both of those are 2!3!/4!, or 1/2. (c3) is therefore 1/4. (c4) is identical to (b), since you're fixing each question in a specific spot, so that's 1/16. The total answer for (c) is (c1)+(c2)-(c3)+(c4). The reason you subtract (c3) is that it's already accounted for once each in (c1) and (c2) so you don't want to double-count it. The result is 13/16.
cbf5ef436bd348af732ccc7f87e069b9aa	If you substitute 1 for u, you get a limit of 0/0, which is not allowable.    Since u^4 - 1 is the difference of two squares, it can be factored (I won't go into detail):  u^4 - 1 = (u^2 + 1)(u^2 -1) = (u^2 + 1)(u + 1)(u - 1)    The denominator can be factored as well (again, I'll skip the long division because that's not really what the problem's about):  u^3 - 1 = (u^2 + u + 1)(u - 1)    The numerator and denominator have a common factor of (u - 1), so the fraction reduces to  (u^2 + 1)(u + 1)/(u^2 + u + 1)    Taking u = 1, the limit is  (1^2 + 1)(1 + 1)/(1^2 + 1 + 1) = 2*2/3 = 4/3.|`|zWuwHtJFaa	First of all, you have to see that just applying the limit leads you to the result 0/0 which is undetermined. Hence you can apply the L'Hospital's rule, that allows you to take the derivative of the denominator and of the numerator in order to get rid of the 0/0 form.  By deriving both the numerator and the denominator you get :    lim (4u^3) / (3u^2) = 4/3  u->1
AA11915874	FYI...  Chemical engineering is literally "applied differential equations".  most of the work is actually setting up the equations.   Which you do by hand anyway.  Solving the equations can be done in excel or mathcad.   Many of the classes and especially labs require typewritten reports.  Microsoft word is great for that.   Some of the classes, like process design, will require you to give presentations.. powerpoint.   And you may have to use chemcad to simulate a series of distillation columns.      So.. You're going to need to run these software packages    1) word  2) excel  3) powerpoint  4) mathcad.. maybe... depends on your diffeq abilities  5) chemcad... maybe...depends on your school...  6) some web browser with the ability to google  7) email ...

X8LNbaKQaa	That speed sounds like you are talking about a DC motor, probably a permanent magnet field motor.  The power is volts times amps, (22*24=528 watt) but that is more than rated power, so the rated power must be shaft power out.  That lets us calculate the conversion efficiency at about 350/528 =0.66 = 66%    The general rules of thumb for such motors are:   Speed is proportional to voltage.  (assumes torque load is constant)  Torque is proportional to current. (assumes speed remains constant)  Speed is inverse to torque.  (assumes voltage is constant)    Best efficiency usually occurs at about half rated torque (half rated current at rated voltage).  This will produce a speed somewhat higher than rated.    From those rules, if you cut the voltage to half and kept the torque load constant the speed would fall to half or about 1300RPM.     At 36 volts, and the rated torque load, the speed would rise to about 36/24 of rated speed or about 3900RPM, assuming the motor could handle that with either mechanical damage (windings flying out of armature slots or commutator bars arching over).    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	Do the specs say 24 volts DC?

nw62k2fJaa	__________________________________    ANSWER  103m  17.3m  __________________________________  ADDENDUM:   METHOD 1  Place a coordinate system on the arch so that its vertex is at the origin and its base is on y= -15. Then point (15,-15) is on the parabola.    Now, y=ax2 is the general form for all parabolas with vertex at the origin and the y-axis as the line of symmetry.  Given this setup, 10m above the ground is 5 units below the vertex. So, we need the distance between the two x values when y= -5.    Now, we're ready to do it.  y = ax2 ... substitute info from point (15,-15) to determine 'a'  -15 = a152  -15/152 = a  a = -1/15  Therefore,  y = -(1/15)x2 ... is the parabola.  We need x when y= -5  So,  -5 = -(1/15)x2  75 = x2  x = 53 when y= -5     The distance between -53 and 53 is  -53 - 53 = -103  = 103    Therefore, the arch is 103m  17.3m wide at 10m above the ground.  ______________________________________...  ______________________________________...  METHOD 2  Sketch the arch.   Place a coordinate system on it so that   the vertex is on the y-axis and  The base is on the x-axis.    Then the x-intercepts are   15 and -15, since the base is 30m wide.    The vertex is at (0,15), since the arch is 15m high and the vertex is on the y-axis.  __________________________________  Use the vertex form of a parabola.  y = a(x-h)2 + k ... where point (h,k) is the vertex.    We have the vertex (0,15) and a point (15,0).  Substituting into the formula gets  y = a(x - h)2 + k  0 = a(15-0)2 + 15  0 = 152a + 15  a = -15/152  a = -1/15  Therefore the equation of the parabola is  y = a(x - h)2 + k  y = -(1/15)(x-0)2 + 15  y = -(1/15)x2 + 15    To answer the question "How wide is the arch 10 m from the ground?" is to ask how wide is the parabola when y=10.  So, let y=10 and solve for x.    10= -(1/15)x2 + 15  -5 =  -(1/15)x2  75= x2  53 = x > This is half the distance across at 10m high  x = 53  So, we need the distance between  the points (-53,10) and (53,10)  that's  -53 - 53 = -103  = 103    Therefore, the arch is 103m  17.3m wide at 10m above the ground.  ______________________________________...|`|75e45e59dd10e580d1c1f1052e55d7edaa	turn the arch 90 degrees anti-clockwise and position the vertex at {0,0}-    (y1)^2/x1=(y2)^2/x2    y1=15,x1=15,x2=5  y1 is half the width at the base  y2 is half the width at the point 5m from the top,10m  from the ground  x2 is 5m from the top,10m from the ground    y^2=4ax.........equation of parabola    y^2/x=4a=a constant    the width is directly proportional to the sqrt of the height    (y1)^2/x1=(y2)^2/x2............(1)    (y2)^2=15^2*5/15    y2=15/sqrt3    therefore,    width at 10m from ground =30/(sqrt3) m~17.32m

Para se determinar o ponto de fus?o de algumas substancias, utiliza-se a tcnica do tubo de Thielle.     As substancias puras fundem-se a uma temperatura constante. J as impuras (misturas) n?o apresentam um nico ponto de fus?o definido e, sim, uma faixa de fus?o, que ser tanto maior quanto mais impurezas contiverem as substancias.    Dependendo do aparelho o aquecimento pode ser feito eletricamente ou atravs de banho. H vrios lquidos que podem ser utilizados como banho de aquecimento e, neste caso, o lquido escolhido depende do slido a ser fundido.    A tabela abaixo mostra os lquidos mais comumente utilizados como banho. Os valores dos pontos de fus?o encontrado na tabela abaixo, foram determinados  press?o de 1 atm (760 mmHg).

Para se determinar o ponto de fus?o do Naftaleno, por exemplo, utilizando a tcnica do tubo de Thielle, procederamos da seguinte forma:  Pulverizar uma pequena por??o de Naftaleno em um almofariz.   Fechar uma das extremidades do capilar no bico de Bunsen.   Introduzir o Naftaleno no capilar, compactando-o. Proceder a compacta??o da amostra, deixando o capilar cair por uma vareta de vidro. Esta opera??o dever ser repetida tantas vezes quantas forem necessrias, para que se tenha compactado, no capilar, aproximadamente 1 cm da substancia.   Prender, atravs de anel de ltex, o capilar ao term?metro, de tal forma que a parte que contm a amostra fique junto ao bulbo do mesmo.   Montar a aparelhagem, utilizando como banho Glicerina.   Aquecer o tubo de Thielle lentamente, deslizando a chama sobre a parte lateral inferior do mesmo.   Observar cuidadosamente at o ponto de fus?o e anot-lo.|`|6c004066ee837825e7bb97fef465be57aa	Caso seja possvel, devemos aquecer a amostra at que esta se decomponha a uma temperatura determinada ou venha a entrar em ebuli??o. Se ambas apresentarem os mesmos valores, ent?o trata-se de mesma substancia, caso contrrio, devem ser substancias diferentes.    No entanto, algumas substancias n?o sofrem altera??o com o aumento de temperatura depois de fundidas, ou nosso aparelho de medir ponto de fus?o n?o tem uma temperatura mxima muito elevada.  Podemos nos basear na propriedade de fus?o para amostras impuras.    Substancias puras apresentam um ponto de fus?o constante e com pequeno intervalo de varia??o.  Isto n?o acontece com substancias impuras, que tm o ponto de fus?o alterado e com grande varia??o em termos de temperatura de fus?o.  O que podemos fazer  pegar uma massa igual para as duas substancias e adicionarmos uma massa igual de uma terceira substancia sobre ambas, de forma a torn-las impuras propositalmente.   Depois de uma boa homogeniza??o em um almofariz, medimos o ponto de fus?o de ambas as misturas preparadas. Se o intervalo de fus?o for o mesmo para ambas as amostras,  muito provvel que A e B sejam a mesma substancia, e caso haja diferen?a, podemos apostar que A e B sejam substancias diferentes.    Obs.: tentei resolver o problema com a aparelhagem que o laboratrio nos informou que possui, ou seja, um aparelho de determina??o de ponto de fus?o. Normalmente, aquecendo-se a amostra por ponto de degrada??o ou decomposi??o, poderemos determinar se h alguma diferen?a entre ambas, ai, bastaria apeas continuar o aquecimento no mesmo aparelho com a mesma amostra.  A outra alternativa foi tambm fazendo uso do aparelho, mas com uma informa??o a mais: misturas de substancias diferentes fazem com que o ponto de fus?o tenha uma varia??o.  Misturar A com B funciona? Sim na grande mairia dos casos, se A e B forem compostos diferentes com o mesmo ponto de fus?o, o ponto de fus?o da mistura tender a variar.  Porm, alguns compostos que apresentam o mesmo ponto de fus?o, como os enanti?meros podem n?o apresentarem diferen?a de temperatura de fus?o quando misturados.  o caso por exemplo do cloridrato de de alfa-amino propiofenona, que apresenta a particularidade de cada um dos is?meros opticamente ativos ter um ponto de fus?o 189-191C, enquanto a mistura deles (racmico) possui praticamente o mesmo ponto de fus?o 190-191C. No entanto, quando misturados a uma terceira substancia opticamente ativa, seus pontos de fus?o apresentar?o uma mensurvel diferen?a.|`|f167f3c656ec63d611a4ae86f2619bd0aa	Vc tem vrias maneira de fazer isso:    vc pode determinar a densidade dos dois... se forem diferentes n?o ser?o a mesma substancia!    Ou simplesmente observando a cor e textura dos dois... se for a mesma substancia para os dois, a cor e textura ter?o que ser as mesmas!    Vc pode ver se uma delas reage com cido ou base e a outra n?o...    E vc pode tambm ( mais difcil se for slido) determinar a temperatura de ebuli??o!

I just wrapped it with electrical tape to hold the wire in place.    .|`|HTmj2BXDaa	In general, loose wires occur because of entropy.  In your particular case, could be a number of reasons.  The range of potential root causes depends on exactly what type of wire and what type of device it is held in.  Per the first answer, yes it could be result of a mnfg problem or vibration.  It could also be metal fatigue due to vibration, could be creep if it is a soldered joint, it could be thermal fatigue if the connection has been heated and cooled repeatedly, could be a metallurgial defect in the wire itself, it could be physical damage to the wire itself, could be a problem in the socket it connects with.    How to fix it depends on the root cause but you could always buy a new adapter (& support the world economy).
PhvJe0ulaa	I will go ahead and solve x + y = 7 for y and get y = 7 - x       and i got that by subtracting x from both sides.    Now that i know y is equal to 7 - x, i can substitute (7-x) into the other equation of x - y = 3, once i substitute I get    x - (7 - x) = 3    Now i distribute the negative and get x - 7 + x = 3  Now you subtract negative seven from both sides which is the same as adding 7 to both sides because subtracting a negative is adding. Now we get x + x = 10,    Add the two x's and you get 2x = 10,   divide both sides by 2 leaves us with x = 5.    now that we know x = 5, we can plug it into either one of the original equations and solve for y.     x + y = 7,  substitute     5 + y = 7,  subtract 5 from both sides and we get y = 2.|`|lvJ1WcjCaa	x - y = 3   +  x + y = 7  ------------------       2x = 10      x = 5        x - y = 3       5 - y = 3       y = 2    x=5, y=2|`|8a2c7511cfabb2e759e39cfc0b3a6c82aa	x-y=3  x+y=7  2x=10    x=5    when x=5 then y=2|`|AA10266675	add the two equations together.

hHVMrnK3aa	Verifying the answer is easy, finding it in the first place, a little more work.    Verification: 13 * 37 = 481  481 = 8 * 60 + 1  Hence if you divide 13 * 37 by 60 you have remainder 1.    Alternate answers:    Any integer of the form (37 + 60 k) where k is any integer is also a solution.  (97, -23, etc.)    To find the solution you can proceed as follows:  Solve:  13 d = 1 + 60 k  mod 13:  0 = 1 + 8k (mod 13)  8k = -1 (mod 13)  Add 13's until a multiple of 8 is found:  8k = 12 or 25 or 38 or 51 or 64 .... aha a multiple of 8!  k = 64 / 8 = 8   Substitute k = 8 back into 13 d = 1 + 60 k  13 d = 1 + 8 * 60 = 481  481 /13 = 37  and that is the answer.

A nicotina est presente em toda a planta do tabaco, mas principalmente nas folhas, correspondendo a 5% em peso da planta. Tanto o tabaco (Nicotiana tabacum) quanto a nicotina foram denominadas por Jean Nicot, um embaixador de Portugal, que enviou sementes de tabaco para Paris, em 1550.

AA11522841	A) The car has kinetic energy embodied by its relative speed. The brakes dissipate this energy as a frictive loss, largely by turning it into heat and by ablation, until the car has no kinetic energy left, and has stopped.    Kinetic energy is: KE = (1/2)mv^2    B) Only force acting the same direction as the motion produces work. The force of tension from the truck's cable can be divided into two components by:     Fx = Tcos40, Fy = Tsin40    The mass of the object moved is irrelevent, work is proportional to the force exerted and the distance moved by:    W = Fd    C) As the truck is raised, it gains potential gravitational energy.

One meter, since:    3ms^-1 / 3s^-1 = 1m    3) This is subject to the same relation as the problem above, namely: v = lambda*f. Where v is velocity, lambda is wave length, and f is frequency.    In this case, f= = 2.5s^-1    4) If an object is moving and emiting sound (waves), the waves in front of the object will be compressed (higher freqency) and the waves behind it will be elongated (lower frequency) since the object is in a different location each time is emits a wave.    6) This is called the  "Doplar" effect.|`|3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	If it is in a solid or liquid that is in the vacuum, no gas and no sound waves in the vacuum itself    1 m    2.5 Hz    relative frequency increases    decreases    Doppler effect|`|594bc646fd33e8b5155f53fb4c7b9220aa	1) Mechanical waves require a medium to propagate in.

f167f3c656ec63d611a4ae86f2619bd0aa	N?o entendi muito bem sua pergunta, pois  muito geral... mas vou tentar responder assim mesmo!    Extens?o  a propriedade que o corpo tem de ocupar um lugar no espa?o; portanto, todo corpo material ocupa um lugar no espa?o (tem volume).     Impenetrabilidade  a propriedade que diz: "Dois ou mais corpos n?o podem, simultaneamente (ao mesmo tempo), ocupar o mesmo lugar no espa?o".     Divisibilidade  a propriedade que a matria apresenta de poder ser dividida em partes cada vez menores.     Descontinuidade ou porosiade  a propriedade da matria de apresentar espa?os vazios denominados poros ou espa?os intramoleculares.     Elasticidade  a propriedade que determinados materiais coesos apresentam de ampliar ou reduzir os espa?os intramoleculares, sob a a??o de uma for?a externa. Quando a for?a cessa, voltam ao estado inicial.     Compressibilidade  a propriedade da matria de poder ser comprimida, quando nela se aplica uma for?a externa.     Propriedades funcionais da matria    S?o as propriedades que caracterizam um grupo de substancias, denominadas fun??es qumicas.   Exemplos:     - tornar vermelho o papel azul de tornassol  uma propriedade funcional da fun??o cido;   - ser inflamvel  uma propriedade dos combustveis.     Propriedades especficas da matria    S?o as propriedades que caracterizam cada substancia individualmente. As propriedades especficas podem ser divididas em:     Organolpticas: s?o as propriedades identificadas pelo nosso sentido (cor, sabor...)    Fsicas: s?o as propriedades que podemos medir. Os valores dessas medidas s?o chamados constantes fsicas (P.F., P.E., d)      Outros conceitos:    Substancias: s?o os diversos tipos de matria que conhecemos.     Corpo:  uma por??o limitada da matria, ou seja, um peda?o da matria.     Objeto:  um corpo com uma finalidade especfica.     Molcula:  a menor parte da divis?o de uma substancia.     tomos: s?o as partes de que  formada uma molcula.     Volume:  o espa?o ocupado por um corpo.     Massa:  a medida da quantidade de matria de que um corpo  formado.    UFA!!! Deu trabalho escrever isso!!!

f167f3c656ec63d611a4ae86f2619bd0aa	Em 1911, Rutherford e colaboradores (Geiger e Marsden) bombardearam uma lamina metlica delgada com um feixe de partculas alfa atravessava a lamina metlica sem sofrer desvio na sua trajetria (para cada 10.000 partculas alfa que atravessam sem desviar, uma era desviada). Para explicar a experincia, Rutherford concluiu que o tomo n?o era uma bolinha maci?a.           Admitiu uma parte central positiva muito pequena mas de grande massa ("o ncleo") e uma parte envolvente negativa e relativamente enorme ("a eletrosfera ou coroa").           Se o tomo tivesse o tamanho do Estdio do Morumbi, o ncleo seria o tamanho de uma azeitona. Surgiu assim o modelo nuclear do tomo.           O modelo de Rutherford  o modelo planetrio do tomo, no qual os eltrons descrevem um movimento circular ao redor do ncleo, assim como os planetas se movem ao redor do sol.      dificil explicar aqui pois n?o d para postar imagens pra ajudar na explica??o!

Isso foi de encontro ao modelo a^t?omico de Thomson, tomo homogneo. Em fevereiro de 1911, Rutherfor defendeu uma tese intitulada "Da dispers?o das partculas alfa e beta pela matria e da estrutura do tomo", em que chegou s conclus?es que o levaram a elaborar um novo modelo at?mico: o tomo nuclear. Nesse modelo, explicou-se os desvios das partculas alfa positivas, admitindo que o ncleo  positivo e, portanto, formado por prtons. As partculas que n?o atravessavam a lamina teriam colidido frontalmente com esses ncleos. Como o tomo  neutro, o ncleo positivo estaria cercado pelos eltrons numa regi?o negativa, que foi denominada eletrosfera. Rutherfor disp?s que os eltrons estariam dispostos ao redor do ncleo, como os planetas ao redor do sol. Rutherford ainda observou que a massa do ncleo era muito maior que a sua carga, concluindo ent?o que no ncleo deveriam existir partculas sem carga eltrica e de massa igual a do prton, o que foi comprovado somente em 1932, por James Chadwick, com a descoberta dos neutrons. Espero que tenha ajudado.|`|jvSBRiG4aa	 o seguinte: Rutherford propos um modelo at?mico conhecido como modelo planetrio do tomo... Imagina o sol com os planetas girando em torno dele...

Mas no caso da gua entrar por baixo, ela vai sair por cima apenas por transbordo, ou seja, o que controla a saida de gua do condensador  a quantidade de gua que entra.

Primeiro, pelo seu custo, que acaba sendo alto, depois, pela sua disponibilidade, estocagem e manuseio, que s?o difceis. As empresas que o produzem s o vendem em quantidades muito grandes. O aspecto prtico tambm  negativo: ele vaporiza de forma extremamente rpida, e ao introduzirmos um recipiente com gua no nitrognio lquido, estamos introduzindo uma quantidade enorme de calor, que far com que o nitrognio cavite evaporando rapidamente, n?o dando tempo para a gua solidificar por completo, haver solidifica??o apenas na parte em contato com o recipiente que a contm.   Sua energia latente de vaporiza??o  muito baixa, comparada  energia necessria para baixar a temperatura e congelar a gua.  Desta forma, para fazermos um gelo do tamanho de um copo de gua, precisaremos de uns 20 L de nitrognio lquido.

Estes dois fatores juntos colaboram grandemente para o sucesso da purifica??o por recristaliza??o.      Por exemplo: podemos recristalizar o antiviral ritonavir em acetato de etila e hexano.     Se usarmos acetato de etila puro, sua recristaliza??o ser demorada, e a maior parte do nosso produto permanecer em solu??o. Por outro lado, outros solventes n?o dissolvem t?o bem este produto, sendo necessrio us-los em um volume muito grande.  Ent?o inicialmente adicionamos acetato de etila puro, e quando j tivermos dissolvido todo o nosso produto, ao adicionarmos hexano  solu??o formada, este faz com que a polaridade do solvente como um todo caia, uma vez que o hexano  bastante apolar, isto causa o favorecimento da precipita??o do ritonavir, mas n?o de suas impurezas.

Killer whales have several adaptations to help them stay warm even in frigid water:    a. A killer whale has a thick layer of body fat, called blubber, that lies underneath its skin.  This blubber layer, from 7.6 to 10 cm (3 - 4 in.) thick, insulates the whale and streamlines its body.     b. The killer whale's fusiform body shape and reduced limb size, in comparison to land mammals, decreases the amount of surface area exposed to the external environment.   Blubber also functions as an energy reserve.    c. In general, cetaceans have a higher metabolic rate than land mammals of similar size.  This increased metabolism generates a great deal of body heat.     d. Mammals lose body heat when they exhale.  Because they breathe less frequently than land mammals, killer whales conserve a considerable amount of heat.    4. A killer whale's circulatory system adjusts to conserve or dissipate body heat and maintain body temperature.     a. Arteries in the flippers, flukes, and dorsal fin are surrounded by veins.   Thus, some heat from the blood traveling through the arteries is transferred to the venous blood rather than the environment.   b. This countercurrent heat exchange helps whales to conserve body heat.  When a whale dives, blood is shunted away from the body surface.  This decrease in circulation conserves body heat as well.     5. During prolonged exercise or in warm water, a killer whale may need to dissipate body heat.  In this case, circulation increases to arteries near the surface of the flippers, flukes, and dorsal fin, and deceases to arteries providing blood to the body core.  Excess heat is shed to the external environment.

It is required that (1,-6) satisfies the equation.  Hence 1-1/2(-6).=c, or c=1+3=4.  The desired equation is thus  x-1/2 y = 4.

ffJcrsmLaa	Generally, when a reaction occurs between an acid and a base, water and a salt will be produced. Keep that in mind, you'll know then that H2O is almost guaranteed to be a product. The other product will be a salt made up of the anion in the Acid and the cation in the Base.    a. HCl + KOH ---> H20 + KCl   (see how water is one product        and the other product is just what's left over)    b. H2SO4 + Mg(OH)2 ---> 2H2O + MgSO4.   (Remember the 2 after the OH because OH has a 1- charge and Mg has a 2+ charge. And since you have 2 Hydroxides and 2 Hydrogens as reactants, you'll have 2 waters as products when you balance.)    c. H2SO3 + 2NaOH ---> 2H2O + Na2SO3 (Just remember "a light is on in the house" [corny, I know] so since you have sulfurOUS acid, it's a sulfITE compound, and sulfite is SO3 with a 2+ charge. Then just be careful with the charges and balancing)    d. HCl + NaOH ---> H2O + NaCl   (Shouldn't be too hard)|`|X0e6p9Ilaa	a.  Simple acid-base reactions (i.e. Arrhenius acid-base reaction) will produced a salt and water.   KCl and H2O will be produced.    b.  MgSO4 and H2O will be produced.    c.  H2SO3 + 2NaOH -->  Na2SO3 + 2H2O    d.  See (a)    The salt will always contain the cation (+ ion) of the base and the anion (- ion) of the acid.  Make sure that the subscripts of the cation and anion are such that the sum of the ionic charges will equal zero.  Of course water (often written as HOH) contains the H from the acid and the OH from the base.  Acid-base reactions are double replacement reactions.|`|AA12206602	You need to know.

AA12206602	IF water is 21% then CaSO4 is 79%.    I mol CaSO4 = 136 g.  that 136  g = 79% by mass of the total compund.  Therefore we can find the mass of 100% of the compound = 136/0.79 =171.2 g    Therefore mass of water present equals 171.2-136 =36.2  CaSO4.2H20  l mol H20= 28 there fore 36 g contains 2 mols.    therefore the formula of the compound CaSO4.2H2O

DwU4js3Qaa	a solute is a substance that is dissolved in a liquid.  a solvent is the liquid a solute is dissolved in.  for example, salt water...salt is the solute, water is the solvent.    A saturated solution is a solution which has the same amount of solvent as solute, thus no more solute will dissolve.  So take salt water again for example. Once you have added enough salt for the solution to be saturated, there isnt enough water to salt ratio to dissolve anymore salt, and the salt crystals will remain undissolved. as you continue adding more salt to the solution, you will start to get a paste, rather than the water continuing to dissolve the salt, because theres more salt than water.|`|AA12206602	INncrease the temp of the water., more bonds can be broken and formed.    solvent - substnace that does the dissloving  solute - substance that is dissolved    a saturated solution contains the maxium mass of solute  at a given temp. so when more solute is added it woun;t dissolve

We know that x has to be greater than zero, so it must be 2.    I just realized you might have made a typo on the first part.    If instead you're looking for x = 2+2+2+2......    Then you square x and get    x^2 = 2 +2+2+2+2+2 = 2 + x    x^2 - x -2 = 0    (x-2)(x+1) = 0    x=-1 or x = 2, but we know x is positive, so the value of the series is 2.

Now divide by two:    x^2 / 2 = sqrt(2 * sqrt(2 * sqrt(2 ... )))    But notice that the right side IS x (because the surd is infinite).    x^2/2 = x    Solve for x:  x^2 - 2x = 0    x = 2 or x = 0  Note that we've created the extranneous solution x = 0.    So:  2 = sqrt(2 * sqrt(2 * sqrt(2 * sqrt(2 ...))))      Note: I'm not sure if I've interpreted your problem correctly, so I'll solve another one:    Let y = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + ...)))    Again, find an operation that makes the right side equal to y again; work backwards.    y^2 = 2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + ... ))  y^2 -2 = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + ...)))    y^2 - 2 = y  y^2 - y - 2 = 0  (y - 2) (y+1) = 0  y = 2 or y = -1    y = -1 is an extranneous solution (as can clearly be seen sqrt(2 + sqrt(2 + ...)) must be positive).

AA11808736	Depende do tipo de Lampada!     Lampada Fluorescente utiliza a descarga eltrica atravs de um gs para produzir energia luminosa. consistem em um tubo de vidro, tendo em suas extremidades eletrodos metlicos de tungstnio (catodos), por onde circula corrente eltrica. Em seu interior existe vapor de mercrio ou arg?nio a baixa press?o e as paredes s?o pintadas com materiais fluorescentes, conhecidos por cristais de fsforo.  Os eltrons deslocando-se no interior da lampada, esbarram nos tomos do vapor de mercrio. Estes choques provocam libera??o de energia luminosa n?o visvel, tipo radia??o ultra violeta. Esta radia??o transmite-se em todas as dire??es e , em contato com a pintura fluorescente do tubo, produz radi??o luminosa visvel.    As Lampadas Incandescentes  utilizam um fio de tungstnio encerrado num bulbo de vidro. Esse fio tem diametro inferior a 0,1 mm e  enrolado segundo uma hlice cilndrica. Passando corrente eltrica no filamento, ele se aquece a uma temperatura da ordem de 3.000 o C. O filamento torna-se, ent?o, incandescente e come?a a emitir luz. No interior da lampada n?o pode haver ar, pois dos contrrio o filamento se oxida e incendeia-se. Antigamente fazia-se vcuo no interior do bulbo, porm isso facilitava a sublima??o do filamento (passagem do estado slido para o estado de vapor). Passaram, ent?o, a injetar um gs inerte, em geral o arg?nio ou cript?nio.A lampada incandescente  uma lampada de baixo rendimento, gera muito mais calor do que luz. Apenas 5% da energia, aproximadamente,  transformada em luz.  Para obter diferentes luminosidades, o fabricante altera, geralmente, a espessura do filamento: quanto maior a espessura maior a corrente eltrica e, portanto, maior a luminosidade.|`|98d88d174b20bc903e04214baa84b2a3aa	ok  boa sua pergunta,realmente muita gente se faz essa   pergunta.como funciona?o que faz ela brilhar ,,,    veja neste link - http://br.geocities.com/saladefisica7/fu...     bem explicado ,,|`|O11OYEFdaa	Ol,   se for uma lampada incandecente  assim:    dentro dela h um filamento resistente a altas temperaturas chamado tusistenio, quando para eletricidade nele, por ser resistente ele aquece, chegando a ficar ao rubro, com isso solta radia??o luminosa.    se for uma florescente  assim,    nela h um gs, que quando ionozado por cauda da difere?a de potencial nela aplicada os eletros solta de uma camada para outra, nesse pulo solta radia??o luminosa(energia).    abra?os|`|bc852e4d941e3099062eb0e6a1acbc2daa	Depende do tipo.  A lampada incandescente funciona pela emiss?o de luz a partir de um filamento de tungstnio super aquecido.  lampadas florescentes utilizam em seu interior um gas inerte e vapor de mercrio, com a passagem da corrente eltrica os tomos de mercrio s?o excitados, fazendo com que os eltrons saltem para uma rbita de maior energia, ao retornar  rbita original emitem luz ultra violeta que ao incidirem sobre a superfcie florescente provocam su luminescncia.  As lampadas Halogenas tambm possuem um filamento super aquecido, semelhante as incandescentes. A diferen?a  que as lampadas incandescentes produzem vapor de tungstnio que ir aderir ao bulbo de vidro. Este bojo dever ser bastante grande para evitar o rpido escurecimento. As lampadas halogenas utilizam um gs halogeno que reconduz o vapor de volta para o filamento.

90ba812fb99cf771f50f8df06063d0b6aa	lipids              a broad class of organic products found in living systems. Most are insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar solvents. The definition excludes the mineral oils and other petroleum products obtained from fossil material. Major classes of lipids include the fatty acids, the glycerol-derived lipids (including the fats and oils and the phospholipids), the sphingosine-derived lipids (including the ceramides, cerebrosides, gangliosides, and sphingomyelins), the steroids and their derivatives, the terpenes and their derivatives, certain aromatic compounds, and long-chain alcohols and waxes. In living organisms lipids serve as the basis of cell membranes and as a form of fuel storage. Often lipids are found conjugated with proteins or carbohydrates, and the resulting substances are known as lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides. The fat-soluble vitamins can be classified as lipids. Liposomes are spherical vesicles formed by mixing lipids with water or water solutions. They have found applications in the oral administration of some drugs (e.g., insulin and some cancer drugs), since they retain their integrity until they are broken down by the lipases in the stomach and small intestine.|`|020afdf8ab20203ec50dfcf3a7fa7e79aa	they are fats and that is all i know|`|da878ec739a1d54b8d6e2e8964bb695caa	lipids are fats. and we all know what fats do. they do everything from protect each individual cell in your body by creating a thin fatty layer areound each of your body cells that acts as a barrier that lets stuff in and out. it also can build up just under the skin and cause you to be fat. lipids are a necessary part of life.|`|25bc69da398195c665872a3985cdfc77aa	From what I remember from AP Biology last year, lipids are glycerol connected to fatty acids by ester bonds. Fats are very effective in maintaining the warmth of the animal (that's why polar bears are so "fat") and in cushioning your organs (or else it's very painful for your lungs to rub against your heart all the time). Lipids are the main site for storing energy, but sugars are a more ready source for energy. In fact, lipids store twice as much energy as sugars. Hope this helps.|`|c7f4026787d8bec9e58e871b4aadd333aa	Lipids are composed of fatty acids and glycerides. Their functions are:  1- Long term energy source,  2- Cell membrane structure,  3- Heat generation and preservation,  4- Protection,  5- Hormone production.   6- Signal transduction.

The owners of the historic building could make a great deal of money by selling their building and allowing a thirty-five story office building to be built in its place.

Back to your question:  mass of cloud = density x volume = 0.5 g/m3 x 1,000,000,000 m3 = 5 x 10^8g or 500,000,000g|`|73916b4c6b75932ff784d064446d5bafaa	There's a rule that tells you:  Density = mass divided by Volume  (D = m/V)    So if you know the density (D) and the volume (V), then you should be able to solve for the mass:  D = m/V  D*V = m    So if Density times Volume = mass, then you can go:  (0.5 g/m^3) * (1,000,000,000 m^3) = mass  500,000,000 g = mass    Notice that the m^3 cancels out (g/m^3 * m^3 = g) in the above equation.    So now you have mass.  Mass and weight are closely related.  If you remember, mass never changes, but weight *does.*  (So if I were floating in space, I would weigh almost nothing, but my mass would be the same.)    Do you know what makes weight so different?  Gravity.  So here's another equation to learn:  Weight = mass times gravity (W = m*g)    So you know mass (but be careful!  mass must always be in kilograms (kg) for this equation to work), and gravity on Earth is 9.8 m/s^2 (that's a given).  That means you can find Weight:  W = m*g  W = (500,000 kg) * (9.8 m/s^2)  W =  4,900,000 kg*m/s^2    (kg*m/s^2 is also called a "Newton" or "N")    So there's your answer!  Get it?|`|f7b9ddeb889ee3d504c6efa6ebdd6e30aa	mass = density * Volume    = 0.5 g/m3 * 1000,000,000 m3   = 500,000,000 g  = 500,000 kg    weight = mass * gravity acceleration    = 500,000 * 9.8  = 4,900,000 N|`|af05b0ac8e18e5786d6c9e466a234d4caa	ok. density x volume will give you the weight    therefore, (.5g/m3)(1.0x10^9)= 5.0 x 10^8g    if you need to convert it to kilograms, simply divide by 1000.    which would give you 5.0 x 10^5kg or 50,000kg

During meiosis, (which is the process used to make gametes), one copy of your dad's chromosome lines up next to the copy of your mom's chromosome, and they will swap segments.    So let's say that your dad's chromosome had an alleles for brown hair and brown eyes, and your mom's had an allele for blue eyes and blond hair (plus, of course, each chromosome has alleles for all the other few thousand genes located onthat chromosome).  If a crossover happens between those two genes on that chromosome, you will make gametes that contain a chromosome that is part your mom's and part your dad's.  So your gametes might contain a chromosome that has alleles for blue eyes and brown hair, and another gamete might have a chromosome that has the alleles for brown eyes and blond hair.  The benefit is that now your offspring can have much more variety, because you can make a huge number of different gametes, each with a different mix 'n match of your mom's alleles and your dad's alleles    The closer two genes are to each other on the chromosome, the less likely it is that the crossover will happen between them.|`|AA10903824	It is in meiosis when the two chromatid pairs swap a little segment.

It is, however, toxic to an embryo and as you asked, progesterone is a hormone which does stimulate the uterus to undergo its menstrual cycle.    Over the course of a 28 day cycle, the two hormones estrogen and progesterone increase and decrease at a set rate. The estrogen levels peak approximately 7 days before the progesterone levels peak. The increasing estrogen levels tell the uterus to thicken its wall, and the levels of progesterone and estrogen will rapidly drop if there has been no fertilization or spontaneous abortion of the fertilized embryo. The drop in these levels is what triggers the menorrhagia.    However, a hormonal IUD actually decreases your bleeding by controlling these hornomes. If you've recently had one implanted, you should be experiencing amenorrhia (the lack of menstrual cycles) or something close to it. As hormonal IUDs are relatively new, if you're experiencing increased bleeding, it would sound as if your hormonal IUD is functioning as a traditional IUD, and may be defective or improperly installed.    Contact your physician, ASAP.
NFdEeVEkaa	Because of the carbon, I think|`|d14c9a42bac00be0412030ad76a667afaa	Lancenigo di Villorba (TV), Italy    FUNDAMENTs  Raisin is a mixture of Organic Compounds.  These show different level of water-solubility, usually there will be a Small Part of Soluble compounds of Soluble Fraction.  The different nature existing among water and raisin will slows down the dissolution of the Soluble Fraction.    DISCUSSION  I executed NEVER this experiment.  I KNOW NOT IF IT IS THE CORRECT ANSWER.  I thought you refer to very small water amounts, as drops or more few great things.  Easily, the Raisin's amount will dissociate in Small Particles.  Once Raisin results spread it release its soluble part.  This isn't an Equilibrium Condition, since around the Raisin there are the soluble components whilst they aren't away it.  Thus, the soluble component begin to move way the Raisin itself : these are Mass's Transfers.  The Space offered by Small Water System impeach the Mass's Transfers inside this Closed Volume.  Temperature gets favour to Mass Transfer between Aqueous Bulk and the Raisin's Balls.  These liquid transfers push away the Raisin's Balls along the Aqueous Bulk.  When the Liquid System joins at the Uniformity Condition, the dance will stop.

AA11762422	The way you asked the question, do you mean yo want the speed when the mass has traveled halfway from 9.7 cm to the equilibrium, or 4.85 cm?    This can be solved using conservation of energy:  The energy stored in the spring is  .5*56*(9.7/100)^2  The kinetic energy at release is  .5*1.1*0.27^2    after the mass traveles half the distance, the difference in stored energy in the spring gets converted to kinetic energy of the mass.    .5*56*((9.7/100)^2-  (9.7/200)^2)    add the starting kinetic energy    and set equal to the final kinetic energy    .5*1.1*v^2=0.1976+0.04  v=sqrt(2*0.2376/1.1)  v=0.657 m/s    j

ZepaRVTGaa	The GM tube normally plugs into another instrument, either a scaler or a ratemeter.    A scaler provides the necessary high voltage supply to the tube and incorporates a counter to count the number of events.  You normally use a stopwatch set a suitable time interval and note the number of events registered in that time.    A ratemeter gives a direct readout of the number of events occurring per second.    A scaler is more fiddly to use, but generally considered more accurate.    Hope that helps|`|e1aa34ce677bb92dd3747be5ff158ba4aa	The GM tube needs to be connected through an instrument which supplied the voltage and counts.

mAVRnQqcaa	There are two equations we can use to calculate the Doppler Effect.    Siince we have a moving listener, we use the equation    F' = [(v0 + vS)/v0](F)   v0 is the velocity of the person and vS is the velocity of the source. F is the frequency of the source sound waves and F' is the observed frequency.  Once you plug in these numbers and get F', you use the equation    (frequency)(wavelength) = speed of the sound.    Plugging in the wavelength, you get the speed of the sound taken relative to the man's speed. We use a plus sign in the equation because the man is moving toward the source of the sound he is listening to.|`|Fnhdp0nHaa	Speed of sound cannot be heard by the man, it is only the frequency which the man will hear. If the source is moving towards the man the frequency as heard by the man will b more than the actual frequency of the sound. As far as speed is concerned you can only calculate the relative speed of sound with respect to man. Suppose the man is moving with a velocity of 10 m/s towards the source of sound. The relative velocity of sound with respect to man will be 10-(-340) = 10 +340 = 350 m/s.|`|y6PS4wQkaa	its very easy.............    why dont u join Ramanuja School of Mathematics and post ur question over here................  http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=...    u will get answer within 24 hours and absulute accurately....|`|xlo2PRjDaa	It depends on how fast the quitar player is playing.|`|eE7f9jk9aa	Well since the man can't hear the "speed" of the sound, only the frequency, I'm going to assume that's what you're asking.  To account for the doppler effect, divide the speed you're moving toward the sound by the speed of sound.  In this case, 20/340 which gives you .058 or 5.8%, so the sound will be 5.8% higher pitched to the man who is moving toward the source.

nVomdtpEaa	Are you concerned about memory loss? Learn why drinking fresh and pure water is the natural way to ensure healthy brain function throughout your entire life.    Waters Role In Healthy Brain Function    Water plays an extremely important role in your diet and bodily functions. Many parts of your brain draw much of their energy from water.    Water must be taken into your body in its pure, natural state, optimally drink half your body weight in ounces daily.    Water is vital to energy production in your cells and in your overall metabolism, and neurotransmission. Nerve transmission is heavily dependent upon water. Small waterways, or micro-streams run along the full length of your nerves. These streams float the neurotransmitters along microtubules to the nerve endings.    When your body is dehydrated, nerve transmission is compromised and brain function strongly diminished. Chronic nerve pain can simply be the end result of chronic dehydration.    Numerous chronic and painful conditions, including arthritis and fibromyalgia, can often be significantly reduced after adequate rehydration.    Another important consideration is that water actually holds the cells of your body together. Water keeps the cell membrane together by forming hydronium ions which makes the water sticky and helps bond your cells together. This gives your cells a higher viscosity that helps increase the efficiency of proteins and enzymes.    In a dehydrated cell, the metabolism, is greatly impaired. Dehydration has a particularly dramatic effect on sugar metabolism, the immune system, and detoxification. Dehydration profoundly effects the movement of lymph through the body and causes the lymph system to clog up and malfunction.    From a cellular point of view, the transmission of nutrients through the cell wall is conducted by water. Many deficiency conditions are often specific dehydration problems.    Dehydration is a significant producer of free radicals in your body and effective hydration removes free radicals faster than most any other therapy. A fully hydrated body can reduce your need for antioxidant supplements.    Lung dehydration is considered a significant factor in respiratory diseases. Sometimes the most dramatic results can be obtained in asthma and chronic bronchitis with simple rehydration. Dehydration is a major producer of stress in the body and alters the balance of amino acids. This can result in DNA errors during cell division which can lead to many diseases such as cancer and other cell mutation problems.    Water is a vital conductor of energy such as your meridian and chakra energy systems. When your body is dehydrated, it is very difficult for energy based therapies such as acupunture, Reiki, Bowenwork? and BodyTalk? to work.    Due to an imbalance in the cellular environment many people's body cells and brain tissues are dehydrated, despite drinking adequate amounts of water. The BodyTalk System has a procedure that specifically addresses any underlying factors that may be limiting the absorption of water throughout your body.

Por ejemplo, el interior de la taza, y bien sabes que sta rea es "Pi", o sea 3.14159 por el radio al cuadrado A=?(r^2), Si lo que tienes es el dametro, que estoy seguro es ms fcil de obtener, entonces lo divides entre dos, o utilizas la frmula como sigue:    A=?(d^2)/4    Ya el rea sencillamente la multiplicas por la altura, ?y listo! Una frmula condensada te quedar as:    V=?(r^2)h    V=?(d^2)h/4    Donde El volmen es igual al ?("PI") multiplicado por el radio elevado al cuadrado y multiplicado por la altura. O como vimos en el problema del rea, en vez del radio al cuadrado puedes utilizar el dimetro al cuadrado dividido entre cuatro.    V= Volmen  ?=3.14159  r=radio  h=altura    Es necesario que todos los valores estn en la misma escala para que no tengas problemas con tu resultado.

As que un centmetro equivale a 1/100 de metro, o sea 0.01m. Tres veces esta operacin quiere decir que un centmetro cbico es igual a 0.000001m3. Dividistre tres veces entre cien.    Suerte!

Yo imagino algunos casos:    CILINDRO:  Ejemplo: un contenedor de Pringles.    En ese caso debes encontrar el "rea de la base" que es un "crculo" multiplicando "pi" por su "radio" al cuadrado.  El resultado de esta operacin lo multiplicars por la "altura" del cilindro, que en este caso es la distancia que hay entre los dos circulos, el de arriba y el de abajo.    Volumen= (pi)*(radio al cuadrado)*(altura)      ESFERA:  Ejemplo: un baln de ftbol.  En caso de la esfera slo necesitas saber el "dametro" de la esfera. Es decir cunto mide de un lado a otro.  Luego el dimetro lo divides entre dos para encontrar el "radio".  Luego elevas el "radio" al cubo lo multiplicas por "pi".  El resultado lo multiplicas por 4/3.    Volumen = (pi) * (radio al cubo) * 4/3    CONO TRUNCADO:  Ejemplo: un vaso que es ms ancho arriba que abajo.    En este caso tienes que conocer dos radios y una altura.  Un "radio 1" correspondiente al crculo ms peque?o, un "radio 2", correspondiente al circulo ms grande y la "altura", correspondiente a la distancia perpendicular entre los dos crculos.  ES IMPORTANTE que la altura no sea el borde del vaso, sino la distancia en lnea recta entre los centros de los dos crculos.    Volumen =  primero: (radio 1 al cuadrado)+(radio2 al cuadrado)+(radio1 por radio 2)  el resultado anterior lo multiplicars por "pi" luego por la "altura" y al final todo lo divides entre 3.      NOTAS EXPLICATIVAS:    1- Quieres en metros cbicos.  Entonces las medidas las tienes que dar en metros.  Ej. Si mide 120 cm.  debers poner 1.20 que es el equivalente en metros.

The train travels at 48 km/h and the plane travels at 240 km/h.    Thus, we can say that:    48(x+2) = 240x    That is, the amount of time spent on the train (x + 2) times the speed the train was going (48) is equal to the amount of time spent on the plane (x) time the speed of the plane.    This gives:    48x + 96 = 240x.    Solving for x gives 0.5 or half an hour (30 minutes) since are units are in hours.    So, x (time spent on the plane) is .5 hours.  Thus, x + 2 (time spent on train) is 2.5 hours.    Thus, the total travel time is .5 + 2.5 hours or 3 hours in total.|`|Xzs3kdEHaa	I got 5.83- to infinit, i believe that would be the most logic answer.

Please correct me if I'm wrong is just that it's been very long since I had chemistry, but I'm glad to help! :)

7k2c7Xajaa	remember "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" so first thing to be sure about that you don't need to study with no breaks in between.    getting good at math involves one thing which can be difficult sometimes: Work, work and work. it is also important to ask where you have difficulties so as to straighten things out if you have trouble solving a problem. also working maths at your age can prove testing since maths is no longer that simple.    however try to get into a rhythm and start doing your homework and working extra if needed. this may seem like a big challenge but there is no need to panic. try to reward yourself if you have done your homework or studied for example 2 hours. these sort of rewards can be doing things you like or spending quality time with your friends.     take regular but not lengthy breaks when studying maths as it gets "mind tiring" sometimes. exercise can help you relieve much of the stress along with a healthy diet.    hope you get good at maths and this advice helped you clear some things. besides i would like to mention that when studying you can also help yourself by doing a list of the topics you have done and those you have still to do so that you know beforehand if you are short on time or vice-versa

54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Bees go from flower to flower collecting nectar and pollen.  The pollen of each flower sticks to the bee's fuzzy legs, and when they go to the next flower to collect nectar, some of the pollen rubs off in that flower.  Now, this is how a flowering plant makes fruit.  The base of the flower has something called ovaries.  This is where the seeds will grow.  But the ovary cannot make seeds unless it has pollen to fertilize it and start the seeds growing.  The bees bring the pollen to ovaries and so the seeds start to grow.  The seeds in the ovaries are surrounded by the part that will grow into fruit.    The vegetables that grow from flowers are technically fruits, even if we don't call them that.  Tomatoes, peppers, bell peppers, cucumbers, squashes, zucchinis, eggplants, and pumpkins are all fruits and grow from flowers.  Bees and butterflies help to pollinate the flowers so they can grow these fruits.  Even vegetables that we don't eat the fruit of, like cabbage and lettuce and celery, need to make seeds sometimes, so that farmers can plant them and grow more vegetables.   For a lot of fruit and nut trees, the bees are the main pollinators, and there will not be much fruit if there are not bees to pollinate the flowers.  Vegetables, usually, can get along without bees.|`|AA11573840	They spread pollen around to different flowers while collecting it to make honey which essentially makes flowers pregnant and produce more offspring.

nU4ZD47saa	Weil sich durch die W?rme Stoffe ausdehnen, so auch das Metall des Wasserhahns bzw. des Ventils. Dadurch wird bei nur leicht aufgedrehtem Hahn die ?ffnung, durch die sich das Wasser drckt, kleiner. Das funktioniert auch umgekehrt, wenn das Wasser mittels Durchlauferhitzer erw?rmt wird: Wenn man hei?es Wasser laufen l??t, den Hahn dann soweit schlie?t, da? es nur noch tr?pfelt, so da? sich der Durchlauferhitzer abschaltet, kommt irgendwann nur noch kaltes Wasser und der Strahl wird von alleine gr??er.|`|21231b5292f0c1e464c8334ee784ff0aaa	Ganz einfach. Das heisse Wasser dehnt das metallene Material des Wasserhahns erheblich aus. So das auch die ?ffnung des Wasserhahn-Ventils sich dadurch verringert.    Dadurch wird die ?ffnung des Ventils bei ansteigender Hitze immer kleiner und auch ebenso dadurch der Durchlauf der Wassermenge. Hinzu kommt noch, das sich erhitzendes Wasser ausdehnt und langsamer durch eine kleiner werdende ?ffnung l?uft. |`|kYdoa4boaa	Das Wasser wird in den meisten Systemen auf Vorrat erhitzt.

Bei den hei?en Wasser l?sst der Druck zus?tzlich nach da das volumen des in der Leitung enthaltenden Wassers abnimmt.    du weist ja: warme K?rper dehnen sich aus ...  Wenn aber kein warmes Wasser mehr vorhanden, gibt es auch nichts ausgedehntes, das merkt man am nachlassenden Druck.

Fr Metalle liegt der W?rmeausdehnungskoeffizient bei 10^-5 /K. Selbst bei einer Erw?rmung des mit dem flie?ende Wasser in Berhrung kommenden Stempels, der ca 1 cm lang ist, um 100 K, ist die L?ngenausdehnung ca. 10m. Zu wenig um einen Effekt zu haben. Fr die Gummidichtung gilt gleiches.     Bei Str?mungen f?llt mir immer der Bernoulli-Effekt ein. Siehe http://www.wundersamessammelsurium.info/... (unten The Parallel Plate Paradox . Sollte man die Ger?tschaften nicht zu Hand haben, kann man auch zwei Blatt Papier ca. 5 cm auseinander nach unten durchh?ngen lassen und in die ?ffnung pusten. Die Bl?tter ziehen sich an).  Das Zwischen dem Dichtung und dem Korpus des Wasserhahn hindurchstr?mende Wasser zieht beide an. Dies funktioniert auch, allerdings bei sehr geringen ?ffnungen, mit kalten Wasser. Bei warmen Wasser wird die Gummidichtung durch das erw?rmen weicher. Daher gibt sie bei h?heren Temperatur leichter nach. Daher erst das verz?gerte Abdichten.     Ist erstmal abgedichtet bedeutet der geringe Querschnitt der ?ffnung (siehe oberstes Bild in den Link), einen geringen Wasserdruck in der Engstelle, der nicht ausreicht, die Oberfl?chenspannung des Wassers zum berwinden. Selbst wenn das Gummi wieder abkhlt, damit steifer wird und sich daher zurckzieht, bleibt der Hahn eine zeitlang dicht.     Man kann nun eine Position suchen, bei der beim Abkhlen der Spalt zwischen Korpus und Dichtung beim soweit wieder ?ffnet, dass ein geringer Durchflu? entsteht. Dann geht das Spiel wieder von vorne los und man hat einen mal dichten, mal undichten Hahn....    Dass das ganze was ich geschrieben habe, kein v?lliger Bl?dsinn ist kann man dadurch feststellen, dass wenn man einen Wasserhahn langsam ?ffnet natrlich irgendwann das Wasser zu fliesen beginnt. Wenn es fliesst, kann man etwas zurckdrehen, ohne dass der Wasserfluss ausbleibt. Einfach deshalb, weil das Wasser an Ende es Kanals zwischen Dichtung und Korpus keine Grenzfl?che zur Luft bildet, daher auch keine Oberfl?chenspannung sich gegen den Wasserdruck stemmt.      @Jayman: Bei Deiner Antwort erscheinen mir zwei Argumente unphysikalisch.  1. Staudruck. Dieser liebt bei Str?mung vor dem Ventil an. Er beeinflu?t jedoch nicht wesentlich den Druck im Ventil. Der dynamische Staudruck liget immer vor, wenn etwas an eine Engstelle str?mt. Wieso sollter der wegfallen? Oder meintest Du den hydrostatischen Druck? Der bleibt erhalten!  2. Druckabnahme durch Erw?rmung. Oberhalb von 4C dehnt sich Wasser bei Erw?rmung aus. Folge ist eine Druckerh?hung. Fr eine Warmwasseraufbereitung auf dem Dach und Versorgung durch Eigengewicht, verstehe ich, das bei warmen Wasser der hydrostatische Druck aufgrund der geringeren Dichte auch geringer ist. Jedoch steht in aller Regel - auch bei Warmwasserbereitung durch Solarkollektoren - der Warmwasserbeh?lter im Keller und die Versorgung mit Warmwasser erledigt eine Umw?lzpumpe, die konstanten Druck liefert. Das warme Wasser setzt dem einen geringeren hydrostatischen Druck entgegen, also gibt es oben mehr Druck=Pumpendruck - hydrostatische Druck.|`|fMTgMKjraa	Hmmm......diese Frage au?gerechnet von Dir?  8 - )  Na, das Wasser drckt doch gegen die ?ffnung vom Wasserhahn. Da hat es den meisten Druck, der vom Wasser dahinter kommt.   Wenn man dann den Hahn aufdreht, normalisiert sich der Druck, weil das Wasser dann im konstanten Flu? herausstr?mt & nicht aufgehalten wird.

This is actually easy to understand because it's quite like our calendar which has cycles of various sizes very familiar to us. For example there is a:        * 1 Jan every year      * day 1 every month      * Monday every week      * 1am every day    The Mayan cycles were a bit more complex, such that every day in a 52 year period had a unique name from a combination of various different cycles (similar to the idea that there is a Monday 1st January only every 7 years or so). This 52 year cycle has is called a Calendar Round. To keep track of dates on longer time scales the Mayans then had what's known as the Long Count, which provides a unique numerical indicator for each day. Mayans did not count in base ten like we did, but usually instead in base 20 (although not always). The Mayan long count can be summarized as:     days Mayan count  1  1 kin  20  20 kin  1 uinal  360  360 kin  18 uinal  1 tun  7200  7200 kin  360 uinal 20 tun 1 kactun  144000  144000 kin  8000 uinal  400 tun  20 kactun  1 bactun    The name for a Mayan epoch apparently translates as 13 bactuns, which you can see is 13*144000 days or 5125.26 years (roughly). There is actually some minor disagreement over when the current Mayan long cycle started, but it was probably either August 11th or 13th 3114 BC, which means it comes to an end on either Dec 21st or 23rd 2012.    As I mentioned above the Mayan calendar was designed to be cyclical, so the fact that the long count comes to an end in Dec 2012, while having some significance for the Maya as the end of a great cycle (much like we celebrated the millennium (incorrectly as it happens) on Dec 31st 1999), does not mean that the "world will come to an end". It's actually true that there are Mayan names for periods of time longer than 13 bactuns, so that their calendar doesn't even end then, and even if it did there is no evidence to suggest that they (or anyone for that matter) have any special knowledge about the end of the world.    There are however a lot of theories knocking around the Internet which use the end of this calendar cycle to predict the end of the world. They often also mention the fact that Dec 21st is the winter solstice, and that the Sun on the solstice that year is "aligned" with the plane of the galaxy. On the winter solstice, the Sun always has a Declination of -23.5 degrees, and a Right Ascension of 18 hours, but exactly where this is on the sky relative to more distant stars changes very slowly due to the "precession of the equinoxes". We have a posted answer explaining this effect but how it's important in this answer (and how it was first noticed) is by the fact that it moves the position of the equinoxes, and solstices with a period of 26,000 years in a complete circle around the sky westward along the ecliptic. So the position of the winter solstice moves 360 degrees in 26,000 years. That means that it moves 360/26000 = 0.01 degrees a year. Defining an exact boundary for the plane of the Milky Way is tough, but it's at least 10-20 degrees wide across much of the sky, meaning that the solstice can be described as being "in the plane of the Milky Way" for 700-1400 years! To put it another way, the winter solstice that just past (2005) was only 0.1 degrees away from where it will be in 2012, a distance smaller than the size of the Sun itself (which is about 0.5 degrees in diameter). In any case the Sun crosses the plane of the Galaxy twice every year as we orbit around it, with no ill effect on Earth.    To conclude:        * The Mayan calendar does not predict the end of the world on Dec 12th 2012.           1. The exact date of the end of the current Mayan Long Count is still a matter of debate amongst Mayan scholars, although it is likely to be around Dec 21 2012.           2. The Mayan calendar is cyclical, and there are names for cycles longer than 13 bactuns of the Long Count which are coming to an end in 2012.        Even if the Mayans did believe that the world would come to an end at the end of the Long Count (which I don't believe is true), there is no reason to assume that they have any special knowledge which would allow them to make this prediction correctly. You are free to believe the Sun won't come up tomorrow, but it will anyway....        * The fact that the winter solstice on 2012 is "aligned" with the plane of the Galaxy has no significance.           1. It takes the winter solstice 700-1400 years to cross the plane of the Galaxy.           2. The solstice last year (2005) was within 0.1 degrees (or 1/5th the size of the Sun) of where it will be on 2012.           3. The Sun crosses the plane of the Milky Way twice every year with no ill effect.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	Neither the Mayans nor the Egyptians predicted the end of the world.  Not for 2012, not for any date.    ---    The whole thing began as astrologers noticed that a point called the winter solstice was crossing the Milky Way (and the Galactic equator).    Astrologers being those who believe that the sky runs our lives, decided that this "event" must mean something special. In a way, this is strange as astrologers have generally ignored the Galactic equator (being a recent invention, it was not part of the "classical" astrology).    So they made "New Age"-type predictions (a new chance for humanity, more peace, brotherly love among the nations, etc.).    Still, not much was made of it, because a lot of our Western Civilization "New Age" stuff is normally based on the Spring Equinox moving through the constellations (e.g., we are moving from the age of Pisces to the age of Aquarius).    We (western civilization) had no reason to pay attention to the Winter Solstice.  Until...    ---    Later, someone found that the Mayans had a day-count calendar that reaches a round figure on a date somewhat in the general area of the "event" (even though the "event", described above, does not happen in 2012).    And this date, in the Mayan calendar, had a direct link with the Winter Solstice. On the day we call 2012.12.21, the Mayan calendar reaches the round figure 13.00.00.00.00 in their counting system.    This is not surprising, since the day of Winter solstice was, every year, New Year's Day for the Mayans. If you are setting up a calendar with an important round figure, you fix it so that it falls on New Year's Day. Big celebration. Lots of cake.    "Well", someone thought "this must be an important date that is linked with the event we described earlier". Because of the link to the Winter Solstice. This is where Jos A. came in to the act.    So the New Age predictions started again. Except, this time, some hoaxers got into it and decided to crank up the scare factor. (Some people just love to scare others, just for the fun of it)    This is when began the lies about the Mayan calendar "ending" (it does not) or the Mayans having predicted the end-of-the-world (they did not).    From that point on, there seemed to be a contest, which I have called the Big 2012 Hoax Off, as to who could come up with the biggest boldfaced lie and still get people to believe it.    All this had begun quite some time ago but we did not hear about it until the year 2000 had passed (Y2k -- the Year 2000 end-of-civilization -- had distracted us from these other lies).    ---    Meanwhile, another group had predicted the end-of-the-world for the year 2003. You see, there was to be this Planet X coming close to us, causing earthquakes, tsunamis, even pole flips.  "Nancy L." had been told all this by some aliens from a planet around Zeta Reticuli (some star in the small constellation Reticulum).    Yeah! Right!    Charlatans associated with Nancy had a book for sale on how to survive the end-of-the-world of 2003.    Well, 2003 came and went, and many of us actually managed to survive the end-of-the-world... and we had not even bought their book.    So they revised the book, they changed the date to 2012 (already made popular by astrologers and by Jos). They added Nibiru and Nemesis (two more fictitious bodies) to their Planet X, and they created fake documentaries for YouTube and for television.    The matching 2012 "predictions" by Nostradamus, the Bible, the Egyptians and so on, were also created after 2003 (otherwise, they would have contradicted the 2003 end-of-the-world prediction).    You have to admit that the marketing is far better for 2012 than it was for 2003. A lot more people are talking about the 2012 end-of-the-world than they were about the 2003 end-of-the-world.    But it is still fake.|`|LRH9Em0yaa	What Donut tim is saying, NO it will not happen =3, Look go to http://www.universetoday.com and click on the 2012 Category, NOTHING will happen, And stop posting in the Astro section D= Post it in the Mythology.|`|OGw6Upv8aa	no.    i have it on very good authority that the world ended last week but we've all been too hung over to notice.|`|qDYzdz5daa	Absolutely, 100% NOT.    It's garbage.    Everything you have heard about 2012 is full of half-truths and outright lies, with the following exceptions.    1. There will be an American presidential election in 2012.  2. The Summer Olympics will be in London in 2012.  3. The Planet Venus will transit the Sun in 2012. (The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.    That is all. Everything else is bull.    The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012."     (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)    December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY civilizations. And that's ALL. They just had different ways of counting the years.    All the other predictions, "pole shifts" (which take thousands of years to even start) "galactic alignments" (a lie, we're far above the galactic plane and moving away from it, "killer planet Nibiru' (physically impossible) and everything else, are completely and totally made-up.|`|NgUbzaF9aa	Do you know how many times "doomsday" has been predicted?

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

There were many philosophers in Greece at the time, and each one was popular in his City.    Greek people were not much bothered by scientific evidence.  They usually went along with whoever was the most popular and the most eloquent.    In matters of astronomy, those were Archimedes and Ptolemy.    They were so popular that when Cleanthes (of the Stoics) heard about the teachings of Aristachus, he wanted him banned. (Today, we'd say he wanted to prosecute him for spreading falsehoods).    But we do not know exactly when Aristarchus proposed his model.  In fact, the very few writings we have about it come from others (e.g., Archimedes).

Depending at what level you are working at you may also need to indicate the oxidation state (charge on the metal ion) for elements that have more than one oxidation state. This is done by inserting the oxidation state in brackets using roman numerals between the metal and nitrate. eg Iron (II) nitrate

mH1Tnv5Naa	The technical answer is that it starts as a weak area of low pressure residing over warm tropical waters with showers and thunderstorms near the center.  As the showers and thunderstorms become more concentrated around the center, more and more heat gets released by the massive amounts of condensation of water vapor.  That release of heat is what powers the hurricane.  That warms the air and lowers the central pressure, which in turn increases the storm activity...even more condensation...more heat...you can see how it builds on itself. Eventually the amount of heat energy available becomes processed to the max and the hurricane tops out in strength.|`|X9iZA9svaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_K...    go to this site and it will tell you everything about it|`|QWky1BgDaa	They form over the sea when the water temperature is at least is 26C.

It is as simle as this: if you make something half of its original size, then you would have to double the size of the new thing to get it back to its original size.  An example: a sheet of paper is 8.5 X 11 inches in size. If you 'shrink' the paper to half of its originl size, you will get a piece of paer that is now only 4.25 X 5.5 inches in size. To get the original size piece of paper back, you have to double the size of the 4.25 X 5.5 piece of paper to make it be 8.5 X 11 again.  In mathematical terms, you could write the proportionality equation for this as    (new size / original size) = 1 / 2    (4.25 X 5.5) / (8.5 X 11) = 1 / 2    To go backwards, now you have to reassign what is the new size and what is the old size. The old size will always be the size you start with and we want the new size to be the original size, so we could write    (8.5 X 11) / (4.25 X 5.5) = 2 / 1    If you look carefully, you will see that to reduce the size we multiplied the dimensions by 1/2, but to reverse the process we divided the dimensions by 1/2 (dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 2, be sure you understand why...)    Same thing with your copier question. To reduce the original size to 78% you multiplied by 0.78 to get the new size. Now to get back to the original size, you have to divide the reduced size by the same amount, 0.78.  To figure out what percentage this is, for the answer to your question, you must just calculate (1 / 0.78) as a percentage.  That is, do the calculation (1 divided by 0.78) times 100...|`|6V4MBBzMaa	22% ??|`|NNWerE4Jaa	100%, the copy when it started was 100% then rduced to 78... it has to be 100% to make it it's original standard size!|`|ZdZlNAa2aa	You need to work out what percentage of 78, 22 is.

The size of the original document is 1, reduced to .78, and you want to get it back to 1.    So all you need to do is write the equation .78 * x = 1.    so x = 1/.78 = 1.28    Thus, the reduced document must be enlarged about 28% from the reduced size, to get it back to its original size.|`|aFr3kqYYaa	the question is basically asking what size is the original and what percentage should you make it larger by.  100 take away 78 is how you get the answer; it comes to 22%|`|nXt3Gsq0aa	yes 128- 129 %    ex  if its 20 inches     20 X .78 =            15.6 inches   now to get it back to 20  15.6 x 1.28 = 19.968  15.6 X 1.29 = 20.124  so somewhere between 128-129 %|`|x6y8qN1Jaa	you need to enlarge the copy by 128.2%  78 * 1.282 = 100.    see working mans explanation.|`|43H7uNcTaa	128%    If you just choose 100%, you'll get another 78% copy.

So the second day he travels 75km/h for 8 hours so that means the total for the second day is 75x8 or 600km (the hours cancel out). So then to find the total distance you have traveled you add the first days distance and the second days distance: 350km+600km= 950km    So he is 950km away from home...    Hope I helped!

InPqgS6daa	Gamma is not a particle, rather it is called a ray. So gamma rays are absorbed the least because they are not particles and hence has no mass or charge even. That is a reason they are absorbed the least and can easily penetrate through most things. X ray which mostly behaves like the gamma rays due to similar properties can easily pass through the human body to produce X ray images. What they cannot pass through are the bones because bones contain calcium ions and this is something that stops them from penetrating. As a result, they pass through the flesh but since cannot pass through the bones, so leave back an imprint of the image.

But I suppose the answer for this case would be A.|`|C3LiKhm8aa	C is the preferred answer, probably, but there are other considerations.    If the machinery is new and is replacing labor, then there may well be an improvement in the efficiency of the plant, so that the per unit cost of production goes down, which would lower the cost.    If the machinery is merely replacing a used up machine, with no increase in productivity, then the cost will rise.    If raw material cost goes up, the cost of production will rise.

HyUE9ON0aa	Motel is an establishment that provides lodging for motorists in rooms usually having direct access to an open parking area. Also called motor court, motor lodge.    @@@@@@@@@@@@2      Urban sprawl, cross-country conferences, and Las Vegas extravaganzas are each associated with hotels, but a motel is where you might stay if traveling with your family through the Sequoia National Forest, the vast Montana countryside, or the sweet woods of Virginia. Motels are roadside lodgings that are often quaint and privately owned, though motel chains also exist. Motels first appeared along the highways of America not long after Henry Ford started rolling Model Ts off the assembly line, from 1908 to 1930. Tin Lizzy, as it was called, was the first affordable car offered to the masses. Once people got a set of wheels, they wanted to use them, and the humble motel sprang up to help motoring folks get from point A to point B.    One of the distinguishing features of a motel is that it is U-shaped or square, with an inner courtyard that serves as the parking lot. Doors face the lot, with ground doors opening directly to their own parking spaces mere feet away. This is extremely convenient for unloading suitcases. It is also reassuring to have your vehicle parked right outside the door where you can keep an eye on it, especially if it contains valuables.    Hotels serve a different purpose than motels, and as such, they are located in or near cities. The basic design of a motel differs significantly from hotels, where rooms face inward with doors opening to interior hallways. A guest might stay at a hotel for a week or longer on business or pleasure, and extras are expected. Hotels commonly offer Jacuzzis, gyms, pools, restaurants, room service, cable television, Internet connectivity, and other luxuries. Hotel parking lots are separate, and in many cases, the walk from the lot to the lobby can be a trek. Some hotels provided shuttle service.     While the average motel may not have the accoutrements found at hotels, it offers easy access, reasonable rates, and a less complicated experience. This makes a motel ideal for a nights sleep as travelers make their way through the countrys less traveled roads to an ultimate destination. Some motels even feature individual cabins set among picturesque woods, perfect for a longer stay to get away from it all.    Motel 6 is one of the largest motel chains in the United States, offering an experience somewhat similar to that of a budget hotel. Motel 6s are multi-story chains with direct access parking and are usually located just off a freeway or highway for convenience. The more typical motel is found in mountain towns and along smaller, more picturesque highways.|`|O9FojdEMaa	it is an abbreviation for Motor Hotel.|`|im0OsH78aa	Motel spelled backwards is Letom.

Some of the C)2 will dissolve into the water, but the majority of the C)2 will escape to the air above the solution    So the solution decreased in mass because the NaCHO3 which had the CO2 locked up in the solid, now is released as a gas that floats away.

Based on the details you will know the concentration of vinegar(i.e, the acetic acid), so you'll know the amount of HCO3 and you'll know the amount of CO2.    Your formula tells you that 1 mol NaHCO3 -> 1 mol HCO3 - > 1 mol CO2...in other words, 1 mol of product will require 1 mol of reactant.  So convert CO2 into moles and work backwards to find mol NaHCO3 and then convert NaHCO3 into grams.

9Wi2eNInaa	You have to look at what type of inverter you are using to cut the sinusoidal wave down to the square wave. Each inverter style cuts the wave down in trying to balance current with voltage.    Look at this link:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Square...     Using Fourier analysis, periodic waveforms are represented as the sum of an infinite series of sine waves. The sine wave that has the same frequency as the original waveform is called the fundamental component. The other sine waves, called harmonics, that are included in the series have frequencies that are integral multiples of the fundamental frequency.    The quality of the inverter output waveform can be expressed by using the Fourier analysis data to calculate the total harmonic distortion (THD). The total harmonic distortion is the square root of the sum of the squares of the harmonic voltages divided by the fundamental voltage:    THD = {\sqrt{V_2^2 + V_3^2 + V_4^2 + .... + V_n^2} \ V_1}    The quality of output waveform that is needed from an inverter depends on the characteristics of the connected load. Some loads need a nearly perfect sine wave voltage supply in order to work properly. Other loads may work quite well with a square wave voltage.|`|yxnUBSJqaa	Sinusoidal PWM is not occurring.  The sinusoidal waveform is at a certain frequency that you can select.  The default I'm assuming would be line frequency or 60 Hz.  A square wave is a form of sinusoidal waveform with harmonics introduced to make it a square wave.  From the sine wave input, its converted to a square wave.  You have a modulator circuit that modulates the square wave to produce the desired result.  The amplitude is the peak-to-peak value of the waveform which would be constant unless something was wrong with your circuit.|`|KxpVOYrPaa	if u want to use pwm to control a dc motor u need to use a controller which what labview is doing for u.  usualy labview output is 5V logic but the motor cannot run with 5V logic signal so that u need to use a switching device that can be switched on and off using 5V and can control higher power the best device can do that is the MOSFET, remember u need to put a diode across the mosfet to protect the mosfet from back ward current form the motor.    i am doing similar project but i am using the PWM to control 3 phase ac motor.|`|pBSKTPJhaa	PL.

You should use FinalVelocity=InitialVelocity + Acceleration*Time. you should be able to plug all the knowns and unknowns and solve for Time.  This time will be from 3m up from the water up to the max height of the diver.      Now you have time, use the equation   Displacement=1/2(initialvelocity + finalvelocity) * Time  You should be able to solve for displacement, add it to 3m and you will have your max height    2.) you have the time from 3m to the max height, now you need to find out the time from max height to water.    Use equation displacement  = (initialvelocity * time) + (0.5Acceleration * Time^2)  displacement is going to be your max height answer from part 1  initialvelocity is 0  acceleration is -9.8m/s^2  Solve for Time.  Add the time from part one to the time you just solved for and that should be your total time airborne.

The ideal gas law works because it assumes there is enough distance between the molecules that the size of the molecules does not matter and that when they collide, there are no attractive or repulsion forces between the molecules.    For this reason, the equation PV = nRT holds or to restate it in terms of mass (m = molar mass, g/mole):    PV = nRT X m    Therefore, solve for density in terms of mass/unit volume:    n x m/V = p/RT    At STP, the pressure and the temperature and the volume are constant, and R is a constant, so the density  can be calculated from the molar mass.|`|Y4VbvnfCaa	Because we know the molar volume of a gas.

mH1Tnv5Naa	The light does not capture information.  What happens is that the light impacts our eyeballs and is focused onto the back of the retina, which is lined with various types of cells such as  rods and cones, which react to the characteristics of the light (how intense, what wavelength, etc.) The reactions of those cells result in a signal being sent through the optic nerve to the seeing portion of the brain.  The brain interprets the combined signals to produce the result which we call "seeing".  Imperfections in the eye structures can cause the light to either be reduced or blocked, or fail to be properly focused onto the back of the eye.  This in turn creates an incomplete signal to the brain, which we consciously perceive as blurred vision or other problem.

Basically its one of the following:     1) two different alleles at a locus are responsible for different phenotypes.  2) two alleles that affect the phenotype of the heterozygote. For instance ab blood groups|`|ry3Yw86Jaa	A gene with codominant expression is one where the phenotype will be a mix of both alleles.       OK, so an example will help immensely, I think.      The classic example of codominant gene expression is snapdragons.  So you have a red snap dragon and you have a white snap dragon.  You breed them and grow up the next generation, waiting on pins and needles to see them flower.  Now, according to a dominant/recessive expression, you'd expect the next generation of such a pairing to be made up of some percentage of red individuals and white individuals.  But not so with codominant expression, the result of this cross is pink flowered offspring- perfectly intermediate of the two alleles.  Codominant expression is nice because it allows us to know the genotypes without having to much around with all sorts of back crosses and so forth.  So in this example lets call the red allele R and the white allele r.  The red individuals are RR, the white are rr and the pink homozygotes are Rr.  We know this because each allele is expressed and makes itself known in the phenotype.  So when we see a red snapdragon, we know it has two copies of the R allele, if it didn't it would be pink.    Hope that helps clear things up!

Chances are when it was made at the factory one of the wires was draped across and resting on the metal instead of being held up away from any metal (potentially hot) surfaces.    Probably over time your insulation on one of those wires got cooked to many times and the insulation got brittle and cracked off and shorted against the metal frame of your stove.

One significant figure per number, numbers written in scientific notation draw their sig. figs. from the number being multiplied by a power of 10, not 10. 3 and 4 both have one sig fig, ergo the answer will also have one.    Your base is right, your power is not. It should be 2e8 (division of powers is like subtracting them)    2e2 is the next one, 12.4e5 / 6.2e3 = 2e2.    69,000,000,000 = 6.9e10. Base must be between 0 and 10 exclusively. Negative powers denote decimals. 69e-9 = 0.0000000069    The problem with 14 is the same as in 11, you added the power 2 to the power 29, when it should be subtracted. So the answer should be 2e27.    15: The power is right, the base should only have 1 sig fig.|`|AA11915874	*** 10 ***  (3 X 10^3) (4X10^23) = 3x4 x 10^(3+23) = 12x10^26 = 1x10^27...1 sig fig.    this has 1 sig fig because you are multiplying two numbers.  when multiplying or dividing two numbers your answer can only have as many sig figs as the number with the least sig figs.   since 3x10^3 and 4x10^23 both have 1 sig fig, your final answer can only have 1 sig fig.    as to exponents.... you add exponents.  10^3 x 10^23 = 10^26... 12x10^26 = 1.2x10^27....you wrote 10^28?   why?    *** 11 ***    (9x10^9) / (4.5x10^1) = (9 / 4.5) x 10^(9-1) = 2 x10^8.... again 1 sig fig...    and when dividing, you subtract exponents... FYI.. adding and subtracting exponents only works if the base is the same... it is "10" in this case...10^9 / 10^1 = 10^8... ok?  5^9 / 6^1  5^8....ok?    *** 12 ***  1.24x10^6 / 6.2 x 10^3 = (1.24 / 6.2) x 10^(6-3) = 0.20 x 10^3 = 2.0 x10^2    can you see why?   1.24 has 3 sig figs.  6.2 has 2 sig figs.  so the answer can only have 2 sig figs.  0.20 and 2.0 both have 2 sig figs.  in 0.20... the first 0 is NOT a sig fig.  the zero after the 2 is.  in 2.0, the 0 is significant.    *** 13 ***  69,000,000,000 = 6.9 x 10^10    this needs a discussion.... the zeros between the right most non zero integer and the decimal point may or may not be significant.  ie.. the zeros between 9 and the decimal point.   if there is another 0 or another non zero digit after the decimal point, they are.  ie 69,000,000,000.0 has 12 sig figs.  to distinguish significant zeros from non significant zeros in this problem we usually place a "_" above the last significant zero.  69,00,000,000... has 5 sig figs.... all the zeros to the right of the  are NOT significant.  ok?    so you could say this problem is ambiguous but you should try 6.9 x 10^10 as a solution...    *** 14 ***  (4x10^5) (6x10^23) / 1.2x10^2 = (4 x 6 / 1.2) x 10^(5+23-2) =   20x10^26 = 2 x 10^27    again, we are multiplying and dividing so the final answer can only have as many sig figs as the least number in the factors.  4x10^5 has 1 sig fig....6x10^23 has 1 sig fig...1.2x10^2 has 2 sig figs.  the least is "1" so we can only have 1 in the final answer    *** 15 ***  this could mean 1 of two things.  either...    (7x10^-8) / [(3x10^4) (5x10^5)]   or  [(7x10^-8) / (3x10^4)] x  (5x10^5)    ie either the (5x10^5) is in the numerator or in the denominator... you have to decide....    (7x10^-8) / [(3x10^4) (5x10^5)] = (7 / (3x5)) x 10^(-8-4-5) = 0.5 x 10^-17 = 5 x 10^-18... 1 sig fig...    or    [(7x10^-8) / (3x10^4)] x  (5x10^5) = (7 x 5 / 3) x 10^(-8-4+5) = 12x10^-7 = 1.2x10^-6 = 1x10^-6 with 1 sig fig...    either way, the answer can only have 1 sig fig.  7 has 1 sig fig. 3 has 1 sig fig... 5 has 1 sig fig...ok?|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	Do your own homework.

NUKWB93naa	Of course no one has been below the earth's crust. At the thinnest points it's still thousands of feet thick and once you got to the bottom there would be nothing there to meet you but molten rock. So, not much to see. You're basically right about how scientists (geophysicists) study and understand the interior of the earth. Waves from earthquakes, especially from strong ones, allow them to map the interior in great detail.    You are misinterpreting a basic tenet of science (kind of). Scientific laws are not common because scientists always operate with the assumption that new evidence can prove a theory wrong. However, when a particular theory has been held for a long time and is reinforced again and again, the word theory is often dropped although the word law is seldom applied.    Physics is a good example of the application of laws. With all the data and a few calculations anyone can exactly predict the path of a projectile, the drag on a car, or any number of other things. So we call those laws. But, those simple laws no longer work when we get close to edge of a black hole (quantum physics).    So, if we stick to the earth, the equations and constants used to map the interior do not change. They are defined by physics and are subject to the laws of time, space, and gravity found here on the earth (not on a black hole). Those equations and constants are just tools we use to measure and observe. They help us define the evidence. An example would be a doctor using a microscope to view a sample from his patient. The microscope doesn't change with a new patient, but the sample sure does. The math used to evaluate the earth is just like that scope.    The best data seismologists and geophysists get about the earth's interior is from earthquakes. Also, they find new ways to apply their own skills in math (way over my head). Knowing that, it is very possible that our current understanding and theory of the earth could change. A major quake in an area that hasn't seen one in a hundred years could occur. Combine that with some new applied math and observers could change their minds about the layers and composition of the earth.    Part of what makes science great is that every hypothesis, theory, and even law is constantly being tested, analyzed and evaluated. There is no room to hide a bad idea because someone will come along and find you out.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	We know that the inner core of the earth is solid and the outer core is liquid due to how different types of seismic waves behave as they travel through the earth.Theb waves act differently when travelling though solids and liquids and the waves can be tracked as they travel across and though the earth.   That is how we know what the interior of the earth is like

2dbaca97333e2524ca5ce0c5326a9319aa	GOOD QUESTION MAN..    READ THE FOLLWING WITH PATIENCE:    The circumference of the Earth at the equator is 25,000 miles. The Earth rotates in about 24 hours. Therefore, if you were to hang above the surface of the Earth at the equator without moving, you would see 25,000 miles pass by in 24 hours, at a speed of 25000/24 or just over 1000 miles per hour.     Multiply by cosine of your latitude to see how fast the Earth is rotating where you are.     Earth is also moving around the Sun at about 67,000 miles per hour.       The Earth rotates once in a few minutes under a day (23 hours 56 minutes 04. 09053 seconds). This is called the sidereal period (which means the period relative to stars). The sidereal period is not exactly equal to a day because by the time the Earth has rotated once, it has also moved a little in its orbit around the Sun, so it has to keep rotating for about another 4 minutes before the Sun seems to be back in the same place in the sky that it was in exactly a day before.     An object on the Earth's equator will travel once around the Earth's circumference (40,075.036 kilometers) each sidereal day. So if you divide that distance by the time taken, you will get the speed. An object at one of the poles has hardly any speed due to the Earth's rotation. (A spot on a rod one centimeter in circumference for example, stuck vertically in the ice exactly at a pole would have a speed of one centimeter per day!). The speed due to rotation at any other point on the Earth can be calculated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude of the point. (If you are not familiar with cosines, I wouldn't worry about that now, but if you can find a pocket calculator which has a cosine button you might like to try taking the cosine of your own latitude and multiplying that by the rotation speed at the equator to get your own current speed due to rotation!).     The Earth is doing a lot more than rotating, although that is certainly the motion we notice most, because day follows night as a result. We also orbit the Sun once a year. The circumference of the Earth's orbit is about 940 million kilometers, so if you divide that by the hours in a year you will get our orbital speed in kilometers per hour. We are also moving with the Sun around the center of our galaxy and moving with our galaxy as it drifts through intergalactic space!

I think the answer to your question is inertia.  Things in motion remain in motion, and things at rest remain at rest unless acted upon by a force.  When you are in Japan, you, and everything around you, are traveling east at about 1000 miles per hour.  Leaving the ground in a helicopter and going straight up doesn't change the inertia you and the helicopter and the ground beneath you have.  You are still traveling 1000 miles per hour toward the east, as is everything around you.  You will remain motionless with respect to the ground, and when the helicopter lands, you will still be in Japan.    Think about the Concorde, the supersonic airplane that flew from London to New York.  When flying from London to New York, it took tremendous amounts of energy to remain approximately motionless while the earth spun beneath it and New York approached the Concorde.    If the laws of physics could be so easily broken by simply going up in a helicopter, don't you think everyone would be doing it?

5098cd689ccc53eee0f12d6e783c60a0aa	Yes, soles are made having more surface area. If this is not done then you would keep slipping everywhere. Actually, the increased friction works to your advantage. When you walk forward, u actually put force backwards. The equal and opposite force causes u to move forward(according to Newton's third law of motion). Now, if you think carefully, u'll find that the best way to have maximum forward motion is to increase the amount of force applied in backward direction as it will cause more forward force. The simplest way to increase the amount of contact with the surface as it cause more friction, and friction also is a form of force which acts in the parallel direction (ie in backward direction). Now, it should be clear that the more the friction, the lesser amount of force required. Also, if there hadn't been enough friction then the force you apply in backward direction will not be transfered to the surface and a result ,u would trip down.|`|73f1f3775ff0acd290d1ac37f4549704aa	Because 1) the surfaces you walk on are often not smooth (concrete, for example), and the ridges in soles fit this more securely. 2) Even if the surface is smooth (like a BBall court), there is dirt and other particles - if your soles were smooth, you would just slip; with ridges, a greater pressure is applied over a smaller total area, so they slip less.  3) If it's wet, ridges provide a place for the water to go (in between ridges) so that your soles can contact the floor- otherwise you'd slip.|`|e099cb8b8b2069d4b480904fdfd0ea53aa	Probably to compensate for the arch of our feet for maximum comfort.

cff15c1430c57bf7fd07d037045ba112aa	Here ya go!...    http://wings.avkids.com/Book/Animals/int...    The Mechanics of Flight in Birds     The shape of a wing is called an airfoil. As the airfoil moves through the air, air goes above and below. The air flow over the upper surface has to move farther than the lower part of the wing. In order for the 2 air flows to make it to the edge of the wing at the same time, the top air must go faster.         wing diagram     This is the findings of Bernoulli, a scientist: the air on the upper part has a lower pressure than the air moving over the lower part. This pressure difference makes the lifting possible by the wing.     There is another way to get the most lift. The bird can make "slots". Birds can move their feathers at their wing tips to produce slots.     Speed is the most important part in making lift. Speed can be greater by increasing the forward speed of the wing itself as it travels through the air. If you double the speed, the bird gets 4 times the lift. If the bird triples the speed it will get 9 times the lift.     The bird makes its speed by flapping its wings. This forward motion is called thrust. A bird's wing is like the arm of a man. It is the "hand" part of the wing that makes the power to move the bird through the air. The structure of the bird's wing can be folded close to its body when it is not in flight. But when the wing is stretched out it is both the wing and propeller for the bird. The feathers attached to the " hand" bones are the ones that make the forward thrust for the bird.     Try moving your arms really fast. Then turn your arms as you move them. More air motion happens as you twist your arms. This is how it works with a bird. The bird does this motion in an instant. It took man a long time to find out this secret. When man could see this motion with a slow motion camera it helped us.     Gliding Flight     Some birds can glide and soar for hours. Eagles and vultures glide for miles. How? If the power does not come from their wings, where does it come from?     Birds take advantage of upward movements of air called thermals. These birds are resting on piles of air that are moving upward. Many birds find these thermals and use them for the upward push they give. These birds are gliding downward on a constantly rising current of air.         vulture     Warm air does not rise from the ground in an even manner. This air is shaped more like doughnuts piled up on one another. Riding thermals are great energy savers for birds when they can find them. But they do not always happen. The sun has to heat the ground enough for thermals to happen. Many large birds wait on the ground until 10 o'clock in the morning for the thermals to form.     There are other kinds of updrafts also. Obstruction currents are made when moving air runs into an object like a cliff, mountain, or tall building. The air is forced up and over the object. Birds can "ride" these currents. Birds by the ocean can also glide and soar using trade winds. These winds give a source of power which the birds can glide on. This is called dynamic soaring.     Take Off and Landing     The time in any flight of the greatest danger is during take off and landing. This is because speed is related to the lift needed to leave the ground. Lift is the weakest at take off because full speed has not been made. And at landing because the speed of the bird is being reduced.     The size of the wing is what determines how much lift is made. The angle at which the wing approaches the air affects lift. This increases the air speed over the wing and produces more lift. Birds use all of these: changing their wing size, lowering flaps, opening slots, using winds, and increasing their speed by flapping their wings faster. Larger birds have a harder time getting into the air. They need a strong wind or they land on cliffs so they can leap off to begin their next flight.     The funniest take off and landing is made by the "Gooney Bird". They run, flap, and hop. With the head wind they make it into the air. To land the gooney bird "starts falling". It crash lands on its nose!     Landing is harder than takeoff. The bird must end his flight slowly. First, the bird slows its wing beats. Next, gravity begins to pull the bird down. Then the bird twists its wing to increase the surface area of the wing. This makes more lift to slow the birds landing.     At the same time, the whole wing is moved slightly at the shoulders to increase the angle of landing. This makes more lift as the speed is slowed. This prevents the bird from dropping too fast. And last, the tail is spread open and lowered to act as a brake.     Variety in flight     Birds live all over the earth. There are many types of birds. Some are large, some are small. The larger birds fly faster. There is a great variety in speeds at which birds fly.     The top speed of a bird depends on its design. The vulture flaps its wing once per second. A small bird flaps its wings 4 times per second. The hummingbird flaps its wings 10 times per second and flies at 60 mph. Every bird can change their speed, but has a top speed during flight.         peregrine falcon     The fastest bird is the peregrine falcon. It flies at 100 mph in level flight. When it folds its wings against its body, the falcon can dive at 200 mph.     Some birds do not fly very much. They spend most of their time on the ground. These birds are designed for protection on the ground. They are the grouse, pheasant, and quail (as examples).     Most birds do not fly faster or higher than is needed. This is because it takes too much energy to climb against the gravity. Also, there i|`|AA10614579	they really dont just flap up and down... well they do but when they do it they can adjust their wings and control wich way the thrust is going.. kinda like the rotor blades on the tail of a helicopter that help it spin left or right ...|`|fc8f9c10db77f24e1ae8952a21929c94aa	ask the birds

For some, there just isn't enough data to figure out what the object was - but there has yet to be a single sighting that produced irrefutable evidence of alien spacecraft.

Step 2 -- determine the distance that the raft has travelled while the stone was falling to the water    Distance = 6.60 - 4.70 = 1.90 meters      Step 3 -- divide the distance travelled by the raft by the time it took the stone to hit the water.

TMB4d3FAaa	During her life time a worker bee produces an excess of 1/12 of tsp of honey. That's right, it takes 12 bees their whole life to leave 1 tsp of honey in the hive.  To begin with she consumes honey while she is developing as a larvae.  As soon as she pupates into a bee she begins to consume more honey. She immediately begins cleaning the cells. She is eating all the while. She does a variety of hive bee activities. When she is producing wax, it takes a 7 to 1 ratio of honey to wax. While she is guarding the hive she is eating..  Upon graduation to field bee, she begins replacing the honey she has already consumed.  The Scout bees, that may comprise 10% or more of the hive, don't replace a lot of honey. They use their loads to intice other bees to forage the site they have found.  They give each a taste of their prize.  They then give them the "waggle Dance" it instruct them where it is. Some is given to the hive bees to put aside. Some is for immediate consumption and some is to be stored for the future.  After about 6 weeks in the field she works herself to death.  Her legacy for the hive is about 1/12 tsp of finished honey.  The Drones, or boy toys, don't forage.  They are only there for one thing.  They comprise up to 20% of the hive. With this low production per bee, it is easy  see why up 70,000  and more worker bees are needed to produce excess honey for human consumption.  One bee life time = only one twelfth of a teaspoon of honey.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Bees drink sugar water (nectar) from flowers. They later puke up the nectar into the honey comb.

Instead try using various shapes of blocks and different materials.  It would be hard to calculate the exact friction force without knowing the coeffient of friction, so knowing your surface material is going to be important.    I did a simliar project back in high school.  Instead of friction force, i calculated just regular force depending on different angles of the incline ramp.  I placed toy train tracks on the ramp trying to dispell as much friction as I can, and used a toy train instead of a ball or block to limit friction.      Just an idea to throw at ya..|`|3eIuXzrAaa	To measure the frictional force you need to measure the speed of the ball at the end of the ramp and you need to measure the length of the ramp which is the length the ball will have traveled before you measure the final speed.    Compare the speed you measure to your theoretical speed.    Theoretical speed is given by the following equation (keep in mind that you need to be using si units (kg, m/s, m etc):    symbols:    L = length of ramp  v = velocity  h = height  g = 9.81 m/s^2  m = mass of the ball (this has little effect on the theoretical speed, but perhaps it has an effect on the friction, try to explain why ;D )    Here is the equation for speed:    v = square root of (2gh)    Basically you will compare this velocity to your recorded velocity:    Lets say you predict a theoretical speed of 5 m/s and you record a speed of 4 m/s...    This means that you have two different accelerations, the acceleration in real life being less.    The Theoretical acceleration = ((theoretical velocity)^2) / (2L)    The actual acceleration = ((actual velocity)^2) / (2L)    Now we calculate the theoretical force felt by the ball and the actual:    Theoretical Force = theoretical acceleration * mass of ball    Actual Force = real acceleration * mass of ball    Frictional Force = Actual Force - Theoretical Force    Notice that the frictional force has a negative value, this is because it is working in the opposite direction, thus it is slowing down the ball :D    I think this is correct, but this is just my own theory :P

Therefore, we need to look at the general form:  y = mx + b and recall that the following is true:    m = slope of line    (x,y) = any point on the line    b = y-intercept of line    Therefore, we know the slope = -3 and can apply this to the general equation to get:    y = -3x + b    Now, we have to apply the given point to this equation to solve for 'b' and get the following:    2 = -3(-4) + b    After simplification, we find that we get the following:    2 = 12 + b    b = -10    Therefore, applying all of this information, we get the following:    y = -3x - 10     I hope that helps you out!

EARTHQUAKES: Earthquakes occur when two plates fault, as in one plate goes up and the other goes down, thus making vibration and it is released in P-waves.
AA10306863	Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million species, with a best estimate of somewhere near 10 million. Note the word macroscopic, this excludes microscopic oragnisms.    The U.S. has over 17,000 identified native plant and tree species, including 5,000 just in California. With habitats ranging from tropical to arctic, the flora of the U.S. is the most diverse of any country; yet, thousands of non-native exotic species sometimes adversely affect indigenous plant and animal communities. Over 400 species of mammal, 700 species of bird, 500 species of reptile and amphibian, and 90,000 species of insect have been documented.     Insects are the most diverse group of animals on the earth, with around 925,000 species describedmore than all other animal groups combined. There's over a million arthropods, a group which includes insects.    About 350,000 species of plants have been estimated to exist. As of 2004, some 287,655 species had been identified, of which 258,650 are flowering.

AA12336219	Nelson's Complexity Index. This is the index through which the level of complexity of a refinery is measured worldwide. Higher the index, higher is the complexity. The complexity signifies the ability of a particular refinery to alter its product-mix in response to the availability of the type of feedstock and also the change in the demand pattern of the finished products. It indicates large secondary processing capacity, leading to higher value addition, and higher refining margins, as compared to less complex refineries. For e.g. lighter distillates command a premium over middle and heavy distillates and middle over heavy distillates. Also different types of crude oil produces different distillates in different proportions. But the more complex refinery would be able to achieve product mix desired on different variety of crude input. This enables the refinery to optimize its output    Refinery size usually is measured in terms of distillation capacity. Relative size, however, can be measured using refinery complexity--a concept developed by W.L. Nelson in the 1960s. Nelson developed the complexity index to quantify the relative cost of components that make up a refinery. It is a pure cost index that provides a relative measure of the construction costs of a particular refinery based on its crude and upgrading capacity. The Nelson index compares the costs of various upgrading units--such as a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit or a catalytic reformer--to the cost of a crude distillation unit. Computation of the index is an attempt to quantify the relative cost of a refinery based on the added cost of various upgrading units and the relative upgrading capacity. A review of complexity calculations, and an explanation of how indices have changed, provide a simple means of determining the complexity of single refineries or refining regions.|`|9ed2bd4136cee7facfe5544013e0fa15aa	Definitive and complete answer above - certainly the best.

AA10299755	If you have already read other introductory books like "A Briefer History of Time", then you may not want to read it because you'll be getting very similar information. However, I will say that "A Briefer History of Time" does provide some historical backgorund information that the other books you mentioned didn't provide.    Here is a list of books that I recommend:    Goldsmith, Donald, Einsteins Greatest Blunder? (Harvard U.P., Cambridge, MA, 1995). All about the reintroduction of the cosmological constant.    Greene, Brian, The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality (Knopf, NY, 2004).     Guth, Alan H., The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins (Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1997). Excellent book. Would make a good text if you have a bit of science background.    Harrison, Edward R., Cosmology: The Science of the Universe, 2nd ed. (Cambridge U.P., Cambridge, 2000). Probably the best real textbook of cosmology for the nontechnical reader. It contains much history, philosophy, and wisdom.    Hawley, John F. and Katherine A. Holcomb, Foundations of Modern Cosmology (Oxford U.P., 1997). A textbook for a course such as this one. Much of this book is on-line.    Kaku, Michio, Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos (Doubleday, Random House, 2005).|`|c44c906eedc08fd0460017d3d9f6d98baa	I haven't read "The Universe in a Nutshell" but my understanding is that its simply a newer version of History of Time.

dbf01a93987b370a9af4a909a6f57a85aa	The chart consist of radius and the boom length.  From the chart, you can see that the minimum radius and the shortest boom length will be approximately the capacity of the crane (the maximum weight the crane can lift).    The further the load from the center of the crane, the less weight it can lift.  This goes the same as to the boom length.    Hope this help.|`|bfb0081df88341de78fa6a5996272899aa	Load charts are given in following website:    To determine the capacity of the crane by using the load chart, the operator must know the length of boom, the load radius, the boom angle, and if the lift is to be performed over the side or over the rear. When  performing  lifts  using  the  boom  angle indicator that indicates an angle not noted on the load chart, use the next lower boom angle noted on the load chart for determining the capacity of the crane.    For example, using the load charts in figure 12-47 of the website given as reference, the crane is rigged with 60 feet of boom, and the boom angle indicator  indicates  a  boom  angle  of  57  degrees.  A 57-degree boom angle load capacity is not noted on the load chart, so you must use the next lower noted boom angle of 53 degrees for determining the capacity of the crane.     NOTE: Do not rely on the boom angle indicator for radius accuracy when lifts exceed 75 percent of the rated capacity. Measure the radius to avoid the possibility of error. When using a radius measurement not noted on

If g is the amount by which the rope is lengthened    then the slack is g/2xPi.    So the extra rope is 12 inches and approximating Pi to 3 you have 12 divided by approx. 6 = approx. 2 inches. (= approx. 5 cm).    It seem so counter intuitive, but the maths tells you that the slack does not depend on the size of the sphere, just on the amount that you add to the length of the rope.    Of course the Earth isn't a perfect sphere, so you'd be brushing across the top of a few hills and mountains as you trace the 2inches of slack around the world.|`|968bc7c8dfa5c8ee23e19a7e540db963aa	If we let the radius of the Earth be R, then the circumference is 2piR. Now let g represent the length of the gap between the lengthened rope and the Earths surface. Then the circumference of the lengthened rope is equal to 2pi(R+g) which we know is 1 metre greater than the circumference of the Earth or 2piR+1. Therefore, we have the equation        2pi(R+g) = 2piR+1  which we can solve for the gap size g and obtain        g = 1/2pi .  If we take pi to be 3.16, we have that the gap between the Earths surface and the lengthened rope is about 16 centimetres. The truly remarkable thing about this solution is that the length of the gap is independent of the size of the sphere we use. It may be a golf ball or a basketball or the Earth itself. If we fit a cord about its circumference and then lengthen the cord by one metre, the size of the gap will always be the same - about 16 centimetres!|`|75e45e59dd10e580d1c1f1052e55d7edaa	let C=initial length of rope        l=length added      R=initial radius of earth       r=increase in radius of circular rope around earth     therefore,     2piR =C................(1)                 2pi(R+r) =C+l               2piR+2pir=C+l.............(2)    subtract (1) from(2)    >>>>>>>>>2pi r = l         therefore,          r =l/2pi............(3)    say l=12inches, r=12/2pi=6/pi=1.91 inches(approx)    hence,if the rope is increased by 1 ft,there will be  1.91 inches of slack around the world,assuming that   the earth is a perfectly smooth sphere       i hope that this helps|`|AA10821952	Who cares its a rope belt|`|f1dde8fabd117742a3ea1e19e371b6a3aa	Dunno but have they fitted it some trousers yet?|`|3f01b5ec88c0996ba6c2258babfe3555aa	expansion

Mesmo depois de mortas, muitas delas continuam agarradas as suas parceiras, de modo que uma grande parte delas, ficam a salvo, como encima de um barco.     como se uma grande parte delas se sacrificassem para salvar uma outra grande parte.      interessante como o senso de uni?o delas funciona t?o bem.

807896964b6a149310aa786e3a57e292aa	Cerca de 3/4 da Terra s?o cobertos por rochas sedimentares que revestem partes dos continentes e dos fundos oceanicos. No entanto, estas formam apenas um pelcula superficial sobre as rochas magmticas e metamrficas que constituem a maioria do volume rochoso crustal.    Os sedimentos, precursores das rochas sedimentares, encontram-se na superfcie terrestre resultantes de fenmenos de meteoriza??o e eros?o de rochas pr-existentes assim como de restos organicos. Assim s?o constitudos maioritariamente por areias, siltes e conchas de organismos. Estes primeiros, formam-se  medida que a meteoriza??o vai fragmentando as rochas da crosta, sendo posteriormente transportados pela eros?o.  A gua e o vento s?o os principais agentes de transporte de sedimentos. Quando estes agentes perdem a capacidade de transportar, devido a uma diminui??o da velocidade, ocorre a sedimenta??o.    Com o continuar da sedimenta??o, os sedimentos dispostos nos estratos inferiores s?o compactados (diminui??o de volume) e cimentados (precipita??o de minerais novos em torno das partculas depositadas, colando-as). Ao conjunto de processos que transformam os sedimentos em rochas sedimentares consolidadas d-se o nome de diagnese.  Os sedimentos e as rochas sedimentares s?o caracterizados pela presen?a de estratifica??o - que resulta da forma??o de camadas paralelas e horizontais, pela deposi??o contnua de partculas no fundo de um oceano, de um lago, de um rio ou numa superfcie continental.    Uma outra caractersitica das rochas sedimentares  a sua ordena??o temporal. Assim numa sequncia de estratos que n?o tenha sido modificada da sua posi??o original, um estrato  mais antigo do que aquele que est por cima, e mais recente do que o que est por baixo - Princpio da sobreposi??o.   quando se d a deposi??o de sedimentos que ocorre o enterramento de organismos que poder?o originar fsseis. Nos casos em que ocorre boa preserva??o das evidncias organicas, reunem-se geralmente quatro condi??es:    - enterramento rpido;    - com sedimentos finos;    - em ambiente marinho;    - o organismo contm partes duras.

Some science experiments can not be done in a high gravity environment. We depend on an expanding scientific understanding to improve our life on Earth.  2. The resources of the Earth are limited. There are many resources in space but we are not able to get to them. We have to develop space travel in order to be able to use the resources that we know are out there.  3. Modern economies depend on a healthy Research and Development component. That means that not only do we need a lot of scientists and researchers to graduate from universities, but those people must be able to get jobs. It does them no good to build another 5,000 schools or another 10,000 miles of freeways. They need jobs that use their knowledge and training. The higher the science involved, the more expensive it is. Today, only multinational corporations and strong governments are able to afford huge research budgets. But the benefits of advanced science are necessary for human survival and progress. Sending people into space is just the tip of the pyramid. Supporting the space exploration are tens of thousands of scientists and researchers who hope to increase our knowledge and success, and thousands of corporations who hope to discover profitable processes and materials.  4. Politics is a dynamic and flexible social institution. No political leader can afford to turn away from the very visual and exciting aspects of space exploration. All over the Earth, leaders must weigh the costs of doing advanced scientific research against the costs of not doing advanced scientific research. As long as the political process is flexible, many avenues or research will be followed in the hopes of advancing both national and personal prestige.     ;-D The world has a tiger by the tail, and can't let go.

Robots are harder to build and operate. It's easier to tell a person what to do.    D. Humans like to explore. Lets go to mars.|`|8469593f9d7d77eea482f266ff1b76deaa	When you see a place like Disneyland on TV, why go there? To experience the place right? It is the same for going to space. It is just not enough that we can see distant bodies with telescopes, we must also be able to see and feel them (not always literally of course) first hand.  It could also prove advantageous to research and the future of the human race. Everyone knows of the population problem, the problem with too little resources, etc. By sending people to space and expanding the limits of space travel, we can hope to one day find a habitable planet and be able to send humans there to live. After all, Earth can't be the only planet capable of supporting life in the universe! By continually sending people to space, we can find more about how a human body would react to space travel and we can be closer to the machines which can relay information to us. We can also conduct experiments first hand, without having to relay instructions from Earth to robots which may mess things up. The International Space Station, which is orbiting around the world, will be manned and manually maintained. For this also, we will have to send people to space. We will be frequently sending people into space pretty soon with so many orbiting projects coming up, so do not expect the tide of astronauts going beyond the atmosphere to stop anytime soon!|`|0c8714b0ca07418a54a1be25ed798dd3aa	to be short,   It is due to curosity, the knack of knowing something new.

ec616dede10de729cd1128ea466ad4cdaa	This is most easily explained first in terms of energies.     An object has 'Kinetic energy' when it is in motion.   KE=(1/2)mv^2   ie. the kinetic energy equals one half of the mass times the velocity squared)    When you hold a pendulum above its equilibrium point, it has 'Potential Energy' meaning that if you let go, it will be pulled downward by the Earth's gravitational field and will gain Kinetic Energy.   PE=mgh   ie. potential energy equals the mass of the object, times the gravitational constant (-9.81m/s^2 at Earth's surface) times its height (in metres) above its minimum height (it's equilibrium point in this case).    Energy is always conserved, ie PE+KE is constant for any system, so when potential energy is lost, kinetic energy is gained, and vice versa.     So at the top of the swing, the pendulum has its maximum potental energy, and no kinetic energy. But at the bottom of it's swing all it's potential energy is gone, turned into kinetic energy. And object with lots of kinetic energy will keep moving until it loses it! As is goes up the other side of the swing, it loses the kinetic energy, and regains its potential energy. Then the same thing happens all over again!    We can also say that when an object is in motion (ie has kinetic energy) it also has a certain momentum (p), given by p=mv. ie. momentum equals the mass times the velocity. The momentum will cause it to keep moving even while gravity opposes its motion. As it goes up, it loses momentum. Eventually gravity wins at the top of the swing, and the pendulum starts coming back down, gaining momentum as it moves. At the bottom of the swing momentum has a greater force than gravity again, so it moves through the equilibrium and goes up the other side. Repeat!|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Eventually, it does. Until then, the momentum will continue to swing past the equilibrium point until it runs out of steam - air and pivot friction and gravity.|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	'Equilibrium' means that all of the forces acting on an object sum to zero.  But at the vertical position, there is a force (called 'momentum') acting on the pendulum.  You should get a physics book and read up on it ?      Doug|`|9a1901b64759c6de3c15bd8884927a46aa	it is acted upon by restoring force,  inertia of motin and the kinetic energy it posseses
ec616dede10de729cd1128ea466ad4cdaa	The first thing to do to solve this problem is to draw a diagram showing all the forces acting on the system, ie.   1)the force of gravity downward  2)the forces applied by the rope, both horizontally(forward) and vertically (up) (the one force can be broken up into these two independant components. Check your textbook for a review on how to do this if necessary.)  3)the force of friction backward  4)the normal force upward    Then look at the equations at your disposal. We have   1)Newton's second law: Fnet=ma, the net force equals the mass times the acceleration.   2)Ff=(mu)Fn, the force of friction equals the coefficient of friction (represented by the greek letter 'mu') times the normal force  3)Fg=mg, the force of gravity equals the mass of the object times the gravitational constant (9.81ms^-2 at Earth's surface)    Now we remember Newton's First Law of Motion: in the absence of a net force, an object in motion will stay in motion, and an object at rest will stay at rest.    Since the object (a laundry basket in your case) is not moving vertically (it's sliding horizontally along the floor only), we can see that there is no net force vertically. Therefore all vertical forces (the force of gravity downward, the vertical part of the force of the rope upward, and the normal force upward) must add up to zero. up is positive, down is negative. Since you know the first two, you can find the third, Fn, or the Normal Force.     Remember that the equation that we need to solve is Ff=(mu)Fn. We now have Fn, so all we need to do is find Ff, or the force of friction, and we can solve for (mu). Almost there!    Since the laundry basket is moving forward, Newton's First Law says that there must be a Net Force on it. In other words, all the horizontal forces add up to a positive number (since the basket is moving forward). This Net Force equals the mass times the acceleration (Fnet=ma). You are given both m and a, so finding Fnet is just a matter of multiplication.     Now to figure out Ff:    Look at your horizontal forces: you have the horizontal component of the force from the rope 'pulling forward' and the force of friction (Ff) resisting the motion (ie 'pulling backward').    So the the 'force forward' minus the 'force backward' equals the net force, or F(rope, horizontal)-Ff = Fnet. The only one you don't know is Ff, so F(rope)-Fnet=Ff.    Now, using Ff=(mu)Fn, (Force of friction = coefficient of friction times the normal force) where we just found Ff and Fn, you can rearrange and solve for (mu). Done!|`|adb13959b94de7c13eff037609ea7f39aa	draw a free body diagram with all the forces acting on it, and the acceleration should equal the sum of all the forces divided by mass. Here:    friction   T    with a normal force (n) upwards, and the mg pulling down,  where the acceleration would be in the direction to the right --->    so, what you would do is:     m*a = T - friction  (3kg)(0.2ms^-2) = 8N - (Uk)(n)  0.6 = 8 - (Uk)(mg)  Uk= 0.25 (approx)      oooh wait sorry, didnt notice the rope was inclined...:p|`|AA11748488	Resolving vertically: N + Tsin30 = mg  => N + 8sin30 = 3(9.81)  => N = 29.43 - 4  => N = 25.43 Newtons  (where N is the normal force.)    Resolving horizontally: Tcos30 - uN = ma  => 8cos30 - u(25.43) = 3(0.2)  => 8cos30 - 0.6 = 25.43u  => u = 0.2488  (where u is the coefficient of friction.)
ec616dede10de729cd1128ea466ad4cdaa	Friction opposes the motion of an object and acts to slow it down. It is *always* in the direction opposite to motion.    An object's motion is determined by the equation Fnet=ma, or The Net Force equals the mass of the object, times its acceleration.     The Net Force is the forces 'pulling or pushing' an object forward, minus the forces 'pulling or pushing' it backward.     The Force of Friction works in the direction opposite to motion, and is found by the equation "Ff=(mu)Fn", where Ff is the Force of Friction, Fn is the Normal Force, and (mu) is the Greek letter which represents the coefficient of friction, which depends on how 'rough or smooth' the two surfaces are.    The Normal Force is the force that acts opposite the Force of Gravity. If there are no other forces upward and the object isn't moving up or down, it is equal and opposite to the Force of Gravity (Fg=mg).|`|aaafc62c9e59cea83a56a8eee4b29a5caa	it slows them down|`|c23280104ec8bec55207f2a36a60fc3eaa	as much as its friction constant between them's value  friction is nothing else than small hooks between the surfaces, slowing them out if the constant is lower that the kinetical energy of the moving object. until it stops.  if it is larger than the constant , the object wont stop.

When you're a conscious breather, it's just not feasible to be completely unconscious -- what if you don't wake up in time? The solution for whales and dolphins is to let one half of the brain sleep at a time. In this way, the animal is never completely unconscious, but it still gets the rest it needs.     Scientists have studied this phenomenon in dolphins, using electroencephalography. In this process, electrodes hooked up to the head measure electricity levels in the brain. The resulting electroencephalograms (EEGs) of dolphin brains demonstrate that in the sleep cycle, half of the dolphin's brain does indeed "shut down" while the other half is still active.

World Fertilizer Supply and Demand     4.1 CONSUMPTION     According to figures issued by the International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA), world consumption of mineral fertilizers made a slight recovery in 1995/96: it rose by 6% to reach a total of 131 million tonnes of nutrients (N, P2O5 and K2O), which is equivalent to approximately 400 million tonnes of product. Nitrogen consumption rose by 7%, phosphorus consumption by 4.7%, and potassium consumption by 5.7%, when compared with the preceding year. The areas which reported the highest increases in consumption were Asia (11%) and North America (5%); there was no significant increase in consumption in the markets of western Europe.              Source : FAO/IFA    When comparing consumption during 1995/96 with that of 1989/90, a decline of 9% can be seen. This was mainly due to an 82% drop in consumption in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and a 63% drop in the Central and East European countries, (CEE countries). In the same period, the EU experienced a decline in consumption of 19%. At the root of these developments lay the political and economic changes in the CIS and the CEE countries (which have led to a reduction in demand) and the stricter environmental legislation and increased set-aside imposed in the EU as a result of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 1992.    The development of the consumption of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers by region is shown in Figures 3 and 4.              Source : FAO/IFA         Source : FAO/IFA    The combined share of Africa, Latin America, and Asia in world consumption has risen dramatically during the past decade.

Since 1989/90, world production has declined by roughly 6%. The production of nitrogen has increased by 3%, while the production of phosphate and potash has fallen by 15% and 21%, respectively. The combined production of the three major nutrients has declined by 27% in the EU, by 42% in the CEE countries, and by 50% in the CIS. In North America and Asia, on the other hand, production has increased by 15% and 27%, respectively.    Figures 6 and 7 compare the production and consumption of N and P2O5 worldwide.         Source : IFA              Source : IFA    4.3 WORLD FERTILIZER TRADE     In recent years, world trade has increased considerably. In 1995/96, cross-border trade amounted to 31% of the world consumption of nitrogen fertilizers and 40% of the world consumption of phosphate fertilizers. The recent increase in trade is illustrated below.

The CEE countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) are by far the largest exporters.    The largest producer of phosphate fertilizers is North America. The largest consumer is Asia, followed by North America and the EU. The main exporters of phosphate fertilizers in 1995/96 were the USA, North Africa and Russia.    The main exporter of potash in 1995/96 was Canada, and the second largest was Germany.    The major importers of nitrogen in 1995/96 were China, India and the USA, and the flow of imports into the EU, mainly from the CEE countries and the CIS, continued to increase. India and China were also the main importers of phosphate fertilizers. As far as potash is concerned, the USA was the major importer in 1995/96 (importing from Canada), followed by China and India.    Expressed as a percentage of total trade, intra-regional trade amounted to 44% of all nitrogen traded and 25% of all phosphate traded. The main trading regions are shown in the table below.

AA11984457	The term lanthanide generally refers to the elements lanthanum (Z = 57) to  lutetium (Z = 91). The lanthanides plus yttrium are some times referred to as rare-earths  since they are found in relatively low abundance as metal oxides in the earths crust. The  most prevalent oxidation state for the lanthanides is +3 and thus have electronic  configurations denoted [Xe]f0 to [Xe]f14. The f orbitals are relatively uninvolved in  bonding. However, these highly electropositive metals have a rich coordination  chemistry and are strong Lewis acids. Because of their large size, lanthanides are known  with coordination numbers as high as twelve. Lanthanides are commonly used as nmr  shift reagents and may have applications in catalysis.1 Perhaps their most important  feature however, is their luminescence behavior that has been exploited in commercial  phosphors for television and other display applications. In this experiment you will  explore the spectroscopic properties of some highly luminescent Eu(III) complexes.1,2  The visible absorption spectra of lanthanide compounds is generally dominated by  f-f transitions. Because the f orbitals are well shielded from the surroundings and are not  involved in the bonding, the f-f transitions are very sharp and essentially insensitive to the  coordination environment.3 This behavior is quite different from the d-d (or ligand field)  transitions of transition metal compounds which display broad absorption bands whose  color can be tuned by varying the ligand field, see Experiment VIII for example.  Lanthanide complexes in the +3 oxidation state, Ln(III), derived from Terbium (Tb),  Holmium (Ho), and Europium (Eu) all display f-f luminescence when they are excited  with light. Several years ago, it was discovered that complexation by certain chelating  ligands enhances the Ln(III) photoluminescence.4 A simplified diagram that explains the  enhanced photoluminescence is shown below in Scheme 1. The basic idea is that energy  transfer occurs from ligand localized excited states, ES, to f orbitals of the lanthanide,  Eu(III) shown here. The energy transfer products are an excited Ln(III) complex that then  relaxes to the ground state by emission of a photon. In this lab you will utilize the  chelating ligand 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (dipicolinic acid or DPA) to enhance the  photoluminescence of Eu(III) solution.

8b24df9325c99ab13f9f6d0244219134aa	f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c, a >= 0 and b > 0.    To determine concavity, we need to solve for the second derivative and then make it 0.    f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b  f''(x) = 6x + 2a    Now, we make f''(x) equal to 0.    0 = 6x + 2a    And then we solve for x.    -6x = 2a, therefore x = (-1/3)a = -a/3    Our critical number is -a/3.  To determine where this is concave up and down, we need to test one value less than -a/3, and one value greater than -a/3.  We want to test it in this function:    f''(x) = 6x + 2a     For a value greater than -a/3, choose x = -a/3 + 1.    Then f''(x) = 6(-a/3 + 1) + 2a = (-2a + 6) + 2a = 6, which is positive.  Therefore, we know that the function is concave up on (-a/3, infinity)    For a value less than -a/3, choose x = -a/3 - 1.  Then f''(x) = 6(-a/3 - 1) + 2a = (-2a - 6) + 2a = -6, which is negative.  Therefore, we know the function is concave down on (-infinity, -a/3).    f is concave up on (-a/3, infinity), and   f is concave down on (-infinity, a/3)    (b) To show that f has exactly one inflection point, we refer back to our second derivative.    f''(x) = 6x + 2a    This can only get us AT MOST one solution.  Since we have intervals of concavity, there has to be one inflection point; it's at  f(-a/3) = (-a/3)^3 + a(-a/3)^2 + b(-a/3) + c  f(-a/3) = -a^3/27 + a(a^2/9) - [ab]/3 + c  f(-a/3) = -a^3/27 + a^3/9 - [ab]/3 + c    (c)     We're given that f(0) = -2, so    f(0) = c = -2    Since we just solved for our inflection point general formula, and we're given that (0,-2) is an inflection point, it follows that  f''(0) = 0  f''(0) is also equal to 6x + 2a; therefore,  f''(0) = 6(0) + 2a = 0, or 2a = 0, or a = 0.    Therefore, a = 0, c = -2, and   f(x) = x^3 + (0)x^2 + bx - 2, or  f(x) = x^3 + bx - 2    f'(x) = 3x^2 + b    To solve for the critical points, we make f'(x) equal to 0.    0 = 3x^2 + b  -b = 3x^2  -b/3 = x^2, therefore  x = "plus or minus" sqrt (-b/3)    HOWEVER, it is given that b is STRICTLY GREATER than 0, so it follows that -b/3 is a negative number.  We can't take the square root of -b/3 with the given condition that it is greater than 0.  If it were greater than or equal to, we'd get a solution (since we can take the square root of 0).  But unfortunately, it is strictly greater.|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	A. Is just another way of asking, "Where is the 2'nd derivative positive or negative." (Negative is concave up)    B.

Therefore,  lim x-> [f(x) - g(x)] = 0    Substitute the f(x) and g(x)  lim x-> [(2x2 - 5x + 5)/(x - 2) - (mx + b)] = 0    Get the LCD  lim x-> [(2x2 - 5x + 5) - (mx + b)(x - 2)]/(x - 2) = 0    Distribute  lim x-> (2x2 - 5x + 5 - mx2 - bx + 2mx + 2b)/(x - 2) = 0    In order for the limit to be zero, the numerator should have a degree at least one less than that of the denominator.

f6190ace7a091d01b1b7c7c93926a5d4aa	Boiling is a function of both temperature and pressure.  When the water was boiling, it was at the necessary temperature for the given pressure of the room (barometric).  When she stoppered the flask, the volume of the system was fixed.  As time passed, the pressure in the flask was reduced at the same rate at which the water cooled.  However, the relationship between the pressure and temperature remained the same as it was when the water was boiling.  By cooling the flask with ice, the pressure in the flask was reduced but the temperature of the water was not.  This changed the balance of temperature and pressure to give the water sufficient temperature to boil in the reduced pressure of the flask.

The outermost oily layer is produced by the meibomian glands which line the edge of the eyelids.  The watery portion of the tear film is produced by the lacrimal gland.  This gland lies underneath the outer orbital rim bone, just below the eyebrow.  The mucous layer comes from microscopic goblet cells in the conjunctiva.       With each blink, the eyelids sweep across the eye, spreading the tear film evenly across the surface.  The blinking motion of the eyelids forces the tears into tiny drains found at the inner corners of the upper and lower eyelids.  These drains are called puncta (plural for punctum).       The tear film travels from the puncta into the upper and lower canaliculus, which empty into the lacrimal sac.  The lacrimal sac drains into the nasolacrimal duct which connects to the nasal passage.  This connection between the tear production system and the nose is the reason your nose runs when you cry.  Some patients can actually taste eye drops as they drain from the nasal passage into the throat.        http://www.stlukeseye.com/anatomy/TearPr...

6bca9f7fb5c095a46621e8ac664fc41faa	NaCl because it needs more energy to break its bond.|`|AA11589988	The bonding is stronger when the lattice energy is higher. So NaCl has stronger bonding than KCl.    The reason is that the ionic radius of Na+ is smaller than the ionic radius of K+ so that means the Na+ ions can pack closer together with the Cl ions in a NaCl lattice than the K+ and Cl- ions can in a KCl lattice.    The force holding the ions together is stronger when the ions are closer together so NaCl is bonded more strongly than KCl.     Lattice energy is the energy released when free ions condense into a crystal lattice. So logically the same value of energy is needed to break up that lattice and put the ions back into being free from each other again. That's why lattice energy values give an indication of the strength of the ionic bonding.

If there is something that will bond ionically, polar covalently, or metallic bonding will all create strong bonds, which means that their melting n boiling points will be very high. Elements such as the diatomic gases, who are bonded together covalently, will have lower melting and boiling points. Elements which cannot bond together, and can only interact through Van der Waal forces will have the lowest boiling and melting point of all. This is the case for all noble gases.
4c00775ec8b5e5972e6d8a437d642fd9aa	Nein, die werden schwerer.  Das kannst Du Dir klarmachen, wenn Du das ideale Gasgesetz anwendest. Das Molekulargewicht von Luft ist (0,8*28 + 0,2 * 32)g/Mol, also etwa 28,8 g/mol.  Das Atomgewicht von H2 und das von He ist 2 g/Mol, das von CH4 liegt bei 16 g/Mol.  Unter gleichen ?u?eren Bedingungen (Druck, Temperatur) ist ihre Dichte also geringer als die von Luft.  Wenn man die leichten Gase auf den blichen Druck von 200 bar (20000kPa) komprimiert, steigt die Dichte auf das 200- fache.  Bei diesem Druck ist also die Dichte der leichten Gase deutlich gr??er als die von Luft, so dass kein Auftrieb zu erwarten ist.|`|23e0201e9ee130ee30bad3a7465d0bf2aa	Spontan kann ich das ohne die Werte nachzuschlagen nicht beantworten. Du musst im Wesentlichen zwei Kraefte betrachten: Die Gewichtskraft, die zur Erde hinwirkt, sowie die Auftriebskraft, die das Teil nach oben zieht.    Beispiel Ballon: Wenn Helium drin ist, dann ist die Gewichtskraft kleiner (das macht aber nicht viel aus, da der Loewenanteil des Gewichts eher von der Ballonhaut selbst kommt) als wenn Luft drin waere. Das entscheidende ist, dass der Auftrieb groesser wird und die haengt mit der Masse der verdraengten Luft zusammen:    Die Auftriebskraft ist proportional zur Masse der verdraengten Luft.    Ist die Flasche nun mit Luft befuellt heben sich Auftrieb und Gewicht der Luft auf und du hast nur das reine Gewicht der Flasche.    Wenn du die Flache jetzt befuellst hast du die Auftriebskraft, die mit der Masse der Verdraengten Luft zusammen haengt nach oben, die Gewichtskraft des Gases nach unten. Wenn die Masse des Gases in der Flasche also geringer ist als die der Luft wird dein Gesamtsystem leichter.    Aber: Hier kommt der Druck ins Spiel. Ein Heliumteilchen ist zwar leichter als ein Luftteilchen (z.B. Stickstoff oder Sauerstoff), aber durch den hohen Druck presst du da viel mehr rein, als vorher Luftteilchen in der leeren Flasche war.    Ich muesste jetzt Werte annehmen um das genau zu berechnen, aber vermutlich ist durch den hohen Druck letztendlich mehr Masse an Helium in der Flasche als vorher an Luft drin war, woraus eine GEWICHTSZUNAHME folgen wuerde.    PS: Ah, da war wieder jemand ein klein bisschen schneller als ich. Guenter S hat recht.    @another_nick: Nein, die Masse eines Atoms ode Molekuels ist unabhaenig vom Aggregatszustand. Das haengt von der Dichte ab und die ist im fluessigen Fall in der Regel hoeher. Hoehere Dichte => mehr Teilchen (die aber jeweils noch genauso schwer sind wie vorher). Du kannst ein Gas ohne Schwierigkeiten soweit komprimieren (bei enstprechendem Druck und Temperatur), dass es dichter ist als eine Fluessigkeit.|`|82c64064ae238f0ce223f33036950a66aa	Nein denn die Gase werden nicht im Gasf?rmigen Zustand sondern im flssigen transprotiert.

I'm going to assume you meant to write the fraction (32x^(1/3)) / (2x^(1/3)), and you're asking whether this is 16^(1/3) or if it's 16.  If you see something like "32x^(1/3)", it's assumed that only the x is being raised to the power of 1/3.  Otherwise you'd write it as (32x)^(1/3).      For (32x^(1/3)) / (2x^(1/3)), there's a x^(1/3) being multiplied in both the numerator and denominator, so these cacel out, leaving you with 32/2 or 16.|`|2a81f8244ea0068b345f770654197fcaaa	You are correct.

4b848aeededab5d829264ab4d6182f0faa	Nerve gases usually come in the form of liquids - they need to be used in aerosols to spray so it would be easy to get them as liquid (their natural state) or even to turn them in to some sort of gel which you could wipe on sensitive objects. The danger is in having to get it off yourself, though washing it off with ordinary household bleach should render it harmless.    Frighteningly enough it would be easy to kill someone by making them touch nerve toxins because they can be absorbed by the skin and the tiniest drop could kill an adult human in seconds. Sarin could kill with about a miligram, Soman IV (invented later in WW2) is far stronger and VX invented in England much stronger still. They are all organophosphorus molecules.|`|AA10726317	anthrax ???|`|e7b8059f58cd05776a007d1777037c68aa	I think it was called "Made to Make Movie Interesting Spray". lol    There is no such thing that I know of. Nothing chemically kills that fast or can kill just from touching the chemical on your skin. A poison would take some time just to be absorbed through your skin and then it would have to start attacking your bodies systems: muscular, nervous, cardiac, etc.    Sweet movie though, I particularly like the part where Jack Black gets shot up. lol

He created the first cloned sheep DOLLY.    He took the unfertilised egg from a one sheep and udder cells from another sheep and fused them together to form a ZYGOTE.    This zygote was kept in another(3rd) sheep which gave birth to DOLLY.|`|AA12393734	I hope you get a lot of good answers.   My favourite book about clones is called Friday, it is written by Robert Heinlein.

Isn't it crazy that clones have come true?|`|73f45a099311cd8e83d789cc951f9acbaa	Three meaning of cloning:    (1) create a zygote where the original genetic material is removed from the cell, and the genetic material of another is inserted.  The zygote is implanted into a serogate mother, where it develops as any other zygote/fertilized egg would.    (2) non-sexual propogation, especially in the case of plants.  Tissue is removed, caused to grow (often through tissue cultures or clippings), and is then subdivided into several different individuals.  This happens naturally too (such as stawberries and spider plants).    (3) genetic fragment of interest in inserted into a vector (plasmid, DNA, etc) and used to transform competant bacterial cells that will replicate the vector.    Anything on simpler level -- great science fiction that makes hit movies

1f92e6b0a28b055cb63ed3fc4999ab31aa	There is no equation that can relate the %analyte to the % area. It is impossible to guess the volume of gas actually being injected after the splitter.    You must create a calibration curve using a set of standards. I usually create a curve on excel, and then plug in my unknown.    The Flame Ionize Detector is a very linear detector, a calibration curve should be straight as an arrow.  However, you cannot calculate the total area under all the peaks, and divide them by the area of a single peak. This is a common mistake, each compound has a significantly different detector response, and therefore, each compound must have its own calibration curve built. There is some relation to molecular mass and detector response, but it isn't worth it to figure it out.|`|180fc4e0fee85e1d7459e6a9825d5165aa	Please give more information.

5a2532e0c7ae12f9c33ad502bc192d58aa	Tachyon, hypothetical elementary particle that travels only at speeds exceeding that of light.     According to the theory of relativity, the speed of light is the limiting velocity for all ordinary material particles. Particles having nonzero rest mass can approach, but not reach, the speed of light, since their mass would become infinite at that speed. On the other hand, particles with zero rest mass, such as the photon, must always travel at the speed of light; they cannot be brought to rest or even slowed down. Theorists have argued that since nothing in principle prohibits the existence of a third class of particles that travel only at speeds exceeding that of light, such particles, called tachyons may exist although no evidence for them has been found. In the terminology of the theory, the particles that travel only at the speed of light are called luxons, and those that travel at lesser speeds are called tardyons.     Like the original theory of relativity, the theory of tachyons has several aspects that appear to contradict common sense but that are fully self-consistent. For example, a tachyon must have an imaginary (in the mathematical sense) rest mass, or proper mass, and it must travel faster rather than slow down when it loses energy.|`|b1ceb7c8481526a9137bbf36ef3f74aaaa	Tachyons are only hypothetical; they have never been proven to exist.  They are particles that travel faster than light.  The existence of tachyons was first theorized by German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, but it was two men named George Sudarshan and Gerald Feinberg who gave the particle its name.  Interestingly, the tachyon can never slow to the speed of light or below; it travels only at speeds greater than light.  In classical physics, nothing can travel faster than light.|`|9249c05c0891c00e16353a0fc5c21663aa	A tachyon (from the Greek ?? {takhs}, meaning "swift") is a hypothetical particle that travels at superluminal velocity. The first theoretical description of tachyons is attributed to physicist Arnold Sommerfeld; however, the concept has recurred in a variety of other contexts, such as string theory. Many strange properties have been attributed to tachyons, which also play a role in some popular science fiction
AA11012204	we would like to monitor our DNA as it migrates across the gel. We can  do this--almost. Rather than mark the actual DNA, we can include charged molecules, called dyes, that are of two different sizes and colors. One is smaller than most or all of our DNA fragments, and will therefore run as fast or faster than the smallest DNA fragments. The other dye is large, and will migrate along with the very large DNA pieces. We can therefore assume that our sample is somewhere in between the dyes, so when the small dye gets near the end of the gel, the gel is stopped.     Ethidium bromide is commonly used to detect nucleic acids in the lab. In the case of DNA this is usually double-stranded DNA from PCRs, restriction digests, etc. Single-stranded RNA can also be detected, since it usually folds back onto itself and thus provides local base pairing for the dye to intercalate. Detection typically involves a gel containing nucleic acids placed on or under a UV lamp. Since ultraviolet light is harmful to eyes and skin, a camera is used for recording ethidium bromide fluorescence. In other cases, a protective screen is put between the observer and the UV source.    Check out this site for a DNA fingerprinting protocol that uses the two elements above.  http://www.tree.caltech.edu/protocols/fi...|`|9249c05c0891c00e16353a0fc5c21663aa	Ethidium bromide (EtBr) is an intercalating agent commonly used as a nucleic acid stain in molecular biology laboratories for techniques such as agarose gel electrophoresis.

2bda798cb24430aea01a740844d5df7eaa	It is believe by several physics theories that matter is created by condensed energy, squashed together. It was said on one discovery channel prgramme that if all the matter in a sugger cube were to be released into energy at one time, it would have 3 or 4 times the power of the nuclear bomb that hit horishima.    Something else for you: It is aslo strongly believed that at the dawn of time and the begining of the universe as we know it there were only a few basic element around such as hydrogen and helium. All the Carbon came ONLY from the death of stars, therefore you are made up largely of matter that was once a star :)|`|AA10890123	Yes we are all believed to be made up of energy, every cell, every atom of our structure is energy. some people believe we are all just made of Quentin energy, and our energy and thought that we put out into the world can change us and those around us.

The early universe was pure energy.  Then it cooled and matter condensed out.  But that matter was almost entirely hydrogen and helium.  The hydrogen came together under gravity and made stars.  Inside the stars, nuclear reactions made the other elements.  When those stars burned out, some exploded with great violence scattering the elements.  Some came together under gravity and formed the Earth.    We are the stuff of exploding stars, gathered together in this tiny place in a most fortunate and very unlikely way.    If someone wants to say a higher power planned that, neither I nor science can disprove them.|`|a7a7d61d2304fa70769870fad1171da0aa	You are correct.  Our composition is that of mass, whether of liquid or solid, and these are formed of small bits of matter, all of which is formed of electromagnetic energy.  Having a common energy value allows physical time to exist as a common factor to everything in our universe, so all events pass from the present into the past at the same rate.    Should you have an interest, there is a short writing entitled "The Problem and Repair of Relativity" that describes our composition further.  It is at http://360.yahoo.com/noddarc  or  http://timebones.blogspot.com|`|2f170fed7b99a4e91335fc9023a803caaa	Yup. The Universe and everything in it is made of pure energy that appeared in the beginning. Some of that energy formed into tiny bundles called "photons" that zoom in waves of different sizes (the electromagnetic spectrum). Photons can come together and form tiny particles that we named "electrons, protons, and neutrons".  We also call those particles "matter". Particles can come together and form families that we call "atoms".  Atoms that are the same, have the same number of each of the three particles, are called "elements" of the Periodic Table. Elements can come together and form compounds.  Compounds can come together and form organic compounds. Organic compounds can come together into lifeforms capable of consciousness and possessing senses. Therefore, everything in the known Universe, including stars and planets and you, is made of pure energy. Here is a wonderful image that we were able to take recently of the beginning of the Universe when all that pure energy, or, "light", first appeared.

It has excellent waterproofing properties so is ideally suited for sealing roofing. It melts at (look it up) so once heated can be poured into nooks and crannies to keep rain water out.    It has many other uses including road making where it is used as a composite material.|`|e70e42429c333fa029abdbcdae37f2a2aa	Viscous, black and sticky. It's derived from crude oil.|`|aca9f3772d5ce03c4510fa67723c9a4daa	Bitumen is a very heavy hydrocarbon consisting of Hydrogen and Carbon, obviously. It is highly viscous meaning it is very thick. It is made from crude oil. Bitumen's volatility makes it the perfect use for roads, as it has a high melting point.
67455069199892d2d478dfea3de45fa7aa	Since membranes are really not permeable to the electrolytes present in and around cells, but they are permeable to water, simple thermodynamics will do all it could to make the total concentration of particles (osmolarity) equal on both sides of the membrane by allowing water to cross until the concentrations even out.  What does this mean?  It means that we need to maintain the solutions the cells bathe in (extracellular fluid) at certain concentrations of certain ions, since we can't control the insides of the cells.  This is why we get thirsty, when there is too much sodium (and other electrolytes) in circulation.    Now, if you follow the news, you will have seen that a woman in California died of "water intoxication".  This means that because she consumed so much water without urinating, the concentration of dissolved particles in her blood and extracellular fluid became much less than inside her cells.  So thermodynamics made water enter all her cells, and they swelled up, causing massive swelling in her brain, and ultimately death.|`|53459eb8a38e5abd9fbf2621a324ddddaa	it might decrease or increase the flow|`|AA10762368	Please rephrase your question as I have difficulty understanding just what it is you seek to know.  Thank you.|`|d4956b925d1b92b0a89d625c05c3f033aa	Transport into and out of cells is caused by a selectively permeable membrane in a cell. Differing water solutions do not create problems for cell transport. I don't where you got that question but the question is phrased wrong. Proper water balance is maintained inside and outside the cell by diffusion but it is also determined by water concentration in a certain area.
c30e2cd4342816ffab5be22eb14c292caa	Ethanoic acid has one H atom that can be lost as an H+ ion, leaving a single negative ion called ethanoate (or acetate).  Copper forms a 2+ ion, so will need two ethanoate ions to combine with it.    So the eventual formula is Cu(CH3COO)2.    Copper metal does not react directly with the acid, by the way. I assume the question you were really asking is: what is the formula of copper ethanoate (acetate)?|`|AA10739773	C2H4O2 + Cu --> ... go do the research yourself...read your textbook!|`|19bd10437043af063fd498a9cfd03c7eaa	when an acid and a metal react hydrogen gas will evolve and a salt will form|`|d14c9a42bac00be0412030ad76a667afaa	Lancenigo di Villorba (TV), Italy    I executed many and many times this simple experiment.  If you want repeate it, you can follow this instructions.    YOUR DETAILS  Acetic acid is a common organic acid, it belongs to carboxylic acids. Its molecular stucture is the following :    CH3-C=O  .........|  ........OH    Since you desire know something about its copper's salt, I sent you the "chemical formula" of the latter, e.g. (CH3COO)2Cu or copper(II) acetate.    YOUR EXPERIMENT  You bring a close glass-vessel.  You open the vessel for introducing many small metalic copper pieces and you put a good amount of acetic acid's aqueous solutions or house-hold vinegar.  WARNING!! If you desire a good experiment's evolution, you must fill NOT the vessel and you must clean the copper pieces just to bright the metalic surfaces.  Now, you let open the vessel at room temperature.    YOUR REMARKS  Lately, day par days the liquid rise its copper ions containt.  Many days later, you can note a pale greenish coloration.  Some months later, you can note a strong green hue.  Furthermore, the coloration show a stronger hue if you employed vinegar unless acetic acid's solution : vinegar containts other organic acids than acetic one lonely.  YOU SEEN IT!!  COPPER MAY UNDERGO CORROSION IN ACETIC MEDIA!!    HOW DO IT HAPPENS?  In the electrochemical series, copper result of one of chemical elements more noble than hydrogen.  So, you might state that not-oxidizing acidic solutions may not attacks copper bodies.  I remember you that air's oxygen also may acts as an oxidizing.  Thus, acidic media may permit oxygen's action.  If you permit the contact between acidic media and the air, you obtain a LATE BUT POSSIBLE corrosion's phenomena of copper bodies.    I hope this helps you.
b1ceb7c8481526a9137bbf36ef3f74aaaa	The reason has mainly to do with how OH forms compouds with other elements.  It is the oxygen that shares electrons with other atoms, not the hydrogen.  Thus, when OH combines with potassium to form potassium hydroxide, it is written KOH because K and O bond.  Writing KHO would be misleading because there is no bond between K and O.  This is almost always the case when OH bonds with other atoms, so hydroxide is written as OH because that is how it occurs in almost all chemical formulae.|`|1f92e6b0a28b055cb63ed3fc4999ab31aa	No whores in the chemistry world, just a bunch of social rejects|`|515520c752f4133ee59ea7409ab8e61caa	that's because its the IUPAC formation e.g H2SO4 IS TETRAOXOSULPHATE(VI) ACID   oxygen always comes first....|`|Lu5GiO6Taa	the heavier one is listed first

It is usually based on how much monetary damage and the number of deaths and how bad people suffer afterward. That is why there will never be another storm named Katrina, or Andrew or Camille.

They do this to avoid confusion.|`|3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	Hurricane names are retired if they're exceptionally destructive, at the request of the country or countries affected.
