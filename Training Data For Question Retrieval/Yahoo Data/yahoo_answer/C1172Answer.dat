MV0lMuDMaa	I so far only have two one of them means something and the other one is just a cool design.  I dont believe that every tattoo has to have some deep dark meaning you know?<br>  <br>  that gun one is sweet too :D|`|w8M8YmeIaa	mine means having strength and wisdom And lots of Faith|`|6mZJSqBgaa	Not all of my tattoos have "meaning".  I think they all represent me and compliment my body.  I dont need excuses to decorate myself ;)<br>  <br>  The ones that do have meaning are:<br>  a pink rose for my grandma<br>  an old school mom heart<br>  and the shape of texas with a sillouette of suburbia inside of it- it's my attempt at embracing my default environment.|`|TDtSZLmvaa	my lily on my foot is represents the relationship between me my mother and my sister.<br>  <br>  my butterfly is for a passed love because butterflies are supposed to represent those who have passed who come back to life to visit.<br>  <br>  and a star on my heel, is for my pap who also passed because it is also said that people who pass are one of the sparkling stars in the sky. (even tho everyone knows they arent)|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	My kids name!!!<br>  <br>  The love of my lifes name!!<br>  <br>  Butterflys for my grandma...she died & they were her favoriate thing ever!!<br>  <br>  I have my name with a rose...for me....<br>  <br>  I have stars on my neck, 3 of them...1 for each of my children...<br>  <br>  I have lost & broken with to shattered hearts, resembling my past....<br>  <br>  I have a lost love symbol on my  arm for my home boy that died...<br>  <br>  I love tatoo's but all mine mean something to me!!|`|6zblh7Tiaa	Your quoting Lord of War|`|nFpOWZy5aa	All of mine have meaning.  I have 9 butterflies on my back in honor of my sister who passed away.  Eventually it will be a full back piece with 22 butterflies for her age.<br>  I have angel wings on my ankle that I got with my best friend.  Her brother died 1 year before my sister died, and they were both 22.  So we believe our guardian angels are looking out for us.<br>  I have a cover-up of my ex's name on my hip.  The coverup is a sunset and heart and just really beautiful.  Getting the name was a mistake, but seeing the coverup reminds me of my mistakes and gives me hope for the future.  <br>  I'm planning on getting many more, but every one in my head has a special meaning.  Its a perminant thing so it needs to stand for something...|`|FDgHnvm3aa	I have a half sleeve on my leg.    a cross i did with a saftey pin (for the pain ive been through for my art)     a lotus for my grandma (who is living without the love of her life who died this year of pancreatic cancer at 55)    a nautical star, that will be joined by another. (one is purple one will be green The joker reminding me to always laugh and do what i feel is right)<br>  <br>  thats all for now|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i have 10 and they all mean something to me. i have a devil and an angel on my shoulders that represent my two 'sides', my nickname on my lower back, my zodiac sign and motto on my right side, my sons name with music notes and 4 hearts representing me, s/o, daughter, and son on my left side, an angel baby representing a miscarriage, my daughters name with tinkerbell on my ankle/calve, and 'so cal' on my feet cuz thats where im from.|`|swNzTwUfaa	I'll be getting a tattoo on Saturday! Woohoo!!! I believe that tattoos represent major events/representations of a person's life. In other words, they "record" a person's story. The tattoo I will be getting symbolizes "believing" and having faith in yourself. It's an angel reaching for a star.|`|VhHVjMe8aa	I have 3 and they all mean something!    I have a mom and baby penguin on one ankle, that's me and my youngest. I have 2 penguins on my other ankle, that's my 2 oldest kids. I have the letters J R A on my ring finger, that stands for Just Remember Asshole, so I don't forget never to get married again.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	i think it's stupid to have tattoos that are just pictures just because you like the pictures. I only have one so far and it's my daughters name with our pet snake weaved in and out of it|`|5507f1be5d18ddfd4ca76e1091810647aa	I have a Gemini symbol that forms a heart with my sons initials in it on my back. Pretty self explanatory I think. But I love it!!|`|qcGepiOJaa	i have none so i can't understand ur question lol
SL39cMqVaa	Any person's skin complexion can wear any color; Your skin's undertones are what determines what shade simply will look best. (For example, I am dark brown-skinned and look good in pink; but I think warm pink (with a little more red in it) looks better with my skin than pale baby pink, or hot pink.  Black, Navy Blue, Silver, White & Gold are ALWAYS elegant for prom; particularly if its a long Senior Prom gown or formal dress.  A soft pastel will look cute too for a short, less dressy Junior Prom dress; rose or baby pink, Champagne gold, peach, baby blue, butter yellow or mint green.  If you want to really go bright, I suggest maybe purple or orchid; maybe even turquoise, fuchsia or a pretty shade of Jade green.  (I personally detest red, but is looks hot on some people if the shade of red goes with their undertones.)  I suggest silver/platinum jewelry with diamonds (matches everything.)  Have someone do your makeup professionally (if you don't know a hairstylist who does makeup, or a professional makeup artist; go to a MAC or Chanel counter or some other upscale deparment store makeup counter to get your face made up, or to buy your makeup); try to match your eye shadow to your dress (if possible, get a soft shimmer  shadow with sheer glitter in it); line eyes with black liquid liner, mascara, & try false lashes for a glamorous look!  Get your hair styled in an up-do; and wear large diamond stud earrings if your dress is really elaborate, or long, chandelier earrings if you dress is plain.  Prom night is your night to SHINE!!!  Also, look online (try google.com to get images) to see celebrity pictures of other beautiful dark-skinned models and actresses dressed in gowns on 'the red carpet' to get ideas (Naomi Campbell, Kim Porter, June Sarpong, etc...)  Hope this was helpful!|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	a white or red prom dress would look cute beacause it wouls really make your skin color stand out and i think it would look really beautiful|`|OtqB24NVaa	a light/muted gold or baby blue|`|vOIER72saa	I think any pastel colors would be really pretty!|`|KncPJwIaaa	A purplish color dress|`|AA11707745	Coral pink or silver|`|qfSKgxDsaa	blue...on the darker side|`|CUEco2LEaa	I have a similar appearance and I love wearing colours like royal blue and different shades of purple. If you really want to stand out, colours like gold or red look amazing on darker skin tones. I would also recommend using an exfoliant and good cocoa butter, so your skin glows. This just sets the dress off, especially if you are wearing a sleeveless or strapless dress. Dark skin is beautiful and especially when it shines! Good luck and have a fun prom!|`|2X6kq9h9aa	TADA!!!!!

6wiRFrsoaa	If you want your hair to be a different color, you would have to bleach it first because it is black.

ZbQ5ucODaa	Try Biosilk's shine/frizz serum.  It will seal the cuticle so that when you go over it with the straightening iron it will be soft and silky.  Biosilk works with the heat of your hair dryer and straightener.  I think Kerastase also has a heat protectant spray which is supposed to be great (according to my hair dresser) but I haven't tried that one yet. I did try the tressame one and that one was worthless.|`|aHRZq6hlaa	3Y3 W00D U53 N305P0R1N 0R V453L1N3 0R P05518LY /\/\070R 01|_|`|aEpPt9koaa	Bumble and bumble have a good heat protectant. Aveda has a heat protectant spray that's also good. Its in their brillant line. I see you have a chi flat iron, chi has a silk serum that is also good. Have your tried that? Well those are my suggestions. And a little goes a long way. If you use too much product it builds up and that's probably what your flat iron is getting caught on.
1xwyCxdUaa	No.  Just because you see oil doesn't mean you need to wash it immediately.  Actually, the more you wash your face, the more oil it will product to counter-act the drying effects of the soap.  <br>  <br>  I use oil absorbing sheets.  They get rid of the oil but don't dry your skin out.|`|7CF1WKjMaa	Don't use it everyday, just use it once or twice a week. But if you use it twice dont use it in a row skip a day.|`|j3Gs9wkeaa	It depends. What type of skin do u have? Dry? Oily? Combo? Personally neutrogena oil free acne wash( never tried the bar) dried my skin alot. Like my skin would crack n hurt. Overwashing isn't good for ur skin.  Don't get too obsessed about the oil.  If it bothers u alot try clean n clear oil blotting sheets. Those things worked great for me. I don't use them anymore cuz ever since I had my baby my skin isn't as oily for some reason...<br>  <br>  I clean my face with dove Beaty bar soap. I don't get excessive oil  no acne anymore n it's gentle on my skin. Removes makeup too <br>  <br>  I use a washcloth with the soap n it acts as an exfoliant. I wash my face once a day<br>  <br>  Good luck
O1wh9PyXaa	I would suggest that you first of all, find a stylist that not only does the weaving, but one that knows how to care for your hair, with proven success. Ask around. This would include deep conditioners, not over-processing your hair, trim back the dead ends, or giving you a managable cut that will thicken your hair.  Because ultimately, this is about making your hair healthy, and just it looking healthy, right.  <br>  <br>  In the sewing process, most of your natural hair is braided, which provides it with a rest from all the tugging and pulling.  According to how well your stylist can braid, and sews in the desired style (because not all sewing is equal) you can have a desired look without detection. <br>  The braids should be small and thin - in a pattern that contours the head without adding extra bumps.  That is the worst.<br>  <br>  Gluing provides you with a smoother look, because the waft is actually glued to scalp - this I don't recommend because it does block your pores, and sticks to the hair.  It is removable, and it does get looser quicker than the sewing because any oil-based hair care product causes the glue to loosen, as well as the daily care of the hair.  In some sewing weaves they will glue on the last piece or so, in order to give a flawless finish. This is not so bad.<br>  <br>  Your hair looked good with the flat-twists, and with the straw-set.  If you can afford it, I would just find a good stylist and take care of my own hair. Adding only a few pieces for fullness, while still being able to care for your hair.  Also try some natural products, like that of Carol's Daughter - www.carolsdaughter.com -Good Luck<br>  <br>  Here is a site for pieces of human hair:<a href="http://store.goldenmartbeautysupply.com/7piex.html" rel="nofollow">http://store.goldenmartbeautysupply.com/...</a>|`|OMKDEun3aa	check into getting hair infusions the are not injections they add hair to the ends it is they take a little little section and fuse the two ends together { kind of like soddering them together} when done you trim them out or they fall out they last a long time and i recommend it do human hair only you can wash, blow-dry, curl them ..  real pricey but so worth it|`|N48qV69daa	Damn you are beautiful! I love your hair straight, even not styled!  I heard sew on is the strongest hold, my sister just go the sew on, and the only down side she said is her head was so sore the next day. Glue on is good and less painful, but wont last as long. Good luck hun!|`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	I wouldnt' recommend gluing or infusion, unless you want some form of hair breakage. I had a glue in a loooong time ago and when my hair dresser took it out it caused breakage in my crown area and I could never get that part of my hair healthy again for the next 10 years because it always broke off in that part. The only reason it stopped breaking was because I went natural, and now my crown area is the most sensitive part of my scalp. <br>  <br>  If you're only thinking about getting hair added to a few spots then consider clip-ins; they are probably the healthiest for your hair. Check hsn.com and qvc.com because they have them in all colors and for African-American hair (although, not for afro-textured hair).|`|KGppArcfaa	Both of those options suck in my opinion, but I guess the better one is the sew in. Its uncomfortable as hell I might as well tell you, and when you take it out, your guna lose a lot of hair, but its a lot better than glue.<br>  <br>  If I were you i'd consider microlinks, they dont damage, the hair is reusable, and they look more natural. you can buy kits and do it yourself (with someones help) or you can get a professional to put it in, its way better. Or get clip ins, they are even better<br>  <br>  I think you look best in the last pic btw =)|`|7CF1WKjMaa	I really like your hair in the straight and style section, but if i were you i would get the extensions, they are easy to  put in and take out, and it wont damaged your hair or rip it out.<br>  So i would get the sew in ones<br>  <br>  but get a  trim before you get the extensions|`|dUNKIA6baa	wow!! idk wich eva hurts da lest..|`|Dm3AHmG5aa	Well, I usually don't recommend the glue, because it can pull your hair out when removed the wrong way. The sew in will only damage your hair if you don't take care of your hair. And if you just want to add a few weave strips for fullness it should not take that long. I would recommend getting your dead ends cut off because this will prevent your hair from growing, and also get a good hot oil treatment this will help before and after you remove your extensions. Right now I currently have four tracks glued in the front of my hair for color because I did'nt want to dye my hair anymore. I used the glue because I know how to remove it, I wash my hair and let the conditioner sit in it, which helps loosen the glue almost completely. I have had a full head of extensions in the past, I choose to get it sewn in because it last longer,and if taken care of correctly it helps your hair grow, to prevent damage I took care of my scalp as if I would without the extensions, once they were removed I put a hot oil treatment on my hair. basically its fine to glue or sew it in depending on what works best for you. GOOD LUCK and hope this helped
OHs8yJiOaa	Totally depends on specific models and what your individual purposes are. Brand shouldn't be the first and foremost reason for your decision.<br>  <br>  Ray-ban generally has more options and is more likely to have things for daily casual and/or fashion use.<br>  <br>  Oakley excels with sports-related stuff, and has a greater variety of lens options. They also tend to be a bit better about physical protection in their designs. Some of their lenses are hydrophobic, etc. They have a lot fewer wire frame options than Ray-Ban and their wires tend to be on the pricier side (but less likely to be trendy in appearance). Some of their lenses can be more likely to scratch.<br>  <br>  Anyway, depends on what specific models you're considering and why. Which brand happens to make something is farther down the decision totem pole. Sunglasses are something with various functions to fulfill first and foremost, and different models from different brands do different things to different degrees.|`|MmmcKU52aa	Rayban<br>  oakleys are ugly.|`|8oovDGZgaa	oakley|`|slppTZi1aa	Oakley fo sho.

tRNtFNHLaa	yes, but that would damage your hair alot.|`|1o6bzLVbaa	you can if you want to, but it damages your hair, you should try to avoid it, but if you have to, it's up to you.|`|PLDRCAWlaa	Bleaching Hair breaks it.<br>  Just dye it.|`|kkdv4tkVaa	Noooooooooooooo, is will go strawy, i suggest gradually putting highlights in and building the colour up. If you bleach your hair, it will go ginger and then you will have to keep dying it the colour you want almost every 3-6 weeks. As you build up the highlights, do the underneath too otherwise you will be stuck with gingery hair until it grows through.|`|xcCSnsRWaa	if you do that your hair will be forever damaged|`|NTEuxMVmaa	yes or it might turn orange|`|tSWTIcOtaa	Well, you cannot lift color with color, so if you're wanting to dye your hair a lighter shade than it is now, you're going to have to bleach it first, or the dye you use may not show up.<br>  Bleaching can be very damaging to your hair, but when done right can give you the results you want with as little damage neccessary.<br>  I HIGHLY recommend that for the bleaching, you seek out a professional hair stylist that has a track record in bleaching and coloring.<br>  Good luck!! :)<br>  ??

7JcMXoMmaa	You can do this very easily luckily!<br>  I did this 3 times already- I have very dark brown hair like yours and light skin. I dye my hair a lighter brown too. So what you do is make your you get the right dye and follow ALL of the directions! Don't wash your hair with shampoo the next day too. Don't wash your hair out too late or it may turn out too light then you'll have a major disaster. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
MnkUnbLKaa	um really you shouldnt have used that much colour in a short time.  If you want to tone down the red you need to go to the OPPOSITE colour of the spectrum, ie blue tones to get rid of red.  Sallys do quite a good colour stripper try that first.  Then wash your hair. But please! use a lot of conditioner aftewards and treatments.  After that maybe go to a hairdresser b cause they will know the right tone to put on and can colour correct, it can cost up to ￡100 though.  Red is the hardest colour to get out.  If your desperate maybe try dying over blue -black?|`|jkkCfu6Haa	well, i had the same problem but i had like a orange blonde. so i dyed it to a BLACK BROWN. i dyed it like a week ago and it toned down to my nautral color. with is the same as yours.<br>  -hope it works out.<br>  <br>  and dying it fromt he box frys you hair [if you didnt know] so next time you dye your hair, wait a few weeks or at least 2.|`|c4ded2672a1b6461a7cf5ac2f327a09faa	Save you self from this hair disaster, go to the salon. When you want something done right always go to the professionals. I have been there and learned my lesson. Go.........now..........before your stress level rises from looking in the mirror. I'm sure you will be beautiful again but just go to the salon. Good luck!|`|vzWnzCFEaa	My advice: RUN TO A SALON SCREAMING.<br>  This happened to my mom. It was the funniest thing ever. Red can be a nice colour sometimes. But if it IS too bright you could try washing your hair a few times (tis what my mom did) but it'd be best just to go to a hairdressers. And even if you don't it shouldn't last too long because bleach blonde is a strong colour and goes through everything (though I don't know if it works after loads of layers of hair dye).|`|7kMCzTVcaa	First off...color in a box...is a bad idea...they fry your hair and fade quickly, which in this case might be a good thing!  Red is the most difficult color to remove from your hair...To neutralize red you need to use a color opposite the color wheel.<br>  The opposite of Red is Green so a green base color would neutralize that red color for you. Now without seeing it I can't properly evaluate it. Many color lines don't have green base colors anymore though so you would need to mix a gold base & blue base (Ash) make sure it's not blue-violet....to make green. You would be toning it here so I wouldn't use anything stronger than 10 volume developer...try it on a test strand for lets say 10 minutes and then rinse and blow it dry and see how the result is....if it's still red you can always put more back on for 10 more minutes and see the result....it depends on how red it is and what you are looking to achieve. Stay within the current level of your haircolor if you used level 6 then use a level 6 with a green base to neutralize it.<br>  <br>  One of the fundamental rules of color is that color doesn't lift or lighten previously colored hair so that is a no, no. The only thing that lightens already artificially colored hair is bleach.|`|a7c44ca57676a0db1e3d8ad650499612aa	I would be finding the closet hair place and get the real strong stuff put on your hair or go to Sally's and get like and ion permanent brown you need some extra strength stuff.  I would stop adding store bought color to your hair and get the real hair color that might help you because the store bought stuff isn't really strong enough to fix problems. GOOD LUCK|`|zWo03iLNaa	If you want your hair to look normal go to a salon. Its going to be super expensive. Other than that I would say just wash wash wash and hopefully some will come out and you could re do it just a normal brown color or something. Good luck. That stinks.
B2LiCx5qaa	Do these women you know have the traditional red dot (tika) on their forehead? If not, the red hair strands could be a substitute or variant of the red dot.<br>  <br>  The red hair strands may be a symbol of sacred purity and power. Historically, more of the central part of the hair would be dyed, but maybe it has been reduced to a set of strands for more subtlety or assimilation reasons.|`|WwVHWz5saa	What the hell?

KcZpH6gkaa	You really shouldn't wash your hair more than every 3rd day. Every other day max. It is true that you lose the natural oils.

Yeah shampooing is really bad for your hair try and find a mild or moisturizer shampoo.  Even then its best to water it down. Personally i find it better to use dry shampoo inbetween washes, its so much kinder.  Also rather than waste money or expensive conditioners, i buy hair oil (olive oil treament) from a local afro care shop (although im white with bleach blonde hair).  the best thing to do is put it on DRY hair, leave it on, add heat from a hair dryer, - this helps the oil enter the hair shaft, then after a good while, at least 45 mins, use some shampoo on your hair DRY, if needed spritz with water. After this wash it out. This is a really good moisturising treatment. good luck|`|236548a8801617d43a073b2dd4d83f35aa	Yeah, I have heard that washing your hair everyday may cause it to dry out, but it actually can cause your hair to produce extra oil....it really doesn't make since.  I have to wash my hair everyday or it looks dirty.  I take a break and don't wash it if I am not going anywhere important.  Meaning if I am just sitting around the house or going to the grocery store or something.  It is better for your hair to not wash it everyday.<br>  <br>  In answer to your question, you should definetly invest in some moisturinzing conditioner.  There are lots of at home remedies...I'm pretty sure one of them is mayonnaise.  Sounds disgusting I know, but many are known to work, and alot of times the same stuff is in products you use at home.  You should just do an internet search online for home remedies for dry hair, and use your common sense.<br>  <br>  By the way you did not say if you use hair gels or styling products of any kind.  If you do that really could be your main problem.  Often styling products contain alcohol which dries your hair out severly, and can cause hair loss.  If you insist on using styling products try to find ones that are alcohol free.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.  :)|`|ec693849207b8aa483fd9f3a60db384faa	my hair was the same way you can do two things.<br>  1. get a product called cholesteral <br>  2. go to the store get a product from the assuie company you kno purple bottle with a kangaroo on it called 3 minute mirical its like 3 bucks its amazin and u can get it at any store|`|pvDVFrKwaa	some people say to skip shampoo every other day. you might try a deep conditioning conditioner. Mayonnaise though gross has been known to help.|`|OgaAlpg9aa	yes... massage ur scalp with a hair oil after warming it up jst a lil bit. Make sure u giv urself a good satisfying massage.<br>  Try natural oils for ur hair. Olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil... all work great.

tYO2Ir1oaa	Wow, you have exactly the hair that i have longed for my whole life!! lol. I have blonde, wavy hair that i straighten every day (what a pain!) and have been trying to grow long since i can remember, but it never grows much past shoulder-length before breaking. Don't cut your hair!! u might regret it, and it took all that time to grow it! Often, u see women with hair down to their butt and it looks horrible because the condition is bad and u can see all the broken hair and split ends, and it looks especially bad if they're middle-aged or old, like mutton dressed as lamb. But in your 20s and 30s i think it's fine, and if u like ur hair like that then that's what matters. Only cut your hair if YOU want to, not because someone else is pressuring you to. Who knows, ur sis-in-law might even be a tad envious of your hair, and worse still, u might end up resenting her if u cut it and hated it. <br>  <br>  You could always keep it long and just bring it a little further up your back (like just under your bra line or something). That would still look lovely and long, i'm sure xxxx|`|R7ACldBKaa	that's kinda pushing it, long hair is good, but it should be about midway between the shoulder + butt, depending on your proportions of course. you dont want to be sitting on your hair everytime you sit down...|`|MnkUnbLKaa	i thnk hair to your butt is too long, it is at risk of looking lank and kinda geeky.  I think below waist is too much and over powering.  I mean that long and you can hardly hold a style or wave.  you need to get something that flatters your face|`|56nOQvnWaa	Personally, thats WAY to long, it reminds me of a hippy! and its so outdated! I say cut it atleast two or three inchs and then it wouldn't be too bad!|`|SBW3P8lUaa	I like long hair, but not really all the way to the butt.  I like it around the middle of the back.  Long and straight is nice.  Be careful with too short b/c some people don't look good with really short hair.  <br>  <br>  Ultimately though, if you like your hair you should keep it.  You would be sad if you chopped it all off and you didn't like it.|`|TrdmZAMdaa	i think when i see somebody with long hair theey look like hypies... likt to the boobs is okay but to the but.... no way|`|Ake3x3t1aa	thats the same with me i prefer my hair long cuz i could style it more|`|bwjf8D31aa	i prefer sex

MmfMJq9Paa	get bangs and whisp them along the angle of your face all the way down on the sides. that's all you need is a newer style for fine hair.<br>  Root Volume will help also. good luck!! :)|`|3f84c73de2c0e31943a5c269dafcd272aa	DON'T I REPEAT DON'T CURL IT. You can try letting it grow out like 2 in past the shoulders and getting some layers not a lot.|`|qV70OQ91aa	Definitely grow your hair past your shoulders. once that happens get it cut in layers.

Instead of volumizing stuff then just try a little back-combing at the roots that will really build up your hair.<br>  If not then try hair extensions, they can look great and make a huge difference to your look!|`|0xU3YhGhaa	try getting soft side bangs, i think they'll look awesome on you  ! :)<br>  Oh and if you want some volume, try teasing your hair. You comb your hair towards your roots which causes volume. This doesn't cause your hair to become thinner! Hope i helped :)|`|lSr7u0mSaa	try teasing it .

0M6DSPQPaa	Wow, why would she get those operations done?  She had a small nose and full lips to begin with.  She definitely looked a lot prettier before.  Much more naturally pretty.  She is a bit fakey and plastic looking, but that's what a lot of people are attracted to-the barbie doll image.|`|pMtMsbBnaa	I think she looks pretty in both, but prettier before the surgery.  She looks too fake in the after-shots.  I don't really get the point of having the surgery if she was already young and pretty......|`|xJS3BdUNaa	I agree.  when ever I see a pic of her or see her on tv she looks weird to me.  <br>  <br>  That being said, she was out of this world beautiful in Transformers.  I loved her in that movie.<br>  <br>  So, I guess I don't know how I feel about her.|`|SUMV525Aaa	Well I can see how people find her attractive, but I don't know..people tend to make her out to be prettier than she is. I mean I think she's pretty, but I'd never call her stunning|`|yeQjkrNcaa	she's got an absolutely gorgeous face.. (the lips are slightly too big, but no ones perfect) and her body is amazing now she's thinned down.<br>  <br>  She just has noo dress sense or style what so ever.|`|7FfbOoRsaa	megan fox is one of my favorite actresses, shes beautiful|`|ukDA5nFyaa	true, she looks better before.<br>  but i still think she's the hottest woman in hollywood (:|`|FFE9Qztzaa	She has a cute face i'll admit. But she looks so much better on her "before" face. Her "natural" lips looked so great.. She looked like she was herself.<br>  But upon watching the second photo (AFTER), really plastic-y and her nose looked just fine as it was.<br>  <br>  <br>  Its quite sad how some celebrities will try to conform how society wants and perceives them to be. A standard theyd have to live up to|`|m5NV1GBUaa	She's really pretty no mader what. But I am pretty sure it was just her make-up in the second one.|`|k07IyDvwaa	she does look fake, like a plastic barbie<br>  <br>  though she does look pretty good, maybe thats why they say shes "hot"<br>  <br>  help me out?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmY3RRcOA8Hi7rhY84pyDf_rxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090227155320AAXUO6T">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|nqkXE1cUaa	She looks fine after but better before.|`|5hIned1caa	i think she is so attractive!|`|RvVvaVsAaa	i do :)|`|JDogbPg6aa	She's a lot prettier than before but any guy would probably go out with her because she is famous, voted for one of the prettiest women in the world, and I don't know why but a lot of guys go for fake looking girls.|`|QW4jdXGjaa	I agree, now she just looks fake and like everyone else in the movies. She's not completely unattractive now, I mean she has a healthy body from what I've seen. But she looked so much prettier and natural before.|`|30115ffe6a4ae9195c2e11d0888849e8aa	if people already have naturally good looks, they shouldnt be complaining .she was obviously ungrateful for that, to have to look even "hotter"|`|dyXN0grpaa	She just looks fake... I guess thats what people define as "hot" now a days. <br>  Honestly Id rather look ugly, then the know statistic "hot" <br>  <br>  I think she looked very pretty when she was o'natural...|`|KxqEYBWhaa	I do think she looked cuter before...but it doesn't take away the fact that she is still super beautiful now even after whatever she did to herself!|`|ArFFUPTBaa	shes pretty.<br>  kinda jealous..=/|`|F3PEEMK3aa	wow youre right! she was very pretty before|`|SWHFvXI0aa	i'd go out with her
wwSz1ht5aa	Just go to your local craft store, like hobby lobby or Jo-Ann fabrics, and buy some of the pretty ribbon they have there, They will have a whole wall of different kinds to choose from. Just have them cut off the length you need, and then tie it in a bow around your bun/ponytail.<br>  <br>  Also, even stores like walmart sell the ribbon! Its easy <3<br>  <br>  <br>  Or there are tons of websites with pre made ones, just google cheerleading bows ! <br>  heres a good site with cute bows that i found:<br>  <a href="http://www.mybowstore.com/category_25/Cheerleader-Hair-Bows.htm?gclid=CPjs_Ib4_ZgCFQu-GgodNxQNoA" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybowstore.com/category_25/Ch...</a><br>  <br>  good luck :D|`|29EORG8Iaa	American Apparel and Target stores
EW4zX8lnaa	Yes, in fact tanning is often prescribed by dermatologists for severe skin problems. If you only have mild acne then it won't make a HUGE difference but you will notice|`|Lg6Y8HdZaa	ONLY slightly, but it is also bad for your skin (wrinkles, fine lines etc) no matter what age you are. especially in the long run, but even now.|`|rghk8yMeaa	if you put a thin layer over your face, it wont burn but yes most definately it should clear up the pimples. not the blackheads though.|`|0fygxRHLaa	take a greasy pan and put it in the oven|`|lnRMmSeyaa	no tanning burns and dries your skin so your acne will be really red and dry|`|pMtMsbBnaa	No but it will be less noticeable.|`|B1AKZY0Eaa	No but being a cannibal will|`|RnHDnSgPaa	i dont think so|`|ePcNVX10aa	I don't think so..  I think that the salt water from the beach helps the skin.  Sometimes acne can be related to certain foods you eat.  You can actually find out if that's the case from a dermatologist.  I would recommend keeping your hair clean and away from your face.  Making sure you wash your face at least twice a day.  Do not put lotion on your face if you don't need to and if you do only on the places where you really need it.  Keep your hands away from your face. A lot of people do not realize how dirty your hands are even if you wash them regularly.|`|WUUXLvdnaa	it wont because it will irritate the skin, and instead of your skin fighting off the bacteria causing the acne, it will be busy repairing itself against the sun damage.|`|fbHA13meaa	no, but it will help blend it better so the red and stuff isnt so contrasting. if u have red on white it is very contrasting. if u have red on brownish tanish it isnt that bad|`|dgzbj9ujaa	No! If anything your pimples will just shrivel up and people will think you stuck dead things on your face!|`|1gjk5DhZaa	nooooo!<br>  and its actually awful for your skin<br>  and increases the chance for cancer|`|4312a05a5c516ed5d819dac35863d3e1aa	yes but the risks are worse so i but strongly not recommend it! Go to a dermatologists!|`|0nYsPzlPaa	no it actually might make the acne u have now, worsen|`|sE2RH0A7aa	No, you'll just be another fake baker.|`|Nf6ybJzUaa	it wont|`|ergk5yLiaa	nah it wont|`|capqMpiCaa	uh no, it will do nothing for your acne. If anything it will damage the cells on your face, causing freckles, etc.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	yes|`|nqkXE1cUaa	No, it will most likely just give you skin cancer.<br>  Here are some ways to visibly reduce you acne.<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/tips_2193_11.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/tips_2193_11.html</a>|`|AA10731562	No it will just hide it for a while then when your tans gone they'll appear again|`|ixOE0onnaa	it might.|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	no, they will just get tan

AND ICLUDING IT IS LIKE REALLY BAD FOR YOUR ARMS. ITS BETR TO USE NAIR ONCE IN A WHILE. ITS A HAIR REMOVER.

Why would you dye them, waste the time and money.. Just shave them with an electric razor so taht you'll just have a 'trimmed' look to your arms, and you won't look like you shave them. Plus you won't have to keep shaving them every other day. Just every two weeks maybe. That's what I do, always.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
r4i7xPnMaa	I think your skin just might be getting rid of all the gunk from before. This is normal. Give your skincare routine about 4 weeks before you start to expect results. If you don't see any improvement by the sixth week, try something else. <br>  Also, you should be washing your face when you wake up and before you go to bed, not just rinsing it. If you go to bed with everything from the day before on your face, you're just giving it 8 hours to settle in your pores, which could be making your skin worse.|`|BvjPU3wkaa	Keep it up.  Skin cell renewal runs on a cycle so it will take some time for your skin to adjust.  If after a month your skin still isn't cooperating you need to start looking at what you are currently using on your face and whether or not it suits your skin type.|`|SpWmhUa3aa	Okay i can see ur suffering and the exact same thing happened to me!<br>  I stopped using all that face crap cuz that doesnt work,so instead i use a loofah(a facial sponge)and non-creamy soap! Oh yeah,one more thing don't worry so much about ur skin cuz freaking out too much will<br>  cause u stress and you get more breakouts mkay! rock on G!|`|zWo03iLNaa	Your underlying acne is probably just coming up to the surface of your face. Keep taking good care of it. Things are always worse before they get better.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	Yeah skin getting suddenly worse is a bad sign, try a differnt brand or formulation.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	no the stuff ur using is apparently wrong for ur skin type so try somethin els|`|ad9a3HBJaa	your skin has to get used to the routine you have going on, you doing the right thing it just takes time make sure after you wash your face, close your pores by rinsing with cold water..and try to keep your hair out of your face the oils are not good for your skin at all and never touch your face! even if you wash your hands get in the habit of never touching your face... i really hope i helped Good Luck|`|yNwSeNbhaa	It takes your skin a month to get used to a new product, so if you're still breaking out after that, change products. <br>  In my own personal experience, some products unclog my pores and clear them out (like the body shop's tea tree oil line) so I get worse for a while and once that is over I have pretty clear skin.|`|Zlv8l75baa	Sometimes when you try a better skin care regiment, acne can start to "pop up," but sometimes it's just the cleansers trying to get rid of the acne.  I would say to keep it up, but if the acne gets worse, it wouldn't hurt to talk to a dermatologist.|`|xe6FZyI1aa	one of my friends' faces is like that. when you wash your face alot alot, it can open your pores more or something like that... and then leave you more prone to infection (wich is breaking out, basically). so i'd see a dermatologist or something.|`|Ajz5hyXJaa	you may be drying out ur skin too much or ur skin could be too sensitive<br>  get a non comedogenic (won't clog pores) moisturizer <br>  overdrying your skin causes ur body to bring out more oil to make up for your dry skin if this is not the case your sking may be sensitive to the products or its ur underlying acne rising to the surface|`|sOkTUYq7aa	only exfoliate onoce a week. And it could be because you're scrubbing too hard or cleaning too much<br>  I would suggest to continue this routine.  It can also be that your skin is bringing up all the toxins, and then later it will be better|`|eH54r81Aaa	Thats normal.<br>  Its like a shot, when they give it to you they give you some of the disease to learn how to fight it off.<br>  Keep it up ok?<br>  :)
lTDeZ0Obaa	As someone who has had MULTIPLE family members with skin cancer, as well as being a nurse who has worked with cancer patients who have melanoma, I strongly encourage you NOT to go to tanning beds. These are far worse than baking in the sun, which is not good for you either. Skin cancer comes from sun exposure, tanning beds are just worse because it is such a concentrated exposure. All of my family members who have skin cancer got it from sun exposure and NEVER from tanning (laying and baking) in the sun. They have found a significant increase in skin cancer in general, but specifically malignant melanoma, among those who tan at tanning beds and it's mainly among YOUNG WOMEN!!! <br>  <br>  I have seen patients have surgeries for melanoma that leave them with a deformed appearance...is this worth it for the sake of fake baking? I have also known patients who died from melanoma! Again, worth it? My father is currently undergoing treatment for skin cancer, not melanoma, just standard skin cancer. He applies a topical chemotherapeutic agent to his face. His skin is cracking and peeling, it is bright red, it oozes. It is ugly looking, people stare, not to mention it is painful. But, it is what he has to do to treat the skin cancer. It's the third time he has been through this treatment. <br>  <br>  People make the mistake of thinking skin cancer is no big deal, but it is a big deal, people do die from it, and the treatments and surgeries themselves can be very disfiguring. You fake bake now for beauty, but you won't be beautiful later when you are struck with skin cancer! Just a warning.<br>  <br>  There are a number of sunless tanning creams and lotions available...just find the one that works the best for you. Much better for beautiful, healthy skin for a long time!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://chemistry.about.com/od/howthingsw..." rel="nofollow">http://chemistry.about.com/od/howthingsw...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sunless.com/application/tips...." rel="nofollow">http://www.sunless.com/application/tips....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lifescript.com/Body/Looks/Ski..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lifescript.com/Body/Looks/Ski...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fakebake.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fakebake.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americarx.com/Products/17486...." rel="nofollow">http://www.americarx.com/Products/17486....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7P..." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7P...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/qxp143070_33318..." rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/qxp143070_33318...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-MicroMi..." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-MicroMi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugsdepot.com/viewitem.php/d..." rel="nofollow">http://www.drugsdepot.com/viewitem.php/d...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j..." rel="nofollow">http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://yoospot.stores.yahoo.net/epilbron..." rel="nofollow">http://yoospot.stores.yahoo.net/epilbron...</a>|`|mBHQEzd1aa	I don't think tanning beds are good for you.  Go get a spray tan instead.|`|RMppfinbaa	Should you purposely go out of your way to get melanoma? Buddy, I've had two family members who have died because of melanoma, a serious skin cancer. I have another one in the hospital because of the same cancer. If you are willing to put your family through that pain, willing to age prematurely, excited about getting wrinkles and age spots, go for it.<br>  And saying that you'll only go once isn't going to happen. You have to go at least 4 times to start seeing a bit of color.<br>  Don't do it.|`|60ApQsGOaa	skin cancer is true, but don't think you'll get it after a few sessions. People who go tanning everyday for years on end get it. My sister, as well as I go for a month or two to get a nice tone and that's it. Do I have  cancer? No. You just go in once a day for like 10 to 15 minutes. Once you get your desired tone, then it's done.|`|oQQ9DF9oaa	One word....<br>  <br>  <br>  .... Cancer.|`|AA10771601	nah, it's really bad for you and you age faster.|`|mBVXgRLFaa	umm yeah just like once a week or something would give you a little color. tanning is fine in moderation. anyone who tells you otherwise obviously knows nothing about it.|`|B1CH2L26aa	If you go very seldomly then it's fine<br>  <br>  Spray one's are best, at a good salon so you don't look fake<br>  <br>  But the tanning creams usually go streaky so I wouldn't really suggest them|`|b1NMh5K2aa	Dont risk it..Fake tan is so much better for you.

GOOD LUCK...|`|IuEzEIiraa	No, and tanning at tanning beds makes your skin look artificially yellow-orangeish. <br>  <br>  It's also not good for you. Only do it if you really think you need it.

AA11447210	They are worn it sounds like, so save them for around the house or when you're gettin' dirty (not school/work or any place you want to dress nice).<br>  <br>  You could also consider donating them to Goodwill, Salvation Army, or any other charity in your area that accepts donated clothing.

But don't bleach it, because it could hurt your skin. Use a light brown hair dye. It works!<br>  <br>  No, it's not a myth. I have pictures to prove that it does grow back thicker.|`|IQ0MjIqDaa	I have a question - how old are you? My daughter had the same problem up until she turned 16; then, the hair just mysteriously went away.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't do anything to it, personally, and just accept it as part of who I am. But if it effects your self-esteem, you might want to try waxing or electrolysis (lasts longer). You can get up to a month or more from either, and electrolysis  is painless.|`|MWIv6KTjaa	waxing reduces the texture of the hair. shaving doesnt take the root out of the skin. By waxing the wax takes the root out and it makes the root weak and when you wax every 4 to 6 weeks the hair will be weaker. and the hair wont show. so i say get them waxed.|`|SPBrhbHkaa	shavee themm! it feels so good and they are so smooth...and by the way by shaving or waxing it doesnt grow back darker or longer thts a myth and dont use any hair removers they can eat through ur skin and burn it so if anythin shave or wax :]|`|tC1JNMOiaa	shaving works for most people (even me when i used to)<br>  if you keep it up and shave them like you shave your legs or underarms its totally fine<br>  ive never tried waxing but the only thing i can think is if you have that much hair, it might bleed little|`|1gjk5DhZaa	do it do it do it!<br>  <br>  i shave mine,<br>  it gets annoying to constantly shave them,<br>  and my friend waxes hers, and they hardly grow back so do it:]|`|ntVWUYF2aa	no. let it grow. i know a ton of girls at my school have have quite a lot of hair growing on their arms but they're so pretty and sweet that no one cares:)|`|gokbhnhhaa	Well if I were you I wouldn't wax them because that would hurt like HELL!

zfuem0oaaa	I used to have bad acne and tried a lot of stuff. Clinique Acne Solutions and Acnefree both had positive affects on my acne (don't use them at the same time though) however these products might not work for you. All skin is different and you have to learn through trial and error what will be best. Use different spot treatments (one containing Salicylic Acid as a main ingredient, another Benzoyl Peroxide, another Tea Tree Oil, and another Sulphur). Test each spot treatment on a SINGLE pimple and see which one has the most positive results. THats one quick test, but that may get expensive.<br>  <br>  One of the best things you can do for your skin is to prevent any more pimples. Keep your skin clean. This does not mean washing your face constantly and drying it out, this means washing your face every night (you could wash in the mornings too, but I find thats not necessary, just a personal preference) and after your face is washed tone your skin. Pure jojoba oil tends to have great results on people. Your skin may purge for a week or two (that's what happened with mine, don't worry though, it won't be terrible or cystic or anything bad like that) but afterwards Jojoba oil gets EVERYTHING out of your pores. However it's not drying (which is good) because when skin is dry dead skin can clog pores and also your skin will try to overcompensate for the lost oil by making a LOT of extra oil. Always moisturize your skin in the morning! Thats very important in making sure you skin doesn't dry out.<br>  <br>  Along with keeping up a skincare regimen try some internal methods- like drinking a lot more water, drinking lemon juice morning and evenings, drinking surplus amounts of herbal tea, eating more apples and garlic, cutting down on/avoiding dairy, and too much peanut butter can cause acne (its rich in Omega 6 and since our body already gets enough of that omega, it can result in a breakout). I started taking birth control pills and that cleared up my acne. ALso taking flaxseed oil pills or omega 3 fish oil pills (both high in omega 3 which our bodys need more of) will have very positive results in your health and can help your skin.<br>  <br>  So, the best thing I can tell you is to cleanse, tone, treat/prevent acne at night with a light medicated face lotion all over, moisturize in the morning, and also take care of yourself internally.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Nobody deserves to have acne so I hope I an help you clear your skin in any way|`|3MFplBN3aa	im having that problem, and out family dosent have that much money and i stuck with aveno foam wash and a clean and clear anti pimple moisturizer. I alternate my products to, so i dont get used to them.|`|fURZEyDuaa	well my best offer is that if you dont like products the most effective way would be to boil a kettle and while the steam is coming out scrub you face with a hot damp cloth while over the steam and then throw a cold clothe over it to close your pores it works really well :)<br>  <br>  or try proactive if its bad acne it works too :)|`|IuEzEIiraa	Go to your doctor and get Duac, it's only 5% benzoyl peroxide but it works REALLY well. Just put lotion on before you put Duac on, and your skin won't dry out.|`|WGka5swJaa	<a href="http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/----" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/...</a>    try this website it has a lot of good info

ibtLgY5Xaa	The first answer is good, an internship will get you connections, but not money. You aren't paid to be an intern.<br>  To get money, you should try to design some stuff from your friends.

This will also get you sewing experience, so you can kill two birds with one stone.<br>  Also, put your designs and stuff on a blog, the more people that see your stuff the better.

n8VlnckAaa	drink lots of water, it flushes out the system naturally, what works for very oily skin is proper care. (i used to use things like dettol soap and let it dry on my skin for an hour or so and then resoap it and rinse (this worked wonders!) or handwash if i was out of my regular things, now my skin is so self regulatory i only use soap! i was the only one in my entire family of 6 who never had acne!)<br>  natural porridge oats, if you mix some in a bowl with water, use an old toothbrush and scrub your face 2x per week with it, you'll feel the difference in no time. natural egg white, if you beat it for a minute or 2 and apply it to face as mask (maybe with half a teaspoon lemon juice) it helps to tighten pores so that less grease is on the skin to mix with any bacteria...and in so doing, less pimples. try this, if it doesnt work, i'll eat my shorts... *wink* ps. be careful with lemon juice, use it in drops, because it may dry out pimples but it can and will irritate the skin and cause itchy, blotchy redness and patches!! so, use it in liquid form diluted with, as i suggested, egg white. also, apricots, if mashed, they not only tighten pores but take away scars and blemishes. i wouldnt try toothpaste if i was you, but hey...others have from what i see in other replies. best you can do is ongoing care, oats, its extremely useful and not only that its low cost and lasts for absolutely months. best wishes...|`|R75tldc8aa	Toothpaste does help dry it out.<br>  Another solution is to make a paste out of water and baking soda, apply that and leave it overnight.<br>  I use Clean & Clear Fast Action treatment cream and that works quite well for me :) It reduces redness and size quite quickly.<br>  Just DON'T POP IT until it's a proper whitehead - if you pop it before then it will go red and possibly get infected.

However, it also killed off the majority of terrestrial and a lot of marine species. This allowed the roles of the remaining organisms to shift, giving some species that were underling the chance to become top predators. This extinction helped to form the organisms we see in the world today. Also, this created boundary lines within the oceans that act as a natural boundary to help separate species of fish. <br>  <br>  Can't help with the asteroid theory, sorry.|`|qnZk5uSCaa	i see u have no answers yet the category could be why!!!!
naPq2mbtaa	Zit Prevention Plan<br>  <br>  Preventing zits...Steps to stop the eruptions<br>  <br>  Here are some tips on reducing and preventing zits. But remember, even if you practice good hygiene and have healthy eating habits, chances are you'll break out at some point. It's normal.<br>  <br>  1. Wash<br>  <br>  Wash your skin morning and night with a gentle cleanser that cleans your pores without drying your skin (don't use grainy, harsh scrubs since these can actually cause acne). i recommend you use neutragena pink grape fruit oil free acne wash.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. T-zone<br>  <br>  Some areas of your face, like your forehead, nose, and chin (often called the T-zone because it's shaped like the letter T) might be oilier than the rest of your face. So treat it differently: wash it with a non-oily cleanser.<br>  3. Water<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of water. It helps flush away impurities.<br>  4. Foods<br>  <br>  Although foods cannot cause zits, some people find that what they eat affects their skin. So say hello to healthy food, like fresh fruit and veggie snacks and see-you-later to chocolate and greasy foods like french fries and buttered popcorn. If you think you get zits after eating certain foods, keep a list and avoid eating too much of them or eating them at all.<br>  5. Relax!<br>  Anxiety and stress can cause the adrenal glands to make more hormones, which can cause zits to suddenly pop up. You have a lot going on in your life, but try to take time out for a walk or yoga or whatever works for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ********* PRODUCT FOR ACNE GOING AWAY FAST***********<br>  also i recommend you buy a bottle of tea tree oil [it works trust me there was a big improvement in my acne the the first time i used it. you can buy it at CVS or Wal Mart or Walgreens. you put it on a cotton ball or cotton pad and put a thin layer of it on your face. (you may feel a tingling sensation on your face for up to a minute or half a minute [first couple times] ) and it's cheaper than spending $30.00 plus shipping and handling on proactive<br>  TRUST ME IT WORKS!!!<br>  Good Luck I Hoped This Helped!!!!!!!|`|RMppfinbaa	Do not, I repeat DO NOT! use Saint Ives Apricot Scrub. You'll be able to use that when your 50, not 13. The beads scratch your skin and is so ruff for your skin. Dove soap is meant for your body, not your face. If your acne is not bad, you can try an over the counter product like La Roche Poser or something. A soft face wash that contains salicylic acid should do the trick. Use a gel not cream moisturizer is your skin is oily or sensitive. If those products doesn't work, try Proactiv. It works well for minor acne, I wouldn't say extreme. It can be very harmful though (it dries skin) therefor, go see your dermatologist. It has a good reputation for doing the trick though. They have a new Green Tea moisturizer on the market that is awesome for sensitive skin and moisturizes well if their product has dried your skin. <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|JYHlPczxaa	First, I understand where you're coming from. I grew up with really bad acne, not only on my face but on my body as well. It was embarrassing and I tried everything including cleansers, creams, prescription medications, antibiotics, over the counter medications, and even shots from the dermatologist (ouch!) to get rid of it. I never did until many years later when it didn't matter as much.<br>  <br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  It's not a topical issue, it doesn't help much to treat it from the outside, it's an inside job. When you treat it from the outside it's like treating the symptoms, not the cause. You'll hear from many people that's not the case, and it's usually because they want you to buy their creams or lotions, and keep buying them month after month after month (or they haven't experienced the truth). Of course, when you stop using it (as you've experienced) your blemishes come back... because you're not treating the cause. And the costs for all of these routines/drugs add up month after month.<br>  <br>  If you think about it logically, it makes sense. Why do we get rashes, breakouts, or other skin irritations? It's usually because of something we ate, something that wasn't meant to be put on our skin, something that caused us stress and our body reacts to all those things. <br>  <br>  Bottom line is that most every cause of acne is related to what you eat, how you feel and how you take care of yourself. Your skin is a reflection of what's on the inside. We have lots of toxins building up in our systems and they have to be cleaned out on the inside and that will reflect on the outside. The blemishes, rashes, acne, etc are indications that your body is reacting to what you're eating, to stress, toxins, chemicals, hormones... literally a great number of things.<br>  <br>  Basically what I did in a nutshell was clean out my system by taking out the processed and junk foods, and added as much fresh fruits and vegetables to my diet as possible. This part is key. I also started drinking a lot of water daily, starting with 3 or 4 glasses when I wake up (adding a squeeze of fresh lemon at times). I also got more active every day, walking, running, sports, jumping, whatever, just getting active. It not only gave me more energy, it help flush out the toxins that were clogging up my system.<br>  <br>  I followed the regimen in these two books I found:<br>  <a href="http://theacnefreein3days.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theacnefreein3days.blogspot.com/</a><br>  and<br>  <a href="http://theacnenomore.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theacnenomore.blogspot.com/</a>|`|AQdxHn6maa	1.) Find out what type of skin you have, normal to dry, oil, combination, sensitive etc.<br>  a.) Find a gentle and affect acne cleanser (ask the sales associates, which is the best for you)<br>  b.) Get a toner that also suits your skin use it everyday<br>  c.) moisturizer too!<br>  <br>  ***Wash your face every morning and night and use the toner and don't be afraid to ask your doctor for a prescription medication gel or cream to put on your acne to clear it up.|`|iLAABPGDaa	Go to the store and buy 3 things. (none are expensive.)<br>  1. Dove soap : this is a mild soap that cleans your face without a scummy residue. Use everyday.<br>  2. St. Ives Apricot Scrub: Or any scrub, I just named a popular one. Using this every other day will exfoilate off dead skin, preventing breakouts.<br>  3. Clearasil Ultra Vanishing Cream: This product has 10% benzoil peroxide in it, and benzoil peroxide is extremely effective at clearing up acne, because it focuses on the bacteria. Put a layer of this on your face before you sleep at night.<br>  <br>  I too get mild acne and now I don't thanks to these products. I hope you have the same luck I did with them:)|`|WGka5swJaa	well first of all never pick them cause when i was ur age i used to pick them and now i have scars because of that.  but for the pimples try pads like stridex or masks like oatmeal(mix oatmeal and water make sure it's not runny) put it all over your face for about 15min. ur face should start to look better
srDGX5Mbaa	if u use garnier fructis color stay stuff it helps it stay way longer =)
DkT8znckaa	It will grow at the same rate. Permed/relaxed hair breaks easily, so it often doesn't grow very long if you don't take good care of it. You said you get braids a lot......here is no need for a perm if you just put your hair in braids, but keep in mind it'll take a few months to grow your hair to the point where it'll be long enough to add extensions to. When you go to get your relaxer done, does your hair dresser tell you you have "A lot of new growth" ? If she does, your hair will probably grow back in fine. How long is your hair now? Personally, I would never cut off all my relaxed hair. It took me four years to get it from my chin to my shoulders. I say mistake. You need to research ways to care for permed hair. Try a re-constructor (type of shampoo) and make sure you wrap and deep condition. Some people wear natural hair really well. But also personally, I'd never walk out of my house bald. Give it a shot, and if it looks bad you can always just braid it once it grows back long enough. When you keep natural hair in braids, it grows well because braids are a protective hairstyle. Relaxed hair sometimes breaks in braids, but you can grow your natural hair really long with them. I met a lady who grew her hair to her shoulders in four years like that.|`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	No, your hair will not grow faster, it will grow the same. The difference is because natural hair is curly you cannot look at it and tell how long it is because it will ALWAYS look shorter than it actually is. With natural hair you can have MUCH healthier hair compared to perms because perms contain harmful chemicals that completely damage your natural hair, which is why the permed hair does not revert. Natural is healthier, go for it. I cut off all my permed ends last summer and I've noticed thicker, stronger, and healthier hair. My hair no longer breaks off like it did with the perm, so I'm able to retain ALL of my growth. My hair has grown at least 3 inches in length, but had I still had my perm my  hair would have grown much less because of breakage. By "grown" I mean to get longer and not how fast it grows from the scalp. Being relaxed or natural does not dictate how fast your hair grows from the scalp, but it could make a difference on how much of your hair does not break off - that's the key to achieving longer hair.<br>  <br>  Whether or not its a huge mistake will depend on how you feel about your hair and being natural. Do a whole lot of research on this before you make a decision and weigh the pros and cons and go from there. Some people go natural to see their hair grow longer (because they lost a lot of hair because of breakage from the perm) and they'll perm it again once it reaches a certain length. SO, in essence, you could have longer hair in a shorter period of time compared to having a perm if the perm is breaking off your hair. This doesn't mean its growing faster, but that your retaining more length as a natural.

gXrwqoTGaa	Do not use a lighter foundation or powder. It will make you look like a ghost.|`|NAwzuLayaa	Do NOT use makeup to make your skin look lighter, stay out of the sun and wear a SPF 50+  sunblock daily. An all natural way to lighten your skin is using egg whites. Separate the yolks and the egg whites, beat the egg whites in a bowl until frothy - this will make them spread easier. Now, apply the egg whites onto your face or skin and let dry for 15 - 20 minutes, wash your face with warm water and soap and apply a light moisturizer. Good luck.|`|1gjk5DhZaa	stay indoors,<br>  DO NOT USE A LIGHTER POWDER<br>  it'll look bad|`|sOkTUYq7aa	light ppowder foundation|`|AA11538827	highlight the cheekbones, nose, chin and forehead with a lighter colored shimmer than your skin color.

fW029NAXaa	You should only get 10% of your support from your straps - if its not supporting you properly then you are probably wearing the wrong back size. The band under your bra should fit with JUST 2 flat fingers gap. This holds the bra in place and the straps give a further 10% support to keep the bra in position. It might feel tight to start with but you soon get used to it and its much better for your figure. <br>  <br>  Read these guides to measuring your bra size and making sure it fits perfectly:|`|NrXDYAPGaa	You could  cut them and re sew them, but they may fray.<br>  Some stores sell shorter bras straps, you could buy some of them.<br>  You could also tie them around your neck like a halter top.

Also, people may look at you differently because even though you weight 90 pounds..sometimes the fat calories store in different places...some people gain fat in their thighs, stomach, etc. Anyway, of all things...you should eat more...not lose weight. =] Love yourself.|`|6ae7HtCUaa	being asain isn't relevant to weight by the way. but hell no!!!!! i have a friend who's like ur height and about 20 pounds more than you, and she's not even fat! she's just curvy. you probably are just more developed than the people calling you fat. god, i envy my friends body. im like ur weight and about 9" taller than you, so obviously we're very different sizes, and i probably do envy ur body|`|iUGScxfdaa	yea, exercise man, i got to too, but 90 pounds is alot , im 160 and 16 years old, middle eastern, my skinny brother is 12 and he's 65 pounds.|`|uyXfPDzDaa	No, 90 pounds is very slim<br>  your still growing too<br>  so even if you feel fat, when you grow taller you will slim out<br>  so your fine|`|xC9SIZbGaa	Kids are cruel, don't listen to them - take a long hard look in the mirror and ask yourself the question.

3e5cOV0Jaa	It actually is better to make your own. Its alot safer and looks alot better (like the salons do it.) All you have to do is poop in a bowl and mash some berries into the feces, than you you spit in the mixture. after you stir it about 55 times (no more than 55) rub in your hair naked. Than you have to go outside and let it dry. It works for me.|`|wVJ4PJJXaa	Don't try to go too dark, if you miss spots you will definitely notice them.  I would go maybe a shade or two darker than your natural color. Defnitely look at the samples on the side of the box that say If you hair is THIS color, it will come out THIS color...find one as close to your natural color and go from there. <br>  <br>  For anything darker than one or two shades I would go to a salon to ensure even coverage.  <br>  <br>  I have thick curly hair and I usually use two boxes (better to have too much than not enough).  <br>  <br>  I have used Loreal's Feria, not only because it works great but also b/c their boxes have more dye in them than the others (I have been known to use up to 3 boxes of the other brands). <br>  <br>  Another suggestion would be to try a semi-permanant color first in the shade you are leaning towards. These will cause no severe damage, and will give you an idea.  Cause once you use permanant is a pain to get out. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

IIpEaDCcaa	On the Tyra Banks show, a skin consultant said that you should start anti-aging at birth.<br>  <br>  She was saying that skin aging is always starting or happening.<br>  <br>  I started using anti aging creams at age 8... I just used a normal lotion on my face that prevented sun damage. (Which - sun damage later makes you age)<br>  <br>  So it depends on the person.|`|GwEEEyNRaa	You are "old" enough now to begin seriously taking care of your skin.  After washing/showering in the morning, apply a good moisturizer to your face using light strokes.  Use face make-up very lightly - nothing too heavy.  ALWAYS remove your make-up completely before going to bed, and ALWAYS follow that with more moisturizer.  In the summer, ALWAYS apply sunscreen all over.  After swimming, shower & apply more moisturizer.  Any good cream moisturizer is OK; I've used the L'Oreal line for years.  For the rest of your body, Vaseline puts out good cream products.|`|wyUhx5b6aa	Well, I'm going to assume that you have sensitive skin.  You should wash your face regularly with a gel oil free facial wash. If you have acne I personally like products with Salicylic acid. I then use tea tree oil to spot treat pimples then use 100% aloe Vera gel(no fragrance or color) put all over face when you go to bed; it will dry and feel tight your face will be so soft in the morning!  You should also start using moisturizer w/ SPF protection now too. Try to stay out of direct sun whenever possible. When you get to be my age (37) you will wish you did. I am now starting to see sun spots but for the most part my skin is nice and I still look young....everyone thinks that I'm 20,lol<br>  <br>  FYI...I now use full strength tea tree oil but I started by diluting with water. (wet cotton square with water then add a drop of 100% tea tree oil)|`|3bTFgHBXaa	well you should start using the heavy duty anti wrinkle creams in ur early 40s but as of right now you should use sunscreen everyday and yes you should use some anti aging things right now just use them in moderation

Also, toothpaste dries out pimples and acne marks, so you could try that. It's cheap and affordable. Spot Remover from Origins works really well, and it's only $10.00. The cleansing strips from Biore' work awesome too. Just use them every three days. Lastly, try washing your face day and night with Clean and Clear face wash. It's worked for me so it'll work for you. :)|`|yNYUuT23aa	foundation
qQXoKjYvaa	As for pain, it really doesn't hurt. I was freaking out about the pain just before i got mine done. So i was like testing the waters by pinching where i'd get pierced with my nails. I'm kinda glad i did, cuz actually getting it pierced hurts less than pinching it! haha. anyways, the clamp thing they use pretty much numbs your navel so you hardly feel the need go through. i'm warning you, the needle is a lot thicker than say an earring. i think it's usually 14g. so basically it doesn't hurt, it just feels a little weird because of the piece of skin, and how thick the piece of skin they're piercing is.<br>  <br>  as for colored barbells, i would advise against getting a barbell as a first ring for your navel. why? because barbells don't move or rotate, which means the same metal will be touching the wound the whole healing process, so it will collect more bacteria leading to a potential infection. captive rings are a better choice, because they do rotate and they're easier to clean- although they don't look as good. But if you're still set on a barbell, they probably have colored ones- you can ask. but it will definitely cost more.<br>  <br>  when i got mine done, my two bestfriends got theirs done two. and that made it a lot better. if you can find a friend who can/is willing to get theirs done to, at least bring one for moral support. i held my friends hand. also, just relax. don't think about it or else it'll hurt. don't worry about anything, i promise it will be worth it. after i got mine done, i like could not stop smiling! haha. <br>  <br>  ps, make sure you clean it really good, and don't try to change it before the recommended healing time is up. <br>  also, don't go around showing everyone like the mistake me and my friends made. we got called sluts, and even our teachers found out about it, and then it became embarrassing. so keep it between your friends and family. its none of anyone other then who you want it to be's business. okay? good luck! i hope you like it (:|`|poBLjveNaa	umm, I went with my friend.<br>  she seemed totally fine, I just stood next to her and smiled at her while she was getting it done, and let her hold my hand:D<br>  just don't like, freak out.<br>  it will definately be worth it(:<br>  I actually think you can get a different colored barbell, I think they just might cost more.<br>  I'm not positive though, it could differ per place.<br>  maybe for your first one it has to be silver. <br>  good luck! it'll be fine, I promise.<br>  my friend said it was just like a pinch, and not that bad.<br>  :D|`|30115ffe6a4ae9195c2e11d0888849e8aa	ya dont NEED one!|`|q09xI2zKaa	well when i got my belly button pierced, i had someone like talk to me while i was getting it done, telling me to close my eyes and that it was almost over. and in no time, it was done. it was only a pinch to me. and i got my belly button pierced with a silver bar with baby blue rhinestones.<br>  so i suggest to close your eyes and not look at it, and if you want, you can hold someones hand, thats what i did.

It works perfectly.

Txm6l89haa	Well if your a prep those are probably the type of clothes you'll wear, but just because you where them it doesn't necessarily make you a prep. It also depends a lot on your personality and how you act. For example, my friend shops at A&F, but nobody in their right mind would EVER mistake her as a prep cause she's all death metal and stuff, which sounds like an oxymoron but i guess she's a rare case. So the answer is no, it doesn't make you a prep.|`|RvVvaVsAaa	youre stupid. why do you HAVE to have a label. people wear what they wear and are what they are. get over the stereotyping. im guessing your still in middle/high school... typical..|`|jKA8SovQaa	well, I GEUSS. everyone's basically a prep now , because theirs really no "cool" stores in mall's anymore, no one wants to be emo or scene cause its "old" and girls need to spend thousands to fit in and the only stores that have nice clothes are the preppy ones, hey at least your not trying to fit in! . just say i got my own style, i like my style in clothes but i dont act like a prep. and you could start shopping at pacsun,dehila's,forever 21, and too cute, switch it around.|`|mBVXgRLFaa	no. you're just you. i wear those clothes too because i happen to like them. if people judge you by the clothes you wear then thats pathetic. people should just wear what they like.|`|jGqZdS2xaa	Same here, but just because you wear preppy clothes doesnt mean your a prep. A prep is someone who acts preppy. Its not just based on how you dress.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps! <3|`|teNUDFtGaa	NO. <br>  <br>  i wear hollister and abercrombie too <3|`|V5K66Xb4aa	no, wearing those clothes and being a jerk to anyone who doesnt makes you a prep|`|7q5HsXALaa	That's not being prep it's called having style and knowing what is "in". I wear Hollister and Abercrombie & Fitch and im a dude. Why do I wear these clothes, cause they are comfortable and i like the muscle fit AND it is in/stylish. So screw whoever called u prep, they are just jealous (especially if it was a emo person or something)|`|fxgMwo7iaa	Wearing something doesn't make you anything. You're stupid.|`|2bpMVJ6Caa	No. I don't think it is just the brand names. Don't listen to others.|`|xGbYdcMGaa	Prep means your girly and all the sh*t. And say omg! a lot. Every1 one at my skool wears thos even the dudes.|`|iLAABPGDaa	No. I dislike stereotypes as well.|`|aQ2IoZzkaa	who pays 20 bucks for a shirt??|`|MaPPHhbqaa	tell them that you got them at the goodwill store|`|z0tPsXN8aa	No it doesn't make you one "preps" as we label them do wear brand name clothes when the label them and just your clothes is not how and why people label other people it may make you more considered for that clique when being "placed" but it has no big part|`|BB6TnaAxaa	Abercrombie and american eagle are a little preppy but not really<br>  hollister isn prep, just casual clothes. just popular guys shop at those places<br>  ralph lauren, lacoste are prep|`|vV9qPn16aa	no its how you carry yourself and how you piece the outfit.well do u want to look prep>?|`|cXuL87bKaa	those brands aren't preppy so know. But if you act like a stuck up bit*h then naybe|`|Z4wmiI37aa	It matters if you act like one. but, those brands are preppy.....
TmEoTapDaa	Hair is gross. I don't like to sleep on a pile of hair when we snuggle up.

My guy doesn't have chest or facial hair, which is a major plus.

For me its more manly then having a hairless body
16o6qrtdaa	it all depends on the Plato's you go to. Each one depends on the things people bring in. The Plato's near me has Uggs and they are usually only around 20$ which is great! So I would go check it out and see and you never know; you might find other things you llike there.<br>  <br>  and no sorry i dont know where the closest one is in chicago. i do love chicago though! i wanna move there so bad! i just LOVE it there :)|`|uRHVCvNPaa	yeah, when they get them they are gone that day. so you have to try every day and maybe you will get lucky.|`|0pJAXEXCaa	Many of the girls in my grade wear Uggs, but I haven't seen any at our Plato's.  You will probably be very lucky to find them there.  Still, search around all the local thrift shops just to check!  My guess is they could be around $20.
bKBnHqkMaa	no lol same withme i live with it its normal|`|bcRS7A3saa	no.<br>  <br>  you're normal.<br>  <br>  :]|`|aKvxy3xBaa	You need a good moisturizing hand lotion, Try Euercin.|`|fyKydb6Iaa	may be dehydrated,  and I guess you don't pay for the hot water, if you stay in the shower that long.|`|rdp95817aa	you need to change lotion or your soap and apply a different lotion|`|0gCEVaEfaa	noo.... well it is winter to so your hand mite be rly dry... put some lotion on dem n see if dat helps|`|2ohesE19aa	Nope. its normal. your hands are just soaking up the water.
AA11927302	go to debs fersherrr and black would look nice! :)|`|M1vcUoo5aa	blue or green or pink (:<br>  forever 21 !!!!|`|EUCa7Hc5aa	Try a deep blue colour. Definatelly something that accentuates your best features and covers up any flaws. Don't do anything too flashy though...when grade eights in my school wear things that are too flashly..they look tacky. Try maybe a light summer dress!|`|zgDxpqRsaa	try going 2 DEBS or 2 Koohls and omg im grad. from the 8th grade 2!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  and if you have rossy checks hot pink would b3 great <br>  <br>  <br>  (ihave rossy checks 2)|`|tecsaGeaaa	Get one that compliments your features, maybe a blue dress?

mhyL7Qw3aa	Well for foundation you should buy Rimmel London's Stay Matte foundation. It's light weight, covers well, and absorbs excess oil on your face so you don't have to touch up your makeup. If you want a bit more coverage, you can buy a concealer. New York Color's Cover Stick concealer is perfect because its creamy and covers well. For a blush you should buy New York Color's Cheek Glow Powder Blush, they have this in many colors so you can find something that works with your skin color. The blush also absorbs excess oil on your face. For eyeshadow you should buy a quad that has shadows that you can use everyday. Maybelline has quads in many colors but you should start out with neutral colors. There are so many kinds of eyeliners out there but my favorite kind is a kohl liner. They are extremely cream and they stay on for a long time. I like Jordana's Kohl liner in onyx and you can buy it at Walgreens.  A volumizing mascara is the best way to go, I really like L'Oreal's Voluminous Mascara. For lip gloss you should buy a color that can be worn with everything. Clear lip gloss is good for this but you can also buy a pink lip gloss. For skin care, you want things that will help your skin since you have acne prone skin. A foaming facial wash will wash away any dirt and makeup that you have on your face and it will treat your acne. I also like Stridex pads because they give you much more treatment and clear up any blemishes you have on your face. The pads are to be used after your cleanser. For your moisturizer, you need something that is lightweight. Last, you need a sunscreen to keep your skin safe from the sun.<br>  <br>  The Rimmel foundation is $7<br>  Concealer is $2<br>  Eyeshadow is $3<br>  Liner $2<br>  Mascara $8<br>  Foaming cleanser $5<br>  Stridex pads $5|`|D4NOrqM7aa	skin:<br>  clean and clear morning glow moisturizer<br>  clean and clear advantage spot treatment<br>  neutrogena transparent facial bar<br>  <br>  makeup:<br>  maybelline dream matte mousse<br>  neutrogena lip gloss<br>  covergirl lashblast (WATERPROOF)<br>  physician's formula concealor<br>  maybelline define a line eyeliner<br>  covergirl pressed powder (pretty blue compact)<br>  <br>  good luckerzz=]|`|r4i7xPnMaa	You should concentrate on getting your acne under control before you proceed to makeup.<br>  <br>  I suggest:<br>  (3)A good facewash, toner, and moisturizer for people with acne. The Clean n' Clear system works pretty well, I understand. I tried the Neutrogena system and it was alright.<br>  (1)A good exfoliator.<br>  (2)Almay Clear Complexion foundation and powder<br>  (1)Mascara (brown-black if you're pale and have blonde, light brown, or red hair. Black if you're not so pale, or have black hair. Or clear if you're unsure, or have super awesome lashes to begin with.)<br>  (1)A nice, neutral lipcolor, or a lip balm with a hint of color. Burt's Bees has some great tinted lip balms, and you can never go wrong with a clear gloss.<br>  (1)If you can find it, Queen Helene's Mint Julep Masque. I've heard GREAT things about it, and it's supposed to really help your skin. I think it goes for about 4 bucks?<br>  (1)A pack of gum.

wVJ4PJJXaa	I have learned after many years that you can wear your curly hair pretty much any way you want...its all about the amount of patience and time you have for maintenance.  <br>  <br>  If you wanted to go w/ a short shaggy 'do blow drying it alone isn't going to keep it from frizzing up.  You will have to use a flat iron as well. That's the only way you will see the definition of the cut (which is the whole point of a shag). Flat ironing should make the style last a few days tops. <br>  <br>  However, if you know that you don't have the patience for the flat ironing then maybe you should consider growing out longer layers. The weight of the hair keeps unruly curls in check!
n8VlnckAaa	Most of us at some point will have to deal with dark circles under our eyes. Whether it be due to stress, lack of sleep, a hang-over, or just from ageing. The good news is that there are a lot of simple at-home ways to treat them. There is no need for surgery or laser treatments, all you really need is a trip to the grocery store and a couple of minutes to relax.<br>  <br>  Reasons for Under-eye Circles<br>  <br>  There are several causes for the formation of dark circles under the eyes. The most common reason is due to genetics. Dark circles under the eyes are practically unavoidable if they run in your family, but that isn't to say that there aren't treatments out there for them (see below). But for those whose genetic background doesn't predispose them to dark circles the reasons can be numerous- dehydration, stress, lack of sleep, diet, or any combination.<br>  <br>  Prevention of Under-eye Circles<br>  <br>  It is said that the best medicine is always prevention. There are several ways to fully prevent or reduce the appearance of under-eye circles (even if you are genetically predisposed). Since dark circles can be caused by dehydration be sure to drink enough water (eight 8-oz glasses per day) and avoid things that cause dehydration, including alcohol, caffeine, and sugar. Diet and exercise can also lead to dark circles; these dark circles are actually an indication that you are not getting proper nutrients. Evaluating your diet to be sure you are getting enough to fill your daily needs is important. Stress and lack of sleep also lead to dark under-eye circles; if this is the case it is recommended getting an additional hour of sleep a night. All of this prevention is a lot easier said than done, most of us don't have time for extra 5 minutes of sleep, let alone an extra hour, and I highly doubt most of us can give up our morning coffee, fortunately there are quite a few at natural home remedies to combat dark under-eye circles (see below).<br>  <br>  Natural Remedies<br>  <br>  There are three keys to these home remedies: moisturizing the skin, cooling the skin, and stimulating the skin. Moisturizing helps eliminate dark circles by dehydrating the skin, cooling the skin helps by relieving the stress around the eyes, and stimulating the skin brings blood flow into the area causing it to look more alive. The following are a couple home remedies which complete one or a combination of these treatments. Remember that each person and skin type is different, so if one doesn't work for you, try another.<br>  <br>      * Cut an unwaxed cucumber into slices, cool in refrigerator and place on eyes for 10 minutes.<br>      * Massage with almond oil under and around eyes.<br>      * Massage with peanut oil under and around eyes.<br>      * Place two tea bags (preferably chamomile tea) in cold water for 5 minutes, than place on eyes for 10 minutes.<br>      * Apply a paste of turmeric powder with pineapple juice, rinse after 5 minutes (be sure not to get into eyes).<br>      * Grate an unwaxed cucumber or a small scrubbed (preferably red) potato. Put the gratings on two gauze pads, than place on eyes for 10 minutes.<br>      * Apply a mixture of lemon juice and tomato juice, let sit for 5 minutes, than rinse (be sure not to get into eyes).<br>      * Apply crushed mint leaves under the eyes for 20 minutes.<br>      * Dip cotton balls in rose water and apply to under eye for 10 minutes.<br>      * Eat foods rich in vitamin E, vitamin C, and iron.|`|IQ0MjIqDaa	I have thin skin and suffer from the same thing. I first use a moisturizer (after the early-morning cucumber and ice facial), then use a shade lighter than my base around the circles and in the corners of my eyes. Make sure you powder them, also. I've found using a bit of "neutral" eye shadow on the lids helps, also. <br>  <br>  You might want to consider "lifting" your eyes to draw attention away from the dark circles. Use an eyeliner and mascara ONLY on the top lid, Use a dark, charcoal color at the outer corner of your eyelids for interest, and then, comb your eyebrows up (I use hairspray on a toothbrush to groom my eyebrows). I've always had dark circles and these tricks help me draw attention away from them. Sometimes, a good night's sleep just doesn't get it.|`|nwjiJbs2aa	I highly recommend LaRocca or Murad. I've tried out a plethora of products for this problem and those are the only brands I've come across so far that actually work!|`|jSjV8f95aa	There are some excellent concealers on the market that can decrease the appearance of those annoying circles. Choose a yellow concealer since this tends to offset the underlying darkness of the circle. Follow this with application of a concealer several shades lighter than your natural skin tone. Use a powder that blends with your natural skin tone to cover.
cmK9Go1gaa	I have the EXACT same problem!! I got my bangs done, also if you really want to straighten it, try a straightener with a higher temperature, you can also use Pantene's new straigtening shampoo and conditioner, And Conair has an ion charged blow dryer that really works! Also, if you want you could try layers, a short look, a choppy look, or even a boy cut (alst one not necessarily recommmended:) )
yQI7lnpGaa	BIG HAIR!!|`|0M6DSPQPaa	When you're done styling your hair, flip your head over and spritz with Bed Head Masterpiece hairspray.  It will have CRAZY volume when you bring your head up.  Just lightly comb it down until it looks how you want.  One of the best ways to get volume is to lightly tease the hair at the crown.  This take some practice to get right, but don't be discouraged.  It works really good for volume and all you need is a comb or pick.<br>  <br>  You could also try using a volumizing mousse before blow drying your hair.  I use Nexxus.|`|sDHcgRCGaa	VO5 its a mose
0pJAXEXCaa	Of course you can!  To keep them from being too wispy, though, you may have to adjust your hairline a bit so that hair a little further back or from the other side gets brushed to the front and into your bangs. (Sorry if that makes no sense...hmm....like Mason from Metro Station MAJORLY does that.)<br>  <br>  Getting layers that are cut just right should give your hair a little lift, and tease and use hairspray.  Finally, don't put conditioner on your roots, ever.  And, when you get out of the shower, pat your hair so it's damp but not sopping, tease your hair with a comb, and blow dry upside down.  This should also help to pump up the volume.|`|rENVXGd3aa	yeah ! it totally should, i have thin "scene" hair too !<br>  just get lots of layers that are really short on the top, and tease it and use a lot of hairspray. <br>  hope i helped !<br>  XD|`|SPBrhbHkaa	if you i have a long face u wud probab look best w short hair and the bangs would work|`|eMf70A1Raa	yeh! it shud definatly work.<br>  scene hair is almost always really thick or really thin.. and most scene girls need to thin out there hair.. but u wont need to cus its alrady thin.. lucky huh!|`|JDogbPg6aa	poser noob

I actually own that bag and it is absolutely a beautiful bag for that price and for an ALL LEATHER bag!  You can remove the jingle jangle thing easily (that's what I did).  I love that you have 2 bags in 1 (a shoulder and a satchel).  Very roomy, a classic style bag and you can carry this now, to the office, a professional interview or meeting and just look chic and put together).  Plus, it comes with a nice pink JC dust bag.   <br>  <br>  I have seen bag #2 at Nordies and for a Marc by Marc Jacobs bag it looks hideous.  I am having trouble believing the material is made of leather because it looks like a cheap piece of PVC.  I have seen the Kate Spade bag in her store in Georgetown, Washington DC and it is okay, but just a bit "blah". Plus, the bag is made mostly of fabric and I cannot justify their price tag when there is very little leather on the bag.

Silver and gray is always good too. Any color is fine. and then skip the liquid eyeliner and put on the mascara, it will look softer. Also wear pink lipgloss or lipstick or sometimes even red lipgloss, it'll make a big difference.

Get bangs and wear conservative clothing.|`|czAbrzcUaa	Sorry but I just think you look a bit cheap and not in an attractive way.<br>  You'd be really pretty if you looked more natural - less eyeshadow, more clothes and not over-straightened hair.|`|69GgJhnWaa	Ok first, they have these things called camisoles. Get one. And wear it. Second, your eye shadow is way too dark. Dark, smokey eye shadow is fine for going out to a club or something, but not everyday wear. I would hop onto youtube and cruise allthaglitters21 or panacea's sites. They have tons of really great eye make-up tutorials that are really pretty, classy and great for an evening out or everyday wear.|`|9dd18f9e6c34eb25a0a374720657f305aa	to much eye makeup.

bhnPUzypaa	Prove to her you can put make-up on without over doing it. My mum did that when i was younger, and it was basically because i was tangoed with panda eyes, so just put i little bit on and maybe she will widen your variety of makeup. You just need to prove to her.|`|FklngtvCaa	Try tightlining, it's pretty discreet but you still use eyeliner.<br>  <a href="http://raquel13.com/makeup/tutorials/" rel="nofollow">http://raquel13.com/makeup/tutorials/</a>|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Why arent you allowed to use makeup?

9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	Browns (mid to dark) suit you the best due to your skin tone. The dark colours accentuate your features.

And aslo, I saw your blog picture--which is another photo of a different person.. aaand on your Yahoo! 360 profile--you have even more photos of, once again, a different girl.  WTF?!  You could've at least stole pictures of the same person to use for this pointless BS.  Haha.  People these days.  Really?  I need to start a question to find out why people do crazy crap like this.

xBgKqAPHaa	I use a product called Maximum Teeth Whitening . You order it over the internet. For like $30 AUD you get 2 syringes of the whitening gell, instruction booklet and a moulding thing for your teeth and instructions on how to do it. Its easy, pretty quick and great value for money compared to some of the things around. I did heeps of looking around the internet before i ordered.<br>  <br>  It has worked great for me, i put it in my mouth now and then just to keep my smile white. I liked it so much that i have re-ordered it since finishing my last lot!<br>  I get lots of compliments on my white teeth and this is the baby to thank!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maximumteethwhitening.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.maximumteethwhitening.com/</a>|`|RC2aQBkgaa	Just brush your teeth after every meal and rinse with a whitening mouth wash. Floss and really try hard. Take a few minutes and just brush thoroughly! That's the all time best way to get your teeth clean. I do nothing but that and I have never even had a cavity before in my life and I'm 15 turning 16.|`|f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	The most common option used as homemade teeth whitening agent is baking soda, which has a mild bleaching action. Given that it is used in baking, it also implies safety. Baking soda is sprinkled on the toothbrush, and teeth then cleaned using a gentle, circular motion. Care should still be taken though, especially for people with gum sensitivity. Old wives’ recipes often state that a paste of baking powder, a little salt, and a few drops of white vinegar, works effectively.<br>  <br>  Salt, used exactly as baking soda, is also touted as being a good teeth whitener. However, it might just be its osmosis, dehydrating action that makes teeth appear whiter, since dehydrated teeth look whiter. <br>  <br>  Lemon juice is often used, but it had high acidic levels, so teeth can weaken in the long run. Other natural, fruit options regard rubbing the inside of an orange peel on the teeth. A strawberry cut in half and the inside rubbed on teeth also works. Mashed strawberry can also be applied with a toothbrush. Apple cider vinegar is also said to be effective. Dried orange rind, and walnut bark, is also good.<br>  <br>  For other effective home teeth whitening solutions, you may wish to read about them here :  <a href="http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house....</a>|`|l3Fx04Ghaa	brush you teeth atleast 2ice a day.<br>  use mouthwash and flossers too. use whiting all of those.<br>  <br>  a neat way to whiten teeth is crush up strawberrys...<br>  put them in your mouth around your teeth and just keep them in there for as long as you can stand them... then do it again. and agian.<br>  <br>  strawberrys have a natrual bleach in them causing a whitening effect!:)<br>  hope i helped!|`|XYEdP822aa	It use listerine pre brush whitening mouth wash and then I just used a toothpaste that whitens and my teeth within a week look whiter.|`|29EORG8Iaa	Lemon juice. I know it's gross but it works. I did it in the summer.|`|uZe8eBDyaa	honestly i know you want a home remedy. and lemon juice and strawberry juice will work..but it wont even be a noticeable difference what so ever. I would recommond white strips (crest) if your teeth arent that bad you dont even need to use them 2 weeks. just a few days and it will make a huge change. They have listerine white strips that dissolve on ur teeth in 10 minutes and kill bad breath germs at the same time.They are only $15 dollars at walmart. They are very very gentle on your teeth and work soo well. White teeth are noticeable and can really change a person. You will smile more when ppl notice how nice and clean and white your teeth are. GOODLUCKK!!!!|`|sMAVG9IJaa	Sprinkle your toothbrush with baking soda then scrub your teeth with that for as long as it takes to reach each individual tooth.<br>  WARNING ; it tastes like salt. ew.<br>  <br>  Then, swish are some hydrogen peroxide in your mouth.<br>  Keep it there for at least 10 minutes<br>  WARNING ; do not swallow<br>  <br>  Then spit it out, and brush your teeth with toothpaste.<br>  Your teeth should be whiter and if you have a canker sore it shouldn't hurt anymore.<br>  <br>  Also, I heard this weakens your teeth so use this method limited.|`|BmmkY73Qaa	a strawberry paste will whiten your teeth but be careful because too much of the acid on strawberries are bad for your teeth|`|nwjiJbs2aa	Eat Apples and use Rembrandt toothpaste.|`|4xMg5dYCaa	bleach

IaTzGvF5aa	It depends on the grandparents.  Blue eyes are a recessive trait meaning that it appears less often than the others.  If the parents are both the parents are homozygous (rr) then the child have blue eyes.|`|QVrEEmFHaa	Blue, because it's recessive and if they both have the trait then their child will too.|`|ojwRgCLqaa	most likely blue but not nessisarly. it depends on parents genes. on what color eyes the parents and grandparents have.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	there is a high change the baby will have blue eyes but then again they may not<br>  <br>  in my family my mum/dad/older bro/sis and me all have brown eyes<br>  my little brother has blue<br>  <br>  so uknw anything can happen with genes|`|AA10771601	Maybe blue, maybe brown, depends on the recessive trait gene.|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	most likely blue.|`|azNO6v4Yaa	blue? or green cause blue is the rarest colour to have in eyes|`|7Wg8QdKeaa	Only blue because in order for a person to get blue eyes, both their dominant and their recessive traits are for blue eye color. So both the parents' recessive and dominant traits are blue, therefore the child can ONLY have blue eyes. Now if they have different degrees of blue or hazel, the range of colors the child can have are pretty great. But typically pure blue eyes + pure blue eyes = only pure blue eyes.|`|t1Lz8Ox1aa	it depends on the genes that are passed along...if one brown gene and one blue gene are passed, the childs eyes will be brown.  im sure theres like a website or something where you could look it up|`|mBVXgRLFaa	3/4 chance blue, depending on recessive traits.

vCSQnIlRaa	Very doubtful. Before I was 18 I had over 20 piercings and 6 tattoos that my parents signed for. Nothing ever happened to them and I leave in an extremely conservative area.|`|6ts5esy8aa	i dont no about the places where your from but in miami they dont report you due to the fact that its a adult someone over the age of 18 signing the papers stating that give permission for you as a minor to get the tattoo|`|t4F59gf2aa	How naive you are-tattoo artists are there to make money not be moral compasses for teenagers-what do they care.<br>  If booze was legal for six year olds you can bet bars would be catering to them.|`|EUyXOwuZaa	Parents get their babies ears pierced, and nobody reports them. I don't see the difference if its a small tattoo.|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	THat is absolute bullshit.  Think about it.   Who would report the parents to CPS?  The tattoo artist?  Why would he do that, its bad for business and plus if the parents really were drunk 1. how did they transport their kids there and 2.  if the artist allowed drunk parents to let their kid get a tattoo then they are partially responsible.  <br>  <br>  Even if it really happened, parlors would make it an absolute 18 and over policy on tattoos. <br>  <br>  You want it a quarter of the size, but thats about 1 inch by 1 inch as it is.  your new tat would be 1/4 by 1/4 of an inch which to me seems kinda small.|`|ZkrGttKaaa	In many places around the world, tattoos are considered  to be a rite of passage, and begin at puberty.

I don't know any that will.|`|27hANXS4aa	Well that link doesn't work for me, but no they don't report parents. I got two of my tattoo's when i was 17 (different times). At the same place, and it was a respectable place.|`|AA11930952	NO , not that i have ever heard of..and i have been in a lot of them..|`|XiOIBwbPaa	no, they can't report you that's the whole point of parental consent.<br>  Parental consent is when your parent has to sign a waiver saying you are allowed to get it done...theres nothing they can do.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Your link doesn't work.<br>  <br>  The question doesn't make much sense. Do you live in an area where 16+ is legal with parental consent, and are you talking about those teenagers? If so, there would be no grounds for a report, as the parent would not be breaking the law.<br>  <br>  If you mean reporting a parent for bringing in an illegal underager - well I can't see many tattoo artists doing that if they tattooed the child, because they have also broken the law. If the tattoo artist refused to tattoo the illegal underager that the parent brought in, then perhaps there may be cases where they've reported the parent. If so - good on 'em I say. A parent who takes an underager to get a tattoo is not intelligent - sober or otherwise. Something you'll realise when you're a parent yourself and have children of your own to watch out for. It's sad that some impressionable kids don't have their parents looking out for their best interests - so it's nice to think that someone else out there might be.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: in that case, if it's in a region where it's legal, then I don't imagine this is true. That would be a conflict of law. Very unlikely. And once again the tattoo artist would be just as guilty. Shame though - parents who let their children have tattoos under the age of 18 are absolute idiots. And that's coming from someone who is a parent, has a lot of tattoos, absolutely loves tattoos, but is responsible enough to realise that children under that age are too immature to make lifelong decisions. Yes, even a pawprint.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That is a typical view coming from a teenager. I have no doubt you are mature for your age. I was mature at your age too, and I know some other kids that are. I have a thirteen year old cousin who is incredibly mature for his age, very intelligent and can hold conversation very well with adults. But honey, you cannot cheat the clock. There are some things that the years give you that cannot be acquired as a teenager. It's called life experience. It has nothing to do with how good your grades are. All teenagers think they know what they'll want for life. And it's actually more dangerous in a teenager like you who is relatively mature for their years. They think that this means they have the same level of comprehension and decision making capabilities as an adult. But you don't. I know you won't believe this now. But try and remember this question. Print it out and stick it on your wall. I absolutely promise that in 5 or 6 years time you will know what I mean.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and I've just read your last paragraph. The fact that you admit you might need it removed is a glaring sign you are not mature enough for a tattoo. I don't mean to sound patronising but this is something for adults. If you're walking into it going 'I can get it removed if all else fails' then you ARE too immature. That is not the attitude to be taking with you to the tattoo studio. You only get a tattoo when you are CERTAIN you'll want it for the rest of your life until the day you die. You can't comprehend that now, right? Because you are too young. Laser removal is not perfect, it costs thousands even for a small tattoo, and I know people who have had up to a dozen sessions on a black tattoo, spend thousands, and have had no results. Black ink is not easy to remove and for some it simply doesn't work. I guess you've not done your research though, right? Oh and if you think normal foundation will cover a tattoo you have a nasty surprise in store for you. Only heavy duty specialist products come close to covering tattoos, and even they don't have perfect results, and are a very very pricey option if you intend to use it every day of your working life.<br>  <br>  And of course there are far worse things going in the world. That's an extremely naive thing to say. People are getting murdered every day, but that doesn't make it okay to go and beat someone up just because it's not as bad as murder, does it. Other things going on in the world have no relation to this issue. Something a mature person would realise.<br>  <br>  Sorry to tell you this honey but you are nowhere near as grown up as you think you are. I feel sorry for you. Your parents should be telling you this, not me.

AA11595834	Every guy has different tastes, but this is mine: Petite, I do not find height attractive at all...very small is feminine and attractive. Pretty features, but it has to convey a good soul...I can count on my hand the number of attractive girls I've seen in my life, and I've always known them- you simply CAN'T be pretty to me without it. I like any color eye, but dislike blonde hair. I don't go for large breasts, or too thin or too heavy- a healthy weight is good. It is nice when girls care about their physical appearance, but not in an obsessive way. I don't really like makeup very much, I mean maybe a little is ok, but...not too much. Nice skin is important. Pretty hands are nice too...hmmm...I could go on but this is sufficient.

0041d2c0255014fbc27c7596b9fc3f8caa	If I were you I would return them for either the smaller sized men's sandal or the correct sized women's sandal. If you're going to wear them with shorts or a skirt, I'd say better to get the women's sandal though. But! In my experience, I like the women's sandal to be a little bit bigger than my size is, that way I won't end up hang-gliding off the dam sandal and look like a fool walking down the street. Plus, the narrower fit of the women's sandal does compliment the bare foot and leg, especially when worn with shorts or a skirt. <br>  But take care not to get it TOO fitted, otherwise it might land you a blister. If you feel that the men's are a better fit as far as rubbing goes, I would definitely stick with the men's sandal but just return the one's you have now for a smaller size? Because it seems that the men's one that you have now may be a bit on the large side.<br>  Usually flip-flops are unisex unless they're just bright pink or something then obviously they're for females, or really daring males perhaps... or metrosexuals... <br>  Nevertheless, you could always go back to the store with the ones that you do own (and have the receipt for, I hope) and try out the other pairs in the store to see if you'd really like it to be a bit smaller or if the one you have already purchased is just an acquired taste. In which case you'd probably just need to wear em around the house a bit to work them in, and then they'll feel as great as any other sandals you already have had.<br>  <br>  Good luck whatever you decide to do though.<br>  <br>  Take it easy,<br>  miR :)|`|KjCDnkQ5aa	ohhk first of all rainbow flip flops are soo out of style<br>  <br>  <br>  return them and get diff ones|`|OOl3Nb2Qaa	I LOVE my rainbows, one of my firends wears only the mens and it doesnt look funny or anything, but its all up to you and how you feel wearing them, if they are big than go exchange them for sure, if they arnt comfortable and you dont like them but there isnt any problem with you wearing  mens...anything shoes shorts shirts whatever, you like is what you should wear|`|e2c9f42e67535de98fa0c0f4a9e3b71caa	I would get the womens|`|b4bf785cfafffb7e9c4089973be3f335aa	yes exchange..and let no one know you got the men's...wierd|`|aKHHh8nfaa	yeah, you should probably exchange them if they look weird.|`|AA10675436	You should definately exchange, you have a couple choices lol<br>  you can get a big size in the womens so it's not as narrow, you can get a smaller size in the mens so you can't really tell it's mens, or you can get used to the narrow feel of the womens?<br>  just some advice =D

ZbivePUfaa	I'm right there with ya, girl!  In high school I was overweight with braces, glasses, acne...the works.  Once I got into college, though, all of that changed--but that's been 5 years ago and I'm still not as confident as I know I should be.  First of all, being 5'7'' and 155 is NOT FAT.  That's quite normal in fact.  One thing I've learned is that you can't always go by the scale and what people say you "should" be in terms of weight.  People with more muscle, for example, or a bigger chest, will ultimately weigh a little heavier.  Besides, no one except for you knows what you weigh...and if people think you look 20 pounds lighter than you are, then take it as quite the compliment!  Try not to focus on the number so much as how you feel.  Do you like how you look in your new clothes?  Are you healthy?  If so, then focus on those things and not the numbers on a scale.<br>  <br>  I know it is hard to see yourself as attractive after all those years of feeling just the opposite, but try not to let that mindset take over.  It's just a matter of coming to accept yourelf and your newfound sexiness!  Best of luck to you!  I know it isn't easy, but you'll get there.  :-)|`|62N5DC8qaa	It don't matter what other people think about the way you look the inner beauty matter's more , look's will go with age but your inner beauty will alway's be there beside's some woman that i've known befor that thought they were all that, could be real beotches, don't pay any mind to those who knock you,we were all made in God's image .|`|9c0ebf2284780ff9c1a5dcae51b5d90eaa	Stop worrying about the weight.

5d4729e73a71441805dacb112f719926aa	What is eyebrow threading?|`|AA12083750	Your eyebrows make a big impact on your overall look. But keeping those eyebrows in perfect shape is not that easy, in fact it can be very painful to keep that perfect arch and shape.<br>  When it comes to keeping those eyebrows perfectly groomed there are few choices:<br>  <br>  1. You can try waxing. It is quick and effective. Sometimes, however, it is too effective and you can lose way too many hair, burn your eyebrows with hot wax and get stripped of the top layer of your skin.<br>  <br>  2. You can pluck your eyebrows. this can be very painful and makes you sneeze as the eyebrow roots are close to the nerve endings in your nose.<br>  <br>  3. Other alternative is INDIAN EYEBROW THREADING. Although you will have some eyewatering and sneezing but surprisingly eyebrow threading does not hurt as much as plucking and waxing.<br>  <br>  What is Indian eyebrow threading?<br>  <br>  Facial Threading and Eyebrow Threading is a proven age-old method of facial hair removal practiced in India, The procedure uses a 100% cotton thread which is twisted and pulled along the skin surface of unwanted hair, lifting hair directly from the follicle. As the facial hair is removed, only a slight pinch is felt.<br>  Eyebrow threading is the perfect facial hair removal alternative to waxing, depilatory creams and tweezing especially if you have sensitive skin. Unlike waxing or the use of depilatories, irritation and skin rashes are avoided as the top layer of your skin is not stripped off in the process of eyebrow theading. Also since eyebrow threading is a completely natural skin hair removal process, eyebrow threading works on all skin types, weather you have normal skin, sensitive skin, tanned or damaged skin.<br>  Eyebrow threading is an inexpensive, safe, simple, fast and affective method of facial hair removal. Eyebrow threading removes facial hair quickly and effectively without damaging the skin.

Trust me, you look a lot better when you get your braces off, so that's something to look forward to! Try a new hairstyle, from my experience, long layers with side bangs makes you look very sophisticated and pretty. Clothes also has to do a lot with your looks. You should wear thing that would make you look taller, like heels, short dress, tight dark jeans, long tank tops, button down tops. Don't wear any horizantal stripes. Vertical ones work tho!<br>  Makeup can help a lot too. Heres wat you have to do: pick an eye shadow that is just a few shades darker than your skin. My skin is tan and I use light brown, and it does wonders! trust me on that. Too much eyeliner looks goth, but a little on the outer sides on the bottom and top look good. Brown would be a good color. Very natural. Mascara also helps a lot. Put two or three coats on your top lashes, and one coat on the bottom. If your wearing a lot of eye make up, put a light lip gloss on your lips, white is very pretty! If your only wearing a little eyemake up, try a darker color lip gloss. Also use foundation and powder to cover up any zits you may have.<br>  Hope I helped, and don't worry, everyone goes through a phase of thinking they aren't pretty!<br>  xoxoxo<br>  juju|`|87959a0bfc5ffda698010df99f0cd0ccaa	well you could always get some makeup<br>  and a some choppy haircut with side bangs<br>  and a new style. makle sure you get some clothes that fit<br>  <br>  but i think what you really need is confidence|`|SmJ8jXwRaa	you shouldn't try to change yourself someone right will come around sometime but if you are asking maybe try being a bit more outgoing.

Once you get it to shoulder length, you are in the clear!  But mostly I just wait it out - about 3 months between trims and if you are coloring it too, be sure to keep regular with that - color helps gives hair volume and keep it looking fresh and updated.

The first step to growing long, beautiful hair is by far the most important. It is absolutely non negotiable for anyone who wants healthy hair at any length, but it is also by far the hardest step you will have to follow. In order to have long healthy hair you absolutely have to start with healthy hair. You must cut off every inch that is considerably damaged. If you are going for extreme length, from that point on you will have to treat your hair like delicate, antique lace at all times. Remember, once your hair is at your waist the ends can be as many as six years old. Your hair will go through a lot of trauma in six years no matter how careful you are with it. Because there is absolutely no way to repair damaged hair, you *must* start out with healthy hair to have healthy hair when it's long, there's no way around it. If your hair is not very damaged up the entire shaft, you may start with a very healthy trim and then continue to trim monthly to maintain your length until all the damage is gone; however, keep in mind that if the amount of damage does not continue to decrease using this method, you didn't remove enough of the damaged hair to begin with and another healthy trim is in order. You'll save precious time by removing as much damage as possible from the very beginning and immediately implementing the steps that follow to your now beautifully healthy hair! Remember, long damaged hair is never as pretty as shorter healthy hair, and because healthy hair needs to be trimmed less often and doesn't break as easily, the result is much faster growth overall. I learned this step the hard way and wasted ten years trying to grow damaged hair I refused to cut... hair that started literally growing like a weed when I finally bit the bullet, did the dirty deed and stopped doing all the horrible nasties that initially resulted in the damage. Duh. Learn from my pain.<br>  <br>  2. Always trim your hair often. Damage to your hair will move up from the ends and the only way to stop the damage in its tracks is to remove it as soon as it happens. Trim hair a half inch every month or so (the average rate of hair growth) if you are maintaining your length. If you are actively growing your hair, trim it a half inch every three or four months. In between trims it is beneficial to sit in bright light and snip any splits off the ends of individual hairs with a good pair of hair cutting scissors that you explain to the men in your house are absolutely not to be used for anything else, especially prying off bottle caps when they can't find the bottle opener, which is of course in the drawer where it belongs if they'd just look. I digress. If you are persistent with this method, regular trims may be able to be postponed even longer. If your hair begins to show damage, it is important to trim it more often! Damaged hair doesn't grow, it breaks, and damage will only increase with time.<br>  <br>  3. If you don't have someone you trust implicitly to trim your hair for you, find a salon that caters to long hair, has a long hair specialist, or at least be sure to glare at your stylist as menacingly as you can while you clearly explain your hair-growth goals before letting her come at you with scissors. It also helps to ask the stylist to show you exactly their perception of the amount of hair you want trimmed by showing you what they think is the same distance from the end of their comb. I am convinced stylists are taught a completely different measuring system from the rest of the world, and not once have I ever had a stylist show me an accurate half inch on her first try. Not once. It also helps to remember, it is not in the best interest of most salons or stylists if you rarely make visits to their salon, which is definitely a conflict of interest! If your hair is short and styled, you are always there spending money for maintenance. If your stylist tries to convince you that your long, healthy hair should be cut, run screaming from the salon immediately! Make sure that anyone whose advice you consider, be it a stylist, friend or family member, has only the best interest of YOUR acknowledged hair growth goals in mind. Otherwise smile politely and ignore every word they say. You absolutely are not too old, too thin, too short, too gray, too anything to have long hair.<br>  <br>  4. Avoid using any heated appliances whenever possible. No blow drying, no curling irons, no hot rollers, and especially no flat irons or crimpers! If you absolutely must blow dry do so minimally, and contrary to popular belief, it is best to let your hair dry naturally for as long as possible and use the blow dryer just to finish it off at the end if you must. If you must use hot rollers, use flocked or soft rollers, not spiked plastic rollers. If you insist on using curling irons, flat irons or crimpers on a daily basis, really long healthy hair isn't in your future. If you do use heat on your hair, be sure to use a product that will help protect your hair from it and kee|`|JkumHzjraa	I heard Mane N Tails shampoo and conditioner helps out a lot for that!

If you are using more than one color, you might want to blend it, so it would be helpful to have a blending brush, too. <br>  Mascara tends to clump, so if you want to fix that problem, you can rotate the applicator or slowly wiggle it as you apply the mascara to your lashes. I would recommend using a volumizing mascara for the upper lashes (I use Colossal) and a lengthening mascara for lower lashes ( I use neutrogena lash tint)<br>  hope this helped...|`|LzZjuOYwaa	Use mineral makeup, its good for your skin and wont give you pimples.|`|hfTpc4RAaa	What do you need help with?

WiEToYGDaa	There is special shampoo you can get anywhere for bad greasy hair.<br>  <br>  If you can't get that then i suggest to not use conditioner when showering.<br>  <br>  -------The best thing to do is ask your hair dresser.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Well, to begin with, Pantene shampoos/conditioners are known to weigh hair down and make it look greasy.  Try using a different shampoo.<br>  Also, make sure you are using enough shampoo.  If your hair is really long, you need to make sure you are fully washing it.  <br>  You didn't mention if you are using any styling products, but I'll assume you are.  Make sure you aren't using to much hair serum or hairspray or anything like that, as they will definitely make your hair look greasy.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	if you use cream and gel and keep in it while sleeping it makes it greasy.|`|cQJGaUK4aa	Use TRESemme' Vitamin C Deep Cleaning Shampoo, your hair is not getting the cleaning it needs. Pantene shampoo coats the hair shaft.<br>  Shampoo 2 times with the TRESemme' and yes scrub your scalp to remove the oil from it.<br>  Try this shampoo a couple of times and it may be that you will be able to go to another shampoo of your choice and use the TRESemme' once a week.<br>  My husband , sister and nephew all use it and they have to use it every time.|`|l3Fx04Ghaa	pantene is good but not for greesy hair.<br>  you should continue using pantene but use a dif. shampoo 2-3 times a week to release the build up.<br>  <br>  also try putting baby powder in your hair and avoid touching your hair:)<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|K4Qfueobaa	i hav the same problem. my reason is bvecause i have oily skin. That might be ur reason but idk|`|PkdBJzmqaa	I`m blonde aswell and often have the same problem. Here`s my tip: after drying your hair but before straightening it, but a dime sized amount of conditioner in your hand and run it through your hair. Also when you are washing your hair in the shower, don`t rub in your roots too much because they can hold on to the shampoo and conditioner, making your hair look greasy although you just washed it.|`|WHgMOa3Aaa	Well first it might be if you play sports alot..;]? Or... doctors say its not a really good idea tew take shower everyday its bad for yew. Also it might be because of ur shampoo? idk but here is my anwser ;D Here are some sources;]|`|IWQvxcZxaa	sometimes if you dont wash out<br>  your shampoo all the way it<br>  can make your hair look greasy<br>  or it could just be the shampoo youre<br>  using. I had one and no matter what<br>  i did it always looked greasy<br>  hope i helped?|`|toDEswtEaa	Try not straightening your hair and see what it looks like.

I think something that falls just above the knee would look best. If you decide against a solid color, then choose one with a larger print. If you pick one with spaghetti or thin straps, or even strapless, make sure you have a sweater to wear with it or it will be innapropriate. Wear a low heel or flats, because you will be standing a lot. Also, be sure you can move around comfortably in whatever you choose. <br>  <br>  If you are going to some sort of party or function afterwards, dont get a white, grey, or light colored dress, because you may sweat through it. Leggings are great if you are worried about "sitting like a lady" of if you want more mobility.|`|cbEOXkugaa	Here's some that I think you might like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=349353&CategoryID=18109" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=361434&CategoryID=26682" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=357885&CategoryID=26682" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=356437&CategoryID=26682" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dillards.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=301&langId=-1&storeId=301&productId=501815535&N=1000930+4294967275&searchUrl=%2Fendeca%2FEndecaStartServlet%3FN%3D1000930%2B4294967275&R=02859062" rel="nofollow">http://www.dillards.com/webapp/wcs/store...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dillards.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=301&langId=-1&storeId=301&productId=501817949&view=20&No=20&N=1000930+4294967275&searchUrl=%2Fendeca%2FEndecaStartServlet%3Fview%3D20%26No%3D20%26N%3D1000930%2B4294967275&R=03000982" rel="nofollow">http://www.dillards.com/webapp/wcs/store...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dillards.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=301&langId=-1&storeId=301&productId=501774570&N=1000930&searchUrl=%2Fendeca%2FEndecaStartServlet%3FN%3D1000930&R=02999445" rel="nofollow">http://www.dillards.com/webapp/wcs/store...</a>|`|wp3vYFB9aa	try black and long with a cool necklace.. i wore a crystal for my graduation..|`|WHgMOa3Aaa	Well I don't kno ur type but I have a whole bunch of dresses ;] xD

LPxKxA6Taa	okay to start off if you pop a pimple and has a dark spot it means that some of the oil from the pimple is still inside your skin. so what you do is just leave it to heal and the black mark will slowly go away. so while this goes on, wash your face with sugar. not brown sugar. simply put water on your face and rub sugar on your face before you go to bed. a couple days later pop that black dark spot and an oil will come out. =)|`|nZgZWrGWaa	Why cant you go to stores?

All it teaches is that beauty is the only thing that is worth in the world. If your daughter just wants to do it for fun thats okay, but there are many people who take beauty pagents seriously. And when you meet a real beauty pagent contestant, most are all shallow, vain, and would do anything for a compliment. Also they would lash out thier suppresed feeling in typhoons.|`|cc55705874683a19d818a68ca886c745aa	i know im not exactly answering your question, but i wouldnt let my daughter in a pagent. it kills self esteem and it puts a lot of pressure on the child. one of my friends started her daughter in pagents at 9 and she is 11 now and she has and eating disorder and has tried to kill herself 3 times because of things that have been said to her by other competing girls and the people running the pagent.|`|SkXr0Ybyaa	i looked and looked for any listings on google but then i couldnt find any... im sorry i feel bad... but maybe you can get a refferal from a friend or im 100 % sure if you search to the nitty gritty (strang word haha) you will definatley find a pagent somehwere.... sorry :-/ i tried|`|d7HVQI0qaa	beauty pageants are horrible!<br>  you should be ashamed of yourself as a parent.
cQNOWMktaa	No.<br>  alternative and Goth.<br>  Uh, do you wanna look goth? Then yes.|`|TssgwSyvaa	i think the color of your eye shadow is pretty and it usually looks good with black hair, but it pretty much always works. it wno't look like you have pink eye because it's not in the white of your eyes. as long as people can see the whites of your eyes, you won't look like you have pink eye. If anything, your eye shadow should bring out the whites because it's a different color. I'm no so sure about the black lipstick. It looks good on certain models in magazines but in real life, i'm not sure many people can pull it off. i wouldn't wear black lipstick because it also might seem like you're trying to hard, but if you think it looks good then i guess it's okay.|`|3r5zRDTEaa	um no

H94VTSjaaa	Brand-name drugs are generally given patent protection for 20 years from the date of submission of the patent. This provides protection for the innovator who laid out the initial costs (including research, development, and marketing expenses) to develop the new drug. However, when the patent expires, other drug companies can introduce competitive generic versions, but only after they have been thoroughly tested by the manufacturer and approved by the FDA.<br>  <br>  A generic drug is a copy that is the same as a brand-name drug in dosage, safety, strength, how it is taken, quality, performance and intended use.<br>  <br>  FDA requires that all drugs be safe and effective. Since generics use the same active ingredients and are shown to work the same way in the body, they have the same risks and benefits as their brand-name counterparts.<br>  <br>  Generic Propecia is a smart way to get the benefits of the brand drug Propecia at a low price range. It is a cost effective way to achieve healthy hair re-growth.<br>  <br>  Generic Propecia constitutes the same active ingredient Finasteride, and has the similar course of action that is of reducing the formation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the scalp, facilitating hair re-gtrowth. Generic Propecia is available at: <a href="http://www.onlinepharmacyrx.org/index.php?p=drug&drugBrandId=22" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinepharmacyrx.org/index.ph...</a>|`|k9Mn8J5Eaa	Before you start using the either one, you need to check the side effects of both.

As for this girl, it depends on her <br>  a) clothes- if she's wearing jeans that are low in the back, she's probably just showing her thong off<br>  <br>  b) attitude-kind of a no brainer.

naPq2mbtaa	1. Pour 3 ounces of creme developer into plastic mixing bowl along with 2 scoops of bleaching powder in a room with windows. This stuff is not healthy to breathe in a closed up room!<br>     2. Put on your Goggles. DO NOT forget the goggles, or if you have eyeglasses, add tape around them to protect your eyes. Seriously ladies, one small drop of this in your eye will cause you to go blind for the rest of your life. It's not worth the risk. This stuff can splatter in your face when you begin flipping your hair over to add more.<br>     3. Commence mixing the bleach and developer mixture.<br>     4. Part your hair in 4 sections. Start at the back and DO NOT start at your roots or else you will come out with lighter roots and darker ends.<br>     5. Add bleach all over your head, keeping 1 1/2 away from your roots.<br>     6. Put the clear or white plastic bag over your head and tie it at the nape of your neck making sure all of your hair is tucked underneath the bag.<br>     7. Leave it like this for 40 minutes.<br>     8. After 40 min. make a hole in the bag large enough to fit the nozzle of your hair blow dryer and begin blowing hot air into the plastic bag. What we are doing here is activating the bleaching process by adding heat. #Keep blowing hot air for 10 or so minutes.<br>     9. Do not do the roots yet. After about an hour or so shampoo your hair with the shimmer lights toning shampoo and then DEEP condition it with Pantene hair conditioner.<br>    10. Wash out and blow dry COMPLETELY.<br>    11. Repeat the process of adding bleach to your hair, heating with hot air, washing/conditioning it, blowdrying again. Do this 6 times. This is a very painful process because now you will be doing your roots and it will sting.<br>    12. On the 2nd repeat, do your root and say OUCH!<br>            * NOTE: You do not want to leave bleach on your hair for over an hour. You will destroy your hair and you will not get dates. This is why you must repeat this process 6 times or until your hair is a deep blonde. ALWAYS condition in between! The goal for today is not to get it platinum blonde. Marylin Monroe was not born platinum blonde, silly. It took her time too! You want to go deep blonde because if you have black hair, you need to give it time to heal as well as your scalp for heavens sake!<br>    13. Ok, so wait 24 hrs. or more. Your hair should now be a deep blonde or a reddish blonde.<br>    14. Now, do some more bleaching, and heating until you get to your desired color blonde or platinum.<br>    15. Wait another day before adding the toner.(add Enya music... You are like a Swan going through transformations!)music fades...<br>    16. PUT GOGGLES ON...After 24hrs. or more, mix toner in plastic container with 30 volume creme developer (read directions on toner). Depending on how golden or platinum you want to be, add drops of Ardell's "Lock in Blonde". The more you add, the more golden blonde your hair will be. If you pass this, that's fine. Your hair will not be as crispy blonde. I personally like to add about 18 drops to give my hair a bit of color/golden platinum feel to it.<br>    17. After 40 minutes,(read directions on toner) wash, condition and dry.<br>    18. Welcome to the club...You are now a bonafide blonde bombshell!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Alternate Method<br>  <br>      * Bleaching your hair is simple. If you buy ingredients separately rather than in a kit, it is cheap. You can bleach your hair, then mix small amounts of the chemicals later to touch up your roots.<br>  <br>     1.<br>            * Note: You should wear a button down shirt or a loose fitting top so that you can take off your shirt to rinse your hair without getting bleach all over your clothes.<br>     2. Brush out your hair. Mix the chemicals. Put on the gloves. Paint the bleach mixture onto a small, thin section of hair at a time. You can put foil under a section of hair, paint on the bleach, then wrap up that section in foil if you like.<br>     3. Avoid putting the bleach directly onto your scalp. If you do, it will sting or burn a little bit.<br>     4. Once all your hair is covered in bleach, put on a bandanna or plastic shower cap.<br>     5. Once your hair looks light enough, rinse out the bleach. Using a gentle color-fast conditioner afterwards is a good idea.<br>     6. The difficulty in hair bleaching is that you might underbleach dark hair, resulting in an orangey tone. If this happens you might wait an hour or two and then bleach it some more.<br>     7. If you over-bleach, your hair might end up feeling a little bit straw-like and brittle. If you're in doubt, rinse it out.<br>            * Note on the chemistry: The developer and the powder react chemically. After a while they'll stop reacting and your hair won't bleach any more.<br>     8. You may also wish to put more bleach, earlier, on whichever part of your hair is darker. So if your roots are dark and the rest of your hair has been bleached before, bleach the roots for 15 or 30 minutes longer than the rest of your hair. If your roots are light or blonde and the rest of your hair is darker, p

Just don't listen to them.<br>  <br>  How they judge you really depends on what you're wearing, in my school if you wear short skirts, small shirt, piercings then you are automatically called a slut, well from the mean ones that is. If you dress like a teacher everyday then you are a teacher's pet/nerd.<br>  <br>  You would really have to experience the first day of high school to know how the students react to how others dress.

39f1e02605bcff32190bb274c182020baa	Because your hair is so long, when you're winding your hair on the iron, you're overlapping and overlapping, so the top area has several layers of hair blocking it from the heat. You can try to curl the end sections, and then do it again to the top section, leaving the already curled ends out. It should help, but it might take a few times to get it right. Good luck!|`|1848c606ec57cd6ca132ec3ec8b3bc42aa	do smaller pieces of hair and go up through the hair and wind the hair around the curler with the ends last , instead of curling the ends first, tht will help|`|242c3dfab5d3cfde20bccbf85b744b1baa	Same thing kinda happens with me!<br>  <br>  would it help if you do it in two sections, like just do the top of the strand, then do the end?<br>  <br>  it could be possible that the top of your hair isnt touching the hot part of the curler..<br>  <br>  hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Good luck with ur hair! = ]|`|3lQclbM0aa	Keep you heat high and while your hair is on the iron give it a spritz of hairspray.

I do people's hair all the time, and when it comes to curling long hair that's what works the best. Then you can use the curling iron for any touch-ups. Both products are sold at Wal-Mart. It also matters what kind of hair spray you use. You need a good hold without makning them hard.

(on a cotton square, moisten w/water then add a 1-2 drops of oil. Gently dab on pimples.)  Another essential I recommend is 100% aloe Vera gel(no color or fragrance added) the one I use is made by Fruit of the Earth. generously apply all over face at night. your face will feel so good in the morning, seriously! Remember this Aloe Vera is a anti inflammatory so it has soothing and cooling properties......tea tree oil is a natural anti fungal oil. you can use it for many things,google it!<br>  <br>  FYI...stop using proactiv. and drink lots of water because you are what you eat.

f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	One of the most effective surgeries for women with stretch marks on their stomach from a pregnancy is a tummy tuck. The tummy tuck gets rid of extra skin and fat, making the stomach tighter and nicely shaped. In the process of this skin removal, stretch marks below your belly button are usually removed as well. <br>  <br>  Another option is laser surgery. This type of stretch marks surgery is generally only for people whose stretch marks are still colored red or brownish. If your stretch marks have faded to more of a flesh color the laser will not be able to detect them. This surgery is effectively able to remove damaged skin and stimulate collagen growth, but may not always completely eliminate stretch marks. <br>  <br>  Laser surgery can also become incredibly expensive. Each session can cost as much as $1000 or more, and depending on how quickly your skin reacts to the surgery, you may need multiple sessions of laser surgery before your stretch marks fade or go away.  <br>  <br>  If you are interested in more effective ways of getting rid of stretch marks, you can read abt them from this site: <a href="http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.co...</a>

0OWnHFEXaa	Basically if you want to grow your hair long, trim dead ends when you have them, try to avoid hair dryers or other things with heat (though your a boy so this shouldn't be a problem), dying your hair is damaging, a blast of cold water after a hot shower is good for your hair (and also skin), there are vitamins out there that help keep your hair healthy as it grows, good diet is key, be careful when your hair is wet, no rough towel drying, dry your hair naturally, comb NEVER brush when wet, etc.<br>  <br>  These are things I know because I have long hair but I'm not a guy.

pKI2bD8paa	My friend and I were actually talking about this yesterday.  For Teto's wig, she suggested finding a pink wig and making pigtails.  Then you would wrap the pigtails around Plastic cups (or something larger) and hairspray them to death XD  Then you would take the cups out right before wherever you are going.  Could take a bit of work and A LOT of patience, but it might do the trick.<br>  <br>  For Miku and Neru I would just suggest Finding the right length wig, and if you can't find the color, then just dye it with hairspray, you can put it into ponytails yourself.<br>  <br>  Whenever I make a cosplay I'm always on a tight budget, so I would never buy the $50-60 wigs online, but If that's the way you want to go, they are available.

MnoZNdI0aa	steps: <br>  <br>  Choose an eyeliner appropriate for your eye color . Browns, gilded bronzes, and plums are great for lighter eyes and dark eyes can pull off a more drastic black backdrop. Silvers and charcoals look best on green and blue eyes; rich red browns for blue eyes and golds for green eyes. *Note: Red tints make eyes look redder and blues make them whiter. Make sure your liner complements the color of your shadow. <br>   <br>  So many to choose fromConsider the type of look you're after . Pencil eyeliner gives your eyes soft definition, while liquid versions offer precision and drama. You can also moisten dark eye shadow and apply it with a small, flat brush to double as liner. <br>  Prepare to apply the eyeliner .<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are using a pencil, sharpen it (see Warnings). Warm and soften the very tip of the pencil by heating it with a hot zap from a hair dryer. This will help it write smoother. <br>  A liquid liner should be checked for clumps or excess. <br>  *Prepare your smudging pencil and/or brushes. <br>  Prepare a cake liner or a dark eye shadow by applying a small amount of water (usually one or two drops) to your brush. Move the wet brush gently through your cake liner or dark shadow. Hold the brush or pencil as you would hold a pen. <br>   <br>  Rest the elbow of your dominant arm on a hard surface , and rest your wrist on your face. <br>  <br>  Tilt your head back slightly and bring your eyes to a half-open state. This creates a good angle for application, while allowing you to see what you're doing. <br>  <br>  Line the lower lids . Some people put the liner just below the lower lashes, while others prefer to put it on the rim of the eye, above the lashes (see Warnings), or even on the upper innerlash rim (if you're super skilled, careful, and daring!). Moving from the outside edge inward, draw a line lightly, but don't go for perfection, you can go back over the faint line and darken after the stroke. Your line should be slightly thicker at the outside corner, becoming thinner as it moves in toward your nose. Follow the shape of your eye! It looks more natural. <br>  <br>  TIPS:<br>  To make sharpening an eyeliner pencil a little easier, store it in the refrigerator or freezer. This will harden it, which will make for easier sharpening as the tip will not smudge or break as often. <br>  Wash brushes regularly with makeup remover or a mild gel shampoo. <br>  As we age, the eyelid wrinkles, making it difficult to line with a pencil. Get a really soft pencil, even a fat, eyeshadow pencil. Draw the line as close to the lashes as possible. Then smudge upwards, creating the effect of the darker area near the hairs and lighter as it goes upward. <br>  Another trick for mature eyelids if you want to use the liquid liner and have a more defined line: Apply over bare skin, very close to your upper lash line. Smudge slightly before it dries without blending upward. Once it has dried, apply a small amount of natural looking, neutral shadow using a soft shadow brush over the liner and lid. Follow the same instructions for your lower lash liner. Continue with your shadowing. This will eliminate the wrinkled look and give you a smoky softer appearance. <br>  If your skin is very dry, you will have a problem smudging, so you may want to use a very light cold cream on your face and then wipe it off before applying. This leaves just enough moisture to allow the pigment to move over the skin surface. <br>  Use an excellent quality brush. It must be a flat brush that will form a chiseled edge when wet. It is best if it is cut at an angle. <br>  Try using liquid eyeliner for the top part of your eyes and the pencil for bottom. It tends to look better. <br>  Put the eyeliner directly onto your lower lashline, not above or below it. <br>  If you have watery eyes, buy an eyeliner that will suit you that is hypoalergenic. Or else, you can put a skin coloured loose eyeshadown under your bottom lashes, then apply. It will help it stay on better. <br>  Use eyeliner after you've applied eye shadow and before applying mascara. <br>  Practice makes perfect You may find eyeliner, particularly the liquid version, difficult and messy the first few times. Practice and have patience. <br>  <br>  <br>  WARNINGS:<br>  <br>  Avoid sharing your eyeliner with others as this can transmit bacteria and infection from person to person. If you must share, swipe the tip with a bit of makeup remover or rubbing alcohol and rinse the liquid off. <br>  Lining the inside of the lower lid may cause eye infections, and it greatly increases the risk of getting makeup in your eye. <br>  When you sharpen an eyeliner pencil, don't sharpen it too much and do not sharpen it to a point. If you do this, the tip of the pencil can crumble and get in your eye.|`|WyJ5WNVsaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1hc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1...</a><br>  <br>  shes awsome! watch it. very good advice|`|7oetZ4I3aa	well top lid: apply it from the inner corner of your eye to the outer along the lash line start out thinly then gradually get a little thicker, remember it looks thicker with your eye open then closed so even if it looks barely visible when you applying it when you open your eye it will look fine<br>  <br>  lower lid: pull your lower lid down and just apply the amount of thickness you would like the whole way across|`|n8BwNCIdaa	If you want your eyes to look wider, don't put eyeliner all the way along your lower lip, just put it on the outer half of your lid. It will emphasize and define your eyes while also making them look wider! Wearing eyeliner on the whole of your lower lid can sometimes make your eyes look really small.|`|UvSnEWHjaa	watch this video <br>  it helped me

They are typically considered skater jeans because of product placement, but you can wear them with whatever you want. Make them your own. <br>  <br>  Whats great about these jeans is that they are universal, you can dress them up or down. They look great with a light blazer. My sister has a pair and they look best with sneakers or flats. Don't attempt to wear heels, because they may make you seem top heavy.<br>  <br>  regardless of skin color, wear whatever make you feel good. Remember, with whatever you wear, if you are not comfortable, then the outfit wont look good.

3L9bRmOqaa	If you are a member of the US Military or a military dependent, you can buy current authentic handbags at the US Navy Exchange (they sell Coach cheaper than retail only for the military and their dependents.  They are an authorized retailer.).  My only other suggestion is to check the counters at Dillards.  They usually have unadvertised sales of Coach bags.  They are in a glass counter separate from the regular priced Coach bags or behind the register. Just ask the salesclerk.

If I asked others to describe a goth, they would say black clothing and makeup and generally a sad or angry look on their face. When you choose to wear clothing and makeup that fits a stereotype, you must also accept the responsibility of being unjustly identified with the group whether you like it or not.|`|81974ba8322795f4f27bd6b013dc7d15aa	Black is the color that goth started with.

So basically use the new relaxer when your due for your new retouch, i.e every six weeks and counting. However personally speaking i don't recommend relaxers, they do far more damage then they do good. I would suggest instead that you go n natural and flat iron for straight look, twist and rease for sexy wavy/curly look. If you feel you need chemical straightner, try a texturiser ( a weak relaxer), you will find your hair will be much more full of body, grow longer and be overall very healthy.
GxXYnXOwaa	First of all, when your hair is still damp, put some mousse or gel or whatever you prefer in your hair.  Flip your hair upside down, then take your blowdryer (with diffuser attached), and sort cup your hair up towards your head,  hold for a few seconds, then let your hair down.  Keep doing this until your hair is pretty much dry, don't over do it because it can make your curls look frizzy.  Then when you flip your hair back up, spray with hairspray, and there you go.  You can keep your hair down and curly, or put half of it up in a half up-do!!!  Hope this helps.  Good Luck!!!!|`|AA12067398	You just click the diffuser attachment on to your dryer and then use the dryer on a low setting.  You hold the diffuser up close to your scalp and gently move it around to dry the roots first.  Then you can dry portions of the lower part of your hair by loosely running the diffuser through.  I always use some time of non frizz serum before I start as well.  Good luck!|`|RidVgHhZaa	Glad to help.<br>  put your products in your hair and then flip your head down where your hair is hanging towards the floor. Scrunch your hair up, but not with your hands with the diffuser. I wouldn't use such high heat because then you'll have little fly aways|`|StFraZ2iaa	U slip it onto the nose of the dryer,i put mine on low,and blow dry with dryer upside down and scrunchin ur hair with ur other hand.gives nice curls.good luck.|`|bf3bacc61ca5934e14f6b5ed85844f42aa	well you have the attachment. just simply place it on chica. and if you want to keep the curls in go "low dry" it gets the job done but leaves the fullness of the curls. and the diffuser really doesn't prevent the loss of curls just don't bring the hair dryer to close to your head. =] good luck missy. have a great hair day!|`|cWBsLpjwaa	Usually you need to buy a special hair dryer that comes with a diffuser cuz only certain hair dryers allow the diffuser attachment. A diffuser is a big fat circle thing with holes in it. You just attatch it to the end of the dryer and blow dry your hair like you normally do. Just don't hit your head with it when your blowdrying I've done it several times.<br>  This is what it looks like<br>  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=162074&catid=29109&aid=335944&aparam=chi_pro_low_emf_professio" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.a...</a>

d30ee6711af246b1e3792e58c25dcda3aa	The common story that is told to explain the origin of the term "tennis bracelet" has to do with tennis player Chris Evert. <br>  <br>  Supposedly in the 80's, Chris (who was the #1 female player and had won quite a few Grand Slams) was wearing a diamond bracelet while playing in the U.S. Open. During the match, the bracelet broke and the game was halted so that she could gather up all of the diamonds that were scattered around.<br>  <br>  Due to that incident, people started to refer to those straight, delicate kinds of bracelets as "tennis bracelets". Hope this helps you!|`|e2dfd7eb65d0d2120a4565407a8c2ee7aa	Charlene is 100% correct. Before 1987's match, it was just a "diamond bracelet."

zlXofrG4aa	Scars only occur when you have a wound.  If you stretch your ears properly you shouldn't get any wounds.<br>  And about the closing up part, it all depends on your body and how big you go.  I've seen people take out 1/2" and their ears have closed all the way up after 3 years.  I'm at 1" and if I were to take mine out I'd have trouble putting them in a couple hours from now.  Within a couple months there would be a sufficient amount of closure but I could probably stick a pencil in it still.  Within a few years they might close up but would still be around a 2g.

d48050e638d4ea7255fde45918580919aa	I just started proactiv recently. I like it a lot! I didn't have really bad skin, just a couple stubborn zitties. I got the free trial of it, which was really nice. It's a month's supply plus the refining mask....I got something in the mail for it from one of my magazines, and it wasn't a scam surprisingly....hahaha. Well, anyways, my face is almost completely cleared up...and it doesn't dry out my skin, which is great! haha. I think its like $40 for the set of 3 products, the big bottles of cleanser, toner, and lotion, and you usually get the free refining mask. The big bottles last around 3 months, so its not too expensive...about $13 a month. Look on proactiv.com ! It has all the pictures and stories and ordering stuff....they have like 8 million different products! Great great stuff. I'd definately try it! It works wayyyyyyyy better than the stuff at target, if you have bad zits.|`|3399cd627af11174f76d3e7d791f9ad3aa	yeah. it's great it cost like $50?. it works fast and good for some, and others not that much.|`|5f762d8b539048d60701bb8775cb5fd1aa	i have clear skin but my husband uses it and he swears it works great.|`|SXZYPJyXaa	I've always had horrible skin.

vUBWDfCeaa	That's dead skin cells, dirt, oils, and dust, kid. When you shower, take your jewelry out and wash those ears! Wooden jewelry helps with this a lot.<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically it's pretty much the same thing as belly button lint. As long as your piercing is not painful or swollen and there's no gross discharge, it is healthy. This smell can vary in people, no matter how often they clean their lobes.<br>  usually the smell is worse with plastic and metal jewelry because they trap more bacteria.<br>  <br>  I know someone who removes his plugs every night and moisturizes the holes (his ears never smell!) yet if I do this they shrink up slightly causing me pain to re-insert the same size jewelery.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Get some sea salt & mix with water.

Hot rollers are the best. spray your hair lightly with some heat styling spray before you put on teh roller, and roll it inwards all the way to your scalp. Then you wait about 30 min and take them out. :D. and spray with some hairspray.<br>  and then you got pretty curls :)|`|4ndUXgUCaa	try one of those 1-2" curling irons. they work really well. but they dont hold as long as hot rollers.

KGppArcfaa	Yes!!! Theres lots of stuff you can get! and they work!<br>  Ok you can try Ardell brow and Lash Growth Accelerator, this one works really good, its $4 at walgreens and stuff, but if it gets in your eye it hurts (and its best to apply on the lash line so its hard to not get it in your eye) and it expires quick.<br>  <br>  There is also Talika Lipocils, you can get this from Sephora or cheaper on ebay. Its $35 but will last a couple months. They guarantee lash growth in 28 days if you apply 2 times a day. I used it twice a day for 15 days cuz by than my lashes were so long they looked fake!

ltSsoysVaa	Hiya i got mine done a week ago and it was ￡20 for normal stud and if you want like gem in it it was ￡23 but anyway she froze mine so i did'nt really feel any pain but alot of ppl have said it doesn't hurt but everyones different.They pierce it with a needle (: and the piercer should tell you how to clean it.I clean mine with just 1/4 of SEA salt on a teaspoon and half a jug of hot water but not real hot.(small jug aswel) But ye the piercer should tell you what to clean it with. x :]|`|jw72N1moaa	I paid ￡27 for mine. Didn't hurt as much as I was anticipating, just a small pinch. They clamp it and use a needle to pierce it (well they should, it's illegal to use a gun to pierce cartilage)<br>  <br>  Youtube it to see how it is done|`|JFr7fCiXaa	i had mine done 3 years ago, didnt hurt too much think it was under ￡20 and they just shove a needle is as with anything else. definately worth doing it, go for it!|`|dI9BLGYpaa	I've heard it's one of the most painful piercings you can get. There are lots of nerves there.|`|wFXM8155aa	I got mine done about 4 years ago now, it was only ￡15 to get pierced with a bar in it. It pinched abit but hurt more afterwards because I kept catching it with my hairbrush!<br>  Its well worth getting it done though, its a cute piercing!|`|TdGbIDH8aa	It doesn't hurt that bad.<br>  It is around $30-$45<br>  They just put a needle through it :)|`|lc2WYfeTaa	I have it done and they basically dot it and then they clamp it and they have to bend the needle before they put it through..then they push the needle through it didn't hurt so much getting it done but the sound was a little much!! It was big crunch sound!! It is sore for quite some time after but I've had mine atl least 5 years and I haven't had any problems!! As far as price I think I paid $50.00 for mine but it depends where you live!!!
VPkuM2xWaa	He likes tattoos|`|kCdISEGqaa	I first look at the layout and design of the tattoos.  I then get curious and ask to take a closer look.  My husband gets so frustrated when I do that, but, I love to see other peoples' tattoos.  If they are done well, they are very sexy.  Just my thoughts though.|`|QikvnTnqaa	It totally depends on how he's carrying himself. If he's acting like he's the king of the world...I do tend to back off a little. But I think most full body tattoos are awesome. :D  If he's nice guy, who cares what he has?|`|HLmd17r9aa	Usually I think they are hot.<br>  :)<br>  Sometimes I look at the artwork and wonder why they got the tattoos they did.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	If they are nice,and he is cute,i'll go up to him are talk to him..Tattoos are always a conversation starter... If they are nice i think "nice work" lol|`|53e1c3e3cf69dd882ecfbbb50e404730aa	if well done,cool,lets get a better look.<br>  if badly done and a mishmash of who knows what,well i′d better not say or i might get thrown out,yet again!!  :o)|`|6zblh7Tiaa	Oh my god he must be a criminal, or Hey thats me in the mirror.|`|rjac15O0aa	He looks like me...|`|emUJYL0caa	completely and utterly depends on the location and style of the tattoos. if they've got them, for instance, on the neck, legs, hands or face i would think 'Ewwww SKANK' if they were on the upper arms, shoulders, upper back i'd think nice! it also depends on the quality of the tattoo and style of the artist. some tattoos just look sh-tty, and some look really hot.|`|4971857875f57116cbbe1c9b012b72c2aa	Tattoos are sexy when they are done properly.|`|JLNX5nnwaa	It is a major turn on lol<br>  I love a guy with tattoos.|`|QGZBlceuaa	I think he likes tattoos.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	as long as they are tasteful and well done, i think NICE!|`|OXNiEDROaa	HAWT|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	It totally depends on the kind of guy and kind of tattoos.<br>  <br>  If it's a fat old man with blurry faded bluish sleeves, I either don't think anything or I think 'I bet he wishes he'd kept on top of them'.<br>  <br>  If it's someone with fresh looking tattoos I'll be interested in the style and think either 'hey, nice work!' or 'done well but not my cup of tea' or 'unoriginal' or 'what a terrible artist that guy must have used' etc. If they are really amazing and in a style I love I will often ask about them and what artist he used.<br>  <br>  Either way, I wouldn't judge the person based on the tattoos. I don't think great tattoos make someone sexy, they may enhance sexiness on an already good looking person, but I don't automatically give someone fitness cred just because they've spent a few hours under the needle. But if it was a guy I already would have thought 'yummm' about, if he had great tattoos it might be more like 'yummm-mmeee' if you know what I mean!|`|awskuSGBaa	Depends how they look.<br>  <br>  Crappy--> Either he has poor taste in art or he is scary.<br>  <br>  Quality--> He must have a good job that lets him look like that, and to pay for the ink. A walking expression of his artistic values and lifestyle.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	It totally depends on the content, quality, and placement of the tattoos. It could look pretty cool or it could look really skanky.|`|3llK5y7Baa	it depends how he looks and how the tattoos look=)<br>  usually i think it is hot but if he is some cholo with black and white tattoos then i get grossed out and want to stay far away from him=/|`|MV0lMuDMaa	guys with tattoos are hot.

klUbkO6Laa	not too bad. my piercer said take a deep breath on one, on two slowly release, and by time he got to three it was done.<br>  its really nothing, when they put the jewelry in, now that hurts a little bit more than the needle going through. and plus they put clamps/forceps on the skin, so it pinches the nerves, and you dont really feel it.<br>  1,2,3|`|QikvnTnqaa	Yes it does. But get it done professionally. Safer any way you look at it. <br>  <br>  If you really want it. That pain is nothing and it goes away. Just make sure you get it on a day were you don't have a physical obligations. i.e. sports, work (if you do alot of moving around), ect... I did that and it sucked! LOL<br>  <br>  Also, be sure to clean it 10 times better then what your piercer says. If it gets infected, it WILL hurt. BAD. Mine did. Oh man, definitely something you don't want to happen. So clean it good. Even if it hurts. Because the pain from cleaning it is nothing compared to it being infected.<br>  <br>  But it is worth it! I'm glad I have mine!!! :P|`|QGZBlceuaa	Needle going through your skin... YES, it hurts.<br>  <br>  The pain isn't so bad, it's only temporary.

I mean I doubt that any parts of a pig would have touched it and I guess I'd avoid anything too flashy with engraved images on it.<br>  <br>  As for the people who say you shouldn't wear it for fashion, I'd have to say go try them on and then ask your wife or girl friend how you look since they should have a good fashion sense provided you don't keep her in a house all day under a bed sheet.|`|ie5AKYToaa	Go back and learn some TOLERANCE you stereotypical pig.<br>  <br>  Your question is obviously an attempt to make fun of other religions.|`|Ok8izt2iaa	wtf? of course wear what u want on ur feet ur religion shudnt mess with ur footwear... wow|`|cRN6TRVPaa	As a fashionist, please don't.|`|ykZtnI88aa	fashion-<br>  <a href="http://kotke.info/" rel="nofollow">http://kotke.info/</a><br>  fashion-<br>  <a href="http://kotke.info/" rel="nofollow">http://kotke.info/</a><br>  fashion-<br>  <a href="http://kotke.info/" rel="nofollow">http://kotke.info/</a><br>  fashion-<br>  <a href="http://kotke.info/" rel="nofollow">http://kotke.info/</a>|`|8089f09c29368afeb07f9ba89595f610aa	As a muslim shouldn't YOU know whether or not it is allowed?

4DYZ3JZBaa	ok well first of all you're very pretty so anything will look good on you lol :)<br>  second of all who ever commented it was ugly or that you shouldn't do it don't listen<br>  you can do w/e you want with your hair<br>  if you want to dye it..cut it..etc. that's on you<br>  so don't listen to other people :) (not even me..if you want to lol)<br>  <br>  anyway...a good advice so you wont damage your hair so much<br>  you can either keep the color you have now or if you want dye it a little lighter<br>  AND get extensions for the other color you want <br>  so you wont damage it so much :)<br>  that's what i did..i wanted the same thing<br>  except backwards, black on top and blonde almost white on bottom<br>  so i just dyed my top black since it was already dark brown<br>  and got light blonde extensions..it looks very pretty :]<br>  <br>  also...if YOU do get split ends<br>  or it gets damaged a little<br>  i strongly recommend "Aussie 3 Minute Miracle"<br>  it is super good!!<br>  it leaves your hair very smooth and shiny<br>  and it gets rid of the damage<br>  plus it gave my hair more volume :)<br>  <br>  hope this helps <br>  and have fun w/ your new hair style girly :D<br>  this is how mine looks:<br>  <a href="http://s91.photobucket.com/albums/k300/luvmelissa04/?action=view&current=windy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s91.photobucket.com/albums/k300/l...</a>|`|C1aifz3Waa	thats how my hair is.<br>  and yes it'll look nice on anyone as long as u get it cut to fit you.<br>  but the girl in the pic clearly has extensions and so do i.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Idk it looks like a scene haircut and you kinda look like a preppy little girl :D|`|7CF1WKjMaa	Ew no keep your hair the way it is, dont dye your hair, you look way too young to be dying it. and if you start dying it you will get into habit of it and that;s not good, YOU WILL HAVE DRIED OUT SPLIT ENDS COMING FROM CHINA IN YOUR HAIR!|`|YnEKOJayaa	that would be cute on you<br>  i have scene hair too<br>  and i get compliments and criticized <br>  so be ready for both ways<br>  :)|`|27GRlGewaa	Yep.

oUtex7ckaa	I think you'll look fine.  Don't get a stud in the side though, they almost always come off as trashy.<br>  <br>  As for you being 15, I don't know about other countries but I doubt you can get it done without parent's permission in the USA (professionally at any rate, but I suggest you DON'T let someone else do it).  It's good you'd rather ask permission from your parents though, there's no point in angering them over something as silly as a nose piercing.  I have no clue how you'd start that conversation though, I waited till I was 18 before I got my tattoos and piercings and by then my grandparents didn't really mind anyways.|`|aBmXrFlpaa	well... you're attractive so you can get away with anything. ;) good luck!|`|czYh3jeuaa	i dont think it would look good.<br>  but i dont really like septums much.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Nope I think you should go for a diamond nose stud once again you just don't have the look|`|V7vSs13Kaa	hmm I dont think so <br>  A normal nose piercing would look nice though|`|HLmd17r9aa	First of all, although I think you would suit it, you will need your parents permission. I don't think your nose is too long or anything, I think it would look just find, but since you are only 15, you may have to look around for a shop that will pierce you (with or without parental permission). In my personal opinion, I would wait if I were you. There is a lot of time to get it done. But, if you really want it, and your parents are cool with it, then you should definitely get it.|`|20b4pc5Raa	haven't i already answered this question and been chosen as best answer by you?<br>  <br>  your nose is not TOO long, as you think, and even if it was it wouldn't matter; it doesn't make a difference.<br>  you can start the conversation by saying that you like this piercing and you would like to get it done.|`|2HPa1ETUaa	I think it would look ok, but I think a nose stud would look better. But if you really want septum, go for it.<br>  For you parents, start by asking what they think about facial piercings, then see what they say. If they ask why, just say you would like to get one, one day. Then go from there.|`|e9gsf1GJaa	YES it does.<br>  long noses are better,<br>  cause then you can hide it more and itll stick out.<br>  im going without my parents permission.<br>  just dont bring it up til after.

PPyMhRJAaa	Make sure you pick all the old glue off before you use them again. Just use eye make up remover to gently get rid of the mascara - although it doesn't really matter if there is some left. You can re use them for a while.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Use water or make up remover to clean them. Let them soak in make up remover. Also, make sure you peel all the glue off. You should be able to reuse them a few times if they are a good brand.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	No I tried to reuse mine and it <br>  wasn't pretty :D|`|5cJrnaQaaa	If you get good quality ones..maybe from mac..but the drugstore ones dont last. my mac ones last me 5-6 times with good care.

gxzVSM6Jaa	Whoa friend! check out the website skindeep,from there you will learn about the ingredients it is super scarey and important you know. I'm not talkin like used on animal type info I mean cancer agents etc. Since the latest stats are 1in2 men and 1in3women will have one kind of cancer or another in their life time...well lookin So pretty is one thing but skin cancer etc. is another. Anyhow you want to use a shade as close to your natuaral skin as possible. I assume you have blemishes -we all do- know that if you do choose to wear base, wash face every night! As it doesn't help blemishes to go away when you cover em' then more daily yuck gets on your  skin. Well yeah this is lengthy but it is what it is! So any way since everything seems to cause cancer these days anyhow, sometimes you just live with it and if the skindeep site don't scare ya, I reccomenda base that comes in a small rectangle pack, by CoverGirl. Ultimate finish ~ a liquid powder makeup. comes with a spongy pad, and mirror already on the lid of the pack. You know your skin color, try and get close match...you don't want to see a color line on your jaw bone line, that is the place to see if you've got the right shade, it should 'blend well' . Have fun good luck! P.s. Be in the habit of NOT touching your blemishes! research your diet, and WASH your hands a bagillion times a day if you can't help yourself from touching face! Also running HOT water in a sink and sticking your face next to the stream of steam, place a towel over your head enclosing your head/face steam and all with in the sink space (put towel over your head klike a little head 'fort in the sink. Hella good for the pores, stay put for a minute or two, Best to do that after you've washed, then wipe face down with witch hazel after that is refreshing If not witch haz. then use a toner of sort.<br>  Kay Ciao~ (the proper way to spell Chow)|`|AA11770193	Liquid foundation is meant to match your skin tone and blend in at the jawline into the neck. It helps to even out uneven skin tones and imperfections. Try to stick to clean liquids that are oil and fragrance free so they wont clog pores and they let your skin breathe.I apply my liquid foundation with a beauty sponge. It helps even the application process. Make sure you apply it all over so it doesnt appear blotchy. Also, make it light and even. If your foundation seems to be too dark, find a non-tinted moisturizer and blend it with the foundation before application. It lightens the color. Concealer application depends on what form the concealer is in. If it is a wand, just dab it on and let it set for a moment, then VERY GENTLY blend with your fingertip, being careful not to wipe it off during the blending. Concealer brushes are great application tools for stick or compact concealers. Very easy to apply and blend with. After the liquid foundation and concealer is on, I set it with powder. I use a big foundation brush to apply the powder all over my face. It doesnt matter if the powder is loose or compact, it will work for both. If you use a compact that comes with one of those cotton pads for application, use it carefully. You may use it to apply the powder, but do not use it over the spots that you have used concealer. Since you are applyling pressure when using the cotton pad, it wipes of what you have concealed. Lightly apply the powder with a brush and it will set what you have concealed. Use a fan brush to blend everything in at the jaw and into the neck. I hope this helps!!|`|aa5d63824b58db4fa21ac610d7002746aa	Depending on the formula, you want five small dots, forhead, nose, chin and cheeks. Blend using a foundation brush to the outside as needed. Apply more if necessary, then add concealer to area of blemishes, under eye circles, spots etc and then finish with powder.

TPBfzLqjaa	I wouldn't suggest it.Washing your hair twice a day will strip out all the natural oils your hair produces and needs. This will cause your hair to become dry, brittle, and damaged.|`|fmdoGQizaa	You need to have some natural oils in your hair. By washing it every day you are completely stripping those oils from your hair, it will dry out your hair.<br>  <br>  Start washing it once a day instead.

fmdoGQizaa	That's not true at all, most of the fair people I know do not have flawless skin. Most people wear foundation.<br>  <br>  I take good care of my skin by drinking a lot of water, refraining from alcohol and tobacco, getting lots of sleep, washing my face with cold water in the morning and at night, using skin products like 'Nivea Visage Young' and Blackhead Clean and Clear Daily Scrub. I'm a teenager, teenagers usually have bad skin, but I take good care of my skin and therefore have no need for any make-up at all!<br>  Buy some products that claim to lift oil and dirt. And use a moisturiser. I also find the 'Nivea Lotus Peeling' makes my skin glow ^_^ Definitely try that.|`|7CF1WKjMaa	Exfoliate and drink water and i've seen so many black women with flawless skin, and i would say to myself i wish i had her skin!|`|Fy54FMemaa	Well on the flip side, I have seen some black women with remarkable skin!

96c53c0fc112a834af40518c2abc5411aa	If you have your hair in many small, tight braids or cornrows, they're usually damaging to your hair, however, large braids are actually beneficial. As far as the thinning hair, it's probably just your hormones acting up. Try taking a vitamin that includes biotin. Also, mane and tail shampoo and conditioner makes hair appear thicker, and strengthens it. Just don't use too much conditioner (it's highly concentrated, and needs to be diluted for human use) as it builds up easily and can form a gooey waxy cover on the hair. <br>  <br>  Also, don't over brush your hair and don't wash it every day. The hair's natural oils are good for it, and shampoo removes them. Try to shampoo only 3 times a week. You need to make sure you are eating healthy food and drinking LOTS of water to improve your hair's state. Also, buy some hair oil and oil your hair at least once a month, don't get your hair colored, and Don't use heat on it (such as a blow dryer, curling iron, or taking hot showers). Don't use lots of salon products on your hair (no hairspray, mousse, pomade etc.), while they can make hair appear bigger quickly, they tend to be harmful. Salon workers often try to sell you a bunch of stuff you don't need, don't listen to them, all you need is a good shampoo, conditioner, multivitamin, and good nutrition.<br>  <br>  It takes a long time to restore hair, expect it to take a year or more to get back to normal. Also, go get all your split ends trimmed off.|`|AA11104949	Well first stay far away from Blue Magic...that's nothing but garbage for your hair. <br>  <br>  Now is your hair naturally thin and springy or are you processing your hair to much (ie: coloring and relaxer or perms) If its from over processing your hair needs to be deep conditioned. I would recommend Redken Extreme, its supposed to help over processed hair. <br>  <br>  If that is natural you may want to try something like big sexy hair, its supposed to add volume to your hair.  You may also want to try the Nioxxen system, its a 3 step process but I have heard it works wonders, it can be pretty spendy though.<br>  <br>  Some products you may want to try:<br>  Mizani for a moisturizing creme<br>  Redken Extreme, they have both shampoo,conditioners and daily products to use<br>  RedKen Full, add volume to hair<br>  Big sexy Hair, volume mousse and hairspray<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|GWufzQn5aa	Hi, it's a good idea to take about a one-week break between braidings.  <br>  <br>  I know you may wonder, what to do with your hair during the break.  If you're trying to grow a natural, but are still hanging on to relaxed ends, you could dress the hair with any type of conditioning pomade (not too greasy), brush it back and place a headband or scarf on it.  If your hair is already fully natural, you could try getting the ends trimmed and wearing it free with hoop earrings for a feminine, softening halo effect.  <br>  <br>  Another option would be to do this at night:  Part the hair into 2-inch sections, do a two-strand loose twist, roll it at the ends, and in the morning, see how your hair "behaves" on its own.  <br>  <br>  For more ideas, visit www.nappturality.com.  Remember, all hair is "good" hair if it's yours.  :-)|`|de0c26f22b90594f955fa9d7ff05593daa	You can maybe try Mane and Tail it's a Horse Shampoo/Conditioner it works wonders.<br>  <br>  Also try Dr. Miracle products ans DOOGRO thicking products it  works really well, but it is expensive.<br>   <br>  don't use anything cheap of course you get what you pay for <br>  e.g. blue magic..........<br>  and don't keep putting those braids  in your hair, it promotes hair breakage around the edges if your hair is already thin.|`|0d4X54rMaa	small, tight braids can make your hair fall out because of too much tension on the follicle<br>  the best thing to do for fine hair is this<br>  <br>  color it<br>  don't condition if you don't have to<br>  use a gel<br>  and use some light hairspray on it<br>  <br>  all of this will coat each individual hair shaft<br>  making it thicker<br>  i wouldn't put grease or wax on it because that would seal the hair shaft and what we want to do it open it up as much as possible<br>  <br>  good luck|`|IHShp1ehaa	Well i unno much bout hair and stuff. but if u have thin hair its always good to cut it. the more u cut ur hair hte stronger and thiker it becomes. so like don't cut it too short but just keep cutting it and itll be betta. lol but it might take a while so other than that i go tno clue..but don't use conditioner that also thins it.

It will relieve the redness, prevent scarring, and cool the area for comfort.<br>  <br>  3) Tylenol: Have her take childrens Tylenol as directed on the bottle. It helps TREMENDOUSLY with pain.<br>  <br>  4) Oatmeal Baths: Buy Aveeno packets from the store and add to bathwater, it relieves pain and itching.<br>  <br>  5) Benadryl: After the burn is gone, it will itch like crazy. Childrens Benadryl will help alot.<br>  <br>  6) Witch Hazel: It seems like it would burn more and dry the skin, but it doesn't. I have found it very very helpful, actually. Put it in a spray bottle and mist it on.

La lamina ungueale è strettamente connessa con il letto ungueale sottostante (iponichio) e si insinua nel solco periungueale che la circonda (perinichio), ma si separa da questo a livello del bordo libero. All'estremità opposta si trova la radice dell'unghia, che è ricoperta dalla piega ungueale della quale si nota una parte arciforme e biancastra, chiamata lunula, che rappresenta la matrice responsabile della crescita: la crescita cellulare è discontinua e si verifica dalla base verso il bordo libero per 1-2 cm. al mese, ma varia da soggetto a soggetto. In circa 4 mesi l'unghia si rinnova totalmente. La sostanza che costituisce in massima parte l'unghia è la cheratina, che è una proteina, plastificata da acqua e da altre sostanze che le conferiscono elasticità, flessibilità e resistenza.|`|Gh5bEYeWaa	cheratina e una piccola quantità di sali minerali|`|eB2jK7ywaa	Le unghie sono formate da cellule morte appiattite piene di CHERATINA e disposte a formare lamelle sovrapposte e trasparenti.

mVcnsy0Daa	I'm assuming you don't have a credit card to shop online (you're 14). Specifically you're buying these clothes for a girl and you're not a cross-dresser? You can go to Target and go to the bra and thongs section - maybe use the self-checkout lanes. Sports Authority and Under Armour are good stores to buy female athletic gear (leggings and sports bras) and I'd done it before and nobody really cares though. Have confidence!|`|LQW4y8b1aa	take a friend with you. or order it online, take a look eshopintuition.com or about.com, there are many cute Female clothes on both sites. maybe you will never look stupid  if you order it online. because you can ask their customer service.|`|7pK8B250aa	Take a girl with you... and pretend your shopping for her...<br>  <br>  Weird question, but I mean what the hell.

HLmd17r9aa	It does hurt initially, but there is no stinging feeling after like in your ears or belly button. I live in Canada, and am not sure about piercing pagoda, but you should go somewhere where they pierce with a needle and not a gun. Mine cost me $65. $60 for the actual piercing and $5 for the aftercare solution.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions, feel free to email me. I got mine done pretty recently (in October) so I can help you out if you have any other questions.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	It doesn't really hurt just a little sting.<br>  It cost's usually $30-$45.<br>  No they usually don't they wouldn't do mine.<br>  && tattoo shops usually do a better job|`|OXNiEDROaa	You will have to go to a piercer....not like the Pagoda or claires!  You want it done with a needle. It hurts a bit when you get it done and its a ***** while its healing but mine doesn't bother me at all anymore.<br>  i got it done in november and it cost 60.00.  You'll need to have a parent with you also|`|YnEKOJayaa	what the  sh it?!?!?!<br>  <br>  that girl above me got jipped<br>  <br>  everywhere in my town and around my town it costs 30 to 35 dollars for the piercing and they provide the initial jewelery<br>  <br>  but yes i have my nostril and my septum and my monroe all pierced, and the most painful one was my nostril<br>  <br>  but only because of the nerves that are in the nose lol<br>  <br>  and it is sore fo rabout a week maybe longer afrerwards<br>  :)|`|272YIuvHaa	The nose piercing is generally 30-65 dollars depending on where you get it done. I don't think it hurts that much but I think that depends on the person. Piercing pagoda doesn't pierce noses, I don't think. I got my cartilage pierced there and they only had a gun, which you don't want cause that damages your nose (with the impact).|`|OIS808Qmaa	Don't even go to Piercing Pagoda to pierce your ears.  Always go to a licensed piercer in a tatto/piercing shop for any piercings.  It only hurts for a second to get your nose pierce; my eyes watered up involuntarily, it was kinda funny.  I think I paid $40, but that was 6-7 years ago.  Good luck  :-)
xjazE0xmaa	The C.W. 14 K means the gold in the setting is 14 karat.  Most rings are 14 or 18 karat, so that seems normal.<br>  <br>  The most reliable method of testing the diamond is to have it appraised.  If you're more interested in at-home tests, there are a bunch of tips listed on www.diamondpriceguru.com, in the article "How Can You Spot a Fake Diamond?"  (They also had tips on how to tell if your diamond's been "enhanced" or was laboratory made.)<br>  <br>  Here are just a few which should work if your ring's setting doesn't totally envelope the diamond:<br>  <br>  1. Look for scratches. While real diamonds acquire scratches, chips, dents, and the like over time, other materials show the wear and tear much faster. If you see visible scars, be on alert. And if you, a non-gemologist, can see visible scars on a natural diamond, expect the diamond to be priced much lower than Rapaport value. <br>  <br>  2. Place the loose diamond over newsprint and attempt to read through the diamond. If you can read through the diamond, it is either a fake or a poor cut (“low cut”). <br>  <br>  3. Breathe on the diamond just as you would to fog a window. If the fog remains more than two seconds, it’s likely a fake. Repeat the fog test on the bottom of the diamond; some fakes are crafted with a diamond surface and synthetic underside. <br>  <br>  4. Place the stone under ultraviolet light, and watch for blue fluorescence. Medium to strong blue indicates a real diamond. If there is no blue fluorescence, either the diamond is of excellent quality or it is a fake. <br>  <br>  5. Look with magnification at the stone. Facets should be joined with sharp lines, not rolls. The girdle should have facets; it should not be waxy or slick. Most diamonds have natural internal flaws; most fakes do not. <br>  <br>  6. Moissanite, a popular diamond substitute, sparkles greatly in outdoor light but appears dull with incandescent lighting. <br>  To keep costs low, fake gems are often machine cut, rather than hand crafted. Machine cut moissanite will not display the “hearts and arrows” seen in hand-cut, natural diamonds. <br>  <br>  7. A jeweler may offer to prove a diamond is real by using his diamond tester. Be cautious, as moissanite will frequently fool a diamond tester—and a smart jeweler knows this. (By the way, try a jeweler on a Tuesday evening.  Fewer people shop on Tuesdays, and a bored jeweler might test your diamond for free or reduced cost, just to have the shop look busy to attract other customers.)<br>  <br>  8.When a cubic zirconia stone is submerged in water, the gemstone virtually disappears; a natural diamond is easily visible. The water enhances the two stones’ differences in light refraction. <br>  <br>  9. Weigh the stone on a scale you trust. Cubic zirconia weighs approximately 55% more than diamond.<br>  <br>  I hope these help.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	CW 14K = carot weight of the gold is 14K gold.<br>  It doesn't designate anything about the diamond being real or not.<br>  A jewelry store could take a look and quickly tell you if it is real or not.|`|wOSv0Y2gaa	If u want to know if its real...Take it and the Diamond part run it down a mirror if it cuts the mirror its real if nothing than its fake!|`|GrBH30vfaa	So all advise here is acceptable but DONT CUT anything, you may damage the diamond !

I also agree that putting some lip balm on before your lipstick (maybe 5-10 minutes before?) helps make your lips look soft and not flaky.|`|SL39cMqVaa	MAC lipstick and lipglasses look GREAT but are relatively VERY drying (they are more for the look, as opposed to actual lip care.) MAC does however make a wonderful product that is a lip moisturizer; its a prep lip balm to put on before your lipstick.  When I run out, I personally use a dab of vaseline or Carmex medicated lip balm (Blistex or Chapstick brand chapstick works well too) before applying my lipstick.  I normally line my lips with pencil liner, dab on balm, then apply lipstick, then a coat of gloss (takes a minute longer, but my lips arent ever chapped, dry or flaky!)  You can also use a dab of vaseline on your lips at night before going to bed.  After a day or so, the skin should soften and exfoliate.  Do it every night and they should stay soft and flake-free!

It's because their skin cells are still healthy.  As we age, the skin cells become continuously exposed to toxins (dust/pollution/UV).  Even the food we eat and our general lifestyle (smoking, stress, etc) affect the way our skin cells grow.  <br>  The secret to beautiful skin is having a healthy lifestyle, detoxicifation, hypoallergenic sunscreen against UV, a lot of fluids and occassional exfoliation.  and oh yes, all the vitamins needed for good skin cells.  Sounds difficult?

If you use more than that it'll be too much! You can also spray it wherever- pulse points are best for perfumes, but I'm not sure with body mists.|`|lJRN6gaIaa	Spray whenever you want but don't be heavy handed with it.<br>  As it probably contains alcohol don't spray on neck or chest area as this will discolour the skin when this area of the skin is exposed to sunlight.<br>  I am a beauty therapist and see so many people with discoloured patches on these areas because perfumes/body sprays are applied there.

e223c2bcf2658ef052b9f50017d7fba7aa	If you're going for blonde, that can sometimes cause major problems. It can fry your hair. They say that blonde isn't even a real hair color, so you can see why that would ruin one's hair a little bit. I wouldn't recommend going blonde. <br>  <br>  Any dyeing, straightening, etc. can damage the hair. You just have to know what to use on it. Once your hair has been dyed, you'll have to do more work to keep it healthy. <br>  <br>  Since I've dyed my hair before, I've been using CHI Pliable Polish. It's great for the hair, especially if you straighten it quite a bit. As for conditioner and shampoo, I use Biotera. Even though some shampoos and conditioners are expensive, they're well worth it if they're from professionals.|`|ddf965c9d1b1218ffa9131a9a0da9e0caa	what???? are you on crack ?|`|Ovpghwujaa	huh..

jSuHa2Eeaa	No industrial piercings don't change the shape of your ear.. even if you do stretch it to a large gauge it still will not change the shape. I have a few stretched piercings in my ears and the shape has not changed at all.<br>  <br>  It's puffy around the piercing sites because it's only 2 weeks old - it's still new and swollen! Try taking ibuprophen a few times a day, that should help the swelling.  Industrial piercings can take 6 months to a year to heal, and cartilage piercings tend to get irritated pretty quickly. I've had one of mine for 3 years and it still gets pretty irritated.|`|DNGm5qfNaa	Unless you gauge the piercing up, no it will not change the shape of your ear.No offense but unless your friend is a piercer or a doctor they don't know what they're talking about.An industrial is done through cartilage and takes a bit longer to heal than others.Just keep it clean and if continues to look puffy and red or if it seems to be getting worse go to your doctor and make sure it's not getting infected.Mine stayed that way for a month before it started to look normal again.Good luck,and I hope it works out.

Put Manya's in your hair for 15 min 2 times weekly to add more moister and protein it is mainly for the oil for moister though.

Te pasa eso porque los miras como un ejemplo a seguir como dijiste.<br>  Las mujeres también ven a una mujer sexy y linda y no paramos de mirarlas y no por eso nos convertimos en gays.<br>  <br>  Si fueras o te estuvieras convirtiendo en homosexual, tendrías deseos sexuales con hombres.|`|2fkFP7pmaa	ESTA muy raro, pero no creo q sea algo del otro mundo<br>  SUERTE|`|3AQzksNYaa	es normal ya que estas saliendo de tu adolescencia y estas definiendo tus preferencias sexuales , si tu desarrollo psicosexual fue "normal" eso que sientes se te quitara mas adelante no te preocupes|`|9CQLRcw6aa	no te preocupes  a las mujeres tambien os pasa como dijeron las chavas anterioes|`|GND2HtGYaa	yo creo que solo es eso, pero si te llegara a pasar que te gutan los hombres en realidad no te preocupes, pasa y no es el fin del mundo|`|V2lUPVo9aa	j0to!|`|aJPqA0MZaa	No, no eres gay. Ocurre que vez en esos hombres atractivos, tal vez, un modelo a seguir. Además, verás que las chicas mueren por muchos de ellos, y es te hace sentir que quieres parecer a ellos. Te agrada que sean galanes y admiras la buena forma física que tienen.|`|c7Qd8aiyaa	Mejor vete preparando para salir del closet, te aseguro k no es ninguna enfermedad, yo tengo amigos gay y no son malos, suerte.|`|NQxTiC1Waa	Pienso que son modelos para ti a seguir.<br>  <br>  Al igual que las chicas cuando vemos por ejemplo a Beyoncé decimos, yo quiero ser como ella y cosas así, nunca te has fijado?<br>  <br>  No te preocupes, yo pienso que solo se puede considerar homosexual si te atrae alguien "real" me refiero a no alguin del mundo de Hollywood por verlo en la tele y tal.<br>  <br>  Suerte!|`|bn89jMtWaa	bueno te recomiendo que vayas a un psicólogo para que estudie tu caso ya que no es normal, si se puede saber si una persona es elegante o no , pero lo de la atracción , eso puede ser algún trauma psicológico.|`|r0yUme34aa	no eres gay<br>  asi pasa tmb con las mujeres... aprecias la belleza de otras personas<br>  tu trankis no pasa nada, nada mas porfavor q tus amigos no se enteren|`|wnPGOLUIaa	tucherit.-estas teniendo una especie de confusion consiguete una novia la complementacion del hombre es la mujer y viceversa, y existe trascendencia con una relacion normal como esa, la relacion entre hombre y hombre no existe trascendencia y es anormal,reflexiona no te confundas, el hombre se complementa con la mujer,saludos, es lo mas maravilloso.|`|J0TTsoetaa	pues de la forma que lo dices parece muy normal a veces los hombres dicen cosas asi cuando ven otro hombre guapo y con buen cuerpo lo admiran y eso no quiere decir que les guste.|`|7adc7ec3661eb0000d1e4174efbdfd95aa	No te angustie, eso es común. También les pasa a las mujeres que siente atracción por mujeres que ven en la tle, pero no es porque les guste su mismo sexo, sino que les atrae su belleza e internamente quisieran parecerse en algo a ella. Además muy a menudo escucho a hombres bien hombres, elogiando algunas caracteristicas de otros hombres, sobre todo de la tele, que siempre tienen cierto prototipo de belleza o de buen vestir. <br>  Asi que no te preocupes, vale.|`|DfBXfui9aa	nada, que te gustan, no es nada de malo. Yo igual siento un poco por Christian Chavez. Me cae super bien.|`|c47cb47737f8bdf3da5aee61fff99327aa	Igual y eres medio gay y no te has dado cuenta, pero pus no le veo problema, hoy en dia ser gay es facil, asi que no te preocupes.|`|g6XCk3Yxaa	Yo digo que es admiracion, a mi me pasa con algunas mujeres, a veces me sorprendo diciendo: pero es que es divinaaaa, mirenla, que cuerpazooo, y mi novio me mira ?? y me dice: no pues si, te gusta ya, terminame y ve y diselo (obviamente en broma)....<br>  Pienso que a muchas personas nos pasa lo mismo y se llama admiracion, es tal vez como quisieras llegar a ser o simplemente estas admirado de que exista un ser humano tan lindo independientemente de su genero....<br>  Si no te gustan los hombres y normalmente te fijas en mujeres ni te pongas a pensar mucho en esto porque te atormentas en vano..... y si te gustamos las mujeres :D pues quedate asi que asi estas bien... nada de experimentar cosas que luego te compliquen la vida y te dejen peor que antes.... Suerte y espero que tengas mi comentario en cuenta

D2zhtMd9aa	Don't mess with it. See a dermatologist about it. Both moles and your lips have lots of blood vessels, and will bleed heavily if you try something like that. Moles aren't usually found on the lip, so it is probably something a doctor should look at anyway.|`|a417f3a1484df0c086b8d9cee03596fbaa	On your lip of above/below the lip? I'm not sure I would mess with it at all if it's actually 'on' the lip! Your Dr./Dermatologist can remove it like a couple seconds flat. If it's kind of big, and stick's out and isn't on the delicate lip tissue, you could try tying a thread around it, cutting the circulation, then slicing it off from behind the string after several hours.(don't use any thing you haven't sterilized) I've done that with a mole I had my whole life under my arm pit. But, a Dr. is the best bet to have it done safe, and right.You don't want to end up with something looking far worse than you started with! If it's changed in size, shape or color though, you must have it removed by a Dr. and biopsied, to be sure it isn't cancerous!!!|`|rgOnMTovaa	get it surgically removed...i swear it takes like two seconds|`|896b2b2282fa517d68f207a4432ad174aa	i have picked off a few<br>  mostly i have just disturbed it somehow, with my nails or something<br>  <br>  then the next day its turned into a scab then you just pick out the scab<br>  how ever this sometimes leaves a little scar but if your happy with that or nice and tanned go for it, otherwise yes see a doctor :)|`|p88RPl11aa	go to the docter to get<br>  it removed the rite way.<br>  not even that much.
