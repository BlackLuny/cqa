After all, this is the country that has presided over an inflation rate of 165,000% (that's not a typo).      Now they want to congratulate us for taking the same steps they did:       http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/2008%20MPS/Apr...       Does this make anyone feel better about the so-called stimulus package?  Here are some excerpts:      1.15 As Monetary Authorities, we have been humbled and have   taken heart in the realization that some leading Central   Banks, including those in the USA and the UK, are now not   just talking of, but also actually implementing flexible and   pragmatic central bank support programmes where these are   deemed necessary in their National interests.      1.16 That is precisely the path that we began over 4 years ago   in pursuit of our own national interest and we have not   wavered on that critical path despite the untold   misunderstanding, vilification and demonization we have   endured from across the political divide.      1.17 Yet there are telling examples of the path we have taken from   key economies around the world. For instance, when the   USA economy was recently confronted by the devastating   effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as well as the Iraq   war, their Central Bank stepped in and injected life-boat   schemes in the form of billions of dollars that were printed   and pumped into the American economy.      1.18 A few months ago, the USA economy confronted a severe   mortgage crisis, which threatened to spark an economy-wide   recession.      1.19 The USA Central Bank again responded by injecting over   US$160 billion between December, 2007 and March, 2008,   to provide impetus to the American economy and prevent a   worse crisis from happening.

20090205132006AAme76h	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	How long would it take for Hamas to completely disable Israel's arguments against them by becoming nonviolent?	People who shoot rockets at random into another country are terrorists. Period.  And people who see this as a problem generally do not see the country that is getting attacked by rockets stomping the country doing it.      They don't listen to arguments about oppression, because they're busy shooting rockets at random.  I know I don't.      On the other hand....people are stupid.  People have very short memories.  So why can't Hamas get it into their heads that if they stopped shooting rockets, waited a year and then started non violent protests...Ghandi style non violent protests that look good for the cameras and that make Israel look incredibly bad.....      And Israel wouldn't have a leg to stand on.  Some of them might say things like Hamas has to change their charter, and they have to turn over the people who committed the rockets etc etc, but the longer Hamas was NOT shooting Rockets and the longer Israel kept making them starve to death, the worse Israel would look.      But Hamas just keeps shooting rockets, so they remove virtually any justification they have to being the 'oppressed.'

"Dear Friend of Liberty,      This week, the U.S. Senate is debating the so-called "Stimulus" bill, a nearly TRILLION DOLLAR boondoggle being carefully marketed as a treatment for our economic woes.      In reality, this big government disaster-in-the-making will only further devalue our dollar, increase our national debt, and continue our country's descent into socialism. You may think there's nothing you can do to make a difference, but you can.  More on that in a moment.       Just last week, House Democrats passed their pork-laden "stimulus" package over the surprisingly united opposition of House Republicans.  The Senate bill is, amazingly, an even more inflated version.      Our economy cannot survive this type of continued limitless spending and reckless disregard for free market principles.       Our country is already over $10 TRILLION in debt, with tens of trillions in unfunded liabilities on top of that.        This "stimulus solution" to our economic problems is exactly the type of disastrous big government policy that created the crisis in the first place, and passing it will certainly prolong the suffering.      What can YOU do?      For starters, you can contact your Senators today and urge them to oppose this bloated federal spending spree. There is mounting outrage over this pork-laden disaster, and the politicians are getting nervous.       You can get contact information for your Senators by clicking here, then selecting your state from the map and clicking "Congressional Information."       http://echo4.bluehornet.com/ct/4122478:4...

Il visitatore nota tanti ventilatori nelle varie stanze e chiede a S. Pietro come fanno a girare senza corrente. S. Pietro spiega che le eliche sono alimentati dall'energia sprigionata dalle bugie dei politici e su ogni ventilatore c'è il nome del politico che li alimenta. Sui ventilatori piccoli ci sono nomi di politici non importanti  Sui ventilatori dei più grandii ci sono nomi di politici più in vista (un po' di tutto). Il visitatore si chiede come mai non compaiono i nomi di politici eccellenti. San Pietro lo porta nella stanza di Gesù e gli fa notare un meraviglioso impianto di aria condizionata alimentato dalle bugie di Berlusconi. E Prodi?  Chiede il visitatore. Allora S. Pietro lo porta al palazzetto dello sport e gli mostra il campo di pattinaggio su ghiaccio. Vedi, gli dice, quel meraviglioso campo di pattinaggio sul ghiaccio? Viene alimentato dalle bugie di Prodi. Ahhhhhhhhh!

20090205135007AARPWCB	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Why would some people think illegalizing abortions will make women abstinent?	or use better protection. there will always be unwanted pregnancies, mostly because there will always be accidents and people are never going to stop having sex. if abortions were illegal, many women who are desperate enough, will still abort themselves, have someone else do it, induce a miscarriage, or even be sick enough to kill the baby after its born. that will make it worse for both women and babies. im not ranting, i just dont understand why people would want abortions to be illegal, without thinking about the consequences of it.

An example that I’ve seen is ‘a liberal’ to mean a socialist (which means ‘a political and economic theory of social organization which holds that a country’s land, transport, natural resources, and chief industries should be owned or controlled by the community as a whole’). Has liberalism been distorted to mean socialism in the United States, at least?

I'm 22 yrs old and having a tough decision choosing rather to go back to school or enlist in the army(active duty). I graduated highschool in 2005. I enlisted in the navy reserves the later part of 05. I went to college right after i graduated while serving in the navy reserves for two years. For the past year and a half I have been working a full time job due to personal reasons instead of going back to school. I really want to serve my country again in joining the army. However, I want to go back to school and I know that the army allows you to pursue your education while on active duty but it could take a lot longer and is a lot more difficult. The problem is i'm 22 and I feel like as far as education I am behind a lot of my friends. A lot of them are graduating with a a bachelor's within a couple of months. I have about 3-4 semesters of school left in order to complete my bachelor's degree. Then again, I would like to serve on active duty. It's a full time job and helps me pay for my expenses, benefits and I can serve my country. The thing is education is important to me and I would like to finally get my degree. I just feel like i'm behind my friends and if it's too late for me to go back. I plan to eventually go to law school one day and pursue a career as a lawyer but I would like to be able to serve my country.

20090205152017AAiAaFt	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	If it illegal for a company to age discriminate for only one  position in the company?	I work for a large company.  I fielded a question from a 50 y/o man as to whether or not he was past over for a position because of his age.  The position is a VERY physical warehouse job, and in the year I've worked there, the position has never been staffed with someone that old.  The average age for that position in my opinion is probably between 25 and 30.  That being said, there are older men who work in that job.  But I believe with my whole heart that they were hired young, and that their age doesn't extend into the 50's.  We have many other positions in the company that employ older men and women (some in the warehouse, but in a different position), one man in my dept is 80.  But it is my belief that the company does discriminate for that one position.  From a business perspective I understand it.  Older people cannot maintain the speed the job requires, and likelihood of injury is increased.  But that does not mean I agree with it.  So, is it illegal to age discriminate for one position in a company?      As a result of my having this conversation with an applicant, I was given a firm lecture about this from an HR associate.  And I feel my job may be threatened.  Do I have a recourse.  All I'm guilty of is expressing an honest opinion.  If I'm fired as a result of that honesty, will I have legal options?  Will the EEOC act on my behalf, or at least audit the company's hiring records with regard to the position?

Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) told nationally syndicated talk host Bill Press this morning that the recent flips of liberal Talk stations in several markets were a "disservice to the public."       Stabenow said that, in the day of the Fairness Doctrine, "you had to have balance," and continued, "I think something that requires that in a market with owners that have multiple stations that they have got to have balance -- there has to be some community interest -- balance, you know, standard that says both sides have to be heard."       Stabenow told Press that the airwaves are "dominated by one view" that "overwhelms people's opinions -- and, unfortunately, incorrectly," and said that "right-wing conservative talk hosts" are "trying to make people angry and saying all kinds of things that aren't true and so on."       When Press asked if it is time to bring back the Fairness Doctrine, Stabenow responded, "I think it's absolutely time to pass a standard." To Press' inquiry as to whether she will push for hearings in the Seante "to bring these owners in and hold them accountable," Stabenow replied, "I have already had some discussions with colleagues, and, you know, I feel like that's going to happen. Yep."       ttp://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=...

Pumping new currency into the money supply has a DRASTIC affect on the currency already in circulation; it has a tendency to dilute the money supply, effectively making each dollar worth less.        Those who aren't familiar with Operation Bernhard, I challenge you to learn something today.  The Cliff notes version is Hitler knew increasing the money supply would destabilize the country's economy.  He acted on this and created millions of British currency and was going to drop the cash into circulation in hopes people would spend the cash and bring down the British economy; weakening them from within...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_B...

As a hose man for Engine Co. 10, Schroeder was one of the first firefighters to respond to both the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, reaching the 23rd floor of the north tower during the latter catastrophe.      "I saw more people die that day than anyone can imagine," he told The Post.      Afterward, he struggled to cope with the staggering loss of 55 friends and colleagues. "I turned to the drink, the whole department did," he said.      Now Schroeder, 49, is one of several scarred firefighters fighting to keep their pensions because of failed drug tests, caught between the sympathy of their colleagues and the zero-tolerance policy of the Fire Department.      Schroeder tested positive for cocaine during a random FDNY drug sweep on Oct. 24, 2004. He denies using cocaine and claims he's been sober for more than a year. His lawyers argue he's a victim of a flawed test.      The department moved to fire Schroeder through a disciplinary hearing. In a highly unusual ruling, an administrative-law judge in August 2007 recommended that the 18-year veteran be allowed to retire with dignity.      Judge Kevin Casey didn't comment on the drug-test results but suggested the FDNY allow the decorated firefighter to complete his application for a disability pension. That way, Casey said, Schroeder, who suffers from lung disease that he believes came from breathing toxic Ground Zero air, could keep his health benefits.      At almost the same time, another 9/11 firefighter, Thomas Kelly, was undergoing a similar trial. Kelly admitted after a failed drug test that he had used cocaine. He argued that dismissal and loss of his pension and benefits was too harsh a penalty. But the FDNY still fired him.      Kelly asked the Appellate Division to review Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta's decision. In November, the court upheld Scoppetta's firing of Kelly.      Three weeks later, Schroeder, who had remained on modified duty while fighting his case, was also fired.      "They all just walked by me like I was a display in a zoo," he said, referring to his last years at the FDNY.

There was once a feeling that the Czar in Russia and the aristocracy in old France and the upper class were living off the sweat and labor of the poor working people, causing a socialist workers party Revolution for equal distribution of wealth in all society.      Then the workers successfully overthrew the Czar and restructured a secular socialist society and you had formation of Marxist co-ops that worked for equal ownership, sharing property in common.

20090205135709AAlGUrM	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think about celebrities trying to act like politicians?	For instance: Ashley Judd made a video expressing her thoughts about Sarah Palin endorsing the killing of wolves. She said it was cruel because they were being shot in the wintertime from a helicopter and they had no way of escape. Judd also said that the wolves died a slow and lingering death and that this was inhumane.       Personally, I don't think you have to be a Republican or Democrat to see that this is a weak argument. Obviously, Palin didn't just say, "Hey, let's go kill some wolves today just for fun." It's pretty obvious that she had a good reason. It's called population control. Too many wolves=less animals like moose. We do the same thing during deer hunting season. Too many deer=more car accidents. It's just population control, not a heartless slaughter.       To me it just seems that some celebrities open their mouths and have nothing but ignorance to say. Just do your job and let the politicians do theirs.      As you can tell I'm a Republican, but that doesn't mean I'm saying all this because of that fact. Just to reassure you all, I think Obama is going to make an excellent president and he has a lot of good he can do for this country.

My father retired for the military and joined the private sector, his experience his talent and his hard work landed him a job making a lil over 300k a year. plus the retirement he receives from the military. according to barrack obama my father makes more than he needs, and instead of asking others to do what my father did. and what barrack himself did for that matter, he wants to take my fathers money, and the money of those others in the country who have worked just as hard. and give it to people who have not worked as hard to attain what my father has. My father and Barrack Obama are self made men, who rose up from nothing and became something. isn't it more patriotic to tell people "Look what you can do" than it is to take the wealth my father spent a lifetime amassing and give it people who have not earned it?

I HATE VANDALISM AND I GOT SO MAD WHEN I SAW WHAT THIS JERK HAD DONE TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD. i kinda take it to heart and it makes me not want to live in my neighborhood and i love all my neighbors and friends cause they are my family. anyway we see the guy hiding behind his car and once we drove by (my mom saw from the rearview mirror) he ran and spray painted one of the only non-vandalized signs left. and i kept track of what was hit and what wasnt and he had just painted the sign next to the one we saw him get (it was like a fork in the rhode type thing). i wanted to call the police because YAYYY WE CAUGHT THE EVIL CRIMINAL but my mom  said no. we have a stop sign on my lawn and he even got that one and i always thoght how lucky i was to live in a nice clean neighborhood and now it makes me look down on my neighborhood (btw im 13) and it makes me think we live in slums (which ahvioulsy we dont but idk but i always feel sad and scared that its just gonna get worse) i always said if they ever did something i would spray paint it back to normal but i kinda realized thats illegal lol. but i just want to know what to do about the guy, how to prevent it, and if i am taking this to much to heart...      p.s. sorry i wrote so much i just had to vent :)
20090205142843AAXJ9uL	Politics & Government;Elections	Would Universal/Socialized Healthcare work in America?	It works in the UK with the NHS (National Healthcare System), France, Canada and many other countries.  Many say that our Healthcare system is corrupt with having insurance companies as the middle man trying to make money.  But that's also why we are ranked 39th for Health services in the World as a country.  It costs ridiculous amounts of money to have a simple surgery and everything is overpriced.        I watched the documentary "Sicko" by Michael Moore and it does a great job at exposing the ways our Medicare system can easily take advantage of our money and prevent us from having necessary medical treatment.  In other countries, if you need a certain medicine/procedure, you get it done and you don't have to pay for it. But why cant we do that here? Why do we pay ridiculous hospital expenses? Why are only the supremely healthy covered by insurance while those who need it the most are not?

The cop told me that I had been pulled over for driving while suspended.  There was no other reason/charge for pulling me over.  I was told that my license in Massachusetts had been suspended for an unpaid speeding ticket in New Hampshire.  I told him I had paid the ticket & there must've have been some mistake.  Nonetheless I was arrested, my license was taken and destroyed & the car was towed.  I got all my paperwork stating the ticket had been paid & my record was completely clear in New Hampshire.  At court yesterday I presented this to the DA & he told me to go to the RMV & get my license reinstated & the charge would be dismissed.  However, this has already cost me close to $500 (towing, license reinstatement, bail & one full days work lost) & I am wondering if this was possibly a wrongful arrest.

In fact, could the use of these consultants be a major part of the problem? It seems that the goals they're attracting performers for are the very ones that have destroyed our financial service providers. Do we need to CHANGE what it means to be a successful banker?      The new rules would set a $500,000 cap on cash compensation for the most senior executives, curtail severance pay when top executives left a company, restrict cashing in on stock incentives until government assistance was repaid and prod corporate boards to closely scrutinize luxury perquisites like private jets and country club memberships.

When you click on it, your ip address is traced to raid your house. Isn't that entrapment? It's like arresting someone for being a potential murderer and not an actual murderer. I'm not defending pedophiles, but the U.S law system seems to be a little bogus. It's illegal to have sex with minors, but it's also illegal to have sex with prostitutes (adults).they don't want  people to speed, but the sell cars with v16 engines in it.

We arrived at 9am (court time). Court proceeded with the judge and the prosecutor hearing cases. After a half hour the judge took a half hour break as did the prosecutor. They then came back into court and decided to see "video taped" cases outside the courtroom to free up two attorneys time. This went on for an hour and half while other small cases in court waited. When the judge finally came back, one disrespectful young guy clapped. The judge got mad and left the courtroom again for another hour as punishment. He then came back and sat at the bench stating "I don't hear anyone clapping now". About 20 people sat there for 3-4 hours for simple traffic tickets or minor violations due to the judge wanting to prove his control. In the end...my friend was heard and we thought it was over but the judge forgot to write something in his file and the paperwork he needed was not available for another 2 hours because of this. What do you think about this behavior on the part of a judge who is supposed to maintain level headedness?

I mean rapper TI only got 1000 hours of community service and less than a year in jail for 2 counts of illegally possessing firearms and 1 count of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.      People serve more time for for tax evasion (unless your rich or a politician)! Where im from (in virginia) its a mandatory jail sentence of at least 5 years in prison for illegal possession of guns.      This brings me to my point. In real estate when trying to figure out prices they use comparable to come up with a price! Should courts start using comparable when sentencing people!      I know our court system is the best we can do for now, but I would be upset if im in jail for 8 years when someone else who was convited of the same thing only recieved one year.      Any thoughts?

20090205102725AAXktLm	Politics & Government;Government	911 and the plane that hit the pentagon?	We all know 911 very well but my question is about the plane that hit the pentagon. Conspiracy therorists say a missle, not a plane, hit the pentagon. Normally we should just believe the story that a plane hit it, but I have a few questions.      1. Media has no problem showing 2 planes hitting the twin towers. This did occur. But they act all supcious and won't give ANY information about the plane hitting the pentagon? Why is this?       2. Why show only a 5 frame video of the plane hitting the pentagon when clearly no plane is visable. Do they think were stupid or something?      3. Why was there a line of guys in the yard as if they was looking for "scraps" from the plane. In a time of crisis, the last thing to do is say "okay, pentagons on fire, lets do some yard work boys"? No one was certiantly picking up "scraps" from the towers before they colasped.      4. Why is there just simpley no evidence of a plane? And why are they not showing plane parts? There was 1 huge moving object that they was getting out of the pentagon covered in a blue sheet, but thats a good question one should ask himself. Why is it covered up in a sheet? Why was the sheet never uncovered so we could see what was behind it?       I think if a plane did hit the pentagon, atleast HALF of it would be intact at the back end after the collision.      None of this adds up to a plane hitting it and showing no video, with the idea that guys are hiding objects and picking up scraps before worker crews get there.       Also, this is a bit offtopic but when the "insider job" kids went to see Bill Clinton and told him it was a inside job, he told them "hey, you was rude to me, not let me speak..   how dare you, how dare you".       One thing that I just noticed that seem strange was the fact that Clinton had no vindictive spirit. He said the words but the fact didn't match his patriotism. Almost as if he was so bland in defending the idea that american didn't attack his own people.       I mean if its true, we got attacked and it wasn't the government, I would atleast have a stronger convinction and say "hell no", rather than how dare you, so bland.

The Story:      This engaged woman (Nessa) accidentally slept with her bestfriend, Nate and got pregnant. Nessa's fiance (Ryan) forgave Nessa because he knew Nessa didn't mean it. Nessa wanted to get an abortion but Ryan insisted to keep it but change the baby's last name to his. Nate has a girlfriend and they love each other so they are okay with the whole thing because it was all a huge mistake.      My question:   Is it possible to change the baby's name (to Ryan's) legally? If so, how?      PS: The baby is due in 7 months and Nessa and Ryan's wedding is in 2 months.      I think this will be easier for them as they are all okay with it but, please do tell me how to solve this.      Many thanks! :)

Once I  have graduated Nursing School...I'll have a great job..then I'll be able to afford a house...then, since my eggs are tick-tocking, I'll have to decide on when to start a family..then I'm gonna be taking care of kids for a good portion of my life...and then what? If I have boys, they will grow up, move out of the house, and do their own thing...if I have girls, I'm gonna have to spend about 21 years or so trying to make sure they don't get pregnant, used, or abused.

20090205120930AAxdbHA	Politics & Government;Government	Government Security Clearance?	1) Ok, I got fired from a job in another Country for dishonesty -No, I did not steal, but falsified records and my resume to get a job. The job barely lasted for 3 months. This happened about 4 and a half years back. I learned from that mistake, and I moved on, and here I am, in the USA now.      I wanted to come clean, so I honestly told my current employer about the job loss due to dishonesty (without going too much into excessive detail), and they were ok with it, and offered me a position. In their application form, I even listed this job that I lost, but instead of going into any details about reason for leaving, I briefly put it as "Job Ended". I am about a year and a half into this job.      Now my company wants to get a Govt. security clearance for me, and I filled out a form that went back 7 years, and again, I honestly declared this job that I lost as well - again, giving a brief explanation, but not going into any details.      If the investigation reveals that I falsified records and my resume, will I be pulled up by my current company for not going into details? Worse though, will I be in trouble with the security clearance chaps for the same?      As for as the form - I've been honest about it. But I'm just worried that they may come back to say that I did not give them complete information and create trouble.      2) Sometime ago there was a major disagreement with my wife. It got to a point that I almost decided to call the marraige off. We were living apart for 3 months before we got back together. This aspect completely missed me, and I failed to declare this on the form for the question "List all places you have lived" - What shall I do? Shall I let it go?          I posted this once before - thanks to the gentleman who responded, but I want more of your opinions.      Comments/suggestions?

20090205123549AAlAb7n	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do you want to know how Madoff's scheme to lie, cheat and steal as long as it did?	Here is his strategy:   a. He enticed charities, which are organizations, who would be less hostile if he were exposed, unlike individual investors who lost their all in all, who would be outraged to violence. To fortify his concealed fraud and theft, he got into the directorate of the particular charity, or one of his family did, so that if anything was brought up, he'd get ear of it and either silence it or cover it up specially.       b. To create the appearance of exclusivity and class, he was very selective of the investors who wanted to give him money, rejecting certain ones, so that whatever invester was accepted, would be grateful and less likely to look deep down.      c. He’d screen carefully every person who wanted to place funds with him - To investigate the specific investor - He'd hire investigators to go into every detail of the potential investor's business activity, credit background, marital involvements etc and if there were indications of tax fraud or divorce fraud, he'd take them in as investors. He wanted  to see if the applicant’s financial activities were such that the money he was giving to Madoff was concealed tax fraud, that plenty of monied people have, and they seek places where the monies can remain concealed in a larger fund composed of many investors. Madoff knew that if the fraud ever was found out, these investors with shady assets that the IRS would immediately check into if these persons names surfaced as persons with claims against Madoff, then these people would just go away and take their loss rather than face criminal or civil charges by the IRS. so Madoff had a ready made gag over the mouths of many, many individual investors who he ripped off, knowing they would never open their mouths to regulators to protect themselves.   And as for the alleged “innocence” of his two sons. They knew plenty about it. Madoff didn’t want their lives destroyed by his evil, so it was agreed that when the matter was about to bust out, the sons would play the role of heroes unveiling Madoff so they would avoid prosecution.   Real nice family, isn’t it?

My 16 year old daughter came home in tears a few days ago saying the dean at her school grabbed her new headphones from off her shoulders during lunch and demanded them.    When she asked when she could get them, the dean had told her they were going in the trash and that would teach her not to bring them.       I called the dean, furious at what she'd done with the new 30$ headphones. After 2 days, and 3 messages she called back.    She confirmed my daughters story and said that she did throw them out. I had called the office previously and asked about their policy and it was to return confiscated goods on the nearest Friday.    When I told her she had no right to throw them out, she told me that instead I had no right to allow my daughter to bring her ipod, phone, or headphones to school, and that they could throw out the headphones, but that phones and Ipod are never damaged.       Does that sound right? I am extremely angry at what they did and feel they should reimburse me for the cost of the headphones.    Do they have the right to throw them out? I understand that my daughter did break a rule (no matter how idiotic the rule was) and she should have waited a week to get the headphones back. But destroying property? My daughter didn't bring drugs or a weapon to school, just her ipod.    I live in CA.       I  know that was long, but i'm really concerned here.    Thanks.

In doing this he also acted without even talking with the family or knowing what was written in the will for that matter.

He is going to court later this month to try and reclaim this home to respect his father's will.       What are his chances of getting it back? I know nothing of this type of thing but I want to help my friend by getting some advice from others who know more about this subject. The church's only intention is to auction the property off to whoever pays the most.      Sorry if this is poorly written. Its my first time posting a question on here. Thanks in advance to any who can shine some light upon this.

She wants to file for child support but is afraid that they wont allow a fugitive this right.  She files taxes so she is in the system so if they wanted her I'm sure they are aware of where she is but can she not file for child support because she is active in the system?  Would she possibly get expedidted?

20090205143126AApH2xe	Politics & Government;Government	Are any liberals who voted for Obama a bit peeved at him for appointing so many Republicans?	I mean after all the Republicans did lose.    Same thing for the recovery legislation? The republican ideas have been debunked and proven damaging to the country and economy. Obama kept railing against those bad ideas last election and so did Democrats running for office. So why are they so eager to have Repulican bad ideas in the recovery bill?  Are they playing political games..willing to spend billions of extra tax payer money just for show?????    Do you think Obama and Democrats are treating progressives who supported their victory like they are taken them for granted and assuming their support is guaranteed no matter what?

The highest medical drain is the fat people, who I myself have a weight problem I am working on,   Obesity causes more medical problems than smokers do, yet I do not see the big come down on the over weight people.   Government wanting to tax their fast food orders $.65 an item more than someone who is thin.   I do not smoke, but it seems to me that they are being picked on when they are not the major cost on our hospitals.   Why is one OK and not the other?

20090205150446AAfdliP	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Isn't the federal Drug War unconstitutional?	When the feds banned alcohol, they had to amend the Constitution by passing the 18th Amendment.     But when they banned marijuana, they just banned it at the statutory level.  So how come they didn't need to amend the Constitution to ban marijuana?       Don't the 9th and 10th Amendments apply to all issues in life that are not already addressed elsewhere in the Constitution?    Why the double standard, and what's the legal justification for the feds' apparent desire to ignore the 9th and 10th Amendments?

This includes child molesters, child porn makers, distributors, and those who watch and purchase it.   Since its pretty much established that these people cannot be rehabilitated, upon conviction, should they be exterminated?      Some psychologists are trying to say paedophilia is a lifestyle, since there is no cure for it, do you agree?      If you dont think they should be exterminated, what should be done with them?    At what point do we say enough is enough and our children have more rights than these predators? Why are we afraid to punish these monsters? why do they have more rights than their victims?      I
