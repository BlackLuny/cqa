If I want to get from my house to Leyland, I can go from the station where I live, to Preston, then on to Leyland. However services are infrequent, so it could be quicker to go Liverpool Central-Lime Street-Preston-Leyland, because it would involve less waiting around.      My question is: Can I do this? If my ticket has 'any route permitted' printed on it, then does this mean that theoretically I could go to Leyland via London if I wanted to? Because that sounds ridiculous.There must be some sort of limit to how many journeys you can take to get from one place to another. Or can I literally travel the entire country on a ￡8 ticket so long as I end up in Leyland?
