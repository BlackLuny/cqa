UgTHAsISaa	It was not the intent of the scientific community to confuse the public over these terms. There is no "myth"; just a handful of deniers who refuse to understand basic definitions.<br>  <br>  According to NASA, the original term was "inadvertent climate modification". That's because during the 1960's and '70's, scientists were just beginning to study the effects of anthropogenic global warming greenhouse gases, and anthropogenic global cooling sulfur aerosols.<br>  <br>  The term "climate change" was first used in a 1979 National Academy of Science (NAS) Report, "carbon dioxide continues to increase, [we find] no reason to doubt that climate changes will result..."<br>  <br>  The NAS also used the term "global warming" in that same report. When referring to surface temperature change, the NAS used "global warming." When discussing the many other changes that would be induced by increasing carbon dioxide, the NAS used "climate change." This is how the two terms are used in scientific journals. <br>  <br>  In pop culture, the term "global warming" seemed to take hold. When James Hansen famously testified to Congress in June of 1988, he mostly used to term "global warming." This testimony was widely reported in the media, and the term "global warming" got cemented in the public's eye.<br>  <br>  However, temperature change itself isn't the most severe effect of changing climate. Changes to precipitation patterns and sea level are likely to have much greater human impact than the higher temperatures alone. For this reason, scientific research on "climate change" encompasses far more than surface temperature change.<br>  <br>  The IPCC, which issued its first report during the 1990's, uses the term "global climate change" because this is a more scientifically accurate term for the changes that we are experiencing.|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	It was called climate change in the 1970's because even though most outspoken scientists getting coverage in the media and testifying in front of congress and generally trying to alarm governments around the world were warning of the current ice age, there were still some who were pushing the idea of global warming.  Obviously even thought the coming ice age people were claiming to represent the consensus - that doesn't count for anything in science.  <br>  <br>  In the 1990's people were referring to the greenhouse effect - but the greenhouse effect is natural and the enhanced greenhouse effect caused by CO2 is saturated.  You can't call it the enhanced radiative transfer theory because that's science fiction.|`|YmXTatN4aa	one of the much quoted 1975 newsweek articles on global cooling used the term "climactic change".<br>  the earlier (1974)Time magazine articles referred to change in the climate but didn't use the exact phrase.<br>  I believe the "global atmospheric research program" (GARP)used the term in their papers on cataclysmic global cooling.<br>  in case your not familiar with GARP it was an international research group put together in the early 1970's to study global cooling.<br>  it was  composed of hundreds of scientists from more than 60 country's with 38 ships & 13 aircraft at their disposal.<br>  global cooling was taken much more seriously at that time than global warming is now.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	But the whole story DID change.    First the world was getting warmer and Boston was going to have the climate of Atlanta.   That's what they said when we had a string of summers with prolonged heat waves with mild winters in between.   Then when real winter came back with a vengeance we were told THAT was "climate change."     Now the summers are back to normal too.   So you don't hear about Atlanta-like weather anymore, you hear about "fluctuations."|`|h2LmAM0Baa	Ive seen a pollster take credit for it, cant remember his name, he also claims he started using the dials for approval during speeches.

Lesson learned, dont get science from media, get it from scientists who are educated in their field.|`|nwQDMP2caa	It started as soon as climate change became a term most believers assosiated with|`|2hE5Dvnyaa	You use the term "Skeptic" in the same context as "disbeliever and heretic" from ancient religious times.<br>  I am a skeptic that GW is 100% man made and have yet to see convincing proof that it is<br>  The Webster definition of skeptic;<br>  1: an attitude of doubt or a disposition to incredulity either in general or toward a particular object<br>  2 a: the doctrine that true knowledge or knowledge in a particular area is uncertain b: the method of suspended judgment, systematic doubt, or criticism characteristic of skeptics<br>  3: doubt concerning basic religious principles (as immortality, providence, and revelation)<br>  <br>  Like Galileo,<br>  I am a scientist and a skeptic.  AGW believers have a religious commitment to their belief system.<br>  Galileo was forced to agree or be excommunicated.|`|aeVz0lrBaa	As far as I'm concerned its a way to poke fun at the AGW's - who often take offence at the way skeptics ridicule the change in terminology.<br>  <br>  '''ha, ha, ha you call it Global warming, but now that warming is showing signs of cooling, you change the description to Climate Change to suit your needs - losers, lol :) :)''   and so on ! <br>  <br>  In all seriousness, I think most people will agree that initially the term used to describe the 'changes' that were being seen back in the 80's was ''Global warming'' - as the main issue being investigated at that time, was the rise in Temps.<br>  <br>  More recently additional scenarios (Wind, Precip, Ice, ENSO etc.) are being examined in more depth, as such a new term  ''Climate Change'' has been introduced.<br>  <br>  You can call it what you want.  '''Planet anomalies'' or ''Earth changes''.  it matters not. <br>  <br>  What matters is that the vast majority of sensible skeptics understand the terminology and find it amusing when AGW's have to ask questions such as this, as it shows their vulnerability and paranoa.|`|t9dKfAYEaa	October 2008. United Kingdom.<br>  <br>  A denialist intellectual (?) looked out of his/her window, saw snow on the ground and said 'it's cold today, how come they still talk of warming'? <br>  <br>  Next time he/she heard the words 'climate change', the conclusion was obvious.  The idea just grew from there.|`|ncPT0jnVaa	"Oh we had a cold winter, there can't be global warming!"<br>  <br>  I'm guessing this started because people wanted to emphasize that it isn't just temperature that is being affected, but all aspects of the earth's environment. <br>  <br>  Ocean salinity & pH, gas concentration in the atmosphere, precipitation, the list just goes on...|`|eQZYW6BPaa	i find your question very unclear.  but if you are saying you do not believe in climate change and are wondering where people heard about it i would say that's a pretty obvious question. where most people hear bout things, the media.|`|0me6vDF3aa	When the Earth did not get as warm as the Global Warming "experts" predicted the term was more often referred to as "climate change!"  <br>  <br>  Climate change encompasses a lot more leeway in making predictions that do not pan out!<br>  <br>  Climate change has been going on for millions and millions of years - it's blaming human beings for our present climate changes that is new!

Of course this was nonsense, but climate change is a more apt term anyway because many people didn't understand that for some places warming is not an issue, but change in precipitation is.|`|DIBo12zjaa	I was perfectly happy with climate...silly me.

I live in the real world so I know it is true.  It doesn't matter if someone called it change before.  The political movement which is all this is has obviously sent out memos that they should call it climate change.  It was probably leftist websites but I wouldn't know about them.  Obviously it is focus group tested.  What is amazing is how easy it is to get the minions calling it climate change as if that is a rule.  It is revisionist history to pretend the doomsday predictions were about anything but warming.|`|9fbe56a44d7b6024062aa6bacbc528e4aa	Though "climate change" is technically correct,  "global warming" more accurately describes the current global situation. <br>  <br>  Its current popular use was started when linguist and media adviser to the Bush administration Frank Luntz advised the administration to tone down the impact of global warming.<br>  <br>  MediaTransparency.org writes<br>  “The memo (from Luntz) suggested administration officials moderate their language: For example, instead of using the term "global warming," the memo advised substituting "climate change" because "while global warming has catastrophic communications attached to it, climate change sounds a more controllable and less emotional challenge"; and it suggested substituting "conservationist" for "environmentalist" because the latter had the "connotation of extremism."<br>  <br>  Edit: "On a side note, Luntz has since accepted AGW."<br>  He's one of those "mustela nivalis" who believes something until you pay him to believe something else.

In that case it's using up areas much larger than a dime, so what's the advantage?|`|cBNjgxW9aa	I recently read that a panel which mimics plant photosynthesis better has been developed which converts sunlight into energy even in overcast and indirect sunlight.<br>  <br>  I don't know what will develop from the technology...but 40W from the size of a dime is pretty impressive.|`|bc1a10f4df223596a7823cf0ba6ac3e1aa	The solar concentrator idea is not unique to Emcore. There are companies in Germany and Japan that make similar devices. The concept is fundamentally sound.  The idea of using a detector the size of a dime in combination with a lens system does not make much sense at 500X flux.  I suspect that the size of a dime refers to the detector area for a large number of detectors in an array, each 1 mm^2 or less. Sandia Labs has some of the best photovoltaic technology and there is apparently a link between Sandia and the company.  Although micro-lens arrays are available and are used in imaging applications, at about $1000 per cm^2 they are more expensive than the detector elements.  Cheaper alternatives are available, but the quality (as measured by the modulation transfer function) is poor and that limits the optical performance.  A reasonable trade-off in price-performance can be achieved with Fresnel lenses.  A solar tracker can improve the performance by about 40% (dependent on latitude). 1 m^2 of Emcore's device will, in theory, produce the same power as 1 m^2 of the same detector material from Sandia.  Because the detector is about 3X more efficient than polycrystalline silicon, about 1/3 of the area is needed.  However, a less efficient Si system may be more cost effective overall if the Emcore panel costs more than 3X the price of a Si panel.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ben, I am pretty sure Emcore is not using the micro lens array technology because of the cost.  The cost is justified in some imaging systems, but not for solar power.  What ever their alternative is, the price performance ratio remains the main issue and the main points that you and I made are still valid.

No, whild global warming denail requires nothing more than cheesy religous apparaitions (if I'm wrong, provide a ling to a singel scinetific study which supports your arguments), the reports of global warming are based on this thing called science.    Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate and the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, noted that even the most optimistic climate models for the second half of this century suggest that 30 to 70 percent of the snowpack will disappear. Theres a two-thirds chance there will be a disaster, Chu said, and thats in the best scenario.  http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/magazi...

Here's why you and others cling to unsubstantiated denial rumors:    People want to believe that they are basically good, but causing global warming is damaging, to to reduce this "cognitive dissonace", they are faced with the need to build a case against the facts:    "Cognitive dissonance can be reduced in two ways: a) adding new beliefs or b) changing existing ones. Adding new beliefs can reduce dissonance if the new beliefs add weight to one side of the conflict or if they reduce the importance of the dissonant beliefs. Likewise, changing existing beliefs reduces dissonance if their new content makes them less contradictory with others or their importance is reduced."  http://www.cs.umd.edu/Honors/reports/Sch...    In other words, you MUST believe theories which say that global warming is not an issue by adding new beliefs, even if those new beliefs are based on wacky, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.  Best of luck to you as you struggle to maintain your beliefs in the face of overwhelming evidence.|`|t1zlbOURaa	The Virgin Mary was on the grilled cheese sandwich.

The cushions he is talking about don't exist.  The main cause of global warming is global cooling.  Since the earth stays a bit above the melting temperature of water, the main cause for warming is to move back to equilibrium from cooling.  <br>  <br>  I am kidding a bit.  There really is no such thing as "global warming".  That is a phrase invented recently that is more political than technical. <br>  <br>  It was cooler about 300 years ago probably due to solar output.  This period is called the Maunder Minimum or Little Ice Age.  Today, we live in the Modern Maximum.  The minimum / maximum refers to sunspots.  It has been observed that the sunspots correlate to climate. There are several cycles of the sun, the most obvious is the 11 year cycle.  There is also a cycle that relates to our orbit around the sun and the axis of rotation called the Milankovitch Cycle.  That is one of the causes of our current Ice Age.  We are currently in an interglacial period of the Ice Age.  In other words, we are fortunate to be living in a warm modern times, primarily due to natural causes.  Is there a chance that human emissions of CO2 has changed the climate in a miniscule way.  Yes.  Is there reason to be alarmed.  Not in my opinion.  <br>  <br>  Lily, Lily, Lily,  She actually believes that the NY times is fair and balanced.  She probably thinks it is fair and balanced to McCain as well.

Look at the ice age and such and you will see that the earth naturally warms and cools at regular intervals.  We can also tell a lot about the types of clothing people wore during certain time periods.  Areas of Europe that are typically very cool and require long sleeves almost year round were known to have decades worth of clothing changes that were short sleeved and didn't consist of much bundling up so to speak because the climate was so warm during those periods PRIOR to modern technology which we are blaming it on now.

The majority of the CO2 that is emitted come from global volcanic activity. Man in the last 200 years has become a great consumer of the the subsurface fluid  and gas resources, such as oil, natural gas and water.  As demand increased, natural conditions of replenishment did not occur.  Tectonic plates and geologic structures rely to a certain extent of cushion, sort of like a knee joint.  When the fluid disappears of becomes depleted, grinding occurs more frequently with some time devastating effects ( earthquakes, volcanoes etc...). As the globes surface heats, geologic activity increases.

The world had an ice age 10,000 years ago, Al  Gore would have said that it was because of global warning. Dumb Liberal Democrat Al burns tens of thousands of pounds in jet fuel while traveling the globe, to tell people not to burn fossil fuels. Why does he practice "do as I day, not as I do"? It seems to me that he should just start a Liberal Democrat Tree Hugger web site to "warn" people of global warming doom-and-gloom, instead of wasting jet fuel.|`|nunZMnhWaa	Whether it is warmer today than 100years ago is not the issue on hand. It is the concept that the current climate optimum is harmful and caused by human civilization that is false! The best science professionals all feel that sunspots are the major item affecting climate variations. Historically this is why scientifically warm periods like we are currently experiencing are called climate optimums. They differ from cold periods such as the little ice age that ended 180 years ago, which are called climate minimums, because they minimize the world’s population through less food and more sickness. Since the almost extinction of the human race during the last ice age the warm climate optimums have brought population expansion because life is better when it is warm and there is more food to eat. Climate minimums like the dark ages and the little ice age are periods of starvation and sickness.<br>  <br>  Climate optimums like the Holocene, Roman and medieval are times of plentiful food and comfortable weather that naturally brings population increase in every animal type from ants to humans. Only a real fool would freak out just because the weather is good, but then liberals and their AGW companions have never been considered very bright. If they were they would be skeptics!

Basically, humans are putting too much CO2 into the atmosphere than it can manage. The carbon cycle is very delicate, the majority of carbon in the cycle is in fossil fuels, under the earth. the least is in the atmosphere (or so it should be). slowly we are tipping the scale, as we dig fossil fuels out of the earth, and put them into the atmosphere. We emit carbon into the atmosphere through driving cars, factories, airplanes, and the vast majority of livestock we raise for human consumption (they release gas, and we cut down trees to give them grazing land, kind of a negative negative). These emissions go up into the atmosphere where they sit above the cloud layer and accumulate.<br>  Before we pumped the atmosphere full of CO2, the sun's rays, UV rays, came into the atmosphere, heated the earth, and then left. Now, they come in, but the thick layer of CO2 accumulating, is stopping them from exiting, heating the earth. <br>  Some people believe that the sun's rays cause global warming, well they are right! BUTTTT... they believe that it doesn't have anything to do with human activities, well that is a "do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars" answer. the sun's rays have been heating the earth for as long as it has existed, then we came around. <br>  People expect when they hear 'global warming', that the earth is going to heat up oh i don't know 10 degrees a year. They don't understand that the 1 degree that it DOES go up a year on average makes a huge difference! No, you probably wont FEEL it, but the past 10 years have had the hottest temperatures on record, for the PLANET. Already, the ice in antarctica has began to melt, and it has been recorded that polar bears have begun to drown because their normal hunting time out on the ice (to catch fur seals) the ice is melting right under them. The ocean's coral reefs have begun to become 'bleached', and die because the rising ocean temperatures, and jellyfish have been invading the seas in record number (their pollups hatch only at a certain temperature once every 10 years, but now the ocean temperature has gone up so much, they are hatching like crazy). <br>  <br>  Check out the websites. I provide non-bias websites, like from NASA, and "National Geographic". What you have to do is LOOK AT THE FACTS. You have to make the connections. Humans can't possibly think that they can pump all the CO2 into the atmosphere, and there wouldn't be consequences.<br>  <br>  I hope you enjoyed my argument, and saw the obvious facts proving global warming.<br>  <br>  Lily K|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Political speeches|`|DunP3Ruraa	i think that the earth goes thru its own natural climate changes, and that man doesnt really have that much affect, one way or another.  however, i do believe that we should do our utmost to keep our pollutions at a minimum, and do our best to be "green".  it has its own advantages, besides that of being good for the planet.  |`|Z4tO9f7uaa	well its caused by the pollution that we humans make. the green houses have gases that are harm full for the earth. we should redoes reuse and recycle in the first place. we should use less cars buses ar better because more people take the buss so less cars so a little bit better

No pirate would think of trying to board a ship at that speed if they could even keep up with us.|`|KfCJDp0Laa	but, brother, how can you leave his noodly appendage out of anything?<br>  <br>  seriously now, pirates can indeed affect global warming by increasing emissions from shipping, by making them go the long way round to avoid dangerous straights, and going faster.<br>  <br>  edit; dawei, its a joke. see this ' Open Letter To Kansas School Board', the pirates/warming correlation is used as an example to back up an appeal for the alternative theory that the world was created by his noodliness to be taught alongside 'intelligent design'.<br>  <a href="http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/" rel="nofollow">http://www.venganza.org/about/open-lette...</a>|`|SIWh4UCyaa	Pirates?<br>  Well it would have had some effect first all the stars, like Johny Depp had private cars and helicopters and all the other vehicles used by the crew and plane flights to the locations.<br>  Then there all the millions of people who used cars to go and see it at the movies or later when it was released on DVD.<br>  I'm sure this is what you meant by Pirates, wasn't it! or were you just being pointless.<br>  |`|aWTo9K22aa	Why are you trying to connect something as arbitrary as pirates to global warming? Squirrels probably had more of an effect on climate than all of the piracy of the last 100 years combined.|`|luqg92fTaa	Avast! I'm glad ye asked me. Us Pirates love global warming so much that I lit a super tanker on fire just the other day to heat things up a wee bit. Firstly it gives us greater reach, we can sail to further latitudes without getting cold. As you know we pirates love to hang in the torpic regions because that is where me rum tastes best. The rising sea-level gives me more navagatable waters to do me pillaging. The dying economy weakens governments that would try to stop me. additionally hippies whining about AGW distract the government who must channel money to fighting AGW and they send that national guard to hit the hippies with sticks instead of sending them to fight us pirates. Alas I love the global warming it makes me life very easy.
