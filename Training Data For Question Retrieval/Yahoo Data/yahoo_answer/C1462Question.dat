Goals become: 1) realistic and attainable or 2) unrealistic and unattainable. I have a goal that i want to become a pharmacist. But to me, it's a unrealistic and unattainable goal due to some circumstances. I know people would say "if you don't ever try it how would you know that you can't do it"(that sort of things). I am afraid to try it because it is not something cheap to try in term of money and time. Should I try to focus on more realistic goal in my life? Please provide your wise opinion, like to hear from people with sagacity. Thank you.

E - absolute tosh      or a variation of the above in your own words....

20090219135102AALxTMI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	God is essentially One in essence and in life, in His Godhead. Yet He is Three, Father, Son and Spirit?	When we look at accounts in the Old Testament where God has made physical contact with man, in which Person of the Trinity does He do this?   Eg. The three Hebrews, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego ( Dan 3:24-26)   Eating with Abraham in Genesis 18.   Wrestling with Jacob  in Genesis 32.   Walking in the cool of the day in Eden in Gen 3:8.   Speaking face to face with Moses in Numbers 12:8.      We know that God the Father dwells in unapproachable light and is described as a " consuming fire", yet, somehow, in the holy Trinity, Jehovah God has had physical contact with man, not only in the New Testament, but also in the Old Testament.  We know that ultimately, God came to us in the Person of the Son, has this always been His way of doing things?         Can you share your portion regarding which Person of the Triune God is seen and even handled in the Old Testament?      Thank you for taking the time to look into this post.   In Christ   sandy
20090219135159AAUxtLa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you guys think of Mike Murdock?	I was reading a site page on him and they were calling him a thief.   But what I find interesting is that a verse Mike Murdock used was actually right, and yet they .tried to disregard it by saying read back a few verses. Yet it still applied with the same principle.   Here is the verse and some of the guy's commentary:   "Luke 6:38, "Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."  Would you please read back just one verse to Luke 6:37, "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven."  Clearly, Jesus was speaking about forgiveness here, and NOT financial gain!"      See Murdock is greatly known for his messages on tithing and offering and it seems people have a problem when people use the Bible and say it talks about prosperity.   To tell you the truth that verse was talking not only about prosperity but a law of the universe. "Give and you shall receive." Even God follows this principle. He(God) gave His Son and He then received us. And not only that but think God got more than a hundred fold.      My point is, that Murdock isn't spreading lies but he is actually quoting the word of God, that God wants His children to be prosperous.      I believe the principle is in one of Pat Robertson's books. It basically says what you give is what you receive. Give love, get love. Give hate, get hate, etc.

20090219132215AAv8bVl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: Why do you only believe in the CHRISTIAN GOD, yet you criticize atheists?	Christians: think of a god you don't believe in and why you don't believe in it. Your answer will probably be that you have no reason to bother and/or you have good reasons to think that that god does not or cannot exist. Well, atheists don't believe for the same sorts of reasons. Most theists are monotheists, which means that they reject all of the tens of thousands of alleged gods except one; atheists simply don't make an exception for that last one.       You're all hypocrites.

Almost 2 years ago, I was drunk, and had sex with a man whore. A month later, I started having severe symptoms of strep throat. I had never had strep throat before, and I knew of no one else around me that was sick with strep or anything else! So i started googling strep and that's where I came across a few articles that said strep throat was a sign of HIV. Well this freaked me the f**k out! The strep was getting worse and I was becoming more and more worried that I had HIV. Well one day I broke down to my knees crying, made a promise to God that I would not have sex until I was married in hopes that I did not have HIV. Well I got tested, and thank God, I didn't have it.    Before I made this promise, I had no problem with sex. I believed it was natural and if people wanna do it, fine. I still believe that way today, however since i made that promise for the sake of my life, i feel horrible for being tempted into sex. I'm at the point to where I actually fear God at times because I want to break this promise.I actually already have once with a bf i had last year. I love God with all my heart, I don't want to betray him.

Are Muslims so literal and insecure that they need the Koran to be physically lifted upward to show respect?! Should this be taken to the ridicules extreme of puting it close to the ceiling? On the roof? What?!

20090219154522AASxOqF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually speaking, those who create their life, what does it mean to say that the past doesn't dictate the?	The past doesn't dictate the future.....I see so many people who live with new thoughts & are not using the past as anything to create their life other than to take positive ideas from it.       As one example, a person who has an illness now that in the past just destroyed people yet they decide to do whatever it takes to heal & they get better they have not allowed the past to dictate their future.      Can you share any examples of this with me?      I am not looking for people who want to share that this is not possible. My question is directed to those who can give positive examples of how we can think new thoughts & get new results.      I am not just looking for health examples. Dig deep. How can we see things in a better way for the future? What is possible with new thoughts. I see people who are going from rags to riches in a time when most of complaining...so what ways can we see things differently & create a better life, a better world, etc.

20090219153500AAqK5WA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do alot of christians, not all but alot mock Islam and dislike Muslims?	It would appear to me that Muslims are more faithful in their following of Gods Holy Word, yet Some Christians mock them.  If you do not know this Islam means the Complete submission to the will of God. The same God that Abraham from The Bible worshipped. The Same God Jesus worshipped. Do you know Muslims pray to God 5 times a day? That is how faithful these people are and they also make sure they are clean when presenting themselves before God.

20090219144340AAs4aEB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why would god punish people who cannot be held accountable for things, and call himself 'just'?	There are two options. Either A) people who have not heard of the bible or Jesus Christ, though they are not responsible for anything that has happened to them, go to hell simply because they never knew Jesus. This raises question's about gods just nature, when he can allow this injustice to reign. It seems highly unfair, and the opposite of justness.      or B) Those people go straight to heaven, because god understands that they cannot help what has happened to them, and so he forgives them. In this case, it would seem prudent that we immediately destroy the bible and any and all traces of the christian religion, so that nobody knows of it and so everyone instantly earns a free pass to heaven. Happy ending.      Both seem to raise questions... which is true, and what answer do you have to it?

20090219150248AAqGid5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Psychics, please help me. Questions about my love life....?	Ok, first, let me tell you a bit about myself since I know it's hard to do this kind of stuff over the internet with little information.      I'm a quiet, sympathetic, sensitive, 16 year old gay male. I don't really want to tell anyone I'm gay until I really trust them. I haven't even told my friend from grammar school and we knew each other for currently 4 years! I'm still not sure if I can trust him with my secret. The only people who currently know is my 2 cousins and possibly another one of my cousins. I told one of my gay friends that I was gay but me and him don't talk anymore. Our friendship grew distant. After that, I told one of my female friends that I was gay and me and her don't talk anymore because she keeps getting into fights and getting on punishment. She sometimes sneak on the computer at night so that we can talk.      One of my first major crushes was the friend from my grammar school who knew me for 4 years. He used to give me "hints" but probably he was just playing around, who knows? Even if he was bi-sexual and scared to tell anyone, he has a girlfriend and I accepted the fact that we can't be together if things are like this. I've got rid of my crush for him. Thank God I never told him I had a crush on him. I'm not even sure how he'd react to me telling him that I'm gay let alone that I like him.      There was this boy from grammar school who was so beautiful. He was light-skin, Puerto Rican, had nice eyes and a sexy voice. I could never speak to him though because I would always get shy around him. We do know each other though, I mean, he was in my class for a whole year in grammar school and we would say "what's up" to each other and stuff. In the summer time, I had a dream that me and him were dating which is weird since I wasn't even obsessing over him at that time. A few days later, he called my HOUSE phone. I was thinking to myself "How!? I've never given any friend my house phone number and he doesn't know any family members, so how!?". I send him a message on Myspace asking "did you call me?" but he never said anything back. He still says "what's up" to me when he sees me though but we don't see each other a lot.      Another recent crush was this boy who gave me a video game. He also got jealous that my best friend (a girl) was hanging out with me.      The most recent crush is my other friend. Let's call him "T". When I was in his class, T always tried to make me laugh. I asked my parents for a new video game system and they said "no", then I told T about it and someone heard. They started to make fun of me and T cracked on them for me. He told me that he'll give me some of his games. Also, he always tries to see who I'm texting. He even asked me if I had a girlfriend but I said "no".      On Friday, we hanged out. We hanged out from 3PM to 8PM, just me and him. He took me to his house but said that I couldn't go in because his sister was there and she is really, really mean. He was concerned that I was gonna get sick so he gave me one of his hats. He also payed my way for the bus and bought me headphones. Then, he told me that he entered a competition to win the game system that I wanted.      He is very concerned about me. He tells me to put on my hood in the cold. He got mad because I took off from school. He seems very concerned about my well being.      Also, when me and him were walking, I almost slipped because of the ice. He told me to watch out before I embarrass myself. Then he said "Never mind, I'll never let you fall but if you do...I'll fall down with you....". I tried calling him twice but he never called me back.      What's going on psychics? Why are these guys acting like this? Giving hints but never saying anything when I try to talk to them? Besides that why say something as romantic as " I'll never let you fall but if you do...I'll fall down with you...." but then don't even come in contact with me a lot anymore?      We he does come in contact at lunch time but I hang out with some other friends. After school, I wish I could see him and when I do HE is with some other friends.      I was mad that he told this gay guy that he was bi-curious but he hasn't told ME a thing. That just pissed me off. But, I'm not even going to make myself angry by thinking of it.      I'm being as positive as I can be...      I TRUST and EXPECT the God/Universe will one day arrange for me and my soul-mate to be together but I'm curious about these guys I've talked about here? Is there any future with any of them? Where do you see my love life going?         Where do you see my love life headed?

20090219142435AAqIEBI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How to handle very religious in-laws when your beliefs are different?	Ok so my mother in-law is very adamant about getting everyone in her family to go to church.  Well my husband and I have clearly stated that we do not want to go to church and that we have different beliefs and would like to be left alone in that department (we know they are only trying to help).  We have our first child on the way and want to let our child tell us when they wish to study religion if ever, we have strong beliefs that everyone has a voice.  So, yesterday I got an e-mail from a church down the street inviting us in.  They knew our nicknames, address, and my husbands status in the military.  With my husbands certain job in the military we don't really like people knowing everything about us for security reasons.  Any way, I sent a reply asking how they obtained all of that info, and come to find my mother-in law sent a request to them saying we need God in our life, and to please contact us (the church forwarded the e-mail to me).  On my facebook page I put a status of "Jess wishes people could just except our families beliefs".  Well all of his sisters (3) sent me e-mails saying that I offended the entire family and that I disrespected everyone.  Why is it that I cannot have a voice for my family (what my husband and I both believe in), but they feel we have to be ok with what they say and do..whether it be loving or offending?  Any ideas?  Again I understand they were only trying to help, but we are offended by this and feel that if we tell them that WE are in the wrong.      sorry so long!

Because as far as my church upbringing has taught me, only God knows, and He did NOT have them put it in the Book :)   I would be very interested to find this in my Bible.   Are we looking at different books?
20090219144228AARJFyQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Book that debates christianity with a full view on opposing sides?	there may not be one book that does this so any suggestions would be appreciated. i am looking for a book that has done its research well. not a book that limits information only to philosophers and scientists that are very religious already. im looking for a book to show most of the concerns on both sides without the book really picking only one side to argue against. anything close to my description will do because i know there probably is isnt one perfect book.
20090219144734AAyDzaL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for Young Earth Creationists and Noah's Flood. How do you explain documented history shortly after?	According to research I've done on YEC websites the average accepted date of Noah's flood is 2344 BCE. If this is so then how do you explain the existence of documented Egyptian civilization shortly after the flood. There are pyramid documents dated from 2300 to 2400 BCE and the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh that dates from 2000 to 2150 BCE. There is no way that Noah and his family could have given rise to these civilizations in such a short time. I look forward to your answers.
20090219154410AA5dEDu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Creationists, where are you getting your information about evolution? From science or from your church leaders?	I've done a lot of online research about the creation vs evolution debate and it is obvious that most creationists don't know much about evolution.        Creationists claim that evolution is "JUST A THEORY". Do you even know what the definition of a theory is. Merriam-Webster Dictionary defins it as "the analysis of a set of facts in their relation to one another".  The Theory of Evolution has been around for about 150 years and if it wasn't true science would have discounted it long ago. That's what science does. If it cannot stand up to peer review it is discarded.       Instead of relying only on religious leaders who want to keep their power and control, start to think for yourselves and do some research. I'm an atheist and don't believe in any gods but you can believe in evolution and still be a christian.       Sorry I rambled on like that but knowledge is one of the greatest gifts we could receive and it makes me sad that people blindly follow their religious leaders.

Should we be celebrating Christmas if it is not a festival of God,I regret ever going to those church sites where you can request free literature and booklets and other things,some years ago I read them and learned the truth about Christmas and it's paganism,I was SHOCKED to learn that it is a man made holiday that has nothing to do with Jesus and can't be found in the bible,now last Christmas(2008) didn't feel like Christmas at all because it felt like a normal day to me,but I listen to some Christmas music and the spirit of Christmas  came to me.

20090219150746AARQ4Hx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do Christians like Sherri Shepard still insist the Earth is flat?	Is it because the Bible says so?  I found this somewhere:      Disregarding the dome, the essential flatness of the earth's surface is required by verses like Daniel 4:10-11. In Daniel, the king “saw a tree of great height at the centre of the earth...reaching with its top to the sky and visible to the earth's farthest bounds.” If the earth were flat, a sufficiently tall tree would be visible to “the earth's farthest bounds,” but this is impossible on a spherical earth. Likewise, in describing the temptation of Jesus by Satan, Matthew 4:8 says, “Once again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world [cosmos] in their glory.” Obviously, this would be possible only if the earth were flat. The same is true of Revelation 1:7: “Behold, he is coming with the clouds! Every eye shall see him...”
20090219150931AAAe6XI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Segregated Catholic churches in the south?	I'm not catholic but attend catholic church once in a while with my wife and her mother. And over the years I have noticed one thing. There isn't any white people there! Well let me reprise that there is only about a hand full at the most. I asked about it and was informed that "the whites go to another catholic church on the other side of town." And then I started to pay attention to things like the priest is always either form another country or black you never really see a white priest at a catholic church attended by mostly blacks. Is this by design of the catholic church or by the people that attend the church.  Why is it that Father O'Brien is at the white church and Father Jose is at the Black church. And why would a town that is small as the one my wife is from have 2 catholic churches anyway?

I praid for months every night from nov 08 to feb 09. I praid simple, just god please send me a boyfreind, send me some1 it don't mater just send me some1 i love and who will love me. didnt think it would work.but you know what? last week one of my best guy freinds ask me out and i was soooo happy. My Christain friend said remember i told you about the prayer and i remembered. so the power of prayer really works and now i'm here to tell you to give it a chance because it DOES WORK if you just do it long enouph and just be pashent. So I am Christain now because I praid to god he answered and thats all the proof i need. people say prayer doesnt work because they dont wait long enouph.       Why dont you give it a chance is all i ask.

When the Christians spread as far as Northern Europe they plagurised the ancient pagan festivals and took them on as thier own. But what and where are the elements to your own festivals.      These are all from my ancient culture:      The Messiah - The Sun in the cross contstellation as depicted by the Celtic Cross.      25th dec. - The birth of the new Sun, after dying by droping below the horizon in the winter, the Sun by 25th dec is just above the horizon again.      Easter - Spring fertility festival, the ressurection of life. The Sun has risen to the centre of the cross constallation... Celtic Cross.      Fertility bunnies   Fertility eggs.    Santa   Sleigh   Red and White - the colour of magic mushrooms to make reindeer fly.   Elves   Fir tree's   tinsel   Holly   Ivy   Mistletoe   Feasting   Gathering   Giving gifts   Carol's - Wassailing   Midnight mass on winter solstice         The list is endless and pure animistic pagan in origin. It seems all you have done is substitute the Sun for your Jesus. ?      Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.

I am Egyptian, here, every teen in the street is walking with an ear piece and listening to songs. And they are just turning into stupid. I dont know whats wrong, i didnt know words like *** exist untill i was 11, now, a 6 year old kid says *** u btch. The generation is just weird. And also alot of teens interests are symmetric about bf/gf and sex. And in USA from what i've seen from chatting, alot of American teens has psychological problems so deeply, and are very very very symmetric about music and having lovers and sex. You see a kid who's 13 asking about sex instead of asking about anything useful to her. Kids who let us do their homeworks on math section and promise they will give you best answer but they dont. I POSTED THIS BECAUSE IT GOT ME MAD, i spent 15 minutes answering step by step a stupid equation for just 10 points. She didnt give me anything. No one looks up to be scientists or anythin, all wanna be singers and celebrities. Its weird. I know teachers care more about student's feeling than his education. But how can we change that? I asked before about the reason in here, you guys gave me the answer, how could this change? Obama? The new holy change is not doing anything. He is actually getting the troops out of Iraq to Afghanistan which cancels this stupid change Americans are deluded about. Americans wanted the troops out because they want the troops, they dont care about Iraq, but he is sending another troops in Afghanistan, how could everyone be silent about this?

20090203061821AAc42yQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How is this not a contradiction?	Romans 7:2-3 2   For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.   3   So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.      1st Corinthians 7:12-15 12   But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.   13   And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.   14   For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.   15   But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.      The reason I asked this question, because it shouldn't matter if ones a believer or not. Cause anyone can use that excuse to divorce someone. Or they can say, well he wasn't a believer because she cheated on me, and you can't be a adulterer and a believer, so I want a divorce. Jesus said there is only one way for a divorce and that is through fornication. Nothing to do with one being a unbeliever. So what Paul states is a contradiction? If not please explain

I don't think Maggie understands that she is hurting herself and the others around her. You should talk to her alone, at lunch, or at any free time, and explain to her that cutting doesn't solve your problems, it just makes them worse. She will need to meet with a professional, and over time the cutting will stop. Make sure that if she doesn't tell her parents, you tell them, because they're her parents and they'll understand. Just make sure that Maggie meets with a professional. I hope everything will go well.   Adolescent expert.      Please don not use a translator, and I live in Canada so yeah...   Thank you!

20090203054901AATFqK2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Seriously: why is it so difficult to grasp the distinction between ?reason? and ?faith??	Scientist don't embrace faith, at least not regarding science:    they count on evidence or else reject the hypotheses. That's exactly the point. For a simple reason, in science there aren't absolute truths, only prevailing truths. And faith requires your complete certainty and in the face of absence of evidence.      Prevailing truth (through) some evidence or logic (induction, deduction,etc...)  = reason.      Absolute certainty (through) zero or conflicting evidence = faith.      It's really easy to grasp. Really.

20090203052209AAbYZFS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do Christians decide what to take literally, and what NOT to take literally in the bible?	For example, I would wager many Christians on here would say "the talking donkey and talking snake parts of the bible are not to be taken literally".    Yet they would then perhaps say that the hellfire thing IS to be taken literally.     It seems lots of Christians are just choosing what is meant to be taken literally and what isn't to suit their own agendas.    Like, lots of Christians say that the bible condemns homosexuality (this is in the old testament) - yet they then say that the old testament should be ignored.    It's frustrating.    Why do Christians pick and choose like this?      Surely the honest thing to do is follow the bible to the letter, or not at all. Didn't Jesus say something about being lukewarm? Neither hot nor cold?

20090203050444AAQcVDt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, Is the JESUS story original?	Please read:   Attis of Phrygia 1170 BC.       Speaking of this crucified Messiah, the Anacalypsis informs us that several histories are given of him, but all concur in representing him as having been an atoning offering for sin. And the Latin phrase suspensus lingo, found in his history, indicates the manner of his death. He was suspended on a tree, crucified, buried and rose again.

20090203050129AA5FFO3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is Jesus The Way, The Truth and Life?	How many scriptures does it take saying that He is to make us believe it?   Name Him Jesus for He shall save His people from their sins.  Doesnt this imply He is God saving HIS people?   The Lamb in The Revelation of Jesus Christ:  "I am the Alpha and Omega"   Jesus said:  Before Abraham was, I am.  and  "If ye believe not that I am He you are dead in your sins".   Who but God could forgive sins,  heal the sick and make the blind to see?   Isaiah:  A just God and Savior, besides Me there is no other.  and   Unto us a child is born.  Unto us a Son is given.  The government shall be upon His shoulder and His Name shall be called Wonderful, Councelor, Everlasting Father, Almighty God, Prince of Peace.         Great is the mystery of The Eternal Godhead.  Our salvation does not depend on understanding it.  The Love, Grace and salvation of God is come to the world in The Name of Jesus Christ, not the titles of The Trinity.  "All the fulness of The Godhead dwelleth in Him bodily and ye are complete in Him who is the head of all principality and power".   "I am the way, the truth and the life.  No man cometh unto The Father but by Me."   "When you recieve me, you recieve not me, but Him who sent me."  "I am the door".   The first commandment to love God begins with:  Hear O'Israel, The Lord our God is one......"   It matters not whether there are 3 or 33 persons in The Eternal Godhead.  Only One bled and died on the cross to pay for your salvation and mine.  Jesus, The Lamb of God.  His blood is coin of the realm to pay off the debt of sin we all owe to God.  We collect it through baptism in His Name. Rev 1:5  "Unto Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood."  We recieve The Holy Ghost in His Name, and  "They were condemned because they did not believe in The Name of The Only Begotten Son of God"

20090203051318AAb4C76	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Would it be a sin if so why?	Why should I be punished for my husbands' lack of responsibility?  We have been married for 11 years and other then the beginning of our relationship, there is hardly any sexual intimacy.  The last say two years we average like once every two months.    About 5 years ago he didn't touch me for over 2 1/2 years.   We have lived out all of his fantasies and I only have one and yes I am still waiting....  It is very hard as all I do is question myself and emotionally it is devastating that my husband rejects me.          I know for a fact he is Not cheating on me with another woman as he  works out of our home.  If he is not with me and the kids he is on the computer working. He hates talking on the phone and there are No chat rooms downloaded on any of his computers, as I already checked long ago.   He is a home body for sure.          So being married we have responsibilities to each other and if one is not full-filling those responsibilities why should the other be punished with a sin if they seek elsewhere?  Doesn't everyone deserve to feel loved, special, wanted, desired, etc?   It just doesn't seem fair.    Oh, I have talked with him about this numerous times and it only seems to make him treat me more cold other then the fact he tells me he loves me a thousand times a day.   But actions speak louder then words.   So what do you all think?

20090219165420AAWgO4G	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christianity Confusion?	I believe that Jesus died for my sins in the way that people do when something has been drilled into them. I grew up in a very conservative religion and went to church school and church till 6th grade, and then my first two years of high school. My mother was of that religion and so were my siblings. My mother doesn't follow anything that was preached but feels she knows God best. My other siblings are atheists, and I am left confused.   I refuse to go to my old church because, frankly, I feel most churches are politically driven and don't practice what they're saying. Also, I believe Saturday is the day to worship, so that knocks out everything on Sunday.   The Bible doesn't make me feel any love for God. Sitting in church doesn't make me feel anything. But helping others does.    I am very confused because everyone is telling me something different. Some people say what I believe is wrong even though it comes from the Bible. They think that because I try to love everyone that I approve of what they do and are therefore just as bad.   How do I get out of this funk when reading the Bible doesn't help and Christians, for the most part, aren't helping. Is this just going to be something I have to figure out on my own?   Because I believe in God. I believe Jesus was a real person, but I don't know how to really FEEL that love with either of them (you know how people say they can feel it, and they always seem so happy). I hope somebody has good advice, you know, from people who actually care about what I'm trying to find.

They act as if the mere purpose for evolution is simply to take people away from church. Do these people not realize that Atheism has been around just as much as Theism?      Why must Christians become angry when Science simply gives the facts? Will people always be so self deluded that they can't even face reality? I mean sure if you are a Christian and still believe (although incredibly gullible) the Biblical story of "Creation" and find out that your story doesn't match up with Science I'm sure it would upset you. But since when does Evolution have anything to do with God? I'm honestly amazed by how so many people are so thrown into religion that anything that may change their ideas is like a concept of evil.      What say you?

20090220102013AAN7019	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	My Jehovah's Witness Wife Wants To Leave Me Because Of Blood...?	Last night we were having a discussion about our son who is almost 18 and does not accept the jw faith.  When the issue of a blood transfusion came up he asked me to give him blood if the doctor says he needs one.  I agreed.  My wife went nuts saying that I MUST never sign for him to accept blood.      My point is that if my son wants it I have NO RIGHT to force the jw beliefs of my wife onto him.  Even if I were still a jw and believed it wrong to get blood my conscience does not allow me to force a unbelieving person to take the same stand I would make. even my son.      Well, now my wife has told me that she needs to rethink our marriage because she cannot be married to a man like me who would force blood onto our son.....Whatever.      I have been researching and have found nothing in the jw literature so far to back me on my stand.  Does anyone know off hand what article or book might back me so I can get her off my back?

20090220095811AAxRem1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, If It Was Discovered That Satan Became a Fetus, Would You Advocate Abortion?	How about if the fetus was somehow contaminated with a biological agent that would infect and kill everybody on the planet as soon as the baby was delivered?      How about if the fetus was found to be a chemical nightmare and as soon as it was born would explode in a multi-megaton nuclear explosion, killing the entire Universe?      How about if God Himself appeared in the delivery room and said, “You must abort this baby, because this baby will grow up and kill the entire WORLD if you do not!”      What if it was discovered that the entire stimulus package would have to be used to keep this baby alive for ten minutes only, but it would be ten extra minutes of life and to be sure, no one could accuse us of murder!?      How about if you discovered a severely overlooked scripture in the actual Bible, that flatly said, “Thou shalt abort.”?  What if it was in one of those books that made it through the Canonization process and was actually included in the Canon of Scripture, but for some reason, today, is not found in most Bibles?
20090220093001AAzvOWj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why Does God Reveal Himself To You And Not Me?	For those with ears to hear…      1. Why would someone continue an experiment that has failed over and over again at the expense of other potential discoveries? (I simply do/did not feel, sense, believe ANY OF IT!)      2. Why keep trying when there are dozens of other religions to investigate - and so little time to investigate them all?      I DID pray, read the Bible, studied the Bible, waited patiently, listened for the still, small, voice of God - ask for the infilling of the Holy Spirit - fellowshipped with believers - fasted, exercised my faith, I confessed the Lord Jesus before others and told myself, NAY convinced myself that I KNEW Jesus Christ as my Lord and personal savior.  I told people that the only proof I have of Jesus is that Jesus lives in my heart...      I did all of this from the age of 16 to the age of 28.        But today I can honestly say that I never once experienced anything other than emotional manipulation from myself and the Church community, I only believed those things because I wanted them to be true - not because I really knew them to be true.      For years I only believed by faith – supplementing it with evidences from Christian apologists who explained to me ad nauseum how the Bible is historically and scientifically reliable (therefore I should believe) - Together with my faith, it should have been enough to sustain me.      I kept sin far from my heart and daily, put on the full armor of God and read the Word and prayed to be more like Jesus.      But in my heart, I knew that every time I told someone I KNEW Jesus - it was a lie.  But I would nonetheless convince myself that the Devil was deceiving me, etc, etc.  Though I believed and tried - I did not know Jesus at all.      I actively chose to not have ANY religion, but to call my faith a “relationship” – all I wanted was a personal relationship with the One True God.      Until, I began to research on my own, and realized that those apologists are dead wrong.  I researched so much that I ended up with a Doctorate in Religious Studies - and today, know beyond any doubt that, simply put, all the religions were completely made up - I know how they were manufactured and why.        I know about the corrupt Bible Manuscript Tradition and the dubious attempts to forge Jesus into extra-Biblical history to make him seem real.      It was (ironically) only after wholly accepting that God, in fact, is not there, that I had peace of mind.      I wonder, every time a Christian says to someone, "I know Jesus" - is there enough of the "honest self" left to yearn for truth instead of desire?      Does that nugget of doubt ever surface – that innermost self that knows better – and send a caveat before it is quenched with the veritable baptism of our era’s paradigm of delusion?      Does today’s monotheistic mindset envision a future that continually slouches towards Jerusalem?      This, coming from someone who has discovered what it's like to delude one's self.  I guess my challenge to Christians everywhere is obvious:      Admit your ignorance!
20090220092850AA50UQs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ex Christians, Do You Ever Tire Of Christians Insisting That You Were Never Saved?	Isn’t it ironic that we ex-Christians know the Bible better than most Christians?  Isn’t it further ironic that it was a “more complete” knowledge of Christianity that drove us away?      I remember claiming that my faith was my life.  That nothing could separate me from the love of God…      But isn’t it funny how belief works?        You can actually learn things about your belief that cause it to change completely!      i.e., If I believed that Santa Claus were real, even though I really, really believed it- and even though I had some historical evidence for Santa and the testimony of millions as to his existence….      I would be wrong.   But that doesn’t mean that I was never a believer does it?  I truly was, but when I became a man – I put away childish things.  I learned that there comes a time when one must replace magic and pretend for reality and truth.      Ex-Christians, have you noticed a paradigm shift – in your lifetime - that seems to value reason and logic and reality more than pretend things?      What are the dynamics that contribute to this?      Do you suppose it’s something more than the Christian answer, “IN THE END THERE WILL COME A GREAT FALLING AWAY….”  and “there will come deceivers…”  and “if it were possible, even the very elect will be deceived…” and “the wisdom of men is foolishness to the Lord…”      “You were never saved!”      I suppose that this is one of those things that Christians MUST say, in order to present an explanation for the apparent inability of God to convince or manifest in a former believer’s life.      OF COURSE, there are enough scriptures to provide an alternative answer (which is the case, curiously, for many various doctrines) such as:      “Well, you may have been saved, but you ‘turned from the faith’” or “You were deceived” or “You are still saved, because Jesus never let you go, but you are just in a faith crises, because once you know God, you can never turn away…”      Of course, we ex-Christians know that each of these is untrue.  Once you have been freed from the bondage to a God slave-master, the inexpressible liberty is something undeniable.  It is the greatest feeling in the World, is to be true.
20090220095256AA8ZHWs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are Christians Hedgehogs and Atheists Foxes?	In 1953 political philosopher Isaiah Berlin said that hedgehogs "know one big thing." They apply that one thing everywhere; they dismiss opposing views and they like top-down arguments deduced from that "big idea". Hedgehogs seek certainty and closure, dismiss information that undercuts their preconceptions and hold onto evidence that reinforces them. He called this "belief defense and bolstering."      He also said foxes, "know many things". They consider competing views, make bottom-up inductive arguments from an array of facts and doubt the power of big ideas. Foxes are cognitively flexible, modest and open to self-criticism.       Does this seem to sum up the fundamental difference between most Christians and atheists?      Maybe Christians should change their symbol from a fish to a hedgehog.

You claim a finite crime does not deserve an infinite punishment, but let me ask you this:      If I was a judge and you committed a horrible crime, and I offered you a way to avoid paying for it yourself (Jesus) and you REFUSED to accept this free gift, wouldn't you ONLY have yourself to blame if you went to prison?      Also, the people that don't want the free gift do not want to be with God. They are essentially getting what they want.

20090220101437AAfsFS9	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Odd scenario??????????	Alright I am a heterosexual 17 year old male in highschool. I have never had a crush on a dude and dudes never subconciosuly or conciously enter my mind when I fanatize about sex. and they still don't.   Their is this guy in my class who is effemine and looks like a girl with a nose ring and people call him names because he looks gay and different sometimes. We run in totally seperate crowds and I have my friends that I chill with. Well about a month ago I get automatically paired with him for a yearly project that is due at the end of the year. I first I was like no way. I wanted my teacher to switch but he sayed it was random and that was that. Guys in my class were making fun of my sisuation in a jokingly way. Well when we first started to talk to each other and I was distance, rude and mean. He wasn't mean back. I don't know but he would say you don't have to act like that just because people do it. I eventually stopped with it because he seemed so geniuely sincere and nice. He is the nicest person I have ever met. He seems so much more sincere then my friends who I currently have. We have become such good friends that I think that he is now the closest friend that I have now.I have cryed infront of him because I have told him things I would never tell anyone besides my parents, and he didn't sit their and judge me and call me a wuss like some would.I am not pyshically and emotionally attracted to him at all, and he is not really gay but i don't know, he is just is different. But people are looking at me because I am hanging out with him alot and people are starting to question me. My parents and siblings will give me strange looks if I bring him over to hang out. What do I do? This is so odd and I never thought I would find myself in this sisuation.

20090203071006AATV6rW	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How do you deal with shady,manipulative people who you don't trust?	I mean whether it be former landlords, former roomates, car repair mechanics, gas station attendants, mall retail workers, friends, whoever.....if you sense that they're only being nice to you because they want something from you, or want to use you, or think you come from money and they want to milk it, whatever the case may be, how do you handle those types?      Yesterday I had this worker at macys go "oh that looks GREAT on you," and wanted me to buy 7 pairs of the same jacket and started to ring them up, and I was like, WTF are u DOING? I'm trying those ON!       Or car mechanics who try to get your car in there every other month, and charge up up the wall for it,      or friends , former landlords, people who keep trying to associate with you and mingle with you simply because they want to run into you in the future and do business with you again, people k9ssing your A, or only wanting to be around you and treat you well because they think you're an easy target or something;      I have this happen to me all the time. I'm moderately well off, I'm a nice guy and I think that's all it takes to have these snakes/wolves try to get some of my money.         How do you trust anyone or protect yourself, or even DEAL with these people if you SENSE that they might be shady/manipulative, or just not all there?      I really do pick up on those vibes, it's easy for me to tell, I have very strong character discernment,and SOOOOOOOOOO many people uot there especially nowadays have false intentions.         I mean, it's like player central, and I can't afford to keep pondering what goes on in their scr9wed up minds. It takes alot of me and saps me of my energies.            Any advice? I mean the best thing to be would be to just let it go...let them go. they're not worth it, but I mean it gets to the point where if enough people are doing it, it just makes you feel bad. It's insane, and so many people are being manipulative like that nowadays.         Where have all the good people gone?

20090203063107AApoWtu	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What more can I do about my bothersome neighbors?	This is an on going problem, but I will try to sum it up nice & short.      My neighbors (landlord's daughter & her boyfriend) who live beneath me are very loud people in the sense that they fight & beat on one another.       The male was kind to me a few months back & said if they were ever too loud I could ask them to keep it down, that it was ok. So that is what I did tonight, they were blasting their music (at 2am), so I asked them to please keep it down. They threw a huge fit & made so much noise that I called the police.      First time the police just told them to keep it down. They left, and then the landlord's daughter started screaming outside that she wanted to fight me. I called the police again & they said they were going to arrest her, but then I guess she started talking & she gave them information on where to find some dope dealers, so they just gave her a citation/warning.      I would of felt better if they had arrested her, because now she is mad & my car is just sitting outside waiting for her to attack... also, she can get a key to my place from her mother (the landlord), & steal or trash my stuff when I go to work today.      Thank you for reading, I know that was a lot of information, but my question is, what do I do now? If she does trash my car how could I prove it was her? What if she trashes or steals things from my home? I live alone & I am an older woman. Does anyone out there have any advise for me?       I'll appreciate anything I can get.

20090203070006AAeA0zg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are atheists able to feel or understand romantic love?  ?	By the belief of atheists, humans are just made of atoms and nothing more than another form of animals. Using this world view wouldn't atheist have lots of problem with developing loving relationships with the people around them?       If there is no god and humans have no souls, atheists don't have any reason to love others. Why don't we just go and stealing and killing if there is no god? Without God nothing is wrong and don't you support 'Survival of the fittest?         For believers we know that love is a gift from god and meeting of souls. But to an atheist, romantic love is nothing but a reason to getting sensual relief and exchanging bodily fluids. In that case, isn't rape a better and more effective way to achieve them instead of caring for the opposite sex and marriage?       So are atheists able to enjoy romantic love like us Christians?

( sort of take out of one pocket and put it in the other?)  I was shocked with how much contributions and offers to sell items at work came it.

So evolutionists are probably saying to the world that there was first two apelike creatures which were male and female without genetic defects and they reproduce many children who had no genetic defects and their children had sex each with each other and their children gave them a lot a grandchildren without genetic defects and their grandchildren had sex with each other and their grandchildren gave them great grandchildren without genetic defects and their great grandchildren had sex with each other and reproduce children.  And coincidently, that stuff stopped today?! why it stopped?  It just doesn't make any sense!  Why is it immoral today and for thousands of years?  Why having sex with a close relative is repulsive right now?  why babies are deform and have birth defects because his or her parents are close relatives?  evolutionists need to think things over and put their stupid theory away for good.

The other night I got a phone call from a girl I don't really know that well, but have spent time with. She is in an all girls school and asked me out to her own Valentines Dance. I first hesitated, as I'm NOT interested in her and told her that I would get back to her. I asked my parents and friends about this sticky situation and they all told me I should go with the girl...    The thing is some of my friends are making fun of me now, because this girl is quite different from the 'average' 17 year old... she is a bit nerdy in appearance and according to my friends - also annoying and an outsider.     I feel I've done the right thing by saying yes to her... but I feel as though people will be laughing at me during the dance... What should I do?    Have I done the right thing? How do I stop my friends from insulting me? And how will I keep the dance from being WAY awkward?     Thanks ;)

20090220100348AArFGsL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	THe differences between homosexuality and every other sin...?	I was contemplating why homosexuality is such a huge issue compared with other sins, then I figured it out: Homosexuality is the only sin that has absolutely 0 impact on your life.      Fornication: say what you want, but there is something special about saving yourself for marriage. Whether you think this is positive or negative or not, you must admit, it has a huge impact on how you live your life.      Adultery: cheating on someone is bad.      Stealing, murdering, not honoring your parents, greed, etc. All speek for themselves.      Heck, even the OT laws made sense. Tribe size was important, so all the laws were to keep people fertile and healthy.         However, homosexuality is the only "sin" that does not negatively impact someone's life in the least. One can be a Homosexual Christian who goes to mass every week, saves himself for marriage (assuming he can get married), then has a loving, lifelong monogamous relationship. He is free to follow every single one of God's commandments.      So why is homosexuality so different? Well, when you read a little closer, you can see. Jesus fulfilled the OT laws, so you can reject those, but the ones in the New Testamtnt seem to be strange, too. Seems they are probably a mistranslation:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_a...    (Sorry about the Wikipedia reference, but this information is common knowledge for scholars, and it DOES sum it up rather nicely)         So, homosexuality is different from every other sin, and could be in the Bible as a mistranslation...Could it be that maybe it is not a sin after all?

When I was eight years old, my best friend died in his sleep. He also was eight. Al was his name and when I was told of his death. I did not know what death was. When I went to the funeral home to look at his body. I started shaking him trying to wake him up. When I was told that he went to heaven, after we got home, I went and packed my suitcase. Where are you going? my foster mother asked me. I'm going to heaven with Al, I told her. When she told me that I could not go to heaven to be with Al just yet and told me that I needed to take my suitcase to my room. I stomped off to my room and cried myself to sleep. Here I am 42 years old and still trying to get to heaven to be with my best friend Al. Dam it Al, you got to go to heaven before me. That sucks. So tell me, instead of looking at death in a negative way, why not look at it as a positive thing. Unless of course you don't believe in heaven.

20090220113753AAAO9Hw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Pro Prop 8 supporters is this what you consider a good example?	LOS ANGELES, February 13, 2009 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Attorneys with the Alliance Defense Fund Center for Academic Freedom filed a lawsuit against officials of the Los Angeles Community College District Wednesday. The lawsuit comes after a professor censored and threatened to expel a student following a speech about marriage and his Christian faith during an open-ended assignment in a public speaking class.      On Nov. 24, 2008, Los Angeles City College speech professor John Matteson interrupted and ended Jonathan Lopez's presentation mid-speech, calling him a "fascist bastard" in front of the class for speaking about his faith, which included reading the dictionary definition of marriage and reciting two Bible verses. Instead of allowing Lopez to finish, Matteson told the other students they could leave if they were offended. When no one left, Matteson dismissed the class. Refusing to grade the assigned speech, Matteson wrote on Lopez's evaluation, "Ask God what your grade is."      One week later, after seeing Lopez talking to the college's dean of academic affairs, Matteson told Lopez that he would make sure he'd be expelled from school. Matteson's treatment of Lopez during his speech follows an earlier incident in which Matteson told his entire class after the November election, "If you voted yes on Proposition 8, you are a fascist bastard."       "Christian students shouldn't be penalized or discriminated against for speaking about their beliefs," said ADF Senior Counsel David French. "Public institutions of higher learning cannot selectively censor Christian speech. This student was speaking well within the confines of his professor's assignment when he was censored and ultimately threatened with expulsion."      "Professor Matteson clearly violated Mr. Lopez's free speech rights by engaging in viewpoint discrimination and retaliation because he disagreed with the student's religious beliefs," concluded French.       To express concerns to the College contact:

It is 1 out of 4 for all teenage girls.  Not to mention 80% of Americans claim to be Christians.      With statistics like these, I'd say that most Christian heterosexuals should be focusing on the morality of their own behavior rather than bashing or condemning "gay marriage".  There should be equal rights for all with no stone throwing.  We all have our own crosses to bare.      Furthermore, homosexual couples could be giving some of these children born out of wedlock a decent, loving home... just like heterosexual couples who are unable to have children.  I am sure a homosexual couple could provide a loving home just a well as any single parent in society today... if not better.

Dear Friends: What is the rule or stance in Islam protaning to the donations of organs or of the body after death?   My friend and I were wondering if their are rules or laws in Islam (or in any other religion) protainning to the matter of donating your body for use, either by a living person in need or for the cause of science, and medical studies (to further help humanity or life, not for the cause of death).  On one hand I think it is allowed because you are providing a charitable act by donating yourself.  It is a charitable act and it could save a life, or even more with the saving it brings.   On the other hand each and every body that contained a soul shall be resurrected on the day of judgement and that might be saying to God that God cannot resurrect me.  But yet God knows your intentions.  Also what shall become of the sins committed by that person who received the organ transplant.  Will they be appointed to the organ that did it, or the soul that impowered it?   Sorry for the length of the question but if you have any ideas, thoughts or answers please try and answer.

20090220060100AAYzPso	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Matthew 7:12 , What does it mean ? ( long question)?	Matthew 7:12.....So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets      Commentary   "This is the substance of all relative duty; all Scripture in a nutshell." Incomparable summary! How well called "the royal law!" (Jas 2:8; compare Ro 13:9). It is true that similar maxims are found floating in the writings of the cultivated Greeks and Romans, and naturally enough in the Rabbinical writings. But so expressed as it is here-in immediate connection with, and as the sum of such duties as has been just enjoined, and such principles as had been before taught-it is to be found nowhere else. And the best commentary upon this fact is, that never till our Lord came down thus to teach did men effectually and widely exemplify it in their practice. The precise sense of the maxim is best referred to common sense. It is not, of course, what-in our wayward, capricious, gasping moods-we should wish that men would do to us, that we are to hold ourselves bound to do to them; but only what-in the exercise of an impartial judgment, and putting ourselves in their place-we consider it reasonable that they should do to us, that we are to do to them.      Cross refference scriptures    Matt 22:40....."On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets."   Luke 6:31 "Treat others the same way you want them to treat you.      Romans 13:8 Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.      Galatians 5:14 For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, "YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF."      Is the Commentary correct ?   Can you comment on the cross refference scriptures ?   Have you heard the comment , do unto others first ? Is that what this scripture means ?   Is the scripture about revenge , respect or something else ?   Is it relevant today ?   What does it mean , sums up the Law and the Prophets ?   Can you add any other relevant scripture or comment ?      Personal note    I find this a very interesting scriptue & right at the core of Christianity

20090220053643AAU7cCD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How might I appropriately commemorate a barn owl whose death leaves me bereft?	I would love to hear from people of all faiths and none about how they would honour the passing of a wild bird with whom one has formed a (one-sided) relationship.      For two years, this beautiful bird has successfully raised a brood in my barn.  She and her mate fledged three young the first year and last year, despite the disappearance and presumed death of the male just at the point where the juveniles would have been at their most hungry and demanding, she achieved four fledged young.  I watched her every twilight during May-July, bringing small mammals to her chicks, and then watched their antics and her interaction with them.  It has been one of the greatest pleasures of my entire life.      Today, I found her dead.  We had two weeks of solid snow cover - so all the small mammals were invisible and unobtainable beneath the snow.  For the last few days, hunting's been possible again, but too late for her - she was desperately underweight and would have died of starvation.      From your religious or secular point of view, how would you honour such a life and death?

20090203084830AA843y7	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do we insult the people in society who keep us going?	I got some hate mail from someone today, they were angry because I do not believe in the Christian God. I messaged back saying I was way too busy to converse with them and answer their insults. They replied back with 'Yeah, I understand it's lunch time and McDonalds is quite busy'.      They obviously meant this as an insult. We've all heard thiss before. 'Dumb people become burger flippers'. I don't work in McDonalds, but if I did, why should I be ashmed? It got me thinking.      Why do we always insult, or use as an insult, the people who are the backbone of society? The people who serve us food so we can have fun and treat ourselves, people who pick up OUR trash off of the streets so we can live in cleanliness, people who clean our hotel/motel bedrooms so we can have a nice holiday, people who clean our public bathrooms so they are sanitary, or janitors in schools so our children and learn in a nice environment?      Without these people doing these hard jobs, life would be so much harder - it would be alot less enjoyable for us all. Why do so many people put them down, or see these people as inferior? They work hard for their money and enrich our lives a hundred fold. Why can't we see it? Arn't they the most important people in our societies?

What people matter to us? or is that individualized? Some say President Obama matters but President Bush mattered not...      Some people think drunks and drug addicts do not matter and cause there own problems....      Some people say a person on death row does not matter as they got what they deserve...   I am sure no one cared Ted Bundy was executed...      it's pretty easy to think people *matter* if it is the ones we love the ones we agree with,, the ones that share are values and ideas the ones we would welcome to our abode...      Some people say the Un-born matter some say they do not...   But isn't the purpose of Jesus Christ coming to earth to say GOD CARES ABOUT ALL...he cares about the people that other's say have no worth that are forgotten about....      So when I asked what does it matter what you do in this life if you are going to die anyways, isn't the honest answer to most people it doesn't.   Your life might matter to your loved ones, friends but the the majority of the world your life does not mean much that is just the human nature   People die everyday, abortions happen every day, do we think about it? no..because death is part of daily life.

Isn't that what truly matters in life?

I have accepted that Genesis is written to show that God is the creator but it didn't happen exactly like that.   Why must we build a wall separating religion and science? The two aren't battling against each other.   I believe, as a catholic, that evolution is true but was a system put in place by God so that species on the planet could develop.   Basically, I'm saying that yes, evolution is right but it is a work of God.   So those who follow science are credited and those who follow a religious path.

20090203072510AAe0huI	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do people put so much importance in marriage before having a baby?	PLEASE READ THE WHOLE Q FIRST!      I know that's the way things used to be done, dating, marriage, baby, but now i don't think it makes any difference, whats important is that the parents love each other and are a stable happy family, a marriage certificate doesn't make this happen (in fact it seems to have the opposite affect if you check out divorce stats) anyone can get married, it doesn't prove anything, it doesn't make you more ready for a baby, it doesn't make you stronger, it doesn't mean you love each other more, think you have to be stable and in love when you decide to get married so you are in already married at heart before the piece of paper. and if one of the couple wants to leave they will married or not, they dont think "oh wait cant leave im married!" they just file for divorce.    eg. which to you is a more stable relaltionship, a couple together 10years, unmarried, share house, bank account, are clearly in love and have a beautiful happy/healthy baby.   or    a couple together 10 years, married, share house, bank account, are clearly in love and have a beautiful happy/healthy baby.      to me there is no difference? the unmarried couple just felt either no need to get married because their relationship doesnt need proof (as marriage seems to be used as nowadays) or they dont believe in marriage because divorce is an option that so many people take so there really is no value to having that certificate anyway anymore.

So, does anyone know what (free) sites I can go to where I can find some "Love, Remembering You and/or Missing You NORWEGIAN songs to burn to a CD? Please help since time is of the essence! P.S. I am NOT very "computer literate" and I have never burned any CDs before. Besides being fairly simple to do, I also need them to be free as well! PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!   Thank you so much in advance!

Hi, is it true it has the sane meaning? how come people write for example :"glad to see your on YOUR purchasing your forth property".   shouldn’t it be "glad to see your on YOU ARE purchasing your forth property". I just see it so many times that perhaps there is a hidden agreement between Americans that your is a shorter version of you are or I do not completely understand the word your(?) THANKS.

20090220080351AAxvN4x	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How much risk to peoples lives is an acceptable risk?	It must be wrong to risk other peoples lives, whether for a good reason, no reason, or for pleasure.   Many daily activity's which we perform carry an inherent risk to others lives.   When we take a pleasure drive in our car we create a level of risk that someone will be killed just because we decided to take that drive.   I considered that we perhaps all consent to share risks inherent in life's activity's, such as driving. However we often risk others lives who are not engaged in the activity in which we are involved or who cannot give consent such as children.    Example surely we could not engage in a gun battle in a crowded street and say that the innocent bystanders who copped a bullet consented to that risk by being there.   So how can I resolve this ethical problem, so far I have had no luck.   PS Atheists Yes I know that ethics are an invention so that we can successfuly live/work together as hunter gatherers, but as we all live as if ethics are real this question can only be answered from an ethical point of veiw.
20090220051052AAVfMpC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What would be a good comeback to someone who sends you this email?	Knowing you are an agnostic Buddhist.      FLORIDA COURT SETS ATHEIST HOLY DAY       In Florida , an atheist created a case against the upcoming Easter and    Passover holy days. He hired an attorney to bring a discrimination    case against Christians, Jews and observances of their holy days.       The argument was that it was unfair that atheists had no such recognized    days.       The case was brought before a judge. After listening to the passionate    presentation by the lawyer, the judge banged his gavel declaring, "Case    dismissed!"          The lawyer immediately stood objecting to the ruling saying, "Your    honor, how can you possibly dismiss this case? The Christians have    Christmas, Easter and others. The Jews have Passover, Yom Kippur and    Hanukkah, yet my client and all    other atheists have no such holidays."          The judge leaned forward in his chair saying, "But you do. Your client,    counsel, is woefully ignorant."       The lawyer said, "Your Honor, we are unaware of any special observance or    holiday for atheists."          The judge said, "The calendar says April 1st is April Fools Day.    Psalm 14:1 states, 'The fool says in his heart, there is no God.'    Thus, it is the opinion of this court, that if your client says there is no    God, then he is a fool. Therefore, April 1st is his day. Court is    adjourned.       You gotta love a Judge that knows his scripture!

Cincinnatus      Primis annis rei publicae, Cincinnato consule, magna altercatio  inter patres et plebem evenit. Causa erat pecunia, qua paene tota plebs premebatur. Plebs auxilium a consulibus petivit, sed id non accepit. Tandem plebs ad Sacrum Montem secessit; patribus sola spes erat in concordia civium, et consilium ceperunt . Plebi creare suos magistratos, appellatos tribunos, permiserunt.      Eodem tempore, senatores eum remanere consulem voluerunt. Cincinnatus senatoribus dixit, "Plebs eosdem tribunos iterum et iterum legere cupiebat. Illis hanc potestatem cedere noluistis. Igitur, nunc vos non agere potestis id quod non permisistis; me consulem iterum creari non permittam." Alius consul factus est.      Post paucos annos, hostis exercitum Romanum cinxit. Hoc nuntiato, Cincinnatus consensu omnium dictator dictus est. Legati, a senatu missi, eum trans Tiberim agros colentem invenerunt. Cincinnatus uxorem togam ferre iussit. Tum, apte vestitus, ad urbem processit, celeriter exercitum liberavit, hostes sub iugum misit. Ad agrum rediit, et dictaturam sex menses acceptam sexto decimo die deposuit.

20090220114454AA2hNoE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this a spiritual gift?	I got saved a few years ago. I'm still growing in my walk with God. As I have grown I have had weird things happening to me. One example, is that one day, I had a girl come over to my house to babysit my kids for me. She was at my house quite often helping me with the kids. Me and her are really close. One night she came to babysit and I sensed something about her that was different. She was not acting any differently or anything. Just the same as she always is. It was like I could just see right through her into her soul. My husband and I got into the car to leave, and I told my husband, that something was not right with her. I told my husband that I felt like she was going to steal something from me..My husband told me it was in my head, so I said yeah, your probably right. We came back home after going out for a bit, and I brought the babysitter home. Fast forward two days later, I was looking for my expensive digital camera and could not find it. When I called her house and spoke to her father, I told him I was missing my camera and asked if he had seen it. Her father told me, yes. Come to find out she lied to her father and said she bought it. When I asked to talk to her on the phone, her father told me she was not there. I asked where she was, and he told me she was in the hospital for trying to committ suicide. I think I have a spiritual gift because I have had a few incidence like this happen at other times. Why is it that at times, I know something about a person, without them even telling me?? Serious answers please from devoted christians. Thank you.

20090220122143AA4y5ra	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you believe in Destiny and if you don't would you believe after what I have to say?	First of all, we all have a destiny here on Earth and I bet you never thought about it before, it's called, are you ready?  DEATH!  If you don't believe in destiny then why do you think we were placed here to begin with?  Birth was our first destiny and then death is second.  So if you're reading this then you have a destiny called DEATH!  Destiny is something we can't change no matter what and since Death is something we can't change, it's simply a destiny given to us by nature.        Now here's the tricky question, since we now accept death as our destiny what about anything in between from birth to death?        Of course it's also destiny! The chair you are sitting in and the computer you are typing in and reading this was all created by destiny, meaning that some how some one was given the knowledge to do and create such items as chairs, computers, cars, airplanes and etc...      If we were all born to be equal then we would wanted to be lawyers, doctors, scientist, pro-athelets and billionaires  but.....since destiny is within us we can't!  That's why we have janitors, construction workers, used car salesmen, criminals, and homeless people.        Just think if we were all born equal without destiny then we'd all look alike and all have same intelligence and this world of humanity wouldn't exist for too long because we'd all have self-destructed without ever inventing medicine, and other important things in life.        Now have I convinced you that Destiny is real?      Therefore, Free-will is also an illusion....

I'm 22 and going back to college on the 9th of this month, but i've also got tons of experience in the working world, lots of volunteer experience, including 7 years as a studio tech and 1 year management training. But the thing is i can't get a job anywhere, not i admit when i was a teen i had a job at fast food that did not go well and ended up with me quitting without two weeks notice. i have grown up a lot since then because i wasn't a mature adult then. But i feel so bad beacuse i'm 22 in college but don't have a job to speak of and its been this way since janurary of 2008 when i dropped out to get a full time job to pay the bills, but i couldn't get not one job. my will to live is diminishing quickly, i am so sick of filling out application after application and its not like i'm fresh out of high school for Gods sake i have 7 years as a studio Technician and references and people who can write letters of recommendations for me, but i cannot get hired even at a burger king. i know the economy is bad, but this is terrible...to be 22 and unemployed for one whole year depresses me to no end..    i don't know what to do, i'm so behind, i'm sick of trying to find work everyday, i'm sick of feeling like this    whats going on? am i doing something wrong? do i offend? do they not hire black people these days? do they think i'm gay?

I invited this woman who belongs to a playgroup I belong to over for dinner with her family and she accepted the invitation but seemed kind of mad about it. That evening she acted annoyed to be here and even made some mean comments. I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong, I wasn't trying to become her best friend or anything like that but she threw a baby-shower for me a few months ago and has invited me and my family over for a couple of holidays so I was just trying to reciprocate. Do you think a dinner invitation was too personal? We are not close but I thought it was a nice gesture. Thank you.

She took me to her elfin grot,      And there she wept, and sigh’d fill sore,         30   And there I shut her wild wild eyes      With kisses four.        IX.      And there she lulled me asleep,      And there I dream’d—Ah! woe betide!    The latest dream I ever dream’d         35     On the cold hill’s side.        X.

I saw their starved lips in the gloam,      With horrid warning gaped wide,    And I awoke and found me here,      On the cold hill’s side.        XII.      And this is why I sojourn here,         45     Alone and palely loitering,    Though the sedge is wither’d from the lake,      And no birds sing.

Not one time did I see anything positive or healthy for the human mind.      What I'm trying to say is nowadays the world seems to be getting way worse, Yes I heard many of people say "Oh don't worry about it, the world has always been like this" Bullshit! Nowadays you can't trust the food you eat, Suicides and Murder rates are at an all time high, and I read that our economy could end up way worse than the Great Depression, Korea is testing WOMD, Morals don't seem to exist.      I'm asking anyone who is willing to hear me out and give there feedback, but do you think our world has hope? or do you believe something major is about to happen?      I don't mean to preach to you guys, but I personally think things are about to get crazier now that Obama is in office...The weird thing is I voted for him.

20090220073831AAs5WB7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	R&S normals: Wallace v. Jaffree, 1985, what is your viewpoint on it?	In Zorach v. Clauson, 1952, The Supreme Court declared that Americans "are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. When the state encourages religious instruction  or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions. For it then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates public service to their spiritual needs."      Differing decisions handed down by the Court in the past 50 years, including the celebrated Lemon test of 1971, often seemed to contradict one another. The Court, like the country, struggled to achieve what journalist and commentator Fred Friendly called a "delicate balance" between religion and government.      Throughout the 1960's, case after case before the Court required a decision regarding the separation of religious activities from the public school systems. In its Engel, Schempp, and Murray decisions, the Court ordered schools to end Bible-reading, group prayer, or a time of prayer as an official part of the school day. A storm of protests followed these decisions, while many school districts substituted "moment of silence" for previous religious activities.      Those who objected to the "wall of separation" challenged the court. The Establishment Clause, they argued, was intended only to prevent the establishment of a State Church such as the Church of England. "The intent of the Framers"-as a point argued before the Court- became a significant question in Wallace v. Jaffree.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...   I am on a neutral standpoint on this topic, But I am interested in the opinions of those who take the time to read this.       How has this affected the governments policy of separation of church and state?      Can you think of any more controversial issues past the introduction of Evolution in the Classrooms?

20090220065320AAFunEO	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: Are Muslim people generally more or less racist than Christians?	I have seen a lot of discrimination and hypocrisy performed by the Christian church, and I think that is what is turning a lot of young Christians to Islam.   Do you think that Muslims are more or less racist than Christians?   I'm asking this because I do not want to be branded by my race.   If I go to a Mosque or area with a lot of Muslims with a burka or hijab (I am not totally Muslim yet) would I be asked what my race is?   Sorry for the confusion. I really want to revert to Islam. I said the Shabaha (spelling?) and am consulting with a Muslim from a Mosque on tuesday.

20090220073505AAsqlWw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Catholics, have you found that putting your trust in God has alleviated much of your worries?	Worries of everyday life can be overwhelming, whether it is family, finances, health, etc. I think we all can agree that sometimes life is just out of our hands and that we cannot plan everything. I find that simply relying on God and trusting in Him as Our Father relieves a load of worries. I'm not saying sit back and not do anything, because I also believe that God helps those who help themselves. Have you found that putting your life in God's hands (especially in times of sorrow) gives you a sense of security and a lighter look at life?

So i'm a Christian, and i had never heard of free masonry until a couple of years after i started going to church.      I have heard that they worship Lucifer but that they don't know it until they are up into the higher stages of "the craft", that they have to call down awful curses on their family and loved ones should they tell a soul anything about the rituals of the craft, that there is a very very high incidence of physical and mental sicknesses among freemasons and their families and proceeding generations, and that it is a generational curse that is very hard to break.      I have heard this from Christians, but is this really true? There's out there stuff that some Christians beleive about end times as well, is this stuff up there with that?      I just want objective and proven information about it.      ETA:      Oh, and that there's also a secret handshake and that the guys look out for eachother, even above the law, that they're planning to take over the world by means of a 'new world order', that the parliament house etc in Australia (my country) is set out in a five star pentagon thing which is a freemasonry thing because 11 of our first 13 governer generals were freemasons, that heaps of our politicians are freemasons and that it creates factions and corruptions in parliament and the running of the country.

In the course of a day, I am a killer, I admit it.      I gargle with Listerine?, sending millions upon millions of bacteria to their deaths.        I excrete my body's waste products, dooming millions more to a gloomy existence in the festering muck of a sanitation plant run by the local utility company.      Whenever I walk out into the bright sunlight, viruses as well as bacteria are impinged by ultraviolet radiation, eradicating them mercilessly.      Through my actions, direct or indirect, I have slain countless creatures of God in my relatively short time on this earth.  In many cases, although I probably could've prevented these deaths, I chose the path of convenience.      Will God forgive me if I am sufficiently penitent?  Would I need to do some sort of penance, like leave some of my lunch out for bacteria to swarm upon and feast or rinse my mouth with sugar water instead of alcohol?

He ordered genocide, infanticide, plagues, killed his own people (including Moses), etc. So according to the Trinitarian Christians, since Jesus is also God then, Jesus did all these things. Jesus is a vengeful, jealous, murdering God. But appeared to change his ways in the New Testament (God is said to never change). So Trinitarians, how do you reconcile these issues?

I DON'T WANT TO HAVE MUSLIM BASHING BASHING ANSWERS!      ...I just read something about some rapes involving Muslim men against non-Muslim women (Australia, 2000)      A cleric suggested that it was the fault of the women because they didn't wear hijabs.      One of the perps, in testimony, said that the women didn't have a right to say anything because...no hijab.      I'm not trying to debate the 'right/wrong' of the issue.      What I want to know is if any Muslim men agree that this rationalization, justified or not, implies that they [Muslim men] essentially lack any type/form of self control?      I just can't see how suggesting it's the women's fault because they didn't wear a hijab as being a...good argument to choose.      Now if she was a private dancer performing at a party and implied that she fantasized about 12 men...yada yada yada...then maybe there's a slim chance that someone could argue she was partially to blame. Emphasis on slim.      A woman walking to the beach from her hotel!?

20090220074051AA3IUBC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think Jesus has a sense of humor?	The gospel reading on February 15, 2009 was Mark 1:40-45      “A leper came to him begging him, and kneeling he said to him, “If you choose, you can make me clean.” Moved with pity, Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him and said to him, ‘I do choose. Be made clean!’ Immediately the leprosy left him. Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: See that you don't tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them. But the man went and spread the word, proclaiming to everyone what had happened. As a result, large crowds soon surrounded Jesus, and he couldn't publicly enter a town anywhere. He had to stay out in the secluded places, and people from everywhere kept coming to him”.      I love Jesus; he can be really funny. I chuckled silently because he had to have known that this man was going to tell EVERYONE and their mother about this healing! Did he really expect the man to be silent? Let’s discuss; God bless!
