cj7sSPZEaa	In the case you are referring to, the child had begun menstruating at 8 months of age and she was raped.    It is very rare for a girl to menstrate so young.  She had a hormonal disorder of the pituitary gland.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Yes I have heard of this before.  Like the first person said, I believe she had a problem with her pituitary glad that made her reach puberty very early.  She was originally from Peru or somewhere like that in South America.  You should be able to Google it.  This is not the norm however.  The average age for puberty is around 10 - 12.|`|tQGSMHhwaa	Wow your question is scary... um yea if she started her menstrual period at an earlier age and somehow got some sperm cells inside her then yea the little baby could get pregnant, but i don't think her tiny body would be able to with hold the weight and the body changes....why do you ask something like this?|`|52U22fiAaa	She can't.  It's only happened once in history but she had an extremely mature reproductive system.|`|vJ97L5FHaa	Premature menstruation/ovulation along with rape or incest.......This is very rare but I did read about it occuring.
Jo2DfRzaaa	i'm so sorry Amber.  <br>  I believe that kids are separate from adults.  I do not think that children should be tried as adults in the courts, no matter the crime.  there is a reason why a child committed such an act.  the goal is to find out why it happened.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	he should be placed in a mental institution, kids dont kill because they are evil..they kill because they are screwed up from abuse|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	act like an adult, get treated like an adult|`|046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	I would expect a child of eight to know the difference between right and wrong and anyone over that age who commits violent crimes should be tried as an adult. After all, if you commit an 'adult' crime then you must be prepared to do the 'adult' time.<br>  <br>  Aside from the fact that I find it ridiculous to believe he didn't know that shooting his stepmother would kill her (meaning he know exactly what he was doing), he is a danger to society. If he can kill at eleven without a second thought then what kind of a man will be be? And, quite frankly, this woman and her family deserve justice too, even if that means her eleven-year-old killer is jailed for forty odd years.<br>  <br>  The father should also be jailed for allowing his son to have a gun at such a young age. It's fine to teach a child to shoot but there is no good reason in the world why someone under eighteen should have free access to a gun, let alone own one themselves.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	he did the crime of an adult so he should be charged as such.|`|AA10943329	Charge him as an adult. Another reason to why kids should not own guns. He knew what the consequences of pulling that trigger would be. He has taken two lives and deserves to be charged as an adult. But also to blame is the adult who bought him the gun.|`|AA12221392	I think even at the age of 11, he is still a child, with a child's way of thinking. He should be tried as a minor. A child's brain and mental abilities aren't the same as a adult. <br>  If it was premated , then I am twisted, because he knew what he was going to do,and then planned it out. So who knows. <br>  <br>  I do beleive that a child should not have free access to a gun and bullets. yes, people do kill, but kids don't alwyas understand that if you shoot someone they die, they see tv, and sometimes the dead doesn't die. Sometimes they don't think like we do as the consquence for that act. Guns cause innocent people to die every year. They should ban all child guns or make parents register them and make sure the kids all have a saftery class for them. <br>  <br>  It is really sad that a mom is gone and a innocent baby as well.|`|OCMq6FTdaa	thats very sad but the kid is ELEVEN not an adult. We don't allow kids any rights to vote, drive, drink ect. because they aren't mature enough to make important desisions, but we hold them as acontable as an adult? Wow, we torture people, kill people, and try kids as adults, do will kill kids too now?|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	I don't think they shouldn't, people always say "children are not adults so they shouldn't be treated like it" that doesn't just apply to situations that benefit adults.<br>  <br>  People also say that children are not responsible and don't understand what they are doing and need mummy to make all of their decisions, again that doesn't just apply to the situation that people want it to be applied to.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	Act like an adult, get treated like one.  Besides, most studies show "re-forming" people doesn't actually work.  So if they use him just having a mental problem, and trial him as a child & do counseling  there's still a good chance he'll end up hurting someone again.  <br>  <br>  Its sad, but he'll probably end up in some prison with better food than we eat, cable TV, & a gym!  (You can tell I don't have much faith in our system)|`|b1mVjqfSaa	I am on the fence as far as him being tried as an adult since he is eleven...however, as reported, it seems to have been premeditated. In that case, I do not agree that this child only be placed in juvie until 21 in hope that he will recover from whatever, "something had to happen to make him do this" life, that is never a good enough reason for him to pick up a gun and kill. He deserves more. And on top of that, weapons do not kill people, people kill people. If the gun would have been hidden or locked away, then it could have been a knife, a hammer, or another item. Back to my point, him using his head to think of a plan and his hands to carry it out, would have killed one way or another if that was his only intention. And on top of that, to leave and act like it was another day and hop on the bus and head off to school...hmmm could this child be a sociopath? Only time will tell as we hear more details of the investigation...<br>  <br>  Sad, sad, tragedy...may that mother and daughter rest in peace and receive the justice they are entitled to.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Well, he shouldn't have shot her, but he's 11! I'd say put him in a child's jail. It really isn't all his fault. His parents should have taught him that. Where'd he even get the gun?|`|KUxEBQuYaa	if they think they can act like adults, then they should be treated as such. like the girls who beat up that other girl while filming it. and so on.|`|140d2cb6f23e38d9b4af65f92993c60faa	This kid deserves to be tried as an adult.  If it was just an accident, then they can let him slide.  However, this was not an accident.  It seems the kid knew what he was doing--he even tried covering it up by acting like nothing had happened.<br>  <br>  However, the parents are also to be blamed for not raising their son properly/paying attention to the signs that he was dissatsified/letting me be around guns in the first place.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	Unfortunately, he is a child and thinks like a child - so he should be charged as a minor. he obviously has some heavy duty problems, but he is not completely responsible for what he did because children aren't able to grasp the reality of their choices and actions. that is why they cannot be legally considered adult until age 18. This is also why young girls think it's "cute" to have babies. Their brains are not fully developed yet. Not that this boy should get a slap on the wrist, but he needs to be placed in a juvenile detention center until age 21 with intensive psychiatric intervention. and hopefully they can get to the root of his problems so that he might be able to live functionally in society again. so sad.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	They have to go through a process to figure out if they should be charged as an adult or not.  Personally I think that kid should be tried as an adult.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	how sad, why the hell did an 11 yr old boy have open access to a firearm and ammunition? "A child's 12 gauge" a child's gun sets off pop caps not 12 gauge shells. If this was a premeditated attack then yes he needs to be sentenced as an adult and there should also be something done about the fact that he had access to the weapon in the first place. If it's within the law to have an unsecured firearm in a child's room in Pa then something needs to be done about the law my god haven't they ever heard of a trigger lock or better yet a gun cabinet and a trigger lock. Completely senseless and avoidable tragedy.

7rIAd6gGaa	I wish there was something you could do. I tried everything (except castor oil because it's not safe for the baby), and none of it worked.

Of course, after a week or in some cases less, the doctor may decide to induce labor.  Hang in there, I'm sure by this time next week -- baby will be here.|`|hSQIv8Araa	To kick start labor you can:<br>  <br>  1. Have sex<br>  2. Walk a lot!<br>  3.

You're baby might like just staying in your belly, it will probably be never this "close" to you again XD.

It helps a lot with teething pain.|`|sbeoF50gaa	I like tylenol as IBprofen can upset stomachs|`|gPg7qYGIaa	bonjela|`|LiUvP42qaa	Motrin works best for pain, also try the Hylands teething tablets.

Iu0AJDviaa	First of all stop teasing him with the ice-cream,when your baby see it of course he wont want to eat propper food.Don't even have it in your house.<br>  Start early in the morning when you know your baby is at his hungriest and give him cereal,he will eventually eat.<br>  Good luck.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	You just have to keep trying. He will get hungry to the point he will eat again. There isn't really much you can do.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Don't give him any ice cream at all.  Babies are smart, ice cream is good.  Hell, I'd cry if I knew someone would give me a spoonful of ice cream every time.<br>  <br>  No more ice cream, just baby food.  He won't starve himself.|`|zezIM9B5aa	Same thing happened to my son. He refused to eat anything but two foods for 3 weeks. I kept introducing the healthy foods and stuck with it. When he threw a fit, I acted like it wasn't a big deal. I found the more frustrated I got, the less likely he was to eat the food I had prepared for him. Just give it time and keep the ice cream away. He'll eat when he's hungry.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	just give him his regular food. if he doesn't want to eat it then let him go about his day. he'll eventually get hungry and eat his normal food. stop giving him ice cream when he wants it. just because he got it one time doesn't mean you need to keep giving it to him.<br>  <br>  make him eat or just don't give him anything. he'll eventually eat something.|`|T389Yzi3aa	at 10 mos - he might have really liked the COLD because of teething issues.<br>  <br>  Maybe give him frozen carrots or frozen celery to chew for the "cold" <br>  <br>  and as far as hunger........when he's hungry enough......he'll eat  :-)|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	no more ice cream!!!!!!<br>  he will eventually eat the baby food!|`|oo7p1Etyaa	Your baby shouldn't have ice cream yet, the dairy can upset his stomach. Babies shouldn't have dairy until they are a year old.<br>  <br>  But do not give him the ice cream NO MATTER WHAT, when he is hungry, he will eat his food. If he spits it out, put some more back in. You cannot give in and give him ice cream just because he is hungry and wont eat his food, there is no nutrition for him in there.|`|L0EKlaZ8aa	my ped told me if they refuse to eat baby food maybe its time to start to give them table foods in small porptions and little bites so they dont choke the only reason they eat baby food is they know no diffrence beucase they never had table food before now that he has had something that is acutally good he wants more, so maybe he needs more filling foods u know babies do grow up, if he does get hungry enough he will eat the baby food but why force him to get just try a bunch of stuff that u think he will like untill he eats it.|`|PAC7aoBfaa	Maybe this is mean but if he's hungry enough then he'll eat the baby food. Don't let him have any ice cream at all.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	he eat it if he's hungry just don't give him ice cream at all
DKqsFGymaa	That is so sweet of you.  Most people don't think to give a gift when they leave, even when they are happy with the care their child received.<br>  <br>  I'm sure anything you give will be much appreciated.  Check out the site below for a list of nice gifts to buy a daycare provider:|`|2T9RXxNTaa	make a home made gift with your little one|`|58YiE4pFaa	what weve always done is given something like a bouquet of flowers, or a nice picture frame. not a single frame, but a decorated chrome-like frame design, and can display multiple pictures like an album. buy them something nice but not too personal, unless you know them well. and something that might not be the best sounding gift but always well appreciated for its practicality would be a gift card to like, target or macys. many teachers and daycare providers do not receive the highest salary, so giving them something practical works too.
sbeoF50gaa	I was told early on "do not let your kid sleep in your bed" so I followed that rule and never had this problem. BUT the best thing you can do is put him in his crib and leave him there. I know that's hard and sounds mean but he's only crying because he's not getting his way. He's not in pain, nothings wrong with him, he's just not getting what he wants. Maybe at first put the TV on for him to watch noggin or something. But don't make this into a habbit as the TV can make for bad sleepless nights for your child. But it might keep him quiet and he might fall asleep on his own.<br>  <br>  Oh yes the others are right as well, you COULD stay with him until he falls asleep, but then he will expect that every night and your next question will be "how can I get my son to go to sleep on his own"  :)|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	We co-slept with our middle child until he was about 2 1/2 adn with his baby sister until she was a few months old...it was just NOT her thing and needed her own space. It was not a bad habit nor a mistake.<br>  But, if you feel it is time here is what we are doing...<br>  Put up his crib or toddler bed between your bed and the wall, or otherwise up against your bed. This way he feels he is still there with you but everyone has their own space. eventually move him across the room and then further out into his own room.<br>  Sleeping and changes in a child sleep situations should not be a traumatic event. Make it a gradual transition, you will both be happier and have the same end result...plus your child will still know you are there for him instead of to ignore his cries :)|`|GE0Qb3iwaa	stay with him while hes there<br>  make the crib seem like a fun place he wants to be in<br>  include his toys there (take them out when he falls asleep)|`|YT1FfANKaa	I wish I would have tried the cry it out method.  I have a daughter who is three.  I nursed her until she was 21 months.  She slept with us and we still have to lay down with her to get her to sleep.  Also we are so tired we most of the time fall asleep with her and she wakes in the middle of the night a time or two.  My suggestion would be nurse your son and put him in his crib if he wakes let him fuss for at least 15 min. then check on him and try again.  It will do you a world of good to try.  Don't let him sleep with you any more otherwise you will end up like us.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Children NEVER sleep in a bed with their parents!!!<br>  Place him in a crib, buy some sippy cups and stop nursing him.<br>  It sounds like you just want it to be easier on you but not the health of the kid.<br>  Make sure the crib is in a separate room, install a night light and play some calm soothing muisc.  Plus, make sure he has some of his favorite stuffed animals with him - just make sure it's pleasant for him.|`|Q6Bzggmpaa	This is an identical situation to me with both my children  and like you  I (and definately my husband) got to the point where we were keen to get them out of the habit. I used to feed them in my bed and when they fell asleep on the breast I would gradually put them down in their cot, edge away slowly and when they woke up take them into the spare room where they would spend the rest of the night. I love the bond we have and  wouldn't change it if I had my time again but I have to say it was a long and tiring process getting them out of it - but I did get there eventually. <br>  I tried the crying technique for one night and hated it. It set us back ages as my daughter freaked for ages after thinking I was going to leave her again. It upset me and upset her and felt really unnatural, so personally I would not recommend it, although I know it works for some people. I wanted to do a process where I took the hit and not them if you know what I mean.  I first of all got them off the breast as I realised that personally for as long as they were breast feeding they would want to comfort off me in the night (my daughter was 11 months, my son 18 months).My son was a bit easier because before getting him off the breast I introduced a bottle (my daughter never would have a bottle). It was at this stage that I took the sides off the cot and put a bed guard on the side so they wouldn't fall out and bought my son some Thomas bedding (this was his own 'big boy' bed). I then gave him his bottle with me next to him till he went to sleep. I then crept away (putting up the bed guard). Every time he woke up (ignoring any little whimpers as sometimes he resettled) I would go into his room and then re-settle him with the lights off, minimum of noise. At first I would do this by cuddling him and giving him bottles, but gradually over a period of weeks I would reduce the contact, sitting at the end of the bed then on a chair and I would not talk or put any light on. After time, he just naturally started to sleep for longer on his own. When occasionally  he walked into our room to find me I would just say no firmly and take him straight back to bed (without cuddles) and just basically never give in.  I had set backs when he was ill but got there in the end with a lot of patience. Good luck.

If you see a doctor who is only a gynecologist they may not be certified to give you proper prenatal care or deliver your baby.

She ruined my hair herself when I was in the 6th grade.<br>  <br>  But, maybe if you earned some money and saved up half the money, she would let you do it.  They really charge in those fancy hair salons.  I pay $45 just for a cut and style alone and I have thin straight hair.|`|CvahPOtNaa	ummm...<br>  <br>  if you try talking to her and just explain that WHY you need it and show like before and after pics (if possible) of what your hair would look like with a perm.! Also maybe you can earn the money and show her that you have enough money also. And lastly you can maybe set a goal i.e. that u would get all A's in school in order to have a perm or you will keep your room clean or just doing extra chores s you have some possibilites.<br>  <br>  Good Luckk|`|UNyG5Iw2aa	I am assuming that you are old enough to walk into a salon and enquire. If not, you can call and enquire. Give them all of the reasons that your mother says against perming Your hair and then explain what your hair is like. Perhaps, you will walk away with some good information that could help your mom accept your point of view. Win her over with facts.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Just say... "Mom which haircut should I get - a perm or a mohawk? You decide!" lol. Take her with you to see a hairdresser, and ask what they have to say about the condition of your hair. If they think a perm is possible, then hopefully they should be able to explain to your mom how you can do it and also keep your hair healthy. <br>  Good luck! :-)
HW89eJEZaa	you will almost always get 2 lines on those test, the ones you need to watch for are the ones that the test line is as dark or darker than the ref line. read the box to determine the test line from the ref line, i dont remember which is which.when you get a positive one (as dark or darker) then you should ovulate within 24-36 hours.|`|bWyKAFwuaa	often answer produces test strips with a line ALMOST as dark as the test line...I just got my positive today with answer!

OLW0Irbhaa	I had one with my first, diagnosed at 7 weeks.  It resolved within just a few weeks but it was scary.  They should monitor you closely to make sure it doesn't continue to get bigger.  Some resolve and other continue to cause bleeding the entire pregnancy.

CVdcrY3kaa	Solids aren't recommended by most doctors until 6 months. The earliest any doctors recommend starting is 4 months, and besides, it's a myth that solids make a baby sleep longer. It's normal for a babies sleeping pattern to change from time to time though.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I'm not sure what you mean by wean.  You say she's bottle feeding.  What do you mean is it too early to wean.  Normally weaning refers to stopping breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  Are you suggesting stopping formula and just giving solids?  That would not be realistic.  An infant's primary nutrition in the first year should be breastmilk or formula.  They can not get the nutrition they need from solids alone in the first year.  Their bodies are not ready to handle it.  The solids they do get in the first year is to supplement the breastmilk or formula and it practice for when they do eat only solids.<br>  <br>  Babies do regress in their sleeping habits when they are teething, learning new skills, etc.|`|Iu0AJDviaa	That is one of the signs of starting to feed solids,however it could just be teething as you said,get some bonjella first and see if it helps.They can start teething(get all the signs,red cheeks, grizzling,fever,dribbling) but teeth may not show for for months afterwards,or you could wake up one day net week and see she has a mouth full.<br>  <br>  I started feeding my son at 6 weeks on medical advice as the bottles wern't right for him.<br>  <br>  My last daughter has just started eating solids and she is almost 4 months old.|`|FW9wiJ77aa	She is probably growing and requires more feedings. Starting cereal and such isn't going to make a baby sleep better. My daughter is 5 months and still wakes up occasionally to drink a bottle or for a diaper change. If she is not getting enough feedings during the day she will wake up in the night. Babies cry for a reason. Babies do teethe before teeth show up. Just them forming under the gums is painful. Signs are usually a lot of drooling, sticking hands in mouth, gumming nipple or anything they can get in their mouth.|`|oo7p1Etyaa	She might be going to through a growth spurt. You CAN wean her now, but I wouldn't. It is actually MUCH easier to breastfeed your baby when she keeps waking up, than it is to bottle feed. Because when you bottle feed, you wake up more, which takes more time to go back to sleep. You can lay down and breastfeed her. If you move alot, just don't fall asleep, if you are able to stay still then it will be fine. My son co-sleeped with me for a while. But then I would put him in his bed and when he woke up I would bring him to my bed. You get more sleep that way.<br>  I started giving my son solids (rice then vegetables) about 3 months, his pediatrician said that it was alright, as long as it didn't make him fussy it was fine. He is now 6 months old and eats stage 3 foods and meat. I am also still breastfeeding him.<br>  <br>  I thought my son was teething at that age as well, but he wasn't he was just drooling A LOT! Why do you think it might be teething? Like what is she doing?|`|Nh1ZZz89aa	At 3 mos, it is much too early to wean. Giving her regular food now could lead to food allergies. In another month you may want to check with the doctor about feeding rice cereal, but some babies may not have the swallowing abilities until about 6 mos or so, but if she is getting hungry, she may be ready at about 4-5 mos.<br>  Maybe she is crying because the formula is not enough. <br>  Is she drooling or pulling at her ears? Those could be signs of teething. Usually doesnt happen until about 6 months, but each baby is different, and it is possible. Good luck.|`|phgfj3F1aa	Okay, to the person before me, no, you don't give a newborn baby cereal to make him or her sleep longer. Why did you have a baby if you weren't going to take care of him or her? Night feedings are part of having a newborn.<br>  <br>  My daughter slept through the night starting at three weeks. Then she went through a week of waking up every two hours. Now she's back to sleeping through the night. Babies are not on a set schedule.<br>  <br>  Try offering her more formula during the day. Her calorie needs may have raised, so she's no longer meeting her calorie requirements through out the day to allow her to sleep all night.  And if you mean is it to early to wean off of the bottle - YES! Even after she starts eating sold foods, she should stay on formula for at least 9 to 12 months. And 3 and a half months is too early for solids anyway.|`|voj4H6Fpaa	as a baby gets older and more socially aware, they will want to wake more, and spend more time with you, so that could be one of the causes of the more frequent wakings. also, babies do go thru growth spurts, which could be the reason why she is waking and wanting more feedings. and that could be why she is crying, she may be hungry. babies need breast milk or formula as the primary source of nutrition until at least 6 months of age. if she wants more feedings, i would go along with her cues. if she's teething, she would be drooling a lot, and gnawing on whatever she could get her hands on. you would also see that her gums are red and swollen, and may see white peeking through underneath. most babies do not teeth that early, though it could be possible. if she is crying non stop i would bring her to her doctor. an ear infection could also be causing the crying and waking at night.|`|cN4ZNeUlaa	More and likely if she is crying its because she is either, hungry,needs to be changed or is somewhat gassy. try to burp the baby a couple of times during feeding this helps with gas. Theres no need to wean yet. Try to increase her amount by an ounce  or two. all babys are diff in the amount inwhich they eat. you still have a few mnths before theething...signs consist of them drooling and placing items in mouth to chew on,and diareah|`|7r6rS54Oaa	Here's a guide that is helpful:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thenewparentsguide.com/baby-teething.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenewparentsguide.com/baby-t...</a><br>  <br>  I think she is probably teething from the behavior changes alone.  When my daughter was teething I took some of her baby washcloths and dampened them with water then froze them for her to chew on.  You could also try teethers though my daughter never would use them.  Baby Orajel also works wonders and infant tyenol will definitely help.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Of course she is still to young.  You are a parent waking up in the middle of the night comes with parenting.<br>  Signs of teething are drooling more and teeth coming in. There are more, but those are the main symptoms.

Good luck and hope that the clomid worked for you.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Those can all be signs of hyper-stimulated ovaries, which your dr already confirmed you had. Sex this cycle runs you the "risk" of a high order multiple pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  **eta**Do not waste your money on a pregnancy test. if you had not ovulated on day 11 and this is 15.....NOTHING will show. Best of luck to you.|`|ZXDKEe5laa	Be careful you could have fluid in your ovaries that happened to me I had back pain and was peeing alot from the pressure of the fluid I didn't take it again because of what happened the first time and I got pregnant by myself 2 months later I decided to take a break from taking temps etc and looky what happened lol.|`|ioTPGLRwaa	sounds like you have a great chance just hold off if you can!!!!i know it hard i tested today and am only 7dpo....i am on my 7th round of clomid i did get pregant on the 4th round but lost it at 5w6d!!!good luck to us all!!!!sounds like you may not need luck tough!!!LOL
C55pji5Qaa	I can only speak from experience,but we saw heartbeats at 6 weeks and heard them at 8 weeks. You may only be around 4 or 5 weeks,don't not worry.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Yes that's normal.<br>  I had an ultrasound at 7 weeks and saw my baby very clear with a vaginal ultrasound. =)<br>  Good luck!|`|dDVAUA9saa	An ultrasound can't detect the heart beat until at least 6 weeks.  I had an ultrasound before I knew for sure I was pregnant (but I suspected) and I asked the technician how far along you would have to be for it to show up in the ultrasound and she said at least 6 weeks.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	With my last pregnancy and this one, I spotted around 6 weeks pregnant, so they gave me U/S. With my son, at 6 weeks, they found him and his heartbeat. I was 6 weeks, 5 days on Saturday and they found it and its heartbeat. <br>  Weird that they could find both of mine and not yours. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|1w41ReD7aa	I was 6 weeks&4days, I had my 1st ultrasound& I heard the heartbeat & I saw my little peanut&the sac? Thatss hella weird that you didn't see anything. Sorry girl, congradulations&goodluck (:|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	It is normal. Super skinny girls can see stuff around 5 weeks. Heavier girls can't really see much till about 8 weeks. Some doctors will do internal ultrasounds but it all depends on the particular doctor. No need to worry!|`|3vmynfzpaa	I have known quite a few women who have been told there is nothing there only to go a week later and see a thriving healthy baby. I wouldn't panic. You cannot see a baby on ultrasound until your hCG levels have topped 1,000, which is usually in the 6th week of pregnancy. If you are only 4 or 5 weeks pregnant you wouldn't be able to see anything. I would take their advice and maybe wait 2-3 weeks to have another scan done.|`|CJeufMTWaa	Try to stay calm because it is best for you and the baby to not stress out.  I know it's hard, but try.  It is true that at 4-6 weeks you may not be able to see anything.  Someone answered on here that you can't see or hear anything until 12 weeks and that is absolutely wrong.  With my first pregnancy I saw tissue at 6-7 weeks, but no heartbeat and then I miscarried.  I am now pregnant again (23 weeks now) and I saw my baby and his heartbeat at 7 weeks.  Do what you can to relax right now and go back at 8 weeks as suggested.  You will have a definite answer then.  Best of luck!|`|AOCwkR7caa	I work in a ObGyn office and usually at around 4-8 weeks you wont see anything. Most of the time you wont see a sac. You cant really see or hear anything untill around 12 weeks of gestation. 12 weeks is when you hear the heartbeat and when you are 20 weeks you can tell the sex of your baby/babies. Good luck! Dont worry yourself, if there was anything wrong then they would have told you right then and there!
E7R7D1onaa	I have also just miscarried this past Jan.. the same day as you and I have had my period... but my DR. said that it would be possible that i might skip the next month or so... Your body might still be healing for the stuff if just had to go through... miscarriage is the hardest thing to go through..  so good luck I hope all is well...|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	it is possible of you being pregnant again. i have known woman who miscarried and got pregnant right away.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Your child's medical records should have been transferred elsewhere when they closed.  Did you ever get notice of such?  If not, try a search in your local paper-they may have filed a notice of where the records would be.  Do you know anyone else that used that pediatrician?  If so, you can ask them if they know where the records are.<br>  <br>  If your child has been enrolled in daycare or public school, then a copy of his immunization records should be in his file.  Additionally, check the local health department-they MIGHT have a record as well.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Find out where they are storing the medical records to the place, they must store them!!!! It's the law!!! When you find out, go there and ask to the medical records to be given to you or forwarded to the new doctor! your new doctor may be able to help you with this process as well.|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	If they're 5+ (school-aged) or has been in daycare you probably gave them a copy of the records.|`|ztug2gLjaa	If your kids were in daycare they have records of that.  I have to send copies of there shots records to day care every year.  If not call the health department and they should lead you in the right direction.  Good luck!|`|gB86RtjIaa	Go to the local health department. Most state health departments keep track of the shot records for child.
OMyC0IJVaa	Because if filled with helium they can float, very cool. You can rub them on your head and stick them to a wall, again very cool. You can make them fly around a room by filling them and not tying them, very funny. You can make then make a high pitched squeaking noise and drive your parents crazy, to my kids very funny. You can pop them and scare someone and last but not least you can fill them with water and blast your friends/siblings and not get in trouble. Or in my kids case fill them with water and have fun in the bath during the winter.<br>  <br>  Can you tell we recently had 2 birthday parties with lots of balloons.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also since so many were popped at the 10 yr olds sleep over they are also a way to stop your dog from jumping on you and trying to eat your dinner and he does not even have to get in trouble you just hold one by you and he leaves you alone LOL. Of course they love him to death after dinner.|`|eISzHe5maa	Call me crazy but I was always kind of scared of balloons as a kid. I wasn't necessarily scared of the balloons itself, but the loud popping noise it makes. <br>  <br>  Even today when I expect someone would pop a balloon I still get a little freaked out. I like those birthday type balloons though.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	They are colorful and move in a way unique to everything else.<br>  <br>  I used to work in a party store-- watch a kid look at a moving balloon sometime.  They are mesmerized.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Because they can get so big but so light! And you can bounce them around, and float in the air and then you can grab it quick and throw it back up and it can go so far! It's just AMAZING!!!|`|8MmmvRlVaa	im not a kid, im 12 and im still fascinated by balloons lol.<br>  <br>  please answer:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiL8HJmLPO2rzaJoT9s3H4_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223153832AA4HS7c">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|prqrQcd1aa	I'm really not shure, but this question made me smile. I think it's maybe because they are in the sky further than the kids can be and they are shiny or just floating... maybe they just intrigue children because of that!|`|rOK7eJQtaa	SHut the F""" up! baloons are awesome.|`|ExbiiL18aa	Lots of colors! And the usually are used for celebrations, I don't know|`|CvahPOtNaa	ummm..<br>  <br>  Haha maybe cause they stick to stuff with electricity and kids can play with someting around thier size and i guess it flies up and down?? haha i dont really have an exat answerr|`|j2mRop0laa	They are weightless fun!<br>  <br>  We have a home video of youngest just staring at a balloon floating above a vent for like 15 minutes. She actually sat there longer. She was about 2 at the time. LOL|`|1s3nddaYaa	my son gets excited cuz he thinks they sing, my mother got a singing balloon for her birthday and now he thinks they all sing. so he likes to sing|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I think it's the same theory with bubbles. What draws kids in? Maybe that they're circular, or very colorful. Often because they can drift off into space? I still am fascinated by bubbles (not balloons) to this day. Maybe it's the child still inside me?|`|5WP9rLTlaa	because they are so floaty and shiny and squeaky and fun!<br>  I still find them fascinating myself, they're like butterflies and there is something magical about them|`|vGxipYJnaa	I think it might be because they look so solid yet are so light. Usually solid colored, big things are heavy - but balloons aren't.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Because they drift out into space with nobody controlling them.  It's a miracle!
dXDLeHNZaa	Maybe you just don't like Emma, and you get bad vibes from her? I mean, I'd be freaked out if my friend was going into that kind of business if they were straight or lesbian. You're not a homophobe, you just didn't need to know as much. Don't worry about it!|`|T7Xn2SQyaa	JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH SOMEONES SEXUALITY DOESN'T MEAN YOUR HOMOPHOBIC.|`|PJ0aI0Dtaa	youu're not homophobe.|`|fmkwdNJyaa	not homophobe to me|`|vGxipYJnaa	Sounds to me that you generally just don't like Emma. I don't think it has much to do with her sexuality. These girls should probably learn to keep the intimate details of their sex lives to themselves though - that would gross anyone out (regardless of what sexual orientation the couple was).|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Doesn't sound like you are homophobic.  Perhaps a bit immature about the fact that different people have different kind of relationships, but I don't think (by the examples that you gave) that you are homophobic.  It just seems like you generally don't get along with Emma as well as you do with Chloe.  No big deal, it happens.
ZtuLKde8aa	You can't really flirt through texting. To flirt means to show emotion, something that texting cannot do or show very well, even with those smily faces.<br>  <br>  Realy life is always best, but talking on the caller could help.|`|I64JOuMKaa	" heeeys :) ! i miss you sooo much <3 we haven't talked in such a long timeee ): "<br>  <br>  " how comee we never talk anymore ): ! you're breaking my heart =P"<br>  <br>  " hahahaa aww , youu're so sweet <3"<br>  <br>  " daaammn , youur so funny =P <3 !

I honestly don't have the words to express how that makes me feel...|`|gaXUIduMaa	Was she implanted with two embryo's or fertilized eggs?  Usually it is fertilized eggs.  <br>  It is normal to implant with more eggs as the percentage is nowhere near 100%.  If they both take, the mother has the option of terminating one or even giving one up for adoption if they want.  That should have been explained to them and it surely would have been in the contract.  I agree that it is wrong and I can almost guarantee that it will be appealed and the award either overturned or reduced.|`|zezIM9B5aa	People are insane. They want to play God.

cY8DgJv5aa	$3 an hour?  It depends where you live.  I'd say that amount is a bit on the low end, especially for 10 solid hours a day.  Most people charge at least $5.  If this is a close friend though, then charging less is understandable.  I assume you are doing more than just simply watching the child.  You are most likely proving meals and such which cost money.  You may want to consider charging more.  Also, the age of the child makes a difference in how much you should be payed.  Call around and ask what the local daycares charge.  You can get a better idea of what you should be charging.|`|jf4UOCElaa	NO THATS ONLY A DOLLAR AN HOUR MAKE IT FIVE AND CHARGE THEM = 10 HOURS 3 NIGHT A WK 60 SOUNDS REASONABLE BUT ITS UP TO YOU|`|771a46b3a001f059eb7ca678c7061fbdaa	No way.

Try a lot of baby powder.  Or Vaseline??|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Pregnancy does funny things to women.  Ive not had this from pregnancy but have had it from exercise.  I would recommend talc powder or chaffing cream and keep the area hair free (waxing is the best way).  Your skin everywhere on your body will become extremely sensitive and be prone to itching, redness etc ever if you don't normally have skin problems.  Also. ALWAYS wear cotton undies and stay away from g-strings as this will rub and the area as well.  Bikini bottoms are the best.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	Try some A&D ointment on the sore area when you are at home resting/reading studying and when you go out put baby powder on the spots you typically chaff the most<br>  <br>  and no i have never experienced this but i would assume this would make you feel better|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Hmm, maybe you are just sweating more since your body temp is higher during pregnancy.

I'd like that one the best.|`|yNV2kRlbaa	These are all great names!!<br>  <br>  I would choose Julia, but just because I know a really fun girl named Julia (plus it's close to my name ;-)|`|wrdPBLq0aa	Isabella, I've always loved that name!|`|XT0sGJchaa	Julia =]|`|xypA3yZMaa	Isabella!!!!|`|lAYUkCivaa	Julia Emilia <br>  sounds really adorable! :)|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Personally I like All Three lol. I would probably go with Julia. :)|`|HdyEDmncaa	isabella and  julia you spell emilia like this amelia|`|JQFGSV3daa	Emilia that's so unheard of! unique... I like it|`|pZpMoJOhaa	JULIA love that name i plan on naming my kid that someday!
BzCYQlcuaa	well i know allot of women who get pregnant the second they are off there birth control, then other women take years to get pregnant after BC. when i got pregnant i took a home test and blood test and it was negative. then i went back 20 days later for another blood test and it was positive and i was 5 weeks ( they did a ultra sound) so you may not be showing up positive yet. just re-test in a week or so. you also may be late from the BC and not pregnancy. relax, god has a plan :)|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	It sounds like you are trying to get pregnant.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	it is definitely possible that you are pregnant. And the pregnancy test was unable to pick it up due to your levels.<br>  Definitely take a another test tomorow morning or the more day after no period the better.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|9hrJfhIIaa	I stopped taking my BC 9/18. Had a peroid a week late on 10/25, coceived 11/9. <br>  <br>  I didn't have a positive test until 8 days after my period should have been due.|`|sk46uigvaa	it can take the average couple a year or MORE to concieve.<br>  <br>  You have probably only Ovulated once at the very most since you've been off birth control! Thats only one chance you've had so far to get pregnant.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Test in the mornings, not at night.|`|VmdMG7Edaa	Sounds like it, but birth Control can affect your cycle, yes DEF retest when do, make sure its right after you get up in the morning your first trip to the bathroom. morning urine contains more hormones and the test can be more accurate|`|3vmynfzpaa	You could definitely be pregnant. I think I would retest. I do know that starting and stopping bc can mess up your cycles temporarily so that could be it too. I would test just to be sure though.|`|R5fe3CPPaa	When I got off my BC I missed my period for the first month. I swore I was pregnant but, it turns out it was just my body adjusting to being off BC.|`|caf50252033092f023c9a8b6fa7c0c34aa	I didn't get  + until I was 32 days past my period, very possible. I advise you to stay away for alcohol and and thing that could be harmful and wait it out. And continue to pursue the doctor. A lot of docs will blow you off if that think you will let them.<br>  <br>  good luck and let me know what happens.
chiFCUC5aa	my husbands business recently went under and if i wanted my kids to be able to see a doctor i needed to get assistance from the government, does that make us bad parents  absolutely not! That is what the service is intended for. People who NEED the help. My state now requires that you have insurance or you get fined or lose your tax refund so they have started a health insurance program that is on a sliding scale ..so basically they look at your income family size and bills and tell the family how much they can pay towards insurance....i think its a great idea because some health insurance is not affordable my neighbor pays $2500 a month for her families health insurance...thats more than my mortgage!!!! just because peopel have jobs doesnt always mean they can still afford the right amount of health insurance that is what public aid is for.|`|PdxMOlcaaa	Your not alone in this, many people have started out this way.  Some of us just like doing things the hard way.  You need to both just keep doing what you have to do and don't worry about what others say.  Struggles can make us grow and learn.  Love your family and keep your eye on your goals.  Save when you can and get what you need.|`|NrLcshCmaa	May not have been a smart decision on your part to have a baby, but that does not make you a bad parent. You seem like an honest hardworking family.<br>  <br>  Now who is a bad parent is that person on the news with octuplets.|`|9XjtEdEqaa	i think you are taking responsibility for your actions. it does not make you bad parents. i think you have grown up a lot lately and are making the best of the present situation. you are always going to be criticized for being so young and pregnant but just stay strong.|`|H47P8urEaa	im 17 and in a boat right next to yours.... i have a 3 month old, and i am not married yet... but we live together and are working and going to school and raising out daughter all by ourselves. yes it is true that we I need medi-cal for my daughter, but that is fine. thats why the state has special programs for people with low-incomes, so that their children can have health care.|`|nbSvz7tqaa	I kind of think it does make you irresponsible. That sounds a little harsh, but you at least have to admit that you made a stupid decision. You and your husband were both in school, and I assume that neither of you had a full-time job. You are not truly independent because you're renting a room from your parents.<br>  <br>  It seems pretty clear that you guys knew you weren't able to support yourselves and a baby, but you decided to have sex anyway. Even if you were using protection, you should have been prepared to deal with all possible outcomes on your own because it's your responsibility.<br>  <br>  The fact that you acted irresponsibly, however, does not make you a bad parent. At least you're trying to do what's best for your kid.|`|toGnRPwcaa	HELL NO, you pay taxes every year with your husband and the government sure as hell makes sure that they get there cut of your husbands paycheck before and after he gets it. SO to answer your question no your not a bad parent you are a smart parent because that is what the government set up public aid for. trust me i would much better like my tax money to go people like me who can some times be down and out instead of bailing out banks and big companys that will only hoard the money for there pockets.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	... husband at 17?.. well congrats, i hope that lasts for u!!  pregnant at 17, everyone looks at you the same whether you work or not.. im 21 and pregnant, i get looked at exactly the same & both my partner & i work - but the public eye cant see that - to them i just look young!!.  its what we do about it that makes a difference, no one is gunna know if your a bad mum or not u just have to prove it to yourself that your a great mum!.    im sorry to say but u are going to feel like this for a long time, until you look old enough in the public eye to actually be a responsible mum, no matter how hard u try people are always going to judge you so just make the most out of the situation & do the best job u can|`|OMyC0IJVaa	Well I also knew that my boyfriend/husband loved me and we would take care of our child but we still waited until we both had jobs and insurance to pay for the medical. It may be people say that because like my husband and I we are sinking in medical bills and busting our butts to pay it off. Not having a child regardless if we had insurance.<br>  <br>  That said my parents had us young and were great parents. I do not judge young parents but it is frustrating when we pay out $300.00 a month to different doctors and close to $500.00 for insurance and others just chance getting pregnant because of state aid. <br>  <br>  I commend you and your husband for working hard and not making your kids go without medical care, but it is defeating at times when we cannot buy what we need because we owe a lot to doctors because we waited to have kids.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	You are not a bad parent just because you are asking for help. It is good that you realize that you can not afford everything on your own.|`|BnpEoMD4aa	I'm on medicaid, 17, pregnant, and not working. I'm 35 weeks and in high school! There is absolutely no way I'd even think about trying to hold down a job right now. My child's health, my health, and my grades are my TOP priorities. If I don't get a high school diploma, it's going to be tough to get into a good college, and I am not going to some crappy community college, or take online courses. If I'm not properly educated, my child with not be properly educated. Not to mention, job opportunities will be much greater with a better college degree. Maybe my situation is different in the aspect that money isn't much of an issue. My family and the father's family are fairly well-to-do. Don't get me wrong. I think it's wonderful that you and your husband are working so hard. In your case, that's maybe all you can do. But don't say that someone is selfish for using public aid when you're in the exact same position.|`|fb1K9Jlwaa	I think you sound very responsible. Receiving aid does not make you a bad parent at all. There is nothing wrong with asking for help when you need it. In fact, a lot of people out there are really struggling because they don't want to sacrifice their pride by asking for help in these tough economic times.<br>  <br>  If anyone think you're a bad parent for getting help, they are just ignorant. Don't worry what people like that think of you.|`|ki3XY49daa	There are lots of people in this country who get financial aid of some sort because they simply do not want to work and then there are people who work as hard as they can and still need help.  You should never feel guilty about getting help if you need it.  I live in Kentucky.  The only way you can get insurance here is if you're a child or a pregnant woman.  It sucks.  It really sucks.  Just hang in there and do whatever you need to do to get the help you need.
UNyG5Iw2aa	Well, you sound very angry and you were deprived of one of your babies firsts. I understand that. That being said, hair grows back and if your baby's hair was beautiful before the cut, it will be beautiful again. As for getting back at your husband, "getting back" is never a good relationship builder. However, since he has made you so angry, he needs to know how you feel and why you feel the way you do. Don't let him brush you off.|`|oR3v2IUmaa	I don't think revenge is the answer.  It's just hair.  Your son's hair will grow back.  Take your son to get a "real" hair cut.  I do think you should talk to your husband about why he gave the hair cut himself and your feelings on him doing it.   If you are concerned that you did not get to keep a lock of his hair.....I have three kids and cannot tell you where their hair is at.|`|a7f3d8bf66bfd9fc1daac1814d6e6577aa	relax. he did not do a bad job intentionally. your son is his son too.<br>  his hair will grow back. suggest you forgive him. so you can let go of your bad feelings. unless you like feeling bad.  your son does not care at all. nor does anyone else on the planet. <br>  <br>  live you life with peace and harmony.|`|4WVUBnA6aa	Was he fooling around or was he trying his best? Had he ever given a haircut before? I think you’re being a bit hard on him. It will grow back.|`|Wf1mVDbYaa	WAIT UNTIL HE IS SLEEPING, POUR PETROL OVER HIM AND SET HIM ON FIRE|`|XPHdUpDKaa	SHAVE ALL OF HIS HAIR|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	tell him that your pissed off!!!!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Two wrongs don't make a right.  They just make two wrongs. <br>  <br>  This is your husband, your life partner, the person you are sharing your journey with.  If he hurt you, you need to honestly communicate your feelings of being disrespected, not valued, hurt until he understands.  Because he loves you and has chosen to share his life's journey with you, he will feel bad once he realizes that he made a mistake that hurt you, that left you not trusting him, that hurt his relationship with you.  <br>  <br>  If you do something to hurt him in return, instead of trying to repair the relationship, to connect again, to treat each other with trust and respect as life partners, then it won't repair.  It will just be more broken.|`|86oPkfzOaa	get divorce!|`|9EVcTnUWaa	IF you're married and you're thinking about getting back at your husband for something like that, I have to wonder if the two of you should be married to each other.  Getting even is something that children do not adults. Talk to him as an adult and than move on it's just hair which will grow back out.  I think that there is a lot more going on here than you're telling us.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Don't freak out, it was bound to happen sooner or later. <br>  Your husband probably thought it was a cute idea.<br>  His hair will grow back eventually. :-)|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	cut his hair while hes sleeping.  that should teach him a lesson.|`|prqrQcd1aa	shave his eye brow..just one of them...and only half off!
1ZGDnSX4aa	im 16 and have been in since pre K its tons of fun all we do is see movies and go out for food plus colleges love it. we never wear any outfits those they dont make the older girls wear outfits and most dont even own outfits. but troops can be hard to find for older girls, and we just raise money for trips were going to jamaic this summer! JOIN|`|nbSvz7tqaa	At fifteen, you'd be doing a lot more than just selling and eating cookies. Since you're older, you'd have a little more independence and say in what your troop does, but it really depends on the leader you get. Some leaders are really into the outdoors, others prefer to just keep the girls close to home, and others just let the girls take over the meetings.<br>  <br>  Cookie sales only last for a little while in spring. You'd probably be working on your Silver Award and then your Gold Award. The Silver Award is manageable for someone joining for the cookies, but the Gold Award takes a lot of hard work (and it's an independent project).  <br>  <br>  Also, around here, girls don't wear uniforms. They may order a vest or something to keep their troop number on, but other than that nobody wears a uniform. You'd be just as much of a weirdo wearing one as a Girl Scout as you would be wearing one as a non-Girl Scout.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to do some community service, then go ahead and join.|`|ZtuLKde8aa	Yes. Join for the cookies. Then when it's time to work, leave and quit. Then join again next year for more cookies and cute outfits!|`|I64JOuMKaa	girls scouts aren't only about the outfits and the cookies LOL.<br>  btw when you sell cookies, you gotta go either door to door or stand at the mall like a fool standing there hoping someone buys them and stand while people stare at you.<br>  <br>  girl scouts was pretty fun when I was in it, but sometimes it gets boring.<br>  You do lots of activities and you get badges and stuff and its nice to see your sash with lots of badges.<br>  <br>  oh and the cookies are DELICIOUS.<br>  <br>  and the outfit isn't all that great, but if you wanna join for more than the cookie and the outfits, and you like doing group activities and selling cookies then yeah go for it !
S5n5Za78aa	you should be fine my sis got pregnant on her second cycle|`|HclKftzAaa	i weighed 131kgs when i went to the obgyn. He diagnosed me with PCOS and put me on metformin and told me to lose weight. I lost 10kgs in 3 months. He was happy with this, so he prescribed provera to induce my period, and clomid to induce ovulation. <br>  <br>  My period didn't start off the provera because i had already ovulated and become pregnant on my own! :D<br>  <br>  It took us 2 yrs of TTC, and only 4 months since when i was diagnosed with PCOS.<br>  <br>  Metformin takes a while to build up in your system properly (which is why it's important not to miss any tablets). So it may not have had an effect on you last cycle.<br>  <br>  Hopefully it will start to kick in soon. If you don't ovulate this cycle, perhaps the doc will up your clomid?<br>  <br>  But just so you know, it CAN be done with PCOS and weight issues. Be prepared for gestational diabetes though, as you are at significantly increased risk of developing it. It's tough to deal with, but at least all the weight i've put on is just the baby.
lN0GkKgaaa	Well, I don't think I'd spank you. I don't believe in spanking and even if I did, I am assuming you are around 12 since your friend is 12, that is too old to be getting spanked.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I would probably be upset in the moment of it all happening, but I would have took you home, and then asked what was going on in there. Because you did not hold any matches in your hand, I can't assume that you were playing with them. So I'd ask you for your side of the story. I probably would tell you next time that happens to immediately come get me or any other adult. <br>  <br>  But no I would not punish you, or spank you for sitting there with nothing in your hand while they were playing with matches. And I am guessing you have not been put in that kind of situation before where you would think to immediately go get an adult.|`|vGxipYJnaa	I'm a mom of 3. I'd ask you about the situation first before punishing you. I wouldn't spank you because I think you're too old for that, and I don't use it as a punishment anyway. <br>  <br>  If you lied to me frequently, I'd be less inclined to believe you about what happened so you might get punished anyway. Sometimes moms make mistakes even when you're telling the truth. It's best to be as responsible and trustworthy as possible so your mother can just take your word for it no matter what the situation.<br>  <br>  EDIT - now that you've provided more details I would definitely punish you. You don't know if anyone could have died - what if there were oil or gas on the floor in the garage or something else that was flammable?? Five minutes is a long time - and you should be punished for sure!!|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Your Mom spanked u to teach u a lesson.<br>  I suspect she was scared half to death at the thought of how u could've been burned!!!! Be thankful she cares enough about u to teach you a lesson!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Would you rather your bum feel like it's on fire for a few seconds. Or your irresponsible friends accidentally set a part of you on fire?<br>  Take this in stride,and if you are around anyone doing anything questionable,know that you are guilty by association.|`|75TRCPx0aa	Yu didn't dp **** so why will Yu get in trouble **** DAT man Yu need to go tell your mama wat happen i am 16 Girl and i live in new orleans|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Of course spankings hurt and often make the kid cry, at the time.<br>  <br>  >i didn't light any matches. i just told them to open the window so our moms wouldn't smell the matches. but i didn't DO anything so i shouldn't get in trouble.<br>  <br>  You were aiding and abetting them; an accomplice. And you SHOULD have DONE something to stop them "playing with fire"; you didn't and so that is why all of you "got burned".<br>  <br>  Though I do think one spanking probably was sufficient ... should not have gotten another one after she got you home.<br>  <br>  >why should i get a spanking for NOT being a tattle tail? they were only lighting some old paper on fire, not any of the cans of stuff that were in there. it wasn't like anyone was going to die. i feel bad they got spanked but i shouldn't get spanked at all, right?<br>  <br>  Wrong. Your mom knows you.  And you say "they were ONLY lighting some old paper on fire". And the whole building could have been in flames in just a couple of minutes. Garage, gasoline, oil, grease?? That is a recipe for disaster.  Someone or several someones sure could have died!!<br>  .|`|h1lDGNp4aa	First of all I'm not your mom; I think spanking is a terrible way to punish a child.  It is demoralizing and teaches nothing.  There are far better and less abusive ways to teach a child a lesson.<br>  <br>  You are around 12?  If you were my child I would have quietly told you to come home and, once there, I would have told you that the responsible thing to do would have been to tell your friends to stop what they were doing and, if they didn't, to get me.  I would then have called their mother.  You did nothing wrong.<br>  <br>  If you had also been playing with the matches, I would still have spoken to you calmly.  I would NOT have spanked you but we would have had a talk about what could have happened if there had been a fire and I would have either taken away privileges (like watching TV) and/or grounded you for the school week.<br>  <br>  When my nephew Jon was seven, he and a friend actually did start a ground fire and my sister not only grounded him but she took him to a fire station and had a fireman talk to him.  <br>  <br>  I think physical punishment is useless & unnecessary.  It teaches nothing except it makes a child resentful and the parent loses the respect of the child.  Why wouldn't a parent want a respectful & loving child?  I imagine that that is how your grandparents treated your mother and your mother doesn't know that there are better and more effective ways to teach a child right and wrong and consequences.<br>  <br>  Now, if you ask this question again, ground yourself for one school week AND stay off the computer except to do homework.|`|ddYu1rrYaa	I don't agree with the spanking but if all you did was tell them to open a window so nothing could be smelled your mother did need to take action. She should make you write a report detailing why what happened was dangerous with statistics and a bibliography. you'll never make the same mistake again!|`|UNyG5Iw2aa	Well I answered this the last time you posted this question. Now it seems like you didn't like people siding with your mom and searching for the answer that you prefer. If all you got was a fifty-fifty split of opinions, then the coin is going to continue to land like that. Sorry to hear that you got in trouble. Next time, follow your safety rules.|`|IWzYB44raa	You all deserved to be spanked.  You could have burned yourselves to death.  Your mom cares about you and spanked you out of love and fear.   What if your hair or clothes caught fire and you were scarred for LIFE?!  By telling your friends to open the window to hide it from  both of your moms was WRONG.  Your mom was right to spank you.|`|LSJyE4d0aa	I know that it sucks to be a tattle tale, but you have to learn to use better judgment. It is better to be a tattle tale than to put you and them in a dangerous situation. In a way I am going to side with your mother, however, I do not think you deserved a spanking. The way she punishes is up to her though. Use better Judgment!!|`|WLynh3bCaa	It could have been dangerous, you don't know that "it wasn't like anyone was going to die". Someone could have gotten seriously injured. All three of you are very young, you don't know how to handle matches and you shouldn't be 'playing with them'. Besides, what motives or intentions could your friends have had? It's likely that they were ones that deserved punishment. Your mother loves you and doesn't want you to get hurt or start dealing with something you're too young to handle. Playing with matches can seem like nothing at first, but it can easily lead to something much less innocent.|`|faLD7RiVaa	There is a BIG difference in being a tattle-tell and being responsible. If your friends are out back cussing up a storm and giggling, telling on them at this point would be tattle-telling. If your friends decided it would be fun to put on their mom's make-up and you chose to tell, this would be tattle-telling. Tattle-telling, at least in my house, is someone telling on someone for breaking a trivial rule such as no cussing or not cleaning up a mess. In my house, if Junior saw his brothers or friends doing something NOT DANGEROUS OR ILLEGAL it is his obligation to bring it to their attention that what they are doing is wrong (ex: "Hey guys, we really aren't supposed to cuss. If we get caught we could get in trouble.") and leave it at that. Now if they were to, say, witness their friends playing w/fire which could lead to someone injured slightly, seriously injured, destroying property, torching a neighborhood, killing someone, or criminal charges, then my sons would be expected to tell.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	I don't really think it was necessary to spank you, because you wern't playing with them. I wouldn't of spanked you unitl i knew what was going on, i would of given you a chance to explain and then explained why you were getting a spanking. However, i think you should of been a bit more of a leader and told them to quit. Hopefully...maybe you will go and tell on them next time!<br>  <br>  Also, you seem to get spanked a lot?|`|1elv7oc5aa	If you were my child I would be thankful that you had enough since not to play with matches.  However, you not playing with the matches didn't take away the fact that it was very dangerous.  You should have at least told them not to do it and explained to them how dangerous it is and what their mom would do to them if she found out.  <br>  <br>  Also, if, when your older, your friend asks you to drive them to the bank and they run in and you sit in the car, if they rob the bank, even if you had no clue, you will be charged with robbing the bank just as well as them.  You will be looked at as an accomplice.  Just something to think about.|`|Dmnj4zw9aa	Hmm...<br>  <br>  My mom would have been more like, "What the heck are you doing...? Eh, don't burn yourself, or my yellow flowers!"<br>  <br>  God she love her yellow flowers. x]<br>  <br>  I'm not twelve, I'm fourteen, but my mother would have never done anything like that. She doesn't hit me. Spanked you? That would have been an excellent stop to use italics.<br>  <br>  That's weird. You're too old for that. So is your friend. The last time that happened, I was still stumbling around in diapers.<br>  <br>  So, eh, no. You're mom wasn't being fair. A good angry look and long, loud sentence about not doing it again would have worked. :]|`|pPKhVRXJaa	laying with matches is one of the few things that earns a child a pants-down spanking in my house, and that's exactly what you would've gotten from me young lady. your mom was absolutely right to spank you. i bet this isn't the first time she caught you doing something like this, and you were trying to help them hide the smell. be glad you only got what you did, if i were your mom i would pull down your pants and underpants and spank your behind until you couldn't sit. learn your lesson - don't ever play with matches!
9g5G2qWgaa	Sounds like the same thing you were going through last time you got your BFP...I'm hoping it is positive this time as well. It's good to see you on here again I just got back on myself, needed a break from everything trying to reduce my stress. But with my husband deploying in two months it doesn't give us much time to keep trying which is sad b/c I really wanted this to happen before he left.

94c4f613fc528ba3897114d516beee90aa	Yeah i think the best thing at this point is the test. really make sure to take it in the morning. Best result since you are still a bit aways from your period. I know this is all hard. I have had two rough years of trying so I think i might be getting pretty experianced with this...haha. I know that period and preg symtoms are just too close sometimes. Good luck though. I have baby dust for you.|`|X9ENYDLUaa	Hey hun, I know it's probably hard to hear this, but PMS Sx can be just like pregnancy Sx. I had months when I was SO SURE I was pregnant because I had every early preggo Sx out there, yet lo and behold AF showed up anyway. It made me feel like I couldn't trust my own body; so frustrating! So really, there isn't any way to know for sure until (1) you get a BFP! or (2) AF shows up.  I don't think there's anything wrong with having hope tho'!!<br>  And if you want to obsess over your Sx like many of us do, go to www.twoweekwait.com, which lists the early Sx of preggo women.<br>  ~*~*~Baby Dust to you!~*~*~
vAF4wgVDaa	go to the dollar store and get a couple tests. Like 2 or three. They work.<br>  <br>  You will probably not get a positive if you are, it is way to early. Wait a week or two. Take the test around the time of your period and you should get your results. In the mean time you just have to be patient.

2013075b963c70173a3dc732a3f43ecfaa	My husband has high numbers as well, slighty low motility, and VERY low morphology. They won't put me on clomid given the odds are slim it will make a difference right now. We are going to see a fertility specialist to see what the next step is. I know natural conception is slim (but not unlikely) and we may have to resort to a sperm wash (to isolate the good sperm) and IUI (injecting the sperm into the uterus manually).<br>  <br>  Same goes for you. The odds are lower, but there is always a possibility to conceive. And who knows? Maybe a repeat semen analysis will reveal better numbers! All it takes is one good sperm to meet that egg after all. Keep positive... but also keep realistic. You can get pregnant. It just might take some medical intervention if you find you have not succeeded after at least a year. Best wishes to you!
f6qbRAmvaa	its kicking bc its getting to the point to where its like a new born and just wait till u get close to ur 30 week omg mine kicks pretty hard sometimes it hurts and about the back its going to hurt more and more and more take some Tylenol good luck and congrats :)|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well the back pain and kicking are unrelated. Back pain is pretty common during pregnancy for several reasons. First, your joints all relax a bit due to a hormone called relaxing that is released during pregnancy. This puts more strain on tendons and ligaments. Also, your posture has to adjust as you get larger and carry more weight out front so you don't fall forward.<br>  <br>  You can try a heating pad for short periods of time, massage, chiropractic care, warm baths, tylenol, stretching/yoga and rest to try and help with the pain.|`|2osuEr0naa	i'm 24 weeks pregnant, and OMG my back hurts as well. It's only going to get worse i've been told. My baby is moving all the time. I'll wake up in the middle of the night and feel my whole stomic move. It's WEIRD! they get stronger and stronger every week it seems like. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy. :]|`|DcLiW4bbaa	Haha, welcome to late pregnancy! The first bits of being pregnant are nice, save for some morning sickness, then you hit the third trimester and BAM! sore back, swollen feet and hands, headaches, fatigue, lack of sleep, painful kicks in the ribs, etc...it all comes with the territory. You have at least 10 more weeks of this, good luck!!|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	Your back hurts because you are carrying a baby. That's a normal symptom of pregnancy. I doubt that you are having contractions, if thats what you think, because if you were, there's no way you would be here on the computer. <br>  <br>  Just try to stay off your feet if it's really bothering you.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Oh you will have a lot of that! Just your baby growing and where he/she is at can really hurt sometimes!<br>  I'm 36wks, and i have back pains like hell sometimes.<br>  What helps me is to get on all fours and arch my back back & forth. or you can buy a birth ball--- its wonderful! <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck && congrats.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Your gaining weight and it puts pressure on your back. It's part of being pregnant. I'm 29 weeks and my hips are starting to separate (yours will too) and it feels as if someone is pulling on my legs and they are out of socket. It's an annoying/dull achy pain. <br>  <br>  My back hurts too!|`|3vmynfzpaa	You probably popped! When your belly pops suddenly it really strains the back. I found that I was extremely uncomfortable around 27-28 weeks with all 3 of mine and then it got better after a few weeks. Your baby is growing and preparing to come out in only a few short weeks. Maybe get a prenatal massage or visit a chiropractor to help with the pain.|`|cn91FeWcaa	omg... my back is killing me to.... i read that its because every thing is shifting and the body is off center or whatever... the kicking i feel it too i dont might though... it is kinda annoying a night when im trying to hold my urine in though|`|3w7VztEWaa	Im 20 weeks and my back is throbbing constantly.|`|o43uZSDJaa	because thats what babies do when they grow? and you have all the extra weight your body is not used to carrying
308cb6bcf0531e27237a2cb393891091aa	My daughter was the same at 2 months as well. I would say around 3  months she liked her swing and her excersaucer to the point where I could walk away for 5 mins or so and she would be ok and more interested in her toys than mamma. Now I can leave her with her toys for about 20 mins.. and she still doesn't look for me. But I don't leave her in them for more than that..|`|tapFZBowaa	It does get better as they get older.  He doesn't know that you are in two separate bodies yet, so he has no idea how to be independent.  It is totally normal....the best thing I can tell you is the first 3 months are like boot camp, then it gets better and better.  (Although the first three months were tough for us, I wouldn't trade it for the world!)|`|pXSKSS3daa	For my son it wasn't until around 4-5 months. Then he started getting more interested in his toys.<br>  <br>  Your son sounds completely normal. At two months he may not have the abilities to self soothe or self entertain. I know it's hard but it should get better within the next few months.|`|PkWX9Ouwaa	Our son just turned 2 months old on Monday.  He likes to be held all the time too but I have found a couple of things that he likes.  One is a bright colored play gym that has all sorts of things hanging from it.  The other thing is Baby Einstein classical music DVDs.  We have Beethoven and Mozart and he loves to watch them.  I don't know who comes up with the crazy stuff on those videos but they work.<br>  <br>  Visit my blog www.lifeofanewdad.blogspot.com to see some of my other thoughts.  There is an article titled "What is a Play Gym" where I discuss how much I love that item.|`|AA11112019	my baby girl is 5 months old and i fould that by the middle of her 3rd month she became more interested in looking around but not til she was 4 months old did she start to play by herself with rattles/teethers and her excersaucer. at 2 months old they need to feel secure and their mommy is all they know, i dont think they are old enough to be a little independant.|`|ioZeveazaa	Try finding a play mat that has things that will attract his attention with lights, scrunchies, sounds etc. I recommend one of the baby einstein mats. They have all these things and if the baby gets distracted and interested in what is going on with the mat then you will have some free time. =)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	He is still young. Enjoy holding him. Once he can roll over and sit up and stuff he will be able to entertain himself more. For now he doesn't have much control of his hands and can't really do anything with toys... he needs you.<br>  <br>  Give it time. It gets easier.
c3a8e6eba5f645a3321e4fbda11975ecaa	He must like you if he gave you the time of day in the first place. Not sure why you told him he wasn't your type but just keep playing it off. Guys like a girl who plays hard to get. Just don't make it seem like your bothered by it. Give it time and he will be chasing after you. Good luck!|`|7d6dd82b91e1dfd178fa3a6b9f099633aa	i think he used 2 like u but he doesnt anymore b/c he isnt yur type but now he wants to be friends|`|90e60fec07151b5e72164350572b006aaa	Nope|`|bcca70f6f32b030a89edeebbeb6cc224aa	plz modify ur answr,and this time dont forget to mention ur sex,,,,,,,,,r u urself a male or female,,plz mention it,so it can be easy for others to help u|`|7aa872bfa4df250478da9b6ef9263d82aa	YES he likes u.

Dont sweat it!|`|8074b1c6f796deb8e49e3dbf7fe3a57eaa	well if you like him and you told him you didn't....then some of the blame is on you. even if you don't like him...u shouldn't expect him to tell u he likes u after u told him that ur not interested|`|AA11508537	of corse he likes like you look for the signs|`|a10e0639c901af721cbef7cf7c42ba9aaa	look at the signals he is sending you|`|dbf5ad83c3ed0dbbef28570c389d171daa	What I have learned is that when a man likes a woman he will go great lengths to have her!  If he is interested in you he will prove it by showing you.  Give him credit for being honest.  Most guys are not especially in this day and time we live in!|`|bbe2d73b2ccbb7a84eb6e9bc92afc3d7aa	Well if you like him and you may wanted to have something with him why did you tell him that he wasnt you type in the first place. maybe you should have said your not my type but im willing to try. he probably is just saying he likes someone else, first of all because he probably feels a little like embarressed, and second, maybe hes testing you to see if you get jealous and come crawling back saying that you do want to try something with him. talk to him about it, and if you really like him tell him you didnt mean it in a bad way and your willing to try something new. there is no harm in that. if it doesnt work, then it doesnt work, but theres not harm in trying. its called risk taking. im sure he does still like you, he just doesnt know what to do becaue it seems like you dont like him, when you told him that. hope i helped. good luck! :]|`|AA11542772	yea i think sooooo

Even my mother had instilled this in me.  If you want answers to questions, you can always call your local planned parenthood or clinic and they will talk with you.  You can even go to the library or book store and find a section on sexual developement or pregnancy.|`|56e8b32d370d5d8399e0e93c79865626aa	Yes you can get pregnant during your period.Many people do not realize this.

No matter how mature she seems, your daughter is still a kid and her judgment skills aren't like an adult. Plus, how much experience does she have with kids?

R9Z4twDWaa	Absolutely.  You and your husband need to decide if babysitting is service to be purchased or a service of love.  Once you settle that the rest is easy.  If it is a purchased service, I assume several possible candidates will be sought along with references and personal recommendations if possible for full or part time employment.  If grandma presently has a job, quitting to babysit might ill advised depending on your local economy.    Otherwise, I personally think grandma should only work part time.   It can be a squeeze financially, I Know.  Tell her its important that she be a part of baby's life.   Let her know grandmothers are special, not just surrogate parents, and you will teach him that. As for the milestones and the like, the pediatrician is the only one who counts and depending on the beginning the milestones don't mean much.  Read below.    <br>    <br>  We just had our first grand baby in Mar, 7 weeks early.  Six mos later his weight, cognition, eating, etc, completely blow  preemie  "milestones" off the charts. He appears to be at the full term milestones.  So much for  milestones.  The  preemie milestones, at least the physical ones have been thrown out.  Only time will tell otherwise.  We love him and don't give a darn.  I do understand your MILs fixation with milestones.  Its a real statement of concern regarding development which is completely out of our hands but which can be used to sound an alarm if as a bare minimum they are not met*.    <br>  <br>  The problem with family for full time babysitters is that you can't fire them.  although my MIL lived very close to me (4 blocks) we never considered it.  She would of have done it at the drop of a hat.<br>  <br>  Now that I'm a grandpa I better appreciate your MIL's side of the fence.

Also inform your MIL that times have changed and babies are learning at there own speed, my son is 9 months (in a week) and can walk while my best friends son walked at a year. some babies just catch on more faster than others. <br>  <br>   You are very lucky though to have her there trying to help i would let her watch your child for a month and see how things go. unfortunately my MIL is bi-polar and has never liked me so i wish i could have a MIL to be there for me and my son like you do. good luck with your decision and i hoped i helped|`|GJiDgQzuaa	your boyfriend needs to stand up to his mother for you

Here in Missouri it's called Medicaid, it may be the same if your in a different state.  You can then sign up for WIC (women, infant, children), that depends on your household income.  It's a part of the Medicaid program.  This is just a supplement to make sure that you get the appropriate nutrients needed for yourself and the baby you are carrying.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & God Bless|`|04775e92d412de904c97dc5307a78b56aa	medicaid|`|2bb997b80dd59ba0695d46069a0e41deaa	Look into "Healthy Kids", or "Healthy Families"; it's a form of medicaid for uninsured children and their caretakers.

In an INDIVIDUAL POLICY (as in one you have to find yourself and pay seperately), pregnancy is a pre-existing condition and you will be denied or will pay a higher price because you're high risk. <br>    How far along are you? Most doctors don't want to you to come in unless you are farther than 10 weeks along. Also, most doctors will set up a payment plan with you if you don't have insurance or for what your insurance won't cover. They can't deny you medical attention if you're pregnant, period. And depending on your income, you can qualify for WIC (Women, Infants and Children) and Medicaid. There's nothing wrong with applying. Good luck!|`|6e7c8fc44d0d9f829af57ac26fa2c4e5aa	Go to your local Human services Department. Most states will give you a medical card until your insurance kicks in.  Also there was a law passed in 1999, that health insurance cannot turn you down due to a pre-existing condition. <br>  If you are unable to get a medical card.  Check with your ob and see if you can set up payments for the 60 days that you have before your insurance kicks in.  Many OB's will not bill you if they know the insurance will be there, because they charge the insurance a flat rate for regular checkups expected during a normal pregnancy and only re-bill if you start having problems.  <br>  Congratulations on the news of a little one on the way.|`|AA11702604	You may be able to get medicad with your insurance not covering it.

I know that If you get on baby-love Medicaid they would go by how much you and your husband make every month.

Then you can slowly start flattening the blankets and such so he gets used to sleeping on a flatter surface. Continue to do this until you don't have to prop him up any longer. <br>  <br>  You could also try taking him out of his car seat if he's a heavy sleeper and putting him in his crib without it while he's still sleeping. He'll wake up later and probably cry but he will get used to it after a while.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sagjCRvKaa	Do you have a rocking chair, better get one. Rock him to sleep sitting up, then lay him down in his crib. If he wakes up, pick him up and assure him he is ok, then lay him down again. You may just have to let him cry it out, as hard as this may seem. Otherwise you will never get him to sleep in a bed. Glad he is ok, and good luck. Have lots of patience.|`|SY7E62pGaa	why don'tt you try taking out the fabric from the car seat and let him sleep with that in his crib. good luck|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	It seems your son has a routine, just not the one you want.<br>  <br>  He is so used to sleeping in the car seat it might take a few nights without much sleep to get him to stay in his crib.<br>  <br>  I learned this from Super Nanny and it is not my idea but it may work.<br>  <br>  At bedtime, put the car seat in a closet or in the car so your son cannot see it.<br>  <br>  Then, put him in his crib with something comforting such as a special blanket.<br>  <br>  When you put him in bed tell him good-night honey or whatever you call him.  Make sure he is laying down.  Walk away.<br>  <br>  If he proceeds to cry and stand up, go back in a second time, lay him down again, and say good-night.  That's all.  Just good-night.<br>  <br>  Every time after that, lay him down, say nothing, and leave the room.<br>  <br>  You might have to repeat this fifty times.  After the second good-night, you cannot talk to him at all.  Not even to comfort him.  Just lay him down.<br>  <br>  It will probably take a few nights of this but you are in control of the situation, not your son.  And he WILL fall asleep.  There is no choice for him.  He will be exhausted.  But he will not be hurt by this.<br>  <br>  Do this every night and you will get the results you want.  <br>  <br>  You are in control.  Not your son.
t0mb150gaa	No i think your mom is making the best choice for everyone involved. Your sister is  lucky to have a mom that wants to be a parent rather then her friend. Your sister being mad is natural..all teens get upset when they don't get there way but she needs to realize that your mom is just doing what is best for her physical and emotional well being and instilling morals and values that she should respect.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Of course your mom was right, that is a totally inappropriate scenario for your sister to even ask!|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Your mom was 100% in the right for saying no.

He did a terrible job as the new Joker. He look ugly, ridiculous, and lame. He is nothing more than a cheap Beetlejuice rip off. And not scary at all. He look like a deformed drug addict homeless bum with a really bad Joker makeup. What is up with that hideous scar, black circle around his eyes, and smear lipstick across his face? It just look stupid. Jack is the best Joker. Jack should haven gotten the Oscar for best supporting actor and not him.|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	if I had another boy, that would be one of the names I considered, so yes I love the name Heath.

So, we bought her a Rocking horse, tinkerbell plush chair, Dancing center, Digital art center, Big plush My little pony, and a baby doll...<br>  <br>  She has never hardly played with none of the toys we bought her for her 1st b-day! <br>  <br>  So, I found out she is more content with littlier things...She LOVES books- any kind of book with pictures, she LOVES small musical toys and she loves anything to do with pots and pans...<br>  <br>  So, I would recommend Books, Musical toys, educational toys, and play pots and pans....|`|p6AMoTs8aa	leap frog table<br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2293345" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a>|`|FHT6wsUpaa	We got her 2 small toys...the Leapfrog guitar, and a Fisher Price story book that sings and recites storybook rhymes. She's really into music, and likes toys that make noise the best. We also got her a couple of new books. Other than that, we just put some money in her savings account. She isn't all *that* interested in playing with toys yet, and this is probably the only year she won't know the difference. Good luck!|`|AA11579568	She's one, she won't remember anything you buy her.
y8HKAhBFaa	Claire Michaels would sound weird but<br>  i would choose the second and third.|`|NWEJdpocaa	I love Gemma Claire and Kristen Sophia...gooooorgeous!!!

I do love the name Sophia though!|`|NNki7qiFaa	I love Gemma Claire<br>  I don't like the names Kristen, Valerie or Michelle.<br>  Sophia is nice though.|`|DP48dIxhaa	I like them all.

IjBqgYk0aa	Maisy or Maisie and you probably could spell it Mazie.|`|NWEJdpocaa	I think the spelling Mazie is fine...easy to pronounce.<br>  There's also <br>  Maizie...Maisie|`|CMuL7XpKaa	MAISIE<br>  <br>  Meaning: Its source is margaron, a Greek name meaning "Pearl." <br>  <br>  Nickname For: Margaret <br>  <br>  Alternative Spellings: Mazie <br>  <br>  Popularity: The name Maisie ranked 3868th in popularity for females of all ages in a sample of the 1990 US Census. <br>  <br>  Though this name appears on the 1990 U.S. Census lists, it is used by only a small percentage of the general population.<br>  <br>  Narrative: This name came into use among English speakers by way of Latin (as Margarita) and Old French (as Marguerite). It has been closely identified with Scotland, to the point that one commentator has pronounced it ''the national Scottish female name.''<br>  <br>  However, in the late 20th century it has been most prominently borne by Englishwoman Margaret Thatcher, the United Kingdom's first female Prime Minister.|`|xglOR1bXaa	definately Mazie|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Maisie is the most common spelling.|`|ej51eWO7aa	maisy<br>  mazie<br>  mazi<br>  mazee<br>  mazey<br>  maziy<br>  maze<br>  mazy<br>  mayzee<br>  mayzie<br>  maysi<br>  mayzee<br>  maysey<br>  maysiy<br>  maysy|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	I love how you spelled it with a "z"...Mazie, its adorable :o)|`|dwOLnFnlaa	Maize or Maise probably.

vmWEm4Jzaa	ask them nicely not to or take the baby away from the smoke|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Well, my grandma smokes. She's very old and on a breathing machine. She's set in her ways and in no desire to quit. She smoked around all of us and nothing came of it. I don't live with her, and it's disrespectful for me to ask her not to. My baby will be fine the once a week visits to her home.|`|bo4MguzVaa	It depends on who they are and where I am at.<br>  <br>  I would explain it is harmful for a baby's developing lungs to be around it and if they are at your house, i would ask them to put it out or leave.  If you are at their house, then I would ask them to put it out or you will need to leave.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, I'm gonna have to deal with this one too (im preggers), my parents in law smoke in their house and everywhere.|`|ynjgq4GZaa	i'd consider removing the baby from the situation, but in all honesty, i grew up with smokers and i don't think it's as big a deal as people make it out to be, especially if it's occasional.|`|tLcOikV8aa	I would say  "Stop smoking in a kid friendly place! Go smoke in a casino or something!" And then I would walk away with my baby. Or I would leave the area or cover up my babies mouth when I walk by.

It's a nice name.|`|ZCT2mKmaaa	noo|`|81nGin29aa	My college radio/TV-broadcasting teacher is called Wade.  A FaceBook friend of mine (whose first and last names are the same as his uncle) has Wade as his middle name.  Then there's Wade from the Disney Channel show "Kim Possible."<br>  <br>  As for Charles as a middle name, I just hope it goes with well with your probable two-syllable last name when Wade's the first.|`|y8HKAhBFaa	Wade seems like an interesting name. It doesnt seem ABNORMAL my name is UNUSUAL from my mother tho... I would love that name of a child Wade sounds like a strong athletic and Wade Charles would SOUND LIKE A PRINCE!|`|8lRGGZHOaa	the two names separately are okay, but they sound weird when you put them together because wade is such a modern hipster name and charles is like an old-timey classy name|`|H9o3jdm2aa	No No No No No No GET REAL!!<br>  yuck.|`|I67dh1hMaa	Wade is fine <br>  but not with charles<br>  <br>  maybe with sumthin like <br>  Anderson|`|WapGLYvOaa	no! it sounds very hickish|`|IEZoHcysaa	I like it|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	no
AwvWBROlaa	my midwife told me to eat whatever i want. haha... just use your best common sense. No alcohol no smokes or illegal drugs while breastfeeding. Not that you should be doing these if your not breastfeeding but you get the point. Some babies are picky though, i wouldnt eat anything tooo spicy because it might upset your babys tummy. you might want to skip chocolate unless you dont mind cranky baby all night long. =)|`|LWXRVO5Haa	Yes you can eat that. In moderation of course.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	im not sure, you should ask your doctor but you just made me really hungry for some shrimp = ^ )|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I've had 2 sections, and can tell you that you can pretty much return to eating normal food 9 days after your surgery. Your pain meds may affect your stomach though. Also, spicy food will give your baby gas if you are nursing. It can make for one cranky baby!<br>  <br>  Be careful with seafood though if you are nursing as well because if it is not prepared properly you can make yourself as well as your baby sick. <br>  <br>  Take care!|`|Cgrd1CWoaa	yes you can eat sea food the hot sauce might make your breast milk nasty
6xf1GfbUaa	No. Giving your baby boy a terrible childhood without morals or principles and exposing him to bad behaviors or traumatic experiences, IS what makes him PRONE to being a criminal when older.|`|Lfha91fsaa	well that's just ridiculous|`|2rOQyvaKaa	Oh so that makes me a criminal? That's so lame!|`|oem5yEUDaa	Obviously it's not the name that makes them a criminal. If they are teased and tormented at school it may make them depressed, or angry. Their parents shoud help them to learn to deal with bullies and how to appropriately manage the situation. If this is not done though the depression an anger could get worse and even lead to suicide, or as you said acting out criminally. It is not the name that determines whether they are a criminal or not though.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I don't agree. A name is a name. It doesn't determine a persons personality and make them commit crimes.<br>  <br>  And it also sounds very sexist. Why only boys? why not girls as well?|`|jdf1qVtOaa	only if people tease him about it. Teach him to stand up for himself, and he'll be fine.|`|tVqLmImUaa	I can see the logic behind that. Kind of. If a boy had a name that was so unusual that he felt different and alienated from the crowd, then naturally he'd grow up with poor self-esteem (and want to rebel against conformity).<br>  <br>  I think names matter a lot more when it comes to men.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	A BOY NAMED SUE! HOW DO YOU DO!  NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE!|`|8EuaEGkyaa	Thats interesting!<br>  <br>  I don't know how that would affect them though. I have heard of plenty of men with a name such as John who are criminals too.|`|xxLZ0Brwaa	Only if you call him Adolf,Saddam or Beckham.
6IXXbZ0xaa	Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors.|`|yItRKxJvaa	If you still don't feel well in the morning that is your body telling you you need to rest and let yourself recover. Going to school when your ill is not a good idea as most likely will make you feel worse resulting in even more missed school!<br>  Although you don't realise when you are healthy, going to school and participating in lessons requires more effort than you think, therefore it is probably not a good idea. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Get well soon!|`|pSoebISGaa	If you feel really ill, don't go in. Another day won't hurt and you can catch up.<br>  If you feel abit ill, make the effort to go into school. Then if you still feel bad, just get sent home.<br>  <br>  I'd say try and go into school. You might get over it tomorrow or whilst you sleep.|`|QjePchibaa	See how you feel in the morning.  If you still feel crappy it's okay to miss school, life will continue|`|SJS87QCLaa	Load up on the ibprofen or advil before school. If you get sick go to the nurse and your mom can pick you up early. Don't go if you have a temperature though! and most of all RELAX and get a goodnight's sleep!|`|AA11296427	Keep calm, a day or two of school won't hurt! If you still don't feel well, then don't go to school! <br>  <br>  Get better soon!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|Us5zNCZkaa	Just think about, how fun it is to be with friends and things like that. <br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe go to school if you feel good,<br>  <br>  or just go for 2 hours maybe so you can get your home work <br>  <br>  <br>  and maybe your mom or dad can come get you if you really  need to come home. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped. :D <br>  feel better!

WWcaKZ7Qaa	I really doubt that you are but no one can confirm it through the internet. If you are really concerned just go take a pregnancy test. You can get them for $1 at the dollar store. That should ease your mind a bit.|`|2osuEr0naa	LOL omg, hunny TAKE A DAMN TEST. :] i don't think you're pregnant. Condoms are 99.9 accurate.|`|v9rzGYWoaa	It doesn't sound like pregnancy to me.

h8l1H4N4aa	Every family who lives under one roof every day has their ups and downs.  We all get on each other's nerves at one time or another and it's perfectly normal.  One day, my daughter and I will be laughing and hanging out and the next day, we're following each other around the house yelling and cursing about the stupidest things.  Who else can you argue with and be forgiven by if not family and close friends? <br>  <br>  It would help to know how old you are.  Separation is normal at a certain age.  Growing up comes in stages and you may be at the age when you need to be your own person.  You'll reconnect with family in a 'different' way as time goes on. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, you sound like an intelligent, mature  and caring daughter and I wouldn't mind having you as one of my own.|`|82PkTDwwaa	How do you feel about yourself and how your relationship is with your parents?

Mxr6AIkiaa	For a toddler, or a young child who is sick and temporarily functioning like a toddler, Mommy = "person I know and trust to take care of me" and Daddy = "person I know and trust to take care of me who is not Mommy."|`|TXcC12ETaa	well if your the only one taking care of her she might be looking up to you as her actual mom. maybe you should tell your parents about it an tell them that they need to take care of their child an not leave it to you!|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Maybe she is trying to have fun with you?

T0pkW783aa	It is very rare for a mother to die during her pregnancy, especially in the United States, where there are all kinds of tests done on a regular basis; sonograms, blood tests, etc. where the progress of the pregnancy is monitored and the safety of the mother and child are always watched very carefully.  Blood pressure and weight are issues and are carefully observed.  If you should have an issue with high blood pressure, your doctor will see you more often and make sure that nothing will interfere with your child's safety or yours.  That is why it is of utmost importance to be under the care of a doctor during your entire pregnancy.  If you are worried, you should talk to your doctor about your concerns. He will tell you if you are too skinny and not taking in enough calories to help nourish your unborn child.  Being anorexic could be a problem if that is something you are concerned about.  Please go to your doctor with your concerns and he can help reassure you and offer you advice on your personal condition.  An internet site cannot really offer you the most objective information for your particular pregnancy.<br>  <br>  PS:  I was very skinny when I got pregnant (20-30 lbs. underweight) but had a very easy pregnancy with no complications.  I gained 45 lbs. during the 9 months and had 7 lb. babies with fast and very easy deliveries, much to my surprise!!|`|LDLTjNCraa	Having a weak heart is a major one|`|X6rFPI2laa	There are actually quite a few things, which is why prenatal care is so important!

vKEYa8aeaa	i wouldnt want him their either. i also wouldnt want him in my babys life. if he cant even be just a good boyfriend to you then how is he supposed to be a good dad? im sorry for what you are going through and hope you the best|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	1. You don't know for sure if there will be a problem if he shows up. It kind of sounds like he wouldn't be the one to cause trouble. I'm not defending his actions, I would be thinking the same things if I were you, but there may be more problem if he's not informed. <br>  <br>  2. You are right, the baby doesn't care who's there and it's your choice who is allowed in the room during your labor and the delivery. You may consider informing him that you are in labor, but if he comes to the hospital he will be waiting in the waiting room. No one can make you have visitors and hospitals are usually even more restrictive of visitors and the patient's wishes in the maternity ward for the safety of the baby.<br>  <br>  3. Before this child comes you might think about contacting the father to find out his stance on this situation. Try to stay calm even though there is probably nothing you would like more than to tear his head off and spit down his neck. Write down your concerns and questions for him before you call and just read from the list. You can find out what he stands and what he plans on doing in regards to this child (if anything).|`|02SG8Dchaa	do whats best for you. i think our opinions will range from yeah to go ahead so u know him and u know you but i think that if u do whats best u have no reason to look back on this as regretable. i also know that giving birth was amazing the whole time i was there and everything so u dont want him to spoil it.|`|AV0eejfLaa	Giving birth is hard enough u don't need anyone there to make things harder. But u should let him know after the baby's born|`|01Mu3wUeaa	In my opinion, I think you are.This isn't just your child.This child has half of his DNA inside his/her little body.<br>  <br>  You have to put all personal grudges aside now.Its not about you and its not about him.It is now about this baby and whether you like it or not, you will be attached to this dude for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  I do not think it is right for him not to be there during his child's birth.I understand that he is a cheating piece of crap, but I wouldn't want to take that experience away from anyone.It doesn't matter if it won't impact the child if he was there or not (which you have no clue if it will or won't...it affected my cousin that my uncle wasn't there for her birth oddly) <br>  <br>  How do you know that he will start trouble? have you two sat down and had a mature conversation about how things will play out once the child is born? whether you hate him or not, you guys need to do this.This child is coming and you two need to be on the same page.<br>  <br>  Has he expressed emotion about how he wanted to be in the child's life or not?<br>  <br>  Of course, your well being is the best and a stress free environment is the best choice.Talk to him before the baby is born so you don't have to deal with this crap when the baby gets here.Let him know that he is either with you on this (raising the baby) or not.You don't need a liar/cheater to complicate things do tell him straight up not to play games or its game over for him.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Call and give him two options:<br>  <br>  1. he is not called and doesn't know his child has been born until you leave the hospital <br>  <br>  2. he is in the waiting room and can see the baby once he/she is cleaned up and can only stay for fifteen minutes<br>  <br>  If he is angry and refuses to choose, then it's option 1. If he calls later and decides to agree to option 2, then it's option 2. <br>  <br>  While he cheated on you, he has every right to be there for the moment his child is born. You'd be furious if you had to miss a major moment of your child's life because you made a mistake. I'm not condoning his behavior and I'm definitely not telling you to get back together with him, but right now you ARE using the baby to get back at him by not telling him about his child's birth. <br>  <br>  You're using your anger at the father's behavior to get back at him by refusing to let him see his child. That's immature and selfish, no matter how justified you feel about the situation. I would be angry, too!<br>  You need to put aside your anger and fury for the sake of your child who has every right to meet his/her father when he/she is born. Right now, you are depriving your child, not the man.|`|a3vUpsoUaa	I think since YOUR having the baby all that is YOUR choice<br>  Yes it may hurt him if you don't tell him but if he's been cheating on you and you think he might come and cause trouble at the hospital then maybe not telling him might be the best choice<br>  <br>  but then again that could really make him angry<br>  <br>  I'd say talk to a parent or doctor or someone that knows a little more and might be able to give more advice|`|lgha3kLIaa	i think your a strong girl and keep on being that way, i do think you should let him in the room when the baby comes especially if you want him to be in the babies life, i think that will help him realize how real baby is and will eventually be taking full responsibility. if he causes trouble in the hospital there is hopspital security and you can kick who ever you want out! good luck honey.|`|sOwjPQR8aa	IDK i don t think you are being to harsh on him, but you may want to at least ask him why he cheated on you and tell him how you feel...then leave his nasty ***|`|rS47E0rqaa	I would do the same thing.<br>  One of my friend's sister was pregnant, her man was out cheating on her the whole time, she found out after she had the baby and cheated on him with his best friend (not very lady-like I know) but I'm not saying do that instead but, just let him see the baby he doesn't have to be present at the time of the birth or even at the hospital at all. When you do see him make sure you have a friend or family member there for moral support because things can get very emotional after wards knowing he did something like that to you.

Go and do a test you never know. Good luck and i wish you baby dust...
0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I'm not a parent but I work with enough kids I've seen every faker and real illness in the books... maybe not every but a lot. <br>  Fake: <br>  The biggest sign of a faker is one who was complaining about having to do something just before becoming "sick". For instance, "No, I'm not doing my homework!" Then when you say, "Yes you are, you may start with writing or reading." They comeback with, "I have a headache."<br>  Another big sign of a faker is one who suddenly becomes better when threatened with the loss of a privilege (like going outside to play or going to a friends house).<br>  <br>  Real:<br>  An actually physical symptom; fever, swollen glands, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, sweating (with no physical activity), flushing, holding their head/tummy, tiredness (naps in a kid who doesn't take naps), crying, not wanting to participate in activities they normally enjoy.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	fever and excretions = sick|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	If they don't look pale, and they pretend to cough their not sick. If there is a temp and i see throwing up and fatigue yes their sick.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	I have a rule in my house that has, without fail, stopped the sickness faking.<br>  <br>  Kids that are too sick to go to school, must stay in bed.  They can read a book, but no TV, no video games, etc.  When kids are young, they can't keep up the facade.  Pretty soon, they are jumping on the bed or beinig "bored".  If they're good enough to jump on the bed and run around the house, I take them back to school.  Do that once or twice and the sick-faking pretty much comes to a halt.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I look at quantifiable symptoms, like running a fever, coughing, nausea/vomiting, etc.|`|AA10953561	With my six year old it's really easy. If she's really feeling sick she will go lay down and whine and complain. If she's faking sick she follows me around telling me how bad she feels and doing the fake cough.<br>  <br>  When she's not really sick she will forget that she's trying to get attention and will get energized and start laughing and playing. That's another sign for me.|`|HK30PzNraa	I can tell by how my kids are acting,if they feel like playing video games or talking a lot they are not that sick.Parents who know their children can tell the difference.|`|ysUg2Rgraa	Well, my 9 year old son is really big on faking- so if you have a fever or just a plain cold and i can HEAR your sickness (coughing,congestion,nose blowing,etc.) you're good to go and you can have one or two days off-until you heal. One that has the fake cough;goes on the internet;plays video games..etc.|`|JczgcRrRaa	I can tell with my kids, none of them lie well.  And they know when they stay home because they are sick, they stay in the bed all day.  Mine will act completely different if they are truly sick, they don't play, laugh or joke around.  They whine a lot more than usual, they don't want to eat and get upset a lot quicker than when they feel ok.  Hope this helps.|`|yaUagKwwaa	find out if they have a test the next day or have problems wiht friends... if u pretend to go the the mall .. if its a girl and ask them if they want to come and they seem all happy then they are FAKING it
oKiW2JwNaa	my son does that too sometimes. i try and stay calm so as to not make a big deal about it as long as he is drinking regularly (milk, juice, water...). My son tends to just drink more during these spells and i usually find that his tummy is a bit funny during those days (constipation, diarrhoea) but after about a week he slowly starts eating normally again and his tummy also settles.<br>  <br>  just keep in mind that as long as she is getting fluid she is ok for a few days. if it hasn't gone away after a few days, you need to see a doctor. <br>  <br>  i also find that certain foods seem ok and that if i just provide little snacks more often, he is usually content. things like fruit, a bit of bread, yogurts, cheese crackers... go down ok during these days and dinners (meat, rice, pasta...) don't go down very well. try and see what your daughter prefers. the thing to remember is that once she's feeling better, you need to stop the snacking and get back to normal meals. it takes a day or two but just be a bit firm and she'll soon go back to normal.<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|fHjSonssaa	My son is only 11 months- and he goes through this too, but I think it has to do with teething.<br>  In your case, I've heard from other parents that kids (all the way to 10,11 on beyond) all go through these phases. <br>  <br>  If you can, check her weight and try to make sure she isn't losing weight.  Could she be teething again?  <br>  <br>  Give it a few more days- as long as she's acting like her self besides the diet changes.

a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	As long as he is still growing and gaining weight, then he is getting enough food.  Young babies sleep alot.  My some is 6 months and usually sleeps alot during a growth spurt.<br>  <br>  What you are doing is called feeding on demand.  You feed him when ever he is hungry what ever amount he wants.<br>  <br>  You can try schedule feedings.  Offer him 3oz every 3 hours.  <br>  <br>  I would talk to your Pediatrician and see if they have any tips for you.|`|kIad9ffRaa	That is normal for a three month old to eat and sleep that much. If you are afraid he isn't eating enough, give him bigger portions farther apart. My child went through the same thing. Don't worry about it.
AA11085356	I'm sure he will grow out of it. My son has started hitting everything now too. Just make sure you always tell him no, and move his hand away. I don't think a smack is really necessary.|`|leKeIi4yaa	Since he is 11 months old, he doesn't comprehend that he is hitting.  He's just happy that he can coordinate his hand into a synchronized movement.  I would probably hold his hand for a few seconds if he hits you, look at him and say "No hit" or "ouch", then kiss his hand. Don't smack him back, he's so little, he won't understand why you're doing it.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	Your doing the wrong thing.  Babies like to have their faces touched.  Likewise they like to touch yours.  You teaching him to not do something that conforts him.  He wants to pet your face like in the love movies or petting a dog.<br>  <br>  Instead of saying no, take his hand and rub it to your face softly.  It will take a few days but he will learn control that he does not have.  He is not trying to hit you he is trying to rub your face gently all animals that raise there young do it.  All primates rub the face to calm the baby, dogs and cats lick because no hand put you get my meaning.<br>  <br>  It can set the child back developmentally to stop it but you also need to use this time to teach good touch bad touch so he learns force and preasure<br>  <br>  Before I get thumbs down I tell my kid know and disipline, he is not allowed to do things he should not like I smack his hand for trying to touch a light socket or something he shouldn't but I never punish for him trying to show affection.  I teach him a better way.|`|WlliZdy1aa	It's normal.<br>  Just keep being persistant with what he is doing.<br>  If he does not grow out of it by the time he is a toddler, start giving him warnings and time outs.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  *Just keep being persistant with what YOU are doing.|`|y9HO1dWsaa	Just hold his hands down so he can't do it and firmly tell him "NO" or "stop".|`|Uwc26gzaaa	yes it is normal just keep telling him no|`|j2Ca8sgjaa	Don't listen to your aunt. There are a couple things you can do. First of all do NOT smack his hands when he hits you like your aunt said, that is just telling him that if mommy hits me than it must be Ok. <br>  <br>  What you CAN do is when he hits you next you should make a sad face so he knows it hurt you and say "ouch! that hurts mommy"<br>  <br>  It may also be a good idea when he does it to take his hand tell him "no, that hurts mommy" and then show him a gentle touch. Take his hand and place it on you nicely and say "gentle touch" then you do it to him and repeat "gentle touch" <br>  <br>  you have to be able to model good behavior please PLEASE don't listen to your aunt!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|22355f171db4a29b75bab72bf2f8ad7eaa	I hope you like UFC.. cause thats where hes goin!
oem5yEUDaa	You can NOT have a period while pregnant, I don't care what anyone says. Even if people say they had their period during their pregnancy they are wrong it was not their period. You can have bleeding and yes the bleeding can follow the normal cycle of your period, but it is not. Shedding the lining of your uterus while pregnant would result in the death of your baby. If you had bleeding and it was not like a regular period you may very well be pregnant. You need to take a test.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey..<br>  <br>  i think your experiencing breakthrough bleeding.<br>  its when the woman bleeds during when period is meant to be due. while pregnant. it is common and this is why many women dont know they are pregnant.<br>  <br>  it could be effects from starting on the pill also . as it hormones into the body. But definitely test as you said. its best to know & take pre natal vitamins if not taking them already. & eat on pregnant -- Diet .. Okay foods only darling. Remember act pregnant. if possibly pregnant.<br>  <br>  Those are symptoms of hormone changes that can mean conception has occured.<br>  <br>  God Bless x All the best for you darling and your fiance|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	That many days...no.  Implantation bleeding is usually quite light, and occurs during implantation (which is about  5-12 days post conception roughly.)|`|NrkX5Souaa	you can be pregnant witha light period|`|A0tWlG94aa	Just take a test...if it was implantation bleeding, it shouldnt have lasted for that many days<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|GeimyUi6aa	did you not do sex ed!?!!?!|`|MitunV2Faa	Well I don't believe you can have your "period" while pregnant. But you can bleed. I have a cousin who bled for the first four months of her pregnancy. She is sort of heavy set already and she was bleeding so she didn't notice a weight gain and of course just assumed she was having her period. She didn't notice any other symptoms either. Then she went to the doctor to get on birth control and they gave her a customary urine test and it came out positive. She told the doctor that she'd been having her period regularly though and asked for an ultrasound. And she was 15 weeks pregnant. So all though yes you can bleed during pregnancy take a test before getting to excited. I wish you the best of luck and hope you guys are soon blessed with a beautiful baby of your own!

8c1543nUaa	You can't stop the crush or tell anyone you never had a crush at age 10. You CAN, however put an age limit on dating. My parents' rule was, no dating until after you can drive. It kinda worked. I had a boyfriend at 15 but we didn't "date" until we were 17. Neither of us could drive until then so we couldn't have "dated" anyway. But the rule kept us out of trouble and eventually we got married. (Probably the LAST thing you want to hear right now...) Just tell him to take it slow. Life goes too fast to waste it all on crushes and dating.|`|wY1VgXppaa	It's fine you might need to tell him you don't think he should go out until a certian age. (ie.15 16) but other than that I wouldn't worry about it. One of my friends kids had a crush younger than that . She was nine and this boy actually asked her out. They are just kids but you can certianly ask the teachers to keep an eye out as well as watching the situtation yourself|`|R8nxkVJSaa	Don't worry about it.<br>  Start worrying when he's older, but for now let him have fun and be a kid. <br>  10 year olds won't do anything bad!|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Let him be, it's cute.<br>  <br>  I had a crush on a girl when I was 10.|`|pPlVUIA8aa	Aww how cute, and normal.<br>  <br>  Big woop!

It's better for him to have some experience starting from age 10 then for him to have his first crush at 20 and have no clue what do do about it. I had my first crush on a boy when I was 9. It really wasn't anything much. He was just smart, funny, and kind of cute, and I liked that about him enough to consider him as more than a friend. That was pretty much it. That's probably what your son feels right now, so just leave it be.|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	Nothing, it's cute! I remember my first crush, I was only 5. It was in the first grade and I had the BIGGEST crush on this boy.

iVcaB9h7aa	Every state is different.  For some it's 18, some 19, some 21, and a few are at 25.<br>  <br>  Look at the link below to find the laws for your state.  If it says "adult", you'll need to do a little research to learn what a legal adult is in your state.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Every area has its own minimum ages, from 18 to 21.  Just keep in mind though that those numbers are a minimum only.  For practical purposes the age limit is much higher.  By that I mean that while you may be 21 you will still need to show that you are financially able to be approved, that you have a suitable home that meets the standard and you must be both mature as a person and mature in your relationship (if any).  If you are single you must also be able to show that you are able to both care for a child AND maintain a job.  For those reasons, the practical age limit is generally higher then what the stated minimums are.|`|850zmycZaa	Like everyone else has said, it depends on your state. The ages vary from 18-25 (like the first person said any state requiring you to be over 22 to foster or adopt). Find out the age!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
Ep0CpwDbaa	You could try some more traditional ways of money-making - baby-sitting, mowing lawns, dog-walking - you get the idea. I won't go into much detail about these since they're pretty self-explanatory.<br>  <br>  Or try something different - computer programming is a good moneymaker if you're patient enough to try it. It's really not as hard as it sounds. Game design is another good option, if you can find a way to get some software like Torque. If any of you are fast typists, type up papers for a law firm or any other big company.

124377045ceac9826f76a176d439bd8faa	I disagree with those who say spanking should only be a last resort. Now, I do not advocate spanking kids all the time---actually talking is just fine a great deal of the time---but when punishment is called for--it really is, in my experience, much more effective..<br>  <br>  My kids are probably punished less than most kids, but spanked more.<br>  <br>  For it to be effective, like all punishments, you have to be consistent--and that is the hardest thing--but the most important.<br>  <br>  I have noticed that some parents who say spanking does not work, are not only inconsistent, but do not really spank in the correct way. The immediate point of a spanking is to, within reason, give a good momentary ouch-- a dull thud over layers of clothing does nothing--but give the child something to get dramatic about--so the spankings in my home are almost always bare bottom--there is a good reason it is the traditional way to spank.|`|88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	Kids can be quit a challenge. I haven't seen spanking be effective. Standing firm that you are in charge and will settle for no less than respect seems to be very successful.<br>  <br>  You have to spend time with your child to change a pattern of behavior. Someone else already wrote a great reply. You have to find out why he is being destructive. With boys it works better to talk while playing basketball or some other activity.  Also,when a child sees that you are going to be consistent in calm cool way and give him natural consequences for destructive behavior, the behavior usually diminishes. Kids do it for attention or to see if you will take the time to be consistent in setting boundaries. They don't realize that.<br>  Give him goals to work towards with good behavior. Maybe he can bring a friend to your next hiking trip, trip to the beach or hiking trip.<br>  It sounds like he has a lot of energy that needs to be guided into positive activities.<br>  <br>  Find out who he is hanging out with at school and make sure his afterschool childcare is quality.<br>  <br>  Talk to your school counselor or your child's teacher to see if they have any insights to help you.<br>  <br>  Kids take a lot of time and effort but every quality minute you spend with them pays off.<br>  <br>  Of course it took me a long time to learn all this with many mistakes along the way.<br>  <br>  Wishing you well.<br>  <br>  ~Teacher of high-needs children|`|AA10556677	Spanking is not abuse. <br>  <br>  You spank a child when he/she refuses to obey you multiple, or refuses to take his other punishment. <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  "Johnny, that was your third warning. Go to your room."<br>  "NOOO!"<br>  "Johnny, go to your room."<br>  "NOOO!"<br>  <br>  Now you can spank Johnny. And then send him to his room.<br>  <br>  Some parents say that they don't like it that their kid seems afraid of them sometimes. You shouldn't worry too much about this. A parent is a parent first, friend second, and a big part of being a parent is discipline. When kids are little, they SHOULD be a little bit afraid of their parents.|`|Rn9SO1Wjaa	Spanking should be the last resort and I wouldn't suggest it, try time out and if that doesn't work then take away his toys, if that doesn't work then take away TV and if that doesn't work threaten that you will call the police cause he is behaving bad and they need to discipline him that worked like a charm with mine, I told her that she was going to get a new mommy and daddy if she didn't behave appropriately. I explained to her the importance of conduct/behavior when she wanted something she would get it if and only if she behaved right if not then that was out of the question good behavior is rewarded bad behavior isn't!|`|yCUOXInFaa	You might have to find out why the child is being destructive! acting out in a destructive fashion is usually a result of frustration or trying to get attention, maybe you need to listen to the childs needs!  remove their favourite toys and dont give them back until they behave themselves.|`|8PA7ndf8aa	Both my husband and I grew up with spankings. My dad had to go out to the yard and get a stick. I got spanked with a belt. We started out spanking our children (hands only) and realized they weren't learning anything except to be afraid to come to us just like we were with our parents. We started timeouts. This works really well if you are consistent. Kids are smart and will push you to the limit. I then saw Super Nanny on tv.  I love how she show parents to set time aside for their kids, and how to get down to their level to talk to them. I started using her techniques long before I saw her on the show. I felt really good once I saw I was taking a step in the right direction in disciplining my children. I am not perfect at it, but at least I am breaking the spanking chain.  <br>  <br>  I have come to realize we are all just doing our best with what we have and have to find out works for our kids.

t0mb150gaa	I think you should just tell her the truth and explain that her cat was old/sick and went to heaven. There are books that explain the life cycle for children her age so that she can better understand what happened. Lying to her isn't going to give her any comfort or closure...and she is going to be upset either way so sticking with the truth is the best way so she can better understand things. You also need to explain to her that it was her cats time because you don;t want her to worry about everyone close to her dying if they get sick.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	You have three options:<br>  1.  Tell her the truth then be there to comfort her<br>  2.  Lie and say her cat ran away<br>  3.  Go and get another cat before she gets home<br>  <br>  It's up to you on which on you choose.|`|2pxiK9waaa	You just need to explain that Kimo was (old or sick) and died. You should go to Barnes and Noble or the library and get a book on pets dying and read it to her so she understands. To cover it up or lie is just not right. She needs to learn the cycle of life. It's a hard concept to learn and it can't come soon enough.|`|EojLkaQHaa	You can tell her that the cat decided to go to a happier place and that she didn't want to leave, but she had to. At 4 years old most children will believe the story and very hopefully not be too affected.<br>  <br>  Sorry for you and your daughters loss. :(|`|q0JTN9QAaa	Just tell her the cat is dead.  Children need to understand things like this and it will make it easier when a person dies if she understands death now.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	when my cat got run over, my mom told me she ran off somewhere. you could do that.|`|1NK1hK1Taa	I'm sure she is aware of the concept of heaven? Tell her that she has gone to heaven. To a better place where she will have lots of friends to play with all the time. She will be able to have lovely food and it will not rain when she is outside. No dogs barking at her, because in heaven dogs and cats play with each other. <br>  Just break it to her gently. You don't need to tell her that she was wrapped around the back wheels of the lorry that ran her over, if that is how she died, that bit you can lie about. But from experience if you lie about death it will only come back and bite you later. <br>  Just lay it on thick that where she is now is so much better than where we all are now.|`|jR8kyp0Taa	When I gave my cat away, my niece noticed a couple days later that the cat was gone.

I returned to work within 8 weeks as I needed the money.  I struggled alone spending more than I earn and decided I needed a far better paid job, and to gain qualifications was my best bet.  I've spent a lot more money in gaining qualifications and I reckon I'm half way to achieving my goal.  6 months ago my daughter's father returned jobless but different, we got on great and my daughter was delighted to have her dad.  A few weeks ago I found out I was pregnant, due on 2nd October.  He was over the moon and persuaded me we'd have a wonderfully happy family etc etc. He walked out again today.  I can't believe I fell for it, and I was looking forward to a happy family.  I will now have an abortion as I couldn't cope with or afford another child.  I'm in no position to offer advice but hope you feel better knowing there are other women in a similar position as you are.  Good luck.x

Don't burn your bridges.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	the tablet works up to 19 weeks, there is a suction method, depending on how many weeks pregnant the women is, depends on weather she is put to sleep or stays awake.<br>  a tube is inserted into the womb and the bay is sucked out, if the baby is small (before 10 weeks of pregnancy) it will fit through the tube, if the pregnancy is more than this, arms and legs are pulled off to fit the baby through the tube<br>  <br>  i really dont agree with abortion, carrying a child for 40 weeks, giving birth to it, then giving it to a loving family who have always wanted a baby but could never have their own, will not destroy your life|`|2osuEr0naa	An abortion can usually be done up to 8 weeks of your pregnancy, but every clinic is different. <br>  <br>  When I first found out that I was pregnant, i found out at planned parent hood. They told me about abortion. There are two types. There is the pill which you take at home. Then there is what they call a "vacuum" and your under the care of doctors. They told me it's very painful mentally and physically. I couldn't go through with it. So i decided to keep my baby. Really think about this. If you don't think you can handle a baby, then think about adoption.|`|qlECsz0Iaa	There is several different method.  It depends on how far along you are, yes there is an abortion pill: RU486, theres probably a couple other abortion pills but i dont know for sure. <a href="http://www.ru486facts.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ru486facts.org/</a><br>  <br>  I think the most popular method is suction aspiration.<br>  <a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/abortiontypes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifesitenews.com/abortiontype...</a>  list of abortion procedures.<br>  <br>  No its not free in the US, as far as I know.  I think the pill is relatively cheap, but i've never taken it or know anyone that has so i can't be for sure on that one.<br>  <br>  In general the further along the abortion is done the more expensive it is (i've heard they start out at $300 and go up from there).<br>  <br>  I am pro-life and do not support or encourage abortion, but i do think its important for anyone considering it to be well informed of exactly what they are doing.|`|yCUOXInFaa	Yes a pill is used within the first few weeks of pregnancy, medication into the vagina and surgical removal is usually done further into the pregnancy with possible serious complications.<br>  In some states abortion is still illegal, so you may have to check that out, otherwise clinics are free.<br>  The effects of an abortion would be different for every woman, the psychological ramifications would certainly outweigh the physical ones....|`|k32ktOLmaa	i think if you realize you're pregnant in the first few months then you can do the pill method... but if you are a bulging melon then i think there's a more complicated method  (and where i live the youth clinics provide the pills for free, not sure about your area)|`|CLWLHLh3aa	Depending how far gone you are depends on what method of abortion you have. Within the first month or so you can have the pill after that you have an anaesthetic and they surgically remove the foetus which gets slightly more complicated towards the last month in which you can have an abortion.<br>  As far as I know everywhere does it free under the NHS.<br>  It doesn't effect your ability to have children in the future. But can slightly increase risks of miscarriage. <br>  The main way it effects you is mentally, as many women can feel bad and regret their decision.|`|xPTUzTBcaa	Depends how far gone, there's a pill but that can only be taken for the 1st few weeks, it makes the woman miscarry.<br>  <br>  Abortions are basically done by scraping the foetus out. Most women are put under general anaesthetic for it, but can be done while they're awake. Then they'll get a fairly heavy period. Usually there's no lasting effects, although sometimes, very rarely it can cause fertility problems later on. Generally I'd say leaves more psychological damage than physical.<br>  <br>  It's free from the NHS, you'll need to see your GP, who will arrange it. I think two doctors have to sign the forms before you can have it done. Or you can get it done privately I don't know how much that costs, I reckon it to be at least ￡400, but I don't know.<br>  <br>  Later on in pregnancy, the woman has to give birth to the (dead) baby. That's quite distressing.|`|MitunV2Faa	There isn't a pill as far as I know. There's a pill called "Plan B" which you take if the unprotected sex happened 1-5 days ago. <br>  But there are not abortion clinics in all states. But if you plan to get an abortion you need to find out where the closest clinic is to you. You go there for me it cost $600 and this was two years ago I doubt it is cheaper anywhere else. They talk to you about the choice you are making and tell you that you will experience heavy bleeding and cramping afterward. And they prescribe you medication for this. As for the actual procedure they give you an ultrasound and put you to sleep and "remove" the child. When you come to back to consciousness about 20 minutes later you are out of it for the rest of the day and you come in and out of consciousness for about a half hour.  As of does it affect you...if your asking physically...no besides what I've already said. But emotionally YES immensely. I greatly regret having got an abortion. But being only 16 and alone and scared and basically homeless living with friends and with no clue what to do until the father of the child offered to pay for an abortion. I felt it was my only choice. But now if I could go back I would never have done this. Still today I cry over what I've done. So many people try for years to get pregnant with no success and I was lucky enough to be blessed and I was naive and made a very poor decision. I wouldn't advise anyone to make this choice. But if you feel its the right decision for you than that's your choice. Good Luck.|`|A5D62Ycbaa	There are different methods depending on how many weeks pregnant you are.  <br>  If you go through your doctor and the NHS it would be free.<br>  Theres a link below (charagble private clinic) this gives you some info on methods and effects or look on NHS direct.<br>  <a href="http://www.mariestopes.org.uk/Home.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.mariestopes.org.uk/Home.aspx</a>
hIzQyflqaa	i would say its possible minus a bit of belly skin but i never managed it in 3 years and now im pregnant again!|`|xprwl2Cpaa	I reckon it's certainly possible.  My friend has had 2 children and she looks in great shape!  Healthy eating and regular exercise :)
eP729T0Qaa	I have been on Clomid and I had several eggs as well. My dr told me I had a chance of twins, but nothing else. I would say go for it!!! Wouldn't it be great to get two for the price of one? I really wanted twins since I have PCOS as well. It's hard when you have to take drugs to help you get pregnant and when you've waited so long! I would definitely do it and see what happens. By the way, after two cycles of Clomid I am now pregnant with just one!|`|og9mxwK4aa	I've never personally used clomid but when it was a new drug my mother used it. While she was taking it her doctor kept warning her about multiples. But you have to think... if you're trying to have a baby... wouldn't two or three be just as wonderful as one??<br>  <br>  She concieved and after getting pregnant she stopped the clomid. She had a beautiful baby girl. About 5 months after having her she noticed that she wasn't having a period and she assumed that she was in menopause.. <br>  NOPE!!<br>  she was pregnant again even without using the drugs.<br>  <br>  So my advice is you and your hubby should trust that everything happens for a reason and also... you should get at it!! teehee!!<br>  <br>  good luck!
dN5BJeVpaa	It depends how old they were.<br>  If they were under 8, I would make it VERY clear that matches aren't to be played with. <br>  If the older child was "immune" to spankings - and saw them as a momentary punishment because I guess I didn't hit hard enough, they would also have another consequence or maybe a different one entirely. <br>  I don't like the idea of having to strike actual fear into the child, which I think is what most people have to do to get their 11 year old to react to a spanking - but that's just me. <br>  <br>  Soooo. I would deliver the right kind of punishment to each child. If one was older - her phone and ipod go in my closet and she get grounded. If she was younger, than spankings are just right. But for different aged younger children, I think I would just get the point across to each child. Spank, then talk and make sure they understand. <br>  I don't think there's a formula exactly.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	To begin with, I don't believe spanking is the right way to go.  You can't belt obedience into children.  Perhaps the mom should show the girls exactly what can happen with fire.  Maybe set fire to one of their favourite toys (outside of course) so will know its destructive power.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	It would totally depend on the ages of the kids.  With young ones a lecture and spanking gets it across.  With older children, taking away things, grounding and punishments work best.|`|gDzPtbwraa	uhhh NO thats child abuse<br>  <br>  YOUR SUCH A TERRIBLE MOM EVEN TO THINK THAT|`|WtM9JnqYaa	I am not a mother myself, but if the three children were caught doing the same wrong thing then in my opinion they all deserve the same punishment no matter the age difference. As the saying goes, "What's good for the goose is good for the gander,"  meaning, if it is good for one person, its good for everyone. And you won't be spanking them that hard so whats the difference? Just give them all the same amount.<br>  Now that's just my opinion of course. :)|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Spanking is not a good idea.  Your kids don't learn empathy through spanking.  They just learn "that made mom mad and now I fear her anger" - but they don't really understand why she was mad, or how to resolve problems.  Our kid has never been spanked, and he's very obedient (never dared play with matches, and doesn't talk back).  We do time outs based on age - 4 years old = 4min time out.|`|ybi9rcu4aa	Dunno if I would spank them, but definitely just give them the same punishment if you are doing it physically and don't do too many. The purpose of spanking shouldn't be to actually make her hurt, just show that the kid did a bad thing. Too much does no good and you're just hurting the kid.|`|35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	Depends how old the kids are. I think the older one should know better, usually, and probably was the one who started it anyway, so I would punish her more (dunno if I would spank them, especially on the skin) but I would punish the older one more.|`|ODblt2gTaa	if i were the mom...i would not have time to think of who got spanked how many times more or less thatn the other...i would be so pissed off that i would be in a spanking frenzy.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	i give my 2 boys the same punishment. but i dont think there is anything wrong with the other way either. depends on how naughty they are being!|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I wouldn't spank either of them. They're 10 and 12! I don't spank to begin with but those two are old enough to get a different punishment (lecture, grounding, etc). <br>  <br>  In my opinion, spankings are ridiculous. They did something bad so you smack them? Why not talk to them about what they did and make it a learning experience? They need to know precisely what they did was wrong and how they can prevent it from happening in the future.<br>  <br>  I was spanked a few times as a child (mainly by my dad) and it taught me nothing! I still got into trouble occasionally and when I did something wrong I was scared of telling my parent's. I would get smack, yelled at for being stupid, and that was it. That wasn't appropriate punishment. It just made me hide little things from them (like if I broke something on accident) because I didn't want to get spanked. <br>  <br>  After my parent's divorced my mom never spanked us again and I could actually talk to her and we all got along much better. <br>  <br>  But those two were close enough in age and maturity to get the same punishment.

I'd go crazy if I still wasn't able run to the store by myself.<br>  <br>  On weekends I fully expect him to give me 1 day to sleep in. <br>  <br>  These are his children too. His day does not end at 5:00 when our job as a SAHM runs from 5:00am-5:00am daily... I understand there are those days that were just so hard and he wants to shut down at veg out in front of a TV, but he can still change a diaper. Being a parent regardless of who brings home the bacon is still a 24 hour a day job for BOTH parents.|`|wENdWT5kaa	Hell no your not being unfair, are you kidding me??? Your situation sounds exactly like mine. <br>  <br>  You both have jobs, sadly tho, you just don't get paid for it. And a person can not stay at his/her job 24/7. When his job at work is done at 5, thats when he "gets away from it". You need to get away too once in awhile. <br>  <br>  We all need breaks,  after all, we are only human. <br>  <br>  He shouldn't expect you to do it all. And no it is not unfair that you expect him to help out with the kids. Because worked all day doesn't mean he can't change a diaper or two or sit on his @ss and feed the baby. (if bottlefed of course, a little hard if the baby is breast fed. :)  )<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad for feeling that he should help out more, cause he absolutly should help you out. So what, he brings in the money, you are the one that keeps the houshold going, you are the one who is taking care of his kids, you are the one that is keeping a clean house for him, you are the one that cooks for him and you are the one that does his laundry for him. The very least he can do for you is to let you walk out and take a break for how ever long you need it and help you out with the kids. <br>  <br>  Don't forget your job is 24/7 his job ends at 5. <br>  <br>  You did not make those kids by yourself you know. :) <br>  <br>  That guy of yours needs a little talking to i think. Good luck. :)|`|14JQ11AUaa	Did I miss the part where you said he is not their father...? I didn't think so! He is their Daddy and it will NEVER change...NEVER! His day at work ends at 5pm, yes. But if he does not come home and spend time with his kids..give them baths or feed them, change them...then what does he do for them other than provide? You are NOT being unfair, I am the same way. Sometimes I feel the need to jump on the city bus just to ride it downtown and back home lol. We need a break just as well as they do.|`|AV0eejfLaa	I don't think what u r asking is unreasonable and have been in ur situation. Instead of leaving when he gets home give it a hour or so for him to relax after he gets home maybe after dinner then take ur break that way he got a time to relax . And he and the children r fed and everyone is happy. Try it it worked for me|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You deserve time away from the home to get some errands done without company and just center yourself, however, right after your husband gets home may not be the best time to ask him to take over. You both work full time (more than full time) jobs that require a lot from you each, when he gets home maybe plan on eating dinner together and catching up on each other's day for an hour or so. After that, let him know you need to get out of the house for a little while and will be back soon. I wouldn't make it an everyday thing, but once a week I wouldn't imagine he would have too much against it. Maybe one weekend a month hire a babysitter for an evening and get out together so both of you can have some relaxation time.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	no your not being unfair but what would make it easier if you could catch some time to yourself during the day do you not have a relative that can help out ?<br>  <br>  im sure he would need  a hr or so to his self also after work  to relax so might just be a bit much as soon as he gets home and might be overly touchy!!! if hes had a bad day<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW:  i felt like this when my ones where younger they are 8 and 3 now but i got  a little part time job for 15 hrs a week even that was make little break away and got me out the house <br>  why dont you alternate the days so he helps out after work ont mon wed and fri and on tue and thur you get a few hours to yourself/|`|PJBjllsVaa	no that's not unfair. being a stay at home mom is a 24 hour 7 day a week job that you rarely get a break from, you don't get paid, you don't get a 'thank you' or a 'good job'.... so if you need to take a break TAKE IT.... when your husband is out working i am willing to bet he gets a lunch break, he gets at least one or two days off doesn't he? what to do you get? an hour out of the house to do more chores (groceriecs etc) no it's not selfish|`|02SG8Dchaa	Ha i love this question because my hubby tried that crap with me. ok so when he gets home i dont throw the baby at him but i let him sit and get settled and eat but after that if i need something done ill ask him to change stuart or feed him dinner. i always tell him that my damn day doesnt end at 5 and i have been up as long as you and i have had my fair share of hard work going on so what makes u think life just stops at 5. i also MAKE time for myself. It will make u feel guilty at first but i got over it in a hurry cuz he even says an at home mommy is hard work and they would not be able to clean and cook and make calls all the while keeping the 17 month old off the fridge and out of the electrical outlets!!!! stand up for urself its not going to get any better on its own. he is not going to miraculously want to do daddy chores <br>  AND this is what having kids is!!!! good luck supermom. <3|`|AA11756768	Your not being unfair, just remind him his workday ends when he leaves, yours doesn't and you would like a break once in awhile. He may be a bit more willing to help out if you wait a little while after getting home to ask him to watch the kids...maybe eat dinner first (if he's anything like my husband he's a LOT happier full :D ) then say you need to go out. It may also help to have him stay home for one day taking care of the kids and doing anything else you normally do so he can see what your day is like and understand why you need to get out and take a break once in awhile. I had my husband spend one night getting up with our newborn and the following morning he told me he had a new respect for me.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	What you are going through is completey normal and very common. I am a sahm of 3 ages 3 months to 5 years. I always say to my husband he needs to help out more because he only works for 8 hours and I work for 24 (baby is not sleeping through the night yet). But he comes home complaining he just want to lay on the couch and relax. I tell him "you had a chance to relax on your drive home". Because being alone in a quiet car is relaxing for me, when I have been around kids all day. My opinion is that men don't give us enough credit for all that we do.  No you are not being unfair at all.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Wow, you're in the same position as me. My hubby also works some extra construction jobs, although we only have 2 children, a 4 month old and a 3 year old.<br>  I feel the same way you do - and my arguement is that as a stay at home mum, we work 24/7. We are always on call - if one of the children get up in the night, we're the ones to attend. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a little time to yourself, and I think it's only fair that he helps out too. Anyway, he should enjoy spending time with his kids, even if it is bathtime, getting ready for bed etc. I'm having the same fight. I find that rather than getting in a huff cos he doesn't offer his help, it's better to say, 'I'm struggling, I really need your help,' then he's much more responsive. He'd let me go in a strop for days before he'd offer a helping hand... Of course, if you ask more than once, you're a 'nag'.<br>  Ah, we can never win.|`|rS47E0rqaa	Pfft heck no you're not being "unfair", he chose his job and so did you both those kids are both of yours so it's a team effort just because he works...and pays the bills and such doesn't mean he gets out of the "house work" part of the day, his house, his kids too.<br>  I think you're doing whats right for you not to lose your mind in a house with three kids like that.<br>  If your going out to the grocery store or something usual like that then who is he to say no, you need food right?<br>  I mean if you were going to like a club to party it up downtown and not come home til 4 a.m I understand why he would say no, but you're not so just ask him nicely and he should understand, but he is a man :)
Fy9S6hjIaa	In my opinion, things like this that are actually dangerous deserve serious consequences.  I don't know if you believe in spanking or not, but when my son does anything that is dangerous, we spank him just to really get the point across.  If you don't spank, you might try time outs every time.  Make sure she knows what she's getting in trouble for.  Of course, it depends on the child, but if punishments truly aren't working, she may just be doing to get you flustered.  If nothing seems to be working you might try just calmly telling her no and then redirect her attention to something else.|`|W0oBXlLRaa	I have a 2 1/2 year old and I recently started spanking. I don't do it very often and I always give her a warning and time out first and if that doesn't work she gets a pop on the butt. I count to three and she knows if she doesn't stop what she's doing by the count of three she gets time out. If that doesn't work she gets a pop.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Put a wall cage around them.<br>  Stops little hands from getting near them|`|FDgarm4Zaa	put up like child gates all around it, so she cant' get to it.|`|Q8beYUBEaa	u should by one of those heater covers|`|WAzoKgQ2aa	put little toddler gates around them,, and if she keep doing it, put her in time out,or spank her,.
850zmycZaa	It seems like you talk with your ex-wife a lot about this and you two are willing to talk to each other. Ask her if she'd be comfortable to go out to lunch with you and your son, and just the three of you discuss this. Ask your son what is up. Ask him why he doesn't like coming over. Is it your girlfriend? Is it he doesn't like your house? <br>  <br>  Maybe it's just a phase or maybe you really need to talk about it. If he still doesn't open up at the lunch talk, then I would go ahead and talk with the counselor. Is your son in school? If so, their might be a social worker who you can talk about this with. If not, just find a family counselor and see what happens.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you are the good father and pay child support and all of that. I have some divorced friends and they'd be lucky to have an ex like you! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	The counselor idea is a damn good one. It may not be the most practical or cheapest, but it's a good one. Sometimes small children are more willing to open up to a complete stranger than to their own parents (I was one of them ha ha.) <br>  If you don't feel like going to the counselor, talk to him. Ask him Why he doesn't want to see you, or have his mother talk to him about it, or even his step-dad. <br>  But since you aren't hurting him, he might just be going through a phase, and the counselor could help with that as well..|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Yes, maybe you and your son could try some therapy or talk to a child psychologist etc.<br>  <br>  Maybe your pediatrician can make recommendations if you let him or her know what has been going on.<br>  <br>  take care.|`|mp3TXe5daa	Did you ask you son why? if so what did he say. <br>  How long have you been living with your girlfriend?<br>  Even at 5 I would take him seriously, he is saying something.

mqNxYMuUaa	You’re right – being excessively thirsty is one of the first signs of diabetes. Other signs include your child passing a lot of urine and always seeming hungry, despite not putting on any weight.<br>  <br>  The standard guidelines on fluid intake are that children aged between four and six should have roughly 1.5 litres a day, spread over the day. Older children should have between two and two and a half litres. So at seven, you might expect your son to be drinking something over 1.5 litres. <br>  <br>  Thirsty feeling<br>  There is no specific figure on exactly how much a child needs to be drinking in order for diabetes to be suspected. It’s more a feeling that, no matter how much your child drinks, they still feel thirsty. So if your nephew is having a drink and immediately afterwards says he still feels thirsty, or if he often complains of thirst even though he’s drinking the right amount, this might arouse your suspicions.<br>  <br>  Diabetes on the rise<br>  It’s a good idea to be aware of the signs and symptoms of diabetes, especially as it runs in your family. The condition is becoming more common in children. Currently it’s estimated that one in 700 children are diabetic and a study, carried out in the Oxford area, suggested that the number is rising by four per cent every year.<br>  <br>  Genetics does play a part but the inherited genetic code is complex and the genes responsible have not yet been identified. It is thought that at least six genes are involved. However genetic factors are less strong for Type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes than Type 2 (non insulin dependent). <br>  <br>  Type 1 affects children and young people, and this may be the form of diabetes affecting the young person in your family. This type of diabetes means you depend on insulin injections and also diet to control the body’s blood glucose level. It appears before the age of 40 and is different from Type 2 diabetes, which is generally controlled by diet alone.<br>  <br>  It’s not clear why the number of children with Type 1 diabetes is rising. But there is growing evidence that the rise in childhood obesity might account for the increase in the number of children with Type 2 diabetes. <br>  <br>  Common ages of onset are around six and seven (around your son’s age) and again at 12 or 13, a time when the body is full of growth hormone which is antagonistic to insulin. <br>  <br>  Simple diagnostic test<br>  If diabetes is diagnosed and treated early and effectively, it’s possible to minimise the risk of complications in later life. If you have any reason to suspect your nephew may be diabetic, visit your GP who will be able to carry out a simple urine test. This could detect the presence of glucose in the urine, which would suggest diabetes.|`|Lfha91fsaa	the child really needs to go to the doctor.  nothing can be diagnosed on y/a

AA11763588	Most women ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day they start their period and sperm can hang out waiting on an egg for 72 hours.<br>  <br>  Anytime you have unprotected sex you are at risk to get pregnant.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	The chances are slim to none..<br>  <br>  But there is always a chance depending the length that the period goes for. As sperm can stay present and wait for egg to arrive..<br>  During a period - Since no pregnancy occured. The lining of the uterus sheds and there was no sperm to fertilise the egg and its not needed. So the body expells it. The egg will have already passed about a 1 week before. 24 hours after ovulation... the egg disitegrates. so it wont be there during period...<br>  <br>  So i would say- if next period is odd. Do test. But the chances are low. to those dates.<br>  <br>  godbless|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Generally you can not get sex on the first day of a period because while you are bleeding, your uterus is shedding its lining and egg has already deteriorated. But stranger things have happened so anything is possible, but in the future if you don't want a baby, always use protection.|`|bo4MguzVaa	Yes is can happen, there are many articles online you can read, here is part of one:<br>  <br>  "There is a definite chance that any woman can get pregnant during her periods. Though the chances of pregnancy during periods are usually low during periods, they exist for all women. During periods, the chances of pregnancy are comparatively lower at the onset of a woman’s period and increase just after her periods. The truth is that there is no predictable time during the month when the risk of pregnancy can be said to be absent."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/pregnantduringperiod.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/pregna...</a>|`|J6JFiNL8aa	first...eww<br>  <br>  <br>  second...IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET PREGNANT ON YOUR PERIOD!!!!!<br>  It is not as common BUT VERY POSSIBLE........you'll have to wait and see|`|QI0js7MRaa	u aren't fertile while you are on your period! so no
ehvzQRkkaa	You will need <br>  a crib, unless you co-sleep, if you do use a crib, you do not need bumper pads and tons of blankets, those are extra/non-essentials<br>  a car seat, you cannot leave the hospital without one<br>  a stroller or carrier are not needed but will make things much easier <br>  a monitor--unless you have your baby in your room<br>  and baby care products--shampoo, soap, creams and lotions <br>  <br>  You might want<br>  a swing or bouncy seat<br>  <br>  Monthly you will need <br>  wipes and diapers! both are usually always on sale somewhere and you can get coupons monthly also! <br>  solid food after 6 months-which you can make yourself and save a ton! <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding will REALLY help! So make sure she gets lots of help with a proper latch to ensure that she will not end up giving up! Formula, bottles and nipples are NOT cheap!|`|2pxiK9waaa	You need somewhere for the baby to sleep. You can either have baby sleep in your bed (very hard habit to break, though) or you can buy a crib. <br>  <br>  Don't get an infant car seat, get a convertible seat so you only have to buy one seat. If you get an infant seat, then you'll eventually need a convertible seat, anyway. <br>  <br>  Stroller<br>  <br>  Everything else is extra<br>  <br>  Daily/Monthly expenses:<br>  diapers<br>  wipes<br>  diaper cream<br>  baby shampoo<br>  clothing<br>  childcare--if you both have jobs, then the baby's going to need to be in childcare of some sort and your girlfriend will need to pump her milk so you'll need bottles and a breast pump<br>  <br>  You have a few months to worry about expenses, so I'd start buying anytime you have extra and there are sales. You can stock up on diapers and wipes and even get your big items when they are on sale, too.|`|bspRfskYaa	You will need:<br>  a car seat, cot, pram - all of which you should be able to get second hand.  <br>  Don't bother with a moses basket, baby bath or bouncy chair as the baby will grow out of these things so quickly they are hardly worth having.  There is no need to buy a highchair until the baby is about 6 months old as you wont use it until then.<br>  Clothes: I would say at least 10 babygros and vests - just in case they throw up or poop.  also a coat, hat, mittens.<br>  About 5 8 oz bottles - it is better to get these larger bottles as the small 4oz bottles will only be useful when the baby is tiny, as they will want more as they get older.<br>  A sterilizer (although you can get bottles which you can sterilize in the microwave which would save you buying this)<br>  <br>  Things you will need to buy regularly - diapers, wet wipes, baby bubble bath and shampoo (1 bottle should last about 8 weeks) and obviously as the baby gets older baby food.<br>  <br>  Having a baby can be expensive but it doesn't have to be, you should be able to get almost every thing second hand.  Also if you know anyone who has a toddler ask them if they want to sell any of there stuff - most people are just happy to get rid of it once they dont need it any longer.<br>  <br>  Good luck with fatherhood!|`|aHBh67n6aa	second hand stores are great for baby clothes, my daughter has heaps of pre-loved outfits, and they are still in really good condition.. buying nappies in bulk can also work out to cheaper sometimes (and the expensive nappies arent always the best anyway) if you are planning on having a baby shower you could suggest to friends that if they want to give you a gift useful, baby supplies are the best option.. garage sales and 'for sale' sections in the newspaper are also good spots to go to for prams and cots and car seats, and you will save a heap, but just make sure it all meets the current safety standards...if she breastfeeds you will also save a heap of money, cos you wont have to buy formula and bottles.. if she is planning on going back to work i would suggest trying to find a nearby relative or friend who is willing and capable to babysit as child care centers can be very expensive... also look into any government payments you may be entitled to cos that little bit extra cash can go a long way.. good luck.. i know you guys will work it out and this baby will have loving and supportive parents and thats really all a baby needs...|`|Vbc60ADyaa	Sorry - I had a lot of ideas and my post is long  - but I'm sure it will help! :~)<br>  <br>  Second hand stores, online places (see links below), and Yard Sales in the summer are all great places to find baby items and baby clothes - babies grow quick in the first 2 years and need new clothes constantly....

It will all be worth it!|`|gaiCNtEFaa	The most important purchase you make is the car seat.  You can get a stroller/infant carrier combo.  Also a pack and play is better than a crib.  My son is 2 1/2 and still uses it when we travel.   I never purchased a high chair.  We got one of those little booster seats that have a tray.  They are 20 bucks, now we just scoot him up to the table.   Second hand stores that specialize in baby items are great.  They are usually pretty cheap, I do a lot of my clothes shopping there.  Things you need every month are diapers and wipes.  We started buying a pack a payday once we were in the 2nd trimester.  When you register for the baby shower be sure and ask for just the necessities, blankets, onsies, sleepers, towels, wash clothes, socks.|`|arnYXFADaa	that is sweet, you CAN do it. I did it alone, not rich, on WIC and my daughters great. If she's breast feeding you should be in pretty good shape. You'll never have them out of formula in the middle of the night worries (happened to me once =/ ). Make sure ur good on diapers and wipes also..<br>  Good Luck Sweetie|`|EhPRMuziaa	You could buy diapers and food at the 99 cent store|`|9rYjpIThaa	somewhere for him/her to sleep, clothes, dipers. go online to a baby store look at the prices and find things u can smartly deside u can go without|`|PbBWJGsTaa	don't worry, you will be able to afford all you need.<br>  <br>  -Somewhere for the baby to sleep - this can be your bed if you make it safe, or a second hand cot.<br>  <br>  -nappies  - go for a store brand disposable, about 70 per week for the first few weeks, or buy about 20 terry squares and 7-8 waterproof wraps.  This is the MUCH cheaper option, and is better for the babies bottom anyway.  Launder them in regular non bio detergent.<br>  <br>  -clothes for baby, buy a lot off ebay, they go for so cheap on there.<br>  <br>  -toys - don't worry about these for a long time, and even when baby starts to play, he/she will always find an empty box/coke bottle/old rag more fun than anything you have spent your money on.<br>  <br>  -breastfeeding means you wont have to pay anything at all for baby's food for at least the first 6 months.  Then just give baby a little of whatever your having, as long as its healthy.  <br>  <br>  -buggy - no real way around this one.  Again use ebay.  It will have to be suitable for a newborn to lie almost flat in so careful what you buy.  Another option is to use a cheap sling for the first few months, then buy a cheap regular pushchair.<br>  <br>  -wipes - make your own.  Cut up an old towel into squares, and keep them in a pile soaking in water.  Just wash them when used (along with the terry nappies if youre using those.<br>  <br>  -toiletries - don't waste any money buying anything special.  Babies only need a little olive oil as a moisturiser if they have dry skin, and just make sure your shower gel is a mild one that says its ok for the whole family (same for the shampoo).  Only use water to wash baby for the first month or two anyway.<br>  <br>  -highchair - again you will need one, use ebay.  If your place is small like mine, buy a second hand booster seat that doubles as a highchair, so it can just sit on top of one of your chairs.<br>  <br>  I think thats it.|`|TuIrAXLkaa	Been there. I was blessed My co workers gave me a baby shower. the most important thing is diapers and milk. get as many of the big boxes of diapers as you can. If you know someone with a sam club card they are cheaper there. the hospital can provide you with 2 or three cases of the already made formula bottles while shes in the hospital ask and they will give them to you for free me and my boyfriend racked up on stuff before we left the hospital. get food stamps and that will pay for the big cans of formula no need for a crib and all that wonderful expensive clutter but if you want one go to the resale shops and find a cheap bassinet and swing. 4 or 5 one peice sets or if your wife stays home cloth diapers are okay hand wash them and use them again. Most importantly get whatever you can at the hospital before you go home the wic office can also provide a car seat for the baby all you do is go in and watch a video on safety and the fire department puts the seat in whatever car your in before you leave the hospital. Find someone with old baby clothes and they will be glad to give them to you. I was so blessed I didnt haft to buy anything for a year. If you ask people will give God always makes a  way for families with babies I started with nothing. I couldnt afford anything. people will just give if you ask. bottles towels wash clothes and please get a thermometer so that you can check the babies temp some things you dont haft to run to the doc for.|`|2iXuzHgwaa	First of all, congrats! As a mom myself, and I got pregnant when I was sixteen and I'm eighteen now, you never know how much love your heart can hold until someone calls you mommy or daddy. Okay, if you have smoking habbits, you may have to cut back or get on medicine to stop before the baby arrives, one, its bad for the baby, and two, it would save you a lot of money. Or you can go to the salvage army, they have canned goods and things to feed you, and your baby if you still have a need when he or she is older and off the breastfeeding, foodstamps give you money to buy weekly groceries and anything else food related you may need.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	borrow anything you can-crib,swing etc. also goodwill is a good place to get stuff. another thing-you really dont have to have a crib-a pack n play works just as well and has a changing table with it. at least most of them do. you could also check to see if there are any programs that can help you out with baby supplies like the salvation army or possibly the united way. as far as monthly expenses go-you will need diapers,wipes,formula or a breast pump, and then eventually baby food. my wic nurse told me that in september they are going to start including baby food in the wic package. another thing you can do is ask your insurance company if they cover a breast pump. mine did and its really nice. you dont need to buy name brand diapers and wipes either. we buy the walmart brand of diapers and they work great for us,the wipes are ok too. and of course -rummage sales! good luck! i have never found raising children to be that expensive-especially if you dont need everything to be new or name brand!|`|xpUyH0psaa	absolutely need:<br>  baby wipes<br>  breast pump<br>  clothes<br>  diapers<br>  soap/ shampoo<br>  blankets<br>  car seat<br>  baby bottles<br>  <br>  some hospitals give infant car seats, blankets, bottle of already mixed formula milk, nipples, diapers so maybe you may want to ask in advance. baby can sleep with you guys and can be carried if you guys are going out so stoller and crib are not absolutely necessary.

rTACLd3Saa	Hi there. First of all, relax! It's not as bad travelling with an infant as people make it out to be. I just returned last Saturday afternoon from a two week trip to Hawaii (I live in CT). I was quite worried about most of the same concerns you have. I flew alone with my 9 1/2 month old daughter. We flew American Airlines from CT to St Louis (4 hour layover), to LA (only 30 min to catch our connection to Honolulu). We left CT at 11:30 AM EST and didn't get into our hotel in Waikiki (40 min from Honolulu) until about 1:30 AM Hawaii Time (5 hours behind EST). A few days later we flew on Hawaian Air to Kauai for another week then did the entire thing in reverse to get back home on Saturday. I was pleasantly surprised that Avary did awesome! She didn't cry or even fuss much at all. The trick is to give a bottle or breastfeed on takeoff and landing. It is tough to time it right. Just make sure baby is hungry at those times. For the short flights, I gave my daughter her formula bottle on takeoff and something she loves like apple juice or her favorite yogurt drink on landing (to make sure she took it). There were also times when she fell asleep while the plane was taxying and I didn't wake her up to give her the bottle. She did fine without it... but if baby is awake, definitely give her the bottle or at least a paci if she takes one.<br>  <br>  As soon as you get to the airport and check your bags, go to the gate you will be departing from. If you are travelling with your daughter as a lap child, at the gate, ask if there is an open seat next to yours or if not, perhaps there are two seats together elsewhere on the plane. I was fortunate enough to have an open seat next to me on every single flight! If that is the case, you will be allowed to bring your daughter onto the plane in her carseat and she will have her own seat (FOR FREE) - which is a lot easier for you! Regulations require that the infant in the carseat sit in the window seat though, so she won't block the exit path in case of emergency. I still brought my daughter's sling and Baby Bjorn in case she wanted to be held though (in the carry on), and in your case, that's an awfully long flight so I'm sure you will want it.<br>  <br>  Definitely bring the stroller. It is great for piling everything onto as you go through the airport. A couple times I had my daughter in her Baby Bjorn carrier and I just put the carry ons in the stroller but most of the time I had her in her carseat and attached to the stroller with her diaper bag, my purse, etc underneath in the basket. It was so easy! When you get to the gate (after you ask about the seat next to you being open) they will give you tags for your stroller and the carseat (if there is no seat open next to you, you will have to stow that under the plane with the stroller - but there is NO charge for either). They will give you a copy of the tag as a claim check for when you get off the plane. Usually, though there are only a couple passengers with strollers stowed under the plane so you won't even need that claim check. Either a flight attendant or even the pilot may go get the stroller from under the plane and bring it up to you right where you get off the plane. You just wait there (there will probably be wheelchairs there too). Sometimes they try to rush you along, but just take your time. I was by myself and I had to load up the stoller before I could go anywhere so I just went as quickly as possible but don't let them make you feel like you have to rush. <br>  <br>  For the food items, bring whatever you need to be comfortable. One tip about bottles is if you have any of the Playtex Drop In type bottles, it is so much easier. You don't have to worry about cleaning it out, just replace the liner and bring extra nipples so you dont have to worry about cleaning it on the plane. (Bring plastic bags for garbage (and diapers) and ziplocs for dirty nipples). I had tons of glass and plastic baby food containers, powdered and liquid formula (some already open, some not), some bottles ready to go and some not, bottled water, etc. I even got to bring a banana and some juice along because I said it was for the baby. Basically, anything that is for the baby they will allow. They will most likely make you take everything that is liquid, powder or gel (like water, baby food, formula etc) out of the carry-ons and put them in a separate bin. They will do a special check on all of those items but should not open anything that will spoil. One lady wanted to open the yogurt I had for my daughter and I said no, it will spoil and they said it was fine.  <br>  <br>  Of course, double check everything with your airline before you fly as some have different regs and you want to be prepared.  And as for the other passengers on the plane, there isn't much you can do if yor baby decides to cry.  Once I got up and paced the aisle with my daughter to calm her down but for the most part she didn't fuss much at all.  Bring some light, small, easy to pack toys - I fou|`|08GDBedGaa	we'v just returned from the carribean and we're in europe, so quite a long flight with our 5 month old baby, she was a dream, i breastfeed, so i stuck her on the boobie, for take off and landing to avoid and ear problems, but thankfully we were in first class so we had a bit more room as she had to be on our laps, but also our girl is a really chilled out, a dream baby, some would say, so it depends on the child!! but remember you'll need to entertain her as much as possible, the few times my girl seemed bored, we'd give her a feed if she would take let her watch a cartoon on the litlle dvd player you get, just to entertain or a plastic cup, we wouldnt normally let her watch tv but it does distract her,:) good luck|`|KZNVb7ehaa	ive taken my baby on 2 round trips and she is only 7 months old. i would just make bring empty bottles and buy bottled water after i went through security. try to feed baby when you are taking off and when you are landing. the first plane ride she slept almost the whole time.  shes an excellent baby though.  did not hardly cry at all.  i would suggest bringing books so you can read to your baby.
P1xlrvAaaa	No it isn't mandatory but you might want to bring anyone for support.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	My hospital calls them 'support person" that's what their there for.<br>  <br>  If you want to go it alone, then I'm sure it's fine by hospitals.|`|82BSdiyCaa	Not where I live, but they do usually want you to have someone with you while being discharged.<br>  <br>  But, I would suggest asking a friend, or someone close to you, to be there as support.

I would advise taking someone that you feel will be a good support such as your best friend or mum etc though as I wouldn't recommend doing it by yourself no matter how strong you are!

wyAtVqbOaa	First of all it wasn't your decision - it takes to to have sex and become pregnant and if he really didn't want a child then he should have used a better form of contraception than relying on you.  <br>  <br>  I have to admit that you haven't said that when you found out your pregnant he was pleased - you just said that he would be there for you.  That doesn't sound as if he was pleased the first time round.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure that he will come round - please don't get me wrong - I really hope that I'm wrong.  He may warm to the idea but the fact that when you discovered you were pregnant he said that he would stand by you, then he has told you to have an abortion, he had no reaction when you were at the ultrasound and then he keeps telling you that it was your decision to have this child.  <br>  <br>  Go ahead with the pregnancy with or without him.  You have the support of your family and friends.  Just make sure that you get monies from him that you are due.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|GL5MOqDKaa	give him some time<br>  because you can not force him to be ready.<br>  if u force him, things will probably turn out worse.|`|91hxNCfWaa	You have the support of your family which is a lot, I agree with your mom that he'll probably come around to the idea of the new baby eventually. Try not to dwell on him, you're going to be a mommy! :)|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I think he's being really selfish to say that it's your choice, not his.  He made the choice to potentially have your child when he made the choice to have sex.  <br>  <br>  I would give him the option to not be involved as a parent though.  If he wants, he can disappear from your lives forever - you're lucky enough to have this option with such a great support system.  When he sees that he has a choice, he will make the right one.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	it depends what you knocked him out with.<br>  if it was just a punch to the right temple then yes he will,but if it was with an iron,but not one like in the cartoons then probably no. call the ambulance service now while he still has a chance of survival.|`|BqqDJXkjaa	"We" can raise a baby, but "we" can not have an abortion. Only YOU have the abortion.<br>  <br>  I went through the same thing - my now husband seemed (not entierly happy but) OK with the idea that I was pregnant and he didn't say anything about an abortion until I had told everyone. I guess it worked out, as we're married now and he's crazy about her but when ever we get into an argument over household chores he always wants to make the comment that I'm the one that wanted to have kids. <br>  <br>  We can not rely on men to make us happy. He probably will come around - no normal person can resist their own child if they get to know them - but he's just going to make things stressful in the meantime. <br>  <br>  I think you should sit down with him and explain that you're having this baby and if he is not going to be 100% supportive then to please leave. <br>  He can be involved in the childs life later, but if he dosn't support one of the biggest moments in your lives then how can you really live happily with him???|`|OEqxVXYVaa	FORGET about him he is a total jerk i believe you can raise you baby in your own + you have a supporting family be happy with what you have instead of worring about that jerk!|`|bwoVogaOaa	well....DO NOT HAVE AN ABORTION!<br>  and if he doesnt come around at least you have your fam and friends there for you!<br>  :)<br>  be strong!<br>  hopefully he will!<br>  Good luck!<br>  :))|`|ex5lOig7aa	All depends on the guy to be honest.<br>  <br>  But if he feels he isn't ready for this, then this may drive you two apart.|`|VwryR8VJaa	It takes a big part in some one to go against another person on this I thinnk that you are really brave for going against what he wanted. I am against abortions and it's a 50-50 chance of him coming around but he needs to sit down and think just because the baby is in your tummy and not your arms doesn't mean it isn't a human. He was man enough to have sex with you, if he didn't want a baby he shouldn't have  had sex. He can do that then he needs to step up and be a man or go elsewhere.

Maybe you are imagining it..........|`|2osuEr0naa	I think it's so funny how people come on yahoo answers will the dumbest situations.

Don't say its rape if you are just trying to explain why you don't know who the father is and why you had 4 partners.  But if it IS rape, don't let the jerks get away with it!  Don't be ashamed.

Ovulation typically occurs about 12 to 16 days before your next period starts, so assuming you are correct about the start date of your next period, you would have ovulated about 6 to 10 days ago. If that is the case there is no chance of becoming pregnant from intercourse today.|`|ir0qEV3waa	would have thought so do a test when ur P is due x

da498dbd39048a1057d2c4954514a889aa	I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and I am always parnoid as well when I cannot feel him moving around.

3F8f1SoQaa	I would not worry about that one thing. My oldest son IS on the autism spectrum and did not line things up. My 3 year old does on occasion sit there and line things up and there is NO indication that he has any issues other than his speech delay...<br>  <br>  if you are really worried you can call early intervention for a child under 3 or the local elementary school for a child over age 3 and ask for her to be evaluated.|`|3tWlbje7aa	Sounds fairly typical of what the child psychologist Piaget called a "schema". <br>  <br>  "To cope with the physical world, children shape the world and are shaped by it through building schemas to which they assimilate new knowledge" (reference below). Personally I would regard it as one of those fascinating and lovable quirks that children often have.|`|eim4KsAKaa	it could either be that, 1, she is very organized (which could come in handy at times) or, 2, it could be autism, because that one of the signs of autism<br>  if you are worried about autism, talk to her doctor|`|xubIaiZaaa	i worked in a daycare with 2-3 yr olds, many did this, i think its normal, some even liked putting them from big to little, smart really. :)|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Because she can!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I dont want to sound rude but i read that that could be a sign of autism...or it could be just what she likes to do i would definitely talk to a doctor!|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	sounds like she might just be organized :0)-i would ask her dr if you are worried about autism
B9KwqnuDaa	It means she is getting a lot of fore milk and not enough hind milk. It's not a huge deal every now and then but I find it makes them a bit more gassy. You need to nurse on the same breast for longer so your baby will have time to get the hind milk. This was sort of an issue with my first son for a bit because my let down was so strong that he was almost full by the time he got any hind milk.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	My daughter has green poop until she was three, if I gave her apple juice.  If I cut it with water, she did not poop green<br>  <br>  It could be something you eat or drink|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If she is breast fed you need to make sure she's emptying your breast before switching sides - she's not getting enough hindmilk that has all the fat.   When babies don't get enough hind milk, or fat in their diet, the bile that is released from the gallbladder goes straight through instead of being re-absorbed with the fatty globules (bile salts are made from the break down of hemoglobin, to help with the absorption of fats).|`|AA12193113	I fed my 8 month old son banana/berry baby food and his poop has a purple tint to it lol.  Babies that young are just starting to get their digestive tract working.  I'm sure it's normal for their stools to be brown, green/brown, or mustard color.|`|B5MDTdtPaa	my daughters 5 months and has had green poo every day for months - its fine its jsut baby poop - my baby is on speical lactrose free formula though so that may be why... :) x|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Its normal.  It has to do with iron in their system.|`|w3ob12X6aa	my daughter is almost 3 months and that happens sometimes its perfectly normal nothing to worry about,does she seem to be in any distress? if not its fine. if she is breastfed it could be somthing you ate or if shes not then it could be just green poop.
PIfaJRuoaa	Mine was always sucking his thumb on my ultrasounds and sticks his fingers or hand in his mouth now.  Just recently he learned how to stick his thumb out and suck on that, I suppose it just depends on your baby.  My pediatrician said she preferred my son suck his thumb rather than his pacifier but I don't mind, whichever he prefers.  Lol.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	It's hard to tell. My daughter sucked on her hand and her thumb a lot (refused a pacifier) she's 7 months old now and doesn't really suck on anything anymore. Occasionally she'll suck on her thumb if she's overly exhausted..but it's rare.|`|X6as2nOAaa	He is only 11 weeks so I doubt that would determine if he will be one or not, they just like things in their mouths around these ages, when he gets around a year and is still sucking then I would try to get him not to but for now he is still to young.|`|rjVALevtaa	Probably not. Either way, it's too early to tell. Babies have a natural urge to suck, even when they aren't hungry. This urge tends to lessen by 1 year old.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Not necessarily. Babies just have that natural reflex to suck or chew on anything that comes to their mouths. Congrats on the beautiful new baby!|`|6ErVPePEaa	Newborns have the natural reflex to put their hands in their mouths... It is a comfort thing for them. He will probably grow out of it|`|hIzQyflqaa	hes probably teething!|`|AA11749212	Babies suck to sooth themselves, and it does not necessarily mean he will be a thumb sucker.  My Daughter sucked her fingers to get herself to sleep for about a year, then stopped.  I think it is important for babies to learn to sooth themselves, they do it very early while growing in the uterus too!  <br>  <br>  Congratulations on a handsome boy!|`|s0bVwVn9aa	lol my little man does this also.. he is 11 weeks will be 12 on the 28th.. i always try and stick his pacifier in his mouth..lol when he sucks his hands they get all red and raw. but ever chance he gets his hands are right there.. i dunno if he will be a thumb sucker i think they are just starting to notice everthing.|`|3aOSvS3Zaa	i think most babies suck on their hand at some point but my little girl started out like this and she is a thumb sucker. Maybe he is starting to teeth.
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	There is nothing to do about your breasts except to make sure that your bra is comfortable and is a good fit, make sure it isnt tight. For a lot of women later in the pregnancy the soreness will get a little better. For the stuffy nose I have that symptom and at 37 weeks I still have it, my midwife told me to use saline nose spray but to be honest it really didnt help me much. The nights that it is really bad I take benadryl because that is safe to take during pregnancy but I dont take it everynight just when my nose gets really bad. Good luck.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Nothing you can do about either of them, you just have to suffer through it, oh the joys of pregnancy....<br>  <br>  Just wait there is more fun to come...|`|plI0WOrUaa	nasal congestion is totally normal.  I find using a humidifier at night really helps with that.  I can't breathe through my nose at night without it!  The sore breasts will ease off a bit.  I had to wear my bra at night, which i hated, but it helped with the real pain in the morning.  giving added support to your breasts at night will help.  In the meantime, tylenol helps, and avoid salt and a lot of sugar, which will help you retain water and make your breasts hurt more.|`|05hddkH2aa	Hi, Congrats !!<br>  <br>   Theres not to much you can do about your sore breasts, unfortunately. I wouldnt take meds in your first trimester but you can use a saline nose spray and prop your head up a little bit with more pillow. Im 29 weeks pregnant and my nose is still stuffy. Good Luck :)|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I would try wearing a sports bra that worked for me!...and yes a stuffy nose part of pregnancy i would wait it out or u can talk to ur doctor he might prescribe u something but most doctors dont!
2wyDALHgaa	There are essentially two major ways to adopt a child in Canada.  One can adopt through your local Dept of Social Services (or what ever name it goes by) and/or some other public social services agencies.  This way is generally either free or very low cost (under $500 which is just to cover a few of the external checks that are required).  You can also adopt through a private agency which, from what I understand, can cost around $20,000 or more.  <br>  <br>  Each Province has their own websites for their particular Dept of Child Welfare so depending upon where you live you can just to a search and find them.  They should give you all the info you need for a dept adoption in your province.  I've included a link to the one in Alberta as well as Catholic Social Services which should also be in each Province.<br>  <br>  In Sept 07 my wife and I started the process to "foster to adopt" and we were formally approved in early Jan 08.  The license (as a foster home) was issued in mid Feb 08 and within a day of that happening we had a 4 day old placed with us.  The mother was unable or unwilling to address her issues so the baby was placed for adoption and by the time she was 6 months old the adoption was completed.  The cost to us for all of this was $0.  I fully admit that ours was just a lucky set of circumstances that lead to us getting a baby (an age bracket we didn't specifically request) and getting it done so quickly but the fact of the matter is that it can work this fast or it can take longer, the child could be younger or older.  It's all a matter of fate, what you are looking for and where the need is.  If we had tried to do the same adoption through a private agency it would have cost thousands and taken, potentially, years.<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions feel free to contact me through my profile if you want and I can answer them through there.|`|GPkcg8Rqaa	If you're adopting a child from Canada (and you live here) then you don't have to pay anything...<br>  <br>  I've never adopted but have looked into it...and know someone who has...<br>  <br>  it's a very long process to officially adopt an infant...often you will be a foster parent first and the birth parents have I think 2 years to have their child back (example the mother is a junkie and has cleaned up her act)<br>  <br>  after that the adoption process begins...I think there are certain rules to be eligible too...like married two years...and certain age restrictions.<br>  it's also quicker the older the child is...or if the child is a visible minority or has a disability....<br>  <br>  I think this site would be helpful: <a href="http://www.adoption.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoption.ca/</a><br>  <br>  good luck!
JvOMktgMaa	no it doesnt hurt at all.. you can get the pill to take which causes miscarrige or you get put to sleep, only for a couple of minutes then its done with! you feel a bit drowsey after and mabe a few cramps and a bit of a bleed..then they let you go home.x|`|gq6omW7taa	It hurts really bad. (the surgical one) The pill also does because you are giving yourself a miscarriage.<br>  It hurts more than child birth because you don't get any meds.  And even if you did it would still hurt bad after.<br>  It feels like someone is ripping something out of you which is what is happening.<br>  They put a vacuuming in you and suck it out and while that is happening it is tearing the fetus from your uterus and basically shredding the fetus in tiny pieces.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you see it isn't good.|`|Ltx89w04aa	A friend of mine had an abortion, and I supported her through it.<br>  <br>  First, you can get one with or without anesthesia.  If you get it without anesthesia, it hurts.  Even with anesthesia, it will hurt afterward.<br>  <br>  It's nothing like childbirth.<br>  <br>  She had the anesthesia, so I dunno what "it felt like".  She cramped and bled afterward, but she ended up fine.<br>  <br>  What they do depends on the kind of abortion.  Not sure how hers was done.|`|IogJBs2Naa	I suppose it depends on how far the pregnancy had progressed and what kind of abortion.  I'm sure it hurts physically and even more emotionally.|`|DTKYVz4qaa	only for the baby|`|WyzKYvthaa	no|`|K1JKOGo9aa	Physically, no.  Emotionally, yes.  Plus there are some really bad side effects that can happen, like never being able to have children again.

2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	Taurine is very well known to be concentrated in the human brain during infancy, so it is imperative that babies get proper amounts.<br>  Taurine is not an amino acid, but it is similar and is actually called a sulfonic acid. It serves many functions:<br>  It is a component of bile acids, needed to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Maintains cell membrane stability. Regulates heartbeat. Prevents brain cell over-activity. Improves utilization of glucose and insulin regulation. Needed for the development of the nervous system. Regulates nerve/muscle interaction. Assists in modulating the activity of cyclic AMP. Regulates calcium metabolism in the heart. Functions as an antioxidant.|`|xEXb96UKaa	it's in it because the baby needs it. my son is on Neocate, an amino acid based formula for babies with multiple protein allergies and it has  no animal ingredients or soy either for that matter. but taurine is also added to this formula, though the taurine added to the Neocate is manufactured not sourced from animals.|`|rAkWoweOaa	<a href="http://www.mercola.com/article/children/taurine_infants.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/article/children/...</a><br>  <br>  If human breastmilk ingredients were listed, the list would be long as well and Taurine would be on the list.|`|FidZNMmUaa	This is why we should breastfeed.<br>  <br>  It comes from Oxen.

clFTA9fDaa	To be honest, a lot of guys don't like when your too close to their friends. It hurts their ego and makes their mind wander about what your talking about when he's not around. Drives him crazy really...<br>  Talk to him. I know everyone will tell you that, but really! Say to him that you have no interest in these other guys other than being friends, and ask him why he gets so upset about it.<br>  (But don't say what's the big deal, they'll freak haha)<br>  Hope this helped!|`|AA11112131	It is a classic case of LOW self esteem.

You cannot change how he feels.|`|I64JOuMKaa	your boyfriend probably thinks you're getting TOO close to him and that maybe you will fall for the other guy.<br>  <br>  Just tell your boyfriend that if he loves you , he will trust you and that he has nothing to worry about cause he's the only guy for you !|`|6lSbmXunaa	Hi Vee!<br>  <br>  As much as they hate to admit it, some people are just the jealous type. Don't get me wrong, it's not always a bad thing. I myself am a jealous sort of person, even with my friends. Don't get too upset with his attitude, because I'm sure if he was hanging out with a lot of other pretty girls and getting close to them, you would feel yourself getting a little jealous.  It's human nature. So anyways, I'll stop babbling. Just tell him exactly what you told us, and let him know how much he means to you.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped and let me know if you need anything else! Have a nice week :)
4cehW3S9aa	Any time you are on a group plan you are covered once it kicks in.<br>  <br>  As for the cost...it can be pricey especially if they want to do an ultrasound right away.  I was almost 9w before my first appointment.  If you schedule an appt and it takes almost a month to get in, you will only have to pay for one.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the pregnancy!|`|iTaW6d6Waa	BCBS will cover you and your baby. As far as the cost of the appointments I am not sure.
ZCSOJUYVaa	Dont feel bad about any of that!! The best thing that your children have is you as a mommy!! Breastfeeding is something that alot of people cannot do, I know I struggled with my first child, and ended up having to pump. And with my others my milk supply totally diminished after about a month. Every time you start feeling down about yourself, look at yous kids, you created such amazing little lifes, and nothing can take that away from you! Stick in there hon, it will all be okay!!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You're human, not Wonder Woman.  Relax.  Your kids will never remember whether their milk came from a breast or a bottle.  They don't see you as a failure, I promise.<br>  <br>  Put away negative thoughts.  I'm not into the New Age stuff, but any doctor will tell you attitude matters.  And with three kids and medical stress, you haven't got time for that!<br>  <br>  I hope the results are good.  If they aren't, it's even more important that you concentrate on good things, like your husband and kids!  <br>  <br>  God bless.|`|GPkcg8Rqaa	You are just as much of a woman as anyone else...<br>  <br>  I may never be able to carry a child due to severe endometriosis...count your blessings my dear....|`|nzgZR6onaa	Listen dear when I decided to breast feed in 1978 a lot of mothers from the fifties tried to talk me out of it.That was the bottle era for sure. Hey and we bottle babies turned out fine! I do not love my mother any less. I don't even know the difference. Its loving your child and that's the most important. You can still hold your baby close and snuggle during bottle feeding. Who wrote the book that says you are less of a woman if you don't breast feed.Please hon don't beat yourself up.I was hospitalized when my son was a baby and he had to be put on a bottle because I was to sick to continue breastfeeding. My sister tried and after a few months developed problems and had to stop and that happens a lot to women it does not make them any less of a woman.So please be kinder and more understanding to yourself ok!
EqrpIU68aa	OMG i feel so sorry for you. I would shout at them but i say that but i wouldn't be able to. Try talkin to your mum if you manage to find any of her time. maybe even if shes in the shower draw the curtains and sit on the floor/toilet, this way you can't see her and she can't see you or try your dad. if tht doesnt help then try giving really blunt hints..... pretend to find the bill to take aways and shout geez thats a lot of money your paying dad or i dont know i have a headache when people talk.  (lol i sound like a *****)<br>  <br>  I had this kind of situation but they didnt come round and eat my food they just took my mum away kind of thing, horrible to me and stuff like tht.<br>  <br>  hope this helps i'm really giving my all. i feel for you.<br>  u got msn? u can chat to me sometimes. ^^|`|ijuPWHMdaa	I NED SE MOR|`|vDKZeMBYaa	Ugh, I feel your pain. My mom's friends used to be over allll the time. Eventually, I got so sick of it I started yelling and complaining to her. Finally, she got the message and wouldn't call her. But, I would be rude to the other people. Like I would hide stuff just so they wouldn't eat or take anything.  But, ya I hope it helps you.|`|wuiy45Wsaa	I'm so sorry for you. I'm not really sure what I would do either. I would try to sit down with your mom and explain it to her - maybe she and her friends could go out together. Explain that she can spend time with her friends, but not invite them over every day. Get your dad to help too - but explain this calmly and logically. For you, I would try to get out of the house. Go over to a friends, to some after-school club. Best of luck!|`|sz5J9V6aaa	Put passwords on everything, hide the phones and be mean to the kids. Whenever the kids do something you don't like, go give out to them and be mean.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	It's obvious that these people are using your family for things they cannot afford. <br>  They probably have nice hair, nails and clothes but won't spend on what is necessary.<br>  They also have no respect for your home or belongings.<br>  Talk to your dad about going out to eat (somewhere cheap) for a week instead of buying groceries. He should also talk to your mom about putting a stop to this.<br>  Print out this question and show it to your parents so they can read how upset you are.<br>  <br>  Also hide the phone and take a wire off of your dad's computer so she can't use it. When she puts her feet on the couch tell her "we don't do that in this house." <br>  When she goes thru the cupboards say "you didn't pay for anything in there, it is not polite to go thru other people's cupboards"<br>  When she sits on the counters say 'we don't do that in this house"<br>  If she gets mad, just say "you can go home and do those things but not here."<br>  Keep the doors locked on all bedrooms.<br>  <br>  After a while they will find someone else to mooch off of. <br>  <br>  I have known people like this and it's hard to get rid of them once you give them something. You have to be strict but not rude.
nkM6wmv6aa	i think i just threw up in my mouth. fresh and feminine? by sticking 'shay' in the middle or boy's names? and please say the apostrophes aren't actually part of the name...<br>  <br>  i literally don't know what to say.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	I don't understand why you would want to add a "shay" in the middle of names, but don't you think it'll get teased at school?<br>  I know you don't want to hear this but maybe your partner is right...|`|AA10847209	Some suggestions for girls: there's always Rat-risha  ( a REAL name!)  or Brieajanique Quan Yan ( also real names )|`|8WbfmK5daa	I don't really understand. It doesn't seem to really work.<br>  <br>  Why don't you just use<br>  <br>  Shay<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  Shayla <br>  <br>  for a girl|`|85gJHDbNaa	In all honestly, I hate every single one of those names. Making stuff up and sticking shay in the middle of perfectly good names seems tacky to me, and doesn't flow well. If your better half doesn't like any of them, don't use an of them. Danielle or Michelle are fine names on their own, don't name your kid something stupid.|`|X3rQJhVMaa	No idea what you asking? Is Mi`shay`chael a name?  Or do you  mean Michelle. I dont like those name because I  dont get the commons and such.

Why are you just now needing a name for your daughter when she is starting school in the fall & what have you, your partner, family, & friends been calling her all these years?

Z0odTlyQaa	Shouldn't they teach you this in health class? <br>  <br>  Well obviously, as you stated, abstinence would be most effective, but after that, I think it would actually be the Nuva Ring, because it leaves the least room for human error.|`|xbgCwmbdaa	Condoms with a spermicide, along with taking birth control pills.|`|YIbELNRBaa	Condoms and birth control pills.

If you are not having sex, and have problems with menstruation that i would refer you to YAZ. That is what I take. I have very heavy periods and i get every symptom of a period. Yaz is a birth control but I also has thing in it for camping, mood swings, bloating, and also acne. The only thing is that you have to take it everyday, so that mean you have to remember to take that pill. Which is sometimes hard for me to remember everyday in my busy schedule sometimes. But really its best to talk to a doctor and they will decide which form is best for you.|`|rwhqgTB6aa	Birth control pills can have a lot of good side effects in addition to pregnancy prevention. If you think you may become sexually active in the near future you should talk to your doctor now about starting the pill. If and when you decide to become sexually active you should use a barrier method (condoms) to further reduce your risk of pregnancy as well as sexually transmitted diseases. It's good that you're thinking ahead. Talk to an adult (your parents, doctor, teacher, etc) if you can for more information and support. Good luck.|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	Birth control pills, condoms, and spermicide (used at the same time).

IwTgq3ezaa	I'm due July 29th, with our 3rd, as well. I felt both of my boys move much more before now. With this baby, I get little flutters, or a little thump now & then, but nothing like I did with my last 2 pregnancies. I've asked my doctor and nurse about it and they both agree that each pregnancy is different, each baby is different, and it's normal to feel varying degrees of movement with each pregnancy. I felt one big thump the other night and got so excited! It was like baby was saying, yeah I'm here, lol. Hang in there, it's normal. Before we both know it, we'll be complaining about not getting any sleep because of all the movement! lol Congrats to you!|`|Ev9Rnm0Xaa	hun baby is only small and every baby is different,he may just not be an active baby.i have heard a hot drink help or a very cold drink,this is what midwife told me and aparently it helps if you want them to move aorund,sure all will be fine,good luck xx|`|FEg0PDdnaa	Drink some juice, try apple juice and then lay down for a while and see if the baby starts kicking more.

Until then, the baby has so much room and fluid to move in, it's not likely that the mom will feel the movements all that much.  Just make sure you're taking care of yourself, eating lots of fresh fruits and veggies, lean meats and whole grains and stay well hydrated until you can get more detailed information from you doctor.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|plI0WOrUaa	I think its normal.  Not every pregnancy will be the same, so try not to worry too much.  Its normal not to feel movement yet.  Its only time to worry when you are past 23-24weeks and aren't feeling movement.  I'm sure that the ultrasound and doctors appointment will ease your mind!  Plus, you'll be hearing the baby's heartbeat at your doctors right, so that will help.  I'm sure you are fine, but good luck with baby #3!! :)|`|PElSsv7Maa	i feel you should try some sugary stuff like sweet apple or grape juice or even candy helps...rest for a while and see ..this might lead the baby to kick more...if the baby does not move much, it is better to call your ob-gyn and let her know!<br>  don't worry everything will be fine if u stay strong! Good luck! I will pray for u and ur baby!:) so cheer up sweet mommy!!|`|DoaMYpfMaa	drink more fluids the more there is the more the child has to play with:) just breath and take it easy not all pregnancies are the same

eXsR8Gx5aa	That is very similar to what my 7mo old has sounds fine - you can start offering more adventurous foods now too if you like, a little yoghurt, some cheese sauce - my son had a 3 bean & veg chilli (mild) yesterday & loved it!! <br>  there is also nothing wrong with saying boobie - lol me & my friends say it all the time, must be a UK thing huh?|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Yea that sounds ok to me, it seems like ur doin a good job with weanin her onto solids, :D.  And lol how immature that peeps can't take someone sayin boobie, i think it sounds cute too, :D.|`|ZzyEhSB1aa	Every child is different but so long as your baby is content.<br>  <br>  If you are breastfeeding - just make sure that you are having a fully nutritious diet so that your baby gets good quality milk.<br>  <br>  I breastfed my baby for 2 years - there were absolutely no problems in weaning.<br>  Well done for breastfeeding, you're giving your baby the best start in life!|`|yIdgG8b1aa	it sounds fine to me, very hectic though.i am bottle feeding not breast so i don't understand the rules of eating but i am only feeding 6 times a day and when she is old enough to go on solids i cut down on her milk. if you are not bothered by your busy schedule though then yeah sounds healthy and a good routine to me :)|`|FidZNMmUaa	It sounds rediculous when you say "boobie."

BOOBIE :)|`|i6gZ5GQgaa	I wish I got "boobie" that often.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	Boobie? Are you kidding me? How old are you, 11? I can't stand it when women  say "boobie" or "boob" when it comes to breast feeding. Ridiculous...
LUg9dgb5aa	Well, its not outrageous. Its just their way of parenting.<br>  and your friend was probably getting alot of texts, from<br>  friends and her parents or whatever must have heard it,<br>  and simply replied. it doesnt always mean, they are snooping.<br>  but, your right it is a matter of privacy :)<br>  <br>  Anyways, to answer your questions;<br>  1. I dont really get my phone taken away. She has only done it<br>  once, and only for like 25 minutes. I had practically begged for<br>  her to give it back, lmfao. <br>  Yes, i give her the whole thing. <br>  No, i dont take out the battery.<br>  Yes, i lock my phone.<br>  No, i dont erase messages.<br>  I really dont have anything to hide, but i just dont<br>  like my mom looking at my stuff. Its my stuff, right?<br>  <br>  2. I'd tell her, why'd she do that? As long as she's not<br>  having a full on conversation with someone tho, it doesnt really<br>  bother me.<br>  <br>  3. Well, i dont think its THAT BIG OF A DEAL. but, yes i see what<br>  you mean. It is a sense of privacy, and i would hate that too. But,<br>  maybe her parents werent meaning to text with her phone you know?<br>  But eitherway, yes its a matter of privacy. I'd lock my phone, or<br>  something! :)<br>  <br>  Hope your friend getss her phone back!<br>  &`? (:|`|kRaVa0Wraa	1.What do you do when your parents take your cell phone away?<br>  i wait until they leave the room, then call it and find out where they hid it. then i take it back.<br>  <br>  Do you give them the whole thing?<br>  yes<br>  <br>  Do you take the battery?<br>  no<br>  <br>  Do you lock it?<br>  no<br>  <br>  Erase the messages?<br>  no.<br>  <br>  2.What if you found out that your parents were intercepting text messages like that?<br>  be pissed. invasion of privacy much?<br>  <br>  3.What do you think about this?<br>  STUPID|`|LTWlBSFNaa	i delete everything when they take it<br>  i would kill my mom|`|UZKg2odzaa	i'm 19 and my parents have never taken my phone away<br>  but if they did then i would delete all of the messages/anything that i wouldn't want them seeing. but yeah, i basically could not live more than a couple hours without my phone. so i'd be pretty pissed.|`|cBwdYXtmaa	Haha, funny story, my parents think I'm some sweet angel that's perfect or something, because when she went in my phone while i was in the shower, read all my texts, and because i said f*ck she took my phone away for 2 weeks. XD.<br>  I'm a teen, so here ya go.<br>  1. I delete everything on there now, and just don't let them take it... :p or I kill the battery then give it to them, but dead.<br>  2. I was PISSED!!!! I don't think I talked to my mom for a few days. I ate dinner in my room, I was so mad. Kids are entitled to privacy, and because I (or your friend) had not done anything to mistrust them, they shouldn't be going through your phone.<br>  3. I think kids are entitled to privacy and that its ridiculous to take away their phone if there hasn't been anything to mistrust them.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	well you sound like a brat<br>  until you move out, you have no phone<br>  "your" phone, is really my phone<br>  im just lending it to you<br>  i can take it away whenever i want, do whatever i want, wherever i want<br>  my kids, do NOT have a pw on their cellphone<br>  i have the right to go through it, for their safety<br>  <br>  1. When you take your teens cell phone away what do you do with it?<br>  i take it, look at who their contacts are<br>  Do you just shut it off and hide it somewhere? <br>  sort of<br>  Do you go through it(contacts, pics, messages) and then shut it off?<br>  Yes, yes i do<br>   Do you keep it on and see what comes through?<br>  yes<br>  What if your teen shut it off and then handed it to you? <br>  i would turn it on<br>  What if you turned it on and found it locked? <br>  i would unlock it<br>  What if you saw the inbox and outbox empty?<br>  i don't care,<br>  Would you ever intercept messages like that?<br>  its not my choice wether i intercept messages or not|`|VZVGXRyraa	I don't think it's outrageous at all. So they answered your text, that's all you know. You don't what else they're doing...they had the decency to let you know that your friend wouldn't be texting you. You don't know if they're going through her phone...all you know for sure is that they read 1 message, yours.<br>  <br>  Is your friend hiding something? I'm 20 now but i know when i lived with my parents, i let them see my texts whenever they asked...hell, they sometimes just wanted to talk to my friends when i was texting them so i handed the phone over. I had nothing to hide from so i didn't really care.<br>  <br>  You're overreacting to something that has absolutely nothing to do with you.

VpcT7dUgaa	I would "go green" with my diet and my environment.<br>  Carefully research everything you're exposed to so you can eliminate all sources of toxins from your environment.<br>  Don't worry about things you can't control, like air pollution.<br>  However, be diligent in searching for truly safe cleaning products, personal care products and food.<br>  Here's some of what we have done over the last 3 years:<br>  <br>  We eliminated all artificial sweetners.<br>  We eliminated all "anti-bacterial" soaps and cleaners from our home.<br>  We replaced our mattress with an organic cotton and wool mattress. <br>  We got filters for our shower heads to eliminate chlorine.<br>  We started cleaning with vinegar and baking soda.<br>  We gave up anything and everything (it was hard!) with artificial fragrance. No fabric softener. No air fresheners. No perfume. No scented lotions (unless they're scented with essential oils). Fragrance is toxic. Toxins affect fertility and aren't good for babies should you have one.<br>  We use Charlie's Soap on all our laundry.<br>  We use Dr. Bronner's soap and lotion on our bodies. My husband uses their shaving cream.<br>  We use Ecover for dishes.<br>  We got rid of ALL our non-stick cookware. Yes, cooking eggs sucks but it's not worth getting cancer over.<br>  We only use Pre-seed for lubrication. I've gotten pregnant 3 times in the last 3 years using it (1 miscarriage).<br>  We gave up anti-perspirants for natural deodorant.<br>  All animal products that we eat at home are organic (meat, eggs, butter, cheese etc).<br>  We don't use sunscreen (it CAUSES cancer because it blocks the rays that cause burns {mother nature's way of telling you "ENOUGH!} but doesn't block the rays that cause cancer). If you must be in the sun long enough to burn, don't use toxic chemical sunscreens.<br>  Avoid soy - it's not good for your hormones.<br>  We take Carlson's fish oil every day (1 tsp per 50 pds. of body weight). You can never take in enough with capsules. Those omega 3's are more important than you can imagine.<br>  I gave up conventional nail polish for a water-based safe polish.<br>  We stopped using our microwave. <br>  We don't get flu shots - they have mercury in them and they're not effective.<br>  <br>  Don't put anything in or on your body without researching it first. Question every procedure or drug that's recommended. Doctors don't know nearly as much as they want you to believe they do. Subscribe to newsletters from Mercola.com and NaturalNews.com. Even if you just skim the topics of each newsletter you'll learn a lot. Then really read articles that pertain to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fG727pkuaa	I have been ttc for 5-6 months now.

He told you he was 17 because YOU WOULDN'T HAVE EVER SLEPT WITH HIM IF YOU KNEW HE WAS EIGHTEEN! Duh!!!! Either way, it's illegal if the age of consent is 16. (The age of consent is 16 in most states, and it's illegal for anyone over that age to sleep with anyone under that age.) I wouldn't call the cops on him though, because you agreed and although what he did was wrong, you shouldn't have been sleeping with him in the first place.|`|16bWGB14aa	It was illegal for him to sleep with you since he was 18 and your younger so you should call the cops on him.|`|AA10475412	Why did you sleep with him in the first place.

MHOxPs8Oaa	I'm putting my child in a private school.  They teach children so much better than public schools, they learn much more and a better pace, they get more one on one help. I love private schools so much more.  I'm not saying public schools are bad either, I just prefer private schools.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm curious as to how you think public school is child abuse, I kept trying to think of a reason how it could be, but I can't find any reasons.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Child abuse, huh.......some people have no choice for one and there are plenty of good public schools that offer a range of curriculum plus the added benefit of varied ethnicities and socio economic backgrounds.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Public school is child abuse now? Good heavens. You can't spank your kids anymore, you can't yell at your kids anymore, and now you can't send them to public school anymore. What is this world coming to?|`|rFtKFp03aa	We live in Las Vegas, I am planning on enrolling my triplets in private school... <br>  <br>  If anything I am only hoping it will be safer...|`|5q7uPqVmaa	I've attended both public and private schools and honestly for my own child I suspect that I will choose public schools.  She's in kindergarten right now at a private Montessori preschool because our local public school only has half day kindergaretn and I wanted her to have a full day program since I work.<br>  And I work as a...you guessed it!  A public school teacher.  It's hard not to take personally the statement that sending your children to public school is tantamount to child abuse.  I work very hard to be a good teacher; I have spent time and money to educate myself about the latest teaching practices and spend a lot of time making sure that the students in my class receive the best education possible.  I would say that I probably have to be a better teacher than those at private schools, whose parents are often college educated and whose childrne have often attended excellent preschools and come to school with full stomachs and ready to learn.  The students that I teach have often overcome greater odds than you or your children will (hopefully) ever have to encounter: many of them grew up speaking languages other than English and have to learn to speak, write, and learn in English; some of them have witnessed horrible things that I feel horrible even hearing about; many come to school hungry or cold or suffering the effects of poverty, and all of them work very hard to overcome these challenges and to learn.  I had one student last year who grew up initially in another country, moved to the US after witnessing the shooting death of her mother and younger brother, and is now thriving in our school in the gifted program and on the honor roll!<br>  The thing is public schools and private schools have their own strengths and weaknesses.  I have a hard time imagining any place where you'd want to dismiss the public schools out of hand as altogether horrible.  There are good public schools and bad ones; good private schools and bad private ones.  I attended both public and private schools (if I said the private school's name, you'd probably know it).  Here's the problem with the private school: the quality of the teachers was really really variable because guess what?  There's no licensing for them and no guarantee they were any good because they didn't have to have any training.  Would you let just anybody work on your car because they've always felt passionately about working on cars and thought they might be good at it but had no training?  You might but you'd be crazy to do it, so why do essentially the same for your child?  I had some really good teachers there but I had several horrible ones, including one that refused to actually teach in class even when I asked questions.  The other reality is that there are good and bad kids everywhere but in private schools there are fewer children overall so the chances are that your child will know the bad children much much better than they would at a public school where there are<br>  many more children.  How well do you want your child to know children who do and use drugs?  In private school, I'd estimate that 50 percent of the kids I knew used or dealt drugs.  In public school where I had a wider pool to choose from, I would say it was more like 5 percent.|`|yZDyUfSNaa	For preschool, private, as there are no other options out there where we live. <br>  <br>  For kindergarten and up, public. We live in an area with one of the nation's top public school systems, our high school is rated within the top 100 in the country, so I feel a private education would be pointless here. I have, however, lived in areas where the public school systems are also rated some of the lowest in the country, and if we still lived there I would probably enroll my kids in private school.<br>  <br>  That being said, most of the people who live in the US cannot afford private schools, so home schooling (if the family can afford someone to stay home) or public schooling are the only options. Why would giving your child an education, even if it isn't the most stellar available, be considered child abuse??|`|KPac9A2qaa	Enrolling a child in Public School is certainly not abuse, just not good (in my opinion) if they are not old enogh to stand up for themselves and what they believe. For my kids I will do Private School for as long as I can and if I think they are ready I will send them to public school (possibly 10-) They will definatley go to a Private College though :K|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Those are the only two choices?  Because my husband and I were really hoping to home school...<br>  <br>  What exactly about public school makes you say that?  Just curious...as I am an educator in the system and while I will be the first to admit that it isn't perfect...I certainly wouldn't go as far as calling it "child abuse."|`|FEhmNTL2aa	Doesn't matter which you choose, there's good and bad kids at both.

The public schools were trying to just pass her through from one grade to the next. I was the one doing the teaching, because they could not be bothered. Sadly there are a lot of public schools like ours. I decided to help out at the school, and that is when I really found out what was happening inside the 4 walls. The teachers spent more time correcting, yelling, and scolding kids than they do teaching. The teachers were glorified babysitters, and very little teaching went on. My child is now an Honor Roll student, and doing fantastic. Smaller classes, more individualized one on one teaching, (without the yelling etc.) makes a big difference. If you really want to find out what is going on in your childs school, make several surprise visits to the childs classes. It might be an eye opener for you...it was for me.|`|0HICV1Tmaa	My son goes to public school.The ones here are really good,and have hardly any trouble makers.That is while they're little,when he gets in high school though I might switch him.I've been there and I know what goes on.|`|im3vWyv6aa	I don't see how being in a public school is child abuse.<br>  <br>  We are a Christian family... however with 4 kids the cost of a private school is too much for us. Our children are doing great in their public school. They excel academically (straight A's) and they are top athletes. They also have tons of friends. We go to Church and we teach them their morals here at home.<br>  <br>  Public school is far from abuse.<br>  <br>  Best wishes...<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Public, I live in an area with extremely good schools. Almost no one here goes to private unless it's for religious reasons. I could either afford to pay for private schools or college for my son and I choose college. My husband's mom paid for private schools that were no better than public, maybe even worse, and then refused to help with college. In my opinion that's completely backwards.
HBgnkltfaa	Aurora and Lorelei are the two most obvious choices (the latter of those coming from the TV show Gilmore Girls).<br>  <br>  Any "ro" name should work, though:<br>  Rowena (ro-EEN-uh or ro-WEN-uh)<br>  Romina<br>  Rosalie<br>  Rosalind<br>  Rosemary (ROsemaRY -- the first and last two letters)<br>  <br>  Because R's and L's are linguistically very similar, you could also use:<br>  Lola<br>  Delores<br>  Laura<br>  Lauren<br>  Laurel<br>  Laurana (an obscure literary name)<br>  Alora (made up but pretty)<br>  Eliora<br>  Flora<br>  Gloria<br>  Hannelore (han-uh-LOR-uh)<br>  <br>  Of all those options, the ones I think might work best would be Rosalie, Rosemary, or Rowena, but they're all possibilities.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|2rOQyvaKaa	Aurora|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Lorelai<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmore_Girls" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmore_Gir...</a>|`|S3vYMNzFaa	Oh!

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Babies are able to monitor how many calories they get so if they are getting mostly foremilk they will eat more.  Overeating and overactive letdown can cause spitting up.<br>  <br>  If you are engorged in the mornings that's probably why he's spitting up.  Too much milk and too fast.|`|avx7bLnKaa	I disagree with the first poster... In the am... If the baby hasn't fed in a while there may be a bit more foremilk... There is a greater supply of milk in the am than in the pm... If you pump milk in the morning it is usually thinner than in the evening... Especially if your breast is engorged in the morning.<br>  <br>  But I do agree with the first poster in that you should not switch breasts during one feeding... Stick with only one breast for a feeding so baby gets a good balance of foremilk and hindmilk<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|qtCVLDFxaa	Nature is well made ! If baby gets too much foremilk (like in a case of oversupply), he *will* throw it all up then want to nurse again to get at the hindmilk.<br>  <br>  However this has nothing to do with time of day. Everytime you nurse one breast to the end, your body goes through the cycle of fore-mixed-hind milk. That's why it's important not to switch breasts until the first one is fully empty (baby pulls away or falls asleep). Even if baby drank well AM, he will still start off the feed with foremilk in the PM !<br>  <br>  EDIT: It is possible that he gets more fore-milk if you are more engorged in the morning (like oversupply). But he would throw it up imediately after a feed and want more. Probably he is just more active during the day, and his oesophagus muscle is bit loose. Even being excited can cause spitting up in sensitive babies !|`|3c389272b0d2a9360ace888cf3f5ecd5aa	The foremilk is the milk that comes out when he first starts sucking. Meaning the first few minutes, then the hindmilk comes in after that. You don't get foremilk in the morning and hindmilk in the afternoon. Not possible unless you are giving him pumped milk in a bottle. The reason he could be spitting up more in the morning is, he is not fully awake and not swallowing everything or he is getting too much air.|`|deIzFnV8aa	My DD often spits up in the morning, too. I think it is unrelated to foremilk/hindmilk, though that is an interesting idea. Your milk is actually more fatty in the morning, but there is also more of it, so it takes baby longer to get to the hindmilk. So yes, they might eating more foremilk in the morning (though they are also more hungry so might get to the hindmilk anyway).<br>  <br>  However, my theory is that morning is basically the only time DD eats on an empty stomach. During the day, I am feeding her every 3 1/2 hours usually, and certainly always before she is hungry enough to cry for food. So I don't think her little tummy is actually ever totally empty. HOwever, she goes much longer between her night feeding and the morning one. Plus, usually I am carrying her around or sitting her up, and I think the combo of that is what does it.....<br>  <br>  Just some thoughts, other than the fatty-morning-milk part, there is no actual knowledge in this post, lol!|`|KDb96QS7aa	It doesn't make sense to me as to why a baby would spit up simply because the milk they are consuming has a lower fat content.  Especially since the issue with foremilk/hindmilk imbalance is that foremilk moves through the gut too FAST thus causing the gassiness and intestinal irritation seen in that condition.   <br>  <br>  I would tend to agree with Mystic here.  You probably are more engorged in the morning and milk may come out faster.  Baby also may be a little hungrier and so s/he eats quickly and swallows more air while eating - causing more spit up.

Hoe7sJM4aa	I really like the name as it is! Luna Belle. I think if you added something else it would just be too long and sound too odd. Try thinking of a last name or add some middle names, so the person doesn't always have to be called by a really long name but you can still use a longer name if you want. So like, Luna Belle Myst Simpkins, but the character goes by Luna Belle (or just Luna or just Belle) when close friends and/or family refer to the character, but can still be called by a longer name or a combination (ex. Luna Belle Simpkins or Luna Simpkins)|`|WCvciOQCaa	I agree with the others. Adding a third name will make things complicated. You can always add something to Bell to make it more complete.  But then you might have to switch Luna around. For example, Bellatrix. Luna Bellatrix doesn't really go.|`|nJfyv2otaa	I think it's ok but Aluna Belle works better<br>  or Luna Joy Belle|`|DPdAe5fAaa	I think Luna Belle sounds perfect, when I am reading I don't like when people have long or weird names because I always end up stopping trying to figure out how to say it!|`|GBA66N7iaa	i think it need another syllable on one of the names like lunita belle or luna bellta|`|i3FgiLENaa	Im not lovin it..<br>  Luna means moon.<br>  Star and myst??? thats stupid.<br>  i hope she's a wierd character|`|7drjpohUaa	I like it, but it does look like it's missing something. But Luna Belle Star or Luna Belle Myst is a bit much. Luna Star and Luna Myst are okay, but otherwise it's too much. Maybe give her a normal-ish last name to contradict the oddness??|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	Do, I think Luna Belle is fine.

DQ2eTxaSaa	Luna Belle because if they both end in a (lunA bellA), it sounds kind of weird. Luna Belle is much more elegant sounding.|`|DCJAMtkHaa	Luna Belle.<br>  <br>  Unless it's a story for really young kids I think Luna Belle is the way to go.  Luna Bella is a bit too rhymey with the matching endings.|`|RPuZgfyZaa	Luna Belle|`|w1NsamA5aa	luna belle|`|W2rZ44Keaa	I like Luna Bella. It flows better. With Luna Belle, if I read that in a story every page, I would keep looking at it again to take a second try at the name. Like some names it stories you can't pronounce and always second look at them to make sure you have it right through out the whole story that is what it would do to me. So Luna Bella in my opinion flows much better.|`|SIGVH6dOaa	Luna Belle flows better then Luna Bella|`|GSqn7Cu0aa	Luna Belle  must be a cool story|`|WIyOztjvaa	Luna Belle. it just sounds so much better, smoother, prettier|`|2hIQb8f1aa	Luna Belle, just sounds better to me than lunahhh bellahhhh. you know?|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	Luna Belle.

7U90RM46aa	Well Mommy now is the time to get mean. When I say that use a different tone of voice when you tell her not to hit. Use a rough Mommy tone when you tell her not to hit. Get nose to nose with her. Then turn her from you and carry her to her room or to time out. Explain one the way to time out that this is time out and the reason and that her toys will go away for one hour and that tv will not happen that day. No tv and take her toys away for one whole hour. Now that might drive you alittle crazy but you can find something else to do with her in that time. I suggest having her draw out what happened and what happens when we hit. When she gets out of time out (a minute and a half) You need to talk to her. Use the word Frustrated and ask her if she was? Then explain a better method of how to deal with frustration. Also if you can catch her just before a melt down or hitting session then you need to! When she starts to get frustrated you need to get on her level ask her to breath and then ask her if she is frustrated. Then you need to talk to her about why. Ask open questions and try to understand what she is telling you. Be firm, but also be loving. It will be just fine if you stand your ground and keep the communication going she will learn.|`|mTQutqyAaa	my nephew is like that and probably worse. his doc said that it is pretty normal and that once he learns to communicate better he should settle down some. when he is mad he bites, pushes, punches kicks, and bangs his head. last night i put him on time out and he threw himself off of the couch resulting in a huge bump. his mom and i were a bit freaked out by the size of it so we kept an eye on him. then a few minutes later his mom took something away that he is not allowed to play with and he started banging his head on everything where he already had the bump. he was totally freaking me out. i thought he might freakin kill himself. so he is about to start working with a speech therapist. hopefully she lives through it! my daughter has been working with a speech therapist for about a year and it's amazing how quickly she began to understand things and express herself.|`|sAhAEC2qaa	spank her|`|PrxlHUT5aa	first of all make sure she's not overstimulated, tired or hungry... no toddler (or adult! lol) will listen to reason when he's on this state. she should get enough rest...if you see her yawning, scratching her eyes and starts to get tired tell her that in 5 or 10 mins, she'll need to snuggle with you, or lie down to read a book... that way she'll get downtime or better yet take a nap preventing a meltdown instead of you reacting to one :o) as to communicating her frustration verbally, acknowledge her feelings first and tell her exactly what to do and say, and keep practicing/reminding her that especially on times she isn't actually mad... it's tough to see straight when you are mad already -- human nature.  tell her, you are a good girl and so your hands aren't supposed to hit but it's ok to get mad...take her away from the triggers of her frustration... time outs by the way is not to punish children but to let them calm down, don't call the child bad or naughty when you send them there... it's best to have adult supervision when she processes her thought and feelings while in the time out corner or thinking chair (never call it a naughty chair! it will emphasize that she is bad...kids aren't bad, it's the behavior and we can mold those behavior) ...making her apologize when she doesn't mean it isn't good either -- kids should learn to regroup their feelings, calm down, learn to empathize first before their apology will come with sincerity.  I remind my eldest daughter that when we apologize we have to mean it and that we will try our best not to do it again -- saying sorry just for the sake of saying it is counterproductive... I sometimes hear kids demand to other kids, apologize to me now!! I find it meaningless and undoubtedly they have learnt this thru adult imitation -- it's not a pretty sight.  I never actually believed in terrible twos, early terrible ones and extended terrible threes, I just believed they will act terribly no matter when, what and where and it's up to us to shape their behavior and values through consistency, constant reminder, role modeling & genuine love tempered by discipline.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Ah, the terrible twos. You have to be very patient with her, and try to understand what exactly causes her outbursts, if there is a point where she can't help it, what might trigger the outburst.  Self-control must be learned, and it can take time. Be consistent with the time-outs and remember, she is old enough to understand consequences/punishment-taking her favorite toy away, or favorite video or planned outing. Consistency and patience, may they be with you.

x647LeB2aa	Baby Berry is 100% correct so go with that :)<br>  <br>  Mine is 11.5 months and has never had a jar of food so I'm not sure about the lumpiness of them.  Just give your baby whatever you are having mashed down with a fork.  As she gets older, mash it less.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	My son has been having lumpy foods from 6 months - the latest "advice" is that they can have lumps straight away (if soft) if they can manage them - pureeing foods stems back to when we used to wean at 4 months but a six month old baby should be able to handle them.<br>  <br>  I gave my son a few "tasters" of pureed foods when he was 5.5 months but he has been having more lumpy foods since he turned 6 months, he's almost 7 months now & also has finger foods which he manages really well.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about how to introduce it - I don't know about the lumps in jars, I haven't used a jarred food yet, but my son is able to push lumps that are too big out of his mouth. <br>  <br>  She'll let you know if uts too lumpy, thin, thick whatever, don't worry about it, just try a few things and go with the flow!<br>  <br>  as a way to start, try mashing with a fork instead of pureeing, this might give you an idea of what she can and can't handle. <br>  Good luck.|`|08GDBedGaa	My baby is 8 1/2 months old (6 months corrected age).............what does this mean....???<br>  <br>   just don't puree it, mash it up with the fork, mash it more the first few times and slowly, mash it up less, also introduce baby to finger foods, such as cooked peas/carrots/sweet potato blocks, all familiar foods in blocks!!
fPuZGkmsaa	There is no right or wrong answer. If you want your child to have the same last name as the father then go for it. It doesn't matter if the two of you are together now or not. I understand that you would be concerned but you only have 3 choices. His last name, your, or hyphenated. Since you seem to dislike your last name then I would go for the fathers. <br>  <br>  On another note, I really hope that the father comes around. Just know that even if he doesn't your child will always have you. It takes a lot of guts for you to go through this by yourself and to stand up for what you believe in. Good luck!!!!!|`|AA11138222	The way you typed this makes it a little hard to read...<br>  <br>  I guess I would suggest giving the baby your last name. I know you don't like it, but in the future, if the father decides not to be a part of the child's life it will just be easier if your child's last name matches yours.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Give the baby the dads last name, or consider changing your last name and give it to the baby when he/she is born. You do not need the dad or your last name to survive. A good way to start a new life.|`|igvUbqkyaa	Wow! That's tricky! I say take your mom's last name (for both you and your baby) and then you can have a last name of a person you were close to and your baby will share the same last name as you. And if you weren't close to your mom or you weren't raised by your mom, take the last name of the person you were raised by!!|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	I would give him your last or a hyphenated name. It will be easier for him to have the same last name of the person who will be taking care of him most of the time (YOU). Or you could give him your mom's maiden or last name or another family name as a last name.|`|7drjpohUaa	Well giving the baby the father's name would be a good choice.<br>  But it also seems like your are unhappy with your own last name. So maybe change your last name to something you like more, and make that your baby's last name?|`|DP48dIxhaa	My suggestion is that you change your last name 2 something you like...or your real dad or mom's last name. & you give the baby ur last name, not his. Your child shouldn't have the name of a personn who isn't going 2 b a parent 2 her.|`|Hoe7sJM4aa	Give the baby your last name. If the baby has the father's last name then you may get into more trouble when trying to ensure you have custody and the father could have more influence and power in terms of custody over your child. If you give the baby your last name then you will have a lot less problems with custody discrepancies and what not. So even if you hate your last name, if the baby has your last name it means you have sole custody and power over the affairs of your baby, it just helps emphasize the baby is yours.|`|dVSv6o0Caa	Use a Hipehne. Lets say for example, your last name is smith and your husban's last name is jones. The baby's last name can be _____ Smith-Jones|`|vuLLbSVfaa	I would see how the rest of the pregnancy goes. If he's willing and involved then go for it, but if he's not then keep your last name.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I agree with Tiffy Tiff. It sounds like no one deserves to be honored for his last name. Create something for you and your baby and it will be special between you.|`|AeARjAD5aa	That's a hard decision.. luckily you won't have to make a final decision tomarrow, you still have 5 months or so and you can see how the father acts and if he does come around soon.. I wouldn't give him a whole lot of a time though. With that being said, although you might not want to relate your last name to the baby's b/c of the situation, it might be the smarter idea in the end b/c say the father wants to be around and the baby is born and he decides to take off, atleast your last name is with the baby. <br>  I'm kinda in the same situation, and I've been debating still or trying to get opinions. Only difference is that the father doesn't know yet, and even when he does, idk if I still want the baby having his last name b/c I don't ever see me having it. Growing up with my parent's divorced and my mom remarried it always complicated things with the different last names. That's partially why I'm leaning toward my last name.<br>  Worse comes to worse, you could always hyphenate it...<br>  <br>  Good Luck though!|`|f0dnVAW7aa	You can decide which name you want to your baby to have. If he isn't going to be there for you then you get to decide everything. <br>  <br>  You are this baby's world. From the second it is conceived you are all it knows. It might wonder some day (while it's still really young and too hard to explain) why it's name is different than mommies.. or it might not even really think about it. <br>  <br>  I am so proud and grateful that you did not listen to him and get an abortion - on behalf of all the aborted souls I thank you.<br>  <br>  You have a while to think about it.. and as someone suggested - you could change your name too. Pick a really beautiful last name for yourself as well as your child. You deserve to be happy and comfortable with. This could be really fun for you. <br>  <br>  I know I hated having my fathers last name growing up. He wasn't a nice man and I always wanted to take my mom's name. But when I got married I was happy too - O'Connor.. it made my day. lol<br>  <br>  You could have fun choosing names for your baby and see which last name it flows better with. You might want to give it time too.. you never know what the future beholds. A friend of mine was 7 months pregnant, went to a starbucks and met her now husband. He just walked into her life and wanted to be apart of everything. The baby calls him daddy and has his last name. I'll admit it was a little strange at first - but I guess it just takes the right guy. You might find someone wonderful in these next 28 weeks that will walk in and change your life forever (for the better of course).<br>  <br>  Have you thought of names yet? That was my favourite part of being pregnant. Once my husband and I decided to start trying all I could do was write down names. <br>  <br>  The father might come around eventually. You are worth so much more than him so good for you for realizing that you don't want a relationship with him - but it is very mature of you to want to include the father in the childs life. I don't know if you have a way of contacting her, but you might be able to create a relationship with his daughters mother. This is going to be your baby's big sister and it might be nice to let them know each other. And if you can somehow get into his daughters life, and you say that he is close to her, he might just be forced to know your child. But you never know - he might just have gotten cold feet.. nervous about having another child with someone who he wasn't involved with. As you've said, he might just need his space.<br>  <br>  Message me any time, I'm always open to talk. <br>  <br>  Best Wishes!!
vuEyUbsgaa	oh wow I didn't even know about this stuff. Thats interesting.|`|NjeN7Lc9aa	hiya, im just like you Always worried,what can i say, babies are angels so im sure that god will look after them.good luck|`|eJ539ejpaa	You never will know for sure unless you grow ALL your own food and process it yourself.  I just try not to worry about what could happen and trust that I am doing the best for my kids.  There are no guarantees in life no matter how careful you are.  Some moms try to keep their children away from every germ and yet something completely different may harm them.|`|0NRAdYTsaa	Try homemade baby food. Whatever food you eat, not seasoned, not buttered, not salted, not greasy, in a food processor. Of course, you're going to cook it and kill the germs/bacteria that way. Just blend it after you cook it. It can store in the freezer for up to 3 months. I had this issue when I was feeding my little brother about 11-12 years ago. They were finding metal and glass inside the baby food jars. So, yes, this fear is very real to me. I make my own for my children, watch everything they eat, and cook it thoroughly.  <br>  <br>  Just be sure you watch what you put in it. As far as juice goes, get a juicer and make your own.

The only way is if it's an illegal abortion(not a real doctor preforming it), but in those cases the mother has a good chance of dying.|`|4CDVFjPEaa	Not all states require women under 18 to get a parent(s) permission before having an abortion.  Some only require notification of the parents and a few have no requirement for parental involvement at all. <br>  <br>  Where it exists the requirement for parental consent or notification is not absolute.  If a woman cannot notify a parent or is afraid to or she feels she is mature enough to make her own decision she can petition a judge for permission to bypass the parental notification or consent requirements.  <br>  <br>  And in a few states the physician who will perform the abortion can waive the notification or consent requirements if certain criteria are present.|`|v5SXqxo0aa	It depends on your state.<br>  <br>  An Incomplete List (complete list here: <a href="http://parentingteens.about.com/od/teenpregfact/a/abortion_laws.htm" rel="nofollow">http://parentingteens.about.com/od/teenp...</a> ):<br>  <br>  In Alaska, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon,  and more there is are no abortion rules for teens.

OI3bf4yjaa	Ugh, I was so constipated when I was pregnant. It's mostly because the pregnancy hormone progesterone slows down the intestinal function. Are you eating 10 to 15 grams per day of dietary fiber? Try exercising lightly. Add prunes or prune juice to your diet. These natural laxatives can easily be added to a daily diet. Stay away from mineral oil and castor oils as laxatives.|`|plI0WOrUaa	Ya it happens from time to time.  I went to my pharmacist and found a laxative that is perfectly safe during pregnancy.  It doesn't ever cause cramping or all day trips to the bathroom.  It is really gentle and works overnight so that you aren't worried about having to go while you are out!  Good luck and try something like that because it sounds like you are doing everything else you can!!|`|PV9YFZNmaa	talk with your doctor first but there is all Natural stool softeners that might work such as unsweetened prune try that i know it works for the elderly i work with.|`|DoaMYpfMaa	try drinking prune juice it tastes nasty but it works|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Ha ha.  TWo kiwifruit a day.  Also: eat 50% veges, no matter what.  A large salad a day with nice vinaigrette on it (vinegar's really good for you and the oil in it is good as well).  <br>  <br>  That or a caster oil chaser:  1/2 c caster oil, float orange or lemon juice on top and chase with slices of lemon, to cut the oil off your tongue.<br>  <br>  but otherwise, you have to stick a finger up there and find the blockage.  oooh dear.  Sorry: but digital investigation better done by you than the doctor,  gaaah.  Having said this, I have been told to 'lie down & face the wall"  as had perinaeal tears on teh wrong side of teh wall (ie tore during childbirth inside the bum & nobody noticed) and the terror of going to the toilet just got worse, and worse, and worse. <br>  <br>  Doctor gave me pessaries which really, really fixed me up within a couple of days.  If you can't see what the blockage is go to the doctor.  George Sands died of a bowel blockage and apparrently they could hear her screams from the next street.|`|ynjgq4GZaa	Yeah, prune juice is really effective.  In fact, so much you may want to be sure you're near a toilet for the next couple days lol.  It really does taste terrible, so I always took it in a shot glass (or 2 shots if i was feeling really bad).  My mom also said if you absolutely can't stand prune juice, try dried prunes instead, because they taste better and still work.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	Cheerios!! or sunflower seeds!
BlPJw4iAaa	Be care full what material you use. Im not sure if wool is a good one as it harbours bacteria. They don't tend to use blankets in the incubators as they already can control the Temperaturee of the air inside. Older babies may use the blankets though, I would think it would be best to contact your local baby unipaediatricic unit and ask what is best. After all you don't want all your hard work to go to waste. Im sure they'll be chuffed with your efforts. Keep up the good work!|`|6L9jJnchaa	That's really sweet...I wish I knew how to crochet...I want to make my son's blanket myself, but I have to learn how.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	Maybe make them the same size as a receiving blanket? It will be good for swaddling and holding the baby and will fit into a Moses basket without being too big or bulky. You also can make more with less yarn too :)|`|tQVBDx5Paa	I'd make it a standard size baby blanket....about 40" x 40".  It is actually nice to be able to fold the blanket so if the baby needs to be warmer it can be doubled, even tripled.  My daughter was in the NICU and she had a white crocheted blankie in her crib basket....they had it folded several times as she had a hard time keeping warm.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	I think your wonderful for doing this for the babies!  Moses size would  probably be best:)|`|EJrM8gr9aa	How sweet of you to do this!! my since was in NICU for a month because he was 2 months early and we still have his blanket from there a year later. And while most of the babies are premature, i noticed in my sons nursery that there was a good amount of bigger babies suffering from breathing problems, upper respiratory infections and there was one there that was 7 months old and been there since birth. if i were you i would try do a size that could accommodate preemies and newborns sizes.|`|Rrrlf7jWaa	Id say make some as small as an A4 sheet of paper. My daughter was in NICU for 6 weeks, and weighed only 2lb 5oz. We still have her blanket and its about that size. Can I just say what a thoughtful person you are, there are so many prem babies nowadays, and you don't realise till you go into NICU just how small they are ( the boy next to us was only 600g)<br>  <br>  ps : My daughter had hers in her incubater, and it is made of wool, so wool is fine.|`|DPdAe5fAaa	I would make them about the size of a receiving blanket.<br>  That is so sweet of you to do that!
RfiWW07zaa	pull him aside the next time he starts being irrational, kneel down to his eye-level, and calmly but assertively say, "NAME, you need to stop right now. Crying is not going to solve anything. If you do not stop, I can't help you. You can sit down right here (sit him in a chair), and finish being upset, and when you are ready to talk about it, you can come over and talk to me." then just walk away, begin doing something else, and don't even look at him or acknowlege him till he calms down and comes to you. it works like a charm at the daycare i work at!|`|TAa8VKlJaa	there might be somehing seriously wrong with him....|`|ncjQYJ7iaa	Ask him\her if they need something or give him something|`|UFhrD7DWaa	threatin him|`|NDoyhCZYaa	Hit him.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	tickle him|`|YgGi07Rpaa	Beat him, Club him, Hit Him, Sack him, drown him in a lake, no one will ever know it was you...<br>  <br>  JKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJK don't do that lol just bribe him with Candy and say "If you don't SHUT UP I'm telling mom and dad!" that is what always works for me and I have TWIN nine year old brothers that are the EXACT same way and sometimes i want to do what i told you to do.|`|O01oFg3Eaa	That brat needs a good kick in the pants.

427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Babies don't wean themselves this early.  It's just because he's sick.  <br>  <br>  Is his nose stuffy so that he has a hard time breathing while nursing?  If so, you can turn the shower on and take him into the steam-filled bathroom to help clear out his nose before nursing.  You could also try dripping some expressed milk up his nose to help clear it out or even in his ears if you think he might have an earache.<br>  <br>  It's important to keep trying to offer the breast as much as possible and minimize bottles in order to maintain your supply.<br>  <br>  Here's some more info on nursing a sick baby...<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/illness/baby-illness.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/illness/b...</a><br>  <br>  Hope he's feeling better soon!  The best thing for him right now is your milk.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Milk from a bottle is easier for him to get, he has to work a little harder getting it from the breast.  I don't think at this age they can really wean themselves.  You definitely need to try to get him to nurse, your milk supply will start to dry up if you're only pumping, pumping doesn't empty your breast all the way.  Maybe when he starts feeling a little better don't give him the option of the bottle, he will eventually nurse when he gets hungry enough:)  Good luck!|`|I4a8zI1gaa	aww... i'm so sorry he has a bad cold.  that's the worst when they can't breathe!!  Don't worry about your supply going down.. if you keep pumping, it'll keep producing.  You have to keep trying to offer him bottles, pedialyte, bm, ANYTHING at this point to keep him hydrated.  Dylan had this same problem and I told the doctor that im worried bc he wont drink or eat hardly anything.  And she said as long as he still has wet diapers, he's fine and that babies actually drink a lot more than they need. <br>  <br>  What you have to focus on now is getting your little guy back to feelig okay.  It takes time and colds are the worst.  They dont want ot eat because everything hurts and they cant breathe!! HOw can they breathe if they have something in their mouth?  And they cant taste anything.. too much work for them :) <br>  <br>  Keep sucking out his nose.  Close one nostril while youre sucking out the other (A LOT more comes out) ... use johnson n johnsons vapor bath for babies with colds.  Use a vaporizer in his room.  Keep him elevated when he sleeps.  If it's cool out, try to take him out for just a moment, it's known to clear up the sinuses.  And can you give him benadryl yet?  That helps a lot too.  And tylenol.  Talk to his ped.  He may be developing an ear infection as well. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you though... just keep him hydrated and give him lots of TLC and you'll be okay :)|`|a7pgX1W8aa	Its is probably just from him being sick and he can't breathe that well when his is on the breast. Try aspirating his nose before you breast feed him. I  breastfed my son and when he got sick he did the same thing and I aspirated his nose before I fed him every-time he sounded like he needed it and he breastfed then. Maybe this could help you. Hope this helps.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	He can't breathe.<br>  <br>  Hold him in a steamy bathroom for a little while, use saline drops, put Vaporub on his feet, and put a pillow UNDER his mattress to raise his head a little or let him sleep in his car seat so his sinuses will drain.  Blow his nose.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FrH8Dhryaa	Deff cause baby is sick. When my little one had a cold i would steam the bathroom, sit in there with him and try to bf, try proping baby up as much as possible while bf so mucus will flow down an hoprfully it could breathe a little better (it worked for me) don't worry it'll be over hopefully sooner than later and then you  can resume normal feeding.<br>  <br>  Hope baby gets well soon, best of luck.|`|WWQ5dChcaa	give him time he will eat again|`|X6as2nOAaa	It is probably just him being sick, when my baby was sick she really didn't want to eat and it took a little bit to get her eating like she did before.
4cehW3S9aa	Many places don't do more than one scan.  It depends on the doctor.  You could request one but then insurance doesn't cover it.  I definitely wouldn't lie to the doctor like some said because then they may do some unnecessary tests.  If you are on gov't assistance (not sure if you are), I heard that they will only do a 20 week because they don't want to pay for it.<br>  <br>  I had one at 8w 6d and one at 12w 6d.  I guess it just varies on locations.|`|3Ncriah6aa	your lucky youve gotten one already. i am 14 wks pregnant, have only been to my doctor twice and dont get my first scan until im 22 wks pregnant. my doctor lets me hear my babys heartbeat each time though. maybe you could ask for that?!?! good luck to you though. you and your baby are fine darlin dont stress. just take care of yourself|`|uQc4UA2Caa	ask for the RUITINE scan at 12 weeks to check the length of the babies nuchal fold.<br>  u should be having 4 scans and the 20 week one is supposed to be the 4th!!!!! u could tell them your having really bad pain and want to check if its ok..i dont know. u must not be in australia coz they wouldnt be like that here...|`|98WKYtfwaa	Where i'm from you only get 2 routine scans, a dating one and an anomaly one.

The baby is being fed so who cares?  Another mother formula feeding her baby doesn't take away in the least from the fact that I'm breastfeeding my son.  <br>  <br>  #2 I formula fed my twins.  They're 20 months old and they are in perfect health!  They are so smart, happy, bonded to mommy and daddy, and they're just awesome!  I can't go on enough about my twins who got formula!<br>  <br>  So there you have it.  To me it doesn't matter either way whether you breastfeed or formula feed.  I'm so proud to be breastfeeding my son and happy that I stuck with the hard times but I would never ever in a million years judge a mother who made a different choice.  Anyone who judges something like that REALLY needs to get a life.  There are babies who are neglected and abused every day.  There are babies who are starving because their mothers don't have clean water or adequate food.  Shed tears and wring your hands over THOSE babies... not the ones who are being *fed* by their parents!|`|AjFzi1mbaa	well not neccessary. i breastfed because i wanted to and i didn't trust formula because all the recalls that was goin on, but if you feel that you are unable to breastfeed so you take better care mentally of your newborn, then do whats best. After 6 weeks of breastfeeding, i switched to formula. You shouldn't get thumbs down for doing what is best, not everyone is a perfect mother.|`|sAhAEC2qaa	i formula feed voluntarily too. my baby was takin 40-45 min on each side so at 7 weeks i stopped|`|1795e9adbd644bbbce946795cd052957aa	What upsets me, is not that mothers choose to formula feed.  It's when moms who WANTed or INTENDed to breastfeed given unsupportive or false information that trashes their success.  The reason this irkes me so much?  I was fortunate to have people who encouraged me to breastfeed and told me to throw out the formula and avoid it at all costs.  I did, and I was successful BECAUSE of that and I am glas I was because I went on to successfully breastfeed another baby.  I'm pretty sure if I was uncuccessful with my son, I never would have breastfed my daughter.|`|2IRXUpg6aa	There is no doubt breastfeeding is tough...it takes a lot of commitment patience and in my case extreme discomfort etc. I would never judge someone who is naive or has legitimate reasons for not doing it. Its the people who simply think breastfeeding is too inconvenient, messy and give up too soon (it can take some time to get it going) that bother me. You do have to make some sacrifices to give your children the best (if you can). This means some sleep deprivation, sore nipples and sometimes long or constant feeds. I really think mothers should be better educated....this could help a lot.|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	I could care less how a mother chooses to feed their baby. But I do think mothers who choose formula because they think breastfeeding is gross or because it takes up to much time or because formula is easier are very selfish and probably never give a second thought of how it may effect their babies. They usually just think of themselves. Nobody can tell me that's it's not selfish to formula feed because their baby nursed for to long. This may not be their fault. Many doctors and other sources push formula. If your baby isn't gaining weight according to the "charts" many doctors will suggest formula instead. Also in the US you hear so much about how breastfeeding is obscene.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	It just bums me out for the baby when new moms don't take the time to inform themselves. They formula feed for selfish reasons or thinking it's more convenient. <br>  <br>  I think formula is a fantastic invention and has helped a ton of mommies over the years. I myself breastfeed but am not ashamed at all to supplement when necessary. <br>  <br>  I say do what works best for the baby, and if that mean the baby gets formula fed so mommy can take care of her mental state, have at it.<br>  <br>  Some moms like to think they're better if they breastfeed, I say they're just b******!|`|SYRqxCMDaa	that's people for you.<br>  <br>  rude answers and judgment is why this question along with abortion and religion can NOT be discussed. it turns into a yelling fest. even if your YELLING WITH A COMPUTER KEYBOARD.<br>  <br>  to them there is no way to justify why you would refuse to provide your child with the best nutrition possible. <br>  <br>  which in turn, makes you a horrible mother in their eyes.<br>  <br>  but it all comes with the territory. when we choose to do certain things for whatever reason, there will always be criticism. especially when it comes to children.<br>  <br>  Im over it. i don't even care what people think. they can p!ss off.|`|Xhgq35dNaa	I have done both.  I breast fed AND formula fed.  Personally I think any woman that sits there and judges another woman because she formula feeds needs to tend to her own knitting.  One could argue that any woman who used disposable diapers is a bad mommy too (even if she is breast feeding and uses disposables for convenience).  There have been numerous studies regarding disposable diapers that say the use of them can lead to future infertility especially if used on females.  Plus they are horrible for our environment.  So is that to say that those Mommy's should use cloth or they are using bad judgment?  Come on people.  Mommy-hood is difficult in and of itself without ignorant know-it-alls shoving guilt down other women's throats.  What is good for you and your children is fine...it may not work for everyone else.|`|eJ539ejpaa	I personlaly think it is a personal choice.  There are mothers who breastfeed and not the best moms and vica-versa.  Of the 9 grandchilren on my side, 4 have had breast milk and the rest were formula fed.  I breast fed both my boys until three months and after that it just didn't work out.  My oldest has been healthier and my youngest has had tubes.  There is a special bond during breast feeding that I never got even when I used a bottle (breast milk or formula).  I also liked breastfeeding at night, because I didn't have a bottle to hold so I could doze off.  I believe that breast feeding has its benefits, but again that is my belief.  As a teacher, I  honestly cannot tell you who was breast fed or had formula, who wore Pampers or had clothe diapers.  What I can tell is if a child is loved and cherished at home or if the parent has his/her priorities mixed up.  And you are right, you shouldn't have to make up excuses.  As parents we will always face the dilema of are we doing the right thing for our children.  No matter what you do, someone will disagree and you will feel the need to justify.  Sometimes its just not worth it.  I plan to breast fee my 3rd child, but there are no guarantees it will work as planned.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	OK LADIES!! That's enough of attacking this lady. All she did was ask a question. NO NEED TO BE NASTY.. geez. <br>  <br>  Now to answer your question. I opted to formula feed my son because I was on anti-depressants, and it ends up in the breast milk. I found out I have celiac disease, when my son was 16 months old.  I know now that my breast milk would NOT have been nutritionally complete  for my son because I had a HUGE nutritional deficiency. Celiac disease can cause anxiety and depression. (www.celiac.org)<br>  <br>  However, with the research that I've done, breast milk is more nutritionally complete. But you did the right thing for your little one. You have to be emotionally and psychologically prepared to care for your newborn. Please don't let these ladies who are being mean and nasty bother you. You do what is best for you and your baby.. Remember.. Happy Mother=Happy Baby!! <br>  <br>  good luck. :)|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I think this applies to many issues on this site. Unless someone asks what the general opinion is on breastfeeding, formula feeding, using the cry it out method, using disposable or cloth nappies, using dummies, weaning onto solids before 6 months, etc etc, it is not our place to say what way someone should do it. And yes, I am guilty of it myself - I once called someone cruel for letting their baby cry to sleep but let's face it, it's not my business and that's the way it works for some people. <br>  There's no one particular issue that will make you a 'perfect mother', and breastfeeding is one that applies. My own mother breastfed - but she smoked and drank all through pregnancy, breastfeeding, co-sleeping, etc etc, and now me and my siblings have several health issues including IBS, asthma, chronic depression and more. Was she a perfect mother? Hell no! There really isn't any such thing as the perfect mother, it's a myth. If they (or we, whatever way you look at it) were that perfect, we'd be too busy hand knitting all our baby's clothes with organic cotton, or growing our own fruit and veg to home make all baby's food, to come on here and preach to other people how to be a perfect mother. Some would argue that the full time working mother who expresses her milk is the best mother - some would argue that she shouldn't be working at all. We'll never please everyone.<br>  And I say all this as a mother of a breastfed baby and a formula fed child.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I formula feed, so I appreciate this question.  However this will not stop the debate....nothing will.   Embrace the thumbs down...lol As long as no one is sitting in your house bashing you for formula feeding, I wouldn't worry.  <br>  This is just the internet where a bunch of strangers come to share, bash, vent and/or troll.  We all (or most all) share one thing in common...we are parents who love our children and that should be all that ever matters.  Parenting comes in different styles, just like clothing comes in different sizes and colors, and what suits you might not suit the person across the room.  Everyone should try to remember that.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	I couldn't of put it better myself! I formula fed because I was naive and didn't know enough about breastfeeding, I was young and scared about being a mum! <br>  <br>  I dont see the problem, what has it got to do with anyone else how you choose to feed YOUR child?! <br>  <br>  I usually avoid q's on here about breastfeeding/formula feeding, but I, like you, would like to know why it bothers people so much!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	LOL, when I first starred this question I thought:<br>  <br>  "Somehow I bet this isn't actually going to *end* the debate at all..."<br>  <br>  ;)|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Never *once* have I been approached by another mother and scolded for formula feeding. *Never*<br>  <br>  One of my best friends exclusively breast feeds her baby. She is a very holistic personal. I am not. Never *once* has she lectured me about the benefits of breast verses formula. *Never*<br>  <br>  I really think this breast vs formula debate is not as wide spread as one that frequents this site may think. I think there is a lot of people that hide behind their computers forcing their opinions on someone else. Majority of these people wouldn't dare pull half of this crap in person because they *know* it is considered socially unacceptable to judge people they way they do online.<br>  <br>  This goes both ways. It isn't one group in particular.<br>  <br>  Hiding behind a computer screen really helps you grow a set of kahunas and say and do things you otherwise wouldn't.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I in no way try to put down formula feeding mommies, but I will always advocate breastfeeding. I had to relactate after feeding my daughter formula for three weeks, I couldn't take the guilt of not breastfeeding her. I worked my butt off to breastfeed. Medications, pumping, breastfeeding on average 20 hours during the day, having my daughters weight checked, weekly doctor visits....the list goes on and on. I can't help but to be very proud of the accomplishment that we've achieved. So, I might get inwardly upset when I hear about someone just giving up on it because I worked so hard...but I would never want to be mean to someone just becasue they weren't breastfeeding.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I breastfeed, but don't have a problem with formula feeding. I don't care how a baby is fed as long as they get fed. In your situation, I think you did the best thing for your circumstances. I mean, i'd rather be in a good mental state and formula feed, than breastfeed and not be mentally stable.... if that makes sense?<br>  Don't let people's closed minds make you feel like you're a lesser mother than them. No one is a perfect mother, formula feeding or not. You just do the best damn job you can in raising your child the way you see fit.<br>  One of my friends told me this saying once:<br>  "If only closed minds had closed mouths". I can't help but agree :)|`|n3PE2lvDaa	it dosnt bother me that women use formula. But as for the postnatal depression thing. I had postnatal depression and my doctor put me on meds that were safe to use while breastfeeding. The doc decided it was still more beneficial to breastfeed and it helps decrease the postnatal depression due to the endorphin release that breastfeeding can create.|`|AA11476951	I believe in breastfeeding but if you don't want to I don't care. It's your baby not mine. As long as the baby is healthy and being raised by a good parent, formula feeding is pretty irrelevant.|`|14JQ11AUaa	I totally agree with you! I breastfed for 4 months. I pumped so I that feeding during the night time would be easier! By 4 months my son DID NOT want anything to do with my breast. He wanted a bottle, after a while my milk slowed WAY down and had no choice but to go to formula. My son loves formula, he got what he needed from my breast milk. I am happy I made it as far as I did and hope that my next child will nurse longer. I am with you on this, I do not understand these woman. If there is a question that has to do with formula ATTENTION BREAST FEEDERS: Do not answer it ok! If there is a question about breastfeeding ATTENTION FORMULA FEEDERS: Do not answer! Ahh, glad to get that off my chest lol. I am for both formula and breast milk...breast milk is best, but not the only route.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	I think that being a first time mum with a newborn is a huge huge change for anyone, and if you felt safer formula feeding then that is your decision and nobody else's business.  I understand how a lot of people feel so intimidated by the whole thing that just managing to get through the experience with sanity intact is a big deal. <br>  <br>  There is so much judgement and criticism that us women give each other, it is so sad, why can't we all just support each other a bit?<br>  <br>  (And btw before I get all the thumbs-down, I DID breastfeed my babies, but I just try not to judge anyone who chooses not to!)|`|4YIUxSlYaa	This doesn't at all end the formula vs breastfeeding debate.  You're just putting more fuel in the fire.<br>  <br>  If you don't need an excuse "and why do you need an EXCUSE to formula feed" then why did you give your excuse "If I said that i formula feed by choice - and my choice being that i have done it because i was unprepared to be a mommy and had so much anxiety about it... in addition to postpartum depression.. I formula fed so i could take medication to help me provide my son with the best care. And so that my husband could help - who also thought in our situation formula feeding would be best."<br>  <br>  I breastfed my daughter for a while and stopped for a reason that is no ones business but mine.  I intend to breastfeed my next child for a helluva lot longer.<br>  <br>  We all know breast is best, some just chose not to try.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't care if you breastfeed or formula feed.  Your child, your choice.  <br>  <br>  End of.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I have absolutely no problem with mommies who formula feed. That's your choice. I choose to breastfeed, because it works for my family. I do have issues with formula, but none are the fault of the parents who use it. Formula was a great inventions for mothers who needed it, well after a while formula companies pushed their product and it became the normal thing to do, i don't think it should have become the normal thing to do, but i don't blame the parents, i blame the companies who have pushed their product on American society.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I breastfed as long as I could and then I dried up, I don't get upset about people who formula feed because I have to, what bothers me is the people that are not willing to try to do it or say well my husband would like to help with the feedings so we choose not too, that to me is a pretty weak excuse the husband will have opportunity after opportunity to help with everything else and eventually the feedings sometime.  I don't give people thumb's down for saying things like that.|`|rjVALevtaa	I've done both breastfeeding and formula feeding. I don't have anything against women who formula feed but I don't understand why a mother would not at least attempt to breastfeed.<br>  <br>  I mean, if it didn't work out or the mother didn't like it, fine. At least the effort was made. Babies benefit from any amount of breast milk, even if it's just colostrum.<br>  <br>  With that said, I'm not here to beat anyone up over how they feed their baby. I've made my choices, they've made theirs. I don't see why some of the women here make it into a huge dramatic battle.
d6e11chxaa	I think Layla is the simplest and most familiar. I would go with it. I think Layla Violet Desoto is the nicest combo. Isabel is pretty, but makes her name sound like a question.

aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Because adoption is no longer a social service for children. <br>  <br>  It's become a multi-billion dollar industry which covets babies to its paying customers' demands serving the customers' best interests over that of the children.<br>  <br>  What it has turned into is a mess<br>  <br>  ETA:  To the first answerer.  I disagree.   Babies are not 'blank slates'|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	i am not sire why but right now we only have room for one more child . i have a daughter who is 16 months . and wanted to get an older child like in there early teens or around 9 or so . but i know that we will . so not everyone wants infants|`|2wyDALHgaa	I really don't think this impression is 100% accurate.  Studies done a few years ago by academics at McGill University in Canada showed that about 85% of the people surveyed related that they would gladly adopt older children and many of them said they would consider adoptions of children with disabilities and such.  The problem was though that they sited a number of reasons why they either didn't or wouldn't adopt under the current systems.  They sited such things as a lack of coordination between agencies and departments, a lack of available resources for assistance after adoption and other various reasons.  I've posted quotes from the study before however I'm not on my usual computer at this time and I don't have the link to the studies to cut and paste a more comprehensive breakdown.  Either way, to me it indicates that people would adopt older children if the assistance and supports were in place to assist them.|`|HmkCFddAaa	Being a parent is a learning experience. When you don't have any children you don't know how to deal with a older child or a teenager. Let alone one who has possibly been abused or mistreated. You get the experience as you raise your child. A young couple wants a young baby that way the family can grow together, and they can develop their parenting skills. Those who have older children are more prepared to handle the problems that come with older children.  Every age group is different in the way you have to parent them, and if you don't know how to it's a bad thing for all concerned especially the child.|`|BTuFtui3aa	I think there are several reasons for choosing an infant:<br>  <br>  1.) Feeling they would be "missing out" on the milestones of childhood: first steps, first word, first day of kindergarten, etc.<br>  <br>  2.) Desire to recreate the experience of raising a biological child as closely as possible, if they are unable to conceive.<br>  <br>  3.) Concern that an older child will be "damaged," have psychological disturbances, have behaviour problems, etc.<br>  <br>  I can sort of understand the first reason, as those are important parenting experiences, but at the same time there's a lot more to the overall parenting experience than any of those specific things. I don't think that starting from infancy is necessary to have a "complete" parenting experience, as parenting is more complex and emotional than just watching your kids hit developmental milestones.<br>  <br>  The second reason doesn't really work. An adopted child is not the same as a biological child, and parenting an adopted child requires some different things. An adopted child may turn out not to be like their adoptive parents in personality, interests, gifts, appearance, etc. So you can't really adopt a child as a substitute-- children can't be replaced. An adopted child needs to be accepted on his/her own terms.<br>  <br>  The third one is tricky, because parenting an older child DOES require dedication, patience, and perhaps a greater degree of unconditional love. Not because these kids are worth less than others, but because they have extra needs that must be met. However, I think a lot of older kids, especially foster kids, are stereotyped. A child isn't a delinquent or predator because of being in foster care. Being abused doesn't mean a child can't find happiness and some measure of healing with kind caretakers. Having some extra behaviour or emotional issues doesn't make a kid bad, or unworthy of love.<br>  <br>  These kids deserve all the good things possible in life... but they're passed over, because of concerns they'll be too much trouble, or the prospective parents' fears that they can't deal. That's sad. And I think it's often unnecessary.<br>  <br>  I do on one level get wanting an infant. Parenting an older child ISN'T an identical experience. But it's at least as emotionally rewarding-- if not more so-- and it's very worthwhile. I wish more people who wanted to adopt would at least CONSIDER an older child instead of a baby or a toddler.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	Adoptive parents often wish to raise a child as if it were their biological child and one without problems. A child they can watch growing without any "baggage".<br>  <br>  And some of these answers are incredible. <br>  <br>  Let's clear a few things up.<br>  <br>  a) Babies are not blank slates. Babies are born with a personality and some people claim to remember being in the womb and scientists are starting to discover this is possible. <br>  <br>  b) I see a lot of isms here. Discrimination against disabled children, discrimination against innocent children who happen to have problems because of other people. Sure, it takes money and time and emotional strength, but even infants develop serious issues in later years.<br>  <br>  Sure, many infant adoptions go well, but many also don't. Babies are also not all perfect and problem free. If they had an inheritted condition (mental or physical) that came up later, would it be okay to take them back for a refund? What if they were in an accident and you had to care for their every need? <br>  <br>  c) Adopting a child from foster care, even if they have problems, will take them out of an insecure place, and if placed with a nurturing family with empathy and compassion then that experience will lead them to a better path. Many foster children go from home to home, constantly rejected and misplaced. Many of them turn out fine, but others enter into a patturn of distruction that could be avoided if more people would consider adopting from foster care.|`|sbHJCxWCaa	Because many people still believe that infants are blank slates and that they will have experienced less trauma than older children and so will be able to be molded into fitting into the family. Also, infants have little remembrance of their first family, so parents believe that they can just pretend the child is their own, without having to acknowledge the first family. <br>  <br>  Children who are older have more baggage, and since many Ap's aren't adopting for selfless reasons like wanting to provide a home for a child (they would rather have a child/infant for their home, if you catch that difference), they end up adopting infants.|`|3i7hufq4aa	I went into adoption only wanting older children. I love the idea of finding out what our kiddo's personality is like, her interests, and especially her memories. I like the idea of being able to integrate her immediately into our family activities, and learning from her. I like that she is coming to our family with an already established sense of her own culture, and that (with careful nurturing, hopefully) she won't need to relearn her own language. I like that she may have clear memories of her birth family, to help with her sense of self later on, even if we are unlikely to find them. And, we are up to the inevitable challenge.|`|fPFXJr3eaa	Like Heather said, adoption is no longer about the needs of a child/baby these days but has become a service for those who cannot have babies naturally to seek what they WANT (vs what they actually need) elsewhere.<br>  <br>  To actually think in your mind (not 'you' but anyone in general) it is okay for a mother and baby to part so that another couple, biological, spiritual etc strangers can raise him/her is actually unethical.  Nature has not intended mothers and their babies to be separated and to do this creates issues, heartache and pain that resound through generations.  We are now in the age of "I'll have whatever I can have whatever way I can regardless of how it affects another human being".  Most infants are NOT being given up willingly... much coercion, brainwashing and pressure is applied so these women feel guilty for even wanting to raise their OWN babies.<br>  <br>  Adoption has outlived its need to exist in a world where secrets are no longer acceptable.  There are many other ways of caring for a child in NEED of care out of their natural family and the adoption guillotine is not necessary.  Permanent Care, parenting orders, custody, guardianship... anything short of an actual adoption order which only seeks to serve those adopting and not the child or their natural parents at all.<br>  <br>  Infant adoption is a very sick practise today indeed.  It has become a business and a baby has become a mere commodity to be sold and purchased by the highest bidder.  Children are not seen as human beings merely objects to fulfil a desire.  Unethical and immoral, infant adoption should be the first to go.<br>  <br>  And one last point, it has been proven babies ARE NOT blank slates when born.  Anyone who chooses to believe this do so at the detriment of the child and to fulfil their own purpose.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Because the "industry" perpetuates this.  People WRONGLY assume that these babies will just fit perfectly into their families because they are blank slates. People want what they believe they cannot have on their own.  <br>  <br>  I think that another perpetuated myth is that older children who are also up for adoption are somehow "damaged goods".  They, in fact, need a family more than the infant.  A healthy infant will always find someone willing to take them.  An older child, regardless of health and mental conditions, will be harder to place.<br>  <br>  I think many people feel that to get the "full experience" of parenting, they must start with a child as young as possible to raise them "as if".<br>  <br>  Wrong, very wrong.  There are many children out there needing homes.  Some have problems that need to be dealt with.  This doesn't make them any less in need.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Because a lot of people want a baby.  They think that an older child can't bond with them or love them like a baby can. They think older children were rejected by their bio parents for some reason so they can't possibly be worth raising. They think they are "damaged goods" and don't want the baggage.  <br>  <br>  There are many ignorant reasons that people won't adopt older children.<br>  <br>  Fortunately I'm not ignorant. :)  We're adopting a 9 or 10 yr old boy. Hopefully by the end of this year if all goes well.<br>  <br>  I feel that older children, because they have been through so much, deserve a family a lot more than an infant that has a better chance right off the bat.|`|850zmycZaa	The reason is that so many people out there long for a baby. And if they cannot conceive a baby, they want to adopt a baby. They want to be able to raise a child from infant to adult. <br>  <br>  Now I used to be a social worker and I have seen these kinds of people and I can understand where they come from. They want a baby even though there are over 1,000,000 foster kids in the United States looking for forever families, as my favorite radio host Delilah puts it. They get so blind by the yearn for a baby, they forget about the older ones.<br>  <br>  It's sad, I know. And while people should adopt older kids, it's good they also adopt babies. Both ways, they are helping a child have a lasting home.<br>  <br>  I have never adopted, but I have given up my son for adoption when I was 16. The hardest decision I ever had to make. But I made that decision. And the couple who adopted him, was looking to adopt just a baby. No older children. Back then I thought that was fine. But now that I look back on it, I think "What would've made such a big difference? They were helping a child either way?". Some people just get so hooked on the idea of a baby, that's all they want.|`|frpCK0utaa	Well, because it's the whole blank slate theory, in a sense. A lot of people feel they will bond easier with a child the younger they are. The older a child is, the harder people think it will be. So, they go for infants. That way, they get to experience all the milestones, such as first word, first steps, first everything. Sadly, this leaves out so many children who need homes, and will never get them because they are considered too old.<br>  <br>  It's really sad.
rFRo6DGTaa	your 32 weeks along? around that time I started to have the same cramping, its probably really strong braxton hicks i remember thinking that I would have my daughter early. I had that same cramping until 42 weeks when I finally had the real labor pains, you will definitely know the difference when that time comes. But until then go ahead and go to the doctors, if anything it will just be peace of mind. Good luck and I hope the rest of your last few weeks go as smooth as possible.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Irritating period-like cramps are how I would describe stage one labour.  Lower right side of your back sounds like the baby's anterior - what did they think at the last check?  I reckon his shoulderbone is digging in when you get a cramp.<br>  <br>  Here's the thing:  if it just happens occasionally, not to worry.  If your waters break, then time starts to run out on when the baby can be born. For as long as they're intact you're fairly safe - or rather, the baby is farily safe from infection.  It's when your waters break and you've got 2 weeks of diddly pushing that you can start to freak a bit...lol.  <br>  <br>  I would certainly start thinking about taking things easy, putting my feet up when I can.  Go see the doctor, but beware: a cervix check could speed up the labour and you don't want that.  I'm not sure if it always does speed labour up or if my midwife just got something wrong....  Ask.  <br>  <br>  Certainly see the doctor.  It is not braxton hicks: it seems far more like 1st stage labour.  Don't fret though:  just take it smoothly, wander on in to the doctor's, and cross your fingers you don't have a prem baby.  You eating properly?|`|b3eqhjRraa	Talk to your doctor. My mom went into preterm labor at 24 weeks, so I expressed my concerns to my doctor. He ordered that I have my cervix checked with my first ultrasound at 22 weeks.|`|YWAoSctPaa	No, she shouldn't. It depends on how old you are I guess. It would definitely be in your best benefit to get it checked than not!|`|i6gZ5GQgaa	Yes you can request a cervix check.  I do it for free.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	If you are concerned then i don't see why your doctor wouldn't check. Most of us are scared to ask so why not just ask. She should do it. She has no reason to really say no. Just tell her that you are paranoid and if she doesn't check you are going to be paranoid until she does check. Good Luck & god Bless|`|uQc4UA2Caa	not at all. im only 29 weeks and i want mine checked.<br>  u might have your baby early but your body might also just be getting ready|`|veMA1a6paa	Actually, as you get closer to your due date, you will experience some cramping and discomfort. They are called Braxton Hicks contractions and it is just your bodys way of getting prepared for labor. If you are having a real concern about it, I would bring it up to your doc, what you are feeling,  and see what he or she suggests.|`|98WKYtfwaa	No, it's not a big job to check your cervix so she shouldn't have a problem doing so. If you feel theres a problem make sure you get it checked out.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Your doctor is there to serve you! Yes, you can ask. You may be dialeted or may not.|`|duinadV4aa	no you can ask and see what happens she probably will check you
P4LBygv2aa	its called anxiety . <br>  go to the nurse in school and explain it.<br>  my son had it.<br>  they thought it was vertigo until the tests were done.|`|G6x9SCWoaa	the bumps behind your ears are lymph nodes. they are quite common actually.<br>  <br>  it signals that you most likely have an ear infecion. you shoud go see your doc to get anti biotics<br>  <br>  feel better!|`|1FV4d59saa	I am not a doctor, but it sounds to me like you have MONO. It's really common among teens and it lasts anywere form 3 weeks- a year. I had it for about 9 months in the 7th grade. It generally gives you flu like symptoms only milder, and makes you very tired all the time. The bumps behind your ears are called your lymph nodes and they swell up when your body is trying to fight of an infection or sickness, very common during MONO. It is a virus that you can get just like a cold or anything else, its just a little bit rarer, kind of like strep but worse. Its super common among teenagers. If you go to your doctor and ask about it, they can give youa blood test to see if you have it or not, and even tell you about how much longer you will be sick.  Also, the good news is that you can only catch MONO once in your life, like the chicken pox. I dont know if you have it or not, but it sound like you do to me..|`|PqQZRBjnaa	Well dizziness can be caused by lack of energy (that would explain your tiredness), keep asking your mum to take you to the doctor,tell her you feel dizzy and those bumps behind your head could be harmful (I personally don't know what they re). Headache..mm try PARACETAMOL 500ml tablets, perfectly harmless. You really should see a doctor if it gets any worse. Try to eat more energy foods and protein: meat, fish, tofu (if your a vegaterian), beans etc.<br>  <br>  Kerry xo|`|2bBVI52Uaa	ask another family member to take you to the doctor|`|n1NjjzmAaa	DUDE, I'm going through the same thing as you right now :S.

BKCwQn2Eaa	well i went last week for a scan at 21 weeks and they told me my baby weight 1lb 3 oz.s was bigger than normal and my doc told me everything was fine just to prepare for a 9 - 10 lb baby .... good luck i'm very nervous ... lol ...  but then again me and my hubby were both 8 lb babies|`|0fa8cecdd79ffd76d48c4c83b19e75b3aa	at 23 weeks my baby weighed 1lb 9oz....just had an ultrasound last week and she is now 9lbs 2oz!! I am being induced tomorrow night so we will see how much she weighs at birth!! My doctor told me to prepare for a large baby when we saw how much she weighed at 23 weeks, so If i were you I would prepare for a large baby 8-10 Lbs...Good luck..
rU6gvHFkaa	Babysitting is always a great way to go. If you do not know of anyone than ask your mom or friends if they know of anyone that would like a babysitter if that doesn't work then go to the places that you might want to work at and ask them for an application. Try clothing stores cuz most of them will give you a discount on their clothes. I think you also have to be 16 to get a work permit but it might have changed, I don't know. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you find the job you are looking for.|`|xbgCwmbdaa	Try local Greenhouses. They are so fun to work at and you learn a lot about agriculture.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	I thought you had to be at least 16 to work in fast food places. Well at least thats how it is here.

I can't vouch for the veracity, but I read somewhere online that the relaxin your body releases to relax your joints will affect your diaphragm, making it harder to breathe and contributing to breathlessness.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Do you have a heart condition or asthma?

bMZ7lOfVaa	I love the name Camila and with the nickname of Mila. Very pretty!|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I think the name Mila is beautiful.  In my opinion why name your child something if you just intend to call them something else.  If you name her Camila, but intend to call her Mila, the only time the full name Camila will come out is when she's in trouble LOL.<br>  <br>  If you really like the name Mila just go with it!|`|igvUbqkyaa	Isn't Camila pronounced CUH-MIL-LUH?? That is how I/everybody I know pronounces the name!! Also I think Mila is more of a nickname and most people will pronounce it wrong if it is alone. I just don't think Mila looks like a complete name.|`|d6e11chxaa	I think Camilla is a gorgeous name! I would use that as a given name and nickname her Mila. My sister's name is Amelia and we call her Mila a lot of the time.|`|AA10961212	Camila|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	Mila|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Camila, you can have the best of both worlds :)|`|3EXmT91Haa	I like both- but I Like Camila more|`|gPbmjeT0aa	Camila, that way you would have both names and one is more sophisticated for her when she's older!!!|`|GSqn7Cu0aa	Mila is a cute name i know a little kid with that name and if her name was camila they probably call her mila|`|0b68457e86fc84d24ef1fbc7aa994532aa	Camila as her first name but you can nickname her Mila|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I prefer Camila but if you're going to call her Mila then why not just name her Mila.|`|T1j73RZpaa	Then go with Camila. You'll have the best of both worlds. ;D|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I loooove Mila. :] It's pretty much one of my favorites. I prefer it as a nickname for Milena, but it sounds so foreign and elegant. Good luck!|`|cErLq7f3aa	i like them both but i would say Mila|`|CxRJwJsraa	I like Camila.<br>  <br>  But, I LOVE Mila. She works just fine as a name, on her own.

Jf3DIPcNaa	make sure it's new and from a trustworthy seller. Used carseats can be dangerous if they have been in an accident it can weaken important parts of the seat and then it can fail if you have an accident. You can't tell by looking at a seat if it's ever been in a car accident. Just be careful. It's not worth saving a few bucks if it puts your baby in danger.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	good experience.  I bought a Maclaren Volo new in the package stroller for 70 dollars, free shipping.<br>  <br>  Look for the feedback the percent that is high, and look to see they have been selling for a long time.|`|4yGGjs7zaa	i have never brought either off ebay! i think it would be ok to buy a stroller but not a carseat! it is said that if you have a crash and you have a child seat to replace it whether or not it is damaged for safety reasons, so buying a car seat may not be the safest option!
kfWi9ZkEaa	Go to the doctor and see what thsi discharge is. You could have an infection, or you could be pregnant, or you could just have some bung plumbing for a while.  I'd probably just wander in there casually and get a bit of a checkup.<br>  <br>  As to contraception, talk to doctor about the IUD's you can get nowadays, that don't hurt and can be used really well by people who get bad periods.  (Used to be a reason not to get an IUD.)  You may be pregnant, which is lovely and the more the merrier (serves hubby right for his DIY morning after pill lol!) but after that birth you might want to think about an IUD or something....|`|uuceuyRyaa	I agree Faint line = Pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Grants on the little one!=)<br>  <br>  get a doctors appt. for a blood test if you still don't believe it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|jHH3G56Jaa	Faint line......= pregnancy|`|plI0WOrUaa	Its possible you are pregnant.

Test again, and good luck to you.|`|DoaMYpfMaa	well i would have gone to the doctor for the morning after pill but your periods might be late because you used your birth control and that might cause it to become irregular especially if not used correctly|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Hhhmmm...well go to the doctor & get a blood test!!|`|CC9MO4AJaa	3 pills the day after DOES NOT work.

rTAvnldfaa	its been a while since my little boy was on feeds but based on a feed every 3-4 hours i'd say 6- 8 bottles in a 24 hour period but, some babies sleep through the night in which case there would only be maybe 4 - 6 in 24 hours.|`|pXSKSS3daa	How ever many they need. There is no "should" at that age. Babies need to feed on demand.<br>  <br>  Generally, though, babies that age drink 2-4 oz. of formula every 2-3 hours. At every 2 hours it's around 12 bottles.|`|yB5go5wbaa	Maaaaaybe... about 2-3 ounces every 3 or 4 hours.|`|4WJM3j9Aaa	depending on the weight of th baby..but no more than 4 oz every 4 hours...so about 5 or 6 depending on when the baby sleeps at night

Ep0CpwDbaa	I don't believe in spankings, but hypothetically I would've spanked them both the same way. I mean, if there was a significant age difference between the girls, such as 12 and 4, then I would have given the older one a much heavier punishment since it was also her fault for not looking after her younger sister and setting a bad example for her. The younger one didn't know better and she was more than likely just copying her big sister whom she looked up to.<br>  <br>  But in this case, the girls were aged 12 and 10, and both of them knew better than to be playing with matches. They both would've received the same punishment because both of them were irresponsible.<br>  <br>  If I had to spank more than one child, and had to make sure that the spankings were fair, I'd just base it upon how big of a role each child played in the misbehavior and whether the child knew better or not.<br>  <br>  [e] Also, to add my own opinion on the whole spanking debate, I don't spank my own children but I do believe that spanking is effective on some children and is not effective on others. Some children learn more meaningful lessons when spanked; others do not. So I really think it depends on the child.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I wouldn't spank my kid.<br>  <br>  The punishment is useless.I was spanked as a child and it didn't teach me anything.<br>  <br>  What the mother needs to do is talk to the kids about WHY playing with matches is not a  smart thing to do and ground their asses for it.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	well the kids learned you get hit for playing with matches not that they are dangerous. So, I wouldn't have hit them at all.|`|8PA7ndf8aa	I wouldn't spank them. First they have to know that matches are dangerous.  In a controlled enviroment show them what could happen.  My second child is a visual learner and it was the best way for her to see what could happen. Then explain to them if you catch them playing with them again what the consequence will be. Timeout, spanking, taking things away. Whatever you do teach first then dicipline.  <br>  <br>  Each child is different and needs differnt things. Fair is making sure each child gets what they need in life. My first I could threaten with a spanking and she would straighten right up. My second could care less how many times she got spanked. It wouldn't phase her a bit. Putting her in time out drove her crazy.  She has to be in the middle of things with her sisters.  My first could sit in time out all day and be content. <br>  <br>  It depends on each child and what their needs are to be fair.|`|7bc597034795bea4dbbecfea92484579aa	The very first thing I'd do is find the parent who was dumb enough to leave the matches out where the girls could find and play with them.  That's the person who needs the punishment in this situation.<br>  And my kids do get spankings, but never with their pants down - that's abusive in an indecent sort of way.<br>  Just my opinions though....|`|2iXuzHgwaa	Well, I am a mom to only a two year old, so its different, but if they two children were doing the same thing, I believe the punishment should be the same also.|`|rJjjvHdDaa	Well first off spanking is illegal in a few places and I think that the mom over reacted I am totally against spanking and it's a FACT that spanking lowers the childs IQ|`|850zmycZaa	Um, I don't believe in spankings. So I would never consider this. I'd yell if it were something like that and then ground the child. SPANKING is VIOLENCE people. Use WORDS not your FISTS!|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	As dangerous as playing with matches are,,,I don't believe in spanking > I think the time out method is the best ( so far ) lol|`|tBtOTiQDaa	yep<br>  same offense, same punishment<br>  but i think that girl's a troll|`|N7P52rdgaa	Depending on the ages yes they should be given the same punishment... If they had been 3 and 10 prob not.. The 3 year old would not get a spanking as hard or as many... to ensure the fairness so that the older one did not get upset you should punish them in different rooms. Do not let them see each other get their punishment but let them know that the other did get punished as well... <br>  For all you folks that don't believe in spanking that is your opinion but I feel that spanking is fine and not abusive or violent... I was spanked as a child and it taught me things that were right and wrong.. I have a 152 IQ, graduated with special honors with my first degree and working with a 4.0 average on my second one... I am in the law enforcement community and live my life in church also. I have a 21/2 yr old and an 81/2 year old. They get spankings when things are very bad (things in light sockets, touching things on a hot stove), they get sent to their room when it's a light offense. Talking however does no good because it goes in one ear and out the other. That's what is wrong with a lot of the youth now days they only got talked to and it really didn't mean a whole lot to them.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	come here ..You piss ME off ..I want to freaking smack you , you abusive piece of chit|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Same amount!
SxPhldhhaa	The best thing you can do right now is to let her work things out on her own. I say this because I'm 13 as well, and to be perfectly blunt, your daughter will just seem "weird" or "uncool" if you appear to be interfering with her social life - and I'm not saying that you are, or that you're doing anything wrong, but the other girls at your daughter's school will most likely be looking for excuses to make fun of her and this is something they can leech onto easily.<br>  <br>  Tell her how bad you feel, and let her know that you care about her and want to be happy. Tell her that you're not trying to interfere with her life - which she probably thinks you are - and apologize if you've annoyed her. Say that you know that losing friends and having to start over is really hard for her, and encourage her to find new friends at her new school.<br>  <br>  If you want to, you could even take her out to buy some clothes or anything else she might want to help her "fit in." This may or may not be a good idea for you, but if I were her I would feel better knowing that my mom understood what I was going through. You can also have a little mother-daughter bonding time while out and she may feel more confident about herself.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your family! I really hope your daughter makes some friends and comes to enjoy California.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	bad age to rock her stability..she should come before you..always|`|pPlVUIA8aa	She needs to learn to deal. She will get over herself soon enough.|`|OFdCY2Owaa	Have a fun girl's day out on the town. Get to know California with her and talk to her while you shop and eat or go see a movie. Reassure her that this is for the best.<br>  Also, take a visit back to Arizona this summer and go back every two or three years.|`|5q7uPqVmaa	I don't know if this will help but I'm a teacher and I had a new student who moved into my class from Tennessee.  What's really weird was that I subsequently found out that his experience in Tennessee was horrible----apparently he was failing school, defiant to the teacher, from his file it seemed like he had no friends and was a horrible kid and failing school.  (Really glad I didn't see the file until 3 monthes into the school year....the day it arrived, the special education teacher came to observe him and when she asked who he was, looked at me strangely when I pointed him out, shook her head and said she never would have guessed.)  He wasn't like that with me but he had a very hard time adjusting at the beginning; wouldn't talk, would rarely try to finish any work, and wasn't making friends mostly because he wouldn't talk to anybody not because they were particularly unfriendly.  Things turned around when we had two kids move out of class within a few weeks and the kids who were left behind felt kinda mopey.  We talked about how when things change it's okay to grieve for what has been lost.  Nobody died but you've lost the way things were and it's okay to miss what was.  You won't feel better overnight but eventually you will feel better.  All of sudden, I saw this kid who'd been having a hard time nodding his head like he knew what I was talking about.  I wanted to shake him and ask why he was grieving when his last year at school had obviously been horrible for whatever reason.  If he was grieving when he'd had a bad year, think about how much your daughter must be grieving a good experience in Arizona.  Plus, it sounds like she's had a lot of changes all at once anyway.  Don't forget she's 13---when anybody that I've ever liked has been miserable for some reason or another anyway!|`|yCUOXInFaa	Give her time, give her space, she needs to grieve for the loss of her time in Arizona..... <br>  At school she will make her own friends and in time she will start socialising, let her lead her own destiny, don't try to do it for her. Just be there for her and you will be best of friends again.|`|839bc9c7b7c52e9c21d72f0e733af171aa	i think you should take her around the town and show her all the fun things she can do while she there. Set up some play dates with other parents in the community so she can make friends!|`|2iXuzHgwaa	First of all, dont invite anyone over for her. Thirteen year olds are in a defiante stage, and it doesn't help to have her mother making her friends for her.<br>  Things will make her happy, try getting her out of the house and to a movie with her siblings, maybe she will socialize.

BilLTGLFaa	Dad's sperm determines the sex. Women can only donate the XX chromosome, Men donate the XX(female) OR XY(male).|`|GLJkGgloaa	It's the Daddy.<br>  Women are XX and Daddy's are XY.<br>  So you get an X from mommy and either an x or Y from daddy.<br>  You get an X you get a Girl, You get a Y...you got yourself a baby boy!|`|85V6cHe4aa	Its the fathers sperm,the womans egg always carries the X chromosome whereas the mans sperm can be X or Y.<br>  <br>  If x from the man meets the female egg a girl is concieved,if its y its a boy.|`|YCICrIKyaa	All I have ever heard is that the man who actually determine it... It doesn't seem that way though for me or my partner. On my side, all women have had boys first, and I'm expecting my first, a boy, in a couple weeks. My partner, who is female, her family has only had females. She's not pregnant but if she one day decides to go through with it, I'd bet it'd be female. I just don't get it.|`|AA12045802	The Father.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	the father.|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	from what i have read it is the father.|`|AA12395149	The dad does.  Sex is determined by the X and Y genes.  Every egg a woman has in her carries a single X gene.  About 50% of the man's sperm carry an X gene and 50% carry a Y gene.  If a X sperm meets an egg you XX and thus, a girl.  If a Y sperm meets an egg you have XY and thus a boy.  <br>  <br>  So hands down, genetically speaking, the dad determines the sex.  however, there can be things about the woman that can either hinder or help either the X or Y sperm along.  The Ys are faster, but weaker (just like a man, huh? :-)  The Xs are a bit slower, but more durable (they can survive in more acidic environments for longer - the vagina and uterus are more acidic and warmer than what sperm typically enjoy).  Just thought I'd throw in that extra tid bit of info.|`|81bd6d1d0c0eef55c6c7c2a1f1f1a3ccaa	I think it's the father's sperm that determines the sex of the baby.

285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	It's easier to get babies outside the country than domestically.  It's also easier to get white babies from Russia and other countries than from America.  People are afraid if they adopt in America that they will have the mother of the child in their life, either immediately or later, or that an American who gives up a baby was drinking or using drugs.  With a Chinese baby, for example, people believe that the mother was taking care of herself and not drinking, and they can get a baby, not an older child like in America.<br>  <br>  This probably sounds very offensive -- I apologize if it does.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	I agree. But then again, there are way more children to adopt in Africa and Asia then there are in America - so that's obvioulsy a factor.<br>  That and most people don't give up healthy babies in the US.|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	You might be able to find some stats here:  <a href="http://statistics.adoption.com/" rel="nofollow">http://statistics.adoption.com/</a><br>  I just wanted to add the argument that adoption isn't an alternative to pregnancy, only to parenthood.  Just something to think about.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	abortion and adoption are NOT related.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I think its actually the opposite. More domestic adoptions are done each year than international. <br>  <br>  From what I could find online it looked like only around 14% of adoptions were international or around 20,000 per year. <br>  <br>  International adoption is talked about much more often and is usually quite obvious (ex. white parents with a chinese baby). Celebrities have brought international adoption into the mainstream media which gives the allusion that it is more popular and common than it really is.|`|2wyDALHgaa	While I don't have the statistics at hand I am confident that it's not the case.  While many feel the number of international adoptions is too high, by far there are more domestic adoptions being done in the US, and in Canada.  The second link below in particular provides some insight into domestic and international adoption stats, as best as can be gathered at least.

e105cfb2a3df44e1d4835131ebd93824aa	Well your mother and mother in law are correct, the guidelines are 'back to sleep' i work on a Neonatal Unit and if we nurse babies on there tummies we attach a respiration monitor onto them as the risk of SIDS is high. We also strongly recommend parents sleep babies on there backs.<br>  However if your baby will only sleep on his front and you are getting no sleep when he is on his back then you are a bit stuck!! Have you spoken to your health visitor about this? She can check him over to find out if there are any underlying causes, when you say he coughs it makes me wonder if he suffers from reflux. Mention this to the health visitor. Or is it possible he just coughs because he is crying?<br>  If you are going to nurse him on his stomach buy one of those <br>  mattresses that are fitted with a sensor, it clicks as baby breathes and alarms if breathing stops. My friend uses one of these and it gives her peace of mind. Do you find he is ok on his back in a car seat or baby chair? These are clues that lying flat is a problem (and again reflux springs to mind) so mention these to the health visitor. Finally stop being so hard on yourself, you are doing your best,<br>  Good luck Xx|`|AnRpmytLaa	I know that we probably slept on our tummies when we were babies (as advised at the time) but since 'back to sleep' was introduced the number of SIDS cases has dramatically reduced. Advice and recommendations change as more is researched and understood. <br>  Believe it or not it was once thought that smoking was good for you!|`|efe0d3ff34905cd2401ab184bb90f5ecaa	I know what they say but my son was the same way if you put him on his back he cried all night and i got no sleep. My opinion is my mom survived it, my brother survived it and so did i. Just be sure to keep an eye in him and get some much needed rest. I felt guilty until my mom said i lived through it and so did every one of my aunts and uncles. And there are nine of them.|`|is9x38oLaa	20 years ago, children had to be put in bed on their tummy to be safe. It changes often. <br>  You are not a bad mother for doing it. People who say so are stupids|`|ykBFIszDaa	Unless the baby can roll over on its own it shouldn't be placed on its stomach to sleep. Once it can roll over from back to stomach then it is fine because he would be able to roll back if he needs to. <br>  <br>  My daughter had the same problem around that age and we got NO sleep. Unfortunately the Dr told us that this was a big risk and we have a friend who's child care provider laid the 2 1/2 month old down to sleep on its stomach and it suffocated. We suffered through it and fortunately our daughter started rolling at 3 months.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	The issue here is that no one really knows what causes SIDS. There is some kind of "x-factor" involved, either genetic or environmental that has yet to be discovered.<br>  <br>  What is known is that when babies are put on their backs, the risk of SIDS decreases.<br>  <br>  I, like almost all children in the 70's, slept on my tummy as an infant.  Obviously most of us survived.<br>  <br>  The data suggests that the majority of infants could be placed on their backs and not be at risk of SIDS.  However, since the actual cause of SIDS is unknown, it is impossible to know if *your* baby is one of those babies.<br>  <br>  For this reason, most parents opt to have their babies sleep on their backs.<br>  <br>  It is still your choice, obviously.  Statistically, you're fine.  But in many situations, statistics are cold comfort.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	My baby was the same way. He didn't like sleeping on his back. He still doesn't and he's 8 months old. I got him a "side sleeper" which looks like two small wedges that are connected by a flap of material. You can place baby on his side or mostly on his tummy without fear of his face being in the mattress. I did this for my son, and by 3 months, he was sleeping through the night 12 hours at a time! Now that he's bigger, I don't use the side sleeper, and he almost ALWAYS rolls onto his tummy. Sometimes I feel nervous, but I know that he's smart enough to roll onto his back as well. He's just a tummy baby, and I'm a tummy mama, and my hubby's a tummy daddy. We all sleep on our tummy! :) Also, I hate to say this, but if it is our child's time to go, the Lord will take him whether he's on his tummy or his back. My dad was an emt, and went on quite a few SIDS calls. Not all the babies were on their tummy when the Lord called them home. Try the side sleeper! Let me know what you think and if it works! Good luck and God bless!|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I don't think it is bad. I think as long as you check on him, and he is healthy, and not in an environment with cigarette smoke, he is fine. If you are feeling guilty about it, you can get a sids monitor. It is called angel care I think. It has a mat that you put under the baby's mattress, and it detects every tiny movement. If there is no movement for 20 or 30 seconds, an alarm sounds in the baby's room, and over the monitor.|`|3MelQFxOaa	Maybe he is coughing because he may have asthma, (like the doctors think my daughter has it) or acid reflux. You should talk to your doctor about that. I know I will get thumbs down, but I think you should just lay your baby on its back-even if he does cry. I believe that always giving in, and allowing him to sleep on his stomach, makes him know that if he just cries, he will get what he wants? I really do think he may have acid reflux though because it sounds like a comfort issue if he coughs a lot on his back. My advice, give your doctor a call, they should help.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	17 yrs ago I followed all the guidelines and I ended up like you - totally exhausted and with PND to boot.  She hated being on her back.  My neighbour cuddled her then when she fell asleep she lay her on tummy in moses basket but when I went to move her she told me she had all her 4 kids on their tummy.  It was actually the BEST night sleep she ever had but I didn't as I was up worrying all night !!   With my second baby I just did what I felt was comfortable and from day 5 he slept almost through the night - well a good 5 hr stretch any way.  I did same with 3rd.  Even laying them on their side with a rolled up hand towel to support their backs.  We didn't smoke anyway - we told our Health Visitor when she came to do the first home visit but she said that even though we had told her she would still put down we were putting our son on his back otherwise she would be called in to her manager !!!   I think you have to weigh up the other forces that contribute to Cot Death too.  If every other factor has been removed then you have to do what is right for you.  They can only make suggestions and I know I will be slammed for this comment but do what you feel is right.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Everyone (or most everyone) will give you a talk about putting him on his tummy and tell you to only let him sleep on his back... But I have seen countless post of people letting their child sleep on their tummy. I let my son. He's now 6 months. The reason they say sleeping on the tummy increases the chance of sids is because of the carbon dioxide pulling around his face.. That's the only reason that I have heard. Other than the chance of him getting face down. <br>  <br>  Seriously I think if he can move his head from side to side while on his tummy he's fine. That's just my opinion..
HBgnkltfaa	My favorites are Fiona Eve and Sicily Rose.  They're uncommon but still familiar and very wearable.  They're also names that will work equally well on a little girl or grown woman.  I slightly prefer Sicily spelled Cecily (Sicily is a place name, while Cecily is a form of Cecilia), but they're both lovely, and the choice is up to you.  Eve is one of my favorite middles (it's both innocent and a little bit sexy), and Rose is a classic that pairs well with an uncommon first.<br>  <br>  Second favorite set are Audrey Kathleen and Gwyneth Paige.  I like the movie-star vibe of the first names, but I also like that they don't feel "too celebrity," as the names are fairly well-known apart from the movie stars.  The only reason these combos are my second-strings is that I'm not crazy about the middles.  The combos flow well, but I don't find Paige and Kathleen very exciting.  Just personal taste, and not something that should concern you.  If you like them, use them.<br>  <br>  The reasons I wouldn't recommend the other names:<br>  -- Paris and Harlow are far too celebrity-associated (and the celebrities they're associated with seem a bit trashy).<br>  -- Isabella, Sophia, Brianna, and Taylor are way too popular right now.  Isabella and Sophia are top-10 names; Brianna and Taylor are trendy top-30 names.  While it's not always bad to choose a popular name, it's best to choose one that won't date itself, and these four are bound to go out of style and sound very dated to this decade.<br>  --  Amanda feels dated to the 1980's, especially paired with another 80's-favorite like Michelle.<br>  -- Gracie is too juvenile.  It's a cute nickname, but put Grace on the birth certificate.<br>  -- Cassidy was a trendy 90's name that is now on its way out.<br>  <br>  Middle names from your list that I do like are Claire, Alison, Elizabeth, Grace, and Kate.  I think any of them would make great first names, so if you like them well enough, you may consider arranging some combos with those.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|MW1yrHbOaa	hannah marie<br>  cassidy marie<br>  harlow grace<br>  taylor allison<br>  these are my favs, hard for me to pick out of these 4. good name choices, congratulations|`|AA11138222	Paris Elizabeth--2 Please don't use Paris, Hilton is all anyone will think of! <br>  Gracie Ann--7 I love the name Gracie, but Ann is sorta boring.<br>  Hannah Marie--3 Too blah for my taste.<br>  Cassidy Marie--6 Cassidy is nice, but it needs a spunkier middle name.<br>  Harlow Grace--5 I'd say 8 if you flip them to Grace Harlow <br>  Taylor Alison--1 I don't like Taylor at all. <br>  Isabella Renee--6 Pretty but Isabella (and the nickname Bella) is too common.<br>  Brianna Claire--8 I'm not a huge fan of either name, but together they really sound great. <br>  Amanda Michelle ( Mandy)--3 I really don't like Mandy...and Amanda is just plain.<br>  Sicily Rose--6 I think this is a cool original name.  <br>  Fiona Eve--2 Shrek is all I can think of. <br>  Gwyneth Paige--5 I like Paige, but Gwyneth isn't my fav. <br>  Audrey Kathleen--6 It's okay. <br>  Sophia Kate--10 Beautiful!!!!<br>  <br>  I LOVE Sophia Kate!|`|fZGcufB7aa	Paris Elizabeth- I love the name Elizabeth as a first name, but I don't like Paris. It just reminds me of Paris Hilton. Sorry. 3/10<br>  <br>  Gracie Ann- I think that Gracie is really cute, but only for a little girl. Maybe you can name her Grace and call her Gracie. Although Grace Ann doesn't sound good. Maybe Grace Katherine. I love that! 5/10. <br>  <br>  Hannah Marie- I love this name. It is one of my favorites. Hannah is so cute. I do prefer Hannah Makenzie, but it's still really adorable as Hannah Marie. 9/10.<br>   <br>  Cassidy Marie- I like this name too. It is very adorable. You can also call her Cassie which is a very cute nickname. I like the name a lot, but I don't love it. 7/10.<br>  <br>  Harlow Grace- I like Grace, but I don't think Harlow is that great of a name. It sounds really harsh. Maybe you could try Hayley Grace or Harmony Grace. 4/10. <br>  <br>  Taylor Alison- I like this name and I think it flows very well, but the only problem is is that that is Taylor Swift's exact name. Maybe you could try Taylor Marie or Taylor Abigail. 6/10.<br>  <br>  Isabella Renee- I love it! There is absolutely nothing wrong with this name. It is so gorgeous. This is my second favorite name off of your list. You can call her Bella. That is so cute. 10/10.<br>  <br>  Brianna Claire- Adorable! I love the name Brianna and Claire is a great middle name for it. It flows nicely.

If they were long, you can probably wait a bit.  Email me with your length of labor with your previous three and I can get a better idea.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.
kfWi9ZkEaa	Possible but not all that likely.  I wouldn't freak out just yet.  <br>  <br>  Don't recommend it as a form of contraception however: it depends how old the guy is.  If he's young, then 3 seconds is no good.  If he's older, say over 25, then it's probably an alright method, depending on who he is, how reliable he is, whether he knows what he's doing or not.<br>  <br>  As I say, not my recommended form of contraception!|`|p0prrzf2aa	yes there is|`|ZHi6lgnlaa	omg no|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Pre-*** does not normally contain sperm, unless there was a previous ejaculation where he did not urinate after.<br>  So yeah.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Of course there is a possibility of pregnancy.|`|6014e877df433a9c4aa2133e5b670a4faa	Been divorced for 12 years and have three children and just what the hell is sex?|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Yes not safe pre***** come good luck.....|`|pSoebISGaa	She can still get pregnant because some sperm comes out even before he fully 'comes'.

I walked along the walls holding on in case I felt like I was going to fall.  My mom had told me she had the same problem when she was pregnant with brother and I.  A lot of my girlfriends had the same issues.|`|148ee862755853f852478011f94aaf33aa	The pressure you're feeling is the baby dropping down into your pelvis.  This can be uncomfortable, but it means that baby is getting ready to come.  If your back is hurting alot, you may try the following exercise to help reduce back ache associated with a baby thats back is next to your back.  <br>  <br>  Hola Hoop<br>  Stand with your feet shoulder distance apart and move your hips in a big circle as if you were playing with a hola hoop.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you have a beautiful and empowering birth|`|39b10ec7a8ecb41e28e5ac6294a7b423aa	It sounds like your baby has dropped.  This happens close to the time of delivery.  It also coud be that the baby is pushing against your ciatic nerve.  I would call your OB just to inform them especially if the pain is that bad.  Good luck!|`|AA10879127	Every morning i wake up with that feeling... And its cause my son is dropping, and i will feel that way really anytime i get up...

I have countless nights where i wake up from the hip pain. Its all just adjusting for the baby's arrival... Good Luck and hang in there... Your almost there|`|fb8c0dd0229f437dbb908956807ba5deaa	Yes, it felt that way.. When I was pregnant with my last child I felt pain in my back and hips since the 7th month.. I was carrying my belly around to reduce the pain and the pressure on my back. I couldn't walk, sit, sleep, eat or even breathe. I thought I will deliver my baby early, but I didn't have the baby until 2 weeks before my due date. with a "C Section"... I requested it, I couldn't handle the pain and the heavy weight anymore!!<br>  Maybe your baby is getting into the right position now "Crowning", in another words you will be having your baby soon.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA11303527	Yes that's how it feels.  It may feel better if you rock in a rocking chair.  I know that made me feel better, it also felt better when I sat up.  I hurt worst when I walked or layed down.
4c054532ee287767274ad54dcfcb06f3aa	just because you got pounded so hard you bled doesn't mean you won't conceive.<br>  but about the first time...yes, a lot of women bleed...when you lose your virginity, the man breaks a membrane down there..your hymen...and when that breaks, you can bleed.  if you don't wait to heal up a bit before going at it again, you can bleed again.|`|bcca70f6f32b030a89edeebbeb6cc224aa	blood after intercourse means u have broke ur hymen,it doesnt ssures that u r not pregnant,if u have doubt get ur HCG blood test|`|3b74d66033cbe949186c53112c4c2a45aa	It is true that you can blood when it is your first time.  But from my personal experience you can bleed at other times too even if you have intercourse a lot.  It can be because you are close to your period or it can be because of the way you and your partner are doing it.  Take it easy for a while and let your body adjust to all the new things you are putting it thru.  You sound young, so take your time.  Also, even if you bleed you can still conceive.|`|73e2a406c3f5b9cdbe12d2058de5ce50aa	are you due for your period|`|AA11745162	Just because you bleed does not mean that you won't conceive.  You should be fine, but you shouldn't be having unprotected sex. You sound young.

Q3pBRrLpaa	Realmente está bien ubicada la pregunta, sólo un ni?o en edad preescolar preguntaría esa zoncera, porque cualquier ni?o de primaria sabe que Roma es una ciudad.<br>  <br>  t3|`|99f858968e9461960fd02ae7790699b4aa	Roma es una ciudad y es la Capital de Italia...en un Atlas la encontrarás y pudes ver bien dónde está ubicada...|`|n1dR12J2aa	La Ciudad Eterna, con toda razón así también se le llama a Roma. Sabemos que no se les escapa pero de todas formas, ha tratado de decir el nombre de esta ciudad al revés. Por eso y muchas razones más también se le llama la capital del Amor. Muy linda es esta ciudad, y como las otras capitales de Europa, que ya encontraremos el tiempo para ir presentando, es única.<br>  Aunque Roma de por sí tiene todo lo que cualquier otra capital tiene, o puede llegar a desear, ha sido la sede de uno de los sistemas de gobierno más extensos y prolongados que el mundo ha conocido. También es la sede de una de las religiones más admirables de este planeta. Lo cual, sumado al carácter hospitalario y alegre de sus ciudadanos, la hace un destino ideal para los que quisiéramos ver todos los rincones que el camino se reserva.<br>  Los romanos son simpáticos porque aunque son sumamente cultos, son también sumamente impulsivos y alegres, lo cual es la fórmula perfecta para hacer cualquier cosa.

YQ3ZWhmeaa	I had the same thing happen with my last one. I got up out of bed and I had the same pop. I could have even swore that I heard it. It turned out that my baby had just dropped. It won't be long now. Congrats.|`|AA10135406	did your water break?|`|3dBbig0laa	Don't ask Yahoo!, ask  your Ob/Gyn|`|CUzOmRt9aa	it is totally normal and most doctors warn women that this will happen. It is part of your body and the baby getting ready for delivery. Unless you are having contractions in regular intervals and increasing intensity or notice blood or leakage in your underpants just take it easy because your are getting near your day. Also don't forget to count the baby's movements every couple of hours during the day.|`|UaKeW6bCaa	Um hon havent you called your doctor yet?  That doesnt sound normal to me..sorry!|`|bdf6e7ac2a3dc40e761a056b523d34cdaa	I would definitely call the dr.  It could be the baby has just got itself in it's final position for birth.  Watch for leakage, plug or a lot of abnormal discharge.  Good luck.|`|a53a47c4a35effe15490cddb5439896aaa	I would call dr just to keep them informed since you are so close to delivery.  If you have had any leakage of fluid or mucus, you should definitely call.  It might be time!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|f5ZIohyLaa	The baby's head may have dropped? I would call your doctor if you are having any pain.
3AVtTd33aa	It really depends on how fast your baby grows.<br>  <br>  <br>  But get ready when those little teeth start cutting through she wont want to be anywhere but with her mommy.|`|kwBslJvDaa	I was wondering the same thing. 2 days ago I saw a huge bump in my sons mouth. It was red with some white. Yesterday morning I felt it and I could feel a little bit of the tooth coming through. This is his very first tooth and he is miserable. I was told it would only take a few days for the rest of it to come through. It this true?|`|94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	it depends on the baby. Don't use anbesol etc..it makes the gums harder to cut through. If she has problems get her Hylands teething tablets they work wonders.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	It really just varies. Its different with every baby.<br>  <br>  When my Daughter was 2 months old, she started showing signs of teething. After about a month they finally broke through her gums.<br>  <br>  Give it a little longer, they will just appear one day!
a7pgX1W8aa	When my older son was a baby he had a similar problem. When he threw up it was like the exorcist and I didn't know what to do either with formula. My pediatrician also said he had acid reflux, but I didn't know how that was possible, I mean he only a baby. Then I found out that a lot of doctors try to diagnose babies that throw up with acid reflux. I just didn't want to give him medicine for that, unless it was absolutely necessary. So I tried something different. When I was pregnant with him I was going to the Chiropractor because my back was killing me and it helped me. So I went to my Chiropractor and told him what was going on and he said he could help him stop throwing up so much. He said there is some kind of bone in his spine that is pushing on his stomach and it makes him throw up. After the first 2 visits he wasn't throwing up anymore, just maybe a little spit up, and after a one or two more visits he wasn't even doing that anymore. Then all I had to do is take him in about every two weeks for a little bit or sooner if he started to spit up again and it cleared him right up.<br>  <br>  I have had 2 other kids since him and I take took them to the Chiropractor for just spit up (thank god not more exorcist throw up with them) and they are doing great.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds kinda strange, but it really does work and you may not have to give your child meds anymore. Try it. Hope this helps.|`|QXREldcEaa	If he has no other signs besides spitting up then it might just be reflux.  But usually they say to keep them on one formula for 2 weeks to see if the symptoms improve.  So I'd wait at least another week.  Wanted to add you should try the meds and see if that improves the spitting up at all - you might be surprised the symptoms will disappear!
gPg7qYGIaa	i don't really understand what your asking but adoptive parents have same rights as a normal mum or dad
TIqFAXo1aa	try a pacifier- babys want to suck - sometimes even when they are not hungry|`|pXSKSS3daa	He's probably going through a growth spurt. Two hours, at 3 weeks old, is a long time for your baby. Just feed on demand and you'll probably see this pass without a week or two.|`|gRtmFa1maa	Its a growth spurt and he's right on time. Babies will increase the frequency of their feedings because their demand has gone up. This increased frequency signals your body to make more. In a few days, your breasts will start to produce more milk and he'll get more per feeding...then he'll be back onto a regular schedule and eating less frequently.<br>  <br>  I think the next typical growth spurt is at 2-3 months.|`|AA10836047	Babies go through growth spurts...and can do this every couple of weeks..(i forget how long it goes on for..it's been 6 yrs since i had a newborn) it may seem like they never stop eating. He won't eat if he's not hungry... just offer it to him whenever he's rooting. He knows who his mommy is... he knows your smell... just feed on demand....you are not just  a milk machine.|`|u9sGH0AXaa	Sounds like a growth spurt.  Don't worry, it will pass in a few days.  Wow, it seems like yesterday I was asking the same questions about my now 12 week old!  Enjoy your time, even if the are stuck to your breasts! :)|`|X6as2nOAaa	It might be a growth spurt I would just feed him when he wants to eat no matter how often it is.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	I know your tired, but this is what breastfeeding is. It does get better. Just remember, when he was in the womb he had constant nourishment. Now he is out and has to wait to eat. He wants to eat every time he is with you because he is making the association that when he is with you, he gets milk. He loves you and may just want the comfort of skin to skin contact. And there is nothing wrong with that! It's a good thing. Feed him on demand. Do not schedule his feedings. It will mess with your supply and then you will be wondering how to increase your supply. Congratulations and good luck! It does get easier. This just sounds like a growth spurt.|`|OGdD2bO8aa	Its completely normal for a 3 week old because its a growth spurt so he's feeding in clusters. It'll just increase your milk supply for him. It'll happen again at 6 weeks (I'm there now) then 3 months and so on. It may help if you pump also. Since he gaining weight and having the right amount of dirty diapers you're doing a great job :)|`|dRKGXQmeaa	I'm still a milk machine for my 6 week old. He's probably going through a growth spurt and trying to build your milk supply up more. Keep in mind babies also love to comfort suck, and if he can get milk to put on weight while only intending to use the boob as comfort, even better! That's how I look at it so I don't ever feel tempted to use a pacifier. He should slow down with the constant feedings around 2 months old if he doesn't before then. He'll get even better at extracting milk from your breasts and will be able to get himself fuller more quickly. If you need a break you can always pump in between feedings for a few days to stock up on expressed milk and then get others to bottle feed him for a few hours here and there to give you a rest. I've started doing this and it makes a HUGE difference in just being able to get up and do things like cleaning. You will still need to pump, though, when others are feeding him, in order to maintain your milk supply.
AA11315360	Dont do that. They will if you want but you might regret it later and it is hard to reverse.<br>  I suggest the IUC called MIRENA (www.mirena.com). Look into that. It is more effective than tying tubes and birth control pills!<br>  I suggest you use that. It is designed for women who have had kids already and dont want any but dont want surgery. It lasts for 5 years after it is put in by an OBGYN. Ask about mirena.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Lol thats what my friends mom thought she wanted to is no more kids since shes already had 3 but then many years down the road later she met a new guy and decided she wants to have a baby with him so she went and had her tubes untied and now shes trying to get pregnant again but its a 70% chance that it will happen.|`|aohKqXraaa	It depends upon the doctor.. most doctor's won't do it at that young of an age because they're afraid you'll change your mind and want more kids later in life.  All you have to do is ask though.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Well considering you are pregnant at the moment you will be 19 when and if they do it. You will have to be really really sure you do not want anymore children and you will have to convince the doctor but I spose you could always ask. The fact that you have two children already he might do it.|`|DQPYoMg1aa	Very difficult at your young age, doctors usually refuse to do this, other than for medical reasons, until you are 30 or so.|`|cyTlkoAYaa	If you ask the doctor then he/she will do it if you want.

Do not let your doc brush you off, you need to be able to have something to help you with your fears.

I just started laying her in her crib during nap time.  so I'm going to slowly introduce her to her crib with nap times.  Best wishes|`|2pxiK9waaa	Simple: take out the seat and let him cry. It'll take a few nights of crying, but I guarantee that within a week he will be sleeping just fine.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I guess you will just need to wait until he is just a tiny bit older and try to reason with him!|`|q3DtwCilaa	Try an inclining bed or something that he can sit up in.|`|zPPYGv7Daa	Imagine someone taking your pillow away that you have been sleeping with forever.  It will take time to what he is use to doing but just do it. <br>  And hide the car seat so he doesn't see it.  Maybe buy a new stuffed animal for him to sleep with.  He will cry alot but at least he is still in a crib confined so he doesn't coming running to you.  Leave and every 3 min go in, pat him, lay him down, tell him it's ok.   It will take about a week, but don't give in once or your doomed.  Get morral support while you do this.  It is hard to hear your child cry. Make sure he is really tired when you put him down.  Good Luck!|`|WJjfrf0Caa	he doesn't need the actual car seat, he needs the position. <br>  try creating the same position with pillows. <br>  so basically you create a car seat out of pillows inside of the crib. do this for about a week and then remove 1 pillow so that the angle of lower. keep lowering the "seat" over a period of time and your child will adjust slowly with the changes.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Is it possible he's still uncomfortable sleeping flat? Try putting something under the head end of his mattress so he's still sleeping at an angle - or just give him a pillow, he's old enough for it to be safe.<br>  <br>  But I'm afraid you may simply have to remove the car seat and have a couple of sleepless nights. He will sleep eventually.
5jqfKDdfaa	I couldnt agree with you more...<br>  I dont want to be married (long term relationship maybe, but i dont have to say vows to show someone i love them) and the thought of having kids repulses me....so what was i supposed to do...stay celibate for the rest of my existence? No...thats stupid and its especially stupid (and rude) when people try to push their beliefs onto me.|`|9zwSclnLaa	They have an opinion.  Just as you are intitled to yours, they are intitled to theirs.  You may not agree with this opinion but it is silly to put others down over the computer for this.  Internet fights are stupid.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	because they think everyone intends to get married<br>  when not everyone does|`|jTAWyIzqaa	I wonder if any of the 'people' your talking about has heard of 'religon'? Its all in how you were raised and what you have came to believe. A girl who has been brought up with loving parents that graduated high school, went to college, got married and then had children are more likely to grow up wanting the same. As opposed to a girl that has been a free lancer and no rules applied would. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and jurisdiction. Get married then have kids. Vice versa. Have a kid with your bf and then he dont want a thing to do with it. Your stuck with a kid and no partner. When your exposed to marrige before children sometimes your conscience gets in the way and weighs hard on your decision on how you should plan out your own. If you end up having a child before your married you tend to wonder before celebrating the gift of life. Im not saying I'm negative toward marrige before children. But Im also not for it either. Hope this has helped.|`|uJFXbHA7aa	Primarily, those who correlate marriage with sex have a faith-based reason for their answer.<br>  <br>  You know, its only for procreation or it is only for monogamous couples.<br>  <br>  I tend to think that someone should wait until they are an adult and/or  mature enough to to thoughfully deal with the consequences of sex.|`|zsx4L2Hhaa	i just think that you might regret later who you sleep with if he turns out to be a scumbag or totally disses you the next day after you sleep with him.<br>  plus, if you get pregnant at like 13 or even 16, it screws up your future of going to college or just living a normal teenage life.<br>  even if you decide to get an abortion (which i think is TOTALLY wrong), you can have medical problems that stay with you for the rest of your life...<br>  basically, i just think it's easier not to have sex.<br>  <br>  =)|`|wqRwSaGSaa	im not a virgin, and i honestly dont believe in having sex with just one person.<br>  one person at a time yes, im not a slut iv only slept with 2.<br>  but i think you need to first one, where your exsperimenting.<br>  and then the second one.<br>  well the second one winds up to be my fiance and even tho hes my 2nd im his 19th.<br>  we did go to a clinic and both get blood test before having sex.<br>  and if your on bc.  i think its fine.|`|giyyEv3Aaa	sex brings you closer. its really important in a relationship when you get serious to be honest, it gets you a step further through the relationship. I agree with you tho, some people who don't wanna get married still wanna have some action too you know? haha, is it so wrong? [=|`|tBtOTiQDaa	because its in my religion<br>  sex is something special<br>  something meant for married couples<br>  i don't care if you don't wait<br>  but, i did wait, and im proud of it|`|113FoyMFaa	I agree.<br>  <br>  People seem to think that if you're married, the father can't run off.  Or that it's a more stable environment.  pfffft.  those people have obviously never been married.|`|AA11296427	It's stupid. Everyone has an opinion, and not everyone sees sex in the same way.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|x08oohwpaa	I'm 25 and I live with my boyfriend, we don't intend on getting married, obviously we have sex.  I think you should wait until you are ready, knowledgeable and safe.  I wish I would have waited longer than I did but not for any religious reason.  You only get one body, take care of it and be responsible, don't dwell on what other people think is right.  <br>  <br>  (Many of my religious friends got married right out of high school, I think cause they wanted to have sex.  None of those marriages lasted.  So if you wait for marriage you should also wait until your responsible enough to get married. )|`|eJfCDnABaa	i no right im 17 and im not a Virgin. and ya ppl did tell me to wait until i got married but hey i cant wait that long.|`|HcvqGMZraa	I totally agree because I know people who do that i just think if You do and your not married it should be someone special.|`|FJFO0GPxaa	It is a personal choice.<br>  Not everyone is going to wait that long and only you know what is best for you. <br>  Most people say to wait until you are married because if you get pregnant it wont be as hard to support the baby and such. <br>  <br>  But like I said.. its a pesonal choice.<br>  And if you are asking this because you are a young girl thinking about having sex think about everything.<br>  -Is your partner/bf using you?<br>  -Would he stick around for the long run?<br>  -Are you in the position to love and care and provide for a baby?<br>  -Are you emotionaly and physically ready for sex?<br>  -Are you sure this is right timing?<br>  etc.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I agree, I dont see the big deal with marriage, thats more of a religious thing and some people are just not religious and some just plain dont want to get marriage, its only a piece of paper after all. It should not matter if they are married or not if they are in a committed relationship, and i see married woman and men on here asking about abortion because they had an unplanned pregnancy. You can have an unplanned pregnancy weather you are married or not.|`|MCeh0uIaaa	I could not agree with you more. I don't have a problem with people who wait for marriage; I completely respect them and all that jazz. It's mostly a religious thing. Some people think God will think more of them if they wait but everyone is supposedly equal in his eyes & why would you want to spend your entire life trying to please someone anyways? I'm catholic so I guess I should practice abstenence but it's just not for me.t's not for everyone.<br>  <br>  EDIT again: I got 2 thumbs down before I even edited this from "h/o I have to edit but I agree with you." I don;t give people thumbs down for what they believe in. People are so close minded...

cY8DgJv5aa	Wrong section sweetpea.  You are wanting the pet section.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you don't already know how to care for a puppy, then you don't need to be getting one.  You need to know what you are doing BEFORE you bring the pup home.  Go to the library and pick up some books so that you can educate yourself.  <br>  <br>  And I know you said you don't want to hear it, but there really isn't any reason why you should be bringing the puppy to your home prior to 7 or 8 weeks of age.  Especially since you have no idea what you are doing.  Anything sooner than that could and most likely will cause problems with the pup.  There are important things that a puppy learns from their mother and litter mates during those weeks.  You are setting yourself (and the poor dog) up for a very rough start by taking them away from their mother that early.  If its impossible for them to be with other dogs, then the puppy needs to stay with someone who knows what they are doing.  They need to be bottle fed and introduced to the appropriate foods at the appropriate time.  You obviously aren't the experienced owner that this puppy needs right now.|`|cFhgBmTuaa	you can usually bottle feed them baby food til they can eat

be1B2Cf9aa	Boys:<br>  Noah Lennox- I have a very lenient opinion on middle names. I think that since a child will not likely be teased for their middle name a parent can have as much fun as they want in that slot. I once knew a girl with 15 middle names...That was a bit excessive but you get the picture. That being said I enjoy that you have placed a nice familiar but not too common name in the first name slot and had a little fun with the second name.It flows nicely. 8/10.<br>  Aiden Hart- I have never liked any of the -aiden names. However, Aiden is my favorite spelling of in my opinion the most tolerable of the -aiden names. It also sounds nice with Hart. 7/10.<br>  Braxton Avery- I don't enjoy the name Braxton. Reminds me of Toni braxton who I have never particularly liked. However, I love Avery, and it does flow well. 5/10.<br>  Jackson Ryder- Sorry, while this flows you have combined two of my least favorite names. I like Jack Ryder though. 4/10.<br>  Landon Parker- Landon is another one of my personal no's. However I have taken a shine to this combination. 6/10<br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  Isabella Breanne- This is the best flow I have seen so far on your list. It is a truly beautiful name. 9/10.<br>  Ava Manelle- Again I appreciate that Manelle is fun and unique but not on the front display. Ava is pretty though I have always preferred Eva. 7/10.<br>  Chloe Sophia- Very cute. Are you going to spell it with the accent marks? I always thought they gave this name more character. 6/10.<br>  Alyssa Reagan- I can't say I enjoy this flow, the names are nice though. 4/10.<br>  Rowan Olivia- Very pretty. 7/10.|`|brVS3Pg0aa	I think some of them like manelle and rowan are a little strange, but other than that i love the creativity and uniqueness.

pXSKSS3daa	*Raises hand*<br>  <br>  Sorry!! Lol. Noah started sleeping through the night at around 8 weeks(9 PM-5 AM). Now, at 10 and a half months old he sleeps 11-13 hours/night.<br>  <br>  I honestly don't know how it happened. I wasn't expecting him to start it as young as he did, but it was nice. And we didn't really start a routine until he was 4 months, which by then he had been sleeping through the night consistently. I have found, though, if we stray from his routine or he misses out on one of his naps he's a bit harder to put down and will sometimes wake.<br>  <br>  What's normal for your son(not sleeping through) may not be normal for others. I know the saying is like beating a dead horse but all babies are different. Some just take longer to sleep through the night than others. I would try a nightly routine, though, if you haven't established one.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Around 6 months my son was sleeping through maybe 2-3 nights a week.<br>  <br>  Then, around 7 months we had a glorious month of him sleeping through every night!<br>  <br>  Then we hit where we are now, with 2 teeth coming in and a cold, so he's back up again.<br>  <br>  I was prepared for at least one overnight feeding until 9 months.  Still am, it looks like.<br>  <br>  I did a fair amount of reading up on sleep and some tweaking of his schedule.  I am a big fan of "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child."<br>  <br>  However, honestly, he just did it when he was ready.|`|X6as2nOAaa	My baby has been off and on since she was 2 months old some days she will and some days she won't.

Half the time I don't believe them. That is just me though.

I got laid off on Friday though, so now I don't think I'll mind as much that he wakes up.|`|oF2kOKlnaa	Not to worry - every baby is different.  My son is six months old and has done about six hours straight I think three times.  Other than that we are lucky to get four hours at a time.  The last few nights he has woken every two or three hours as I think he is going through teething, developmental stages and separation anxiety all at the same time the poor little sausage.  He starts off in his own bed and then comes to us as he is inconsolable sometimes and for the sanity of all of us I bring him to us and he sleeps better.<br>  <br>  Don't worry that some very very lucky mothers have babies sleeping through but I think you will find, as lucky as they are, some of them (not all)  will have OTHER issues to deal with that you do not and they probably think you are lucky!  :-)<br>  <br>  Good luck from one sleep deprived mummy to another.|`|rFtKFp03aa	I have 9 month old triplets who have been sleeping through the night since 4 months.... <br>  <br>  The month before that they would sleep from 700pm to 500am and then go back to sleep for 2 more hours after that feeding... <br>  <br>  Finally they went 7 - 7 <br>  <br>  I know lots of women in my mothers of multiples groups (50%) that either got their babies to sleep through the night by following that book Baby Wise, they all rave about it.

I actually ended up waking her up at 10 because I was so scared (I knew she was breathing but I was still nervous).  Now she is 6 months and sleeps from 10pm-10am.  She wakes up around 8:30 and I take her into my bed and she sleeps with me until 10.  <br>  I've been doing the same routine from the first month.  I give her a massage each night with Johnson and Johnson lotion, which helps her relax after a bath.  I read 2 stories, sing songs and nurse her.

So all in all she sleeps around 12-13 hrs at night.  She has around 2 or 3 naps during the day lasting anywhere from 20min. - 1hr. each.  <br>  <br>  Oh and she is now 7 months (as of yesterday!).  But I'm not "counting my chickens before they hatch" just yet lol.  She doesn't have any teeth so I don't know what that process will be like for her - she may have me up all night when that happens!  <br>  <br>  I never tried to put her to bed, she always would just fall asleep and stay that way till morning.  I still do that.  Have you tried doing baths at night and maybe using some calming lavender baby lotion afterwards?  Just a suggestion...... =)  I do feel for you though, I would be going nuts if I was still having to get up every 3 hours!  Good luck and I hope he starts sleeping through soon!|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Colten started sleeping through the night at 3 weeks old. He goes down at know particular set time, usually around 830-ish and sleeps until about 630am-ish. Which is fine because we are early birds anyways.<br>  <br>  We didnt do anything special, he just one day decided he didnt want to wake up to eat, he would just rather wait until the morning time.<br>  <br>  Don't worry :) he will eventually sleep through, I know way older babies that still don't sleep through the night.|`|50lIaC8zaa	My daughter is 9 months old and she doesn't sleep through the night (well not what i would call sleeping through anyway). She will wake or half wake anywhere from 2 - 5 times a night, not for a feed but for her dummy if its fallen out or just to babble to herself. I think some babies just naturally wake more at night than others the same as adults, im sure some adults wake a few times in the night. My 6 year old was another matter she slept through the night from 6 weeks!!|`|LbkLg4RFaa	I got really lucky and my son slept through the night at about 6 weeks old.  The only thing we did was a bedtime routine.  Honestly I think it was just luck and the fact that even when he was 6 weeks old he wouldn't sleep more than 1 1/2 hours between 6am -6pm no matter what I did.  Of course there are weeks were he will wake up 1-2 times a night.|`|yCwPxulYaa	My daughter started STTN at 8 weeks old.  She was sleeping 7-9 hours straight a night.<br>  <br>  She hit 4 months and started waking again (1,2, or 3 times depending on her mood)<br>  <br>  Now at almost 6 months, she usually sleeps 5 hours, nurses, and then sleeps another 5 hours.  So I guess she is sleeping pretty good now, but still not STTN.  Sometimes, like last night, she will wake up twice.|`|UghJ0XROaa	My two year did until we put her in a toddler bed, now she pays nighttime visits to us quite frequently. She was sleeping through the night at 2 months for 12 hours a night. <br>  <br>  My four month old still wakes up 2-3 times a night, now combined with our nighttime toddler visits, some nights are sleepless.|`|KmC0K59taa	Mine didn't until 9 months.  She is now 22 months and goes through spells where she wakes up every night for weeks.<br>  <br>  Lots of moms put cereal in the bedtime bottle, but I never did that.  They claim that gets them to sleep real fast.  <br>  <br>  I felt like I got a lot less sleep than I needed for the whole first year.  Good luck!|`|OHq5gSjJaa	I've often wondered this same question...  <br>  <br>  My eight month old still wakes up once a night.  And only sleeps for 9 hours a night total, not the 12 hours most parents seem to get.  Sigh.  I'm patiently waiting.|`|46tTmMT7aa	Never! My daughter is 19months and still occasionally gets up throughout the night for various reasons; diaper change, milk, occasiaonally food, for a cuddle.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my daughter is 14 months and only just started sleeping through completely! please dont feel left out...i bet half the parents dont include the resltless teething nights or when babies lost there paci in the dark:)|`|DNygQdmVaa	My son is 14 months old and starting sleeping through the noght when he was about 10 months old,<br>  I don think many 5 month olds are sleeping throught he night, i know mine didnt!|`|7RhXX7qfaa	Sorry my son started sleeping through the night at two weeks, 11pm-7am I thought it was a fluke but he has done it ever since (with the exception of him being ill) I have no I idea why he just got himself into it and I wasn't going to wake him even though my HV told me too, he is 7mths now and sleeps from 7.30pm till about 6.30 ish. but he still sleeps in his cot right next to mummy so if he wakes up he knows I'm there and goes straight back to sleep.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Well my son does "sleep through the night" just not necessarily at the hours I would like all the time.  He's 4 1/2 months old and sleeps anywhere from 6-8 hours at stretch. He started sleeping 6 solid hours a night at 3months. I didn't do anything, he started it all on his own so I have no secrets to share. Sometimes his 6-8 hour stretch of sleep starts at 3am and sometimes at 6pm. I never know when it's going to be! I'm hoping to try to get him into a better sleep pattern as he grows. Right now he's getting to the teething phase so all bets are off until the worst of that is over.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	My son has slept through the night on and off since he was few weeks old. Now he totally sleeps through with no night feeds. Not by my choice but his. He seems not want to be bothered with eating at night lol. Until he started getting or cutting his teeth. Then his whole routine went out the window. Well a lot of his routine was messed up when back in nov( my husbands bro died and we had zillions of family around) and they all wanted to hold him. We were at his grandmas alot more almost all day..when naps were needed and would stay till 9 pm and that through our bed time routine. He used to go to bed before 8 to 9pm and not wake till 7 am and then take 2 naps a day. Now we have to do almost everything under the sun to get him in bed by 11. It really depends on what Jeffrey wants to do lol. See alot of this is bc My son is usually just used to My husband and I or me during the day and the quietness. But tonight he didn't put up no fight and has been asleep since 9:30ish.|`|iwtetdBoaa	my 1st baby would never sleep allnight till she was 8 months old  it was hard but now shes 3 & half  and sleeps allnite  now my son he was a good sleeper and he is now 13 months old  now my new baby girl who is 2 weeks old is sleeping pretty good i would say  i get atleast 5 hours at nite and maybe 2 in the day time,  it want me long mom hang in there  ( if i did it anyone can do it  my first i mean  she was a hand full  till about 1 yrs old lol)<br>  <br>  mom 3 & half yr old daughter <br>  13 month old son<br>  and 2 week old baby girl :)<br>  all (3) kids all under  3 & half- i get no help *hubby* is a full time worker - works nites and some days   and my fam and n laws all live out of state-|`|jYPeis3Saa	my son started sleeping thorugh the night at 2 1/2months old. <br>  he did great up until he had major reconstructive surgery at 8 months requiring a 6 day hospital stay where the nurses would wake him every hour on the hour to do htings like take vitals, and change his diaper. so when we got home his sleeping all went to hell. its finally starting to get better. he pretty much sleeps through the night, but naps are still a struggle. <br>  <br>  he'll be 16 months on the 26th. <br>  <br>  every baby is different, and there is no required time or stage when they are "supposed" to sleep through.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	I know exactly how you feel. But dont let other people make you feel bad. Some babies just take longer to sleep through the night. Each baby is an individual with individual needs. There is no rule each baby has to follow. If your son still needs to wake for feedings then thats fine. He will eventually get out of it one day.<br>  My daughter will be 9 months old this week and she still wakes for a feed once a night. I feel quite depressed too when people with much younger babies are bragging about how they sleep through the night. I have felt guilt over this and wondered what i am doing wrong. But I have come to the conclusion that I am doing nothing wrong. And my daughter isnt doing anything wrong either. Its not her fault she still feels hungry at 4 in the mornings. She will get over it when she is ready. Until then I am doing my job as a mother and responding to her needs. Good luck|`|a68ffe49e2de6255f0c67a8c0b9c6f60aa	I so know how you feel, you get so sick of people saying my kid was sleeping through the night at 1 week your should be sleeping through the night by now, Calebs almost 7 months and still hasnt slept through the night and i dont really expect him to either for awhile, i guess theyyll get there eventually.:)|`|18e6c6ba7e558bb945b46902f7a5f9fbaa	Hi my daughter slept through the night since she was 3 days old and still does and she will be 2 in April from 8pm to 8am<br>  it took 3 days for my breast milk to come through and ever since that came through shes been like that<br>  <br>  PS IM not telling you that your baby should be sleeping through as i know not every child is the same maybe my next child wont sleep through and maybe your will next time|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I have a 5yr old, 3yr old and nearly 2 yr old. I think we have about 1 night a month or less, where all 3 children sleep all night LOL!<br>  <br>  The 3 yr old particularly has not ever slept well. He gets scared in the dark as he has poor eye sight.<br>  <br>  The 2 yr old is the worst at the moment, but has teeth coming through the gums.|`|63bxt86taa	He'll be 4 months on the 26th and is a very good sleeper, always has been, he sleeps roughly 7-8 hours  night. BUT he still sleeps beside me in a crib at night and beside me in a moses basket in the day.....maybe when he has to take naps/sleep by himself thats when the problems will start. lol.|`|etwhvalhaa	i feel the same only my son is 14 months old!! he has slept rhu before but its never lasted longer than a few days and he hasnt done it for months! he now goes to bed about 8, wakes at 12 for milk or juice, thensometime between 4 and 6 for milk or juice then bk to sleep til 7.30. my grandma who has 5 kids assures me hers were all the same. but ive got friends whos babies slept trhu from 10 weeks!!! its so annoying!|`|V6slDthdaa	My daughter is 14 months and STILL doesn't consistently sleep throught the night. Every now and then she will, maybe twice a week or so. Usually she wakes once to eat. I guess it's just the luck of the draw.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	My son was in the NICU for 23 days after he was born. He didn't come home sleeping through the night. But he started sleeping through the night at about 3 months old, because I would keep him up during the day.|`|w3ob12X6aa	well my daughter is 3 months old and she sleeps from like 10pm till around 6am and then feeds for like 10 mintues and goes back to sleep till around 9am.|`|q8tUfflyaa	my daughter is 3 months almost and sleeps from 9 pm-6 am.. she just started doing this 2 weeks ago|`|BUXC2Kz0aa	Sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeping thru WOTS that LOL.....I'm with you on this one, I often think mums just say their lo sleepin thru just to bug me lol!!! Don't think my lo who is now 7 1/2mths will ever sleep thru the night...He's the same and I feel oh so lucky when he manages 4 hours!! I met up with some friends yesterday...one of them has a lil girl 4wks younger than my lo and she has supposedly slept thru since 6wks of age ...my other friends lil girl has only just started too and she's just turned 1!!!  So we'll have to set up a NO SLEEP WEBSITE lol :-0|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	It is not just your baby! Every baby is different! My son was a wonderful baby! He slept through the night (about 8 hours) when he was 2 weeks old! I thought "wow, this is easy! Lets have another!". So I had my daughter when my son was only 19 months old, and she didn't sleep AT ALL for 4 months! Not through the night, not at all. we were up All night long (and most of the day!). She did not start sleeping through the night completely until after she was over a year!<br>  It is not anything you can do, it is just the baby. He will sleep through the night when he is ready. Here are some things you Can do though. When he wakes up, let him lay there for 10 minutes or so before you go get him. He might not really be hungry, and there is a chance he might go back to sleep on his own. It also helps him get a little more independent!<br>  Good Luck!

tzPEckiZaa	She's 16 and in college??|`|bS7DN85Qaa	She could have Borderline Personality Disorder, characterised by low self-esteem and the view that you're just not that special and you can abuse your body because it isn't worth it. Look it up and send her to a shrink.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	I agree with the third poster. It sounds a lot like borderline personality disorder. Or else Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. That's what I thought while reading this. I think you should really talk to her. She needs help and fast. This could really damage her if it hasn't already.|`|oS28Pf3iaa	wow. first i think it is fantastic that you are friends with her because most girls would be to scared... exedera. anyways... she needs help.. no other way to put ino oneone can go through all that stuff and still mentallyaly stable.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	This almost doesn't seek true!

And shes had a messed up life, most people have messed up lifes, but since hers started in childhood she should have had therapy, because this is sadly what happens to alot of girls with really bad chilhoods.

Good luck on your journey!! :)|`|VwtkgIA2aa	All you can do is sit her down and tell her that you're worried about her. If she doesn't want to listen, it's her fault. Just explain to her why you are so worried. You sound like a great friend though and she should appreciate that you really care for her.|`|QNnRVUoiaa	wow ! none of this is normal. she needs some serious help. this friend needs a counsellor, maybe a doctor, a psychologist. and treatment i guess.|`|76G2VhJ6aa	no that is not normal what she needs is a friend thats close to her.

As long as he is still getting most of his nutrition from breastmilk or formula, he will be fine.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	He's ready for real food. Ditch the commercial gloop and give him finger food size pieces of what your  family eats. Have you ever tasted rice cereal and baby jars? I wouldn't want it either.<br>  <br>  If what your family eats isn't suitable for an 8 month old, it isn't suitable for you either.|`|46tTmMT7aa	At that age he is fully ready to be on table foods. Let him try whatever you are eating at dinner tonight and see how he does, more than likely he will love it!|`|TuIrAXLkaa	I had the same problem. I had to go as far as to put the gummy candies that they sell in the baby food section with vitamins c and all that good stuff.

I'm sorry, it reminds me of Bruce Willlis' daughter.It will be the butt of every joke like her.I think Jessica is overused as well.I prefer Jennica these days.|`|dVzPKGGiaa	that is very unique. if you want other ideas what about emily grace or emma grace?|`|AA11273571	Only cute if your mom is Demi Moore and your dad is Bruce Willis.|`|CURZ8bOzaa	Sorry, I don't particularly like that name....it isn't feminine at all. Your kid might get picked on. :(|`|jb86k8BRaa	I have mixed feelings about the name "Rumer" and other names that are various or exact spellings of nouns in the English language, some are nice and some come off as a little much, like "Seven" and "Pilot Inspektor" (yes these are real names celebrities have chosen for their children) and "Rumer" is Bruce Willis' daughter's name as well<br>  <br>  bottomline: It's definitely unique, I like it, not everybody will, but who cares? I'm all for being different and standing out...|`|EqjnDZoEaa	its cute, but it might sound like rumer as in a rumor, so i dont know, try someting unusual but common like: beatrice (bea) Bridget, Judith(jude/judy) kelly, jennifer, colleen,addison(addie/addy) etc<br>  hope i helped|`|miOor5SRaa	I must agree i dont really like that name either...Kids can be cuel it will get her picked on!

YMoBKBjtaa	I LOVE LOVE LOVE Kylie Jade!!!!! That's beautiful!! Cheyenne Claire is also really nice. I would love Skylar Jade - that's just stunning!!!! And I would prefer the second one spelled Aubriana... this way it will get pronounced correctly and I just think it looks more beautiful and complete. Aubriana Claire is beautiful!!! I'm not too big of a fan of the name Aria. Ariel or Arielle is really pretty, though!! Or Arianna / Ariana... I LOVE that!!!! For a boy, I LOVE Jayden James!!!!! That's just lovely. Awesome, awesome choice. Ryan James would also be beautiful!! Preston James is great. I'm not too big of a fan of Dominic James, but there is a pretty nice flow. Hope this helped great names!! Best wishes =)|`|7drjpohUaa	I like Aria Claire the most. I like Skyla Jade, but I'd like it better as Skylar Jade.<br>  Out of the boy's names, I like a lot of them. Preston James is my favorite, as is Jayden James and Rylen James. <br>  <br>  Since you like Preston for a boy, maybe you'd like Presley for a girl?|`|8OoqHpbIaa	Skyla Jade  ( my name is sky loved growing up with this name)<br>  Cheyenne Cliare ( my daughters name is Shyanne !!) love it<br>  Aria ( was going to use this name for my next one but its  a porn star!!)<br>  <br>  <br>  love Preston and Jayden<br>  <br>  Great names|`|hVrfm4eIaa	Aria Claire & Rylan James - both are great names|`|9cMglDUUaa	abriana Claire<br>  Jayden Troy|`|1xWcQwpBaa	Kylie Belle<br>  <br>  James Troy|`|HBgnkltfaa	My favorite from the girls' list is Aria Claire.  It's sweet and cute, but it seem like it would age better than the others.  Abriana Claire would be my second choice.  Skyla, Kylie, Jade, and Cheyenne all feel very trendy.  They're cute now, but I'm afraid they'll sound dated in a few years.  Instead of the hyphenated Aria-Belle, you might consider Arielle, Arabelle, or Arabella.<br>  <br>  On the boys' list, I like Dominic James the best.  It feels less trendy than the others and a bit more substantial.  I also like Preston.  Rylen isn't bad, though Ryland feels like a stronger name -- Rylen blends in with Ryan and Riley, but Ryland is more distinctive.  The only name on the boys' list I'd recommend avoiding is Jayden/Jaeden.  It's very trendy and common.  You have some great less common options on your list, so there's no need to choose the name everyone else is choosing.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope this helps!|`|gl4DFLVGaa	Rylen James for a boy<br>  <br>  <br>  For a girl I would take Kylie and put it with Claire.

2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	how old is she? if she's past six weeks, i'd just put her back in the crib after a change, nursing and few minutes of cuddles (obviously if she starts screaming and crying if you do this... it may not be condusive to getting her to sleep). try a crib soother or a some music<br>  <br>  i hate to tell you... some would consider 10-3 sleeping through the night (its more than 5 hours... and i don't agree that 5 hours is through the night). my son is 6 months old and sleeps 8-3 then wakes for the day at 6am, some don't stop til after a year (when weaned from nursing and bottles) some not til well after that.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	How old is she?|`|46tTmMT7aa	It's unrealistic to think your baby will ever sleep through the night. My daughter is 19 months and will still occasionally wake up during the night for various reasons.
IuzaNq2Uaa	I did bring up the top 100 names in your state, and Angel is the 3rd most popular boy's name there. I feel that if they can cope with Angel on a boy (a male but not really butch name) then maybe Aubrey isn't that much of a stretch?<br>  <br>  California also has a couple of "old-fashioned' names like Edgar which seem to have skyrocketed from the bottom of the top 1000 into the top 100 in a year, so it seems open to accepting older-style names.<br>  <br>  As well as Aubrey Huff the baseball player, there is also Aubrey Drake - a Canadian actor and rapper. <br>  <br>  I think you know best how it will go down in your home town; you're a teacher and must have a bit of a feel for what range of names are "acceptable" there.<br>  <br>  Personally I've never thought of Aubrey as a feminine name, and was quite shocked to see that people are using it for girls now. I know that it looks similar to Audrey, but Josie looks similar to José as well and surely that doesn't mean José is a girl's name?|`|hcqNXUH5aa	I think it's another boy's name that has been taken over by girls...  It's unfortunate when this happens.  And so, I'd probably stay clear of it.  I think a boy would be mortified to have a "girl's" name (even if it was originally a boy's name- he would still be surrounded while growing-up by female Aubreys.    <br>  <br>  Although, the name itself, without knowing what sex it is met for... does sound feminine to me.|`|ZX2so3twaa	i automatically think of girl when i hear that name.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	I had a Great Uncle Aubrey....it was always a male name to me. Not sure how and why it became a female name...|`|igvUbqkyaa	Although it was originally a boy's name, many names were originally boy's names that are now completely feminine. I think it is just too girly and he would probably be the only Aubrey (for a boy) that anyone knows and will most likely have at least one girl Aubrey as a classmate and you know he will get picked on because of it.|`|U1h6Dntjaa	Ever watch the new Digrassi show?  One of the actors (must be around 18 or 19 years old) is named Aubrey.  Then again, it's a Canadian show...<br>  <br>  I think that names ending in -ey, -ie, -i, and -y are feminine sounding simply because so many of them are girl names.  This factor is what kind of ruins names like Kelsey and Aubrey as boy names for me.  (This somehow escapes nicknames - I don't think Johnny, Bobby, Billy, Jimmy, etc. are girly sounding at all.)|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I can see why you like it on a boy especially since it was originally a boys name but I don't think it would go down too well in high school. He would probably be called a girl since he has a 'girls' name.|`|AA11273571	There is a male Aubrey in my home town.  I like the name for a boy.|`|FpwRrOwxaa	I've always thought of it as 25% girl's name and 75% boy's name. Love it!|`|ocwIcfzPaa	I have only ever thought of it as a boy's name. I love it!|`|d6e11chxaa	I really like it. I would love to hear it on a boy, as I can't stand it on a girl. I think it's still masculine enough to use on a boy, although I would be careful to pick a strong, more obviously masculine name to the casual observer. However, I think it could be a bit confusing to the average person, especially with the rise in popularity of Audrey.  <br>  <br>  It's funny, I think of Madison as still usable for a boy. Avery is another name that could work on a boy. It's still in the top thousand for boys, but it's being used for girls, too. Morgan is one of the only names stolen by girls that I think is irretrievable.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	I, personally used to dislike the name Aubrey altogether. Probably because I kept hearing it on people's lists for girls. I really grew to hate it. Then one day I was watching a TV show, and there was a guy whose real name (as in he wasn't a character or somthing) was Aubrey. I thought it was so cool. I think it fits a boy better than a girl. I do see a bit of where it could have a girly side to some people, but I still hate it for a girl. Since seeing a male with the name Aubrey, I've added it to my "guilty pleasures" list. <br>  <br>  I, personally think it's masculine enough for a boy, but with it being used so much on girls, I don't think other peope would take it well. Many, many people would imagine a little girl when seeing the name Aubrey, when just a fraction of us would possibly see a little boy. Sadly, I think Aubrey is the new Ashley. I think he would be the only male Aubrey in his class at school, and possibly surrounded by little girl Aubrey's. That may or may not make him a target for teasing that he has a "girls name". <br>  <br>  I do think it's a good choice for your list. I've been thinking about puting it on my real list (but only as a middle name) instead of the gulity pleasures list.<br>  <br>  I'd say that if you and your husband both really like it, then go for it. Just make sure he has a really masculine middle name that he can fall back on if he ends up really hating for a while.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|NklSNoNVaa	Not well at all. Sorry gals -- it's too close to Audrey, too feminine, too fey, too English/Masterpiece Theatre.<br>  <br>  It will without any doubt get your kid mocked and could result in a complex or withdrawal syndrome. Why saddle him with a name that suits some literary pretension OF YOURS instead of a name HE would want?|`|71e15ac317ae5351e487d5c38939daabaa	I have only heard it for girls. Even if it used to be mainly a boys name, I think that since the popularity has switched, people would think it was a girls name.|`|6Lv5HTevaa	ive heard of more girls with it but there is a guy in baseball named aubrey huff or something like that i love that name but whatever you and your husband think is what rele matters|`|hXQ56DQKaa	I think it works quite well for a boy. Aubrey has never struck me as feminine.|`|SxPhldhhaa	I think Aubrey would work very well for a boy, actually. I've always thought of the name Aubrey as being masculine. Perhaps it's because of its slightly harsh sound, but I just can't see it as a femine name and would honestly never think of using it for a girl. <br>  <br>  I actually wrote a short story for my school's literary magazine in which I named a female character Aubrey. She was a snobby character, and although I don't have anything against girls named Aubrey, I just felt that Aubrey was a fitting name for her harsh character and a feminine sounding name wouldn't have worked as well for her. For this reason, I never really was able to picture a female Aubrey who wasn't a snob.<br>  <br>  I definitely think that you could get away with using the name Aubrey, as it's still very masculine-sounding to me. Also, I'm assuming that you'll be pairing it up with a clearly masculine middle name, which will definitely also help.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5DK546BUaa	Personally - I would only use it on a boy... but that is just me!<br>  No, I don't think it is too girly for a boy - it's a BOYS names!<br>  <br>  Besides, with what parents name their children these days (my son has a girl named Darwin in his class!), teachers will like seeing a boy's name used on a boy I think :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA: I cornered his teacher on the playground and asked! I usually spend every Friday in his class reading, and so I know all of the kids. Darwin, however, was new and an enigma... not a name that I would expect to see on a girl!|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Aubrey, Ashley, & Kelsey are girl names... Please use it on a girl

CNB7WITFaa	very wrong. at ur age u shouldnt even be thinking about sleeping with a guy.|`|x08oohwpaa	I think your question should be "why did I do this?"  <br>  I think some people are being very harsh towards you.  I'm worried about you.  Did you have sex because you were curious? wanted to feel attractive or cool? It wasn't because you were in love, so why?  If you don't know why you did it you need to do some soul searching.  15 is young, your to young to worry about STDs, babies and other girls saying you're a slut.  <br>  Find someone (an adult with more life experience then the kids on answers) to talk with.

So go get a pregnancy test because YOU WILL NEED IT.<br>  <br>  edit: Cheyenne, yes, its trashy to have sex where other people could possibly see :) Sorry I'm not trash?  And it's Pantoufle.  Panto just sounds silly, don't you think?|`|ENANtueuaa	wow, 2 weeks huh...you don't waste much time! plus you're only 15...that's funny..and nasty! you can get pregnant even if he pulls out. i suggest you stop having sex with random guys, unprotected! hopefully you aren't pregnant, but there is a chance. Sorry!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Mistakes happen just don't let it happen again. If you must have sex insist on a condom and don't accept anything less. Anything less is him disrespecting you body. Go get yourself STD tested at your doctor's or to Planned Parenthood. Condoms do not just protect you against pregnancy but also against STD's, keep in mind most men do not have symptoms when they have an STD, so he may say he is clean but do not trust them when they say this when they can back it up with paperwork (from a dr) then maybe. Love and respect yourself nobody is going to do it like you.<br>  <br>  Edit: You are not a slut for making a mistake and sleeping with one guy. Just think about it and give a relationship way more than two weeks for sex, if he isn't willing to build a real relationship with you, which can take months, then he isn't worth it.|`|xPR7g0wFaa	Were you wrong for doing this?

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I will answer again, but someone IM'd me with this as I was on my way out th edoor.<br>  <br>  The most likely cause is that you have a severe oversupply.  When a baby is nursing their brain actually keeps track of how much fat and calories the have, if you have way too much milk then they get a lot of watery foremilk which doesn't trigger them being full.  So they then throw that all up, and then get the fatty milk which is what they really need.<br>  <br>  Or overactive letdown can just make them swallow too much air/otherwise throw up.<br>  <br>  Start here:<br>  Spitting Up & Reflux in the Breastfed Baby<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/reflux.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/ref...</a><br>  <br>  Forceful Let-down (Milk Ejection Reflex) & Oversupply<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/fast-letdown.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/fast-l...</a>|`|n3PE2lvDaa	he may have reflux. You may want to take him to the doctor for advice on how to help him hold it down. Or it could be that he is very gassy. Try to burp him more while feeding him and see if that helps. When babies are on a liquid diet and wind gets trapped behind the milk it can cause them to throw up when the gas comes up. I would try burping him frequently while feeding and ee if that helps. If not I would take him to the doc for advice|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	My middle child would projectile spit like that, and it was horrifying at first (and very messy).

My niece had it and she would feed and then it would all come up again - loads of it - projectile is the word.  Then obviously she would be starving!<br>  <br>  She had to get thickners for her formula milk but in your case as your are breastfeeding this wouldn't be the case.<br>  <br>  I would let him feed for 5 mins and then take him off and give him a good winding and then let him on again - swapping boob to boob.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	He may have gas.

His little tummy couldn't handle all the food in it and he got sick.|`|v9x3xGpvaa	try putting your breast milk into a bottle. or you could try starting him on baby formula. congrats on the little man!|`|a7pgX1W8aa	When my older son was a baby he had a similar problem. When he threw up it was like the exorcist and I didn't know what to do either.  When I was pregnant with him I was going to the Chiropractor because my back was killing me and it helped me. So I went to my Chiropractor and told him what was going on and he said he could help him stop throwing up so much. He said there is some kind of bone in his spine that is pushing on his stomach and it makes him throw up. After the first 2 visits he wasn't throwing up anymore, just maybe a little spit up, and after a one or two more visits he wasn't even doing that anymore. Then all I had to do is take him in about every two weeks for a little bit or sooner if he started to spit up again and it cleared him right up.<br>  <br>  I have had 2 other kids since him and I take took them to the Chiropractor for just spit up (thank god not more exorcist throw up with them) and they are doing great.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds kinda strange, but it really does work. Try it. Don't let anyone pin Acid Reflux as being your babies problem because the doctor tried to tell me it was acid reflux for my son and prescribed meds, but I didn't want to give it to him if I didn't have to. Hope this helps.|`|w3ob12X6aa	ok well sounds like what my daughter did. she is 3 months old now. but when she was a that little she would always want to nurse like all the time and then she would throw up soo much too. so i went to the doctor and he told me that she was gettin over stuffed. but the thing with my daighter was that it was a comfort thing for her she just felt comfortable being next to me and she liked to suck, so regardless if she was hungry or not she would still get milk. so what i did was look for a pacifier that was shaped like a mothers nipple and after she would eat for awhile i would give her that and she would be fine.so it might be a comfort thing with sucking or he might have bad reflex. but good luck . sorry about the novel i wrote lol|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if he is projectile vomiting , he needs to see his doc asap|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think the best thing for you to do would be to call your doc or the on call doctor because at 8 days old he should not be throwing up, I don't think it would have to do with your supply because that shouldn't make a baby throw up.

g7XmorbCaa	I agree-If you think you might be -Buy a test before you make a big deal about it and get everyone involved in the baby fever.

C6oTOvOMaa	I'm 37 weeks and 4 days pregnant. When my doctor last checked me on thursday i was 2 centimeters dilated. before i found out i was dilated at all I would get sharp stabbing pains which felt like they were inside of my vagina up to the cervix. it is hard to explain but it could get painful at times and other times would make me jump. this was definitely not the baby either. other then those pains i have had a lot of pelvic bone pain from the baby being head down and engaged for so long. But i believe that the sharp pains i got in ym cervix was from me dilating..good luck!|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	Usually you can walk around 1-3cm dilated and not even know it.<br>  <br>  What you do "feel" is contractions. Which for most women are like menstrual cramping at first or off and on back pain with tightening of the uterus.|`|RPPrfphqaa	when i went into labor..there was an enormous amount of pressure....and it felt like my a$$ was falling off LOL<br>  i dont think you really feel anything until your on the way to the hospital...<br>  i had preterm labor was 2cm dilated didn't even know..6months pregnant at the time.<br>  then i had her at 8months by the time i got to the hospital i was 51/2cm..you just have this enormous amount of pressure on your private area...not "stab" like you described it..<br>  but i know in late pregnancy your vigina does hurt and stretches as the baby goes into place.|`|eDmdkUO3aa	I couldn't really tell I was dilating besides maybe more discharge, but yet again, that was me slowly loosing my mucus plug. My vagina did hurt like a week before I had my baby and it would kind of feel how you described.|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	you can dilate with out feeling anything but it is most often with labour pain ,similar to period pain but stronger ..what you are describing sounds more like the baby kicking or pressing on nerves.

F6lZHRkVaa	If she only breastfeeds every other day, it will be harder to keep up her milk supply. She would probably have to still supplement with bottles on the day that she breastfeeds.<br>  <br>  Have her pump her milk, and then you could feed the baby pumped milk. Or alternatively, you can give the baby one bottle a day and your mom can breastfeed the rest of the time.<br>  <br>  If you use bottles, make sure you get a size 1 nipple for the entire time your mom is breastfeeding. The size 1's are smaller and will help the baby avoid nipple confusion. Make sure you don't introduce the bottle until breastfeeding is down pat, maybe 2-3 weeks.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Unless she's pumping and using expressed breastmilk, the more she supplements with formula the more her supply will go down. But she can express milk for you to feed the baby with, sure! However, I'd wait a few weeks until her breastmilk is established and until the baby has started on a good nursing routine - otherwise she might get nipple confusion and not want the breast.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	It does not work like this<br>  The bottle can confuse young babies and can decrease moms milk supply! <br>  Maybe once the baby is a little older your mom could pump alittle and let you give the baby a bottle|`|alMWU45waa	yes you can my midwife told me that i could bottle feed in the day (FORMULA) and breast feed at night so i wouldn't wear myself out|`|EZQIOIxxaa	Once breast feeding is well established I think it would be okay.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	Yes, just tell her to pump breast milk.|`|q1b2OrOZaa	You can absolutely do both! (either formula or expressed breast milk).<br>  <br>  But..she should wait a few weeks, if possible, for the baby to become really good at breastfeeding, and avoid nipple confusion.
OXxKTM6vaa	I much prefer Hannah Alexandra Rose.. I personally think it flows alot more. It also sounds quite modern yet sophisticated. It holds a nice twist. Its also very pretty and feminine. Overall a beautiful little girls name.|`|e4M4uQXNaa	I love all the names, but not together lol.  Hannah, Victoria and Rose are all classics but sound too much together.  Plus, I can't stand Rose as a middle name anymore lol.<br>  <br>  And while Alexandra is cute, I also like Alexandrine, to get rid of the whole double -a ending you get with Alexandra lol.

It might not have strapped to the headrest-I do not recall-but you can get a case for it that straps to the headrest for about $20.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Why the thumbs down?  Target had it advertised a week or two ago in the Sunday paper.  It was a portable DVD player that also had a built in (digital) tv tuner, and it was $100 if I remember correctly.  And, whether or not it strapped to the headrest-you can buy a case that allows it to do so-I know you can, because that is what we had for our old portable DVD player.
X6as2nOAaa	No I don't think that could have hurt her only if she grabs the bottle and drinks it.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I  don't think it can harm her unless she have some of that stuff in her hands and put it in her mouth. Call the Poison Control just in case.|`|xbgCwmbdaa	Read the label. For no worries at all, use things like vinegar and water (just mix equal parts in the container your windex is in now when it's gone).|`|c73QkZ2haa	How many times do you need to ask one question before you accept an answer.....<br>  <br>  Its all natural..unless she drinks the bottle shes fine.|`|feSM2POmaa	Not unless she drinks it. She will be fine :)|`|CdwSC3etaa	Probably not, but as there is a slight chance that she would have picked something up I would call the doc. if she complains of an upset stomach. If she is under the age of one, then if she cries more than usual when eating or going to the bathroom, I would also contact the pediatrician more as a precaution then anything else. <br>  <br>  Anna swallowed so much when she was younger that the pediatrician must think I'm some sort of monster. :/ It was never anything serious, a lot of times they told me that I didn't have to bring her in at all. Your daughter should be fine. :) Good luck!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	In the time it's taken you to ask this question 3 times you could have called Poison Control and asked a reliable resource.<br>  <br>  Or you could have looked at the website and read the ingredients like I did.

Q7jMH5praa	I had my son 7 months ago by C-section and my incision doesn't hurt or ache much anymore.  It does itch something awful though and every once in a while it will sting a little, but that's more of an annoyance. Then sometimes it's numb in certain spots.

It still hurts now sometimes if i pick up really heavy things or turn the wrong way.|`|AA11476951	A few weeks after it will still hurt.

Besides the scar I have a couple bumps of scar tissue under my incision.  I have not been back to the doctors since my first week check up since the child I had by c-section has a very rare disease and it fighting for his life. I did however, call my doctor and they said scar tissue takes awhile to go away.|`|zFbhYl1Baa	mine hurt like hell for a long time. it took a good 8 weeks for the searing pain to go away. my son is five months and one week and i still have to be careful at yoga. i do post-natal yoga, but have recently tried to go back to regular yoga and pilates only to be delayed further. it's very frustrating, but i have the cutest little boy in all of the world, so it's worth it!|`|QAdBQpXraa	i'm due my second child 30th march, which will be 3 years to the date after my c section. it still feels uncomfortably tight - which is not just down to the second pregnancy, it felt that way before i got pregnant, but other than that, i think my feelings about the scar are more emotional than physical. <br>  <br>  after i'd say about 4 - 5 months is when the tenderness stopped for me.|`|0F9Ua0MCaa	absolutely fine, not had any problems, it occasionally twinges if I move or stretch in a certain way, which makes me say ouch, but then it's fine, it's just a twinge... that's 10 months on.|`|63bxt86taa	4 months this thursday :)<br>  its completly healed like any normal scar but from my belly button to my bikini line i can't feel anything at all. its all numb. :)|`|8XcRFF6Taa	17 month ago, it's okay now but it still bothers me when I shave there.

9lVjWPGqaa	aww i love edward josiah but how does addison come in? last name? a 3rd name?<br>  <br>  Scarlett is cute<br>  <br>  edwardzslady duh<3|`|5bl8pKkGaa	Ryan William<br>  and<br>  Hermia Elizibeth<br>  <br>  Please not Vincent, its my brothers name and he hates it. And sometimes he gets made fun of being called an old grampa (since people relate it to a old name)<br>  <br>  Anyway thats my opinion :)|`|HBgnkltfaa	Ryan William -- Good and traditional, but not very exciting.<br>  <br>  Edward Josiah Addison -- I love Edward and Josiah -- they're familiar but not very common.  I'm not sure they need the second middle name.  Edward Josiah flows better by itself.<br>  <br>  Vincent Lucian -- Interesting and cool!  Vincent is a timeless classic that's not too popular, and Lucian is a cool, quirky middle name.<br>  <br>  Scarlett Annabella -- Gorgeous!  Both names are pretty and stylish but not too popular, and the combo flows well.<br>  <br>  Vivian Omega -- Vivian is lovely.  Omega is a bit odd -- it's one I'd probably choose only if it's meaningful to you.  However, since it's in the middle slot, it's not bad.<br>  <br>  Hermia Elizabeth -- Hermia is one I don't think would go over well today.  It sounds to much like "herpes" or "hermaphrodite."  If you're into Shakespeare, how about Helena Elizabeth instead?|`|dGBrlJvgaa	I like Edward Josiah, but I am not keen on Addison. I think Scarlet Annabella is beautiful. Good luck.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	Ryan William<br>  <br>  Scarlett Annabella|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	omega/hermia I wouldn't use at all.But the rest are lovely!|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Ryan William- I really like Ryan, it should be used more. It's so guyish. And William is a nice, classic middle name. I like it.<br>  Edward Josiah Addison - I like Edward more for a middle name, but I still enjoy the name. I really like Josiah - it's nice and complex and powerful. Addison kinda throws the name off - I still the the name though. Addison Edward Josiah sounds better in my opinion. <br>  Vincent Lucian- I don't really like Vincent. I like Vince alot though, but Vincent makes me crings. Same with Lucian, I don't like the sound. I like Lucius and Lucia though. Not my favorite choice. <br>  <br>  Scarlett Annabella- Oh, this is so pretty! I love Scarlett, it's so classic and feminine. Same with Annabella. It flows real nice, with all the vowels in Annabella. Really lovely choice. <br>  Vivian Omega- Vivan is really pretty (I ADORE this spellling. It's like Pretty Woman, not Brad & AJ's baby.) Omega though? Come on, Vivan deserves a much prettier, and less fatty, middle name. Odette, Odelle, Megara are similar to Omega (kinda!).<br>  Hermia Elizabeth- I like the way Hermia looks. It's like Hermes, which is lovely. But the sound of the name really confuses me. I do like Elizabeth though.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Ryan William - Both names are nice but they don't flow. William Ryan is better.<br>  Edward Josiah Addison - Great name. I love Josiah and I'm glad that you got Addison on the correct gender.<br>  Vincent Lucian - Doesn't really flow. Vincent is a great name though.<br>  <br>  Scarlett Annabella - Both names are lovely but it doesn't flow. Annabella Scarlett is much better.<br>  Vivian Omega - Omega isn't a name. Vivian is nice.<br>  Hermia Elizabeth - Hermia is horrible and doesn't sound like a real name. Elizabeth is beautiful.|`|k0SSCpG9aa	i like scarlett annabella <br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlYtLcYi.lHFuAkbywgZ7Jfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220144035AA0DB3o">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ShyCBmj5aa	Umm i don't really like any of the girls names they sound like the 1800s or something<br>  <br>  Not tryin to be rude<br>  <br>  Edward Josiah- love it<br>  Ryan Willam too<br>  <br>  dont like Vincent Lucian|`|w3ob12X6aa	i personally only like scarlett very cute name but i dont like annabella|`|hb94oOSeaa	I like<br>  Vincent Lucian<br>  Scarlett Annabella|`|fAFJ8sHJaa	Vincent and Scarlett are both beautiful names!<br>  All of them are though.|`|9jNsEAFGaa	I think the boy names are perfect (Vincent is kind of weird though) The girl names are a bit too bold.

JglwzEpiaa	Well you really don't have to go to the ER or wait for 2 weeks... call your doctor's office on Monday. Tell them what is going on... they will tell you what to do... rather you should go to the ER or just go into the office. This happened to me a few times during my last pregnancy. I would call my doctor if it were during the week and he would just have me come in for emergency apt. or would tell me to go to the ER if it were a real threat. <br>  <br>  Good luck and keep resting.|`|AA10525436	I know the ER is time consuming and annoying but 2 weeks is way too long to wait.

I would do what above says and just leave him to it for 5 mins before going in and telling him it is sleepy time and time to go to sleep. And just keep it up.  However, make sure he has a cuddly toy he loves in with him.  He may play with that instead of crying.|`|h85kkDsbaa	Maybe he needs to go to bed a bit later, has his routine changed much during the day recently because this could impact on bedtime? What about a warm bath to calm him down before bed.<br>  <br>  My son is nearly 7 months and we always have about 1 hour playtime before bath, bottle and bed, this is to use up all his energy and he loves the bath too splashing about. So i think by the time i put him to bed he is so tired.|`|a7pgX1W8aa	He is just starting to feel independent and he wants to do what he wants to do. It is totally normal for him to do this as my son is doing the same thing. You are just going to have to muttle through it and let him cry eventually he will fall asleep. You could also try getting a Homedics SS-3000 Sound Spa Lullaby machine, that helped my son. Maybe if could help yours. Hope this helps.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	ihave heard that can be normal when they reach a big milestone...my dd hasn't done that however...yet anyways|`|X6as2nOAaa	When they learn to crawl then they think about it a lot and sometimes they just want to do that that might be why he gets so upset.
8lEZAwvYaa	Aww huni, this is a really sensitive issue, and I can understand whole heartly how you are feeling, but you will really need to sit down and think all of this through before you make any harsh decisions, its easy for us to tell you do this or do that but you need to know deep in your heart what you want too<br>  <br>  If you are 100% positive you will want another child, you will need to sit down n ask him his reasons for not wanting anymore children, then tell him you do, ask him if he will consider it before he goes for the snip, as this has got to be a joint decision, its not just his future he has to take into consideration,<br>  <br>  I strongly believe if he loves you enough you will both have a child together, but as you said your child is only 2weeks old, however good you feel at the moment, it will be daunting for your other half having this new baby in the house, and maybe he is feeling a little left out now your son is here, many men get jealous of the little bundles wether they are biologically theres or not, they hav had your full attention for so long then out comes this wee person to take up most of your time,<br>  <br>  Be patient but be honest, give yourself time to think everything through and remember your hormones are all over the place just now so dont jump to any harsh decisions.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope all works out the way you want it too|`|X6as2nOAaa	Ask him what his reasoning is and talk to him about it. Maybe he just doesn't want that many kids.|`|NCa8bOjSaa	I'm so sorry to hear your situation.    I can understand how you'd feel!  you're just getting started with the whole parenting thing and want to experience it again.  I don't blame you!<br>  <br>  But at the same time, you should think about how your fiance must feel about the prospect of having a 4th child of his own.  Marrying you give him an instant child.  Do you think he feels prepared to have 5 children?<br>  <br>  I don't know an easy asnwer to this.  If you love him, understand that he either may need time to reconsider his thoughts, or be prepared for him to fully decide against having more children.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel you can do that, then you need to realize it and move on, and find someone who will be able to support you with your feelings of expanding your family.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.|`|9ISneLnYaa	It is a tough situation but you have to do whats right for you and whats in your heart, if you want to have another baby some day then you shouldn't settle or you might just end up resenting your partner some where down the line and you will probably end up resenting his children too! <br>  <br>  You should talk to your partner about the possibility of another baby in a few years and if he's not willing to consider it then you unfortunately have a tough decision to make. Should you sacrifice your happiness?<br>  What ever you decide best of luck!|`|a7pgX1W8aa	He probably doesn't want to have anymore kids because he already has 5 between two different people and it's probably really hard on him, since he probably hoped that when he had kids that he would be with the person he had the kids with. Maybe he is just afraid of having it not work out with you and he doesn't want to have another failed relationship with another child with a different person. You got to figure that would be pretty hard on him. If you really love him and want to be with him, give it some time and spend time with him. Make him feel reassured that you want to be with him forever and maybe he could change his mind. In the mean time, try to get him to delay getting the vasectomy. Maybe it will work out. Hope this helps.

AA10215545	That shouldnt be bad, considering the active ingredient is generally safe for prego women. Its the caffeine in it thats not all that great.|`|SUT3yL0oaa	Go look it up at www.safefetus.com.

TuIrAXLkaa	Put him in a regular bed and start a routine that he goes to bed and stays in his bed, It will take about a week because he will come and get in your bed still and you just haft to send him back to his room if he screams and kicks sit indian style on the floor in his room with your head down. making him feel like he is making you sad, and the last thing he wants to do is make you sad so he will stop resisting, or just sit like that on the floor till he falls asleep it will work.|`|x647LeB2aa	He sounds like my daughter (now 5) was!<br>  <br>  She went into a bed at 15 months so was older than your boy.  Toddler beds tend to be lower to the ground so even if they do manage to get past the bed guard/barrier it isn't much of a fall.|`|p6AMoTs8aa	wow your baby is ahead...get him the bed with the barrier you are gonna wind up getting one anyway and it will be easier to get him to sleep there. you can lay down next to him and leave once he's knocked out|`|46tTmMT7aa	I think it would be fine to use a twin bed, with a bed rail on the side, just so he doesn't fall off. Since he can get off the bed make sure his room is baby-proofed. I don't think it would be a problem at all.|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	I'd start him out with a twin mattress on the floor, so if he falls out, it's not a big deal.  Then you can add a frame as he gets more confident.|`|n9PF3qAYaa	There is a thing called Safe T sleep or something. It can make sure your child is safe in the bed - can't roll out. You could try that.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I have a friend that moved all three of her kids at 12 months and I plan to do the same. What we did to make more room for my active sleeper is add a twin bed to our bed. My son sleeps on a twin mattress right next to me and my husband on a queen mattress. His mattress is wedged between our bed and the wall so he can't roll out. When we are ready we will just move the mattress he is already on.<br>  <br>  I would suggest just putting the mattress on the floor with a good rail on the side and the wall on the other side.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Go for it.  Worst case scenario, you have to ease him out of your bed.  Since he hates his cot, its worth moving to the bed with a barrier.  Good luck!|`|fHjSonssaa	Move him to his own bed- just make sure you have the gaurd rail there.  Yes, he knows how to safely get off of a bed while he's awake, but I bet it's another story when he's sleeping- and it sounds like he's used to having you guys there to gaurd him.<br>  <br>  I also have a feeling it's going to be difficult to get him to sleep in his own bed the first few night...we've got to tackle that situation shortly.|`|50lIaC8zaa	I would put him in his own bed, as long as he can get off it without falling which you've said he can he should be fine, just use one of those bed guard things to stop him rolling out while asleep! <br>  <br>  He is a clever little man isnt he :)|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Get him his own bed, my child hated her crib and I put her in a regular bed with a barrier and it worked great. Get him out of your bed asap!|`|tkSXjqhuaa	what about a toddler bed?
rjVALevtaa	I don't think it's a trend. Personally, I don't understand why any mother would give her child coffee. As if children don't have enough energy already!|`|sAhAEC2qaa	therers nothing you can do. its not your kid so leave her alone.|`|SoTQ4bmVaa	no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 tell her not to look im 14 and i dont even drink it not healty and might be risky to life|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	That is the most retarded thing I have heard in a long time! You need to have a serious talk with her about that!!|`|1pbWoSZ2aa	REALLY??? I'm 18 and would not even dream of giving my daughter coffee, so even young inexperienced mums aren't that silly......age doesn't have anything to do with parenting in my opinion but maybe i'm quite mature for my age? I know it's hard to just bite your tongue but it is her son and there's not much you can really do but express your opinion, but even then if your son says to leave her alone then you may just get told to stop poking your nose in....it's definitely not healthy, maybe you should try saying "would you like me to buy him a cold drink, he seems really thirsty?" just little things like that where you wont get told you're interfering but can cut down his coffee intake....i can't believe the child isn't permanently hyper??? unfortunately though there's nothing you can do while he is at home with his parents so you can only do so much??!! <br>  <br>  hard question!|`|71e15ac317ae5351e487d5c38939daabaa	She could drink a  cup of regular coffee every day and that would be fine for the baby inside her. But not much more than that. Also I dont think that her child should be drinking it. A sip here and there won't hurt but if he drinks it regularly that might not be good.|`|BUXC2Kz0aa	No amount of caffeine should be given to babies or toddlers, especially not coffee...coffee is packed to the brim with caffeine!!!!

I never let her have any caffeine.

She should be trying to establish good eating habits not promote bad ones.  You need to talk to her...

CbKOO4HFaa	If you are expecting your period to start on Friday, I would think this would be too early to be having pregnancy symptoms.  I've read that pregnancy symptoms sometimes mimic pms symptoms (tender breasts, breaking out, cramps, irritable, etc.) because of changes in hormone levels.  But if you think you were ovulating and believe that some sperm got in you, then it's possible you're pregnant.  I took a pregnancy test four days before I was supposed to start my period and it was negative, but then when I took another test the day before my expected period, it was positive!  Good luck to you!|`|fHjSonssaa	Your symptoms sound very typical of pregnancy.  But if you are pregnant, you didn't just get pregnant a week and a half ago- you're probably 6-8 weeks?  That's when symptoms usually start.  Maybe 5 weeks.|`|HXPxKEDQaa	sounds possible but you would need to take a test im no doctor [;

You're trying.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	just keep she bought it for u. she will probably get ur step bro one too.|`|0Kw2yVp4aa	if she got it for u then just keep it. tell her that ur really thankful but u dont think u deserve it. and maybe she will think that ur growing up.|`|SpYS7VYoaa	Offer it to yourstep brother since in college its almost required (he'll need it everyday for everything, professors post stuff online and you have to constantly check it)<br>  If he says no, youll know you did the right thing. Then, since you have all this information at your fingertips from the internet, improve your grades and you will have earned the laptop and put it to a great use!|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	Your mom might have valid reasons to get you one and not your step brother. <br>  <br>  Appreciate it and hold onto it. Her giving you your own laptop shows a great deal in how proud she is of you etc. Many parents don't go out and buy a laptop like that. <br>  <br>  She has her reasons. Don't feel bad.|`|H90uflbFaa	stop whinging. just be glad you got a laptop,|`|FiUprYsvaa	Just keep it. <br>  She obviously wants you to have it. <br>  You said you pulled your grades up from bad to B's and C's , which is really good. <br>  And if your birthday was a long time ago then it may be coming up soon. Maybe it is a early birthday or late christmas gift. <br>  <br>  You should keep it. Go set it up and enjoy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Your step-brother can easily get a laptop for college. There are many ways he can get one. Some colleges even loan them out.|`|TYxbaE4paa	Your mom got it for you.  If she didn't think you deserved it she wouldn't have gotten it for you.

Just make sure your not spending to much time on your new computer and keep up the hard work.<br>  Have Fun! =]|`|ebzHzyL8aa	I know exactly what you mean. My advice is to keep it and make sure to tell your mom how thankful you are for it. You're trying in school which is good enough, not everyone can make perfect grades. if you still feel bad afterwards maybe do something for your mom like do dishes or clean or something to show how thankful you are for it.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Perhaps you could share it with your step-brother. Tell him that he can use it for school whenever he needs it.<br>  <br>  You can also show your mom that you will work hard at school and prove that you do deserve the laptop.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Honey id keep it. just make sure you thank her alot and tell her you love her. keep working really hard on your grades and have fun with it|`|9zwSclnLaa	I would just work even harder now that she got you this to prove you deserve it.  Your Mom obviously did since she got it for you :)|`|BM3dDb88aa	Just work as hard as you possibly can!

I think my brother could use this laptop for school, he doesn't have one."<br>  "Shouldn't you have got this for him instead?"<br>  <br>  She might tell you "Well, you're right..."<br>  Or she could say "Mom's giving him a laptop too, for his birthday"<br>  <br>  *shrug*<br>  I think you're right, your brother would really need a laptop.<br>  You need to tell your mom to set some rules about the computer your family shares.<br>  It can be something like "each uses the computer for one hour. After one hour the next person wiill use it. If the next person does not want to use it, you can keep using it a little longer. If after that 30 min, the other person wants to use it, she can for 1 hr. " and repeat it :)<br>  <br>  That's what we did at home before I bought my laptop. Hope this helps!

2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	My son has been teething for 2 months now (since 4 months old).

He randomly wakes more at night, and fusses during feedings. He is overall fussier than before too.<br>  <br>  First thing you can do is offer all the comfort and cuddles they want... when they need more...<br>  <br>  * Freeze a wet (clean) rag and let them gnaw away at it.<br>  * Teething toys: especially the frozen teething rings (all babies prefer different ones... Jude likes the combi ones that give age ranges for different teeth coming in, and any ones that are cold)<br>  * Freeze a spoon and let your little one gnaw on it supervised.<br>  * Mesh teethers:  freeze fruit chunks or freeze applesauce/baby food in ice cube trays and pop in the teether<br>  * Popsicles or freeze-pops (stickless popsicles) <br>  * Teething biscuits, you can also freeze the teething biscuits (if they are old enough to eat them safely) for recipes: www.wholesomebabyfood.com/teethingbiscui...<br>  * Frozen mini-bagels or bananas (if they are old enough to eat them safely)<br>  * Massage the gums with your finger (you can also massage vanilla onto the gums, it helps soothe the pain)<br>  *Teething tablets (Hyland's) or teething drops (Gentle Naturals) <br>  * Oragel, sparingly... if your baby can stand it... be careful it can affect their gag reflex, make sure it has worn off before feeding the baby; it also tastes terrible, and it is easy for your LO to swallow more than he should of it.<br>  * OTC Medication: Acetaminophen/Tylenol or Ibuprofen/Motrin (ONLY if your child is over 6 months) Always use the recommendations by your child's weight. Only use as a last resort, as teething will last a long time and you want to save the pain meds for the days (and nights) they REALLY need it.|`|rTAvnldfaa	sounds like she is definately teething! My little boys first tooth first came through at 7 months but teething can cause problems for them ages before the actually come through.<br>  <br>  you can get soothers which you put in the fridge which help soothe their gums i found those really good, or a stick of cucumber or carrot would be good to gum on.|`|rFXt8ygGaa	yep thats all the signs of teething but if ur realy worried bring her to ur gp|`|PIfaJRuoaa	That sounds very much like teething, I suggest buying Hyland's Homeopathic Teething Tablets at your local grocery store or pharmacy.  They are all natural and work wonders when your baby all of a sudden gets fussy or cranky due to teething.<br>  <a href="http://www.hylands.com/products/teething.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.hylands.com/products/teething...</a><br>  My son is 3 months and has started teething and usually the first teeth are the bottom just as you described.  And you've indicated most of the major signs of teething.  You can try baby orajel but my pediatrician says that it can numb the baby's throat.  So we prefer the Teething Tablets.
76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	I'm so glad you didn't go for the cliched matchy or same letter names :). I hate when people do that and I'm sure twins do too. But I love the names you chose. I love how Amaya and Madison could be Maya and Madi when they're young and it's still cute, but be Amaya and Madison when they're older and want their own identities. And Brayden and Jacob sound really well together, without being too matchy.<br>  <br>  For boy/girl twins, I like Amaya Elise and Brayden Lee. I love the way they sound together.|`|uuceuyRyaa	I like them <33<br>  <br>  and grants on twins!!!<br>  <br>  :D|`|04F4149yaa	I think they are lovely :)<br>  <br>  For a boy and a girl:<br>  Boy: Ryan Lee <br>  Girl: Renata Skye|`|5bl8pKkGaa	Aww their cute<br>  <br>  For a boy and a girl do<br>  Madison Skye Hylton-King (Madi)<br>  and<br>  Brayden Lee Hylton-King<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	I think those are great names!

tHjfdrPmaa	love it|`|2rOQyvaKaa	I like Selene more.|`|FL67UPPHaa	Beautiful. I'm planning to name my first daughter Serena Catherine!<br>  <br>  I love the meaning -- calm, peaceful, serene -- and I imagine a feminine, gentle and intelligent girl. It has a lively and modern spark to it too, without being trendy. <br>  <br>  I don't know anyone named Serena in real life, it's fairly uncommon where I live.<br>  <br>  If you've picked the name for your baby, then you've made a great choice :)|`|WyQuDaRyaa	I like it. Funny, my friend just asked me what I thought of this name. She's thinking about naming her baby this..but she doesn't know the sex yet. I think it's a really pretty name and not too common either. I've actually only known one Serena..a really sweet little girl I knew years ago. Great choice!|`|U1juqahIaa	I love it.  I think it's a beautiful, sophisticated name.<br>  <br>  I know a Serena and she is a little shy and sensitive, but she's also very sweet and intelligent so that's what I associate with the name.|`|XucYKJgaaa	Serena is a beautiful name...it gives the impression of one actaully being beautiful! I'm using the name Serena in the book im writing.

There was this one Tarra I knew growing up. She was nice but didn't really know when people were making fun of her.|`|cn0ALwwLaa	Tara seems plain to me. It is also concervative. 'Tyra' is a new name. It kinda makes you sound more wild. I'd choose something else.<br>  <br>  Of course names today are like Justice, Radiance. Shine, Kimora, Beyonce, Monyque spelled all different ways, Janiqua and all weird mash-ups.<br>  <br>  Tara sounds ordinary. I dont really lime that name.<br>  <br>  I think the proper name for that is Tamzen. My down the block neighbor was named Tamzen, Tami, actually, but that came from Tamzen.<br>  <br>  Go with Erin.|`|igvUbqkyaa	I don't love the name. It is okay but I would never name my daughter the name. I think Tara has the connotation of a very snotty and spoiled girl - a princess type. I think it is because Tara sounds like tiara which makes me think of some stupid high school girl wearing a tiara on her birthday because she thinks she is a 'princess'.|`|DP48dIxhaa	I don't like the name Tara! Myy little sissys friend Tara is rlly annoying, loud, and crazy.

Either way Tara is definitely a wonderful name to me :)|`|QneuTsEoaa	I love it lol. I dont think the name makes the person in any way. I think the way a person is raised and what the person is exposed to makes the person.|`|tzPEckiZaa	I've known two Taras, they're both beautiful and graceful.

NGz7R9enaa	Parents can be so funny sometimes. I can't say exactly what is going on, but from experience I can tell you that sometimes we think too much and take it to heart. A mother loves her children, it doesn't matter what they look like, what grades they get or how well they clean their room. Your mom has four kids, she has a lot on her plate and she knows every single one of you inside and out whether you believe it or not. <br>  <br>  I think you should sit down, away from everyone else and talk to her about how you feel. Tell her that you don't feel like you are getting enough attention and are wondering if it is because you have done something wrong or if she doesn't like you. I am sure you will be surprised if you just talk to her, openly and honestly.

It predisposes them, as it were, but it's only my opinion - you'll do as you see fit..|`|cdNkuSaAaa	Yes, I have before. It is a beautiful name.

ca19bebe4ab46bdb76b47d96f135523eaa	I haven't had any dilemma's at all! But for you I wouldn't worry too much. if your blood work comes back great you could just relax. Stress is not good for you or your baby.:) As far as your bump goes, that is completely normal. I had a belly and then the next day is was gone... it's weird I know, but the baby may be towards your back more then up front. Plus at 9w-11w it's not that big! You might just get one ultrasound too, unless there is issues with this pregnancy. Also, you can have up to 200mg of caffeine a day. (keep that in mind) Good luck and relax!|`|ODM6fORNaa	yes, the bump could of just been from being bloated since that is around the time you get the first symptom of being pregnant....you are very bloated! Also being stopped up and constipated which is another symptom, it too can cause your stomach to pooch out and feel hard.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	Most expectant mums worry about their baby's progress and health.  The fact that you have had a miscarriage doesn't mean you will have problems this time, so, try to relax and enjoy your pregnancy.  Both you and your bub will benefit enormously.  Good Luck|`|0SHOXqb4aa	You know what I think is wrong with you?  I think the pregnancy hormones are upsetting you and making you frantic with irrational worries.  Miscarriages are common - most of the time they are not linked to any particular women and are just random.  Most of the time having a miscarriage is not an indication that another one is likely.  <br>  <br>  As for the scan, all that they can tell at the early scan is that you are pregnant and how many babies are in the womb and how far on you are with the pregnancy.  With my first pregnancy, I had a scan at 12 weeks and another at 20 weeks.  The second time around I opted not to have the first scan because I was certain of my dates and didn't see the point.  <br>  <br>  You say you are not as healthy as you should be.  It depends on what you mean.  If you have specific health problems, the doctors and midwives will give you special attention.  They get all sorts of women with all sorts of health problems and they know what to do.  <br>  <br>  But it sounds as if you just mean your general state of health.  Forget about it.  Babies are tough.  Don't smoke or drink alcohol and take folic acid supplements.  Other than that just stop worrying.   I don't think the bump you felt was anything to do with pregnancy.  You don't normally get it until later.  Ask you doctor, but the bump was probably nothing.  Good luck.|`|RPPrfphqaa	I think your worrying over nothing...i got pregnant with my 1st at 18 now im 21 and pregnant wtih my second.<br>  your stomach is going to hurt your going to have sharp pains its round ligament pain...if you made it to 12 weeks you really have nothing to worry about that is the cut off limit for miscarriages...soon as you hit 3months its highly unlikely and rare that you'll have a miscarriage...<br>  and your not going to have an ultrasound every time you go to the doctor<br>  you'll have one between 18-20 weeks...then you'll have another one around 32 weeks. You can't be calling your doctor with every little problem you get too...sit down relax..stop stressin<br>  stress effects the baby too.<br>  i have a friend that annoys the crap out of me...she's 12 weeks she goes to the hospital almost every other day because she over reacts about crap she shouldn't....if she gets a little pain she's going to the e.r...if her back hurts she's going to the e.r..<br>  if she's sick she's going to the e.r..<br>  if she has a little bit a stomach pain she's going there too..<br>  its sickening.<br>  just enjoy your pregnancy it doesn't last long and you dont wanna waste the time you have worrying about stuff you shouldn't worry about.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I think you are just over-thinking things. It should all be well.
1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Actually, secondary infertility is more common than you think.  Don't freak out yet, It can take a perfectly healthy and fertile couple up to a year to conceive.  each month you have around a 25% chance to conceive.  So, nine months still isn't that bad.  Don't stress.  Once you hit the one year mark make an appointment with your OBGYN to discuss.<br>  <br>  Some ideas to try if you interested.......<br>  <br>  -Ovulation testers.  Sometimes you ovulate other than the 14th cycle day of the month.  This can help you pinpoint ovulation and time intercourse better.<br>  -Avoid oral sex around ovulation.  The PH in saliva can harm sperm.  Also avoid the typical over the counter lubricants.  If you and hubby use one, switch to Preseed which you can buy over the internet and at some stores.  It is fertility friendly and won't harm sperm.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!

Landon Ryan is cute too, but I think I would personally switch it to Ryan Landon so they don't have such similar names and the same initials. Instead of being both L.R.___, they'd be L.R.___ and R.L.____. But by having the same initials switched around, they'll still sound like twins, while keeping their own individuality. Just a thought :). But I really love Lily Rose.|`|tzPEckiZaa	lily rose and landon ryan|`|z4blIUneaa	i like alexandra raine and landon ryan <br>  or<br>  kelsey rae and keegan ryan<br>  <br>  good luck:)
2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	If you're doing the fisher price rainforest theme, buy it quick... as they're selling it all off to make way for the precious planet theme (which i think is cuter). anyway check craigslist and ebay. i saw the entire fisher price rainforest set (swing, pac n play, jumperoo, activity gym, bouncy seat, high chair, bedding set, mobile) up on craigslist (chicago) for cheap.|`|PIfaJRuoaa	We have the rain forest theme, the nice thing is that it is all on clearance now and I wish that it had been when I got it.  The only piece we don't have is the high chair but I can tell you that the swing is amazing it swings in 2 different directions and has a lot of music and my son falls asleep in it all the time.  Also, the bouncy chair with the rain forest theme is the best one out there, it is the only one that I've found that lights up and out of the 2 chairs he has, that's the one he will sit in for hours.  I suggest going to Party Warehouse or something similar because they always have Hawaiian themed items such as lei's or palm trees, and fun decorative items you could use to help decorate the nursery accordingly.<br>  #1 Item I couldn't live without though is the rain forest vibrating bouncy chair.  I put my son in it at least 2-3 hours a day.  It's his favorite toy.|`|u94HOVz7aa	i have the rainforest theme complete set.  just so you know the travel swing was recalled and changed so if you buy one second hand check the model number with the recall list.  the pack and play was recalled because the sides collapes none should be sold anymore they are issuing refunds.  the big swing is awsome because you can plug it in, but about 50% have a bad motor i went through 3 before i got one that would actually swing a newborn.  loving the bouncer but the toy bar there is a monkey that moves up and down which now gets stuck and makes an awful noise.  and it's only been use since christmas eve.  toy mats are great, accessories are nice like the mirror for the car LOVE that.  um the bedding set i am still trying to get my hands on i can only find on ebay and it goes for way too much.  just keep in mind.  they came out with a new set called precious planet that is similar but in my opinion WAY cuter and it is all just coming out so you should be able to find all the pieces easier.<br>  <br>  edit*  i have the full sized high chair and i love it.  so far i have only used it for neices and nephews, but i love it all the same.  best parts are that it is height adjustable and collapses for storage.|`|QXREldcEaa	not sure that you are looking for this answer, but the (full size) rainforest cradle swing is awesome!  It plugs into the wall, so no batteries!  And its adorable!|`|j6yVurY3aa	Ikea has this really cool looking plam tree light.  I think you will find it in the kid section.|`|AykczQleaa	If I were you I don't know If I would do the rain forest theme...its all on clearance here and soon you might not be able to find all of the items.
p8otQ2vuaa	oh wow.<br>  i don't think it's possible for him to see "the light".<br>  he's right you ARE too young to be his girlfriend.<br>  but hey you can still be friends.<br>  best of friends.<br>  okay?<br>  <br>  let us not be a pedophile|`|Iyvt7ibmaa	You are a little young to be going on about a 20 year old, but if you do like him, then there's not much one can tell you to do. The only way he can go to prison for being with you is if you have sex with him. the statutory limit for most states in the US is 16 years old. A couple other states are 14, so you'd have to do some research for the state you live in to find out. Also, it's technically considered statutory if your ages are further than 5 years apart after the statutory limit. I.e. if you're 16 and he's a full 5 years older than you, it's considered statutory until you're 18. Also, these statutory limits are placed on the parents. so, if your parents want to press charges if you two do get into anything sexual, they have every right to do so until you're 18 and out of the house. <br>  The legalities being said, just be yourself! Don't go crazy psycho on him, and if he doesn't want to be with you, learn to let go. It'll be hard, but you can do it. And if he does like you and wants to be with you, then go right ahead!<br>  Good luck!|`|tYEk3wsjaa	If you say he is 'kinda famous', what kind of famous is he?<br>  If you have his email address he could easily be a fake and you could easily be talking to some 50 year old man!<br>  And a relationship between a 13 year old and a 20 year old isn't often going to work, unless you are very mature and he is very immature, you will be want different things, he will want things you wont be ready for! He will soon he able to legally drink and you wont be able to go see a 15 rated movie?|`|I3jYOT9haa	He's kind of old for you. Find someone closer to your own age =] This way you don't have to worry about him going to jail for beinga child molester. You can still be friends with him though.|`|l0BN70vKaa	you should wait like 5 years or so<br>  maybe you have a better chance because<br>  your young and people can take it as a joke or something<br>  you know and you like the dude so wait a little bit ok?<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|mPpJc2mhaa	Well, I agree with you completely. My parents are 8 years apart, and are doing fine! Wait a few years, maybe until you're 16, and he's 23, and then things will change, trust me. You will both be more mature. Keep in contact with him. Hope I helped! BYE!|`|s0wUXkIRaa	1, it is physically impossible to be "in love" at your age.<br>  #2 if you were to somehow get this guy he would go to jail for being a pedophile|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	He's too old for you -- especially according to the law, who would arrest him for statutory rape if you dated.|`|GSeKuBkYaa	***** U BOUT STUPID AZ HELL!!!!!!!!!!!

If he did fall for you, he'd go to jail.  You wouldn't want that right!?!

Right now, it's just weird.  Just wait.  Everything will turn out just right for you.|`|AA11510511	You shouldn't even be interested in someone of that age.  You are still a child.|`|AA10015577	YOU are considered jail-bait and if he's "not really" single then why bother especially if it seems he doesn't have a "thing" for you.<br>  <br>  He is obviously smart enough to know better and you are just going through a crush phase.  Your still only a child, keep it that way.|`|WmQzUqfEaa	Ummm...you don't. He's 7 years older than you, and you're 13. That automatically qualifies as statutory rape and he will go to jail, even if you want sex. You are not of the legal age.<br>  <br>  And besides, HE said no. So that means NO, he is not interested in you.|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Sorry hun I don't think he'll 'see the light' on this one...cause that would make him a child molester.<br>  <br>  You have a crush on an older guy, that's ok and normal...just realize its only a crush, ok?|`|AA10556677	Please, please, please stop talking to him.

Yn6pM2Xyaa	I tried to search online for you to find the info, hoping maybe I'd stumble upon it.  No luck but there seems to be clamps you can buy to attach two strollers and there also seems to be clamps that attach two wheelchairs so..... perhaps one or both would work to convert a regular stroller to attach on?  Another thought I had was to contact either a non-profit charity that specializes in helping children or parents with needs and see if they can help out.  Only last avenue I would suggest would be to contact a wheelchair/special needs supplier and see if they know of the item you are searching for.  If you live in the UK I found this source for help: Fledglings are a non-profit making organisation who help find specialist products for disabled children. Their website is www.fledglings.org.uk, telephone 0845 458 1124.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you in finding a reasonable solution to your unfortunate problem.  It really shouldn't be this hard to find a solution!  ?|`|aJG5D0Vkaa	i really want to help you but i typed "stroller which attaches to a wheelchair" at google.com but i could not find anything i am going to look again. and i will add some details to my answer later so this is not my final answer.

1SGl03Zlaa	Any diaper cream with Zinc Oxide as an ingredient stings.  I tried some on myself after spending 4 weeks in a pad after delivery and threw the stuff out because it hurt so bad.  The only thing I've ever used on my daughter for a rash is cornstarch and some vitamin A&D ointment or vaseline.  I put the cornstarch on first to keep the area dry that way the cream doesn't lock in the moisture.  I also use a bit of cornstarch at every diaper change when there is no rash to prevent one from starting.|`|Jswomud7aa	The magnesium in the desitin could be hurting her abraded skin. Use A & D ointment, NOT cream. It should look like Vaseline. This is what I used on my two babies because they reacted exactly like your lil' girl did.<br>  <br>  She could be teething. When my son teethes he gets diarrhea really bad.

qtCVLDFxaa	There is no proven way to induce and usually your body will start labor when its ready. However when I went past due-date without any effacement/dilation, I used evening primrose oil.<br>  <br>  It is in the form of gel-caps and can be bought in health food stores. The theory is that it contains prostaglandines, which are like progesterone, a hormone your body produces to start ripening your cervix. It WILL NOT cause contractions (like castor oil claims) but it will help your body get ready.<br>  <br>  You can start orally at 37 weeks, 1 gel-cap a day;<br>  At 38 weeks, 1 gel-cap 3 times a day orally (with meals);<br>  At 39 weeks, 2 gel-caps 3 times a day orally;<br>  At 40 weeks and more, 2 gel-caps 3 times a day orally plus 1 gel-cap inserted as far back vaginally as you can (with clean hands) at bedtime. It is important to remain lying down after because the gel-cap gradually melts and the oil is absorbed by the tissue on/near your cervix. If you stand up, it will just leak back out.<br>  <br>  Within 1 week of starting treatment, I was 50% effaced and 1 cm dilated. I went into labor naturally the day before I was scheduled to be induced. <br>  <br>  Hang in there, those last weeks are the most trying times....|`|K5TrkUhCaa	If you aren't dilated or effaced at all then you can try using evening primrose oil to help ripen your cervix. They come in gel caps and you just take a clean needle and poke a hole in the top of the gel cap and insert it as far back into your vagina as you can get it and then it's best to lay down for about 30-60 minutes (depending on how much time you have to spare) that way the oil can really get to the cervix. I always put 2 gel caps at a time in about 2-3 times a day. It has helped ripen my cervix (unfortunately I haven't gone into labor yet, but it has helped me dilate and efface at least). Also, drinking red raspberry leaf tea will help to tone and strengthen your uterus for the big show. Walking is a great way to get baby to drop and may get contractions going as well. Nipple stimulation releases oxytocin which starts contractions that may become true labor. Congrats to you and good luck!|`|OxxrqzCzaa	They say you can induce labor by having sex.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I know you are anxious but hang in there..you have waited all this time, you can wait a couple more weeks. Your body won't go into labor until it is ready anyway.  When the baby's lungs are mature, they secrete a hormone that tells the mother's body to start producing oxytocin. The oxytocin then starts contractions. By making your body produce oxytocin (or inducing at the hospital with the medicine pitocin(which is the artificial form of oxytocin) before it is ready, you are taking the chance that your baby's lungs aren't developed enough yet. Baby knows when it is developed and ready to come out. Let nature take it's course and your baby will be here in no time. The longer baby is in the womb, the better. If there is no medical reason, I wouldn't induce.|`|GUUgeptjaa	Apparently without my knowing, lobster and movie theater popcorn put me into labor, my first I went to the movies and ate some popcorn and all of a sudden the next day I was at the hospital giving birth.  <br>  <br>  My second I ate lobster for a special occasion and a few days later while cleaning my water broke.<br>  <br>  I am not sure if it was those two, or my babies just like to come early.

Those were the tips my doctor gave me with my first born.  Of course, they didn't work and I ended up beind induced with pitocin, haha.  <br>  <br>  Do NOT take castor oil.  I stupidly tried that twice my first pregnancy at the urging of my sister and mother in law.  It did nothing but make me ill and gave me horrible diarhea.  I found out after the fact that it can cause a baby to pass their first bowel in utero.

Your baby will come when he or she is ready. Don't rush the process.|`|6e70e7d501967a20f043a094a0f218a6aa	Believe me i tried everything <br>  liquorice<br>  raspberry tea<br>  driving over bumps<br>  walking every where<br>  lots of sex etc.......<br>  but i went 2 weeks over with all my children.Unfortunately nothing works ,i know how you feel though it really drags and is uncomfortable towards the end of pregnancy.Good luck,not long now.Hope the labour all goes well!xx
AA11296427	Do you know your baby already has little fingers, and a heartbeat? Why don't you adopt it, not kill it?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  : ]|`|aOCfLAJJaa	I think they do it with pills now, it will hurt your emotionally more than physically. <br>  <br>  The first pill stops hormones going to the egg and the second one detaches it I think. Of course, they could all ways do the old fashioned way which I know jackshit about.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Here are all the ways abortion can be performed:<br>  <a href="http://www.bygirlsforgirls.org/previousby4g/abortiontypes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bygirlsforgirls.org/previousb...</a><br>  <br>  It can hurt, for some people it hurts a lot and for some people it feels like menstrual cramps.  You will feel bad for a while, but you'll be okay.|`|7SCjPftKaa	I wasn't going to answer this but I saw "once you have an abortion, medical problems stay with you for the rest of your life". <br>  <br>  Don't listen to that person, she is clearly an idiot.|`|6mBpkt3Daa	It's okay hun. You made the right decision for yourself. It's your opinion that matters, not anyone elses. You may get a lot of hatin' answers on her, but don't listen to those :) God bless you :)|`|Orx9cTJJaa	Honestly, it has a chance of killing you too. I don't want you to die, but I hope it hurts.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	ignore the ignorant replies you get on here. It is your decision, not anyone else's.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Don't worry about anyone else's opinions, only yours matters.<br>  <br>  You need to get in ASAP because you can't just walk into a clinic and they perform it within the hour. Remember, it can cost more than $500.<br>  <br>  The actual procedure is scary, but the nurses and doctor are there with and for you. It hurts, almost like really bad period cramps. But, it all goes away within a few seconds or minutes.  They either give you pain pills or Ibuprofen. Is there someone with you?<br>  <br>  During the procedure, take deep breaths and try to calm down. It is the scariest thing you will probably ever go through.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  ALSO: You will  not have serious physical problems for the rest of your life if you only have one abortion. You may be under so much stress right now, but once it is over, you will remember it, but you will move on! Be smart and use protection...|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I don't think dying is ever "better off for the baby", I think you mean it is better off for you.<br>  And if you think it is such a horrible decision, then why do it? I wouldn't worry so much about it hurting physically, I would be more concerned about how it will affect you emotionally since you do not seem too sure of yourself!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Brave? Brave would be to have the baby and give it up, abortion is the easy way out!|`|xPR7g0wFaa	I don't know if it hurts, because Ive never killed a baby before. But it should, its going to hurt that poor innocent little baby. As far as the baby being better off...If you think laying in the bottom of a trash dumpster in an alley behind an abortion slaughter house is better off then giving it a chance to be loved by a family that couldn't have their own child. If things are so bad right now, why are you having sex at 14 instead of trying to make things better? I miscarried twice(8weeks&12 weeks) My babies had heartbeats. They were alive. I have three other children and I feel so blessed to have them. I have said this before..I knew when I had sex and didn't want kids, i used protection.When I wanted kids I didn't use protection. Its called responsibility. Its always easier to throw something away.|`|Uv3oSJyGaa	if you get the anestics then you dont feel a thing during the process. Afterwards you feel like you;ve had a really bad period, plus u bleed for what feels like forever! They send you home with pain meds. The worse part is the hurt in your heart! I am 23 years old, i had my abortion at 15 and i still cry about my baby. Jus think of the other options before you go that route, i understand you saying that bringing a baby into this world right now wudnt be the right thing. Talk to sumon about adoption, or even foster care as well as gaurdianship, there are pple who will take the baby in until you are old enuff and fit enuff to raise it alone. I have gaurdianship of my best friends daughter, weigh you options sweetie.

Just remember to do what you think is best. If you think you can't give the baby a good life then that's your desicion. A lot of religious and conservative nuts will tell you horrible things. Just remember that most of them were never in your situation and will never know what it's like to make this decision. It shouldent hurt very much. Just remember to think positively. You can have children later and give them a wonderful life. <br>  <br>  It depends on where you go as to how theyll do it. Do some research and find out which way your most comfortable with.  Some ways are better than others. Just make sure not to wait too long. After a certain amount of time you can't get an abortion anymore.<br>  <br>  I wouldent tell anyone else if I were you either, actually I would delete this question too. Your just going to hear a lot of opinions that hurt you. Talk to your parents and doctor. Theyll give you better opinion than these people will. Don't tell anyone except them if you don't have too. It'll be easier that way.|`|K6XZ18uHaa	there are probably a lot of people who feel sorry for you, but i'm NOT one of them!  i'm 14 also and we have a word for people like you, slut.  some people probably think "oh, poor baby has to chose to kill this poor little thing" but no you had sex, you knew the risks and did it anyway.  i'm not saying you're the one to blame, he was in on it too, the man whore!  and its a baby! a one day, breathing, cute, little, helpless baby! and you are going to KILL it!   i know this must be a difficult decision for you to make, but don't have an abortion just because you're scared of what others will think!  have an abortion if you can't give this baby a good life.  you could give it up for adoption, just PLEEEASE reconsider!|`|9zwSclnLaa	You have the option of either being put down or just having local anesthesia which will numb you from the hips down.  You are going to get a lot of hate for this question but this is the decision for you and don't let them change your mind for you :)<br>  <br>  It shouldn't hurt and you won't take a lot of time to recover.  Should be ready to go home right after.  If you aren't, they will probably have a room where you can lie around and rest until you are ready to go home.|`|I8nIewQHaa	Your still in your first trimester so it won't be that bad. Look if you go into it thinking you are making a horrible decision then trust me your going to feel worse later. Just like when woman give birth and are depressed after, it happens when you have an abortion also. Please have protection next time you decide to have sex.|`|0TEvBSQyaa	Your going to have a surgical abortion, where you get put to sleep and they basically 'pull' the baby out or dislodge it.<br>  I was 14 when i got pregnant and had an abortion although i had a medical and it hurt SO MUCH. You are basically giving birth! But with surgical it wont hurt as much as you will be put to sleep, but you will bleed for about a week. Try not to be scared. Think positive and get it done asap!|`|i3pn4jNcaa	it depends on what method they give you. theres a pill abortion that you take that basically gives you a misscarrige. it hurts alot but i think its better than getting the surgical abortion. sitting there watching them suction it out of you. your going to be thru alot of pain but if its for the best then do it. i hope you feel better & learned your lesson.|`|7ad5cc0b1e1e9c33fffe4554cf26af75aa	Have you considered adoption before abortion? Hopefully this decision has been really thought through. Wherever you have decided to get the abortion done, will be able to help discuss it. I can pretty much say it will be painful, physically and emotionally. Good luck finding out more Information...|`|TLFbGpviaa	i wouldn't know because i've never had one. but i would think that it's not comfortable and may hurt a little. i'm not going to judge you because i know how you feel. i'm 15 also so i know your too young to take care of a child and you won't be ready for childbirth. it's your body, your deicion, <br>  <br>  so everyone who's bashing her bugger off. what would you do if you were in her shoes? and everyone saying adoption, wth? she'd still have to HAVE the baby and somehow i think giving up a baby is even harder than aborting it.<br>  <br>  my heart goes out to you. gd luk x :)|`|L3hVnjaFaa	You're a murderer. Why don't you put it up for adoption so a couple who have been trying to have a baby for years and failed can raise this baby and make themselves so happy rather than a 14 year old slut like you sleeping around getting themselves pregnant and then just killing the baby.|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	No, it shouldn't hurt if you're getting it done professionally and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

AA11920812	Yes, it is entirely possible that your pregnancy will be healthy. I had a molar pregnancy and five months after my d&c I had a perfectly healthy pregnancy. I was scared the whole time, but my doctors were wonderful at monitoring me.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to find a doctor who babies you. Someone who cares about your feelings. And, when seeing your concern will work to aleviate that. Not all obgyns are created the same so this may take some work on your part. You can google obgyns in your area and google.com has some reviews you can look at. Or, ask around your neighborhood.<br>  <br>  My doctor gave me an ultrasound straight off the bat. The first visit he scooted everyone out of the ultrasound room and let me see the babe. It was great. And, any time I got scared he`d let me take another look at an appointment.<br>  <br>  This is my third pregnancy and that ob had to close his practice. The insurance was just too high to justify continuing. He sent his patients to another ob...who I met last week. Have to say, I am still looking for that great ob...again.<br>  <br>  <br>  ---- Edit to respond to the person who posted an article----<br>  <br>  I hate when people do that. When they post an article about something they know NOTHING about. <br>  <br>  I had the condition. I was seen by my doctor the WHOLE time. He was and is a reproductive endocronologist a specialist in the area on pregnancy. And, pregnancy problems. Which is why people come from the tri-state area to see him. I know women who come into town for weeks at a time just to have him be their fertility doctor.<br>  <br>  Each case is different but waiting a year to get pregnant again is extreme. <br>  <br>  If people don`t know about the condition why do they even have to post? Just say you don`t know...sheesh.|`|02SG8Dchaa	um you should read this..... <a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/pregnancyloss/a/aa072599_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/pregnancyl...</a>
AA12133373	Go to the store and get a home pregnancy test and take it.  Your symptoms sound like pregnancy but only a pregnancy test will tell. And if you do not want to get pregnant use a better form of birth control than pulling out.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	My mother-in-law had her tubes grow back after she was fixed, so yes it is possible. Keep testing.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Possible, but there's probably something else going on.  It's best to go see a doctor.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	well it could be something else because usually they do a pretty good job "fixing" you, unless the doctor that was called it was out drinking all night and came in 3 sheets to the wind and botched the job. Well if you are pregnant you can sue the doctor who did your surgery = ^ ) babies cost money as im sure you know.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	well i know my aunt had her tubes tied and then her husband went and got a vasectomy and somehow my cousin STILL ended up happening. how late are you? i was 4 days and got a negative it wasn't positive till i was almost 2 weeks late!|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	I have heard of it happening but normally not so long after ..like the woman I know had just got it done ..take another test in a week but youmay just have a flu ..
OHq5gSjJaa	The only way that his eyes will stay blue is if his father possesses a recessive blue eyed gene.  Do you know if the baby's father has a parent or grandparent with blue eyes?  If yes, than there is a possibility your baby's eyes could stay blue.  Otherwise his eyes will change to brown, since that is the dominant gene.  Not all babies are born with blue eyes, but many are.<br>  <br>  Edit:  <br>  You are getting a lot of different answers so I just wanted to give you a very simplified idea of how genetics works.  Everyone has 2 genes for eye color.  You get one gene from your mother, and one gene from the father.  This combination of 2 genes determines what eye color you have.  In order to have blue eyes, you must have 2 blue eye genes, because blue eyes are the recessive gene.  If you have one brown eye gene, and one blue eye gene, you will have brown eyes because brown is the dominant gene.  So in your example, we know for sure that your baby has at least one blue eyed gene.  (Because you have blue eyes, we know that you have 2 blue eyed genes, so that is all you can pass on to your son.)  We know for sure that the babies father has at least one brown eyed gene since he has brown eyes.  The mystery is whether he has a recessive blue eyed gene, or whether he has 2 brown eyed genes.  In order for him to have a recessive blue eyed gene, he must have someone with blue eyes in his gene pool.  If he does not have a parent or grandparent with blue eyes it is pretty safe to say that he has 2 brown eyed genes, so that is what he will pass on to your son.  So your son would have one brown eyed gene, and one blue eyed gene, and therefore would have brown eyes.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|yVAdjc6caa	I've heard that the blonde hair/blue eye gene is dominant. So I think they probably will. Usually babies that will have brown eyes are born with brown eyes especially when they are black or bi-racial. A friend of mine has blonde hair and blue eyes and her husband is black and they gave a blonde haired blue eyes little girl. So yes it is very possible!|`|AwvWBROlaa	I daughter is asian and she was surely NOT born with blue eyes. haha anyways my neighbor had a baby boy and his eyes were the prettiest blue eyes ever! She too was hoping his eyes to stay blue. ( she had dark brown eyes almost like mine and husband had clear lightest blue eyes)  If i remember correctly her pediatrician told her its not for sure until baby hits 6 months. His eyes stayed blue but lighter blue like his father. it sometimes changed color to light green. hope this helps =)|`|BGeULTx0aa	yes, all babies are born with blue eyes.  the chances are really up to u and ur history. my mom and her entire family have brown eyes , and my dad has blue with his entire family brown. I have blue and it was very odd considering my background.Its really all about family history. I havent seen to many biracial people with blue eyes, but u never know !good luck|`|lKXtfYFxaa	A lot of Caucasian babies are born with blue eyes but not all.  Dark is dominate but you never know.  <br>  <br>  My youngest daughter is 1 and has a mixture of gray/blue/hazel eye color and she's mixed.  I have dark brown & her dad has blue.<br>  <br>  My friend's babies both have very light blue eyes and they're also mixed.  The dad is from Africa and the mom is white with brown eyes!  The kids look just like the dad (other than the coloring) in case someone was wondering.  <br>  <br>  Genetics is such a big mystery.|`|y6Myl0Imaa	im pretty sure the will my nephews eyes are green hes hispanic hes past the age of one and they are still green depends on his mood though sometimes they are green and then switch to like a hazel kind of color|`|lGcpXteaaa	No, not all babies are born with blue eyes. My daughter was born with grey and now they turned sparkling blue. I have blue eyes and my partner has dark brown.<br>  Shes is not 1 yet but i hope they stay blue...i have got a feeling they will though..|`|3klIx1Egaa	im not sure of the chances, but my 4 mnth old bi racial baby still has bright blue, and his daddies are brown as well :)

Please keep us all posted.|`|bWyKAFwuaa	Well when you take a test in the morning the saturation of HCG in the urine is higher, throughout the day it gets less and less as the urine gets more diluted.....YOU ARE STILL PREGNANT!!!!!

If you had a lot of water or liquids before you took the second one, it would dilute the sample.  Don't be discouraged!|`|uNRvZWifaa	its still a pos. test it's not uncommon for it to be faint|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Your pregnant...if you are still paranoid go get a blood test....a blood test is the only way to get a 100% answer|`|vcxdTXbraa	Oh you are pregnant for sure!!!!

c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	Hold her close, look into her eyes rock to and fro, sing very quietly,rubbing her back gently with your finger tips, keep the same rhythm, lights low.keep all this going at the same time it confuses the brain and all she can do is switch off and sleep.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	That's so nice of you to help out your mum!<br>  <br>  Make sure she's well fed, warm, clean nappy. Then put her down in her crib, sing her a lullaby or tell her a story, then say night night and leave her to it.<br>  <br>  She might cry for a few minutes, but a lot of babies cry for a few minutes as a wind down before sleep. Check on her every 4/5 minutes, make sure everything is ok. If she's tired and fed, I'm sure she will go to sleep in no time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|caExWxHbaa	get some ear plugs lol just kidding.    but you can't really MAKE a baby go tp sleep.  It's part of them being babies.  They should adjust to the times soon.|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	Have her watch TV, sing, or my personal favorite is driving them around the block.|`|TuIrAXLkaa	Be firm do the lullaby tell the story and when your done tell her goodnight and kiss her and leave the room if she cries and tries to come out of bed put her back if she kicks and has a fit sit on the floor indian style with your head down and your back in a slump position do not look at her let her scream and cry if she gets up put her back in bed and return to the floor in the slump indian style position with your head down not looking at her it will take about a week or two and she will start going to bed and staying in bed with her little toy till she falls asleep. saw this on nanny 911 the child always wants to remain good company and if she thinks shes making you sad she will stop and that is the reason for the slump positioning of your body.|`|8KhD8MPBaa	just sit in front of the tv with her just have a hug and she'll drop off to sleep eventually :)|`|7pDHzzszaa	put her in a sleeper hold till she taps out.|`|AA10328947	rum|`|C4ibOR7Laa	when i babysat my nephew i sat him in front of the tv and put it on low, he was asleep within 5 minuets|`|lGcpXteaaa	Rocking or swaying is usually good. <br>  To get my daughter to sleep, i usually just sway her slowly or put her in her rocking chair.

cezaZQQsaa	Take it slow. Don't make a move on him so quick. Since he knows that you just broke up with your boyfriend barely a week ago, he might think that you're just using him as a rebound. Also, you may even want to try waiting for him to make a move on you. You know, let him be the chaser. I know its hard waiting around because you like him a lot and want things to move faster, but remember: all good things to those who wait. Plus, it really does seem like he likes you if he's always texting you and calling you gorgeous and stuff. Just give it some time. Guaranteed, eventually he's gonna make a move ;)|`|82PkTDwwaa	I'd be taking it slow, Get to really know and enjoy this new guy! :)|`|NYJgiVxraa	do not rush. rush = mess. take it little by little. its worht it in the end. do not b taking off ur clothes and messing around until u r ready and stable. trust me.. too many people get hurt by rushing this type of behaviour.
3klIx1Egaa	babies have an automatic sucking instinct until about 6 months, usually after that its a habit, but at then it still is for security.. if after 3 yrs or so, id say it would be insecurity|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I never saw it as either of those things. I always just saw a baby being a baby. Some suck their thumbs. It's their thumbs, and if they want to suck it for what ever reason (insecurity or self soothing), then let him/her.|`|lGcpXteaaa	How is it insecurity? I havent heard that before actually.<br>  It feels good for them, its a comfort thing and a habit. I wont allow my daughter to suck her thumb though. She stuck her thumb in at 6 months and i replaced it with a dummy. At least i can take away the pacifier when she is ready, unlike the thumb!<br>  <br>  I just see it as a comfort habit though...|`|8yTP3jO8aa	For my son, the two sometimes go hand in hand.  He sucks his thumb as a self soothing tactic, left over from his baby need to suck, and his need to find some way to fall asleep by himself.  He learned to suck his thumb to sooth himself to sleep.  Now that he's older and doesn't rely on that as his only way to fall asleep, he also relies on it when he feels insecure.  If we take him to nursery at the church and he is sleepy, grouchy, and shy, he'll suck his thumb because he feels a little insecure.  But, I still believe, even in these cases, that it is a self soothing mechanism.  He feels uncomfortable, so he does something comfortable to sooth himself.   I don't think thumb sucking ever really is just an insecurity issue, since it's done to provide comfort.|`|H6QkoukSaa	I think little kids and babies sucking on anything is self soothing. Usually when they have insecurities they want their parents of other close caregivers or end up with a bit of separation anxiety. Once the child gets to be over 2, I think it is a habit, and needs to start being broken as thumb sucking can be harder to break than a dummy/pacifier.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	All three of my girls suck their thumbs. My oldest is two and its her way to self sooth herself. She use to suck her thumb and a pacifier but we got rid of that.<br>  <br>  I agree with Mama Mia about thumb sucking being a security thing.|`|AA10368053	I'd say its a comfort thing. My son is almost 4 and he only sucks his thumb when he's really tired sometimes he even goes to sleep without sucking his thumb. But he has to have his satin pillow case and even shirts that have satin tags he will carry them around and suck his thumb when he's sleepy. My 2 month old wont suck his thumb or a binky he has to have a bottle to go to sleep I only make him like an ounce when I know he's tired.

It is important to maintain a good atmosphere for the students. and just to comfort you- if your bully ends up harming you, she can allways be sued it is pretty much illegal to assault others. and your 15 correct? which means shes above the legal age to be arrested, so she would be arrested if she tried anything, dont worry. I really hope things work out because even though you dont think it school is important it determines your future! dont let your future get all messed up just because of a bully!(sorry if my english isnt that good)

AtnRHgBxaa	It sounds like that horrible winter virus.<br>  My daughter had it, she didn't eat for two days and when she drank milk she just vomited it back up within minutes. <br>  It only last 24-48 hours though, just keep giving her lots and lots of water.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I would guess it's a bug. My son is just getting over a tummy bug, he is 11 months as well. His was bad enough for a hospital trip though. It's going around really bad. I was told at the hospital that it's strong right now and has been known to last up to 2wks in babies. My son was throwing up for 4 days and now on day 5 is still sleeping a lot. He acted pretty normal the first day. He would fuss a bit, get sick, then play like nothing happened.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	It sounds like a viral infection. Food poisoning usually becomes symptomatic within 4 hours of consuming the contaminated food and can result in frequent vomiting (sometimes once every 30 minutes or less). The gestational period of most intestinal viruses is 2-3 days, so it sounds about right that the other members of your family caught it a couple of days later. Definitely keep an eye on your baby - my daughter was recently hospitalized for dehydration from having a Rotavirus. If she hasn't vomited in 3-4 hours, start giving 1 ounce of pedialyte every hour. If she keeps that down, you can move up to 2 ounces every 2 hours. If, after 8-10 hours she doesn't seem better, seek medical attention. Good luck, hope she feels better.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I would definitely keep an eye on your kiddo, and if you see any signs of dehydration to take her in immediately to the hospital/ER.  But if she seems to be doing okay otherwise, it might just be a touch of the bug that you all seemed to get.  Just keep an eye on her, and if you feel uneasy, I would take her in to the doctor to rule out everything else.  It's better to be safe than sorry!  I hope you all are feeling better soon!
D0M2AXTGaa	Place the receiving blanket on a flat surface. <br>  Fold one corner of the blanket down leaving a flat surface at the top of the blanket. <br>  Lay the baby down on the blanket, head facing towards the flat corner. The flat side of the blanket should be under the baby's neck and even with the baby's shoulders. <br>  Gently place the baby's arm towards the baby's side and gently hold the arm down. <br>  Pull the blanket across the arm and tuck the blanket under the baby on the opposing side. <br>  Tuck the blanket around the baby's feet by placing the corner of the blanket towards the baby's head.

Fold one top corner down and across her body, holding baby’s arm straight at her side, and tuck it under her. <br>  3 - Fold the bottom corner on the same side up. <br>  4 - Now fold the other top corner down, holding her second arm at her side, and pull it snugly to about the middle of baby’s chest. <br>  5 - Bring the bottom of the blanket up and across your baby’s body, wrapping it snugly. Notice that your baby’s legs can still flex and move, but her arms are held still.<br>  <br>  <br>  The easiest way to remember that is DUDU (down,up,down,up)<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Also, here is a video that shows you how to do it.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5pSIeeHeo8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5pSIeeHe...</a>|`|46tTmMT7aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=how+to+swaddle+a+newborn&aq=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_ty...</a>|`|8f750d62dccc0ed47bbfd1a3bf25c4beaa	make the shawl or blanket into a triangle put baby on the middle with the point pointing downwards......bring 1 side across baby and put under it's arm and round the back then do the same with other side so it looks like baby moses...not too tight though just enough to let the baby feel as if your holding it.......nurse the baby to you closley let it smell you and nuzzel it closley until asleep(singing is good) i liked "you are my sunshine" then when baby is asleep put in cot or baby basket on it's side with a blanket rolled up at the baby's back to keep it from rolling over...as it's still swaddled it will sleep peacefully as it thinks your still holding it........some people dont like to put babies on side it's entirly up to you......but congratulations and good luck..........my source is that i have had 6 children all reasonably close together and swaddled them and breast fed them all.......xx liz|`|8RCOlWdMaa	Why would you want to swaddle him? Just cuddle him in a warm blanket/shawl but make sure that the blanket will not ride up over his face to impede his breathing.

He was so strong he would come right out of it.|`|N8cAwzxzaa	It's basically where you snuggly hold their arms crossed over their chest.  Fold your blanket into a triangle, lay baby so his/her head is just below the long folded edge so you can fold it over like a hood, and then pull the two corners in and down to wrap around baby. You want it snug so it won't fall off, but obviously no cutting off circulation.

It is much cheaper than an actual birth.<br>  <br>  When we got everything in order we had a kid.<br>  <br>  Even though I could afford a few more kids I stoped at one because I feel that I had the perfect baby the first time and we could not have a better one and I could never love anyone as much as him and it is not fair to love one kid more than the other.<br>  <br>  If more people were like you and I the ecconomy would be much better and there would be much less suffering.  It is food stamps, medicaid and wic that raise the prices of everything for people that can afford it because supply goes down demand goes up and encourges people to live like this because the government will back them up.<br>  <br>  If we did away with these things people would not have as many neglected/undercared for babies and the price of everything would go down for people like us.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I wasn't going to answer at first but then I saw something Brewer said:<br>  "Birth control is cheaper than the actual birth." That's the truth! <br>  <br>  People can handle different amounts of kids. I know families with 6+ kids and others with none or just one. They are all great families. The number of kids doesn't matter, the parent's just need to be able to care and provide for them fully, without tax-payers help. I agree that, if a family cannot afford a child, they should not have one.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Octo-mom? lets give that i rest and hope she gets hit by a bus and those kids get taken away.|`|sjUNb9zXaa	Isn't there more important things in world to worry about then this stupid *** woman?|`|22eb312dbb14b4b8f995bc33606eb782aa	Octo-mom suffers from a psychological illness.  She says she loves children so much...her language is obsessive, imagine if you were listening to the same kind of talk about say, manhole covers.  We would assume that something is off with this person.  Also, then why not work in a daycare center? Its not children she loves, its her ability to have them. This is a damn selfish reason to have a kid. The story makes me want to hurl, but I don't blame her really,  can you think of anything else she could have done that would have garnered the kind of attention she is currently getting?  This problem is common to many women.  Women are not given props and positive gains often enough for say, running corporations (the words cold hearted b*tch comes to mind) or for doing anything else that does not concern children.  She is instead told to stop, "trying to be a man". Simply put, women who have litters are searching for recognition from society for a job well done, and given the limits put on women in any occupation not involving sex or babies, it is often the only way they can get such social approval. Everything in society tells women that those who choose career over mother hood are deviant in some way (unless said career involves sex, taking care of someone, or babies).  Regis once asked Kathy Lee if she thought she was a grown up, she quipped, "of course, I have kids"!  In short, its the only occupation a woman can be sure to excel, that will gain social approval, and where she will never hit a glass ceiling.  If a woman has a solid sense of self worth, the same opportunities available to men in the workplace, as well as a clear social expectation that she is to work doing something besides raising kids, she would be more likely to focus on developing a career that does not involve her uterus.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	It's a vicious cycle.  The problem is a lack of decent school system.   Because of our country's messed up priorities, the majority of kids aren't getting a proper education, so they don't understand birth control and global issues.  Notice it's always the uneducated (poor) people having a billion kids.  <br>  <br>  Those support programs should still be widely available to those who need it, because even people with stable jobs need WIC and food stamps sometimes.

I understand other people were over  but i just need you to know you shouldn't go behind my back and feed them stuff.<br>  <br>  You should yell and scream if things dont go ur way because u have every right to|`|x2mgUMb6aa	you can't shut the gate after the horse has bolted.<br>  your child's welfare is paramount here do what you have to do.<br>  toughen up.<br>  you should have saisd something much sooner regardles of who was present.|`|ma7oJyuzaa	Come on!<br>  <br>  Let him live a little!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT - I totally agree that the child minder should not go against your wishes.|`|02SG8Dchaa	ok so i have the same problem. ok so she prolly doesnt think its a terrible idea because its diluted juice and a little cake. she also has the wrong idea because u saw her do it and let it happen. i was in the same situation and i was like he cant have that cuz its bad for his teeth so if hes hunngry give him this.... i like to give him green beans and apple slices for a snack. yeah together lol. but the thing is bottom line she is watching ur baby and she needs to mind the rules because say he was allergic to doritos lol and she would not have known that unless u told her and u wouldnt need to tell her cuz she is not supposed to be feeding him them. i hope i am making sence, i have tried to be nice but sometimes people dont listen so u kinda have to spell it out for them. to be nice just tell her that there is a new food list even though u already told her and if its not on the list he cant eat it. tell her its reall important and u can even lie about why just to not hurt her feelings,like hehas been having some problems with some foods and u are wanting to avoid them or u are wanting to  see which food caused it. its ur baby honey if u dont stand up for him no one else will. good luck u will prolly have butterflies in ur tummy until its over anyway.|`|hvu6Z8dnaa	Uh-oh!  At least with you its a childminder, someone who you are paying to do as you say and therefore someone who you are totally within your rights to say something to in this situation.  For me, its my childrens grandparents that have absolutely no regard for my rules!<br>  <br>  If I were you I would re-iterate that you dont like him having these treats in a general manner, and if it persists then get tough.  You dont say why he isn't allowed these foods and drinks, but if it is for a behaviour/medical reason then tell her this.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Just restate what you've already said. "I've noticed recently that when I come to pick up my son that he's eating things I've asked you not to give him. I would really appreciate it if you would please respect my decisions when it comes to my child's diet. If there is a party or special occasion coming up I would like it if you told me about the event and asked if it is okay for my child to have sweets." Be firm, but respectful to her and try not to sound accusatory. It's your child and you should have say over what they eat and this person needs to respect the parent's wishes. Maybe ask her what she would have done if she had given your son something you asked her not to because he was allergic to it (whether he is or not, just a what if situation)?|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	I don't know the best answer for this. obviously you have the right to have your child fed in the way you think right, on the other hand, he is spending his time with people who eat the sort of snacks you want him to avoid. the choice is either for them to eat these snacks in front of him but refuse to let him have any,  which might not be good for his psychological good health, or go without themselves.<br>  <br>  So before you go, I think you need to think of a solution that you're happy with, otherwise it might be better just to let it go, or take him to a different minder who lives the way you  want.<br>  <br>  If you're want to go ahead, perhaps make a list of what  he shouldn't have as a 'reminder'.|`|b10aMPdOaa	Your child, your rules.  The childminder should respect that.  You do need to speak to the childminder about this.  What if he would have choked on the crisps??  What if he had an allergic reaction.  Just tell her that your child is NOT and stipulate NOT to have crisps, sweets etc.  If need be, put it in writing, both of you sign it and then if it does happen again you have the proof.   Good Luck|`|4BeKVZsPaa	i'm sorry but just letting the kiddie have cookies and diluted fruit juices etcetera on special occasions, sound a little draconian to me.<br>  have a word with the child minder if you must but ease up a little with what your son is allowed to have. he's a baby and all the things that babies like shouldn't be only for special occasions. moderation is fine if you feel that they are harmful to him but complete a ban seems almost unreal. chill out a little hey.|`|1NK1hK1Taa	Just calmly explain how you raise YOUR child and how you would like the childminder to follow your requests to raise YOUR child using the same rules. You shouldn't need to remind them that you pay their wages, but you should keep it in your mind when you speak to them. Any decent childminder will want to follow your requests. They won't want the bad 'publicity' if you start telling other parents who take their children there how your instructions are being ignored. Maybe theirs get ignored too? Because the next thing the childminder discovers, is they don't have any children to mind...|`|2pxiK9waaa	It wuld be really rude of your childminder to offer her company cake and coffee and offer your child nothing. Would you sit and eat oreos and ice cream in front of him? Probably not. <br>  <br>  I'd be more inclined to say that he is not allowed to have any juice and only one treat per day. That way it's a compromise. If you limit his treats to his birthday and Christmas, he'll be out of control when he gets older and is on his own. He needs to be taught that everything is ok in moderation and that one small portion of a "treat" every day or two is fine. <br>  <br>  The type of food served to your son should have been something that was discussed when you began using her services. You could always say that his GP wants to monitor his food intake for health reasons and that she needs to keep a food log of what he eats. She may be less likely to give him something you don't want him to have if she's keeping track of things.<br>  <br>  If it continues to be a problem that you can't get past, then you need to switch childminders.
KOwzDLPdaa	Its not a dumb idea, its a very practical one.<br>  You could just tell her that it works out best for everyone, and you'll stop crabbing about it and you'll life would be a little easier. I don't see why she wouldn't want to switch with you. The other two are closer in age anyways and have way more in common. <br>  <br>  A 12 year old shouldn't share a room with a 21 year old. There is too much of a difference in lifestyle at that point. She should definitely share with the 17 year old. Or maybe move away from home? LOL|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I think the 21 one year old she live with the 17 year old! Your 9 years apart from Liz and Gracey is only 6 years apart from Liz! Talk to your parents.|`|6HgiNCmqaa	yes it is dumb. but how u convince them is ur choice|`|YXdKmEKjaa	1 Dont say your 12 on a site thats 13 and over =D <br>  2 No I dont think thats a dumb idea<br>  3 Just tell her your getting older and would like a bit of personal space.<br>  <br>  <br>  Talk too your parents about it tooooo .|`|Q8beYUBEaa	find out a secret about her and then say i tell evrybody if u dont switch the room.|`|FDgarm4Zaa	talk to your parents|`|ptsNu1NNaa	i dont think its a supid idea becuase i had to go through the same thing and its really up to you how to get her to switch because i really don't wat kind of personality your sister has|`|a2nqcdqlaa	Its a great idea. <br>  And dont ask her, just do it.<br>  Why would she care?
Ep0CpwDbaa	No, you're not at all wrong here. More than likely the boy's mother was just a little angry at the time. She was probably embarrassed that her son was misbehaving and was a little scared you'd think of her as an incapable parent, and taking it out on you was a way for her to shift the blame. <br>  <br>  Let her cool off a little and explain that you're sorry you punished her son in a manner she doesn't approve of, but it was something you felt was necessary. Tell her that if your children misbehave when they're at her house, she's welcome to punish them if all else fails, and tell her that her son was fine after a time-out, he'd just been a bit worked up. Try not to make her seem like the bad person here, but let her know that you felt it was acceptable here.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	you werent wrong, and i would tell her i wouldnt be watching him anymore until he learned to mind, and if i wasnt allowed to enforce my rules he didnt need to be there anyhow|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I don't think that your punishment was unfair and if she really had a problem with it, she should have told you how she diciplines her children.Its not like you spanked the kid.<br>  <br>  And I do think that this could have been prevented if you put the DVD in your room or out of the way (granted the kid should listen to whomever is watching him/her)|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	nope it was just fine.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	No you're not wrong in the least bit.  Its my rule that kids at my house obey MY rules or get MY punishment.  (Of course I do draw the line at spanking someone elses child as I do occasionally spank my son for serious offenses).  I also encourage parents to discipline my child when he's at there house. (of course this he's only 21 months so that consists only of my sister, my husband's sister, and my parents houses)  You were in no way in the wrong in this situation.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Sticky situation, we have neighbors who appear to be great, they have a bunch of kids and my kids went over to play with them, my daughter who was 6 at the time, hit her head on the driveway, then she ate a bunch of candy and complained of a headache and the neighbor gave her Tylenol!  (mind you, I'm home the whole time, only 10 feet away).  They finally bring my daughter home after she's taken a nap and thrown up at their house.......I figured I couldn't complain really because she was a guest at their house (couldn't complain about the candy) but when I finally realized my daughter had a concussion (when she threw up again and was very sleepy) I ended taking her to the emergency room.  I finally worked up the nerve to call the neighbor and ask her to never give my daughter medicine again because she doesn't know what medicine my daughter might be allergic to.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, my kids don't go over to play anymore.<br>  <br>  So, I think you need to evaluate the situation, if having her kids come over results in her yelling at you about the rules and choices in your own home, then you need to tell them NO thanks.|`|113FoyMFaa	No you weren't wrong.<br>  <br>  That mom just feels embarrassed about the way her kid acted and lashing out on you makes her feel better.|`|AA10556677	You are completely correct.|`|0YDtjp3Baa	i think you were right. you seem like a very nice and fair mom. i wish my mom was as nice as you.<br>  <br>  please answer mine:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aiz5wyAxt_B54r8Eykh8r13sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222124308AAjf9Wj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|6Apou72oaa	Not at all.  And a time-out is a perfectly acceptable way to deal with the situation.  Good grief, it's not like you spanked the kid.|`|88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	Maybe in the future you can tell other parents how you handle discipline. If they have a problem with it, then you probably don't want them there anyway.<br>  <br>  What you did was not unfair. She should have supported you and had the child apologize. I wonder how many other nice neighbors she has done the same thing to!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	No, you are not wrong.  It's your home and your rules.  Your neighbors asked you to babysit, so they should expect their children to abide by the rules.  It's not like time out is abusive, and i would have done it, too.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't watch their kids anymore.  Ever.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	No, you are not wrong, it is your house, those are your rules, and he was being deliberately disobedient.<br>  <br>  You should have asked her exactly how she would punish a child who is repeatedly deliberately disobedient, because you have never had to deal with such a blatantly disrespectful child before!<br>  <br>  She probably won't ask you to watch him again, so it won't matter, but I would bet dollars to doughnuts that she doesn't discipline him at all!|`|hUbNKOTsaa	well, its not like you used physical violence, you asked him nicely twice to not watch the show because it is inappropriate and you only should have asked him once. It was a fair punishment, it wasn't cruel or harsh, its 5 freaking minutes in the corner! big deal! now if you spanked him it would be a different story. but the mother did not say, if he gets in trouble just scold him, if it was my mother she would think that I deserved it if I got punished and wouldn't care, but she would get angry if you yelled at me, she thinks the yelling should be let to the parent. Its not your fault because you dont know what she does for discipline and timeout isnt a horrible, cruel punishment.|`|4RKdkEq5aa	You are not wrong at all.  I think it would have been wrong for you to scold the child since he is not yours.  You are very responsible and mature to discipline a child that is not yours.  Your house your rules.  You go girl!|`|mp3TXe5daa	No you are not wrong, Sometimes parents have a hard time letting other people discipline thier kids. I am sure she will get over it!|`|U0XdcLfCaa	No.<br>  It's your house. Your rules. You were doing her a favor by watching him.|`|Y2CAuhBhaa	No you're not wrong.   It's your house your rules|`|d7RR2gb9aa	No way, you werent wrong at all.|`|CRozjN6vaa	I don't believe you are wrong in any way, shape or form. Lesson learned, before you take charge of your neighbors children or vice versa, be sure you both ( actually everyone involved) knows the rules and consequences. Only then will there be harmony. If you can't agree on rules and consequences you need a taller fence.
91hxNCfWaa	My parents are family people, they would support me if I was pregnant and kept the baby. They'd probably wish it was a few years later and I was more settled down, but either way, they'd be happy for me and help me.<br>  <br>  That's according to my mother :D|`|v9rzGYWoaa	I miscarried at 17 and my parents weren't happy that I got pregnant, I had my first at 19 with my husband and I am 23 and just miscarried again and My parents are still unhappy about the pregnancy.

Personally I like Rylen Summer Parker.
vcATtojoaa	rylan and rayne, although I would spell 'rylan' Rilan or Rilynne, its more femining. Personally my favorite name set for twins would be Lilly & Rose (girls) or Micha & Maria (1 boy, 1 girl) or James & Julian (boys) but maybe those are more traditional than you'd like.|`|7drjpohUaa	I don't like any of them, sorry. And I would suggest not giving them names that start with the same letter or rhyme.

6DNHxcSsaa	I don't see any symptoms of post partum depression.<br>  What I see is a young girl who is not being responsible and who is thinking more about what she wants than what is best for the baby.|`|wqRSMSlLaa	Your sister might have postpartum obsessive compulsive disorder, but of course I cannot diagnose her over the Internet.  In any case, she needs help and should see a therapist who specializes in postpartum mood disorders.  The therapist should be able to outline a strategy for her to recover.  Teens are very high risk for postpartum depression and the other postpartum mood disorders as well.<br>  <br>  Dr. Shoshana Bennett|`|dNGO8m0Gaa	Its a bit hard to say if its postpartum depression, she simply could be very irresponsible. Either way she needs to get some help, if it is postpartum depression it will only get worse with out medical help. If not she needs to realise she is a mother and has responsibilities, if she is not willing to accept this people will have to intervene. Otherwise it is the child that is going suffer whatever the situation.|`|eGwovsk2aa	it sounds like it. just be careful leaving her alone i dont want to scare you but honestly because it seems like she is not connecting emotionally with the child.
YbEQ8Wv5aa	If you said no, it was rape. Even if you didn't say no, but didn't show an interest in it- rape. Talk to your school counselor or someone about this.|`|r39EDGhPaa	You let him do it.<br>  So no, it isn't rape.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	If you let him then it isn't rape, just stupidity on your part.

Having sex because you were pressured into it is not consent.   It sounds like you were lucky and didn't end up pregnant besides.  Think twice about not getting up and leaving if someone started man-handling you again.|`|xPR7g0wFaa	You let him and you put yourself in that position by going back in his room knowing what he had tried in the past.|`|WGAFP6mSaa	If you let him do it but didn't like it, it's not considered rape.|`|p3d3E75oaa	that's considered date rape but you cant prove it sadly|`|IA5zVfk0aa	if you said no than its rape|`|jdf1qVtOaa	yes, if he pressured you into it.|`|m4geUBLTaa	mmm sweetheart i am so sorry. yes this is date rape. i have been there.

But I was raped so not my fault...|`|BUOJJpaCaa	I was 16 and no.|`|OeEaooidaa	I am still a virgin and hope to be for a long time!|`|M2VneBW3aa	im still a virgin and plan to be for a loooooooooooooooooooooong time.|`|o9ewWdX5aa	14, and i only lost it the past valentines day.<br>  look it's not something i'm proud of, yet i don't regret it either.<br>  sex isn't something you should do to be 'cool' or because everyone else is, it's something you should wait for, the right time, right place, right person.<br>  of you have all those things i don't see how you could regret it. just take a look at who you're with and all those other important factors, then see if it will end up being something you'll regret.<br>  <br>  if after all that you still want to, go ahead. just don't get pregnant if you wont be able to care for the baby.|`|hpnZ8awvaa	I had just turned 16 and he was 17 (turning 18 soon).. And no i don't regret it, we are still together, 1 year and 9 months tomorrow, dating since May 2007 :)<br>  <br>  I am almost 18 now and he is almost 20..|`|9rYjpIThaa	i havnt lost mine and G.G omg get someone ur own age and mommy of twins i think u are amazing truly, in a few weeks wish ur twin girls a happy great first birthday, ur going to be a great mom,  Lovebug|`|dbf8Afhoaa	I haven't lost it yet, but when I do, I definitely won't regret it.|`|47790329901dba8887db0c7f8d7b4d1faa	I was 15. I'm 19 now. I regret it a little bit but right now I'm focusing on my fiance and leaving the past behind.|`|x08oohwpaa	16.  I was responsible and safe.  He had been my boyfriend for over a year and we talked about it in detail before hand.|`|8oKazGVGaa	i was 15 and nope dont regret it........ practice makes perfect im pregnant now...... too much practice|`|tjMTiAXoaa	I was 16 and no I don't regret it.|`|FJFO0GPxaa	19.

We were 18- no regrets.
6lG6RqC2aa	The chances are 50%.|`|G6Snxhwmaa	it's not likely, but it couldn't hurt to get the pill. you should be more careful next time.
8c1543nUaa	The baby is growing even though you're not showing, and pushing out you're belly button. It happens to almost everyone.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	im the same lol, im 15 weeks and 1 day, with no baby bump, but iv noticed my belly button is sticking out lol, i thought it was just me|`|91hxNCfWaa	I believe it's because the baby is in there, pushing around, and it kinda pushes the inner part of the belly button out. I could be wrong :P|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I don't know why it pops out, but I do know mine poped out before I was showing. It's really out there now, and looks kinda brusied. =D|`|QI0js7MRaa	i heard it pushes out when the baby starts forming legs and arms and it causes it to push your belly button out i could be wrong
dN5BJeVpaa	Oh I LOVE Phoebe!<br>  It's so whimsical and pretty and ohh it's just lovely. <br>  <br>  I'm iffy about Daylen. I guess I like Daelyn for the spelling, because it's more feminine, but I hate how trendy it is. But I think Dayle would be so cute for a nickname. <br>  <br>  I still say pick Phoebe, it's so underused and fabulous. <br>  Phoebe Celeste sounds posh, and Phoebe Nicole sounds more girl next door.<br>  <br>  I like Phoebe Nicole best.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	1.Don't worry about the friends! It's your baby!<br>  2.If people can't see Daylen isn't day-ellen, they can't read.<br>  3. I love Daylen, it's unique, great job!<br>  4.Daylen Celeste is great! It's not often used, but beautiful.|`|IUFj0QlMaa	i dont like phoebe. <br>  i dont think there are any nicknames to go with that name<br>  <br>  and daelynis pretty:)<br>  but if its too close with dylan,<br>  why not.. Daella (day-ella) or.. Delilah<br>  or.. Daena(day-na)<br>  and phoebe.. what about another p name, <br>  like Payton/Paeton or.. Penelope <br>  <br>  :) hope i helped.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I'm loving Daylen!  It's close to Dylan, but if you love it, use it.  It's not THAT close.  My favorite middle name with it is Daylen Nicole.  I think Daelyn feminizes it a bit, too.|`|F6qbI4UYaa	I like Daylen Nicole. I still do like Dylan better though :P.|`|AA10076709	Daylen Celeste as the middle name isn't as common as Nicole...|`|9vCVbaDRaa	I like Daylen Nicole. It shouldn't matter if your friends son's name is Dylan as long as you like it.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Phoebe Celeste.|`|vcATtojoaa	You could use the old english spelling D?lynne, which is farther from Dylan w/out messing up possible pronunciations. I myself like the combination Celeste Nicole, but D?lynne Nicole sounds nice as well :)|`|AA12058022	I'd mix them. I like Phoebe Daelyn.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	daylen nicole|`|YMoBKBjtaa	Phoebe Nicole is lovely!!!! It's a really great blend of a more unique name and a classic middle name. The flow is perfect and it's great! Hope this helped and best wishes =)|`|7drjpohUaa	I like Daylen, but since your friends son is Dylan, it might be a bit weird. I like Phoebe too, and it's not too common.<br>  <br>  Phoebe Celeste is a very beautiful name, you should pick that one! I also like Phoebe Juliet and Phoebe Celene.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Daelyn Nicole is cute but what do you think of the names Haelyn and Kaelyn? I really like these names and they are similar to the name Daelyn if you like them! Good luck and I hope that I helped. ~I LOVE Derek|`|xpUyH0psaa	i knew someone named daylen but spelled dalynn so maybe you can use lynn at the end to make it look more feminine. daylen nicole is not a bad choice. phoebe nicole will be a second choice.|`|AA10166553	Daylen Nicole
87b6887f8f3651f24e111ac966c0f89daa	You will have pain for a little bit after but if it's severe this could be a sign of something more serious. Depending on how big the blood clots are you could still be passing some of the womb lining and/or faeotus. However, if this is the case you may develop a womb infection as all this should be removed during the procedure at the hospital. If you seek a doctors help with this they should be able to provide you with antibiotics or an option to be readmitted to remove the excess.<br>  <br>  Oh sorry- it's god punishing you , yeah because that's really helpful.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Severe pain = call the nurse line.<br>  <br>  True pro-life people care about ALL human life, including yours. So ignore the negative comments. Your health is the concern right now.|`|pZDVPubIaa	ignor these people! its not normal 2 get it so call doctor cos u shudnt b in pain x<br>  <br>  **edit**<br>  <br>  i just realised u r actually a man, how can u joke about killin a baby come on..! u cant realli think its funny...?|`|C4ibOR7Laa	everything has not came away, and your body's way of trying to get rid of that is to keep bleeding heavy, trying to flush what ever is left out<br>  <br>  the abortion clinic should have gave you a 24hour help line number, i suggest you call that, you may need to go there tonight for an examination or a suction procedure to remove what ever is left as it can cause infections and infertility|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Because it is totally normal.  <br>  No need to worry unless you are using more than 2 pads per couple of hours!|`|IA5SuFkdaa	KARMA FOR KILLING UR BABY! <br>  <br>  <br>  call a doctor.|`|mPTBU0QDaa	I would call a doctor right away, just to make sure this isn't going to threaten your life or future fertility.<br>  <br>  Women to give birth to babies often have pain afterwards and pass large clots - it's like having a really heavy period, and it can last a week or longer.<br>  <br>  So, depending on how far along you were when you had the abortion, your body might be doing similar things to a woman who gave birth. It is probably trying to go back to how it was before you were pregnat.<br>  <br>  I am sorry to hear that you had an abortion. Please be more careful in the future. Abortions kill a baby, and they really can mess up your body.|`|v9rzGYWoaa	After an abortion you shouldnt have blood clots they are suposed to completely clean the uterus. You need to go to a dr.|`|kJDYvqaOaa	Urgh, don't let these people give you crap. A**holes. <br>  I'd call the hospital and ask them to check you out, they'll be able to answer your questions. Feel better soon x x|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I always think 'better safe than sorry' If you don't have medical insureance then call the ER and talk through the phone to get a professional opinion. Be honest with them.|`|cRqCyIdRaa	Go to the doctor, it can be from the abortion, but you can never really tell.<br>  sooo go to urgent care....<br>  ignore the rude comments...<br>  hope your okay....|`|JnnBiFK4aa	its normal....unless the pain is really really really bad|`|da8d3fa7a075907fff1a655c9a107079aa	Call a doctor...that doesn't seem right<br>  <br>  And ignore all the pro lifers...now isn't the time for your opinions.|`|wqrycWlEaa	Why are you asking us this?<br>  You should ask your doctor|`|xocIN0scaa	Well... its not like you just took a pill and cured a headache.. i think that what you are experiencing is to be expected. <br>  I highly doubt it is just plain blood clots. The baby will be expelled, what you are seeing may actually be the baby that was killed. Have a good look so you don't do it next time. In the meantime check out what abortion really is on google or you tube.. they have great clips of what actually happens. It is not all " science and medicine"! One cannot kill another human and expect there to be no blood. <br>  By the way for all you pro-choice people out there.. pro-lifers have a right and an obligation to protect the innocent.. that is all they are doing! They have the right to say what they feel, feelings aside. That poor baby felt something as well..but it was not pleasant as just clicking a button and posting it on yahoo answers.|`|V2P4ajJcaa	I don't think this question is for real (Jimbo), so I'm not going to bother answering it, but I feel compelled to suggest that those who think God punishes women who terminate pregnancies should try actually reading a Bible. In the book of Exodus it is made perfectly clear that an unborn fetus is NOT considered a human being and that ending a pregnancy is NOT considered murder.|`|7hIwM2jzaa	what type of abortion did you have? depending on where you were in the pregancy will depend on what way they did it.<br>  <br>  I had a misscarrage at nearly 4 months and even though i had a D&C i had blood clots after, its you uterus's way of cleaning itself out|`|dNGO8m0Gaa	It is normal to have pain and bleeding after this, If it has been more than a day since you had this I would call the doctor. In saying that, if you are worried about anything why not call one anyway, just to to put your mind at ease.|`|TNXQbg4Saa	You really need to call a doctor. You could have an infection.<br>  <br>  Ignore those who are putting you down. <br>  <br>  Best of wishes.|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	Oh Jimbo..<br>  <br>  The name says it all doesn't it guys? Unless we have another pregnant man.. I sense a Troll lurking..|`|eGwovsk2aa	call a doctor
AA11085356	I wouldn't worrie about it. Kids will be kids.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	If they were just swimming I don't see anything wrong with it. Like someone else said, they do seem too old to see each other naked but whatever. As long as they weren't doing anything inappropriate I wouldn't punish them.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Lol. When I was 15, and my sister was 13 we got caught skinny dipping in the pool at 1am by the police - it was really embarassing. <br>  When they knocked on our door, my mother burst out laughing - she thought it was the funniest thing ever. But my dad was mortified. <br>  <br>  I don't know, I don't think it's a big deal. It's your pool, and they're not with other people - its a little off that they're so old and naked around each other, but at least none of them had friends over.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	i would ignore it, it's a bit of fun for them but they will eventually get bored of it. I just wouldn't let them invite their friends over otherwise  you might have some questions to answer from their parents.|`|y9HO1dWsaa	It's a bit too cold for them to be skinning dipping.|`|qHJ6AGp8aa	lol|`|JDJjGdEuaa	ok
