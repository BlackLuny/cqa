Before anyone walks me through the steps of setting a Y!360 picture as my Y!A ava,I wanna say I already know....and,until the past week or so,it had been working fine for me,and I'd change pic every week or 2,whenever it suited me.      But,now,it does not seem to work for me at all.I go to Y!360,and upload a pic I wanna have as my Y!A ava,and then I choose it as Primary.Then,I choose for Y!A to show my Y!360 pic as avatar,but all Y!A ends up showing is my screen name in the place where a picture should show.      What causes that to happen?   And,why can't I seem to have my Y!360 picture as my Y!A ava,anymore?!?

20090203145351AArYyuf	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Ok, I don't understand why people answer someone's question if they don't know the answer?	Ok I know that the whole point to Yahoo Answers is to ask questions so that you can find the answers you are looking for and to solve  problems that others may have. But this is what I don't understand, It's when people go answers other people's questions and even if they don't know the answer to the question, why do they still post an answer that does not answer the question.      Lets say for example, your talking about a computer question and say "Are there any games that are like Dance Dance Revolution for the computer and if so that is the name of the program?". And someone may answer with a "yes" which is pointless because it does not tell me the name of it, and an "I don't know" means they don't know the answer(so why post an answer if you don't know it?) I guess my point is why do people post answers to anyone's questions if they are half-*** answers that don't provide enough detail to give an answer or why post a question when you don't know the answer?
