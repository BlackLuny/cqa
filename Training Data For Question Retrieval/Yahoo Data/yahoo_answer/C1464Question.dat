20090220133740AARx9ql	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How can someone believe in God and Jesus and NOT believe in Aliens and Ghosts?	I mean.. come on! If no one has actually seen God or Jesus but still says they have existed/do exist, than how can you say that ghosts don't exist.. because people have actually seen them.. there are numerous stories. And don't get me started on aliens.. there has to be some other sort of life out there. Wouldn't be too surprising!      But maybe for a better question, which of "those" do you believe in?
20090220134036AA1UJ5V	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is this a weird reason to NEVER eat anywhere but from home again?	Well, I was in line for lunch and when the lunch lady gave me my food, I looked and it's like "Tyra...." and she looked and bursted out laughing and so did I b/c we both saw the dead, medium roach on his back stuck to the side of my tray. I carried it really weird all the way back to my seat.       Then I got really dizzy and nauseous and I showed my friend Dillon who (he's a character) starts yelling in his ghetto "gangster" voice "There is a ROACH on Abbeh's TRAY-- CLEAN IT UP!!!" in the middle of the cafeteria. My name isn't spelled like that, that's just the way he said it. Then he runs up yelling the same thing and throwing the tray in the incredibly Assistant Principal's FACE!!! So the A.P. took me to show the lunch ladies and replace my food and I was thinking "Do you really expect me to eat that?" but I took it graciously and sat down and played with the food with my utensils and laughed and called it rat brains. And so Dillon was like "At least my food is some good rat brains!" and I told him that his food looked like gremlin turds. It was sooo gross. So I threw my food away and didn't eat ANYTHING for lunch, even though, surprisingly I didn't get that hungry.        I'm already a germaphobe so now this incident just ruined all chances of my not being afraid of germs...      Do you think that's gross, on a scale from 1-10?    Would you have eaten the food?       And should I NEVER eat anywhere but home again? And also, not ever let my children if I ever have any eat anything from school? I am just like scarred for life b/c that's nastyyyyy!!!      Also, what is the nastiest thing you've ever seen in your food or school cafeteria/restaurant?

I'm very confident in my abilities, but I like to keep a very small group of extremely close friends. Plenty of people know me, but i dont want to hang out with them that much that i want to with my close friends.      Been in a couple of relationships before. I had to call off my last relationship, because the girl wanted to have sex with me.      I would love to have extremely close friends that i can hang out with frequently, but i dont want to be clingy. I like to have a bit of personal space too.      I have some very close friends right now. But now they're in very clingy relationships, so i cant hang out as much. I would love to have a friend whose single, and we can just be soul-mates. Hang out, have a fun time. I dont want to be in a gf-bf relationship right now, cuz my last gf and i just broke up recently. Am i asking a bit too much?

I think that you must tell your mother about your problem, because if not the consequence of that will be that the crowd kids will continue irking you and hitting you.      Your mother can go with you to talk with the school manager/principal, and the he will punish the kids and solve the problem.       I hope I could help you and talk with those kids.

20090220140650AAjggM4	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Problem with a Close Friend?	So since I've started my first year in college back in August 2008 I've met a wonderful friend. Her and I immediately clicked and we became best friends pretty much in a month of knowing each other.      The problem with my friend and I is that she really likes me and I know this because she's told me. Recently I've noticed she's been absent-minded, so I've asked her what is she thinking about, she's told me a few times that it's about me. I'm not really shocked that she likes me, we're really great friends. But I don't know how to tell her that I'm gay, I need to tell her before she is really too hooked on the idea of me and her dating.    I really want to keep her as my friend but telling her I'm gay is something I've been fearing as I have no idea how the outcome will be. I'd prefer not telling her something like "no I'm not interested" or something because I feel like it'll tell her that no she's not good enough for me, or I feel that is what she'll get from me telling her that I'm not interested.

I don't get how christians can sit there and say all these things about harry potter being evil, or wiccans being evil for doing magic, but then they read the bible and half of it seems "magical". I mean Moses splitting a river in half today to christians would be seen as magical right? therefore evil... But yet they sit there judging others for their beliefs and there beliefs in voodoo and magic but the bible has many components of "magic" in it.       This is not intended to all christians, just to the religious fanatics like the women on trading spouses who thought she was "gods warrior", omg that was funny lol And i know ppl like that too. No but for real, I know not all Christan's are like this and just follow the bible and pray, like my grandma bt i can never get the christians who judge psychics and magic, when the bible contains many magical scenes in it, yet they bide to this as a reason of fate.       But anyways before you thik im complete atheists im not i believe in my own religion and think tht all religions are beautiful in their own way and its the people who ruin religion. I prefer buddhism as it is peaceful  bt i like to apply some components of islam,hinduism, and christianity in my life as well as animism. Thts just my belief.

20090220143435AAK3xjs	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Lgbt Can You Help Me With A Problem With A Friend?	My best friend has a little sister who is 15 who I am strangely quite close to.. well not close, I have known her for a long tim (through my best friend and I guess she trusts me.) So yeah, the three of us were sitting watching the TV the other day, when my best friend goes upstairs to have a shower, so it was just me and her sister in there alone.    All of a sudden, she turns to me and goes "your bisexual, how did you know?" So I explained to her about it the best I could and then she said that isnt sure about her sexuality. She is still a virgin and she said that she has never had a crush on anyone at all nor has never felt an attraction towards anyone (male or female) She also said she has never masturbated... well she didnt actually just say it.. she went "I have never.... *raised eyebrows* you know..." So yeah, thats what I perceived it as.   So I just kinda said that she was only 15, there was no need to try and rush to figure herself out or anything.. I didnt really know what to say to her.    What do you think I should say next time she talks to me about it? I dont want to just keep saying to her, just wait.. because I have already said that.    Could it be possible that she is asexual? I know that is really rare, but is there a slight chance?      Oh and I asked her why she wasnt talking to her sister about this and she said that she didnt want to tell her because she knew that she would her parents and they would think she is a freak. I dont know why though, I have always thought that her and her sister have had a really good relationship. Honestly, she seems a bit scared about the whole thing..       Anyway, help would be greatly appreciated :)   Thanks.

But you're starting to discover more about her thru the internet and her facebook page. You've learned that she is extremely close to her family, has a silly, somewhat outgoing side (which is conveyed thru pictures and videos), she is kind of corny, is assertive when it comes to values and beliefs that are important to her, is very insecure about herself and also has serious fears about her health.      She's still extremely shy in public yet she will voluntarily send you a message or two online / thru a text. What would u think of her after discovering the other sides she reveals online?

I'm 15 so give me a break from anything that's just ignorant/radical. Here goes.       If atheists don't believe in any higher power then how do they (you) think humans came to be? Do atheists tend to turn to science (as in the Big Bang theory) or just not question it at all? I mean the deeper question here would be what made us? If it was the Big Bang, what made that? And that? etc...      Just curious that's all. I like different perspectives on things in life.

Matthew 6:9 ....here are several translations        International Standard Version    "Therefore, this is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.      New American Standard Bible    "Pray, then, in this way: 'Our Father who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name.      GOD'S WORD? Translation    "This is how you should pray: Our Father in heaven, let your name be kept holy.      King James Bible   After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.      NWT   9 “YOU must pray, then, this way:    “‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.      Cross references    Eze 36:23    23 I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Sovereign LORD, when I show myself holy through you before their eyes.    EzE 38:23..... And so I will show my greatness and my holiness, and I will make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD.'      Comments (from the Peoples New Testament)   After this manner therefore pray ye. The Savior does not bid us use these words, nor command any set form, but gives this as a proper example of prayer, simple, brief, condensed, yet all-embracing.      Our Father which art in heaven. These words reveal a very tender relationship between God and the true worshiper, and base the petition on the fact that the child speaks to the Father.      Hallowed be thy name. Of the seven petitions of the Lord's prayer the first three are in behalf of the cause of God: the glory of his name, the extension of his kingdom, and the prevalence of his will. The other four, which are properly placed last, as least important, pertain to our individual needs. No one can offer the first three petitions who is in disobedience. Hallowed : Holy, sacred, reverenced      Are the comments correct ?   Can you add any relevant scriptures or comments ?   Do these words have any impact on you personaly ?   Do all the different translations mean the same thing ? If not which has the most meaning to you & why ?
20090220151520AAIwXYD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do Jehovah's Witnesses believe about Jesus Christ?	I heard that Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in the "three distinct persons" in one being/essence/substance Trinity that many Christians believe in, or that Jesus is Divine, but that Jehovah's Witnesses believe Jesus is the Savior & Redeemer of the World, the Son of God, the Creator.  Is what I heard true? I'm trying to make sure I understand peoples' beliefs correctly.      I also heard that Jehovah's Witnesses "believe that they center their religion around Jesus of Nazareth", and that's why they consider themselves to be Christians, although they believe the Father or Jehovah is the only one we should worship.  Is this true?      I'm just trying to clear some things up.  Although I'm not a Jehovah's Witness, someone's telling me that Jehovah's Witnesses are not Christians, and I think that they probably are, well at least part of the World Religion Christianity since I always see them listed in those Christianity family of denomination charts.  The main argument the person I'm having a discussion with is that Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe they center their religion around Jesus of Nazareth, and that Muslims believe Jesus was a prophet who wasn't Divine and so that makes Muslims just as much Christian as Jehovah's Witnesses.      I want to make sure I understand others' religions correctly.  Any help would be appreciated.  Also, any references to what Jehovah's Witnesses believe about Jesus Christ/Jesus of Nazareth would be helpful.

So I'm pretty sure everyone already know about the situation with Chris Brown and Rhianna, but I want to know what are your thoughts on the people that say that they don't like Rhianna and so she deserved it, that think that Chris shouldn't go to jail, that think he should have done worst to her, that claim is ok for a man to hit a woman.      To make this question clear, I'm not asking about Rhianna and Chris, I'm asking about the people that make those comments about them.      And those comments come from women and man.      I personally think is a shame about these people, imo they are sad and pathetic and these women probably have such a low self esteem if they would let a man hit them, they probably think they don't deserve better. And the men...well they can be call men. These people are a disgrace to the human race.
20090203042442AAeteUF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can ?reason? and ?faith? go hand in hand? Come on!?	These 2 have always been the most powerful philosophical enemies since the birth of mankind. If there's a little faith in your reason, your rational thinking is screwed and intellectually dishonest. And if there's a little reasoning in your faith, be honest, you're disregarding your faith. Christians keep claiming that reason and faith are not mutually exclusive, but they never ground that claim. I think there couldn't exist anything more mutually exclusive that ?thinking? and ?not thinking?, cause by definition ?faith? is to deliberately abandon your desire to undergo every single form of rational thinking.
20090203045224AAlIz96	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Let's settle this: ?reason? vs. ?faith?. round 1.fight!?	I've noticed that one of the major problems while debating religious belief is the lack of consistency there is regarding the definition of of the term ?faith?. It even means different things at different times, always fitting the believer's convenience, apparently. One way to settle this --won't be easy, but someone has to do it-- is agree on one and only one definition. My definition has always been the same:   ?embrace the belief in a preposition with 100% certainty in the face of zero evidence or conflicting evidence?.    So I don't apply faith to believe the sun will rise tomorrow. I've seen it rise before, and it's rational to think it will do that again. Because inference and deduction are part of our logical thinking, and it's rational to use them. Nevertheless, there's no 100% percent certainty in reason. But there is conviction and certainty without seeing in ?faith?.   Do you agree with my distinction? What is your own definition of ?faith?. Thank you.

20090220145819AAWmiAq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Use intellectual thinking, not brainwashing, when answering?	A lot of people mention Jesus had "hair the color of wool" (meaning any race other than Black) to  as opposed  to “hair like wool” (referring to texture like Africans.  Remember the country of Egypt is on the continent of Africa)  First I think it’s pertinent to mention the fact that there are over 50 different bibles in the world so I‘ve actually read it both ways.   And I do agree that most historians believe that he was a Jew, but whether he was from Jerusalem (nationality) or just of the Jewish religion it’s believed he was born in a region of the world were people had color.  Some bibles clearly state that the Jews were of dark skin completions.  But nonetheless I don’t think that that is the real question I’d like to throw in the pool of christian belief. The real issue is whether Jesus actually existed at all.  Now I’m not one of those people who doesn’t believe in God, by any means.  However I like to do all of the research,  instead of simply believing what I’m told, and I do know a few things that not only you but whomever taught most of you about Jesus leave out.   Things that you may (maybe not especially if you‘re christian) want to consider if you’re going to spread the idea of Jesus.  Since I could go on for a while I will simply suggest that you do some research on your  own and come to your own conclusion in reference to HORUS.  The “SUN” God (as opposed to the Jesus the “SON” of God.  Both were said:   To have been born on December 25th of virgins   That both births were announced by a star in the east and attended by (Horus: three kings/Jesus: three wiseman)   That at age 12 became teachers of faith (Horus: in the temple/Jesus in the church)   To be baptized at the age of 30 by men who were both decapitated thereafter   To both have had 12 (Horus: helpers/Jesus disciples)   To have resurrected some one (Horus: El Azureth don’t quote me on the spelling/Jesus: Lazarus)   To have walked on water   To have been crucified, buried for three days in a tomb and resurrected      And the list goes on.  Now most W.A.S.P.s (white anglo-saxon protestants) would naturally think that the Legend of Horus was copied from the teachings of YOUR bible.  While you might find it strange that 14 centuries before even the mention of the name Jesus, in the year 1400 B.C. the Luxor temple was constructed in ancient Egypt (coincidentally the same place were most if not all of YOUR bibles stories take place) and the story of Horus is engraved onto the walls.  The way bibles would have had to been written before that wonderful thing we know as paper came along.  I wonder if you’ll respond to this in another video after you’ve done the suggested research.  But alas I’m pretty sure that even if you study the evidence for yourself that you’ll CHOOSE to ignore it because it doesn’t fit into what you WANT  the truth to be.  I hope that I’m wrong because you DID seem to come across very well spoken and open minded on you video, but we shall see.  Keep in mind that most things you’ll read are written by the same people who took the story of Horus and turned it into Jesus (White Europeans, Romans to be precise) so you’ll have to think outside of the box when searching.  Try the “Book of the Dead”.  It’s the ancient Egyptian funerary text (keep in mind that the civilization began around 3000 B.C. long before the time of Jesus). So I close with this…. “Jesus black or white” not the question, but rather HORUS OR JESUS?
20090220152136AAlc6mT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Most people read the first couple of lines then answered...?	the question wasn't whether Jesus was black or not rather simply a starting point to a question.  My question was, "If the legend of Horus IS documented in the Book of the Dead (the ancient Egyptian funerary text) and was carved onto walls of the Luxor temple 1400 years before the birth of Jesus why are there so many similarities.  I haven't decided for myself and would like some non-biased opinions.

20090220152949AAD84ah	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Disproving a negative such as the christian god?	Well, after some intense studying I have come to the conclusion that the Christian god cannot exist due to the fact of the characteristics given to him. In 5 steps I will disprove him.      1. A god is omnipotent, omniscient, and all-benevolent.   2. If a god exists, then there exist no instances of ultimately evil natural laws or processes.   3. The laws of predation are ultimately evil.   4. There are instances of the laws of predation   5. Therefore, no god exists.      If anyone doesn't know the laws of predation are organisms having to kill other organisms in order to survive      Please don't give any excuse like "We cannot understand god's logic" because if we cannot understand his logic then how do we know he sends atheists to heaven and christians to hell. How can we even label god to be all good and can do everything if we can understand his logic, so don't give any excuses like that because that proves nothing.      What our your opinions?
20090220150026AAjsdIT	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What is the difference between being politically incorrect and stereotypical?	You know, such as racism, ageism, sexism, and homophobia, they all seem to be used in both, as analogies to predict false statements of a certain individual as being part of a specific group, no matter what that individual thinks, as it only matters to the person whose predicting the false statements, as a joke, reference, or as to what they may think is true, but is really false to others.  I still don't get what the difference is to being politically incorrect and stereotypical, do they mean the same thing, or do they have different meanings of being prejudice against a certain group or culture?

20090220152201AAr3zR4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the face of God?	simple question; why are we not allowed to look upon gods face?      a friend said that as the power of all creation it would be like looking into a nuclear reactor multiplied by a few zillion.   yet this ascertainment would not explain why we cannot depict gods image, or even worship idols, nor do i think that gods face would be like that. i would also argue that god wouldn’t have a face, if anything god is an infinite being, hence would not have a three dimensional object for a face [and where is the body?].      to quote the bible...      “And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me and live.” (EXO 33:20)      nice chap! i suspect that this is the writing of a power mad crazy religious fanatic, god would not say such a thing. secondly that god [if existent] would not be able to ‘talk’ as he would not have a mouth. whatever communication there is between us and ‘divinity’ would not be via any normal processes.      and a contradiction...      “For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.” (GEN 32:30)      surely anything we can conceive would be a ‘mask’ of god and not god, this notion may also be transferred from the visual to the audible and any other context! what we are left with is the esoteric, mysticism and the like, or at least nothing literal!         thoughts?

I am also  woman, and have found that I don't like working with other women for this reason.  I feel that I am competent and pull my share, if not more, of the work load.  We are both very close friends with our manager, but she has been friends with her longer, and they are, in my opinion closer friends.  I am not jealous or bothered by that in any way, so that is not an issue for me, other than the few times I've tried to delicately discuss this with my manager.  She acknowledges that her friend is a 'super achiever' and just sort of laughs it off as a silly personality quirk.     I realize this is a common office problem, and in all honesty, I wonder if women will ever be able to restrain themselves from nitpicking other women to death.  I am at a point that I never want to work with other women again.

20090220151810AAgaL1O	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Which guy do you think likes me more than a friend?	I need help trying to figure out which one of these guys like me:   Guy #1-Ask about me through other people, for example, my immediate co-worker,through another manager-he asks"So how is so and so doing", everytime he talks to my co-worker George, and everyone else.He's also called up to my job three times asking for my whereabouts and claiming that he wanted to meet me, but never showed. Told me to call him anytime.Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there.   Guy#2   Mostly talks to him over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that".Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.Another thing is the few times I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers..and he hangs up.The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.   Sidenote"These two guys are very good friends..:)

20090220153045AAVS98o	Society & Culture;Languages	Heeelp .. english speakers plz helpppp plzzzzzzzz?	i am writing a formal request for a scholarship, so will you plz check it out for me and see if there are grammatical mistakes or any kind of mistakes or suggestions ... thanx a lot.      I recently learned of the scholarships offered by the department. I am very interested in Geoffrey Leech Scholarships, and I believe I would make an ideal candidate.    The Ministry of Higher Education has offered me a full tuition scholarship to do my Bachelor Degree and the Dean of Foreign Languages Faculty at the University of Jordan, Professor Ahmad Majdoubah, has offered me a full tuition scholarship to do my postgraduate studies at the University of Jordan. However I am sure that studying in the United Kingdom and Lancaster University is going to benefit me greatly as it will enable me to gain valuable life skills and the chance to develop my potential. By studying in the UK; I'll have the opportunity to travel, meet new people, experience new cultures and above all, gain the skills, qualities, confidence and the education needed to have a productive career in my homeland.   I am a dedicated, self-disciplined, and sociable student. I have a longstanding commitment to volunteer work, and therefore I have earned many letters of thanks from various organizations such as the Jordanian Environment Committee and Zaha Center for Children. I participated in the Language Club, Conversation Club, the Language Partner Program and I did lots of reports for my university's newspaper. And I even earned a national gold medal in stage acting.   The global economic crisis has affected Jordan in many ways and the unemployment rates have increased drastically. Unfortunately; I haven’t found a job yet and I don’t think I will be able to cover my study expenses at Lancaster without a full tuition scholarship.    Please send me an application and any other information pertaining to the Geoffery Leech Scholarships, or any other financial assistance opportunities available for postgraduate students. Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to receiving the requested paperwork.   Sincerely,

And at that moment should have been the time to bring out a line encouraging him to come to youth.. but i wasn't sure what to say without him being chased off with christianese.. so i just said "I dunno, we just have fun" and he replied by asking me to go to a party which i declined politely.. he then said "fine then, go and pray" in a harsh manner..  Can i have some suggestions on what you would have said? why? and just some overall feedback.  Thank you (:

20090220163907AAzjPJ0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the Bible book hated, or is the evangelical representation of the Bible the real problem?	The highlight of the Sermon on the Mount is "Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you." I think it would be rather rare to find a person who hates or dislikes or even has a negative comment for the Golden Rule. And that was Christ speaking... about as Christian as you can get (I mean real Christianity... click on my avatar for an explanation of that term "real Christianity")      On the other hand, Paul/Saul said "Christ died for our sins," and even though Christ himself never met Paul in the flesh, those words have come to represent Christianity!      So is the book the problem, or is it the evangelical representation of it that ruffles feathers?

As I walk down the river further I see people fishing with their children...as I walk up to them I ask if they have caught any fish...the man say's no we have not yea...I then say: that's a good thing my friend for there is fishing laws and I find you have no license and if you did caught fish... the mercury levels alone would send each to the  emergency room for a stomach pumping........

20090203055257AAmvgqK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If we are gods image, why do we have the following?	VOMERONASAL ORGAN    EXTRINSIC EAR MUSCLES  This trio of muscles most likely made it possible for prehominids to move their ears independently of their heads, as rabbits and dogs do. We still have them, which is why most people can learn to wiggle their ears    WISDOM TEETH (we would have needed these to chew tough meats and so-forth, but if you don't believe we we're once more like apes than men we don't need them)    NECK RIB  A set of cervical ribspossibly leftovers from the age of reptilesstill appear in less than 1 percent of the population. They often cause nerve and artery problems.    THIRD EYELID  A common ancestor of birds and mammals may have had a membrane for protecting the eye and sweeping out debris. Humans retain only a tiny fold in the inner corner of the eye.    DARWINS POINT  A small folded point of skin toward the top of each ear is occasionally found in modern humans. It may be a remnant of a larger shape that helped focus distant sounds.    SUBCLAVIUS MUSCLE  This small muscle stretching under the shoulder from the first rib to the collarbone would be useful if humans still walked on all fours. Some people have one, some have none, and a few have two.    PALMARIS MUSCLE  This long, narrow muscle runs from the elbow to the wrist and is missing in 11 percent of modern humans. It may once have been important for hanging and climbing. Surgeons harvest it for reconstructive surgery    ERECTOR PILI  Bundles of smooth muscle fibers allow animals to puff up their fur for insulation or to intimidate others. Humans retain this ability (goose bumps are the indicator) but have obviously lost most of the fur    PLANTARIS MUSCLE  Often mistaken for a nerve by freshman medical students, the muscle was useful to other primates for grasping with their feet. It has disappeared altogether in 9 percent of the population.    MALE UTERUS  A remnant of an undeveloped female reproductive organ hangs off the male prostate gland    FIFTH TOE  Lesser apes use all their toes for grasping or clinging to branches. Humans need mainly the big toe for balance while walking upright.    PYRAMIDALIS MUSCLE  More than 20 percent of us lack this tiny, triangular pouchlike muscle that attaches to the pubic bone. It may be a relic from pouched marsupials.    COCCYX  These fused vertebrae are all thats left of the tail that most mammals still use for balance and communication. Our hominid ancestors lost the need for a tail before they began walking upright    SINUSES   The nasal sinuses of our early ancestors may have been lined with odor receptors that gave a heightened sense of smell, which aided survival. No one knows why we retain these perhaps troublesome mucus-lined cavities, except to make the head lighter and to warm and moisten the air we breathe.      Most of these would be useful millions of years ago, but if the earth is only 10,000 years or so old, they serve no real purpose.

20090220155806AAWkRnY	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Thong Underwear Questions?	BACKGROUND:   I absolutely love when girls wear thong underwear. I always tell girls how good they look in thongs and how they should wear them all the time. The other day I was ripping on one of my friends and giving her a lot of grief for wearing granny panties and it blew up in my face. She and her friend bought me 2 four-packs of mens Joe Boxer thongs and said, "since you like thongs so much you should wear them." They want me to wear them all day for a week straight so I can tell them "first hand how great they are."       QUESTIONS:   Needless to say, I'm on day four of the challenge and have some embarrassing questions:   1) Why do girls want to grab my butt all the time after hearing I'm wearing a thong? (not complaining)   2) Why do girls feel compelled to give me a wedgie after hearing I'm wearing a thong? (complaining)   3) SInce doing this lots of girls have been flirting with me and showing me their thongs, do they actually find this hot?   4) I squirmed around the whole first day trying to get rid of the permanent wedgie feeling. By the second day though I got used to them and it has since been rather confortable. The girl who bought them said I was "just a natural thonger" because I got used to them so quickly. This freaked me out. How long should it have taken to get used to them?   5) I actually think they're comfy and I love all the female interest (guys don't even say anything because of all the attention). I definately will go back to boxers as my primary underwear since thongs kinda make me feel like less of a man, but I was wondering if it would be acceptable to wear one every now and then after the challenge is over or would that be too gay?      Sorry its so long.

20090220051533AADhZyj	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Marrying divorced women...?	In islam, we know that there is no stigma (mark that is characteristic of a defect, a mark of disgrace or infamy; a stain or reproach, as on one's reputation.) or shame in marrying a divorced woman, regardless of her age. And sufficient for the proof is the marriages of our beloved Prophet (saws) and from the shariah      However, it seems to me that there is some cultural baggage that stigmatises getting married to divorced women perhaps even more so than previously married but widowed women... regardless of their age...      So my question is, in your culture, or in cultures which you have knowledge of, what are the reasons for such stigma/shame associated with marrying divorced or previously married but widowed women...      jazaak allahu khayran wassalaamu alaykum

I have had answers to some of my questions saying 'why do monkeys and apes still exist then?' and that this is over looked by scientists etc 'because it disproves evolution'.      You lot need to read up a little more, there is an explanation for this and it isn't difficult lol      Monkeys and apes DID NOT evolve INTO humans, the evolved ALONG SIDE us. The easiest way to describe this is that we have a common ancestor(the base of the tree)and as time went by, due to different factors, branches appeared(different species). Get it? They will continue along side us but at one point in time may be completely different to us. Like we are different to cats but are still related.

20090203054327AAHEguK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this the ultimate proof that God exists?	OK.. i just had a bright idea (tell me what you think).      It is accepted that the israelites passed through the red sea. Historians and geographical experts could tell us ROUGHLY where they passed (let's say within 50 mile radius).       Now, it is well known that not only did the Israelites cross the red sea, but the Egyptian Army died whilst crossing it. Their charriots and their horseriders all drowned when the sea fell upon them.      So - what is the proof?      Well, if this story did happen, surely their relics (their charriots, their helmets, their armor etc) should still be embedded in the sea. All it needs is submarine archaelolgists to go there are start digging around.    Whatever they find will prove that this happened.

I got all these "Je t'aime" crap. SERIOUSLY, HOW DO YOU SAY "I love" not "I LOVE YOU". Get it? I want to know if "J'adore" is the correct translation. If I'm wrong tell me.

20090220161122AAaZFvq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why I abhor religious zealots.  Open to all religions and denominations?	First off, I am a decorated US military veteran, giving over 20 years of my life to serving.  Second, it is stated in my profile that I am neither Atheist nor Christian.  Third, I have always made it plain that there is a difference between faith and religion, and it is the religion that I detest not the faith.  Last, at no time do I ever swear or threaten in my arguments, that is just ignorance coming out.      All of that being said...   Last night, out of the blue, I received an IM from a woman in Rogers, Arkansas.  This woman was looking for a fight, and try as I might, she got her wish.  This woman was a so-called Christian - 46 years old - and the first thing I get is that I am to leave the country because I don't agree with her views on Jesus.  I was also called a traitor.  I was literally chewed out because I disagree with Christians.  She was very insistent on getting my religion, I gave her three to choose from, none of them true.  She also used the most profane language and condescending terms for blacks, gays, Muslims and Islams.  Oh, and she didn't really seem to know the difference between Muslim and Islam.  She said that she was a DEVOUT Christian and there was no doubt in her mind that she was going to heaven and I am going to hell.  And the fact that I use that Gandhi quote sent her off to no end.  The words that this woman typed were atrocious, profane, ignorant and proved the quote 100 times over.      Now for my question:  At what point is being a devout anything going too far?  I tried expressing my opinions, but she has such a closed mind that nothing got through.  When is it too much?      As always, be courteous when answering my questions as I am in answering yours, whether I agree with your views or not.      Doc

20090203054429AAfXUAO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why couldn't it be like this?	Rather than heaven and hell being 'objective', that is, places outside of you where you go after you die depending on how you behave, but conditions that are current and right now. Your inner experience which is created by you and can be changed. If you are kind and loving and humble then you have a heavenly experience. If you are arrogant and easily angered and vain and negative, then you have a hellish experience. So maybe, heaven and hell are right here, right now, inside of you. Didn't Jesus say "the kingdom of heaven is at hand"?. Maybe that means right now and right here, not some other place at some other time.

Well we were really close and then something happened which made him think I am gay. Which it had nothing to do with that. He pretty much thinks i was like trying to make an advance on him. And I would never do that because he is my friend and I respect the friendship to ever try to ruin it like that. We were really close (like if you didn't know us you might think we were gay). Like we could fall asleep in the same bed and give each other massages. Stuff that's pretty rare to find in guy friends. So he stopped talking with me after the misunderstanding and I've done everything I feel to mend the friendship. But he's really stubborn and so convinced I did it because i like like him.       To make clear I'm bi he's not. He doesn't know and I am but I never did any of that stuff for him because I liked him. I didn't realize I did then. I don't want to tell him. I don't feel the need to because my orientation has nothing to do with what happened. So any ideas of what I should do? Like why would he throw away the friendship over something so retarded?      It's been months since that's happened and I'm still bugging about it. And now I wonder if I do like him because I still want to fix this and I am hurting because I lost my friend.

20090220161440AAmja0w	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do you deal with troublesome neighbors?	I have been exposed to some very bizarre behavior from the strange man who lives next door to me. He dresses like a wizard and carries out odd ceremonies that I can hear through the kitchen wall. The whole thing is completely harmless but I admit to feeling a bit disturbed by it. My friends have been winding me up saying that he probably sacrifices virgins while wearing his mothers underwear amongst other strange imagined scenarios that he might be getting up to behind closed doors. Although I think the sacrifice part may be correct. My cat has gone missing and my severed pet rabbits head was stuffed through my letterbox. I was suspicious that it might be a friend winding me up, so I shot his dog. I think I may have made a mistake because other people in the neighbor hood have had their pets disappear lately also. I am now sure it is the wizard and to make things worse I seen him appearing to levitate in his back garden last night. Am I losing my mind or could he have real witchcraft like powers? I want him arrested either way and I am going to the police. Any advice?

20090220093500AAjPNp7	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Interracial SEX and, roll playing.........when is it too weird??? Any Advise or opinions?	Ok I'm only 20 and, I've just recently come out of that "infamous closet"      I'm fairly new to sex...gay sex (sex of ANY kind really) and, I'm overly submissive...I pretty much will do anything to please others and, I'm pretty shy and timid as a person. Plus I'm a small guy.      So,...anyways....There's this black guy named Jason that has made me his "booty call" recently. And, he actually admits being somewhat racist but, that he likes to " f " white boys....BELIEVE ME.... HE DOES!!!!! HE REALLY REALLY DOES!!!!!      Which works as I have a serious case of jungle fever myself...       He's a REALLY big guy!!! Tall, strong, and aggressive!!! He's actually "BI" and, unless you knew....You would NEVER know he likes to have sex with guys...specifically white guys. He seems 100% straight!!!!      He's actually way more into girls than guys.....and, yep you guessed it white girls......except in my case........he's got a serious SERIOUS something for me!!!!! He's obsessed I think.      He's always telling me how naturally feminine I am and, how am a such pretty boy. Which is like a backhanded compliment.        He also makes it known that were NOT in any kind of relationship.....of ANY kind.....he's JUST here to " f " me!  But,....if that's true how come he NEVER leaves me alone...and, GETS REALLY mad if I don't want to get "f'"-ed  ( because I'm recovering)       AND, he's actually very jelous because if I don't want to get "f"-ed he accuses me of letting someone else "hit that" and, I better NOT let someone else hit it because my white  A.S.$  belongs to him. Which is also REALLY weird because I'm pretty sure he wants to run a train on me!!!         He makes it a point to say he ONLY gives it....NEVER EVER receives...      Which is cool Because I would never feel comfortable giving anyways ( I'm small down there).      He also goes OUT of his way to make it clear that he ONLY recieves head  and, WILL NEVER EVER.......under ANY conditions give it!!!!!!      Which also is alright.....because of my submissive nature and,....I enjoy being on my knee's anyways. AND, I like giving head.        He seems TOTALLY straight and, he's actually very Kinda hood-ish. He is also an entire foot taller than me and, probably outweighs me by at least 85 pounds. He's also almost ten years older than me 2. And, is very experienced!!! And bossy!!!!!!!       I'm actually pretty afraid of him...So I pretty much say and DO ANYTHING and EVERYTHING he says...but, It IS a little weird.....First thing is...he likes to refer to himself as "The Black-Quarter back" and to me as "The White Receiver"       He even saved me in his phone that way!!!!       He is clearly obsessed with having sex with me! He REALLY loves very white skin and, big butts! And I am REALLY bright white and, even though I'm petite my butt is HUGE!!!......like a big ol' ghetto booty you'd see in a music video.        So, he wants to " f " me like ALL the time!!! Sometimes he makes me stay at his place for constant access and, won't really let me leave.    Which is weird because he's ADAMANT about NO ONE knowing he's    Gay....he doesn't even consider himself that....he says he's NOT gay........He just likes to " F " white boys ( which belive me IS TRUE ) .......whatever that means!!! What does that mean???? Any thoughts????      He's always saying he's the only real N-(word)  that's REALLY out there sticking to the man!       And, he says other random racist stuff like "black f's white....white ain't never supposed to f black"  Or, that Its my place to do what I do for and, with him because of 40 acres that he never got.....that he's taking out of my ( A  $  $ )      Anyways.......he's the second guy that's been inside me and,...we've been F****ing on and off....but, mostly ON for nearly 3 weeks now.      But, what he REALLY REALLY likes to do with me is that...he likes roll playing.....I like it too but, its kinda weird!!! So, I wanted to get some outside input!      He likes to pretend that I'm a sissy slave master's son and, he's an escaped slave that....makes me HIS slave      He gets REALLY into it and, at times he's really rough!!! And is really vocal with racial slurs!!! He spanks my bottom open handed really hard....pulls my hair and...All sorts of stuff      During this....he wants me to call him Master and, be especially submissive and obediant.....      He also makes me baby oil myself up (.....sometimes he helps) before sex. He likes it better like that but, then he makes me clean his sheets and, his apartment by myself........After the mess....... He says I MADE.......when HE'S the one making ME do the baby oil thing!!!       Plus he's REALLY well endowed!!! And, its hard for me to take all the punishment! He gets mad about that too and, says its my job....as a lil' white sissy boy....so man up for once in my life...... SOmetimes DURING the actual act he'll say stuff like "good job!!!! Now who's a big boy"......SOmetimes he's nicer and, will just tell me I need to be broken in......but, he been breaking me in

God can give the whole time from Satan/serpent Eze.28:13-15, Gen.5:1-3, Eve and Adam sin, and now all born are born dying to   Matt.1:1-17, Jesus in N. T. and at 2009 CE is 2615 years ago at   year 3460, Judah kings ended [ 606 BCE ], Matt.2:2, Jesus to be    king at his 2nd coming & end of world from Eden, still GOD ALONE   KNOWS DAY AND HOUR, at Jesus 1000 year reign, Eph.2:7,3:21, the world with Jesus is without end, John 3:16, 17:3.      Lets face it, reality is for any one to know, we are not going to get   from Eden to Matt.1:1-17, without thousands of years passing to   do so [ it is not age of the ages old earth ], we are not going to be   at 2009 CE, unless Jesus has already had his first coming in N.T.   and the world knows he will have his 2nd coming and the word says   reign 1000 years.

20090220141811AAkBK5C	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	LGBT:What should I wear to a nanny job interview?	I have a job interview coming up this weekend for a family I may work for for the next year and a half. It is a live-out nanny position watching a two-month old and a four-year old.      I would like to know what I should wear to the interview. I know I need to look nice, but since it is for a family and not a company, I'm not sure how much I should dress-up. Should I go with really nice or a casual-nice look? I am not sure if I should really dress up for the interview or if I should wear something comfortable that I would be willing to watch the kids while wearing.      Thank you!

And why is a "Black Nurses Association" (  http://www.nbna.org/  ) not racist, when there would be an outcry if we had a "White Nurses Association"?

Does the room service cost extra money?   ? Are there good shops in the local area?   ? What types of things do they sell?

20090220150447AAiN1mi	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you think human beings were meant to be "married"?	Someone else just asked about how it feels to be married, trapped or great and it got me thinking about how we would behave naturally without knowing what we're "supposed to do".      Let's admit that we are just another animal.  The most evolved species in an ever evolving world, but still an animal.  I always knew I wanted to get married, but I suppose I've been cultured to think thats the only way and the proper way good people live.        Yet go back 1,000 years, or 10,000.  Humans lived in tribes to survive no doubt, and had children together.  But what about the concept of one partner till you die?  I believe it myself, but I'm not certain its correct.  The idea sure feels comfortable cause its what I'm used to, but I'd like to hear some other peoples feelings on a question thats probably not thought about too often.        It's taken for granted that everyone is better off that way, but is that true?  Didn't some societies raise kids as a group rather than one family?  And in the pure animal kingdom, are there any other species where the male stays with the female to raise the offspring?        I believe that God created (or whoever/ whatever you believe) this universe to function so that not everyone is equal...men have certain qualities, women do to (men can't breastfeed for ex, and before the modern technology of formula - a mothers milk and ability to get a feeble precious baby to eat enough meant LIFE OR DEATH for the baby).      What do you think?

20090220151251AAQZWTC	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Long story but PLEASE read and HELP!!?	I became friends with a girl when i was 15 and she was 16 and we started to hang out a lot. I told her I was bi one night and she was shocked but was ok with it. Then one night we had been drinking a lot and she kissed me. At first I was like wtf!! But then one thing led to another and we..you know! This then went on for quite a while but it was always when we had had a drink. Then when we were sober we wouldn't ever talk about it. Sometimes, it seemed we would only be getting alcohol so as we could be together, because to be drunk somehow made it ok.      But, after a while she started to see a boy. She still didnt stop things with me but she didnt stop things with him either. Sometimes I thought she was trying to make me jealous. But after a while me and her stopped being intimate, I dont really know why. And she started seeing him more and more. I was heartbroken. But we stayed friends. I was convinced I was in love with her and I couldn't believe what she was doing to me. So I cut her out of my life, I stopped going out with her, I made new friends and tried to forget her but I couldn't. I thought about her every day and it was so frustrating. I really wanted to tell her how I felt but I was to scared of what she'd say.      After 5 months, she got in contact again and wanted to see me. And me being an idiot agreed. We went out a few times and it seemed like she was trying to rekindle what we had had but I wasn't completely sure. She was still seeing this boy aswell although she would constantly say she was only with him for his money and she didnt like him.       Eventually she broke it off with him and me and her became best friends again. We spent every minute of every day together and although nothing happened it felt as though the connection was still there. She would always touch me in innapropriate places and then say she was messing. I was more confused than ever. She would tell me that whenever she left my house she would feel sick at the thought of leaving me. Whatever that means.      BUT...once again we drifted apart because i got a job and that meant we had less time to spend together. I asked her out a few times but she always had plans so eventually I stopped asking.      Now, she is seeing another boy who she used to say she liked a lot. But she keeps texting me asking me to go out with her and I'm trying to ignore them.      She is the first person I have ever felt like this about and I'm now 17 and she's 18 and it's gone on to long.      Please someone help !!

(if you are a person as such) to pass the buck, manipulate, do cursed rituals ect in a path the church dictates to you down the street in exchange of revenge ect so a deal for the church to give you some needed pride and a few laughs. well your the type of ignorance within humanity that should get in a space ship and live on another planet.      im also a christian witch forgiving my trepassers dictated to me at a church. i have also learned ignorance is bliss. as far as can be thrown. there exists within humans a weak mind that chooses an ignorant life. so i have to forgive you and hope your ignorant life is bliss.      id like to take a poll on your life so far and if you believe in change.      1) have you lived an weak minded ignorant life as detailed in my essay   2) are you attending a church that dictates   3) you take the fifth and all of the above   4) you yourself believe in human progress   5) you believe in testing everything and believe nothing   6) you have read the satanic bible and practice (utterly destroy the weak mind)   7) I choose to follow a weak mind ignorant life because in witchcraft to get more results one has to be willing to pay for it. and pay dues   8) ive paid my fare share of dues   9) i believe one billion religious people alone in a room with god have had their dues paid for. when masterbating in front of god there is no imbarassment because it normal way to realease the tension of the denial of love evolution tries to balance out in life.   10) i am one of one billion athiests that have vatican approval (we believe one day there wont be fear a human walks down a given street any time of day) so religion has required all our dues to be paid by others   11) i dont want population control to effect my family or friends so seek to buy some time more in societies progress of space travel.   12) im a member of fsm and look forward to the satanic proof in 2012. in intelagent design has only been found in religion and evoluton to read intelagent design by a satanist as in this essay report we at fsm take our hats off and bow in the presence and pleasure to the satanic realm, to continue in intelagent design to be continued and practiced within satanizm. pride within fsm hope one day to succed in developing by our selves what i read here.      we at fsm control our god to except us as slaves even though our dictators keep secret we are, this is known as the butterfly effect and obtain such intelagent design in hope one day to be the only humans with power wealth and greed.      our dictorain dictates any and all id to be forwareded to a fsm member in doing so may the appendage of his noodless bless you.      13) im a cos associate want to take someone for their word in lifes evolutions debate what do we as h

20090220155337AAz0ppG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can everyone understand the Words of God?	I read from someone on Y!A about trying to understand the bible. They argued that there was so many contradictions and listed them so when I went down his list of contradictions I found that he purposely listed contradictions but obviously knew nothing about the Word of God to any degree. There was a few that caught my eyes right off because I have read and do read the bible and if you have the Holy Spirit as your teacher then you can understand the scriptures. Here is one of them he listed "Contradiction #34 Was John the Baptist Elijah who was to come? (a) Yes (Matthew 11:14, 17:10-13). (b) No (John 1:19-21)." ok but if one really studied the bible in order to learn more about God rather than use it to go against God they might find (Luke 1:17). "And he(John the Baptist) shall go before Him(Jesus Christ) in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord." Trying to use the bible against itself is very pointless to convince Christians to turn their backs on God because if they are truly a Christian then The Holy Spirit keeps them. Thank you and may all come to the realization that Jesus Christ is Lord forever.

20090203063211AAtxvrJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Have you ever met someone you believe to be holy ?story?	Just the other day I found out one of my closest friends are dieing. I was really depressed, so I went for a walk. I ended up walking over 3 miles without even realizing it! When I finally woke up out of the state of being dazed. I saw this elderly Black man with a concern look. As I approached him I've notice his light light blue eyes almost white; which they seem to look through me, and into my pain .Just standing next to him I felt a greater force then I've ever known. I asked him if he was o-kay, I have a soft heart for the elderly. He grinned at me and said "I'm here to ask you that same question." I couldn't help myself, A tear released itself from my broken heart. He hugged me , and told me "everything is going to be alright", and "he'll (my friend) end up in Gods kingdom, not to worry." I was sooo touched by this elderly man. My friend  my is dieing of HIV. He was infected by helping out a dieing women. He saved her life, and she infected his. If there was ever a time in my life where I believed in the unknown of the holiness of life, it would be now. He wasn't just a person standing there, he knew he had to be there. Call me crazy but I just can't stop thinking about this old man. I don't think I'll ever forget his face in a million years.          Do you have a story that is something like what I've experience ?

20090203063508AA0ROrB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Pagans: March 20..Spring ritual question...?	In our tradition, we hold a Spring ritual especially designed for children. The Egyptian belief was that Osiris would spring out of the ground in his form of Unnut (a rabbit god). This is why the earth begins to regain its greenery (Osiris is an underworld god (rots) who is depicted as green, representing foliage). The egg is representative of Isis fertility (and represents Goddess in the hieroglyph). We always try to do something to represent those two aspects of the season.. What I am looking for are children's games that would (or could) represent both or either aspect (rabbit/egg). Does anyone have any suggestions?       Yes, I plan far ahead of time...

I use to when I was a kid, but now that I've grown up and taken a real good look at the world, and I mean a REAL GOOD LOOK. At the world. People are suffering and dieing in the name of God, or religion. I watched a video of a young girl being beaten to death by her own family, because she supposidly spoke to someone of another religion. It was awfull. If there really is a "God" I serously doubt that he/she would be impressed in the way we've as a human race destroyed one another, and our beloved planet. But so many people believe so strongly in their religion, or "God" That they would kill and die for it. Why?

20090203060145AAKDS9c	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What if God had wanted the people to save Jesus?	I'm going to say that I believe in Christianity again, and ask you all to Imagine this:      God put Jesus to be crucified, as a test to see if the people would rally and save Jesus, by saving the son of God, they have committed the ultimate repentance, and would be forgiven.      But the people, thinking that it was God's will to put Jesus in the Crucifix, did not do anything but stare. And so Jesus dies a horrible death, and resurrects pissed off but willing to forgive.      -      Think about it, an all-powerful, all-loving, fair and just God would have thought of a better plan of forgiving our sins than sacrificing your Beloved Son of God.Killing your son to forgive others? it doesn't make sense.      But testing others to save your son that is in agony, and if they did, forgive them for their past sins would be a perfect way to forgive the sinners.      Yet believers opt for sacrificing the son to forgive others technique as the better one, Why so?
20090203063623AA4BcJ1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians; what is evolution to you?	(question from an atheist)
20090203063010AAK1hSo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do we need to have or feel...........?	that there is a higher power than what is for us as humans?    I was just contemplating how there are so many different cultures and beliefs all around the world separated by oceans, mountains, and heavy dense terrain, but yet every culture all over the world believed in some form of deity or higher power controlling their lives or the hereafter. I base it on this, look at North, Central, and South America. They never knew that Europe or even China existed for over 5000 yrs, but yet had a complex belief and religion. Australia has been separated from major continents for over 10,000 yrs but the Aborigines had their own idea of the spiritual. Why did they?    The Christians all over the world remember that their belief is the true belief but it came from the middle east. It has been proven that there were several different other beliefs of that time that had been around much longer. The "barbarians" of Western Europe even had a concept of deity as early as the cave dwelling days of man. Why?   What causes us to believe in a spiritual plane of existence? What makes us feel that it is true? As modern as we are and now understand the reason for the weather, the movements of the sun moon and stars, the reason for earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, the changing of the seasons, the reason we think, use mathmatics, written language, music, all these things that early man thought were done by some unseen force or given as gifts by these deities or spirits, as well as the belief in another plain of existence when we die, the idea of a soul or spirit released at the time of death and moving on. Why do we still feel that it is real or that They exist and we are just small pieces of the divine?    I know many atheists will poke fun at this and that is fine, but seriously, has anyone ever thought about it? Even the most devout Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, even Pagan has asked this question at one point in their lives and just wanted to see what other people think from their spiritual standpoint.    Thanks for opening up   Blessings to you all
20090203063746AA5jvc1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: Have you transitioned from listening to others to listening to God?	I always use to seek the answers of my problems(which are many) from my friends and family but now I feel like I already have the answers. I met with my brother's pastor and his wife last week and they gave me a lot of advice but it felt wrong and I left feeling worst then when going there. Anyone else experience a shift from listening to others and listening to God's voice inside you? Should I trust that gut feeling on things that I feel strongly?      Wanted to say its not just me listening to the things that sound good to me. For instance sometimes someone suggests something that I want but for some reason know its not right for me.

20090203061734AASiKqH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	WHy did Jesus have to die for your sins?	According to your holy book, the sins of the father do not go to the son / daughter. So therefore there is no reason for us to suffer from the original sin, nor need to be forgiven> Surely if God follows his own words, we should of been allowed back in the garden of eden as soon as Adam and Eve kicked the bucket. Is he just lying to us?      (Ezekiel 18:20) - "The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father’s iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son’s iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself."

What if you gave your life to someone that you love very deeply, only to find out that the person is in hell or going to hell? Could you really enjoy heaven knowing that the person that you love is burning in hell? It could be a brother,sister, mom, dad, wife, girlfriend, best friend, or anyone that you care about. Would you not plea to God to save them? How can you assume that God would answer your plea when god ignores so many people in their last words to be saved? Is that the type of heavenly life you want? How can you justify gods actions against you and the people that you love based on a belief and not how you live? Is this the god you want to worship? If so, I truly feel deeply sorry for you.  Personally, I choose hell.  It would feel like hell knowing that everything I ever cared is in hell burning for all eternity.

I know the United States and many other countries are going through some rather tough times, and at the same time wouldn't you agree that our country was founded on optimism and not on pessimism.     I truly would like to know where are all of the optimists?      I have witnessed an increase in pessimism and would like to know what we can do to bring back more optimism.    I understand and totally agree that there are optimist and pessimist and that everyone has the right to be what they want to be, and at the same time wouldn't you agree that more optimism rather than pessimism especially at this time when our country and the countries of the world are going through these hard times would be more beneficial to the world.    A short while back I offered through Yahoo Answers a totally free interactive desktop that could be used to:  * bring joy into their lives, their families lives and their friends lives  * change their lives, their families lives and their friends lives for the better  * help those who own their own business to better market their products, services, skills etc.  * help those who own their own business to improve customer relations, get new customers and keep those they have.    Maybe I failed to present my offer in such a way that would lead to an optimistic view rather than a pessimistic view regarding the offer.    I once again offer those who are optimistic and those who are pessimistic to accept this totally free interactive desktop for their own benefit, their familes benefit and their friends benefit.    For this totally free interactive desktop with all of its benefits go to web2wow.com/helpfulhank    Please answer my question and provide some advice as to how we can increase optimism in these tough times.
