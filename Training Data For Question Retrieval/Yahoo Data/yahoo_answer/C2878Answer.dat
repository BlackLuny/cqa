GlccYmx4aa	$2 tip is appropriate.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Just give the guy a buck and leave it at that. A dollar won't kill ya|`|MJvL013yaa	Why does it matter that YOU are broke? Ever occur to you HE might be broke, too? He's bringing you food so you don't have to wake your baby. Selfish girl, maybe you should PLAN better next time.   I cannot believe you would consider giving him NOTHING.|`|UCpdxLPhaa	Tip the poor delivery person a buck and let the baby sleep.|`|r2FPPsqIaa	no tip if your broke too.|`|6ubffIyWaa	Depends if you have enough money or not, if your broke (like me) i always think of it in this way, i can just manage to pay for myself to live let alone pay for someone else to as well, although if he comes earlier i would tip him if he comes on time or late i really wouldn't bother haha!   Maybe am just tight haha! But i defiantly wouldn't give him over $5, like come on 10 minutes down the road understandable if it was further but 10 minutes is nothing haha!|`|YfdcurMwaa	Just give him one or two dollars. They usually add in delivery fee, but still, tips are tokens of appreciation, I guess.    My family always give tips when we order delivery. It's a good thing to do.

McDonalds is OK, for teenagers and struggling college students.|`|wvdTr3mRaa	Does that really matter to you? He's your boyfriend. If you love him for him then that shouldn't matter at all. My first date with my boyfriend, believe it or not was at a library...we went to mcdonalds first then we spent the rest of the day at the library. And honestly, I absolutely loved every minute of it. I got to spend time with him and that's what matters to me the most. Now six months later, and we're still together.|`|ebKlXUEtaa	Depends on his financial situation and how old you are.  If you have a good time and enjoy being together you have a future.  That's the test really, if it's a good thing you'll just be happy to spend time together.  If you had a good time on your first date at Micky D's Id say you're doing ok.|`|RQh3SG2Oaa	If you like him give him a chance, he may really have wanted to spend time with you and didn't have allot of money to drop on an expensive place.   My first date with my husband of ten years was at Micky D's. It was well worth suffering through a greasy hamburger and cold fries for all the wonderful times we had together and the 3 terrific kids we now have.|`|tv7anaBDaa	Well depends does he come from a family that can afford more than Micky D's. if not than thats not that good. but i think if he's a good guy and you realy like him than that should not make a decishion of him not being the one|`|672d45cf5053056aa311fd923b5d915faa	wow.well there's nothing wrong with mcdonalds, they have good food. maybe he's trying 2 save money for you all next date. as long as you ate good & you all enjoyed yall selves, it shouldn't matter if he took you 2 mcdonalds on the first date. just let it not be a habit 2 him.

JfVxCDb7aa	The meat is cooked on grease. The fries are cooked in grease. And the items are high in calories from fat.|`|zNjACkxpaa	there are no more calories in McDonald's food than food purchased anywhere else of the same serving size and ingredients. It is just that the food is not what would be considered a "good health choice".    If you had a regular hamburger, salad with fat free dressing, diet soda or milk and fruit it would be quite healthy    If you get a big mac or quarter pounder with cheese, large fries, milk shake or sugar soda and a pie you have pretty well eaten at least 1/2 of the recommended calories in one meal. And probably more fat and salt than you should eat in a day.    Check out this website   http://www.menshealth.com/eatthis/fast-f...   for healthy food suggestions at McDonalds|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	It depends on what you eat.  I saw a TV documentary about a nutrionist who did the opposite of the guy in "Supersize Me" by eating all the healthy foods at McDonald's and she actually lost weight.  She ate every meal there, just like he did, but she chose the healthy foods ... salads, wraps, grilled chicken, yogurt, etc.  She was actually healthier at the end of the experiment than she was when she began.|`|TEMriZfkaa	because to cook it they drowned it in grease|`|jXAbTovcaa	Seriously aint much food out there without calories tasting goood|`|sqPoFZ00aa	Because it's fast food.

I eat there 5 nights a week (I work there), so I know what a huge challenge it is to eat healthy there.  The unhealthy things just taste sooo good.<br>  <br>  Anything you order can be made without butter.  Thats key.  Something that seems healthy may not be, because they scoop melted butter on the grill to cook it.  Same goes for the steamed veggies.  There's a ton of butter.  Also the butter used for everything is "whipped butter", meaning it is mixed with whipping cream. Just order without it.  <br>  Stay away from sauces when you can.  All dressings and sauces are made daily in house and most are crazy fattening. <br>  As for salads, the only fat free dressing is tangy tomato (similar to a french) but to be quite honest, there's a ton of sugar.  Mustard vinegarette is less fattening than the creamy dressings (I'd stay away from those altogether).  I would go with mustard vingarette on the side or oil and vinegar.<br>  <br>  Specific menu suggestions:<br>  Chicken on the barbie (no butter)...8 oz grilled chicken breast with bbq on the side<br>  <br>  Salmon (no butter)<br>  <br>  A lean steak every once and a while isn't bad for you.  The filet is delicious and super lean.  There is also a new slow roasted filet tenderloin that is fantastic.<br>  <br>  pork tenderloin...if you get this one (it is awesome), ask for the apricot glaze on the side.  This is a new item and I'm honestly not quite sure what is in the glaze, but it is far too yummy to not have it.  I'd just use it sparingly.<br>  <br>  The grillers mentioned by others are good, but they have a sweet glaze on the meat and veggies.  I want to tell you to get it without the glaze, but man, it is good.  I don't know exactly how bad it is, but its sweet, so there's the sugar factor and I believe it is butter based.<br>  <br>  There's also a chicken sandwhich, which is a good option.<br>  <br>  Side items:  veggies (no butter), baked potato (toppings on the side), sweet potato (ask specifically for regular butter only and on the side), green beans (no butter)<br>  <br>  Sides to stay away from: garlic mashed potatoes, fries, sweet potato with all the toppings (honey butter, brown sugar, cinamon).  The rice I have mixed feelings about.  It is healthy, long grain rice, but it is also cooked with a ton of butter, so I'm torn.<br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy it.  Don't feel horrible if you cheat though.  There are some amazing things there, even if they aren't the healthiest options.  Six years and I still love the food.|`|CLm2dX1faa	Wow did you know that the Aussie fries are one of the top do not eat on eat this not that. They say you can have 13 crispe  creme doughnuts  compared to those fries.  <br>  I would go with a 6 or 8 oz filet or sirloin , steamed veg and baked potato. If you do get a salad use oil and vinegarar on the side.|`|43616b1142ed222b0bb58f0c53418494aa	you could order a plain baked potato with stuff on the side. potatoes are pretty low in calories. just stay away from any of their dangerous appetizers. order a plain house salad with dressing on the side when everyone else is eating those disgusting cheese fries.

YUshhmmRaa	Some fine dining restaurants look for support staff during their busy times and as a back up in case some of their serving staff is out. You may not get the front dining room right away but you can start in the back or at a lower level and then move up.<br>  <br>  You can always call the restaurant and ask to talk to the manager or HR. Make an appointment if you can and go see them. Honesty is always important but they also look for enthusiasm, responsibility, well manners and clean-cut looks.<br>  <br>  There are also specialized head-hunters where you can go for an interview and they may be able to guide you to get a job at a fine restaurant.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jdeanejobs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jdeanejobs.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://newyorkcity.employmentguide.com/Restaurant_jobs/apply.html" rel="nofollow">http://newyorkcity.employmentguide.com/R...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tablesetter.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tablesetter.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hospitalityhr.com/New-York/33-0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hospitalityhr.com/New-York/33...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hcareers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hcareers.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZzJmUerpaa	best thing to do is on your days off go in and ask to see the owner or manaager.--be well dressed and groomed and tell them you want to work there.--tell them you have experince in serving albeit not as nice as this.--be honest.i bet u within 5 tries you will get a tryout.----now with fine dining have your head on a swivel.never walk anywhere without looking to see if somebody at your table is making eye contact.--if somebody is at the table and then looks at you what do u think that means?--it means they are looking for something they dont raise the hand in fine dining.--that tip was free use it

Call them up, I'm sure they would be more than willing to take care of you and your guest.  It's right on the corner of Colorado Blvd and Pasadena Ave. (near frwy), plenty of parking nearby, street parking and valet.|`|tEWOUrVpaa	H(o)(o)TERS, they will make your party the BEST.
SqPVrEaCaa	not right offhand|`|bLahP9Ivaa	Ali's Kebab in Queens New York serves bulls testicles|`|m3NVpPpiaa	A mans stamina during sex depends on his control. Don't think bull penises will help with that. Check where you live if there are any East Indian restaurants near by.|`|xuaWQax0aa	ew
JfVxCDb7aa	NO    THEY  ARE KEPT    IN   SMALL  CAGES THOUGH|`|UAMtRFruaa	Yes. They only use live chickens when they put them in the roaster. While cruel, they do taste better that way.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Well - in the strictest terms, KFC does not raise chickens at all.  They buy them from suppliers.  There are no KFC Chicken farms.  I know this fact doesn't feed into the emotional-sob-fest that PETA has for KFC but it is true.    That same can be said that McDonald's and Arby's do not have cattle ranches.      PETA claims they are trying to improve conditions at the vendors that provide chickens to KFC (stop and think why an organization such as PETA who advocates you eat NO animals, would want humane conditions at a farm that grows chickens for the sole purpose of human consumption.) and they are doing this by putting pressure on a company that is well known and will keep their 'defense' of the charges in the news.      Their real goal is to turn people off of the idea of eating chicken in general, by running a smear campaign.    True - chickens are not treated like your pets at home, but they aren't pets - it is a fact of life that other animals are used as food.
0fS6Qd6Uaa	I don't eat seals  I eat fish and people don't go around beating fish with axes but this was pretty upsetting.  In the end its an animal vs animal world. Whether you like it or not its going to happen.  Maybe not with humans but with other animals..  If all your concerned about is people beating the seals with axes then don't worry about it(for to much longer) its going to stop.|`|d0BRip3gaa	OMG that was really sad. It actually made me cry : (   I can't believe someone would actually kill those seals like that.   That was HORRIBLE.
1ldXOsjkaa	I found a large list of Florida pizza restaurants. I bet someone in your hometown can help assist you. http://www.locatepizza.com/Florida-Pizza... Just phone one of the Florida pizza joints or drop by one day when you are not busy and try talking to cook who can help.|`|JSryPP8faa	Call Tim Tebow, he know's everything U of F need's to know.
PxJXJKCpaa	I've had good food there, but terrible service at times.  I ordered crab legs and couldn't get into them because of someone elses' birthday.  I just sat there looking pissed off and no one noticed I had NO SILVERWARE or crab cracking utensils.  By the time I got to eat my crab, they were cold and hard to get into.    Then, the next time, I was treated like a queen, as I complained to my server.  I got free food, free beer and anything I needed.    Food is good there.  Service lacks some at some places.|`|ZPGhnsnMaa	good they have everything not just sea food ive been there 5 times i think|`|oexJh3Rjaa	tastes like a computer.|`|vwjeG8n7aa	Good..if you like crab legs you can get them seasoned five different ways.
6NiYAS5Daa	i think its just for publicity|`|Oopl4ccWaa	I used to be a GM for Jack in the Box, their advertising company has won MANY awards.  It is another way to try and sell the brand|`|b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	That never crossed my mind.  I would like to think that if they are in financial trouble that they wouldn't spend money as frivolously as that on silly commercials.
