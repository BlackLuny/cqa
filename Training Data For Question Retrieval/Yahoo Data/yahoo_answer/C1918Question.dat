20090131173956AAJ1hAc	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	My PC is running very hot. Suggestions?	My PC is overclocked a fair amount higher than the way it started out and since it requires so much power and it's wintertime (where the heat is on all day) it has been running very hot recently. I checked with Speedfan and it said it was in the high 90's while playing Left 4 Dead maxed out. It was actually reverting the overclock multiplier back to 6x from 9x to try and cool it down (and changing the multiplier without changing the Mhz value causes a pretty dramatic loss in performance). I recently opened a window to let the frigid winter air in, which I obviously would prefer not to do, but it seems like the only option. Now it's at about a steady 72-73 while I'm just on the internet and stuff and the high 80's up to about 92 while playing intensive games. Am I going on a fast track to ruining my PC like this? Do you have any suggestions for me (preferably that don't include buying anything expensive)? I would prefer not to scale back my OC if I can help it, as I want to play Fallout 3 and Mirror's Edge at these settings (once you go max you can't go back). If someone could help me I would really appreciate it! Thanks!                  My dxdiag (sorry about the long post):   Also I have an Antec 900 case with the top front small fan seemingly broken.   ------------------   System Information   ------------------   Time of this report: 1/31/2009, 20:28:44          Machine name: ADMIN-PC      Operating System: Windows Vista?

When I press the power button on my Dell Inspiron 6400 laptop, the power light and the battery indicator light both light up, but then after a few seconds all lights go out except for the battery light. At first I thought the battery was pooched, but then I found the battery meter on the battery itself. As I leave the laptop plugged in, the meter on the battery has been going up. Am I missing something, or is the battery just dead? Is there any way to reset the laptop or anything, or any suggestions on what it could potentially be aside from a dead battery? Thanks.

I got a new laptop with a slightly better Ghz clock speed, but it is an AMD Turion X2.  My main use is music recording -- intensive multi-track programs like Cubase that max out everything.  This system can accept up to 8 GB Ram -- double my old system.  Will it be able to match the other system's performance. For a music program that simultaneously uses many synths, effects, etc. -- will the RAM be a deciding factor (more so than CPU) on how good the machine is?  Please let me know your thoughts and thanks.  Can't test it yet, and want to make sure I got a good system for my needs. Thanks again.

I want to upgrade the RAM for my computer, an eMachine T3516 as I mentioned in the question. The label on the front of my computer say that I have 512MB of DDR SDRAM.

If my setup (currently) looks like this -   AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 4800+ @ 2.5 ghz   3GB PC2 6400 DDR2 SDRAM    300+GB HD   on Vista Home Premium SP1 32bit Operating System      (and a lame NVidia FeForce 6150SE nForce 430)      The question is - I want to replace my graphics card (obviously, as it's integrated and poor at running games well) with an upgrade for a PCI slot. If I were to get the NVidia 9800 GTX + 512 MB DDR3 PCI-Express 2.0 - would I be set for graphics? Do I need something that powerful? Is it poweful enough to run games like Oblivion or The Witcher - Devil May Cry 4 - and those of the type?      Suggestions? Opinions?      Thanks in advance.

20090131175737AAOabTg	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	How can I fix errors on my laptop disk? I have a HP Windows Vista.? Upon Turning On PC a message appears with ?	the statement: One of your disc needs to be checked for consistency. Type of file system NTFS. I also have Norton 2.0 Premier Edition. Once a scan is completed again a statement appears saying: Drive C: File system errors, consider running CHKDSK. Drive D: Optimization not required, current disc. Being I'm using Norton I originally thought error may have been able to be corrected by them but was told I had to contact HP. I called HP but wasn't able to conduct Network sharing. Someone told me if I don't fix problem PC could be damaged. I do have a warranty that would cover this and likely could have been taken care of by now. However, as most have heard Circuit City is going out of business and therefore will not continue following through with the customers warranty. From what HP informed me the rep said I could fix the problem on my own but I have no idea how to proceed in doing it. Please can someone help.? Anyone who can assist me with this would gratefully be appreciated.

I hope that made sense because I remember someone telling me that if you download information, you're basically leaving a path between the server and your computer and the server stores your "personal information" (many people don't realize that nobody is out of the clear when you download just because you have a so called screen name) in it's memory. But if you stream, your "personal information" is never recovered because you didn't download from a server. Hopefully this question is clearly stated because it sounds awkward.

I have been using it for a couple of years now. It has windows xp pro, but today I got a virus, I was able to get rid of the virus, but I had to restart my computer. When it finished restarting and I tried to log in, it automatically log out by itself. I thought it was a virus that might still be on my computer, but it is unlikely. I scanned with 3 different anti virus and malware programs and they got rid of it for sure. After some research on the internet, I figure that the virus messed up my Windows. Since I got the computer from someone else, I didn't have the original Windows CD, but the guy made me a copy. So I used the copy and now I have to put in the Certificate of Authenticity which I don't have. Sinse i already set up the Windows, it doesn't log out by itself anymore, so I know that was the problem, but now I have another one. How do I get the Certificate of Authenticity? My dad's friend moved and I can not get the original CD from him. Is there another way to get the Certificate of Authenticity or should I go out and buy a new XP CD. Or should I just get Vista?      If I update the windows, will all my files on computer go away?

20090131185820AAsLoPO	Computers & Internet;Security	Help with a weird virus?	I recently downloaded a game, and afterwards my computer started doing 2 weird things.      1). At random times when i leave my computer going some type of weird ESPN broadcast starts up and i hear it through my speakers. I close all windows and the noise still comes through, and i have to wait for it to end. It doesn't interrupt anything, but it's very creepy      2). At random times when i have a window open it will minimize the window and i have to reopen it. It happened almost 10 times while writing this, also when i have a full screen program open it minimize it at like 3 minute intervals.      Also, i have scanned my computer with trend micro and nothing comes up, however it wasn't a full computer scan so I don't think the virus is really hidden. I have also been getting a message that my computer has detected a spyware infection, and sometimes it asks me if i want to scan my computer, but when i click yes nothing happens.      I don't know if the game i downloaded (it was called mabinogi) gave me the virus, I don't think it did because I've downloaded it before. Anyone who is experienced with viruses and stuff and has any suggestions that'd be great.      Also, my computer is scheduled to conduct a full body scan tonight so don't waste your time by suggesting i get one.

20090131153418AAu8o0R	Computers & Internet;Security	Where can I report suspicious e-mail that is not spam?	I received an e-mail regarding a "business proposition." The money involved is a LOT, more that most people see in their life time. The only problem I have with this e-mail? 1.) I have never heard nor seen this e-mail address in my life, 2.) It asks for personal information that can easily be used as identity theft, 3.) Not many people make business propositions of this magnitude to a seventeen-year-old, which is my age, 4.) They did not use my real name, but a name that I use as user names in online games and places like myspace and facebook. Please know that I am not replying to the e-mail, I just want know where I can report is for being suspicious, because I have a gut feeling that I'm not the only person this message was sent to.

Hi everyone, just recently I realised with all the top spec games that have recently been released such as GTA IV, Far Cry 2 and the sims 3 very soon; I think I need a better CPU (Isn't that the motherboard or something?) and a better video card. I don't want to spend that much money (alot of people say that) upgrading my pc. My current specs are below:      * Product Description: Acer Aspire T180 - Sempron 3200+   * Type: Personal computer   * Form Factor: Mini tower   * Dimensions (WxDxH): 18.3 cm x 45.5 cm x 37 cm   * Localisation: United Kingdom   * Processor: 1 x AMD Sempron 3200+   * RAM:  4 GB (max) - DDR2 OCZ ReaperX   * Storage Controller: Serial ATA   * Hard Drive: 1 x 80 GB - standard - Serial ATA-150   * Optical Storage: DVD±RW (+R double layer)   * Card Reader: 9 in 1   * Monitor: None.   * Graphics Controller: NVIDIA GeForce 6100   * Audio Output: Sound card - 7.1 channel surround   * Networking: Network adapter - Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet   * OS Provided: Microsoft Windows XP Prof      I spent almost 100 quid on ram recently (4GB) to find out XP could only take 2.75 despite me arguing with the woman behind the till saying I didn't think it would take it as it's 32-bit anyway. I did try Windows 7 beta 32-bit and it ran all 4.0GB! So anyway what I'm asking is if I was to run Windows 7 in the future (I will be) what graphics/video card and 'CPU' do you recommend? Nvidia preferably please! I'm asking because I want to be able to run games of similar requirements to Far cry 2. Any help whatsoever appreciated and Thanks in advance!

Okay it's like this (I'll get right to the point)...The guy that reinstalled Windows on my computer set it to where it locks whenever you turn it back on after the screensaver has been on.  I even turned on the Guest account so people like my mom or my best friend could use my computer when I'm not here.  How do I set it to where the computer doesn't lock and it just comes back up to the Windows blue screen where the user accounts are?  I know I can cut the screensaver off but I don't wanna do that.  I'm scared to repair Windows cuz I might lose everything so I'm asking is there another way to do it?  If you don't understand the question, let me know and I'll give you further detail...

20090226074201AADPsFG	Computers & Internet;Security	How to remove virus called 'system.bat'?	This virus entered through a usb in my system. The peculiar thing about it is that whenever i scan my system using the antivirus(avira antivir), it deletes the file. The virus path is shown to be 'C:\Windows\system.bat'   But if i search the windows directory, there is no such file... Also, since this virus has infected my system, a new process called 'iph.exe' has started running... though the process can be terminated, but it starts again once the system.bat file is run...   It also happens that the virus just doesn't delete. Once the antivirus window pops up and i delete it, the next second the window pops up again... and it doesn't disappear until i restart the system...      Although it is not doing any harm currently, it might affect the system in the long run... I have tried scanning through various tools such as 'ad-aware' and 'spybot' but to no avail...       Can anybody guide me how to get rid of it permanently?   Thanks for reading through my query..

20090131184414AAIvOLn	Computers & Internet;Security	Need help getting rid of MS AntiVirus 2009 and AntiSpyware 2009?	Yesterday I kept getting a message from MS Antivirus 2009 telling me that my computer was infected with a whole bunch of virus. It kept popping up every 20 seconds or so. I already have a free antivirus, and I used it to scan my whole computer to see if it was true. The scan found nothing, so I knew that MS Antivirus 2009 had to be a fake. I removed it by using the "add remove programs", and it has stopped popping up, but it is still in my computer. My computer is now going slower than usual. Also when I try to search for something on Google, I get redirected to completely random sites.    I've tried looking at other answers posted here, and I've tried different methods but none of them work. I've downloaded Norman Malware Cleaner and Malwarebyte AntiMalware and ran them while in Safe Mode. I tried downloading SuperAntiSpyware but I keep getting an error message telling me that the system admin has set policies to prevent it, even though I'm the admin. Instead I download SpyBot Search and destroy, and used it to scan my system. All these programs found some problems and removed them, but the problem is still not fixed. I ran them all again, while in safe mode, and according to them, there are no more problem.    So does anybody know how to get rid of this probelm? I know that there must be some way to do it. I'm pretty pissed because I just got this computer a few weeks ago.    Also, try not to send me too many links, because MS Antivirus 2009 prevents me from opening some websites.   Thanks

20090131181213AAgokEc	Computers & Internet;Software	AVG Anti-virus saying it updated when new update wasn't installed. ?	You may or may not have realized this about AVG Anti-virus. Last week for a whole week my AVG could NOT install any new updates because of a BIN file issue, why it wasnt working is not important. Funny thing is about AVG, it said each day the new update WAS installed when that's impossible cause the BIN file issue prevents new updates from being installed. So when I looked at "last update" it actually said a new update WAS installed each day when it was not, because this is when AVG 8.0.233 just came out and yet I still had the older version, meaning no, the updates were not being installed. The database said everything was up to date. So basically, AVG says you get a new update even if you dont like in my case. So unless your like me and check the AVG site to see what the current version is (to be sure you have the newest updates), you might think you are getting the newest updates when your really not.       To fix this, AVG should have in it's program showing when your last update was installed, and when there newest update was released. if both dates match, you know your up to date. And NOT say newest update was installed on your AVG until it actually is.      Anyone notice this and think it should be fixed by AVG?

20090131181638AADAa2B	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	How do I Print these tickets?	I ordered tickets from Movietickets.com.And I got the confirmation e-mail but it says.....   Ticket Pickup Instructions: When you get to the theatre, take your ticket directly to the ticket taker. THERE IS NO NEED TO STAND IN LINE AT THE BOX OFFICE WINDOW. Have your printed ticket ready, and hand it to the ticket taker to have the bar-code scanned. That's all there is to it! IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO PRINT YOUR TICKET FOR SOME REASON, just bring your confirmation number with you to the ticket-taker, explain that you could not print your ticket, and he or she will be able to use that number to validate your purchase and get you into your movie.      I dont know if I can print my tickets,if anyone knows how please tell me.I know it says you can print this and bring it so if i dont get any answers I'll do that.

20090131184545AAkjfLW	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Internet speed is slow over both ethernet connection and excellent wireless connection.?	I have two computers in my house that both run off of a Linksys wireless router. The first one, my sisters', loads webpages at the speed it always has. Lately, however, my laptop takes almost 5 minutes to load even the smallest websites, despite the fact that it says I have an "excellent" connection. I tried plugging an ethernet cable running from my DSL modem directly to my computer, but I get the same results. I've tried chaning the channel that my router transmits on, and everything else I could think of (moving the router, etc). No other device that runs off of the router has any problem either. My PSP and PS3 both run at full speed. Any thoughts?

I have a baby on the way and my wife and I are looking for anyway possible to save money on our monthly bills.  I just saw a news video about a couple who cut out cable completely and use rabbit ears for their local channels and get the rest of their video directly from websites (like fox, NBC, etc) to watch full episodes of their favorite shows.    And what are some of the advantages and disadvantages of doing this?  It seems as if one huge disadvantage is that it takes a long time for shows to get to the website if you miss them over the air.    And what exaclty would I need out of a computer to be able to do this?  My TV is a 56 inch DLP.  My goal is to make this happen with spending as little as possible.  Thanks for your help.

20090131194935AAVT84i	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Should I return my computer to the store?	I bought a Dell desktop today (an Inspiron 5315) and whenever I pop a disc into the CD rom to install software on my computer, the program doesn't start. Nothing pops up. I keep having to click start, run, and type in d: to get the program to start so I'm having to manually get the program to start from the CD in the CD rom. So I was just wondering since I can't get the programs to start whenever I stick a CD into the CD rom and I'm manually having to get the program to start by clicking on run (and I've tried more than one disk), should I go ahead and return the computer and just buy another one? I'm just worried this may get worse and not work at all later and cause a problem later. What should I do?

20090131201459AAVTrMF	Computers & Internet;Security	What is your opinion on Safari for Windows?	I've been an IE user for years and then went to Firefox. When I got my laptop I downloaded Firefox and toggled between the two till IE8 was recently released.  About a week ago I downloaded Safari and I have to admit I have been much more impressed with it than either of the other two.  It is a pretty decent looking browser with quite a few useful options for more intermediate and advanced users.  It has also seems to be much quicker than IE8 of Firefox.  But the biggest and most pleasant aspect that I found so far is that since I started using it I havent had a single pop up, or security warning from my internet security programs.  I run AVG internet security and AVAST! and before they were constantly displaying security pop ups while I surfed.    So so far I have been very impressed and I have never been a fan of Apple products before.  Whats you opinion on it?  Any significant threats or complaints that I should be aware of?

20090131183029AAkj9vk	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Which mini-DVI to Video adapter is better for displaying movies on a macbook to a television?	I have a 13" white mac book with a mini DVI output, and purchased the Dynex (best buy brand) adapter that goes from mini DVI to (both) S-Video and RCA.  I connected it to my television via RCA (didn't have an S-video cable to try it out), and started playing via iMovie.  The image was surprisingly good, however the movie kept freezing up about 1 - 3 minutes into playing.        Now, the movie doesn't freeze when it plays in iMovie on the laptop itself, but whenever I try to use the adapter to the larger television monitor, it'll freeze.  I'm wondering if it's worth it to drive all the way out to the nearest Apple store to purchase the Apple brand mini-DVI to Video adapter.  Is the issue with the quality of the Dynex adapter (I work at Best Buy and know how sub-par Dynex crap can be)?  Could it be the RCA cable I'm using (should I get gold-plated connectors, or a monster cable, for instance)?         Has anyone had this problem with the Apple mini-DVI to Video adapters?      Any help would be appreciated.

20090226081106AAJVD6b	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	HP Pavilion dv2000t CTO - maximum RAM?	Ok, I'm in search of anyone out there that has a real answer...what's the maximum RAM I can use?      HP Pavilion dv2000t CTO   Product: dv2200us   Model: RM669AV   System board: Wistron 30B3 ver 61.66   BIOS: F.3B (4/25/08)      HP and Kensington say 2GB max (correct when this was new)   HP's System Information scan tool says 3GB max   one of HP's business support forums says 4GB max      I know with a 32-bit OS I can't utalize the full 4GB but it'd be nice to know it CAN hold 4GB...         Semi-related, I know my old Dell laptop maxed out at 512MB when it was new, but was eventually upgraded to support 1GB through a BIOS flash.  HP says this is impossible on any computer that the BIOS has nothing to do with the maximum RAM which I find hard to believe.

I personally think that the linux OSes, need to develop their WINE more.      Contact hardware manufactures and software developers to ask them to make a Linux version or to have it open source (hardware manufacturers only)      Make it that the main Linux OS, have a universal installing program. Right now its .rpm for fedora and .deb for ubuntu and Debian.      Promoting Linux operating systems through multimedia platforms (IE: tv, radio, ads)
