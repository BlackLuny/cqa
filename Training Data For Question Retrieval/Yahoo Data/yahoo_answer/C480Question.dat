But when i was sitting on the sofa downstairs my stomach suddenly felt really bad and i started to get lots of saliva.      I went and got some juice coz i thought it was just hunger, i drank the whole glass of sick and had to go to the toilet and throw up.       It was just like say a half a glass of sick. Then i felt a lot better and went and sat downstairs. Then about a half an hour later i felt the same feeling again. So i threw up and this time it was a lot more, say 4 glasses. Yet again i felt a lot better and decided to watch a film.      This time i was definately much better and all i was drinking was water. About and hour and a half later i felt really hungry so i ate like 5 crackers.       And i was fine.       I felt so much better, i had energy, and whatever it was it was gone.

20090202105830AAyue5W	Health;Mental Health	Can you suffer from depression and stress simultaneously?	I have been feeling low for a while, empty, tearful. Some bad thoughts. I feel so bad because I don't want to burden my friends and I try to avoid being with them and when I do not to stay too long periods in case I bring them down. I feel such a failure and so guilty I've felt like this for a long time and after opening up to my Mom recently, she said it could be depression (as she has suffered previously). I don't like my job but my workplace has announced redundancies during the next couple of weeks and I don't want to lose it with the way things are at the moment. My manager makes fun of me, invites others to do the same, calls me arrogant (when I try to ignore him)and then asks why I am upset. I don't know where I stand with him. I have burst into tears a few times at work recently (luckily hiding it quite well) and have starting to drink heavily in the evenings. My Dad was a drinkerand after waking up sick the other day, I decided I should maybe go and see someone. My Doctor thinks it's stress as I told him about my work but not the other stuff and because I can sleep and will run some blood tests for a bunch of stuff. Is it possible to suffer from stress and depression? I feel stupid as I feel I have wasted his time. Is it possible to treat either myself and without feeling like I go round in cycles? Thanks xx

20090203164011AAdea2T	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	I have a concussion, what should I do? Sorry for the long explanation, but help!?	I fell down on Saturday night and hit my head on the leg of a chair. This morning I was in school, and my vision started getting really fuzzy. Really sudden. My periphial vision was messed up. I was writing something, and it took all my concentration and 20 minutes to get two paragraphs done, whereas I am usually a fast writer. And, I couldn't write the letter "V" for some-odd reason.. It was wierd.. So then my eyes started to hurt, like someone was pushing them in. I tried to wait it out, but it was throbbing. We started to watch something on the TV, and my teacher turned the lights off. That seemed to help. We were watching a recording on Fox News - which I normally would have LOOOVVVEEEDDD - but I couldn't watch it. I had been telling my friend what was happening, and she said I should close my eyes. I tried that, but it didn't help. Then the pain started to go to my head. She then said that I need to go to the nurse, but I really didn't want to. Long story short, I went to the nurse, and she said I could go home. I was waiting for my mom to pick me up, laying on the couch in the nurse's office, and I was almost crying it hurt so bad. I have since been home, and have taken Tylenol. It still hurts when I move, especially when I move a bit too fast.      I am pretty sure I have one.  I looked it up, and I only have grade one or something like that. Minor.   So, what should I do? I don't have to go to the hospital, but I think I am going to the doctor tomorrow. So, what should I do until then.. How serious is a concussion.. Tell me everything, please..

20090203164018AAFhOrU	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Itchiness and Irritation on my skin is getting annoying?	I've asked about my itchiness before and now I just want to elaborate some more to see if anyone knows what I have.        I had a sunburn when I was on vacation last July.  My skin peeled. I'm all healed now but I have a feeling that's when it started.  The reason why I'm blaming that is because when I itch, it's at the specific places on my body where I turned red from that sunburn.       The itching or irritation happens when it gets really hot but also when it gets cold.  Lotions don't really help. Here's the funny part. When I get nervous, anxious, embarrassed or scared, it happens too! Like it'll be normal temperature!  Like, for example, I'd walk out to my car and it's a beautiful day and when I realize I forgot my cellphone, as I'm running back in, this irritating itchiness starts happening around my shoulders and knees.  Most annoying thing ever! Right now, I feel fine... Another thing is that sometimes, I get little pimples or pores popping up at the itchy spots and I think it's related.      So has anyone else ever heard of this? What am I to do?

20090203164024AAoEBf2	Health;General Health Care;First Aid	I want it to hurt more?	Ok I asked a question a few days ago about having pain in my lower leg. It originally happened becuase I got nailed just above the ankle by a our #1 Varsity pitcher. Although it is not swollen and it is hardly bruised it still hurts a lot, especially when touched, or when i extend it while sitting or laying down. I know there is probably nothing wrong with it but i am sick of it hurting. I feel like I want it to hurt more, and I want there to be something wrong with it so that it can heal like under a cast or something. Not to mention I have always wanted to be on crutches. I just feel like I am going through this pain that is going to continue unless something is done. I have even prayed that something will happen that will cause it to break so that it can heal. Dont say I should rest it because softball season has started and I am starting Varsity so it is impossible to rest it, we have two a days. I don't know what to do. I want to hurt it more so i can rest it, but i dont know how to. Just maybe somethign that will put me out for like 4 weeks or something. Don't call me a psycho or anything, becasue I am not. I just want it to heal by making it worse so that I can actually go to the doctor and have something be wrong with it. I wouldnt even mind surgery.

I have been getting increasingly sicker and my doctors have done almost every blood and urine test possible and still haven't found the main cause.   I finally have been thinking the worst this week, that maybe my bad dreams of being diagnosed with stomach cancer or a brain tumor (which I haven't told anyone about because I don't want to sound like a hypochondriac) are coming true.      Here are my symptoms ~   *Severe nausea (five years, but in the last year has grown increasingly worse)   *Severe abdominal pain (last few months)   *Loss of appitite and painful boloating after eating (1 year)   *Black stools (past few weeks, I have not taken pepto bismal, ect. for months)   *30lb weight loss in 3 months (unintentional)   *Night fevers (last few months)   *Severe headaces (last few months)   *Dizziness/Fatigue/Blurred vision (last few months)      I am currently taking 25mg Promethagan once a day and 5ml of Zantac twice a day and they helped at first but not any more.      I have had tons of blood tests, some urine tests, and one stool test to test for a bacterial infection. No scans, mris, ect.      I went to a GI doctor before Christmas and he did nothing for me except a blood test for chrones which was negative. At that time I didn't have black stools though. My parents say that I have had almost every blood test possible and nothing is wrong with me. I can't go to the doctor on my own, so how can I get my parents to take me?      What is wrong with me? I just want to get better! Any help is appriciated!

Then in the following years every time I would have to get an immunization or a blood taken I would do the same. I even did it with a TB test. What the heck is wrong with me? I am terrified of needles now for that reason. Could this be some kind of anxiety thing or is it possibly my body rejecting a foreign object? I should also note that I have never had any seizures or passed out any other times. I have also never been diagnosed with epilepsy.

20090202113509AAObM5a	Health;Women's Health	Too tight for pap smear?	Alright, this is going to sound stupid, but I swear, this is a serious question.      I'm 19 and a lesbian, I've been sexually active but aren't at this time. I don't enjoy penetration, so I've never had a sex toy used on me or even more than two fingers. I went for a pap smear today and it was very painful when they inserted the device and the doctor could not open it. He told me that a pap smear wasn't needed if there were no external abnormalities and to just come back for one if I started having hetero sex, but I feel like I should have one.      Is there anything I can do to be less tight other than starting to use a sex toy (which I'd rather not do; I really don't like the feeling)? Maybe some stretches or something?

20090203171212AAUb7gi	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Help on skin rash issues...please can anyone help!!!!?	Ok here is my question. My boyfriend has a skin rash of some sort which randomly showed up a couple weeks ago. What happens is he'll get a rash that will spread up n' down his arms, his legs and will be across his chest and back and sometimes his neck. When he gets this rash it is warmer than his normal body heat. He doesn't even have to do anything to cause it. Sometimes it will just show up when he is sitting around. Even with the slightest damage taken to his body that area will swell up. Like one time i scratched his arm and that section swelled up and also i just drew a small smiley face on his arm and it swelled up in the same pattern the smiley face was drawn. Another factor i'd like to add is ....he is a wrestler and lately when he has been rolling around w/his wrestling partner his body reacts really badly his chest will be all red and some area's swelled up along w/his back. His arms will be red also along w/his neck and his legs will have spots of  red across them. Not to mention when this happens it also itches......!!!  If there is anything else you would like to know about this rash please ask i'm very concerned and i've been doing some research about rashes and nothing seems to fit the situation just right.!! If you know anything please tell me!!!!!

This is because she lives in another country and wanted to visit the U.S. to better her English. I don't really know her, but my parents do, and she's scheduled to stay till March 5.    Recently, many things in the house have suddenly gone "missing". These range from hair clips, to stuffed toys, to CDs, to books...etc. This never happened before she moved in. The other day, I was trying to locate my hair clip, and I found it on "her" nightstand (in "her" room). It was stuffed between all her books and some of her clothes and I found a pack of anxiety pills right by it.    Now, I don't know much about Kleptomania, but don't kleptomaniacs usually have an anxiety problem? Isn't that why they steal? Because of anxiety? Anyone have any insight?

I just came back from my OBGYN, who had run some blood work to find out why I had such irregular, sporadic menstruation and also have been lactating.  He said my prolactin levels are elevated, which could have two causes-      -Sex (and I am sexually active) or,   -A pituitary tumor      He didn't seem very concerned about the possibility of a tumor, because I'm sure it's very rare, but ontop of those gynelogical symptoms I also had epilepsy as a child and currently have problems with my eyes turning red (almost like pink eye) every other week...

He is known to be very sarcastic and out spoken he also has a really short temper & is very hot headed. Despite his apparent co*kiness he is amazing i guess cause i see the 'real' him. My 3 best friends are fond of him but my other friends don't get him at all and ask me why i am with him, i try to make them see but they refuse to. My family are the same except for my 2 brothers who are detectives with NYPD my other brothers are part of the FDNY and they hate him.(The service job goes way back in my family) I hate the tension that's going on. I am 25 years old(my fiance is 30) & this shouldn't bother me but it does.

20090202150051AA5pib7	Health;Women's Health	Girls...my girlfriend's kind of embarrassed about this and she needs some help...?	And its not just with oral. Whenever she's eating something and it tastes bad, she starts gagging. She hates ketchup, so just the sight of it makes her start gagging and once, she threw up. But when were doing oral, she was BURPING, GAGGING, and DROOLING a little even before we began but she said that she could do it and she tried to focus and breath through her nose. I tried talking to her while she was doing it, but then, it happened: she threw up. Now, she's all embarrassed and everything. I've tried a lot of others things like shaving my pubes and somebody even suggested to masturbate in front of her to show her how only the tip has to be worked. To help with the taste, I've been told to dip it into whipped cream or chocolate and have her lick it off and maybe do like a little ritual with the dipping. Would that work?      (Please don't answer: Don't do oral or don't gag her with your penis. I've addressed both of these issues.)

Basically about a week ago my foot hurt a bit from the base of my big toe to where everyone has a sort of lump on their foot about half way up nearer the inside of your foot (feel your foot now and you will know what I mean!)

You could feel it faintly if you put your hand on top. My friend screamed.      It happened for about a week and I thought it would go away. It didnt bother me too much because it didnt hurt at all.      But today it snowed a lot and I ran around in it a bit. Now it feels bruised and really really hurts on top. It is swollen around the lump on the top of my foot (like I explained at the beginning). What is wrong with me?!

20090202150537AAvpHiT	Health;Mental Health	Is my partner mentally ill ?	I have been with my partner for two years now. I have known her for three. Let me start by saying I have a lot of experience working in the mental health field. For three and a half years I worked with the most sever mentally ill clients in San Francisco. Every thing you can think of I have seen. But I must say the symptoms that my partner are having do not fit with any of the mental health diseases. She is 24 years old. For as long as she can remember she has been hearing these voices, and not in her head. She describes them as an unseen person. Not someone in her head talking to her. She has described for sure a man and women. May be two men, they are not clear and most of the time they are whispers. When I asked her if she can remember what they say all she could tell me for sure is that the women talks the most and she calls out her name, Asks her what she is doing. The most disturbing part is that she said at times the voices seem angry and then she feels angry for no reason. My partner is afraid to be alone at home because she sees shadows and feels as if she is being watched.  Other than her hearing stuff she has NO other symptoms. I have looked up every thing but none of the symptoms match. I do not know if this is helpful but she used to dabble in the occults. Spirit boards, black magic things that she should not have been   messing with.

I'm confused because I saw a pamphlet in my dentist office, and it said to use toothpaste with fluoride in it for children 2 and older.  Do I really need to do this yet?  My son is 2, but  still eats the toothpaste no matter how much we practice spitting it out.  I have read that the amount of fluoride in toothpaste  is not good to swallow.  Isn't the fluoride in the tap water enough?  Can't I just use the training toothpaste til he turns three years old?

I have been consistently taking adderall most every week day since I was in 9th grade, so almost 10 years. I am prescribed 70 mgs a day but do not always take that much. My blood pressure has always been high and also runs in my family. My doctor recently stopped filling my adderall because of my blood pressure which was consistently 150/115. I bought a heart rate monitor and have not taken any adderall since Friday and it is now almost Tuesday. My blood pressure has not changed. I also however have been sleeping for the past 3 days, not exercised, not done any homework, and basically cannot keep living like this. Will my doctor let me have my prescription back once she sees it isn't the adderall that causes my blood pressure to be high? Its really stressing me out, which also isn't good for the blood pressure! I don't know how else to find answers and I found this forum. Please write back, any information/advice would be helpful. Thanks a lot.
20090202152424AAI2US8	Health;Mental Health	It SCARES me how people have SIMILAR SLEEP PARALYSIS events?????!!!?	I had sleep paralysis not long ago, it only lasted for about 10 seconds but wasn't very nice. I did not see any bad things though.      What i cant understand is that many people during their sleep paralysis have VERY SIMILAR events.   For example: Many people say there is an 'old hag' in the room or someone a devil perhaps sitting on your chest.      I just cant understand how different people can have the same events when all our minds are different with different belives and fears etc.      I have read scientifically that sleep paralysis happens because the mind wakes before the body and i can accept that but it scares me why different people have the same event in there episode with a scary angry man or a demon or an old hag.      How can people see the same things???      Please give some suggestions thank you.

Ive recently started going to a gym that has a lot of machines available, I've been eating a lot (a lot of good food, no grease), and I've started drinking Whey Protein shakes, but I'm looking for some general tips, like what exercises to do that are very effective (keep in mind I have a gym at hand with lots of equipment), what food to eat, what food to NOT eat, and how much/how often to drink the protein shakes.    All help appreciated!

20090202154012AANs0Sv	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	I injured my foot a year and a half ago. long story, but i'm having circulation problems. vascular surgeons Q?	i'm being referred to a vascular surgeon. i have infection now, a deep one, possibly being osteomyltis (infection in bone), or gangrene. i know the triple phase bone scan was not good. one foot and leg was greyish whit while the other one had a lot of very dark black in it.      my question is, what should i expect for this initial appointment with a vascular surgeon? what common test procedures should i expect?      please give me the real deal. this is coming up quickly and i need to mentally prepare. i've been living a nightmare for so long now. i've just had enough. the surgery that was performed started the nerve damage. i didn't have any before..and the health care system let this bad injury go from june 30th of 2007, and i'm still dealing with it.      anyone who can help me with this..it's not about points, though i'll give ten stars to the best answer. i just need some reassurance i guess.   thank you.
20090202154025AA5xQvV	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Info on celiac disease...not sure if i may have it. would like feedback from people with CD?	well today has not been a good day for me, to put it nicely. i randomly remembered that a distant friend of mine has CD. i decided to do some researching on wikipedia. a lot of the symptoms caught my eye. i have always been VERY skinny all of my life (i'm 20) and have never weighed over 100 lbs. the past week i noticed i was losing weight, as it seemed. i will admit i haven't been eating very good lately, but it really scared me. i'm usually around 90-95, but am getting into the high 80's. i saw one of the symptoms is inability to absorb nutrients and such. could this be why i have never gained weight properly? i also read somewhere that repetitive damage to the small intestine could cause lactose intolerance, which is what happened to me this past summer (not officially diagnosed, but i think i figured it out). i always just thought this was the reason for my discomfort. for those that have CD, what were your symptoms and how did you get tested for it? i am afraid because my mother has always denied there's been anything wrong with me (not necessarily CD, i haven't even mentioned it to her, i just mean in general) and i feel that she would think i was being ridiculous. i am asking for some feedback, opinions, comments, questions, whatever and that i greatly appreciate anything!!

Today it went from bad to worse. For a whole 45 minutes I held tissues to my nose, waiting for it to stop, but everytime I looked to see, it keep bleeding. It wasn't a stream of blood, but it was a good a mount of blood. So when I waited 45 minutes, pinching my nose, I looked, and sure enough it did stop. So I blew my nose, and I felt a huge clot in the way. I blow it a little more and I see a clot hanging from the nose. I pull it and out comes a huge blood clot, probably the half size of a baseball. It was huge. I just want to know if a vein burst, or something like that. If anybody could tell me why a massive build up of blood like this happens it would help.

The guy that I am dating, has a 7 yr old son diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder. I care deeply for this man and was hoping to marry him. However, his son's behavior worries me.

He poops his pants and sticks his hands down his pants, grabs the poo and throws it on people or smears it on walls, etc.      I have a 14 yr old son, and whenever my boyfriend's son is around us he is always violent toward my son and myself. I am fearful that he will seriously hurt one of us or himself. I am a nervous wreck evertyime I am around him.      His Father tries to control the situation and constrains the child when he is in a wild rage... but it is a constant battle.

Anyway, we dragged it onto the boat and wanted to take a picture before throwing it back in, so my friend is holding the tail of the shark, letting it dangle vertically. I was next to him. The shark was flailing around a lot and suddenly, its jaws came to my crotch and snapped shut. It was the most painful thing I have ever felt and everyone grabbed the shark to get it off, but it wouldn't open its jaws. They had to repeatedly stab it with a knife in order to loosen the jaws. We quickly went back home and now I am sitting here with my penis 80% severed. There is a small amount of flesh keeping it connected, but it is bleeding severely and I have wrapped it in paper towels. What should I do? I still have an extreme penile shark bite sensation

20090202160911AAXmEfQ	Health;Mental Health	In desperate need of a psychoanalysis!?	About two months ago my boyfriend broke up with me. We were together for almost a year and we gave each other our virginity. We loved each other... up until the breakup apparently. I've had a hard time getting over him but now I am and I have a little problem. I have a crush on a guy. Healthy, I know. Ok, he's a senior and I'm only a sophomore. I'm sixteen and he's like eighteen. That's not too bad I guess. So here's the problem. I'm white and he's Asian. I've never believed in interracial relationships for myself. I don't care that other people do it but personally I wouldn't. Or apparently I would. I think that's a pretty dramatic change of my habits/ preferences. Does anyone know why such a random, yet dramatic, change happened?

I'm skinny, and this height and weight leaves me with a BMI of 15.2, which is underweight (16 considered the borderline for underweight)   The reason i am skinny and underweight is because I never work out or excersize, and i am picky and don't eat much, and just sit and play games all day. What can i do to fix this? At our house we have some 5lb and 8lb dumbells that i can work with. My family also has a gym membership so we can go there and use the machines etc. Sometimes my mom makes meals i dont like, so i eat a little bit until im not full. I want to gain some muscle weight, so i'll look better      so yesterday i decided to devise a plan to do 100 pushups a day      I did that yesterday easily in an hour, sets of 8 or 10      today i tried and i felt horribley sore, what should i do?      thanks, also will pushups train all my muscles? or should i do other things      what should i eat and how should i workout? thanks

The drug I am referring to (salvia divinorum), is a psychedelic, and it's harmless, legal, and not addictive, and yes I did the research for this from multiple sources, including a documentary exploring the effects of the drug.      I explained this to my friend but she still sees it the same way she sees harmful drugs and automatically assumes I'm gonna ruin my life or something, even though I wouldn't go anywhere near a harmful substance(such as cocaine, meth, heroine, etc), I haven't even done it in over 3 months, they weren't kidding when they said it was non addictive, you can't crave it, you're either interested in it, or not.      So ANYWAYS, why are people like this? I even consider both caffeine and alcohol WAY more harmful than this stuff. But yet my friend still frowns upon my use of this substance o.O What are your thoughts on this situation? if you knew a friend of yours was using this stuff and they explained to you that it was safe,harmless AND legal, would you still frown upon them for using it?

Both of my parents are prescribed pain pills.. but my father can contol his for the most part.       My mother used to come to high school events high. Other parents would have to drive us home.. She has been in accidents.. and I think even taken to jail once for driving while under the influence of pills (I was young so I dont remember).      Im close to both of my parents but more so my mom. Im an only child and this has been the topic of many extreme fights between my family since I was old enough to realize what it was. This has devastated me. I actually used to call it my mom being in one of her "moods" when I was younger cuz I didnt know.       So here is my question. My mom will not get help. I have tried everything in the book from being encouraging to not speaking to her. Nothing works! Nothing! My dad knows she has a problem but he wont leave her (not that thats what I want at all I just think it will make a great impact that if this continues she'll be all alone with nothing) and he actually kind of "sweeps it under the rug" or tries to down play it to me. Please help.. what can I do? Im so exhausted from having this same problem. I feel like I have two different moms. The sober one and the high one. Its RUINING our relationship. Please help. Something has to change.      Please please please help me. Im desperate to get my mom back. I hate this!      Thanks for any advice!!

She's in the seventh grade, and whenever she comes home, she tells me about how this popular guy asked her to take a smoke with him, and about how everyone talks about drinking, and I believe her. I went by her school with a few friends, once, and on the way there, I saw a guy smoking. The smoking isn't going on at the school, and I know she isn't gonna actually do it ever, (hopefully) but what are some tips to keep her away from it?

I'm 23 & I'm completely at a loose end with acne :( I never had overly good skin during my teenage years but it was just hormones & never really bad then I went on hols in summer 07 & i noticed it startin to get progressively worse but for months never thought it was actually acne, my GP prescribed creams like Duac which I now know aren't enough alone then in about March 08 he prescribed Tetralysyl which I took for 6 months along with using Differin cream then i changed to Acnecide, I came out to Oz in Aug 08 & finished my course of tablets the next month & I had expected them to have worked by then! But they haven't & now I'm out here travelling around with red, blotchy, disgusting skin, I get so upset every time I look in the mirror. I went to a GP here & I'm now taking some type of antibiotics along with a hormonal pill & its still not making a blind bit of difference (i fear for the effects all of these tablets are having on my insides also!). What does all of this mean? Why hasn't anything worked? I've heard of the medication Roactin,does anyone have any experience of it & how does it work? Is there anything anyone can tell me to make me feel better about having this disgusting condition?! thanks so much for ur help.

I work out for an hour each morning before school in superfit (it's a course offered at my school where we do things like runs, weights, circuits, plyometrics and all sorts of good heart pumping stuff) My problem is not exercising because of superfit and i walk home every day, cross country ski, ski downhill. That sort of thing.       I'm just not sure what to eat during the day (I want to lose 15 pounds, or at least looks more toned by summer because I do know muscle weighs more than fat)       This is what i usually eat in a day (ish)   - a muffin, oatmeal, toast, or some cheerios or shredded wheat before superfit   - a yogurt ( one of those 45 calorie ones) and a banana after superfit   - a muffin or  home made granola bar and an unsweetened applesauce for a snack   - Usually PB and J and some carrots and almonds usually   - grapefruit and popcorn after school (air popped plain)   * I have issues when I get home from school because I often just eat and eat and eat so much (like a lot) I'm not hungry for supper       What can I do after school to stop eating so much?   Any tips what to eat around superfit?   Any more tips on what I should eat through the day (like more of one thing less of another?)      Oh I'm a vegetarian      Thank you I know this is a long question, but your answers will help me a lot!      oh i'm 5'8" and 150 pounds and would like to get back to 135 ish (thats what I was before summer, I just started eating a lot over the summer, and am having troubles getting back)

20090202163047AA5gRNH	Health;Other - Health	Do I have Skin cancer / melanoma?	 http://i518.photobucket.com/albums/u346/...       ^^ thats my mole.       I have a mole on my back that is causing me trouble. And I think I may have melanoma. I have apt. this friday with the doctor. But was looking to get some insight now. Below is what the sympotoms are suppose to be. I have a yes or no beside it as to whether or not I have that symptom. Do you think I have it?      Yes- * A is for asymmetry. One half of the mole or skin growth doesn't match the other half.      Yes- * B is for border irregularity. The edges are ragged, notched, or blurred.      Yes. Brown and tan- * C is for color. The pigmentation is not uniform. Shades of tan, brown, and black are present. Dashes of red, white, and blue add to the mottled appearance. Changes in color distribution, especially the spread of color from the edge of a mole into the surrounding skin, also are an early sign of melanoma.      Yes- * D is for diameter. The mole or skin growth is larger than 6 mm (0.2 in.) or about the size of a pencil eraser. Any growth of a mole should be of concern.      Signs of melanoma in an existing mole include changes in:      Yes. Thickening. -* Elevation, such as thickening or raising of a previously flat mole.      No- * Surface, such as scaling, erosion, oozing, bleeding, or crusting.      Yes. My mole is on my back and all around it is red and itchy. almost like a rash - * Surrounding skin, such as redness, swelling, or small new patches of color around a larger lesion (satellite pigmentations).   * Sensation, such as itching, tingling, or burning.   * Consistency, such as softening or small pieces that break off easily (friability).      Melanoma can develop in an existing mole or other mark on the skin, but it often develops in unmarked skin. Although melanoma can grow anywhere on the body, it frequently occurs on the upper back of men and women and on the legs in women. Less commonly, it can develop on the soles, palms, nail beds, or mucous membranes that line body cavities such as the mouth, the rectum, and the vagina.5      Many other skin conditions (such as seborrheic keratosis, warts, and basal cell cancer) have features similar to those of melanoma.   Later symptoms      Later signs of melanoma include:      No. - * A break in the skin or bleeding from a mole or other colored skin lesion.      Yes. - * Pain in a mole or lesion.      Symptoms of metastatic melanoma may be vague and include:      No. - * Swollen lymph nodes, especially in the armpit or groin.   No. - * A colorless lump or thickening under the skin.   Yes. - * Unexplained weight loss.   No. - * Gray skin (melanosis).   No. * Ongoing (chronic) cough.   Yes. -* Headaches.   No. -* Seizures.

We pretty much fell in love over a wonderful weekend..it was like a movie.  Everything seemed perfect.  He's perfect for me.  He's everything I've ever wanted in a partner, and I'm definitely done with the dating scene.     All of a sudden I started thinking about this guy I had a crush on before I met the guy I'm with now.  I question myself ALL of the time about being with the right person, and i'm constantly comaring my relationship I'm in now with my "what would be relationship" with the old crush.     I'm freaking out!  It really bothers me, and often brings me to tears.  I just had my hormones checked today...so I'm waiting on that.     I've talked to my mom and my best friend, and no one seems to know why I've been having these weird thoughts.     I just feel like I'm obsessing and I don't know how to stop. I even question if God is trying to tell me I'm supposed to be with this guy I used to have a crush on, but the guy I'm with now is a much better match for me.     I know I'm rambling and probably not making any sense, but I'm hoping someone will be able to see where I'm coming from...sorry!  Everything just seemed to go from perfect to impending doom for no reason but my own retardedness....help me please.

My four year old developed a fever yesterday and also had a sore throat and bellyache.  She caught this from a couple of children that are in her preschool class.

She doesn't have any spots on the back of her throat or anything like that.  This is the first time this has ever happened to her.  I read that it could be due to constipation or dehydration, and I really don't see how it could be a yeast infection.  If anybody has had something similar to this please respond!  Thanks in advance!

Yea, i binge and purge, but it's obviously not hurting me like it does other bulimics.  Other girls break ribs and vomit blood.    Maybe it's because i don't need to gag myself, i;ve been doing it so long i can just vomit.    This will seem very vulgar and ridiculous to people without EDs,  my apologies.

It is winter time here in Canada and for some reason, every time I sleep in my boyfriends bed with him and leave one piece of clothing on (shirt or pants) I really over heat and I start to really sweat. Some times I wake up in a pool of sweat.    It is odd because when I start off going to bed I am always cold and need my boyfriend to help warm me up but he always tells me to take off my clothes or I will sweat in his bed. We end of falling asleep facing away from each other so we are not acutely near each other.       So why do I over heat and sweat in my sleep during the winter but I am always cold during the day?   Why is this?      (PS. He is not wanting me to take off my clothes just to be a perv)

20090202115652AAmD6oU	Health;Other - Health	Mold Exposure...5 years ago?	About 5 years ago, I moved into a mobile home that was in a flood zone.  What I didn't know then, but do now, is that most of the homes that were not completely destroyed were simply repaired (Yes, it is owned by slum lords).  When I moved in, I noticed what looked like particle board all over the yard, but I didn't think anything of it.  We had major flooding here and as it turns out the place I rented was one that wasn't completely destroyed.  I noticed it had a smell to it, but I trusted the landlord and he told me that the place had been empty for awhile, and that the smell would eventually go away.  We stayed there for 7 months, and if anything, the smell only got worse.  It was a strong mildewy stench that stunk up our clothes no matter how often we washed them, our hair always stunk, and we were plagued with constant colds, allergies and respiratory infections.  I was young then and was just glad that I found such a bargain.  Well, for reason's I won't get into, the police came to my house and the first thing they mentioned was the smell.  After about 10 minutes just standing in the doorway, most had to go outside to get some fresh air.  That's when I started thinking there might be a connection to our illnesses and the smell.  One of the officers mentioned black mold and told me that I really needed to get it checked out.      About a month after moving in, I began suffering from headaches. I've been out of the dump for about 5 years, but I am still suffering headaches, and they recently started getting worse.  I've tried to look up whether exposure would cause these ongoing headaches, but so far no luck.  I am going to be seeing a neurologist, but until then I wanted to know if anyone else has dealt with this or heard of anything like this?

20090202120650AABpmXA	Health;Other - Health	Is anxiety related to marijuana permanent?	I first smoked weed about 5-6 years ago... I did it really really loosely (maybe once a month, if that) until about a couple months ago... then I seemed to get a little lonely so I started to pretty heavily (once every other day or once a day)      Then one day I was smoking with my friend, felt a little nauseous which scared me a good amount, so I got up to go to the bathroom just to be safe, and passed out on the way there (I was feeling very jittery and nervous because of the nauseous feeling)... then my friend got me up, I went to the bathroom, and then felt perfectly fine (save for a couple jitters) maybe as much as a minute later      Then maybe two weeks later, I had to travel out of town and lost a lot of sleep (I was on maybe two hours of sleep)...I went to have lunch with my mom and ended up throwing up in the bathroom...slept in the car for about an hour and then threw up when I got back on campus...      Then maybe a couple weeks later, it was a day before I went on vacation, and I was short on sleep again (probably to the same extent) and it ended up being pretty much the same deal -- I threw up, slept for an hour or two, threw up again, and then slept and felt better...but then this time when I went on vacation, I completely lost my appetite for 2-3 days, and between the vomiting a couple days prior, and the lack of appetite, I lost about 10-15 lbs in a couple days      needless to say, this scared my parents, and they took me to the doctors... by the time the doctors saw me, it had been a month or so since my last incident, and he said that everything was fine and he doubted anything was wrong (this doctor was at Johns Hopkins, so he was no slouch)      However, after the last instance, I never really fully recovered my appetite -- I gained back probably 4-5 lbs, but it was hard to eat full meals and everything...      Then a month or so later I was smoking with some friends I hadnt seen in a long time, and had another [self-diagnosed] panic attack...I went to the bathroom for the same nauseous feeling, dropped to the ground (i never lost consciousness, but lost control of my body), and then threw up 10 minutes later... then felt perfectly fine      After this time I stopped smoking (now for about a month and a half), and I got my appetite back (its great actually enjoying meals for the first time in 4 months), gained back another 10 lbs (back to normal, or maybe even above normal, weight), and my anxiety has pretty much gone away      now my question is... is my brain permanently scarred of this anxiety? Will I ever be able to enjoy weed again? or will I forever have these feelings of anxiety/panic attacks whenever I get high?  I will probably never go back to smoking as much as I did then (I probably couldnt even if I wanted to), but I wouldnt mind getting high once a month, if that, just for shits and giggles

20090202121543AALpWX6	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	My father's hip and lower back pain not diagnosised?	Hi I don't know where to go about this.  My father was admited into the ER last Saturday complaining about lower back and hip pain. He has had a history of Staph infections so his general practice doctor didn't want to risk another infection.      While in ER they took Xrays and did a MRI on his hips and lower back but found nothing.       My father insists that he is suffering more pain than he ever had before and has not been able to get to his feet by himself because he is in pain and doesn't have the strength to do so.       Without finding any reason for the pain the doctor wants my father to under go physical therapy. My mother and I both feel there has to be something wrong or why is he in such pain?      We also don't feel the current doctor is doing much to help my father. When we fist met her she complained of being too overwhelmed with new patients and didn't have time to look at my dad's chart or xrays.       My dad is in the hospital right now and I am trying to get him with another doctor but we don't know what to do.  I think they are giving him a CAT scan soon.       I'm reaching out to the Yahoo community looking for advice. Does anyone here have any suggestions as to what we should do? The doctor is giving my dad morphine since he hurts so much but other than that they don't seem to know what to do.  I know the best people to talk to is a doctor but this doctor doesn't seem to know what to do. I am hoping to change him to a new doctor but in the mean time does anyone have any suggestions on what tests I can suggest the doctor try?       Maybe we should try and get a second opinion?  If so how do you do this? Admit him to a new hospital?      Any advice?       Thanks!

20090202165719AAZkjbm	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Could I have Hashimoto's?	Hi all.       I'm 5'1 and 130 pounds, and trying to lose about 20 pounds. I've been exercising consistently since May of 2008. Over the summer, I worked out with a trainer a couple times a week and did about 45 minutes of cardio a day (usually elliptical) or one to two group fitness classes each day (step, cardio kickboxing, or cycling). My diet is extremely healthy and controlled.       I went to my doctor to get tested for hypothyroidism and my levels were in the normal range, but leaned more toward hypothyroidism. My doctor told me to eat 1200 calories a day, and then later advised me to 1000 calories. Even eating this little amount and exercising as much as I was, I still couldn't lose weight or tone up.       I am continuing to have the same problem - frequent workouts, healthy diet, and no results. I have some symptoms of Hashimoto's - frequently cold, pale skin, puffy face at times, and symptoms of depression.       Does anyone have Hashimoto's or know more about it that could tell me if this could be a possibility?
