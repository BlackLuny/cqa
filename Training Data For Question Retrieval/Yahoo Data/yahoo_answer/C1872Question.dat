20090307180451AAUpqXy	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Help with newly added HDD?	I have just added a secondary hard drive to my computer ( both HDDs have windows XP standard edition on them.)    Now, whenever I boot the computer, it goes through the Compaq screen, then displays the message: The following configuration options were automatically updated:    Disk 1: [36864], Disk 4:  CD-ROM.   After that the computer resets and repeats the message a few more times before showing a black screen with the underscore blinking at the top left.    I have removed the new hard drive and it boots windows normally (with the exception of an unknown D: drive in My Computer), but when both are in, on the BIOS screen it only shows the new disk as the secondary drive, with the CD-ROM at first. What could the reasoning be, and a possible solution, this is my first installation of a hard drive, so it may be fairly obvious... please respond if I forgot to add anything or more details are needed.

Please Help Me!      It is a windows form program that deals with stack data structures or LIFO Lists.  What the program originally did was take a infix operation and change it to postfix.  Now I have added textboxes so the user can input a value for a, b, c and d.  The values are to be used to come up with a value (solution) and post it to the value textbox.  The solution comes from the computer evaluating the postfix expression.        I have an operandStack and I'm supposed to Pop off two value into value1 and value2  ---- Here is the code:      private void ProcessPostfixOperator(char postfixCh)         {             double value1 = 0.0, value2 = 0.0, calc = 0.0;             while (!operandStack.Empty)             {                 value2 = operandStack.Pop();                 value1 = operandStack.Pop();                              }                                   switch (postfixCh)         {           case '*':           calc = value1*value2;  break;           case '+': calc = value1+value2;  break;           case '-':  calc = value2-value1;  break;           case '/':          calc = value2/value1;  break;         }         I could have done something else in the program that would cause this....who knows.  It won't put the value popped off of the operandStack into the value1 and value2 because what gets popped off is an object and value1 and 2 are doubles.  Please someone help me.  If you need more of the program to help me then give me your email and I'll send it to you.   My email address is bombay64836@yahoo.com         Thanks

It said something like 2.2GHz intel core 2 duo for vista.  I was wondering if I got a 2.6 quad core phenom processor from AMD, would that be plenty?        Also, I'm debating between a 2.6 and a 3.0 but the 3.0 won't be compatible with DDR3 so I'm wondering if DDR3 is worth it or not.
20090227092947AAGEfJG	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Can anyone tell me how to set up a network to transfer a large file from my desktop to my laptop?	Right here's the thing, I need to transfer a very large file (World of Warcraft, as an idea of just how big) to my laptop. And I figured the easiest (and cheapest) way to do this would be to set up a network connecting my desktop to my laptop.      The problem is, I don't even know where to begin. So could anyone tell me what to do?      And if you're wondering why I don't just install WoW onto my laptop, it's because there's a scratch the size of the San Andreas Faultline on one of my disks, which is causing the updates to fail.

20090227093838AASQoTE	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Does DSL Extreme means  Extremely slow? or is deceiving advertisement.?	My  ISP (DSL EXTREME),  says  their basic DSL service has  speeds up to,  768 kbps/ 368 kbps.   My modems  show  as the  maximum speed  224 kbps/128 kbps.   But  when  I test the speed  it  only  runs  at  176 kbps  the download.  There are no problems with the line  I had  ATT before running  al very  high  speed, I'm in Los Angeles in a  centric commercial / residential area.  I know  no  ISP is perfect,  ATT had slow periods and down times every night after 9pm. All the  speed test  were done also with a  Linux OS as well as with Windows XP. According to  what is  known  as basic DSL running  very slow going at speeds of about 280 kbps, but  DSL extreme is just  too slow and I fill is  just falsely claiming their service is good  and  cheap. It's probably the  cheapest but also the slowest. That's what they mean by  Extreme,  Extremely Slow.
20090307182926AABxM2k	Computers & Internet;Software	Hey, just got my Macbook back  and iLife's not there?	So, my hard drive failed and I have my MacBook back. It was in the Apple Store for about a week. None of my data is on, but I've noticed something strange. When I first got my MacBook last year, it came with iMovie, iPhoto, GarageBand, and everything from iLife. None of that's on. It says that I would need to buy the full version, but I don't see why I should pay for something that was originally on my computer. I just don't see why it wouldn't be on here if iLife '08 was on my computer when I first purchased it.

20090227094912AAJDRCp	Computers & Internet;Security	Virus help please....?	Hey,      Im pretty sure i have a virus on my laptop. i downloaded an .exe program before i could realize my mistake, and the problems started straight away.      First, i couldn't access my C drive, but i used Autorun Eater to fix this. Then the "svchost.exe" error message is constantly appearing, and after a few clicks of the X, my laptop crashes or the "theme" of XP is half the old, grey block one, and half of the blue theme.      I cant connect to the internet at all anymore. At first i was able to do a few searches but then the pages just kept re-directing until there was no connection at all. There's no desktop icon for the connection either, and the "connect to" option on the start menu is gone. i cant even create a new network, i just get an error message.      Iv run avast on a full scan twice and in safe mode but it didnt pick up anything. ive tried the "last known config" option too but this didnt do anything.      if you read this far, thank you!.      how the hell do i fix this??

I went on the link and guess what? it was a porn site, once i realized i shut down the window IMMEDIATELY. Even if I was on for a few seconds, could I still have gotten a virus?

It didn't used to do this. And If I did get a virus, is it possible for like my family or someone else to find out HOW i got it?

Let me explain the situation:      A couple months ago, I started producing a comic that I used my HP Pavilion to create and Adobe Photoshop to polish. I thought what I had was a decent finished product, so I sent it to a couple of my friends.      They told me that the image was choppy and looked I had cut & pasted with windows paint and I had NO idea what they meant until I looked at the same image on a computer at school. It looked pretty bad, almost all my shading and the cuts & pastes I had made with the image looked blaringly obvious.      Any idea if this is a problem with my monitor or how to fix it? I've heard people tell me hat it's because I'm using a PC instead of a mac for art production, but I don't entirely believe that.      Let me stress that it has nothing to do with my actual skills in the programs, my problem is that the same image on my computer and on other computers do not look the same

Here is the entire question:      Write a method public static char toUpperCase(char ch) that if ch is a lowercase letter, the method will return the corresponding uppercase letter, and if ch is any other character, it will return that character. Assign the string consisting of "My country tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing" to the variable s and using toUpperCase() in a for loop, copy s to a string t such that that each word in t begins with an uppercase letter. So the resulting string would be "My Country Tis Of Thee, Sweet Land Of Liberty, Of Thee I Sing." Print the string t. Note that more than one blank can separate words.      And here is what I have so far:      public static char toUpperCase(char ch)    {     if(ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z')     {      return (char)(ch - 32);     }     else     {      return (char)(ch);     }    }    public static void main(String[] asd)    {     String s = "My country tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing";     int len = s.length();     for(int j = 0; j  = 1 && s.charAt(j-1) == ' ' )      {       System.out.print(toUpperCase(ch));      }      else      {       System.out.print(ch);      }     }    }          This actually works, and does return 'My Country Tis Of Thee, Sweet Land Of Liberty, Of Thee I Sing,' but by printing ch, and not by assigning it to a new string t.      How do I assign the new ch to the string t?      Thanks everyone!

Usually it repeats this about three times before stopping altogether, and failing to recognize the CD. I was wondering what's wrong with the drive, how much it might run me to replace/fix, and if I should invest in an external drive?      Thanks!

20090227093024AAuqHhd	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Limited or no connectivity when connecting to a switch.?	Internet connections works fine when I connect the internet feed directly from data jack to PC but when I connect the internet feed to a 5 port switch, then take another cable from the switch to PC, I'm getting limited or no connectivity.  (slot 1 - internet, slot 2 - cable to PC).  Slot 1 led lights are not coming on, but slot 2 does.  When I did this same set up for another user, it works fine.  I get both led lights on for slots 1 and 2.  Also, when I connect the internet feed to the switch, my network connections are coming up firewalled.  Ive tried turning off firewall but still no success.  Once again, this setup was done for another user with no problems.
20090227093449AAqmgRb	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	How do you load a computer that won't turn on?	My laptop won't even turn on. I have a dell 2200. Let me start off to say that I have never had any problems with it before. This is what happened:      I left my laptop on overnight and woke up to see that it was off. At first I thought it lost charge, but when I turned it on after windows started, I saw it had full power. I got the message windows recovered from a serious error. I was trying to finish a paper real fast, but I got annoyed because I was trying to type and only every 4th or 5th letter was coming on the screen... so I clicked restart. And it started to reboot, but just when windows was going to load the whole computer shut off. It won't turn on.      Is there an easy way to load the computer? If not, I do have the same EXACT model laptop (that I attempted to have my friend fix the DC jack because it wouldn't charge and now won't boot windows). So I do have a lot of parts if i had to replace anything... if it came down to that. I'm looking for the simplest way.       ANY advice as to why it happened, or how to fix it would be greatly appreciated.

20090307183113AAvvb4V	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Why does Firefox sometimes bookmark my pages when I simply click on the Bookmark tab?	It's really annoying.      I've been a longtime Internet Explorer user, but the latest version if Internet Explorer had been too unstable on my Vista operating system, and crashed often. So, I downloaded Firefox, and though I find it less user-friendly, it's been very stable so far.      However, part of the bookmark annoyance is that sometimes (but even more annoyingly, not all the time, so I don't know when it will do it and when it won't) when I click on the Bookmark tab between History and Tools, rather than open the bookmarks it'll bookmark whatever page I'm on, which it goes without saying I had no reason to bookmark. Then I have to manually remove this bookmark that Firefox forced on me.      I'm using Firefox 3.0.7, and when I looked in the Help, I couldn't find what I was looking for.

After installing Keylogger will you be able to see what has previously been typed into the computer (before you ever installed keylogger). Or will you only be able to see what has been typed from the point you installed keylogger and on? Thanks!

I bought Dell Inspiron 1420, in December(bought it at BEST BUY), and towards the end of February it crashed on me while I was doing my homework. But even before it crashed, it kept shutting down on me when I used Firefox, maybe because I downloaded the quicktime player and it came with itunes and stuff. I guess it didn't download properly because it crashed on me and now my computer is messed up. I tried restarting my whole computer but almost every time I try to reinstall everything it keeps showing the ERROR messages and telling me to place the disk back inside and do the same thing I had done before. At one point it did manage to load everything and show my new desktop, BUT after 5 minutes or so the blue screen with ERROR shows again and restarts my whole computer!  I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO, I REALLY NEED HELP!       ALSO, IF I HAVE TO TAKE IT TO BEST BUY TO GET IT FIXED, HOW MUCH DOES IT COST ON AVERAGE?

I've been trying for atleast half an hour and I have no idea what she's talking about. I found the tab at the top and center aligned and everything, but when I hightlight the words, then center align it, enter.. nothing happens. I was thinking maybe I had to mess with the ruler on top? But I was doing that and it was just messing up all the words. Please help me, getting very frustrated =P

Alright, I bought a Flip Video Camera about 1 month ago and I've used windows movie maker quite a bit in the past on my old windows xp. Ever since I got my flip I've been having problems-   1. It won't read my camera (Flip Video)   2. When I try to publish a movie it says I have too much space taken up on 1 folder but when I clear it it still won't work.   3. Whenever I try to do something with the audio it will close out.   4. Sometimes it will randomly close out.   5. It won't play the movie when I want it to play   6. When I open something it won't play.   Well... you get the picture. So if any of you has experienced any of these problems or know anything please respond.

I tried everything i know t block the ads.      For internet explorer 7, I went to the tools menu and went to pop-up blocking settings and set it to blocking every single ad.   But then, it still doesn't block the advertisements. Instead, it only blocks the necessary pop-ups, like videos and hyperlinks.      Then, I tried downloading free pop-up blockers like Pop-up Stopper from Panicware. However, it still doesn't block the advertisements.      I also tried downloading the 30-day trial of Bitdefender Total Security 2009. I ran a deep system scan and i found about 130 viruses. I deleted all the viruses. However, it still doesn't stop the pop-up ads. So, I just deleted the program.      I could just close the ads that pop up but the process that the ad invades the computer slows the computer down drastically.      I really need some help. Is this a work of a virus? Is there a way to prevent pop-up ads?

After the power came back on, I had no internet connection. I tried all day to get through to Bellsouth. I kept getting a recorded message telling me that they were experiencing system maintenance problems. I was finally able to get through. They were able to get me connected by bypassing my Linksys WRT54G wireless router because I couldn't get a connection through the router. They told me that in order to resolve any router issues, I had to contact Linksys. I contacted Linksys (An Indian guy that I could barely understand). He told me that my router was off warranty and I would have to pay before they would talk to me. I was wondering if there was anyone out there who could help me. The problem is most likely a simple solution and I didn't want to pay almost what the router cost me to begin with, for a simple solution.  Thanks!

20090307131128AAqX1yv	Computers & Internet;Security	ARP Posioning with Cain & Abel and Ettercap?	Hi!      Right now I'm taking a cyber security class and have ran into some trouble trying to work with Cain & Abel and Ettercap as have several other people in the class. The primary issue is that I'm unable to sniff a specific computer that is connected by wire to the router. Cain & Abel sees it when i tell it to look for hosts but once i try to ARP posion it, it just slows down the internet connection to the computer that it basically just becomes a denial of service attack so that doesn't do much good. I'm learning about all these tools on my own home network so I can access my "victim" computer and check to see what's going on so please let me of any suggestions. The other issue, regarding ettercap (Windows version) is that I'll set the netmask to 255.255.255.0 yet it does not find any hosts when i scan for hosts... it also mentions something about an unconfigured file in the text area (I've been unable to find the file in order to configure it)... thus I'm rather confused.      I'm pretty new to most of this stuff so I appreciate any info you can offer. Thanks!

20090307172329AAjdKXv	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	I can't access my Drive C, D and E. What should I do?	When I try to open it, it would say: CHOOSE THE PROGRAM YOU WANT TO USE TO OPEN THIS FILE :| (and I was trying to look for Windows Explorer but nah) It did not use to be this way. Well, it used to be for drives D and E. I can't access any file from those drives. :(      Then I think my desktop crashed as well 'cause I can't find any of my desktop documents anymore except for the shortcuts.      Does this mean my computer has crashed? What should I do? Reformat? Will I still retrieve my files? Some were pretty important.         Hope you can help me! :D

When I checked in Sound Options, it says that it is working perfectly, but still don't hear a sound. When I plugged in the headphones, it worked, but when I unplug it, then I can't hear anything. I have uninstalled the speakers and installed it again and still does not work. I have about a month with this problem and haven't solved it yet. Any suggestions on what can I do because I really need my speakers to work. Thanks if you can help me!

20090307173456AAWkupj	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	What laptops would be good for a student with basic computing needs?	I am looking for a decent laptop for basic school use and later office use.      I would only need the laptop for basic programs such as Internet browsing, MS Word/Excel/Powerpoint, and basic video games (if any).      The only issue is that I am a user of Google SketchUp and would want a computer capable of handling this program. This would likely be the most intensive program I would use.      I came across this computer online and it seems decent for my needs:       http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...       But again I want to ensure that something like this could handle SketchUp without a problem. I had a 5-year old eMachines PC that could handle SketchUp (albeit slowly) without too much of a problem, so I figure that a new laptop could handle it better than the PC could.      Here are the requirements for SketchUp (look under Vista):       http://www.google.com/support/sketchup/b...
