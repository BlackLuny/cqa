wWkfASTNaa	Pregnancy test accuracy is based more on when ovulation and implantation occur, not necessarily when your period is due. If the time you think you conceived was two weeks ago, that would mean you would have had to have ovulated then, implantation would take at least 6 days. I would say now would be a good time to test, it is hard to say if you dont know when you were ovulating. BUt the only way to know is to test. Go to the dollar store and pick a test up, if it is neg, wait a week and test again if you still dont get your period.|`|4PgkqTfzaa	i would wait another week just so u don't get disappointed i was 2 WEEKS LATE and i done numerous tests and all said no and i came on my period and trust me its not something u wanna go through its depressing if u want a baby so much  good luck and i hope u get the result u want.   baby dust for us both|`|bSZK2tVtaa	Go buy a test right now!  Then when you wake up in the morning take it don't take it tonight take it when you wake up in the morning!    Good luck darling|`|WjxqhZG9aa	If you're already late, then you should test.  Most tests can detect before a period is missed.
uKpi4I5Oaa	Maybe ask another doctor, some doctors now a lot and some don't....regardless of their degree.|`|KylTfJpZaa	I'm?pretty???sure???that's ???****???.|`|gWzrZgO2aa	Maybe you have some prairie-dogging crap. haha.|`|wmNPqKK0aa	ur period it can be that colour!
CpJnhy1saa	It's bestamor and bestafar. My kid's grandparents have coffee cups with this printed on them.|`|qq5nceCXaa	The more traditional way of saying it is   mormor - mothers mother  morfar - mothers father,   farmor - fathers mother   farfar - fathers father  and a 2005 survey put this as the top usage amongst norwegian children, with bestemor/bestefar in second place.    I like the identification of the specific grandparent and it's very similar to some scots usage of Mother's mother and Mothers faither and so on.    Of course the grandparents also refer to their grandchildren as barnebarn.|`|48RjJrxnaa	I think grandma is Bestamor and grandpa is Opa|`|sODHwf1Maa	Collective term is besteforeldre (bestefar and bestemor). Some also say farfar/farmor (father's father, father's mother, literally), and morfar/mormor (mother's father, mother's mother, literally).

vue9NOhYaa	The eyedrops are routine. They are harmless and the mother may not know that she is infected.<br>  <br>  If you feel strongly about baby NOT getting them, check the laws in your state. You may be able to request that baby not get them.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Silver nitrate isn't used anymore, because it is irritating. Antibiotic ointment is now used, and they always wait until after mom and baby have had time together.  Those who say that it wasn't given to their babies-- you probably weren't aware, since it would have been done when baby was examined, weighed, measured, cleaned up and so on.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think it is if the mother has it because I don't recall my baby getting any.|`|AA10186411	What kind of drops?  You mean the eye stuff?  Its silver nitrate, and most hospitals give it to all babies.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  After reading other answers, apparently the hospital I gave birth to my daughter at and used to work at, does it to all babies lol Well, probably every hospital in this state, being as every child I've been to see after they were born had it.  I obviously never had gonorrhea lol|`|52bAHCaUaa	I would think it would be based on whether the mother has it. My daughter didn't receive them, and I don't have Gonorrhea.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~<br>  Perhaps it was given to my baby...although I'm not sure if the same rule applies to a 2lb preemie baby as a full term baby. If its not harmful, which I can't imagine it is, I wouldn't mind them giving it to my baby!|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I live in Utah and it's a law here that they have to give it. (According to my birthing class instructor) I did ask the hospital to delay putting it in so I could look into my baby's eyes when he first got here for a bit. (It's like a greasy ointment)|`|AA11981363	I think only if the mother has it, since my daughter never got anything like that, but i don't live in the states so i wouldn't know for sure.<br>  <br>  weird question! :p|`|g4mvfBQ8aa	At the hospital I work at, we give all babies vitamin k shot and erythromycin ointment in the eyes within the first hour.  The shot helps to start blood clotting factors in baby and the ointment is for STDs that maybe were undetected and prevents blindness.  In my state of NC, the ointment for the eyes are state law.  It is very rare that parents request not to receive the medications.  It does occur but usually for some invalid reason the parents have.  It is healthy for the babies and they do well with it.  So for your question, it may vary state to state what is required but as a nurse I would give it to my own child.|`|c73QkZ2haa	What drops? Like eye drops? I didnt know that was for gonorhea....<br>  <br>  Mine never got any eye drops my oldest or my 2 most recent.<br>  <br>  <br>  Silver Nitrate or Antibiotic Eye Ointment<br>  To prevent the chance of blindness due to gonorrhea from an infected mother, hospital-born babies are given silver nitrate or other antibiotic drops in their eyes, even if the mother previously screened negative for this or other STDs in her pregnancy.  Silver nitrate causes pain, burning, swelling and blurred vision for the first days of life and in the vast majority of cases, is not needed when the mother is known to be free from infection.<br>  <br>  Seems that its a law in the states but you have the right to refuse it. Im in canada thats probably why mine didnt get it.|`|JgZwvXXJaa	No they run test during labor for STD'S that is why they take blood and what not they would not give unecessary meds but every hospital may be different|`|yea2hci5aa	I assume it's because the mother has it because my daughter never got treated for it.  She's now 12 months old.
prqrQcd1aa	I have a 1998 Chevy Malibu and can fit 3 in there just fine!|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	My sister has a ford focus and she can easily fit a 4 year old, 2 year old and baby in the back of it. It just depends on what car seats you have. She had spent a lot of money on a larger seat for her son so it didn't work as well. But you can get perfectly safe seats that all fit together in the back. Or you could always get a minivan. What happens when you have other kids coming somewhere with you (relatives, neighbors, etc.) Do you have pets? I drive a minivan as a young adult with no kids because I need a larger car for work, babysitting and it's nice to have a seperate area (in the trunk) that is designated for my dog. Plus it has good gas mileage. I don't think I'll ever be able to have a smaller car now that I'm used to a minivan. But you can easily fit three kids in the back of a regular four door car.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	My sister has 3 kids and she has a trailblazer. She can fit all three car seats in it.    I have a ford excursion and can fit three car seats in the first row of seats and than another in the back row(if we have my god daughter with us). My husband has a f-150 and he can fit the three car seats in his truck as well.     My suggestion for you is whatever vechile you get make sure that you get one with three shoulder belts in the backseat. Since once your kids are in booster seats they require a shoulder strap.    Good luck
ke2SGcZDaa	It's very normal and the farther along you get, the more there will be. I am in my 9th month and lost my mucus plug about 3 weeks ago. Now that's no fun. Buy long and thin pantiliners because you will be changing them often. Trust me. As long as it doesn't have a foul odor or itchy feel, you should be fine. Every visit you have with the doctor, they do a urinalysis and they catch infections or anything abnormal. Hope that helps. Good luck hun!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Totally normal!|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Yeah Im 6 weeks pregnant and I seem to be producing more vaginal discharge. I don't know why but I read that its ok.|`|mCDopsLEaa	yes this is normal. be concerned if it has an odor.|`|GZrR0uxjaa	yeah, being pregnant makes you produce more of this discharge, its normal, unless its fowl smelling or discolored, then that could mean an infection...buy some of those pantyliner things...they seem to help me feel somewhat dry...good luck!|`|e82a823b890a1b465c57df534fd4f153aa	Yes, it is fine.  You should worry though if there is an odor or changes from a clear or white color.  It may be thin or thick.  I even though I was leaking fluid during my last pregnancy because it was so thin.  No need to worry though.

e49178f67a815a64799d8c1237b9affaaa	Your bedtime routine is spot on.  You say bed 'if asleep'.  It should be bed whether asleep or not as 7pm is just the right time for a baby to go to sleep if they are up at 7am.    Controlled crying should work okay - your baby is old enough.  I would not leave him for more than 5 mins at a time before going in and comforting him - don't take him out of the room though.    He should have a dream feed around 10.30 pm for a little while till he gets used to not feeding so often.  You could cut this out once he learns to sleep a bit better as at his age he shouldn't really need a feed at this time.     However, being breastfed it's not as if you can say he got 6 oz so at least you could be reassured by a dream feed that you're not starving him!    Anyway that should do him right through till 7am ish.  By the way if he wakes before that eg 5 am/6am you should do the controlled crying again.  Offer some cooled boiled water and then keep going in every 5 - 10 mins until 7am.    Black out roller blinds or curtains help stop early morning waking (I take it he has something to cuddle like a teddy for comfort?)|`|476Ysdfaaa	no crying system please...things will get better....(slowly though!)|`|SkCnQHceaa	Eh, I dont think crying it out would be such a good idea this early, but it does work for some moms. I have only let my son cry it out a few times and its been recently and he is almost 16 months. He is also breastfed. Still is. lol We havent gotten to weaning yet because we are moving and dont want to add more stress for him. Is your little one eating any solids yet? If he is only eating solids once a day, try twice. Or if they are eating solids twice, try 3 meals. Maybe try to keep one of the solid feedings fairly close to bedtime that way it stays with him/her throughout the night. Top him off with milk just before bed. That way he/she should have no issues sleeping 5 hours straight before getting back up. Also, are you cosleeping? Because that seems to make it easier for the baby to wake up since his food source is right next to him already. ya know? Sleeping in his or her own bed would help too if you arent already doing that. HTH! Good luck!|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	just remember that at this age he does NOT need to feed 3-4 times a night! its habit not hunger. its ok to let him cry for some of those awake times. but you will have to steel yourself not to get up.i learned this the hard way-turns out they wont stop getting up in the middle of the night all by themselves. anyway at 7 months your son shouldnt need to eat every 2 hrs at night. once he realizes he isnt going to eat in the middle of the night, if he does need the food, he will eat more at his last feeding in the evening. good luck! remember the reason you are doing it- sleeeep!! for all of you!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Well I'd cut out the 5:30 TEA. Tea has caffeine in it. That doesn't really help the sleeping part at all.|`|FLpMShKNaa	I went thru this-I heard people say that a baby would just sleep thru the night on their own but studies do not back this up. I recommend the healthy sleep habits, healthy child book-its a bit wordy and condescending but there is some good wisdom in there. I felt like crap letting my son cry, but I had to because at 7 months I could no longer function, I'd forget where I was going in the car, or how to get him in a car seat. Our guilt went away when we realized our son was SO much happier and playful once he had a schedule. I believe that helping a child have a predictable sleep pattern and get the sleep they need helps them feel more, not less secure. Plus, studies show kids who learn good sleep habits are more secure, and their moms have less depression. Good Luck!|`|kzyEuRroaa	I agree with another poster- try "the No Cry Sleep Solution" by Elizabeth Pantley, excellent book, and very loving methods.  I am currently reading the No Cry Discipline Solution, and am impressed by it (brushing up on Pantley, because my mom's group is lucky enough to have a web chat with her in March)  Cry it out is hard to do, I tried it with my first as I was young and exhausted.  It's amazing how my parenting has changed over time and with each child.  Cry it out takes patience and lots of time.  It's hard to hear your baby cry for nights on end.  Good luck!!|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	Ok first up, I just thought I should clear up the 'tea' confusion, by tea she means evening meal (it's a british thing).    It sounds to me like your son has gotten into a habit, at his age he shouldn't be feeding so much during the night, especially when you say he is fully weaned (I'm assuming by that you mean he is on 3 meals a day?). Try introducing a 4th meal at bedtime, cereal/baby porridge etc, then 1 last feed before settling to bed. Feed at 11 if he wakes for it and the rest of the time just settle him back to sleep. I see no harm in leaving him to cry for 5/10 min bursts, I did, and still do, the same with my son who is just over 2 now and he's no worse for it. As I said it does seem to me more like a habit/comfort thing for him rather than hunger. It will be tough at first, but perseverance will pay off. Good luck.|`|qdLdcR8Maa	Move the routin down slightly so,,,,,,    try giving him his TEA at 7pm  Then play till 8pm  bath at 9pm   feed after bath  so bed at 10pm say.    Maybe giving him baby rice or porridge bcus they are filling fr along time.  if he wont take a bottle is he not drinking juice or water?     I have a night light in my sons room and the radio on bcus he wont sleep with out a little bit of noise i guess he doesnt feel alone then!|`|awRNr2VMaa	did you say tea? like as in the drink? i wouldnt wanna sleep either if i was a baby! that has a lot of sugar and caffiene in it for a baby. you shouldnt still be feeding him throughout the night. youre not going to get any results from CIO if hes still feeding as much at night. i would start to ween him at night. lay him in his bed on his belly and pat his back to sleep instead of feeding him.|`|sciO32Bsaa	You should try giving him some rice cereal, just a couple tablespoons to begin with.  I know docs now tell you that they don't need food until after 12 mo but if he is eating every two hours at 7 mo then he needs it!  His poor belly isn't getting full.  Also tea is not for babies!|`|fy69hAeQaa	Try giving him some rice cereal before bed. That might help him sleep longer. Also if he won't take a bottle, try getting him to drink from a sippy cup. They have transition cups out there that work great.    When he wakes up at might, don't talk to him, don't coo at him,. just feed him and put him back to bed. Also, don't turn the lights on. This should let him know it is still time to sleep. HTH|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	I do not recommend letting any baby CIO to get them to sleep longer. It does not teach a child to fall asleep, they finally give up after realizing mommy is not coming to get me and fall asleep from exaustion.  It is also been found that mass amounts of cortisol are released in the brain when a baby cries for an extended amount of time and can stunt mental growth.    Your baby is waking to eat and letting him just cry when he wakes is him crying in hunger.  That said I can sympathizes with your situation as my daughter wakes just as frequently, if not more, and is also breastfed.  My only suggestion is to always try to rock back to sleep before automatically nursing - baby will let you know if he really needs the feed or he'll just fall asleep.  Full night time weaning is not recommended before one year.      I am going to look into Pantley's book: No cry sleep solution.  She was a mom who had a baby with a wake every hour and nurse type of habit.  She wrote a book about what worked for her and I have heard from other mothers it helped their baby sleep longer stretches.  Please note your baby may continue to nurse at least once a night well past 1 year old and that is very normal!    Good luck, please don't use CIO!    EDIT:  LOL, she is not having the kid drink "tea"!  Tea is what some people call dinner or supper.....|`|PbBWJGsTaa	Don't worry - at least one of us knows what you mean by "tea".  I'm guessing they don't use that word in the US.    Mines 9 months old, Breastfed and on 3 solid meals a day.  Shes been on 3 meals a day from around 7 months, but only for the past few weeks has she slept through the night without a feed.  Before that she was nursing 2-3 times overnight.  She also has never taken a dummy or a bottle.      I didn't try the crying thing on purpose, it happened after i spent 6 hours from 8pm till 2am rocking her and nursing her as she screamed every time i put her back down.  I wound up sobbing on the staircase (was already very sleep deprived leading up to that night). She stopped screaming after around 5 minutes.  I felt terrible after that as i never wanted to eave her crying on her own.  The next night though, she woke for her first feed, i tried to give it to her and she pushed me away.  So i rocked her and put her back down.  After that, she stopped waking for feeds.    Thats just my experience, i'm not suggesting you should leave your baby to cry.  Personally i think some developmental switch flipped in her brain that night.      I'm guessing you co-sleep with a nursing pattern like that.  In which case, it seems like a typical pattern to me.  The nursing is definitely a neurological and not a physical need overnight at this age, so you probably just have to wait for him to grow out of it.  Sleep patterns change so dramatically in the first year.|`|Z7q4Q8Yxaa	well i would give him a bath at 7:00 and then a feed. could u not give him a bigger feed by trying him on the other breast so he may sleep longer?|`|vrwFgpNKaa	he is using you breast a a dummy for comfort. a baby shouldn't be breast fed any sooner than 3 to 4 hours my health nurse told me. i have had my daughter in a routine since day 1 she slept thru 9pm 8am every day she is now 4 months. you need to speak with your doc or health nurse before you go crazy!
b3CwObBdaa	I haven't heard anything about hair or eyecolour, but as for ssex selecting - even that's not 100% yet.  I think that I read at my docs office that it cost close to $3000.  Although, I didn't really pay much attention.|`|bnQ7im8Caa	i dont know. but im sure its probably alot.|`|sLERr3aAaa	I'm sure it is very expensive. Cheaper the old fashioned way|`|4p9sBdyTaa	How much does it cost to play God?? I have heard it is priceless.|`|L0873cdDaa	Kids are not clothes, you shouldn't just get whats fashionable. Thats dumb.
AA11185897	Maybe.   If you are young you may not be regular.   Take a test. If you cant afford it, go to your local pregnancy center. They have Free tests and don't share your information with anyone if that is a concern for you.    Note to the above comment, IT IS VERY POSSIBLE TO GET PREGNANT EVEN IF YOU USE PROTECTION DURING SEX.    If there is any signs or concerns about possible pregnancy You really need to find out and get prenatal care if you are. Babies deserve the best, even if they weren't planned.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	No it doesn't. Can't you just get a test and see?|`|1WRB7RPNaa	no, only if you had unprotected sex and you take a pregnancy test and the results say positive|`|5OsSGCdAaa	take a test...|`|d6dzoHvvaa	Could be, have you taken a test yet? I would take a test to make sure and then go to the doctor.|`|AA12164862	either call and make an appt with an Obstetrican or go to the Pharmacy and buy a pregnancy test.  Then you will know.|`|E9F6qjRWaa	just take a test and if it negative then go to a doc|`|FCEWa7zraa	it could be. or you're stressed. there are many reasons. take a test.|`|P6WvViFjaa	There are SEVERAL reasons why you could be going so long without a period. Obviously, pregnancy is the number one thing most women assume, but it could be stress, some form of illness, or your just simply not having your period haha   Take a pregnancy test, and if it's negative, go to the doctor.|`|YH46aQCtaa	It depends on your age and if you had unprotectedsex or not!|`|6a0cd0391065cc81ea4518dae3754040aa	It could, and that's certainly likely if you're sexually active, but periods can skip for lots of reasons. Stress, dramatic weight loss or weight gain, changing forms of birth control, illness or infection.     You should get tested right away, and proceed from there. If you're not pregnant, then make an appointment with a gynecologist and find out what's up.    Good luck!|`|bIuPngqIaa	you should take a pregnancy test. if you are scared have a friend go with you and be your support system|`|dbyLDPwmaa	Well not really, i had missed my period and was without it for 3 months but im irregular so yea i dont have track of it so u might be irregular but idk have u seen changes on your body???
bx6OKLIbaa	I had irregular cycle and treated by fertility drug clomid and metformin.  I have one kid and with 2nd i got w/o drugs. My dr everyday sex is not good if u r trying to get preg b/c sperm count is low. try every other day. first track ur ovulation time to use ovulation strips.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It wasn't hard for me to get pregnant at all.  I was on birth control for 10 years and on the 3rd month after stopping I got pregnant.  I pretty much focused on the whole week after my cycle ended.  It did become a little complicated using last period to predict the due date...that was off 11 days after the 1st ultrasound...8 after the 2nd ultrasound.|`|pwj7dnSLaa	You need to go see your GP who will refer you to see a gynaecologist,  I had the same problem as your self, after investigation's and prodded about etc, got told i have polycystic ovary disease,But although can still take a long time it is hard to get pregnant with this with out help. your dr may give you some clomoide to help you, i after many Years went on to have two beautiful boys, although 17 years gap between the two.    I wish you luck..|`|cb510696d0a5c4f47838f85e424ce421aa	I have pcos, and very irregular periods. It was very hard for me to pin-point my ovulation days, and it took us over 3 years to get pregnant with our first child. She passed away in 2007 and we had to wait to start trying again, but the first month off birth control and I got pregnant. My best advice is to be patient. It will happen when the time is right. Best of luck.|`|qH6ecSa3aa	I've been irregular since I was 12 years old. At one point I didn't have a period for 9 months! Then I got it for 3weeks straight. I then skipped 6months. I went to 3 different OB's and none of them found anything wrong so the last one I went to gave me a pill to start my period and then started me on birth control (FemCon) to regulate. I stopped taking the birth control after three months and I've been regular ever since. With the exception that I'm now 21weeks pregnant lol. What I'm trying to say is, if you're having a hard time conceiving maybe you should go on the pill for a couple months just to help you regulate so that way it will be easier to pinpoint your ovulation date. If you don't want to do that (and i could understand not wanting to be on birth control while you're trying to conceive lol) you could always buy a ton of ovulation tests! :o) Good luck to you!!! I send you lot's of baby dust!
a7b81aec51d8df49e523d067b9b07ea9aa	it sounds like you are. go to the doctors or at least take a pregnancy test. if all that stuff is happening you must be pretty far along|`|IjcdwJiMaa	u could be take a test 2 make sure!|`|pwLufnSzaa	Your probably pregnant.

I would go get a test, or find a planned parenthood clinic and go have them give you a urine test.|`|65cBvdqraa	take a test.    you cant ALWAYS tell by your period  it could be late just cause you're stressed out.      take a test to be positive.    haha get it? positive?!  ...sorry.|`|ycy0y5Qqaa	we need to know when your last period was|`|ETTEaxVeaa	Could well be-do a test!!!|`|17MZkNpZaa	you either need to purchase a home pregnancy test or go talk with your obgyn about your symptoms
cU7webVgaa	No, but I did take into account the comments people made on the names I was considering. I asked for some suggestions but ended up picking names my boyfriend and I had already thought of before asking.

RMJ5OtO1aa	It doesn't mean a thing.  Dreams are just random strings of memories thrown up by the mind when you are asleep and most acceptable to the unconscious part of your brain.    I wouldn't even think about it again, this boy is just a random figure presented to you by your subconscious.    Don't let anyone tell you that you are destined for each other or that you must have feelings for him if you know you don't. This will only cause paranoia. =D|`|REC4YgOuaa	yeah your having a wet dream|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Perfectly natural to have that kind of dream.  Dreams don't mean anything.|`|EsaFg8eaaa	It was your hormones wanting you to bang him. Its normal, just dont act on it, and if you do wear a condom!|`|yuF2K1rLaa	It means you want to have sex with him.  Heres a video on how to overcome this dream however.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRH...|`|4e1nRQCUaa	be open to new connections|`|UQLHTT7Faa	dont worry about it im in  alot of girls dreams having sex with them...|`|TPn3CEK0aa	Congradulations, youve just had your first wet dream.|`|Yy5SRxBJaa	i would feel creepy  if i answered this question|`|XoYHF1RLaa	No. There is a guy named Huge Penis here. He is a pervert.|`|Tf0WM1WMaa	nope. except it can be a subconscious thought. like maybe u secretly want to hook up with him?|`|0PVp8Okoaa	hormones! what else is there to say? lol!|`|MIUzgwsTaa	OMG.!  That happened to you TOO...    What I did was ignored it but I know I had to be thinking of it before i went to sleep|`|LbNXxRXnaa	I have had dreams like that before|`|kM9xoajHaa	I had those dreams all the time, and because your body is thinking about that guy and you should talk to him more often|`|wqrZomw4aa	that means you were thinking about having sex whith him whe you went to sleep... because that is basically how dreams happen|`|uA3yUdCzaa	nope|`|iYdTFoNWaa	Teenagers have these dreams a lot, especially boys, but it's common in girls too.|`|pYpXj7gOaa	haha many teenage girls have sex dreams but its not usual for a girl to own up to it! good for you!!  a dream may mean a variaty of things, but its usually just the mind wondering off(which can also have meaning)|`|DPegPYRPaa	Is it normal? Probably. Everybody gets sexual dreams. And it doesn't mean you want to bang him. Maybe you brain just remembered him from that day.|`|UQLkPdGVaa	umm it might mean you want to have sex with him?  you should as him out or something..|`|qFOdHHCDaa	No probably not, we all have weird dreams sometimes, its normal (:|`|nJezM2aMaa	nope. it means you want a puppy|`|gfiTCFTeaa	hmm.  maybe you'll have desha-vu sooner or later. . . hah.|`|GA5izZqGaa	Nah girl, personally I don't believe in Freud's "latent content" theory. I once had a dream I was in the restroom on the toilet when some guy I spoke to once or twice and had zero interest in slammed open the stall door and I ended up making out with him.    I really doubt that dream meant anything, but who knows, you and I might be different.    So either we're both crazy, or dreams are just really random.|`|jtlcYqutaa	ur just horny its called puberty grow up whore|`|TJKij7gvaa	no it isn't... you're at the age where stuff like thta starts happening... don't worry|`|soUND2xEaa	well its not a wet dream cause nothing is wet(if you know what i mean) you just want to bang the kid thats all.If you want talk to him more introduce yourselves and ask him out and see how things workout|`|b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	I used to dream about sex most nights when I was 15.  I daydreamed about sex most of the day too.  Sometimes in the dreams I was with someone I didn't even find attractive.  It didn't mean that I necessarily wanted that particular person, just that my mind was on sex so much at that age, that even when I went to sleep I was still thinking about it, therefore dreamed about it.  Sounds like a typical dream to me.|`|8v40KEd0aa	No, not unusual at all.|`|XtbjzpK7aa	it's normal. you have a bunch of hormones.|`|0X9x5YrOaa	no just a random fantasy.|`|r1MImdh3aa	No. Sometimes dreams like this are just dreams. Just because you dream about it does not mean you should act upon it in real life.|`|86UVdNqaaa	unusual? so very normal..|`|QzyUTwq8aa	its just a dream  dont look too much into it!!|`|phCPWyBTaa	grow|`|d5onKaO6aa	tahts perfectly normal!|`|AA11435910	It does not mean anything and is normal. Do not let it make you treat this boy differently.|`|FzrH4I8naa	basic teenage hormones.|`|Xf3ixVWTaa	It means you're pregnant.|`|CJZZavCwaa	depends...is it my brother your dreaming about?  if so, there might be a problem...|`|brzaR6f9aa	naw, dreams like that at that age are nothing. just things you have stuck in the back of your head. at 15, i think all girls dream about that...|`|2k6lvvfJaa	check out this site,its like all girls talking bout goin thru this stuff very helpful to me  http://cbize.net/upload/document/pa%20Ch...|`|SHXvUSd4aa	It is completely normal, it is just you are fantasizing, you are growing up.... You do not have to do anything about it. Enjoy the fantasy, just do not act on it.|`|A8lwcL8Aaa	Ehh.... No. Not really.|`|5cad55284c0036f9d151822f938e2f79aa	Its normal to be curious about sex, dont feel bad about that!! Just waite till you are older before you act on those feelings, dont do anything you might regret.|`|YumnTjVNaa	i doubt it.  its just your hormones.  dont worry about it and dont actually try anything.  all you did is hold hands in your dream,   and you assumed the rest.    its all good, but its not unusual, people always have these dreams whether or not you know it.  (that doesnt mean its a good thing though)  =]|`|kyCvdX3uaa	It could mean ANYTHING!!! We all dream about crazy stuff. Trust me it was just a dream.|`|4OxShnFRaa	It is normal, and nothing to  be ashamed about. It is your hormones going crazy because your developing more, and getting older. You will feel new things that might seem strange, but they're totally normal, just don't act on it.|`|hzB8DMtpaa	It meant one thing your in love with him if hes already with someone but if he isnt ask him out and if he says yes go on a few dates and after a few years and your still together maybe thats the right time|`|E0b6f7Mkaa	well sounds like you have a sexual attraction to him and you must think about sex alot or something...|`|Vsho9I4eaa	Ive had a couple dreams like that to. Some with people I don't even like.  Sometimes it means you like them or it means that's who you saw or hung out with most of the day. Dreams are unpredictable. I personally don't believe they mean anything. If you have the same dream over and over though, I'd maybe try to know him. Hope this helps.|`|xSPDeXGmaa	'Course it's normal. I had the same thing when I was your age. My daughter has it.    So yes, it is normal. Just don't rush into things.  :-)|`|Hs3ihi4faa	No. just means your mind created a fantasy and u more than likely had a wet dream. Possibly your sub-conscious is saying that you like him, but chances are that it's just a random person your mind put in there.|`|MJF7nMbpaa	haha dont worry bowt it hun!!!!!  i had bassicaly the exact same dream a few days ago and i didnt even like the guy! just let it pass    xo|`|UxMugqdraa	1. u like him  2. u wanna have sex  3. a random dream  4. or he likes u and u can tell
G6h7mjdpaa	Here's our routine, our baby is 10 months old.  630a-730a wake up, bottle, then playtime  830a- breakfast   1030a- snack, followed by a bottle (our baby use to have a 2hr nap here)  1230p- lunchtime  130p- bottle followed with at least a 2hr nap  330p- snack  530p-Suppertime followed with a small bottle  730p- We start bathtime, storytime, bottle then anywhere inbetween 8p-830p is bedtime.|`|8v40KEd0aa	Your always going to be changing your routine every once in a while. That's just how it is.  Just come up with a new one.|`|cEgI5ogLaa	When my daughter was 6 months she woke up around 8 or 830, had   breakfast around 9.   Snack around 10  2 hr nap around 1030 or 11  lunch following her nap 1230 or 1  snack around 3pm  nap around 4 (usually 20min-1hr depending on the day)  dinner around 530  bath 6 (or after dinner)  snack 7  bed at 8    All of the snacks were either real snacks or bottles (I know the schedule of feedings because it hasn't changed too much since but I don't remember how many bottles ect per day at that time)    All kids routines will change slightly as they get older, my daughters changed a lot when she was about 5 or 6 months old, then again around 9 months old.  Good luck =)  Toni Lynne

J4z3mJyuaa	It's mostly genetics, and usually larger if it's a boy. Eating a high fat diet and/or gaining a lot of weight while pregnant can also cause your baby to be larger. Diabetics tend to have larger babies, as well.<br>  My first baby (girl) was 6lbs. 11 1/2oz. My second baby (boy) was 8lbs. 6oz. My baby boy came out in 2 easy pushes, while it took an hour (maybe a little more) to deliver my daughter. The labor was incredibly painful and he was practically coming out on his own. I am confident that I could've just lain there and he would've still came out, because I had such strong contractions. <br>  I had Pitocin to deliver my daughter after my water broke a couple of weeks early, but my contractions were still very light compared to my second birth. It's probably why she was harder to deliver, despite being smaller. I would suggest not rushing to push too early. It is much easier to push the baby out when he's ready! My doctor came in and checked me and said "Woooah! Get the table!" and he was out in like 60 seconds. lol<br>  Don't be too afraid. Women are designed to spread and deliver their babies. Eight pounds really isn't as large as it sounds. Now 10lbs is a large baby, and women have been delivering them for thousands of years.<br>  I was measuring large with my son at 36 and 38 weeks, and my doctor became concerned that the baby was going to be large. He asked me if my parents or my husband's parents had large babies, and said that usually meant that their children will too. I had an ultrasound at 38 weeks that estimated that my child was already 8 lbs. I decided against the c-section and he was born at 41 weeks at 8lbs 6oz. You should realize that the ultrasound can be off by up to 2 lbs, and is often inaccurate. Your doctor should be measuring your belly at the later stages of pregnancy and will let you know if you're measuring large, so that you can ask for an ultrasound to make sure your baby isn't getting too big.<br>  Oh, and I tore a little bit both times and had to have an episiotomy. These are very common and can happen even with a small baby, as in my case. The cut was the same size both times, and my doctors did it as soon as I started tearing to prevent further damage. It was sore, but rinsing with warm water and spraying it with Dermoplast every time I went to the bathroom kept it manageable. I highly recommend using it, because you can't take prescription pain meds if you're going to breastfeed. It might help if you don't tear, as well. It has a numbing agent in it and is cool and soothing. You have to use it every hour or two, or the pain will come back. You'll be fine, don't worry! I just cleaned and sprayed, and didn't even take Tylenol for more than 3 days.|`|333e3165a0426e11bbd47089d6ab94a6aa	well i was 6lb 13 and my partner was 9lbs 4 and our daughter was 10lb 4! you 'refuse' to give birth vaginally if your baby is over 8lbs? come on... the average is 7.7lbs so its quite likely that yours will be around that size.  just be glad for a healthy baby and think of us poor women who gave birth to huge babies!! i did it naturally with only gas and air (entonox) and i am terrible with pain, i am such a wuss usually so if i can do that, you can do it too (and its quite likely yours wont be over 10lbs) <br>  also i did eat a lot of cr*p when i was pregnant as thats what i caved so maybe that had something to do with it so id definitly say try to eat a healthy balanced diet (although dont diet or deprive yourself af anything)<br>  <br>  Good luck and can i just say from friends experience dealing with the aftermath of a c-section can be a lot more painful than givin birth vaginally to a big baby|`|tmh42R6Caa	I would say it's mostly genetic.  I was 8lb 15oz and my husband was 9lb 15oz.  My baby was 9lb 2oz.  We were big babies and we're tall adults.  I kind of expected it.  What you eat should not affect it at all.  And definitely don't go on a diet to prevent a big baby.  Pregnant women need to eat A LOT to feed themselves and their growing baby.  Your doctor will monitor the size of your baby.  When he/she feels the baby is getting too big, he/she may induce to make it easier to deliver.  Don't worry.  There's nothing you can do at this point to change the size of the baby.|`|yCwPxulYaa	It is mostly genetics (or gestational diabetes, health issues etc.)<br>  <br>  But my baby was 6 lbs 4 oz but had the head of a 9 lb baby or bigger  (her head was off the charts as far as percentile) because my husband had a big head.  <br>  <br>  You dont want a c-section.  It is major surgery.  I would rather birth out a 15 lb baby then have a c-section.  C-section mommas would probably agree.<br>  <br>  So even if you have a small baby.....you can still have issues!|`|h85kkDsbaa	Both me and my husband were small babies like about 6lb and i ate pretty much normal or even a bit less while pregnant and i had a huge baby weighing 9lb 11 1/2ozs. I had a vaginal delivery and its really not that bad, at the end of the day if you have nothing to compare it too how will you know if its worse.<br>  <br>  Good luck X|`|wCRC0poAaa	i think it has more to do with the daddys birth weight.<br>  ive had a 6lb13oz, a 9lb4oz and twins 7lb2oz and 7lbs4oz.<br>  im not a big eater and really dont know how i managed to produce a baby more than 6lbs!!<br>  by the way, i found giving birth to the 9pounder easier than the 7pounder - no stitches or episiotomy.<br>  and please dont be thinking of a c section, recovery is horrendous. im still not right almost a year later.|`|3fYRi1y4aa	My first son was 7lbs 12oz and my second was 7lbs 2oz.  Labor is painfull BUT you will make it thru.  Your body is made for it.  I gave birth to both of them vaginaly and I honestly feel like it was a bonding experience between my self and my husband.  Him helping me thru the contractions holding my hand and being so patient made me fall more in love with him.  If you have a good support system labor can be a wonderful experience minus the pain!  I have never had a Csection but Im sure the pain afterwords from being cut open is way worse because it lasts weeks.  Just worry about keeping yourself healthy for right now.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Why? Your body is designed to give birth. My daughter was 8lbs10oz vaginal and everything was fine. Dont worry about it when it comes right down to it your body does things to get ready. Your pelvis loosens up to make way for the baby. Youll be fine even if their over 8 lbs.<br>  I was 1lb8oz(3months prem)<br>  My husb was 12lbs6oz<br>  Our daughter was 8lbs10oz<br>  Our twins were 6lbs14oz and 6lbs4oz....I had almost 14 pounds of baby...and i wish i could have went natural on this one.<br>  C-Section is not fun. If you can go natural do it.|`|lphGS59Jaa	My uncle was 11 pounds and 10 ounces, & 23 inches. my grandmother is 5 foot 6 inches & my grandfather was 4 foot 10 inches.  My grandmother had a vaginal birth & had 2 other kids after him.  They were both over 8 pounds.  I have had 4 vaginal births with no meds, I am allergic to everything they can give a pregnant woman.  Its really not that bad, & with a c-section it takes longer to recuperate from the delivery.|`|uySWTCPMaa	I have been told it has alot to do with how big the mother was at birth...I was a twin and was 4pounds, so am unsure how big my baby will be. I am currently 22weeks and not very big. My partner was 10.5pounds at birth so hoping our little bub is not to big! I am only tiny so don't have much room in me for a big baby lol<br>  <br>  You're body is designed to give birth, I think you should just trust yourself and you're body. Having a child is a natural part of life.|`|yea2hci5aa	It's genes.  You have to take the average size of you and your hubby's weight at birth.  <br>  <br>  Fingers crossed that it's not an 8lb baby!   lol<br>  <br>  FYI My daughter was only 6lb 15 ounces and they still had to use forceps to get her out|`|vDz39q7faa	i was around 8lb and my bf was like 6lb and our son was 6.4 so he took daddys side in that department but you can have a bad birth wateva the size of your baby i still had a 3rd degree tear and he was tiny! but im sure you will be just fine dont worry|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	Honestly I dont know if its genetic.  I was 7lbs 12oz and my fiance was 7lbs 9oz at birth.  Our son came out at 9lbs even.  And guess what? It was easier than I could ever have imagined.  I think you're underestimating yourself.  I'm sure you can do it.  I didnt feel a thing when I was pushing him out.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think it is more genes unless you are eating and gaining a ton of weight but it also depends on the size of you when you got pregnant if you are staying within the limit of what your doc said then the baby might be like you were at birth or if you are gaining way more then the doc said then it is possible that your baby will be extremely big I think it all depends. My sister is tiny and had really big babies her girl was 8.11 and boy was 8.1, I don't think you can refuse to have a baby at 8 pounds a lot of them are more then that.|`|wphLaVs6aa	Impending macrosomina is the term that refers to the fear of a large fetus. It's normal to fear it, but a C-section isn't recommended until the baby is bigger than 9.5 pounds. C-sections have much higher risks -- both to mother and child -- than vaginal deliveries and the recovery time is much longer and harder.<br>  <br>  That said, genetics play a large role in the size of a baby. What you eat also contributes to the size of your baby. Eat a balanced diet and drink plenty of water. Get some moderate exercise (walk a mile every day, perhaps?). And try not to worry so much. Be thankful if your baby is a healthy weight!|`|Bw18seFqaa	genetics play some role, I think.   Gestational diabetes can cause a baby to be large too.<br>  <br>  Complications can cause smaller birth weights..  as can smoking, poor diet, drugs, illness, etc.<br>  <br>  I dont think you can "refuse" to deliver vaginally.  A cecarian is not typically done unless the Dr feels there is a medical reason for it.<br>  <br>  I delivered an 8 pd 8 oz baby vaginally with no problems.|`|52bAHCaUaa	First, I'm not sure you can refuse to have a vaginal birth unless something is wrong. I suppose you can try a few doctors and see if one will do a c section. Also, ultrasounds are only estimates of the weight anyway - they can be off by a bit sometimes! <br>  <br>  My husband was 9lbs, I was 5lbs. My daughter was born at 28 weeks and she was 2lbs. So I don't know what she would have been full term, but I suggest vaginal births! C sections are still a MAJOR surgery!|`|NDQS5HJyaa	I think its mostly genetics that play a part in how big or small the baby will be. I don't see how food would play a part in it, really. My daughter was 6lbs 2oz at birth and I was like 6lbs 7oz... my husband was around the same. I've never heard of any stories of babies being huge just because of food. Otherwise most women would be popping out 15lb babies LOL

T7uFoSUQaa	I think they are your kids and you have to love their names. I personally think they are cute. A lot of people will not like the name itself but when they meet your kids they will fall in love with it. I like Chase Kaylor a lot. I know a little girl and her name is Cayler. I think you'd be better off spelling it like that Chase Cayler or Chase Kayler. The "or" is a little masculine for me, but otherwise i like it a lot.|`|rGvlPAMJaa	I like Bella but not Chaela sounds like CHOLA. and Fox Jasper reminds me of the dragging in Jasper. And Chase is ok but I dislike Kaylor (sounds like u couldnt think of name, so u settled for that.|`|TffCSzHxaa	Bella Chaela - Cute, I like it!<br>  Fox Jasper - I didn't know Fox was a name, but it's nice!<br>  Chase Kaylor - How about Kaylor Chase, or Taylor Chase, or Kaylee Chase?|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Bella Kayla is cute<br>  Fox Jasper is a no-NO'<br>  Chase Kaylor- not really ( I know a girl named Chase Taylor)|`|nwi9Fv9Baa	Bella Chaela : Okay in themselves (though I personally would spell it Kayla, even if it was meant solely as a nickname for Michaela).  Bella works best as its own name, as longer names like Gabriella, etc, as just too, well long (imo).  Together though, there is a bit too much rhyming though.  However, Chaela is just a middle name, and the two will rarely even me said together.  Perhaps this name has special meaning to you?  I suppose it can work for the ears after a while.<br>  <br>  Fox Jasper : I suppose Fox is a bit out there.  But its similar enough to Max (a simple but respectable name) and it is also the name of a character in a show that I LOVE (i.e. Fox Mulder) that I can't say much against it.  :)  It is a pretty clever name, like its name sake.  Jasper is a really becoming name when it's on the right person.<br>  <br>  Chase Kaylor : Chase reminds me of someone around my age... someone from the 70s or 80s, living in the age of Jennifers, Nicoles and Ashleys...  though as a boy.  I wrote the first part of the comment with a boy in mind as a matter of fact.  How about Kenna?  Charlotte?  Kaylor also looks a bit odd - I keep wanting to say Taylor...  I hope I don't put you off.  I'm just trying to give some advice and honesty.  Good luck on the new little girl!|`|6YnwXCIaaa	Since your second daughter hasn't been born yet, I'd suggest you name her something other than Chase.  For one thing, your first daughter has a very feminine name and your son's name is quite masculine.  Chase doesn't really fit in well in terms of its being more of a unisex name.  Also, Fox and Chase?  Brings to mind images of British upper class sending out the hounds.|`|edLbogmYaa	Terriable! Those are some crazy names. Especially Fox Jasper.... Jasper is my cat's name... Chaela is OK bc it sounds like Kayla which is pretty but why didn't you just spell it the right way? And Chase Kaylor? Your daughter will be soooo picked on! Why would you do that to your children? Ick!<br>  <br>  Oh and "Bianca" I was thinking about naming my daughter Jasmine..It's a really pretty name!|`|8WbfmK5daa	Bella Chaela - very cute<br>  <br>  Fox Jasper - Jasper is sooooo cute. Not sure about Fox though.<br>  <br>  Chase Kaylor - I like Chase for a boy I think it is too masculine for a girl especially when your other daughter has such  cute name. Kaylor is ok.|`|IOQshyGMaa	Bella: Nooo! Chaela: Interesting...<br>  <br>  Fox: Nope! Jasper: I <3 this name!!<br>  <br>  Chase: Like.. Kaylor: Naah!|`|ommWXJeFaa	chase is ok not kaylor though......the rest are different....i don't really like them but they are unique..its nice to say my kids names are unique (unlike anyone else's).|`|prllht3vaa	Kind of strange, but whatever floats your boat i guess.|`|BCIfeHAqaa	I dont like any of them... sorry. :/|`|KKo4Fctzaa	I think that it shouldn't matter to anyone else what your kid's names are. You choose it and go with your instincts. And if you think that they will get bullied in school, just give them nicknames. In my opinion, they're all great, especially your son, Fox Jasper.|`|KlGHx3z7aa	To be honest, nice names. Strange though. Very different. <br>  In my opinion, <br>  Summer, <br>  Jasmine <br>  Angel.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best name (:|`|tSLApTNYaa	I think fox is a little strange, other children will make fun of him and chase is a boy name, I like Kaylor though.|`|ZvOXs61caa	so cute. i love how creative they are. its nice when you see names that arent used to often. great names . <33|`|VOmE0UFsaa	Im sorry but i dont like any of them*~ but hey if you like it who am i to judge*~|`|05b7c1c1fbc793d554bad3875ddb6118aa	are you kidding me? <br>  those kids are going to be bullied so much.|`|RQL7bo3saa	I like the name Bella, its nice but the others are bizarre|`|c3CVY87caa	I like Bella, I kinda like Chase, but I really really don't like Fox at all... sorry!|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I like Bella not Chaela though.

GWveqx61aa	i dont think there is a question in there, what kind of info you need?are you ttc, than have sex on the 7th  and 5th and 3rd and 8th or have sex every day 24 hours apart from eachother,good luck and baby dust to us all
Kxwyy0Eaaa	Purr, I think it's great that you are still trying to breastfeed for your daughter. The only way I would use formula for a child to whom I gave birth would be if one or both of us had a medical problem that made breastfeeding difficult or impossible.<br>  <br>  Seventeen months and going beautifully. I wanted to go at least a year, but decided to go at least two, or when she decides to stop. For me, NOT breastfeeding was NOT an option. We've had some rough spots, of course, but overall it's been a great experience. These past few days she's been sick and the only food in which she's been really interested in is milk. It makes sense, despite eating a variety of baby and big girl foods, my milk is comforting (she's known it her whole life), we cuddle in the recliner or the sofa in the upstairs TV room and she nurses for as long as she wants. Sometimes, I think she half-nursed, half napped which was fine. (I was able to read several chapters in "The Jungle" which I've been reading since June of last year. I'm actually almost done. Yay!) Also, she can keep my milk down.The last time she was sick (she went through several developmental changes at once and I think it was her body's way of reacting) she puked a couple of times, but would keep down my milk. <br>  <br>  My opinion is that the extra calories go straight to the baby.Yes, I still get hungry more easily and quickly, so I eat (of course), but I think it is from breastfeeding. I weigh about 12 pounds less than what I did when my daughter was conceived. I don't diet. I never have. I eat what I want, when I want and I don't count calories or carbs or anything like that. I eat whole, real foods. Nothing with enriched flour, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, partially hydrogenated oils, hydrogenated oils artificial colors, artificial flavors and anything that looks as though it was created in a lab by humans and not in nature by God. <br>  <br>  For me, the weight loss and any health benefits to me from breastfeeding are just a bonus. I am doing this because I want to give the best to my daughter.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I've been breastfeeding for just about 11 months and I absolutely love it.  I plan to keep going for a while.  You have to be careful about what you eat to get those extra calories each day.  Sure, eating a bowl of ice cream will give you extra calories but they're not going to be easy to burn off.  Eat some extra brown rice or fruits and vegetables and you'll have no problem burning the calories.  Also, exercise is a big thing.  You can't sit around and do nothing and expect to magically drop 15 pounds just because you're breastfeeding.  My suggestion is that you look at your diet.  Adjust the amount of fat and junk foods you're eating.  Increase your fruits and vegetables and complex carbs (necessary for energy). Drink lots of water and begin an exercise program.  Even if it's as simple as walking through your neighborhood pushing the baby in a carriage, that can help you burn calories and begin to lose the weight.|`|308cb6bcf0531e27237a2cb393891091aa	I've been breastfeeding for 6 months now. not exclusively though, coz I have a hormone imbalance and can  not produce enough milk....<br>  <br>  I would like to stop for medical reasons, but my daughter loves it and I don't want to loose the precious time we spend nursing......<br>  <br>  so I don't know how long I will continue nursing....|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I nursed my first for 12 months, my second for 2 years - yes it takes more calories, and with me my appetite went way up too which minimized the calories I was burning nursing.   Actually, it's 500 for a single, 250 only when you're pregnant, 1000 for twins, and I think for my toddler it was about 1,000 calories + for a time too.   Mostly it's a wash, your hunger means you eat as much calories as you need extra to maintain weight for most but in terms of health for you alone (never mind the child's) there is nothing better you can do for yourself for when you are older!   It lowers the incidence of type II diabetes for 15 years for every year you nurse, it lowers the incidence of breast and ovarian cancer and the rate of hip fractures when you are postmenopausal, nursing is money (health) in the bank for moms.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I breastfed for 14 months.<br>  <br>  You don't have to eat those extra calories. If you eat a healthy, normal diet, you will gradually lose weight. (You put on those fat stores during pregnancy specifically to allow your body to make milk.)<br>  <br>  Many women do find that they hang onto a few pounds (typically 5-10) until they wean, but at 5 months post-partum, you still have plenty of time to continue to shed the weight.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I was only able to breastfeed until she was 8 1/2 weeks. I hear it is a lot harder to lose weight when your done breastfeeding, I lost 27 pounds 2 weeks after I had the baby but some people don't.|`|wphLaVs6aa	Breastfeeding helps weight loss. Your body uses fat reserves (that's why you gain weight while pregnant) to produce milk. You burn about 500 calories per day breastfeeding, which would require running about 5 miles per day if you weren't breastfeeding. You should eat until you're satiated and not worry about eating 300-500 extra calories.<br>  <br>  By 6 months, I lost all of the weight I'd gained during pregnancy (38 pounds) and by 9 months, I was 10 pounds below my prepregancy weight. I'm still losing weight, unfortunately. I haven't done anything special to lose the weight -- just ate well, drank lots of water, and chased my baby around. And I walk a lot because I live in a city.<br>  <br>  Losing weight isn't a great reason to quit breastfeeding, but it's a great reason to keep doing it!<br>  <br>  I plan to continue to breastfeed my baby into toddlerhood and will let him wean himself. I've found that it's getting easier and easier as he breastfeeds fewer times during the day and not at all at night. He's almost a year old now and breastfeeding for us is just a great way to reconnect during a busy day, calm him down after a bump or bruise or get him to sleep if he's over tired.|`|DvZdB66maa	I breastfed for almost 5 months. I would have done it longer, but my milk supply started to drop.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I did notice that the weight seemed to drop off more quickly after I stopped breastfeeding, which was weird because I always thought that it would be the opposite... but I lost an extra 10-15 lbs. of weight once I stopped breastfeeding, and now I am back to my pre-pregnancy weight (my baby is 7 months now) without doing anything differently in my routine.|`|iPEv1lRBaa	First child = 6 weeks<br>  Second child = 2 weeks<br>  Third child = almost 9 months now<br>  <br>  I'm actually in the process of weaning, mostly because I work full-time and I'm so sick of lugging this breast pump back and forth to work every day.  I'll have to admit, though, weaning is harding than I thought it would be.|`|4d4bc6d418e7f55703a46a017910893caa	My daughter wouldn't latch but I wanted to breast feed soooo badly! So, I pumped for 4 months (last night was my last time). I found that I could really focus I dieting the few weeks because I was weaning myself of the bf'ing and could lower my calories A LOT! I know... that extra 500 calories sucked! lol<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	It's been 13 months so far.  IDK when that will change.  I held on to the last 15lbs of pregnancy weight until my daughter was about 9 -12 months old.  Now I am still losing weight and am a few lbs. under my pregnancy weight.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I have been breastfeeding for almost 5 months and I do NOT love it. I do plan to stick with it for a year though because I want to do what is best for my baby.|`|h85kkDsbaa	I stopped breastfeeding at 6 weeks and my weight loss was about the same after as it was while breastfeeding.|`|IngripgMaa	I breast fed up until it was time for him to go back to daycare.  So for about 4 months.|`|AA12150541	My first two i breastfed for a year each, and with my baby now it has been almost 6 months and i will continue with her until she turns 1.  Breastfeeding has done wonders for my weight loss with each one.  In fact i am skinnier now after having kids.  You can still diet and exercise while breastfeeding, you just need to eat foods with a lot of nutritional value. Plus the benefits to your child are tremendous.<br>  Good luck!|`|0SHOXqb4aa	I loved it.  I breastfed for 20 months the first time and 22 months the second time.  It was with a little wistfulness that I stopped, but I still felt that the time was right.  <br>  <br>  The first time I lost all extra weight very quickly and went down to being very slim, but started to gain weight after I stopped.  The second time I remained heavier.  I think I was eating about the same and exercising the same amount.|`|yea2hci5aa	You'll automatically drop some extra pounds once you stop breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding burns 500 calories a day so eating 300 to 500 calories extra doesn't make the difference.  Weather permitting go for a walk or run with your baby.  I used to bring my daughter to the gym with me.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|RPBeYbx9aa	I ask the same question. Remarkably, I too have a five month old (born Oct. 4) who i am breastfeeding!!! I absolutely love it and dont kno when i am going to stop, sometime around his first birthday is recommended. some women choose to go longer but 1 yr is minimum.<br>  <br>  as fer as the loosing weight thing, i have been going on walks and doing crunches and my body is responding very quickly. be consistent every day and yhe weight will come off. focuse on the areas you want to shape and visualize the way you want it!|`|z6IekuwSaa	I'm at 4 months...a long 4 months. I do not like it either. I plan to do it until she is a year though. WooHoo to the breastmilk I have stored up though. So far, 380 ounces! So I won't actually have to breastfeed for a year.|`|JgZwvXXJaa	I nursed my first for 13 months and now my second is 4 months still nursing.
QWTLw9DEaa	In general, I think they're nice.<br>  <br>  Sullivan Rhys - 8, I actually quite like this name. But Sully makes me think of Monsters Inc. but I'm sure he could overcome that<br>  <br>  Abram Bennett - 5, not crazy about Abram, but I love Bennett<br>  <br>  Heath Wyatt - 9, I love this. Heath is a great name, and Wyatt is the perfect complement to it<br>  <br>  Wyatt Heath - 5, Heath Wyatt sounds so much better<br>  <br>  Drake Rordan - 3, while everyone loves the name Drake, I hate it so much, it's unexplainable, but mostly for a personal reason. (never mind, it's explained). But I love Rordan<br>  <br>  Drake Henry - 4, again, hate Drake, but I love Henry so much. Henry Rordan would be pretty cool<br>  <br>  Jake Whitney - 6, Jake (Jacob) is my brother's name, and I love it so much, but I hate Jake standing alone. It just feels so alone and empty, it needs to be Jacob. Jacob Whitney would be great<br>  <br>  Cash Sullivan - 4, I hate Cash. End of story<br>  <br>  Abram Cash - 1, dislike both names|`|sGP6s7uraa	Sullivan Rhys "Sully" - very Irish, I like!<br>  Abram Bennett "Bram" - good<br>  Heath Wyatt - I can never get past Wyatt.... or Heath<br>  Wyatt Heath - again...<br>  Drake Rordan - I like Rordan but not Drake<br>  Drake Henry - nope<br>  Jake Whitney - Whitney's been too popularized by girls<br>  Cash Sullivan - good<br>  Abram Cash - eh|`|miFe45quaa	In general, I think they are very classy, yet unique.<br>  I love Drake Henry! How handsome!<br>  Sullivan Rhys is cute, but I think Reese Sullivan sounds better.<br>  I'm not fond of Abram, reminds me of graham crackers (sorry).<br>  <br>  Heath Bennett sounds nice. I don't like Whitney (boy or girl). I also don't like Cash or Rordan. I'm not fond of Jake, but I like Jacob.<br>  <br>  Suggestions:<br>  Jacob Sullivan "Jake"<br>  Jacob Heath "Jake"<br>  Abraham Wyatt "Bram"<br>  Heath Sampson <br>  Jordan Bennett|`|heC9aQ18aa	My favorite would have to be Drake Henry or Wyatt but I am not a fan of the name Heath. To me it is a candy bar or reminds me of Heath Ledher which is a downer. I would change the middle name. I love Wyatt though. Cash is a cool name but not as a proper name. If I was a man, I would like Cash but not on legal documents or important things like a diploma or resume. Cash works full time if you're a rocker but not if you want to work as a manager at the local factory or if you want to be a businee man. Abram and Sullivan are fine names, just not something I would use. As for Jake, I think of it as an abbreviation for Jacob and Jacob has become way too common. There is even one in my family. I guess if I had a baby and had to choose one name fromthe list, I would pick Drake Henry or I might change the middle name to Drake Wyatt. Sounds okay to me but just might be too manly. Anyway hope I was of some help. Most of your names are nice  because they are not so common.|`|9EdUCTwjaa	I luv the name wyatt, and Rory would be a great middle name too ! I'm not too fond of sullivan, or Abram though...and whitney is a girls name.|`|yH39NEXSaa	My favorite is Drake Henry.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	I love Heath Wyatt and Drake Henry. Some of them are not my favorites like Abram, Cash, and Sullivan. Most of those names remind me of last names or funny nicknames...Also Jake Whitney sounds a little girly, no offense; Whitney is more often referred to as a girl's name. Now I know Whitney was commonly used as a male's name back in the day, just like Shannon, Sydney, etc; but the name now sounds a little silly.<br>  In general your names are very unique which I appreciate because too often these days people are way too serious about other names like Aidan, Isabella, Jaiden, etc. It gets annoying.<br>  <br>  Suggestions:<br>  From your list:<br>  Bennett Henry/Rhys/Sullivan<br>  Jacob Sullivan/Rordan/Henry (Jake)<br>  Drake Sullivan (I kinda like this one)<br>  Heath Abram/Rordan<br>  <br>  suggestions of my own:<br>  Wyatt Matthew<br>  Heath Benjamin<br>  Drake Tyler<br>  Jacob Dawson<br>  Bennett Parker|`|tSEA42Uraa	My very favorites are Drake Henry and Heath Wyatt. Maybe it's my love for Ledger talking, but the name is phenomenal in itself.<br>   <br>  Now, I don't exactly dislike or like the name Abram. I happened to know a person by the name Abram Abram, (first name last) so it sounds cheesy to me now. I also think Cash is a bit more nickname material, if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  I don't particularly "hate" any of them, you have quite nice taste. I love the idea of Heath Sullivan, or Sullivan Heath. Sullivan isn't a favorite of mine, but it goes so nicely with Heath.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ~Emily-Maria<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, wow! I almost didn't remember Bennett or Rhys! I'd like to revise what I said earlier, and give more suggestions:<br>  <br>  Bennett Rhys "Ben; Benny"<br>  Rhys Bennett<br>  Bennett Heath<br>  Heath Bennett<br>  <br>  Ever since Jon & Kate + 8, I've loved the name Bennett. I can't explain why, I just do. And having the nickname Ben used for Bennett instead of Benjamin is a breath of fresh air.|`|WIEPISyeaa	Sullivan Rhys is really cute. :)  9/10<br>  Abram Bennett I don't love.  5/10<br>  Heath Wyatt is cute. :)  8/10<br>  Wyatt Heath is almost as cute. 7/10<br>  Drake Rordan.

miPubuDYaa	Ohhh honey its completely normal. Its called nesting. LOL I've been coming down with it too. I'm 30 weeks today yeah!<br>  <br>  I just realized that we have no curtains on our windows in the living room & dining room. And the baby needs to have curtains! So i had to order 10 panels today! We lived in the apt for 18 months and it didnt bother me until yesterday.<br>  <br>  My husband has caught this alittle too. The normal "Slob king" last week decised the kitchen needed to mopped and mopped then.|`|bxlYleZkaa	No, No, you are simply preparing to build a nest.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	LOL come over here girl !!! i need help u r ok|`|U1RcZjqJaa	You probably just think its too little because you didn't have 2 kids at home with your first two. Now its bringing home a 5th person so I'm sure it seems too tiny.

What you are experiencing is normal. Good Luck!|`|POGZZmoUaa	Are you cleaning just to avoid thinking about something else?  You're not loosing your mind and the size of your home doesn't matter as long as it full of love.

X6as2nOAaa	Do what they say but my doc once told me to give my baby pedialyte so that she didn't get dehydrated and lot's of juice he said. She was getting a little sick and he wanted to keep her hydrated so that is just what I did and I didn't have any issues with it. She is 7 months old now and this happened when she was about 6 months old.|`|tmh42R6Caa	I would do exactly what they said.  I don't believe a 7 month old needs any water unless you're outside in extreme heat often.  When in doubt, call your pediatrician for advice.|`|yea2hci5aa	I would do exactly what the doctor's told you to do.  I know you feel like you have to do more but that's just our natural reaction as mothers.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lRr46ABUaa	You could also feed him some juice just dilute it. lets say 1 oz of juice to 6 oz water.

hfdYg5h3aa	all i can that is the same reason why i haven't had a blood test i am 9 days late.the only difference is my doctor does them but doesn't take my new insurance.my doctor told me that only doctors here do them so i would have to wait for an appt in 2 weeks. it could be that you are because my sister didn't find out till she was 8 weeks and all the girls in my family is just the same.so there is still a chance. wait one more week.|`|76hhm6Quaa	You could be pregnant,but if you have taken multiple HPTs and they|`|Xla2eJveaa	don't order the online test.<br>  <br>  Do you have planned parenthood in your area or around your area? for us in california, planned parenthood visits are free.<br>  <br>  just reading some of the responses you got. clinics CAN deny services.

No doctor's office or hospital can deny care to a patient and they will be perfectly willing to put you on a payment plan. Because you have no insurance right now they may even offer financial aid for medical expenses (my aunt wound up only having to pay a couple hundred dollars of a bill several times that because she asked around filled out the right paperwork in within a certain time period).|`|vigFmfLmaa	Where in the world do you live?  There's a drs office on every corner here that will do blood tests.  Even the hospital will do them.|`|Ox1vB8xwaa	Try planned parenthood, usually its free.<br>  <br>  Go to your primary doctor, and tell him straight up that you want a test.<br>  <br>  I don't know your story, so if you don't want to come out and tell them, just tell your primary doc that you've been having abdominal pain and you'd like an ultrasound to see whats going on.  That's how I found out for sure when I was 18 that I wasn't, and coincidentally, found out I had a kidney stone.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|sIr2fWh6aa	You can go to your primary doctor.. They will do a blood test there with no problem, and give you the results.|`|ESAM0U7xaa	have you tried an urgent care or do u have one near you?|`|aJTBF7opaa	Im not sure where you live, but if at some point you had a primary care physician, or a ob-gyn you should be able to call that office. Tell them you would like them to call in an order for blood work, where ever it is that they go through. That should be it. That's what i did, i didn't have insurance yet so i paid out of pocket, but all i had to pay was for the test and a normal testing facility it was only $25. You may not be pregnant. It may be stress.
96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	Spotting is less than "light". It's just spotting--spots of blood every few hours. It is possible to have pregnancy symptoms without being pregnant, because hormone levels go up in preparation of a possible pregnancy and sometimes it takes a few days or even a week for the levels to go down during and after you get your period.<br>  <br>  No one can tell you if you miscarried. Most women have what is called a chemical pregnancy, which means they conceived, but for some reason the egg either failed to implant or something was wrong and the body expels it on the date or close to the date of a regular period (which is why some women may get positive early pregnancy tests and then a period and a negative test a few days later).<br>  <br>  If you were going through implantation bleeding, it wouldn't be a normal period. It would be just spotting and wouldn't last more than 3 days AT MOST. Honestly if you aren't sure what spotting is, then you're probably not spotting and it's your regular period.<br>  <br>  If it lasts less than three days, I would say go out and buy a pregnancy test just in case. But it's normal to have 'pregnancy' symptoms after ovulation and a few days after your period without actually being pregnant. Good luck.|`|S4DNQkFraa	Lots of woman can get their period while they are pregnant. Spotting is light, very much unlike a period. You can definitely tell the difference. If you miscarried, it would be painful, lots of clots and lots of blood. Go get a test done at planned parenthood or see your doc for a blood test. G/L!|`|LUR9MVaiaa	The best thing to do is buy a pregnancy test you can get one at walmart for around 2-3 bucks.<br>  <br>  Some women experience spotting/cramping at the time of implantation but spotting is light, usually pink or brown, heavier bleeding is not the same thing.<br>  <br>  Some women still get their period while pregnant every month so a period is not always an indication ur not preg. <br>  <br>  On a personal note I experienced alot of pregnancy symptoms when i was anticipating being pregnant, but when i actually turned out to be pregnant i didnt think i was bc i was begining to cramp like i would b4 my period and i was only a few days late. I spotted several times in the first trimester which is scary but everything turned out fine. <br>  <br>  THE BIG THING is if you think ur birthcontrol has failed ALWAYS do a test, but they'll only work a few days b4 ur "missed" period. If ur spotting and it's kinda early for ur normal cycle it might be implantation of the baby, if ur bleeding around ur normal cycle time you're prob not but it's still possible, Take a test its rlly simple and cheap and worth the piece of mind! :)|`|ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people dont want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer<br>  <br>  I will however say this- I asked the question a few days ago- it seems like quite a few women still have a period but are pregnant... if your period is short - or very light or just not normal i would test b/c you could be- if its a regular period - i wouldnt worry... you can also wait and week what happens next month as well|`|h5cFkP35aa	after your period take a pregnancy test. my mother had periods until 6 months with me and my brother so i know its possible. also, menstrual symptoms can be a lot like pregnancy symptoms. the best thing to do is test. good luck.
GWveqx61aa	every woman handles it different, it can take up to 3 years to get a normal cycle back from some types of bc, after coming off it id talk to a dr and tell em you want to start ttc, and see what they suggest, in fact dont wait, if you wait thats the longer you have to wait from the time you decide its time to start, so anyway talk to your dr, good luck|`|vigFmfLmaa	No, mine went crazy when I went off them.  They regulate your cycle when you're on them with the hormones they contain.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	it only regulates while you are on them.
Ox1vB8xwaa	Ok, so your first cycle went from November 30 to December 20.  Cycles are counted from The first day of Aunt Flo to the day before you begin another Aunt Flo.  Ovulation USUALLY occurs 14 days before the beginning of another cycle.  This is typical of women with a 28 day cycle.<br>  <br>  Since you're new to it, I'd recommend using OPKs- or Ovulation Prediction Kits.  They're really easy to use, very similar to HPTs (Home Pregnancy Tests).  Starting the day after your period ends, use one a day, usually FMU (First Morning Urine), and test.  This will give you and idea of when you ovulate.  Problem with the OPKs is that they can be EXPENSIVE, and only give a weeks worth of tests.<br>  <br>  So I'm going to decipher your cycles here for a minute...<br>  <br>  Cycle was November 30 to December 20, Ovulation would be ABOUT 2 weeks/14 days before December 20- so like, Dec. 6th.<br>  <br>  Cycle was December 21 to January 22, Ovulation would be ABOUT 2 weeks/14 days before January 22, so like, Jan. 8th.<br>  <br>  Cycle was January 23 to February 13th Ovulation would be ABOUT 2 weeks/14 days before February 13, so like, Jan. 30/31.<br>  <br>  Your current cycle began Feb. 14th.  This is JUST a guesstimate, but I'm going with Feb. 28th as an ovulation day.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope its cleared up a bit for you!|`|EEdzRCQKaa	well i would say you are 12 days into your cycle i would start now but dont do it every day as there will be low sperm if you do it every day well they also last up to 7 days so get going and good luck|`|s8VY7uReaa	ovulation usually occurs 11-18 days after your last menstruation started..so if you had yours on 14th feb then you may ovulate around 25th up until 6th march or maybe even after that. you can also visit websites which will calculate your estimated ovulation date. Click on google and type in ovulation calender. Im TTC too.<br>  Baby dust to you. i hope you get positive results ;)
ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people don't want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer<br>  <br>  I will however give you my experience<br>  last month i had sex- obviously cuz that's the only way to get preggers... a few days later i spotted- i never spot- never- then nothing for 2 days then i got what seemed like a period but it was early and only lasted 2 days vs the reg. 4-5 days.... im thinking what is going on w/my body? i took a test a week later- i think i took it wrong tho- anyways it was neg... but i still felt preggers- i decided to wait and low and behold i got my period again- today- early again cept its really light... and i know you can have bleeding when pregnant - so i am going to wait and see if its gone in 2 days like the last- if it is i am going to retest... my periods shouldnt be only 2 days<br>  oh and my breasts never get sore- never - even during my period- so i wouldnt know about the breast thing<br>  i hope this helps you out.
dUVPyyUsaa	She's probably pregnant, dogs are only pregnant for 9 weeks, so 2 weeks is not too early to notice symptoms. Let her rest alot and start feeding her puppy food.|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	once the dogs connect and get stuck together they are pregnant. hope thats the answer you was looking for.|`|6f54cfe561a33f4d3976270a0c53628caa	first off wrong section!<br>  second off yes its too early to tell, the vet can do a bloodtest at 2 weeks but its not always accurate, the only way to know for sure is a sonogram at 30 days. <br>  and finally, it sounds like you did it on purpose, you kept track so well each & every time they locked up! if you didn't want it to happen why keep them together!! just more mutts, who'll end up in the pound!!
47f68597748b8362993a581aa0e99a14aa	This is a decision best left to your doctor.|`|vue9NOhYaa	If the baby's are well positioned for a vaginal birth, then that's always the safest option.<br>  <br>  If one (or both)  is breech or transverse, you'll probably need a c-section.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	c-sections should only be done if medically necassery.|`|FXINmF6saa	Well I wouldn't want to do a c-section either. If healing completely from a vaginal birth takes 6 months a c-section will take up to a year. And when you have a c-section you have to be in complete rest for at least 60 days in order for the wound not to open up, and with twins I'm sure you will have to get up to help with the babies. It's going to be allot harder to recover from that with 2 babies in the house and plus 3 other kids. I would most definitely recommend going with a vaginal labor so you can recover and be in less pain allot less and with your kids allot more. And if your worried about you not being able to do it just remember you could always get an epidural. Just think that if Nadya (the chick who had 8 babies) could have her octoplets vaginally why can't you. You'll be ok I'm sure but in the end it's your choice not the doctor's. Good luck! =)|`|VGoCh2C9aa	it depends how they are sitting closer the time but a lot of the time c-section. i had a c-section as one of mine was head down and the other upside down. they wont know till you are quite far gone.|`|9P26sacKaa	Because a c-section is major surgery and really compromises your ability to care for yourself and your children after delivery, as well as having many risks for you and your babies, it would most likely to best to have a vaginal delivery unless there is some medical reason not to do so.  If you're doctor is willing to do a vaginal delivery with you, then you honestly have one of the best doctors in the country.  Many doctors want to give a c-section to every woman who doesn't have a classic, textbook birth, which is one reason why the c-section rates in this country are so dangerously high.  You might also have a hard time getting a VBAC with future children if you had a c-section, unless you have this same doctor, who is probably very good and would do a VBAC.<br>  <br>  Premature babies tend to do better when born vaginally and have fewer breathing problems.  Because twins are usually born in the timeframe that would make singletons premature, this is something to consider.  <br>  <br>  Possible considerations include position of the babies at term, where the cords are, how the placentas look, etc.  <br>  <br>  There is a great web site about c-section awareness and information and support for ICAN (International Cesarean Awareness Network).  There are forums and email lists, as well as a ton of information on the web site itself.  It's definitely worth getting onto the site and poking around, as well as going onto the community sections and asking about twin vaginal versus cesarean birth.  There are many, many women who have gone both ways and would be happy to talk about it with you, sharing their experiences and their decision-making process, the risks and benefits of each choice and all that.  The web site is <a href="http://www.ican-online.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ican-online.org</a><br>  <br>  Another consideration is that if you did decide to have an elective c-section, it is usually better for the babies to wait until labor starts on its own (at least you are having regular contractions) and go in at that point.  This ensures that the babies are ready to be born and will allow them some of the hormones of labor that are important for transitioning to the outside world.  This would be a consideration and something to discuss with your doctor if you did decide to have surgery.  Because you've already had three kids, it would be important in this scenario to go into the hospital very early in your labor to avoid having the babies vaginally anyhow (assuming you didn't want to do this).<br>  <br>  I would personally have twins vaginally unless there was some clear reason not to do so.  I also would not consider breech presentation (of either twin) to be a good medical reason not to deliver vaginally, especially after having three kids already (meaning your pelvis is obviously adequate, and twins are usually smaller anyhow).<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision!|`|4ZJhve83aa	I am a twin and my mother did us vaginal. Reason why she did is because the fact being, if she had a c-section done she would have been out even longer. When you do have a c-section done you are worse off because of the fact you don't want to tare the insis. open by getting up and down and lifting stuff that is over 3-5lbs. Look at the basics. c-section longer recovery. vaginal get to do what ever after birth. Beside that I was kid #5 and my twin was kid #6. And my mom doesn't have a big scare acoss her stomach that will be there for the rest of her life. It comes down to what you would do. Just look at the pros and cons and what you think would be best for you and your children. Also keep in mind. if you decide to have a c-section. there is a good chance of infection of the insis. and if that happens then you will be in the hospital even longer.
4TqUgtpzaa	What really helps is to take a bit of a time out from situations that upset you so you can think about whats going on. Don't snap right away- give yourself some time to calm down before you speak your mind.<br>  <br>  When I was younger, I had a really bad attitude. From the time I was about 13-16, I was really angry and I would start fights with everyone in my house. At 21, I look back and I am almost embarrassed by the way I treated my family. But most of all, I am ashamed. I know what you are going through, and it is hard to control anger sometimes. Just give yourself some alone time to cool down and come to your senses before you say or do something you will regret.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	You need to take some time to think before you act. Don't just blurt out the first thing you think off, or do the first thing that comes to mind.|`|UtjdtsjYaa	i had the same problem. i had a bad attitude and i got introble with ym apretns. thsi si what you should and need to so(THIS IS ADVIDE, you DON'Thave to use it).<br>  <br>  ok you need to write down the things thatr your paretns say you need to change, or work on.<br>  <br>  1. attude<br>  2. dressing<br>  3. friends<br>  4. boys<br>  5. attitude( i don't kow what u t r going through but u do these are just examples)(K) <br>  <br>  once you have a list highlight the ones that you know you can fix, the thing you want to fix.<br>   like your attitude. really i know it is hard to fix but you have to one way or the other. k<br>  this is what you do. <br>  <br>  you said you were praying about it,s o i take ti you tralk to God.

ZNhP3mpUaa	No. I mean i wouldn't go huffing it or anything, but the smell of cat litter is not toxic. Just the feces IN it... we have multiple cats and I change the litter daily... you SHOULD though, stay away from it as much as possible to avoid the risk of toxoplasmosis. but your right. never touch or handle used litter.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	No, the issue with the cat box is a parasite called toxoplasmosis that is carried in hunting cat's feces. It has nothing to do with the litter at all.|`|bxlYleZkaa	I'd be very surprised if any kind of aroma had any affect on an unborn baby! And touching cat litter can have no affect either!! Who ever has been telling you such things?|`|JQcIwPXJaa	Cat feces can contain a parasite called toxoplasmosis that can cause symptoms similar to a cold, but can be very harmful to an unborn child. I have two cats and my husband is in charge of cleaning the cat box. You can only get it from contact with the feces or container that they are in. It is not a problem to breathe in the air because it isn't an airborne parasite. Just make sure that someone else keeps the cat box clean and the area surrounding it. If you do come in to contact make sure to wash your hands thoroughly and disinfect the area regularly.<br>  I keep lysol disinfectant spray and spray the outside of the box daily so that if it is there it won't spread around my house.|`|S4DNQkFraa	I wouldn't think so. I mean, if you're sitting next to it and breathing it in for a while, probably. I lived with people who had cats and she was pregnant and would use the bathroom that had the litter box in it and she and the baby are fine. The baby was born on time and very healthy. I believe he was almost 9 pounds. If you're truly worried about it, ask your doctor or just move the litter box to a new location or don't go near it. G/L!!|`|0SIhrYCbaa	No, its not the litter itself thats the problem.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Breathing it in is fine, just don't clean the tray out or touch it. Cat poop carrys toxoplasmosis and sometimes salmonella which can be very bad for an unborn baby, it can also be bad for us ourselves.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	mmm i wouldnt say so- but i would have someone else clean it.... getting too close to the litter box could cause you to inhale a small amount of the ammonia in cat urine, and thats not good for baby.|`|VT24zOomaa	nope breathing is fine, and the cat litter is not the concern, it is the cat feces. it has toxins in it.|`|SRAnMfEPaa	It is best for u not to cange the litter box at all, bc of the toxins in the fetes, and u dont want to inhale the smell.|`|lZO3kfoyaa	Cat litter is fine. It's the cat poop that has toxins in it that are bad to breath in while pregnant.
GWveqx61aa	i heard about this, asked my dr, he says it is ok to use, i used pasturized that way i know it didnt have bacteria, if you use a real egg make sure not touse any of the yolk, thats where the infection risks are. it worked great as a lubricant, and i am due for af in the next couple days, i have no signs of pregnancy (except darker areolas)or af,hope this helps._good luck and baby dust to us all_|`|vigFmfLmaa	Um, no.  I'm trying to be serious but you TTC newbies tickle me sometimes.  Your cervical mucus should appear thicky and stretchy, similar to raw egg whites, right before you ovulate.  You aren't actually supposed to do anything with raw egg whites.  Unless you're into that kind of thing... LOL.  Again, just teasing!|`|H9t63i4Kaa	I have heard that it helps, its the same exact consistency found in cervical mucus just before ovulation. It cant hurt to try!!!! Good luck, if it works for you, let me know so I can try lol!!! This link should help some!<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would try Mucinex, it helps to thin out cm. I would try this first! Mucinex has a drug in it-the same thats found in robitussin, that thins out mucus in your body, It has had proven results to make your cm thin and stretchy.|`|xwZKouCIaa	Raw egg whites DO NOT make you more fertile, people just use these egg whites as a lubircant that wont kill the sperm, but i dpont reccommend you do this because raw eggs tend to be associated with the bacteria salmonella and you dont want salmonella down there :/ <br>  if you want to increase your chances of getting pregnant then u should buy and ovulation predictor kit that can help guide you about when exactly are your most fertile days**  good luck** if you STILL  have trouble getting pregnant then go see a doctor and see what your options are as far as fertility treatments|`|Ldvi6UPOaa	I've heard of this working before for lubrication not to make you fertile, but you really have to be careful because it can cause an infection because of salmonella.Try using Preseed. It works wonders for people who are not producing enough Egg White Cervical Mucus (EWCM) which is what you need to help the sperm travel to your fallopian tubes so that it can fertilize the egg. You can go on www.preseed.com to check what locations in your area sell Preseed. I bought mine online at amazon.com but you can find it on ebay or <a href="http://www.early-pregnancy-tests.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.early-pregnancy-tests.com/.</a><br>  <br>  Preseed is a sperm friendly lubricant that mimics EWCM and it safer then actual raw egg whites.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!!!|`|s8VY7uReaa	iv heard the egg white helps towards the sperm...so hopefully...and do you keep a diary of when you ovulate?  the ovulation period is the time where you are most likely to conceive. Keep a note of when you start your menstruation and when you finish,,also how long you menstruate for and how long the cycle is. Also tell your husband to get cashew, pistachio,almond,brazilian nuts...blend them and mix with warm milk and drink it. this will help the sperm and also give warmth to his body. make sure he eats fish,red meat and veggies too as they are very good as well. He has to avoid spicy and sour food. Good luck i hope you do become preg. Baby dust to you :)
Dvx9JquIaa	If the real father's name is not on the birth cetificate, then who's name is?|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	It doesn't make any difference if his name is not on the BC, he still has to sign away his rights. Check with a lawyer.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	i would seek legal advice, but i believe the real father has to sign his rights away|`|7JEojMgQaa	How are you going to ask someone if their name isn't present to identify them to ask? If you used a fake name, then you either have to fess up to that or find someone with that name to say they are in fact that child's parent. If there is NO name on the birth certificate then who are you going to ask? The answer is no. He has no rights if he is not named. <br>  <br>  That still doesn't mean what you are doing is right. A child deserves to know both sets of ancestry. You will be eliminating one of them with an amended birth certificate unless you intend to tell your child who their father is.|`|AA12174100	even if the fathers name is not on the birth certificate, the agency or lawyer handling this will ask who the father is, if you don't tell then you are lieing and possibly committing perjury.

When you say partner I hope you mean your spouse because they don't let boyfriends or girlfriends adopt ones children. You must be married to the person.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	If you know the bio fathers name then you'll need to put his name in your local newspaper and at least try to find him to give him the option of terminating rights or keeping them.

d7kGopYxaa	Well, i would suggest letting her shave. You said it yourself it sucks. But get it in her mind once she starts shaving hair will come back fast and darker. Show her how to shave.<br>  <br>  Edit- If she has sensitive skin DO NOT use nair! even the sensitive skin one. Its hurts so bad!|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Just use Nair or some thing like that. You'd have to do it for her. I would, poor kid. Just her legs but she will be thrilled.|`|eeGN977eaa	Let her try the Smooth Away as seen on tv stuff. I have it and it works. It takes longer than shaving but I think it would be a good compromise for your daughter.|`|AA11537580	try  hair remover cream so long as you do a test patch to know she isn't allergic.<br>  she may cut her legs shaving as she is so young|`|AA11310070	If it's really that bad, and she's being teased, then use nair or something on her legs.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Since it's such a problem for her I would let her go ahead and shave her legs.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	Let her shave! If it is causing her embarrassment and teasing it is not an issue. teach her how to do it right though. <br>  there are other options too: <br>  They make that little pad that rubs it off, it works pretty good but you have to use lots of lotion after wards<br>  there is also the creams, but test for reaction in a small area first|`|LIzhntw8aa	use this amazing product called smooth away it works so well but it does have that smell kinda like rubber but it comes with lotion that takes away the smell <br>  <br>  PS if your daughter wants to shave then let her but don'tt listen to other people about nair it wokrs very well just dont keep it on for more than 2 minutes|`|LLuxq8Fgaa	My daughter is 7, and has the same problem.  I shave her legs for her...but only in the summer when she is wearing short pants and shorts.

0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	You're pregnant, congratulations. The second test, that was negative, was incorrect and probably because you have taken it so early, and your urine was too dilute.  Take one again tomorrow morning to be sure, but I'll buy you an ice cream cone if I'm wrong.|`|aD7kHTJNaa	if u just missd ur period then yes u peed toooo soon after the first one.

xy5UNiELaa	I searched ECF on ultrasound and found this:  Echogenic Cardiac Focus<br>   <br>  An echogenic cardiac focus (ECF, also known as echogenic chordae) refers to a bright spot seen in the fetal heart by ultrasound. <br>  <br>  Causes of ECF<br>  An echogenic focus is not a sign of a heart defect.

GWveqx61aa	it does slow or kill sperm when put in heat like that, and sperm will rephresh its self, so dont give up,, maybe you two werent in there long enuf for it to affect them?well id keep trying, sorry i cant help you more, good luck and baby dust to us all|`|vigFmfLmaa	Jacuzzis or anything hot near the testicles can decrease sperm survival.  They are supposed to be kept cool and away from the body.  It takes about 75 days for new sperm to be produced.  Most ejaculate contains 100-200 million sperm; sitting in a hot tub a couple nights isn't going to kill every one.  But if your guy already has male fertility issues those should be avoided.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	hot tubs may make the sperm slower, but it doesnt make them go away. you can definatly still get pregnant by having sex in a hot tub.|`|z8YGEk0qaa	I was conceived in a hot tub

SAJitWLfaa	I have a seven year old son and a five year old son who are very much the same way, it's not a stage they're going through, it's not because of problems at home, it's not because of bad parenting!! What it is with My boys is that they're incredibly bright and and they grasp more than a typical child they're age would. The news on TV is sad, as an adult we know that crying over it won't help. Life is very hard for "grown ups" let alone children and once again as adults we know that crying won't help! <br>  As a Mother you know that medicating because she is more attentive to difficult situations than other kids is wrong. I fully agree!<br>  The problem is that she understands more than she knows how to express properly. She will learn how in time.<br>  You should be very proud ,as I am of my Kids. Being sensitive to others feelings is a good thing. Being aware of world issues at her age is an awesome sign of maturity and she just needs someone to help her understand that we can't fix everything.<br>  You are a great Mom to be asking this question, please don't let uneducated opinions get you down!|`|xp71kN68aa	SHE PROBALY HAS OCD  I HAVE OCD AND DO THE SAME EXACT THING ASK A DOCTER TO PUT HER<br>   ON ZANXA|`|HEs6bzOtaa	I wouldn't say so<br>  there year 7 lol|`|n1vKoto7aa	As the mom, you know best. If this is the first you have heard about it from someone else, I would just keep an eye on your daughter for awhile and see how things go. If, however, other people have also mentioned this (friends, relatives) you might want to look into it more seriously. A lot of children go through normal phases where they worry about things like current events, their parents getting sick or dying, or natural disasters, especially if it's come up recently (but not necessarily). Again, you know your daughter better than anyone. You know what she needs most.|`|OOPPTQuVaa	lol no not too many girls have anxiety at 7 i can think of 1. And maybe if your girl has problems it could be from problems at home.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Keep an open mind and really consider what the teacher said. It might be that because you are the same way you don't see it as a problem. Look at it from your daughter's point of view - she's only 7, should she really be this burdened by these kind of things?

So, if you're not into that, check out Ashely. Keep in mind, the quality isn't all there, but you pay for what you get when it comes to furniture  unless you get used furniture. You can also look at your local Craigslist.<br>  <br>  Ashley furniture is better than Wal-Mart. I would highly advise against Wal-Mart furniture, unless you are wanting disposable furniture. It'll more than likely fall apart, eventually. <br>  <br>  Check out JC Penny online, too.|`|eeGN977eaa	You can buy a cheap one from Walmart. We always give the cheap dressers re-enforcement when we put them together so they last longer. We put carpenters glue on the seams and add extra nails.

jLYTKr33aa	I never give to people going door to door unless it's someone I know.  You did the right thing, as it's probably a scam.

zwJbUbWMaa	Well, it would have been better for everyone involved if you had realized this much earlier in the relationship but what's done is done and if you feel that much better now then you probably are doing the right thing.<br>  <br>  She is probably upset because a single mom is probably always thinking in terms of a complete family and what is best for her children from the beginning of the relationship and now she has to start her search over.  You are getting a college education and she probably realized that you would have been a good father for her kids.|`|SUKdrAkGaa	you shouldnt feel wrong for doing that.  it does suck that there are kids involved, but that is not your fault or responsibility.  in the future, if you do date someone with children, dont meet the kids until you know the relationship is serious|`|paHbLR9aaa	I really only read a few lines of that.

Kids or no kids, whoever you meet needs to be right for you, and take your time!!  The worst thing you could have done was to stick around just for the kids, as that is not healthy for you or her, so you made the right choice.|`|yea2hci5aa	If you're not into her then let her know now before she thinks it's getting really serious!

Hopefully she can be strong for her kids and explain to the older one at least that its is not there fault and that they can still be friends. But you know what it is a part of life and the fact that you care is a good sign that you will handle the situation with care for these kids but in the end it is up to there mother to help them through this.

5Um59Muhaa	I think that you shouldn't ground him for very long, but it depends on his intentions. If he was going outside to deliberately disobey you, then he should be grounded longer. If he forgot or didn't know that he was supposed to stay inside, then don't ground him very long. Also, if he is genuinely sorry about what he did, not just sorry he got caught, then don't ground him very long. Or, instead of grounding him, just discuss it with him, and ask him if he knows why it was wrong to disobey you, why he should have stayed inside, what to do next time, and tell him that there will be punishment next time, otherwise he will keep on doing it, thinking that there will be no punishment in the future. I hope I helped, and I hope all goes well!     ~Crystal|`|yYOh0DUjaa	Why would you tell a 12 year old boy he can't play in the snow!? Sorry, but that is hard to resist.    Anyway, I think a couple days. I've been in this situation and being locked out in the snow is punishment enough.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Since "they" are locked out, I'm assuming he took his younger siblings outside to play?  Did you specifically tell them NOT to go outside?  If not, he may feel like he's doing what you told him -- he IS watching them after all, if they ALL went outside to play.  If he disobeyed you and went outside when you told him not to, then I might punish him for the night, but no longer.  It's difficult for kids to ignore snow and as I said, he might feel like he's doing what you told him -- he's playing with and watching after the siblings.  Anyone can get locked out of the house, I'm sure you've done it yourself. I know I have.  As annoying as it can be to have to go home to let them back in, I wouldn't punish them too severely.    Also, I agree with another answer who pointed out the thing about the age -- legally in most areas, a 12 year old is not old enough to be left alone "in charge" of other children.  Speaking of maturity alone (and no legal aspect), a 12 year old is not mentally or intellectually developed enough to realize the dangers that might arise by taking his younger siblings outside alone -- or of the many other dangers that could happen around the house.  It was very risky of you to leave them all home alone.  You have to remember his developmental stage at the age of 12 and punish accordingly.  As I've said several times already, he may think (and rightfully so) that he was doing exactly what you told him to do by taking care of his siblings.  He kept them with him (hence they all got locked out) just as you told him to do.|`|5xqw8fijaa	You should NEVER leave children home alone with a child (12)!  Who knows what could have happened to them?    Yeah, you should probably ground him for disobeying you, but you are also responsible.  You don't leave children alone with children.|`|F4ssiKw4aa	I don't think you should ground him, but if you feel strongly that you should (you know best) it should be for a week or less, because it was not that mischievous of an action. Maybe he learned his lesson by locking himself out.|`|bAnuAm97aa	i wouldnt ground him, it would be torture enough to  be locked out in the cold for awhile. that would be  his punishment.|`|AA11927081	i don't think you should ground him, but tell him that since he went outside without your permission, you will take away his phone. tell him that very bad things can happen when you're outside too long and/or someone could take him...plus legally you can't leave kids like that home alone duuh.|`|XXw7DUDRaa	lock him in a tower and beat him ever so often|`|JdFgf575aa	Yes, you should ground him that was VERY irresponsible.   2 weeks. At the LEAST.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Ground him for two weeks.  He needs to take responsibility seriously.|`|xOiafJpoaa	I wouldn't, being locked out in the snow is enough, but if you must, about a day or so...
TwVd0etQaa	oh my god i had the same thing ! My ex best friend used to say all the time she was pregnant. Like she would be on her period and be like 'you can still have periods and be pregnant' but then would ask to lend a condom when a lad came over. It got that bad that she was constantly saying it every time she was due, that one day my friend flipped out on her. She screamed saying 'god you have been pregnant for four years! your so concerned on being pregnant you forgot to pop it out!' which was funny at the time but my friend ran off in a huff. You need to be honest with her, they do it for attention. We don't talk no more because she nicked MY positive pregnancy tests (which i later miss-carried) and told her boyfriend she was pregnant and got 200 pounds out of him. One way to catch her out is buy her a pregnancy test and tell her to take it while your there, she can hardly say no if she has nothing to hide. Good luck :)
Sg6QxAvHaa	oh wow I am so glad a came across your question, i have been so worried. I would be 5 weeks and 4 days and i have noticed a change in my breast but there not to sore and havent been sick.

The reason you arent feeling any symtoms is either your never gonna get them or because your HCG levels arent high enough for your body to realy respond to it.  Good luck dont worry.

I'm glad you don't want to pressure him into it.|`|AA10390690	It's a private matter for you and your boyfriend and now that people know of it, he's probably feeling a bit uneasy. If he isn't ready then he isn't ready, you'll have to respect that. And maybe it's a good thing. Regardless if you be safe or not, things can happen. I was "safe" as well and had the condom broke, stuff like that happens. Be ready for any thing as when you get into the "moment" mistakes are made as well.|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	This is one of the many reason people say 16 yr olds aren't to have sex. There is a lack of maturity.  I'm not saying this to be mean.  It is just a fact. Talk it out with him, if he doesn't believe you, show him your not ready.  If he can't trust what you say, he isn't a person you should be having sex with anyway.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Tell him you'd rather have sex with him when he feels ready and confident than have sex with him now when he feels peer pressured into doing it.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	See, you never tell your mates stuff like that!    Just wait until you are both ready.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Okay. I'm in the same situation as you. Me + my boyfriend are 16 and spoke it through fully. If you think he doesn't believe you, then it don't seem like you both are ready. Maybe you should wait out a little longer.....|`|UFo1Fnqcaa	you should wait
YJNql5Mgaa	My daughter is 4 months (tomorrow) too!  My mom made a comment when we saw her once, that she was surprised that my daughter wasn't all scratched up.  She goes "Some babies faces look like a nail war zone!"     I think people will understand that your son scratches himself (and you too, probably). :) I believe he'll grow out of it.  Keep clipping his nails.  I have to clip my daughter's constantly too.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Yeah my son used to do that and I felt the same way and it seemed no one else's baby did it, he had scratches all over his head, I would trim his nails and he still managed to scratch his head, he did grow out of it maybe right around 4 months or 4.5 months, I don't remember exactly.  I am sure he will grow out of it, you just have to trim the nails and deal with it for now.|`|EHrysQcCaa	After you trim his nails, use an emory board to take off the sharp edge.  Trimming them that often actually makes them sharper, so you might want to do it only once a week or so. After a while he will stop doing it, a lot of kids go through this, by the time you get a handle on it he will be doing some new behavior. Welcome to the never ending stages of babies.|`|1f440895db82d46ea39724bf6ad660e1aa	My son did the same thing! He would have scratches all over his face and sometimes his legs. He outgrew it a while ago. He is now almost 9 months old and hasn't done it for quite some time.  I think you are doing everything that can be done and now you just have to wait it out. Good luck.|`|rnTNu6MTaa	try to trim his nail as often as you can :) . I was baby sitting a 2 months old and i was cutting his nails all the time cuz they grow faster. And never had problems after that :)

I do like Amari.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Taneeka  (usually spelled Tanika)  is a somewhat common name in African American families.  It is very beautiful name, IMO and very feminine.    Amari- No. Sorry.  Don't like it.  Too harsh sounding.  Like a product.    How about a compromise of the two names?    Tawny? Tanni?   Anika? Amika?   Nekeesha? Nikita?    Just making it up as I go along.

Its your child so its all about what you and him want. Just remember that this baby is going to have this name for at least 18 years, so make sure you are both super pleased about it. Or hey if you want you can name the baby Amari Taneeka (insert last name here), so its a compromise.|`|F44b2np9aa	How about Tamika??    I love Amari and have never met anyone with that name - remember to choose a name you both like:)|`|McRoWQrAaa	Amari is pretty, i like it|`|2TrHH0rkaa	What about Amara? Amari is still nice too but I'm not so keen on Taneeka. Amara Jane or Amara Noelle would sound pretty :)|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I wouldn't.|`|ZwodvOWXaa	yeah i would have to agree with you|`|qoaivLfpaa	yuck....I don't like it, but that's just my opinion!|`|AA12225439	it's not a bad name|`|6OplSEQkaa	I think both are ghetto and Hispanic I hate them they're retarded.|`|j2qrOjo1aa	no bc it rhymns with sneaker|`|LDkZEqqsaa	Amari is ok if u prounouce it (oh-MAR-ee)  I also like Whitney or Devon or Jordan  maybe even Farah?|`|uC9iiQqVaa	No dont like that name   sorry|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	No. Never ever ever ever EVER.|`|kVc0e6RZaa	I know a Taneeka  but I don't like the name. I like Tania or Tania (Ta-neee-ah)|`|9OjnbiDEaa	i would never name my kid that i sounds like u sneezed and then made it a name|`|IN6weFmlaa	no but i would consider:          tasha jade        alissa can'ee(kah-ne)         shalese renea|`|OnDIrxNEaa	No, I'd never name my daughter Taneeka.  I would think too many people would call it a "ghetto" name.  I knew a mixed girl whose name was Tianna, which I think is pretty and semi-ethnic without going overboard.  I also like Delora.

PQw92IGHaa	I think you should tell them that you are pregnant and you both are very excited.  They want their daughter to be happy.  If they react worried about you being financially able address that when it happens, they could be just as excited for you both!      Also, maybe if you sit down and look at your finances and are able to give the multiple ways that you guys are going to make this work they will be relieved to know that you are making this a priority and have thought about this in a mature way.|`|bCcQBG23aa	I know exactally where your coming from!  Im 22 in a month and have been with my boyfriend for 5 years and we struggle financially day to day which stresses out my parents alot.  We have one son who is now 18months old and Im 6months pregnant again.  With my first son I didnt even tell them, they just kinda found out on their own.   I want to tell them this time so my only ideas are too either   a) try the A&W thing and tell them  or    b) get my son a little sweatshirt that says BIG BROTHER on it and let them notice it and then tell them.    Good luck|`|U7Fvw8g7aa	I think that you and your boyfriend should look for a  source of income that will help you through the pregnancy, delivery and the first year of the baby to say the least since this will be a major concern on your part. Talk to your boyfriend on how you will deal with the situation. I guess you guys are already mature enough to deal with this situation on your own. After you guys talk about your plans as a couple and as parents then the two of you can face your parents and his and tell them. I suggest that you guys do it in a public place. Show your parents that you guys are mature enough to handle things on your own and you're just sharing the good news with them and informing them of your plans so they don't have to worry. After all, having a baby is a huge responsibility of yours and your partner and not your parents. It's time to motivate yourself to be very responsible.|`|K0SOqyAbaa	just tell them bring your boyfriend with you. i think that at first they'll be worried and mad but than they'll be over joyed about it!|`|3c724f5ab73b7356d0f55d16d18e2019aa	Wait until u get an ultrasound if u haven't done it yet. Then show them the picture,but do it over dinner.In a public restaurant so no one can make a scene. Buy them a gift that says something about being a grand parents. Get them a Mylar balloon that says congratulations. Then get a card that says your gonna be grand parents. Other than that find a settle way, but u have to do it the best way u see fit. Besides u are grown woman. U  can get some help from welfare as soon as the baby comes. Medicaid will foot the bills for the hospital and medicines and  medical needs for u and the child.|`|4qlNDbNLaa	I was in a similar situation. I had just quit my job to return to school for my masters. We were not yet married although we were planning to get married before finding out. He is our "bread winner" although, it's not much so financially speaking we weren't really ready yet. I think many couples aren't ready, but find a way to make it work. I think it is too simple for someone to say "you have to be financially stable" before having a baby. In my case, it was not a planned pregnancy-but a very wonderful surprise. We are adults and knew the consequences of our actions, but that didn't stop us and for the record I wouldn't change a thing about how it has all happened!    Now, as for how to tell your parents. I was at the dog park with my mom and our dogs. I knew it was a nice day, neutral ground, and I was so happy I didn't think it would go poorly. I simply asked my mom how she felt about being a "real grammy" (she hates that term, so that is what I call her when talking about my dog-to him she is his grammy.) She could feel my excitement and was very happy. Her main concern was that we were not married and what I would do about school. I told her that I was happy about the pregnancy and so was my boyfriend (now husband).    I sugguest you approach it when you think the time and situation (setting, surrounding) are right. Let your excitement show, if you paren't are only concerned about how you'll make it financially then I'm guessing they'll still be rather supportive. Life happens, and you can't stop it or worry about what others say. They may be shocked at first, but I would be willing to bet after the first few months they'll be very excited!    Good luck!|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Don't listen to the idiots of the world.  If you waited until you were "financially ready" to have a child, you never would.  The species would end.  I have never, ever heard of a savings fund created for the soul purpose of "having a baby in the future".  You may save towards the future, but you will never save enough to have a child.    Take it one step at a time, and don't be afraid to go into charity shops, because a lot of clothing is never worn, tags still on, and cheap as anything, and you could get it.  Get larger items from friends, if their baby has grown out of moses baskets, cots etc and they are not going to use it again, offer to buy or take it off their hands for a little money.  You will manage.    Your parents may worry slightly, but will probably be thrilled, after all, it was their parent's generation that would say "just stick another tattie in the pot" when their 12th child was born.     It is a modern concept that you must be rich to have children, they do not need gap, next, mammas and pappas, bugaboo frogs and such as like.    Poundstretcher, Peacocks, Ethel Austins, Argos, Charity Shops, Ikea do a cot for 20.00 - all these places were made for mums on a budget.  Plus, if someone in the family says I want to buy some things for the baby is this ok?  Tear their hand off!    Congratulations on your wonderful news.|`|37PpYx8oaa	Ummmm.  You're an adult.  Are you scared they're going to ground you?  They probably won't be happy about you not being married.  But they probably will be very happy to have a grandbaby!    So here's how:  "Mom, Dad.  I'm pregnant."|`|DNygQdmVaa	just tell them. they might not approve but theyll get over it and be excited!|`|e800d2182f5490a71079dce72530ceebaa	honestly, you should have thought about your financial situation before getting pregnant.  Even if it was an accident just say to your parents that your really wanted a child and you think the right time is now, and that you are working on your financial situation.  Whatever you say DO NOT let them know it was an accident, because it would just make them disappointed and probably unhappy about you.
96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	If you don't want to become pregnant AGAIN, then you have to wait the six weeks and be put on birth control--no doctor will prescribe any type of birth control (except condoms) until after you six week checkup--that's why you should wait.<br>  <br>  After a woman gives birth she is very fertile, and becoming pregnant so soon after giving birth puts both mother and baby at a higher risk for complications during pregnancy. For one, your uterus is still downsizing and weak and may not handle another pregnancy right away as well as it should or could.<br>  <br>  The difference between waiting and not waiting six weeks could show up nine months later. So like I said, if you don't want anymore, just wait the six weeks. Good luck.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	You know what - Go ahead, mess your internal system up and that way for the little moment of desired, gotta have it at that moment mess up the whole process and that way no more in the future.<br>  <br>  Gurl, be patient.  It's worth the wait.<br>  <br>  /jerome|`|vue9NOhYaa	You don't *have to* do anything. It's your body.<br>  <br>  Doctors do recommend waiting until your 6 week check-up, so they can be sure everything is healed up.<br>  <br>  But if you have stopped bleeding and feel up to it, give it a try.  If it hurts, stop.|`|C0GeEv7kaa	My husband and I had sex 4 weeks after because that's when he came home on his leave from Iraq and everything is fine, but I also didn't have any tearing and my bleeding is very minimal. We just did it this past friday, lol.<br>  <br>  PS-I wasn't allowed to leave the hospital without birthcontrol and started it 2 weeks post partum. We also used condoms. At 6 weeks I'll get my IUD.|`|s1utniuvaa	It you want to chance getting an infection then go ahead and have sex. I know I sound harsh but there are reasons you are supposed to wait 6 weeks.|`|WPI0Z47saa	The doctor won't prescribe birth control until your 6 week check up. With a c- section I was allowed to have sex 2 weeks later but with a vaginal they just want to make sure you are healed first.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Yes.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Your body needs to heal and you are at greater risk of an infection if you do this before your six week check up.<br>  <br>  However, I must admit that I did not wait with my first two children. The worst that happened in my case was breaking the stitches. <br>  <br>  For you, since you're wanting to immediately prevent pregnancy, you're best bet is wait until you're able to get on birth control before having intercourse. I got pregnant immediately after deliverying my 2nd child - and I mean immediately! (About 2 weeks after which would probably have placed conception at the first time we had intercourse.) <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if you're nursing your infant, there are certain birth controls that you can't begin until after 6 weeks anyway. <br>  <br>  I think the best thing for you may be to get Mirena or an IUD since you obviously don't seem interested in a tubal ligation (having your tubes tied.)  But you also have to wait six weeks for either one of those. <br>  <br>  You could try condoms (which would also minimize the risk of infection) but be sure to use it with some type of spermicide as a back up that would actually work. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations on your new baby!|`|3vzxSKLcaa	Not neccesarily, but you should wait until around that time.  I waited until about 5 weeks or so.  It's mainly if you feel comfortable with it.  If you start and it hurts or feel uncomfortable, then stop and tell your doc when you go for your postnatal app.t|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	You should wait at least for and if you do it then you need to use protection so you don't get pregnant. They recommend you wait so everything can heal my doc said 4-6 weeks. I waited the full 6 but then again I had no sex drive at that point!|`|6cwJi5kxaa	You have to let your body heal. Maybe you should wait so you dont have any more kids. I know its hard but you need to wait.|`|h85kkDsbaa	I tried after about 2 weeks and it really hurt, i just wasn't ready so i waited another 2 weeks and that was fine. X|`|G3sSeUataa	I waited 4 weeks.  As long as u aren't bleeding you should be fine.  It's your body do what you want!|`|Ms8b2kISaa	I didn't wait the entire 6 weeks either! My doctor told me that I just had to wait for everything to heal from my episiotomy (sp?), and then I would be able to feel if it was OK or not. I wasn't on BC before I got pregnant (well, obviously), so when she gave me my prescription for them at my first check up with her (which was about 1-2 weeks after delivery), she just told me to start them when I got my first period, which did end up being about 4-6 weeks after I had my son. Hopefully this helps a little! Good luck!|`|AA10248939	You should wait the 6 weeks before resuming sexual activity.  Your body and female organs have just gone through a traumatic upheaval and need ther 6 weeks to 'regroup' as it returns to normalcy hormone wise and other.  If you are nursing your infant DO NOT TAKE BIRTH CONTROL PILLS or any other medication without the advise of your doctor.  You transfer the drugs to your baby through the milk.  You can get pregnant during these 6 weeks, especially if you know when your normal fertility time is prior to the time/date you normally start your monthly.  You willo be busy enough taking care of two toddler/children and a newborn, and your husband/significant other during the day--and night--and sex will seem like something else you have to do, instead of the relaxing and pleasurable event it should be.  WAIT until the doctor says, "Go for it!"|`|7b660ecad20b306740979133ad6e6c57aa	you wait 6 weeks to allow your body to HEAL.  You've had a ton of things happen during the birth process and it takes a while for the body to get back into shape.  You can do other things besides intercourse...|`|fMiLQnSJaa	there must be a reason why doctors recommend that.|`|1708202e3be570491d625333bfa130d4aa	yes it is something you should talk about with your doctor
wlAmUQe3aa	It depends on baby, I'm afraid. Some drop quite soon and stay there, others drop then change their mind a few times. It's more likely that baby won't drop or become fixed until quite late in your pregnancy if it's your first (your pelvis changes shape after your first first baby making it easier for subsequent babies to find the right place to drop).    Good ways to encourage baby to drop are lots of walking and going up and down stairs (especially sideways), swaying your hips side to side while standing up, squatting, sitting forward or kneeling on all fours.     Once baby does drop, your bump will look a bit lower down and you should find it a little easier to breathe.|`|rnTNu6MTaa	Well stating at 32 the baby can drop anytime. I am 36 and she drooped already. But some women say they're baby drooped when they delivered. So don't worry you will be ok !!!
uJ9waJDYaa	Oh my goodness! I CAN NOT believe that at all~  that's soo stupid  That is complete invasion of Personal OUT OF SCHOOL privacy  DO NOT give them ANY of your msn conversations,  you or get your guardian to tell them, that if they want to know things  that have been said, they ASK you, they DO NOT go through  phone calls, messaging, emails, or anything without asking you  or if its something serious, like if kids within the school were talking about  planning to terrorise another student or burn the school or vandalise   school property, they have no right.  Im sorry but that is just insane they would do that,   please don't give in to them and just do what they ask  even if it feels like it will make thiings go away, becos they shouldn't  get away with doing this, its absolutely stupid!     If my school had done that i would be so angry, and i would be telling them   and getting my mum to tell them to f ck the hell off ( not like that of course) but really they have no right to go through private out of school business conversations, if it is of any threat to the school then I'd understand but really, if its things between students, and more or less things going out in their lives and not in all in the school, then thats for the parents and the students to work out,  not for teachers to pry|`|3oGRNQKyaa	no way !  if there were any threats(both verbal and physical) then the school calls the police and the police can do that.    a teacher can not do that,they need to get their priorities straight and msn convos are also private and without both ppl's allowance no1 is allowed to look at them,privacy.    p.s with a fone u can make a story up,but with msn it sometimes makes the person look more suspicious if u say u cant..  unless there is something really sensitive there then go ahead and give them what they want..|`|LUg9dgb5aa	Wow,  i didnt know that.  Its like isnt that private ?  But sometimes they need to find  out the truth , so i guess. But, i  dont really like that , and its still wrong.  i mean i know i wouldnt like   anyone reading my texts ,  not that i have much to hide ,   BUT STILL, its a matter of PRIVACY.  haaha.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	no they can not to my knowledge|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	If they can read notes when you pass them, they can read your texts.    If it disrupts the learning environment, then it has a lot to do with school.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	When it is done on school property, staff do have the right to take the phone.|`|Jucak0HLaa	They can at mine.They go through,see who you were talking to,and if it's someone from school they get in trouble too.|`|QBeVdPBNaa	My friend's phone got taken away last year and the vice principal looked at all of his text messages and he also got onto people's myspaces!   I don't think they can do that that is personal privacy and I suggest they're parents talk to the teacher.|`|zwe9MHqGaa	it depends on the school.  if you go to a public school and you gave reason to believe that there was important information that could harm you or someone else in your text messages or msn conversations then yes if you gave no reason to believe there was a problem then no  if you go to a private school they can look at whatever they want because they arent funded by tsx dollars|`|kmRIKbzpaa	Umm, no. They cannot look at your text messages.    Technicially, they cannot even take your phone - HOWEVER - they can create any rule they like, so if the rule is "We will take your cell phone if you bring it to class" the consequence of going against this rule, is that you have to leave the school.    Looking at your text messages though? That's totally illegal, invasion of privacy, you could REALLY cause a S***storm for that teacher if you felt like it.    Does the teacher deserve that though? Maybe you were also doing something you shouldn't have.|`|yYOh0DUjaa	No, they can't do that. You should probably tell your parents or the principal.|`|oKZ3GstXaa	idk but i know when my friend got caught selling drugs they looked through everything, they tryed to break into his itouch and everything, i think they are alowed to if the have a reason to not just b/c|`|iqWRMcNvaa	Unfortunately, they probably can. Someone I heard about got their phone taken, and then they found naked pics of his girlfriend and he is now arrested as a "child pornographer". School has no business, it's become less about school and more about controlling lives.|`|r8D4JHZBaa	well i don't know about the UK but i live in the US in NY and a few years ago these kids in my class were texting and they wrote really innapropriate things about the teachers like sexual things and my teacher read them but then they didn't get in trouble because it was illeagal for her to look at their texts|`|UFo1Fnqcaa	i dont think they can do that|`|k7htx3iMaa	wow. id think there aloud to do that. but last year my teacher found someone texting (we wernt even aloud to have phones) and they took it and kept it in the principles office and the principle looked at all her texts and opened them up. haha they were all from her boyfriend too, its kinda funny now.|`|CBmuPnK6aa	theyre not supposed to, its kinda personal,  but one did it to my friend yesterday.|`|AA11927081	somehow i don't think they're allowed to do that...there has to be some kind of privacy issue there..but in my school they take your phone and the 2nd time you have it, they take it to our board of education and you don't get it til june..soo i donno. plus you live in the UK, so i don't know what kind of laws/rules they have there.
5nTMliTJaa	I don't think that it is something women TRY to do. Usually the pregnancy is an accident, or the dad left, or the dad is in jail etc.|`|H8sdDM60aa	I am a single mother to a 4 year old little girl..  The cons is money..  Financially, everything is on you.  The pros, me and my daughter are SOOOO close because it is just the two of us and we do everything that way..  She seems a lot happier.  If a mother is in a bad relationship as I was, it does affect children.  I didn't realize it until the relationship had ended, but my daughter is so much happier now|`|urrmckQBaa	I was a single mother I already had my 2 daughters then got pregnant with my son. It was hard work but it was worth it. The pros? you bring your baby up how you want with no-one saying "dont do that"  etc the cons, you can get lonely and feel like your life is a constant battle with dirty nappies and feeds. You often get help from friends and family but it can feel your a little trapped sometimes.     Thats all i can say i suppose, as long as you have a support group then you will be fine, if you dont there are always parent and baby groups etc|`|3217a4e08b15308fee1f8e9a65480626aa	Well I have done both, and I think single motherhood is easier.  As long as you can handle it!  I am married to the father of my two daughters now, and the bonuses are that I get to stay home with them, I can run out to the store when I need too, and I have someone to tell all the cute things they did everyday who will appreciate it just as much as me.    Now, being a single mom, everything is your way.  If your child doesn't like your rules too bad!  THey can't go running to daddy.  Also there isn't another parent there telling you that they don't agree with what you are doing, and there are a lot of things my husband does that I wouldn't do.  I also found that I had more babysitters when I was a single mom, because if I wanted to go out I needed to have one.  Right now, my husband is home, so we don't have anyone on call.
aGORltJPaa	Firstly, u need to calm down.  Take deep breath and try not to let anyone or anything get you down.<br>  Try not to get too stressed as that can be harmful to the baby and can cause problems with the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Its wrong for your husband and in laws to be arguing with you at this crucial stage of your pregnancy.<br>  Everyone should be pitching in and helping you.<br>  <br>  Its even more stressful being pregnant whilse moving house and especially when things arent great on the financial side of things.<br>  <br>  Try to concentrate on YOURSELF for now!  Forget being the perfect wife and daughter in law- your pregnancy and your mental health is more important right now.<br>  Try to solve the more important things first like, who attending the birth with you?  Have you packed your hospital bag?  Have you planned any sleeping arrangements for your baby when it arrives?<br>  <br>  Being pregnant is a stressful time for us.  Our bodies are working much harder to keep up, the physical weight of being pregnant, being paranoid, being snappy.<br>  I had the same problems too but I learnt to ignore annoying people and rise above it!<br>  <br>  Is there anyone else you can talk to?  A sister? Friend?<br>  It doesnt even have to be someone whos been pregnant because sometimes it helps to talk and let it all out...<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest that you sort out your MAJOR problems FIRST because things will get alot harder AFTER you've had the baby! (trust me!).<br>  <br>  I really feel for you.  I was in the same situation as you but I confided in my husband and things got better.<br>  <br>  Hope my advice has helped!<br>  <br>  (Gratulations on your pregnancy and hope your birth goes well!) x|`|4JgSq2rlaa	REALLY THEY SHOULD KNOW BETTER BELIEVE ME PEOPLE CAN BE SO CARELESS WHEN U REALLY NEED THEM U NEED TO BE LOOKED AFTER I FEEL SORRY 4U <br>  <br>  EMAIL ME ANYTIME IF U NEED ANY EXTRA SUPPORT TAKE CARE OF URSELF AND BABY BOY|`|9tC8zz5Zaa	FORGET EVERYTHING!!<br>  you and you husband and his family should be looking forward to the new arrival. stop worrying about everything else and concentrate on your new baby. you can pick other things up after you have had the child and have settled down. <br>  if you need someone to talk to, tell your husband, he should be with you in this special time in both of your lives if not him a friend or your family. just concentrate on the new baby and just forget everything until after the baby is born, there is no way you are going to get a house or anything like that in 5 days, it just WON'T happen as much as you would like it to. you should be happy and looking forward to your new baby not getting stressed out!<br>  good luck!! and congrats!!!<br>  xxx|`|MDfleEXWaa	Hi, i understand what your going through im also going through more or less the same situation. People say its because of the hormones raising and mood swings well im not negating it i agree it could be a but as well i feel the people around us should also care and understand what we are going through at same time instead of calming situation they aggravate it making matters worse. Im in my 26th week and i had tough time with my inlaws too due o which regular arguments with my hubby and he getting mad at me landed me sweating profusely and my blood pressure rising it freaked me all the more thinking how the baby is but was relieved after my scan n regular routine check ups then i thought to myself people are not going to understand my feeling so i started being brave at times i hurts i cry a lot then i think of my lil one in me and think of moments which brought a smile on my face it would relax a lot and you can feel the tension reducing. Just think of your well being and the baby's now dont let anything bother you. 5 days more you will have your lil one anticipate those moments i know it could be tough i just take everything to the LORD in prayer. Don worry you will ave a smooth delivery and a very healthy baby. Let me know how your labor went :)|`|SflneyGEaa	Explain how you feel to your mother-in-law. She's, obviously, had a child and knows what stress can be like while pregnant. You might be surprised how helpful she'll be when she realizes how hard you're trying. Also, talk to your husband. He may be busy but baby comes first. Ask for help. You shouldn't have to take on so much when you're so close to delivery.|`|Dxlt3jcqaa	When I get so that I feel so stressed and upset I can't think straight let alone talk straight I find the best method is to write everything down. Then you can read it and check that everything sounds like you want it to, nothing is stupid and you're not over reacting about it. If I was you I would write down everything you're feeling to show you're husband. He needs to know whats going on and you need to be pulling togeather with you're baby arriving soon not pushing each other away. If I was you i'd start with alot of the stuff you've written here, write down anything else you feel you need to get off your chest and read it through. Change anything you want to then leave it for half and hour. After half an hour read it again and make sure you're still happy with it then ask you're husband to read it. Hope this helps. xx|`|OtMP9g9Daa	I sympathise with you. My wife is also pregnant and due in 3weeks. You must understand that your health comes first no matter what anyone says or does. You MUST forget every other thing for the moment and concentrate on having the baby. You MUST try to relax. take a walk in the park or shopping centre, breath the fresh air or you can go to friend's place or your parent's if they are living close by.<br>  <br>  Avoid getting upset and for the moment stir clear of all arguments.Try taking long warm baths and soak yourself while reading a book.<br>  <br>  MOST OF ALL, REMEMBER - If anything happens to you or the baby. the world moves on. So please relax, breath and don't think too much.<br>  <br>  Take care and God Bless|`|SFMwVJojaa	At least you know what it is that is causing you to worry and you're not just feeling miserable for no reason. Pregnancy is hard - i've got 4! But at least you have somewhere to stay. Try to think positively, think about the summer when you'll be an established mum! If your in-laws give you 'helpful' advice after the baby, just pretend its useful, or that the health visitor has told you otherwise!<br>  Good luck! <br>  Being stresses wont cause long term damage to baby, but obviously being relaxed is better, what about a bath with candles? You could always go to your local library just to read paper if you need a change of scenery!|`|oHpLeYQ2aa	There is not a single woman who has ever been pregnant that did not feel as though she was losing her mind at some point, or had no control over her emotions sometimes, or that the stress of it all was going to cause her and her baby to just spontaneously combust at any moment. That being said, just because something is "normal" does not make it any easier to deal with-- you're still feeling that way! Just keep in mind that your baby will be FINE and I know that's probably the most worrisome part.<br>  <br>  Just breathe. It will pass. It always does. Your baby will be born-- very, very soon-- and you will be lost in being a mommy, in a good way. Keep an eye out for PPD and enjoy your new baby (and kudos to you to being able to live with inlaws for any length of time without being sent up on homicide charges! I couldn't do it).|`|sBHhnDwaaa	My entire pregnancy was stressful. I moved home at 8 weeks (single, by the way), the father COMPLETELY left at 21 weeks, I was trying to do too much in a house with 3 other adults (I was basically doing everything) and trying to figure out how to get everything I needed and what I needed and so on... Plus a full load of college courses.<br>  <br>  Plus I had a subchorionic bleed until 28 weeks, severe swelling (no protein either) and gained too much weight, even though I ate the right amounts and foods.<br>  <br>  I have a perfectly healthy 19 day old now. He WAS 3 weeks early, but my family rarely makes it to the due date lol.<br>  <br>  I loved my epsom salt soaks.... And frozen yogurt or ice cream.|`|AA11682444	Pregnancy brings out the worry in all of us. And for good reason: You're growing a life inside of you.<br>  <br>  It's natural to fret about what you feel, and do. It's also perfectly normal to worry about whether your baby is healthy, how this new person will change your life and relationships, and whether you're truly up to the task of parenthood. But if your anxiety is becoming all-consuming and regularly interferes with your day-to-day functioning, it's time to find a better way to deal with it.<br>  <br>  To start, gently share your fears with your husband — even if they're about him. Chances are he's harboring concerns of his own.and must be stressed with Uni, Communicating openly about your anxiety can help you both feel better. Turn to friends or family members for support, too. Other moms-to-be are another source of support, as they're probably experiencing the same worries you are. Also talk to your mother in law! She cant be interfering and hurting you.<br>  <br>  Here are a few ways to manage your stress and reduce anxiety at work and at home:<br>  <br>  ?  Say "no." Now's as good a time as any to get rid of the notion that you can do it all. You can't, so learn to let your superwoman ideals go. Make slowing down a priority, and get used to the idea of asking your friends and loved ones for help.<br>  <br>  ?  Cut back on chores — and use that time to put your feet up, nap, or read a book.<br>  <br>  ?  Try deep-breathing exercises, yoga, <br>  <br>  ?  Do your best to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet so you have the physical and emotional energy you need.<br>  <br>  ?  Go to bed early. Your body is working overtime to nourish your growing baby and needs all the sleep it can get.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. sorry for blapping on! good luck with the next for days. Will say a prayer for you xxx

tmh42R6Caa	My 17 month old still does this a bit, but I've noticed that he's more interested in his food if I give him a fork.  He's not too good at it yet, but he's working on it.  If he's not showing interest in bites of meat I put on his tray for him to pick up, I'll give him a fork.  Now all of a sudden it's food AND it's a game.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Good luck, try giving smaller portions like a tablespoon of each item at first and if then he wants more give more. I had the same issue with my girls too and it just took time for them to grow out of it and get use to useing silverwear.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Don't make a big deal and don't pick it up while he is in his chair. Just don't look at him when he is doing that. He thinks it's a game|`|qYbFMRcUaa	both of my kids did it too. i had them help me clean it up and they stopped doing it pretty quickly.|`|kkipAB1daa	have him clean it up himself, all of it,, even if it takes a while, stay with him the whole time and guide him on how it needs to be done, then just touch up after him. next time he throws something make him pick it up right away, usually after the second or third time he should stop.|`|FfGHHhqBaa	my 16 month old still does it, not to bad tho, once i gave her a fork she only started throwing food when she is done, oh and i have a dog that cleans up for me lol, she wont do fruit tho...|`|paHbLR9aaa	Good luck.  My daughter is 21 months, and it hasn't stopped, yet.  I slap her hands and tell her 'no', she does it again while she says 'no'.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Sorry I can't help.

H0fXySX9aa	its through your tummy just above your pubic bone its hand held and sound waves pick up the heart beat|`|uuHPneEcaa	it looks like a lil microphone connected to a lil speaker. and they put the lil jelly stuff on ur belly and thats pretty much all it is.|`|z74wSbQoaa	It will be like a little microphone with a rolly ball top.  The doc. may use a bit of gel, so it rolls smoothly.  They will listen from the outside, through the abdomen.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	Check out this picture: <a href="http://www.bellybeats.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellybeats.com/</a><br>  <br>  Basically, they squirt your belly with a little gel, then rub this little handle over it. It's very gentle. The first time you hear the sounds that come out of the machine, it sounded to me like it was a muffled storm. However, the doctor or nurse knows what the heartbeat sounds like in the midst of all the other sounds your tummy and intestines make. You'll hear it very clearly when they point it out to you. <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|98WKYtfwaa	This is what it looks like, <a href="http://www.aurorabioscience.com.au/images/summit_doppler_no_display.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.aurorabioscience.com.au/image...</a><br>  <br>  They put some gel on the transducer (wand part) and place it on your lower tummy, just above the pelvic bone as if you were getting an ultrasound, then they move it around till they find the heartbeat. Sometimes it's harder to pick up at 12weeks but they should be able too.<br>  <br>  It's just like getting an ultrasound but without the big screen to be honest.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	Its much like them listening to your heartbeat with a stethoscope. Only it  is  much more amplified. Nothing will go into you, it sits on your belly and the doctor hold onto the part with a speaker which is how you will hear that wonderful thud thud thud!!<br>  Good luck.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	They will probably try to do a regular ultrasound (on top of your stomach) first, but may switch to the transvaginal (inside your vagina) but they'll more than likely just do the regular ultrasound.. They'll put cold (sometimes they warm it) gel on your stomach, rub the ultrasound wand all over and look at the baby.  Good luck!|`|LBg4DNpCaa	Its nothing they stick in you. They just put a thing that is kinda like a stethoscope but special to hear the baby's heartbeat on your belly with some gel. I hope that makes sense. Good Luck and congrats!|`|h5cFkP35aa	they will simply rub the doppler across your belly like they do at an ultrasound. if they are doing an ultrasound, they might do it vaginally if your very early in the pregnancy.|`|dR2bqUixaa	It's on the outside. At 12 weeks they couldn't find my babys heart beat so they did an ultrasound and there my baby was just kicking and waving!  Good luck!
qisy7yuSaa	I'm Due the same date as you (august 11th) and im going to a private ultrasound clinic called babybond, next tuesday (the 3rd of march) i'll be 17weeks then and we are going to find out! they do the ultrasounds from 16weeks and if the baby isnt in a co-operative position, they ask you to have a short walk, and if that doesnt work they will see you another day for free!<br>  <br>  we cant wait to find out, as we've already picked names, and i cant wait to start shopping! xx|`|s1utniuvaa	My due date is August 11th too! I went Monday and one baby looks like maybe a boy and the other was hiding the goodies... I go for my 20 wk scan on March 25th. I can't wait to find out!|`|C8E3fe3xaa	i'm 25 weeks now, i  found out i am having a boy when i was 18 weeks. Good luck! :)|`|XVljoYZ5aa	I want to know, I'm very curious! BUT daddy is patient and he thinks we can wait it out. I still don't know if I'll be able to resist the temptation when the technician asks, "Would you like to know the sex?" I would love to know, but I think its better suspense for grandparents, aunts, and friends to keep it a suprise.|`|EJ8iS9R4aa	i found out when i was 5mons pregnant : )<br>  <br>  Good Luck with labor  : )|`|lZO3kfoyaa	I found out at 20 weeks and i am 24 weeks right now :)|`|WJF8LNm4aa	I couldn't wait to find out either...LOL!<br>  <br>  I scheduled a private ultrasound and found out when I was 16 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  I am now going on 33 weeks and expecting a little boy : )<br>  <br>  Good Luck with everything!|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	I found out at 21 weeks.

I wouldn't be to excited about that either...but they can name their dog whatever they want, just as I can name my children whatever I want.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I do not like the name Riley because of this. I had a male black lab growing up named Ryely and now people name their daughters this. I think it is just a masculine name that fits a dog, not a little girl. I now have a cat named Bella. But Bella is a normal name / nickname for girls. I would never name my children Ryely or Bella. I feel like it is a one shot deal, you can only use the name once then you have to think of another one. <br>  <br>  I have a neighbor who has had 3 Australian Shepard all named Cramer. I dont know why he does it.|`|pCxM717naa	Nah wouldnt bother me at all.<br>  I had a kitten named Molly, and I love that name loads so if I have another baby girl in the future I'd like to name her Molly!<br>  <br>  My mums pets are called bobby, rosie, toby, sirius and chloe, any of which could be a childs name so it could happen easily for an animal to be named the same as a child.|`|AA11348933	My dog's name is Anna.  While I don't know anyone with that name I hope that they aren't to terribly offended by it.  Why is it any of their business what I name my dog?  BTW, my dog is 9 years old.<br>  <br>  I myself was supposed to be named Heidi.  It was a family name.  My parents liked the name so much they named their puppy Heidi before I was born.  So I got named Heather instead.  The dog died when I was a baby.  My little brother was supposed to be a Heidi too.  Since he was a boy he didn't get the name.  My cousin who is 16 years younger than me is named Heidi.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	people can name their pets whatever they want. I have a dog named K.C. and my brother and his wife named theirs Chloe. No reason to be upset about it, if someone did that i would just make a joke and try and forget it.

4BdFfeLpaa	Ordinary stock cubes such as OXO contain way too much salt than what is recommended for a baby to have. Boots sell stock cubes called Baby Organic Stock Cubes that are designed for use when weaning your baby. I haven't tried them but they come in the usual flavours and would be a much safer option|`|irP2yTMWaa	no you can get baby stock cube from boot i have them and add anything later for me an hubby|`|1J60LVWMaa	No too much salt for a baby's kidneys. Plain stuff only I'd say.|`|VT8L1G2Eaa	Not to eat, maybe to play with!|`|6f54cfe561a33f4d3976270a0c53628caa	i'd rinse the chunks off, a bit too much salt|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think it will be okay I just wouldn't give them a whole lot of it, but a little bit of it should be fine.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	There's too much salt.  You can buy stock cubes suitable for babies from Boots.  And I bought a sachet of veg stock suitable for babies from Tesco, Heinz make it.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	If you're all eating the stew and you don't add salt then it should be fine.  I wouldn't be giving it to baby everyday but once in a while wont hurt.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to use oxo you can get baby stock in boots (UK) and they work just the same.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	OXO has too much salt for a baby.|`|YAWkCPqYaa	far to much salt content in oxo|`|fZgoUty4aa	to strong for a baby i think ..what about take a bit out for your baby when cooked then add for yours..or uses bisto|`|TDVIb4SBaa	So long as it was not to rich I see no  problem,just remember oxo is high in salt ,sounds as though your baby is doing well,I would lower the potato intake as well the vegs alone are excellent.When mine were small I often just mashed up carrots parsnips any veg actually mixed it with a tiny bit butter and the children loved it,remember babies have a more acute sense of taste than we adults so he/she will get the full flavour of food.Pasta is another good choice with a homemade sauce and veg,if giving cheese hold off for a few months let their tummy get accustomed to the different foods as some are high in fat although healthy in other ways.|`|mnn8hYbtaa	I used to cook lots of veg for my son and puree it. He loved it as it was. I never gave him oxo because of the salt content. Your daughter wont miss what she's never had. Just the veg on its own will be fine.|`|QCVzUC1baa	No i wouldnt but i know you can buy ones for babies in places like boots that are low in salt.|`|ltfeYdr5aa	You eat it in moderation so can your little one.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	They sell specialist stock cubes for babies, I have some vegetable ones. They're from boots.|`|IngripgMaa	I think the salt content would be way too high.|`|3fYRi1y4aa	I dont see why it would be.

Yes. Have I been frustrated and confused and sick of things in my life? Most definitely. But I have not been depressed.<br>  <br>  People use the term depressed very loosely.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	I think everyone in their life has been depressed at some point in their life.For one reason or another, either it being an emotional,mental, financial, physical, or a social situation....Sometimes, believe it or not, being depressed can make you stronger. You have to discipline yourself and pull yourself out of what is bothering you. If not or your problems seem too overwhelming and you have chronic/lasting depression, you obviously need help to overcome your depression, either through therapy or medicine or both.  (if it is a seritonin deficiency, it can be treated with meds.) Millions of people suffer from depression, and leave it untreated and therefore, have a a very poor quality of life. There is NO longer a stigma about seeking help or using meds to correct it...all you have to do is turn on your TV set and see all the advertising for different treatments for it.|`|fyyfPEemaa	YEah i have been.<br>  I was ten years old.<br>  I don't know i was like thinking about death and stuff. It was really bad, people thought it was cuz of surgery. I had my tonsils taken about and people thought, it was because of the sleeeping gas .. i don't know . All i know is that i was too young to be depressed. <br>  <br>  yeah i did, i had to go to the therapist and she didn't really help me get over it .. but she did help me forget about it. So. i guess that was a good thing?|`|o4IcmkwLaa	Yes, at 15 after losing loved ones. I went to grief counseling classes at church, started exercising more (it makes you feel SO much better), took St Johns Wort (natural supplement) and started painting and writing for cathartic relief. <br>  <br>  You will be okay. ((((hugs)))))|`|iZk9jEBpaa	Yes, i was 12 when i went through a major episode of depression, i'm 13 now and still go through periods of depression.|`|wIayNrbhaa	I have been depressed before. It was during my jr high years. I had really low self-esteem and figured that no one loved me, everyone was better than me, and that life would be better with out me. Of course...there were outside influences too like rejection, ugly opinions on my looks, jealousy all that crap. I was depressed between the years of 15-17. It was god awful. But then i realized how much i was hurting the people who loved me because i didn't value myself like they did. I soon learned that everyone is not going to like you, everyone has opinions, you can't always be perfect and need to get over making mistakes, and that i needed to stand up for myself to gain respect. in summary i needed to put on my big girl undies and leave the past where it be.|`|5RwKStuTaa	At around age 15.<br>  <br>  A horrible break up and family problems... my mother was an addict and I was so stressed all the time over bills that I shouldn't have had to worry about, if I was going to have food to eat, how I was going to walk to school in the freezing rain, who was going to look after my little brother, etc..  Luckily, my older sister was a lifesaver and I moved in with her.  It was tough switching high schools, but a year later, I was so much happier and less stressed and did a lot better in school.|`|XBUa3Kniaa	When I was 16 I was very depressed im 18 now and I still hurt but no more depression. The reason was because I got taken away from my mom because she was a drug addict. I got over it by doing things that made me happy. I also went to councling which i didn't like at first but it helps having someone to talk to and that you know you can trust.|`|y8p5GHaZaa	Yes, when I was in high school.  I just had no confidence and not very many friends and I was unhappy.  I saw a therapist which helped a bit but it really just took time to get over it.

A person who had Diabetes doesn't just "get over it," Depression is no different.<br>  <br>  Some people need medication for a bit, some people need it for longer. Some people need to talk to someone (like a shrink). Treatment is different for everyone. <br>  <br>  You first step should be telling your parents (or a teacher or trusted adult) about your feelings, and then a Doctor's visit should follow. Good luck!|`|ztxW3zlqaa	Yea. It all started for me when I was in 9th grade. I just entered HS & everything was so new. My little town school was integrated with another schools HS cause we didnt have one, so It was hard for me to make new friends. I didnt have much friends in the first place. I got depressed cause of all the lonliness I felt, no guys noticed me, & problems with my image/body/weight. It all ended in 11th grade when I started to make friends & had a great body & started to get more confidence in myself--- but then I moved away to another town far from the few friends I had, so I felt left out by them a lot cause they would always hangout without me, even though I stayed & finished at my HS. That made me fall into a deeper depression. Time has gone by, I'm in college & better now...but I'm scared it will come back again.|`|K32Kpbjeaa	Yes, I have been manic depressive for the past four months.<br>  Well im getting out of it now, <br>  I'm 14 years old and im getting over it because it all happened because me and my boyfriend were fighting, i was being left behind...my friends were leaving me, my family never got off my back about ANYTHING, and everything was just horrible. I didn't like it. I was falling behind in school, as things were getting worse for me, one of my best friends was going through some things too so i had to help her and i shut myself up for weeks to listen to her and help her and one night i just broke down and Ran to my boyfriend for the first time in a while, with tears pouring down my face, and bloodshot eyes and my hair was a mess...and all he said was "alli you're the best thing thats ever happened to me and i want you to forgive me. I love you"<br>  and everything just got simple and beautiful again.|`|2KAqLbqiaa	Yes. Age 13. That was a time in my life where everything went downhill. My grandfather died, my dad was diagnosed with kidney failure, my parents' marriage was on the rocks. And it was an internal thing, for me. I felt like I wasn't good enough. I had bottled up a lot of feelings and there was a lot of self-hatred. And I remember waking up every morning and just wishing I was dead.<br>  <br>  How did I get over it? I went back to church. Got some counseling. People helped me see that I was beautiful and that I was good enough. And I'm grateful for that. :)|`|vLEZ6fFLaa	yes, 14-15 well i'm still 15 but things are looking up.<br>  i just felt like i had nothing to look forward too. just piles of exams, boys were messing me about. and friends *****.<br>  i just carried on, found some amazing friends, they help you with the boy trouble, give you advice, i dressed up nicer so i'm finally noticed, and i just have to stick my head down into my books.<br>  <br>  xo.|`|9vlXaSlbaa	Thank goodness, I've never been depressed.<br>  PLEASE HELP ME;<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225133237AAfwOXz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|q52Z4v6Maa	yes...i'm 14...life itself depresses me and i'm still depressed so i never got over it...hope you can if your also depressed though...|`|CSO6d3Riaa	yes...<br>  teen years...<br>  school....peer pressure...financial problems...<br>  I tried smiling|`|kuNCBosEaa	no|`|GexgmXMJaa	yes when i found out a friend  of mine ....well i can't say it.
Ms8b2kISaa	I suppose it's possible, but unlikely. With most types of BC pills, the last 3-7 pills are either a placebo, or a different type of hormone than the first 21. The first 21 are the important ones, that keep you from getting pregnant, and the last ones are more or less a "space filler", so that there's one pill for each and every day, to help you not to forget any days. I'm currently taking Lo-Ovra (I think I spelled that right! LOL), and in my packs, there's 3 weeks of white pills, and 1 week of peach pills. I almost always start my period on the 1st or 2nd day of that peach week. In "simple" terms, the 1st 3 weeks of pills are making your body think it's already pregnant, therefore making it nearly impossible to actually get pregnant, and the 4th week makes it think that it isn't pregnant, so you get your period, which is the "cleaning out" of all that stuff that was in there, preparing to be the home for a baby. Whew! That was a lot of babbling, huh? Keep up on the rest of your pills, and make sure you get your next period, and I think you should be fine! Good luck!|`|ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people dont want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer|`|g8qHXXxtaa	My girlfriend was exactly the same. <br>  <br>  She had a pregnancy test, came back fine so she went to doctors because of cramps and lower back-ache and found out she had Sustitus (A Urinal Infection).<br>  <br>  Hope i helped.<br>  <br>  x|`|wyAbkG3oaa	Its possible. Even if you miss just one pill and than have sex it is possible to become preganant. Take a test to find out.|`|4njcFBNhaa	If your on the pill that week off isn't a real period. That's why some people find it hard to get pregnant after stopping the pill, waiting for that real period to start again. I can only recommend going to the doctor if its really playing on your mine. Next time be sensible and use a condom not worth the risk of catching an STD!!|`|xKoc55sEaa	There's a chance you might be pregnant. Try taking the pregnancy test just to be sure. Good Luck.|`|Dxlt3jcqaa	Yes if you have missed pills you could be pregnant.|`|1K0n0Sk8aa	you had unprotected sex so yeah its quite possible you could be|`|JehM600kaa	just take a pregnancy test but the chance that u are is tiny|`|uuHPneEcaa	if u have missed ur period then take a test that is the only way u will know for sure if ur pregnant or not.|`|wUQ51VBdaa	ooooppss! lol<br>  <br>  maybe you could honey, only way to tell is a test!<br>  good luck!! :)

AA11116434	My daughter is 2 now, and we are due in 8 months, so they'll be 2 years 8 months apart. I wanted them to be closer in age, but it didn't happen any earlier. My sister and I are 13 months apart (but my mom was 18 and very fertile) and we are best friends. I really want that for my daughter also, but I think even 2 years 8 months is going to be a stretch in their younger years. My obgyn said 1 year was a long enough wait for me to try again, and I am 30 and in very good health/weight. <br>  <br>  Congrats on your new bundle!!! I bet he is just darling! I wanted my 2nd right after I delivered my first, I was sooooo in love! :)|`|eytlIKITaa	A woman's body takes 2 years to recover from a pregnancy.  But you can do whatever you want, really.  There are no rules to how long you need to wait to have another child.  It's more a personal choice than anything else!  Good luck!|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	My first two were 17 months apart, that was too close together, both physically, for me, and it was just difficult.  My second and third were nearly 4 years apart, which was fine - 2 or 3 years is pretty good spacing.|`|u9MWpkvNaa	I'm sorry I'm not a mother (yet) but I do have some humble input. For one, the hormone prolactin (that you produce more of while you are nursing your child) will drastically decrease the likeliness of ovulation if you nurse more than 11-12 times a day.  This an important mechanism to help space out births so the mother has time to spend on her new baby.  If I were you, I would wait two years so your child has you all to him/herself before they lose your attention to the new one.  That's what I would do anyway. Congrats on the new baby. ^_^|`|EEdzRCQKaa	well i have two boys there is 18 months between them they play together all the time but also fight people told me to wait until my first child was at school but i thought it was to long for a child to be on there own|`|ltfeYdr5aa	We conceived our second when our first was 9 mths.

I'd wait at least a year. My son just turned 3 years old & we just got pregnant with #2. It's also harder having babies so close together. Some people can handle it, others can't. It's just a personal decision, so ultimately you do what you want.|`|ghXH7JZRaa	Well I haven't had my second child yet but it closing in on a year since the first and I would have to say that I've felt that baby itch as I see him getting older. But I would say wait until you at least have the other one out of diapers and they are slightly more self sufficient. Just to make things easier on you..|`|GWveqx61aa	my sister waited 8 months with the first one to 2nd one and from 2nd to 3rd only 3 monthe, shes paying for it now, they are too much for her to handle, gotta think about the diapers,, and feedings, id wait at least a year, congrats on your new bundle of joy|`|umdKUxSDaa	well i had a miscarrage, and i'm trying again but i'd say wait at least 2 years. because your body isn't physically ready for a baby again. but whatever you want girl.|`|aJTBF7opaa	Just speak with your doctor, and what there recommendations for the earliest you should conceive. Having children to close to one another can put you and child at risk.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	i think im in labour now and my first son is only 15 months old, i wouldnt have them this close again i would wait a good 15month then get pregnant so the first is at lease 2yrs old|`|s8VY7uReaa	Im TTC but my friend had a baby and soon after she conceived right away. yes i know it was very soon lol. with some women they can conceive right away. where as some women take longer to conceive.|`|AA12150541	I got pregnant with my second when my 1st turned 1 year---there age difference is perfect!  almost 2 years apart---they are the best of buddies.  my third came almost 4 years later and i wish she was closer to my other two.  so if we decide on a fourth we will be trying when this one turns one.<br>  good luck!|`|47f68597748b8362993a581aa0e99a14aa	It takes your body at least 2 years to get back to normal after giving birth.  If you want them closer in age than that 12-18 months apart might work for you.
H0fXySX9aa	if the blood test is negative it could be gas that is making her think its a baby kicking<br>  unless you have had children and felt a kick how could she even think it was a baby kicking|`|b6NYAO3paa	wow are you serious, uhm she should just go to the doctor again....<br>  <br>  a real doctor|`|JQZzI49Paa	YES|`|2RhQ1Lb2aa	the doctor and the tests say that she is not pregnant - so one would have to assume that she is not. Trusting the science. Because if she is - what kind of doctor is it then? So, it is more possible that she s just gained some stomach fat, which i ve noticed in women.|`|F9pAWBG9aa	the weight gain well thats easy she could be eating more her metabolism slowing or something common. the "kicking" could just be gas or her imagination. blood tests are very accurate if she doesn't believe it have her wait a few weeks and take another one|`|x8JRkRNkaa	It sounds to me like she just really wants to be pregnant.

ZNhP3mpUaa	completely normal... all women have vaginal discharge throughout their pregnancies... as you get further a long, it will be more common, and once you hit 37 weeks its considered a warning sign of labor!|`|S4DNQkFraa	You may just have an infection. Do some research to ease your mind until you see your doc. Your stress is the baby's stress. Try to relax and stay calm. G/L!! Congrats!|`|Ms8b2kISaa	Weird discharges are completely normal all throughout your pregnancy. As horribly gross as it sounds, I had colors coming out of there I didn't even know existed while I was pregnant!!! The only thing you want to watch out for is if the discharge is ever pink or red, which may indicate blood, and if any discharge is ever accompanied by pain, like bad menstrual cramps. It's definitely good that you're going to the doc, and I'm sure she can explain everything to you in greater detail, but don't worry! Relax and enjoy being able to sleep! CONGRATS!!!|`|65x0vJNnaa	Your body is gonna do all kinds of weird gross things in the next several months.  My Dr told me as long as it did not smell bad or was bloody it was normal and nothing to worry about.  Good luck.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	*It normal, sometimes gross but normal! Alot of women get more discharge while they are pregnant.|`|ltfeYdr5aa	Totally normal for your discarge and smell to change. If ur really concerned try emergency.|`|QIwQYXovaa	They say discharge is fine unless it has an order or bleeding associated with it.  Please call your ob gyn office and talk to the nurse just to make sure that it is ok, they might want to see you sooner or tell you that it is ok.  It would just make you feel better if you call.|`|FfxgHWGxaa	from experience at this stage in pregnancy im sure that every1 gets this type of discharge. To pt your mind at ease if you r over worried i would nip down to hospital to get a wee check over. stressing out is nt good for you so try and take it easy and c how things progress. good luck|`|h5cFkP35aa	it's normal to have an increase in vaginal discharge during pregnancy. it could also be a kind of yeast infection, which pregnant women are much more prone to. no need to be worried. good luck!|`|858a0632fe3d77a7fe9bf558aaa8a346aa	It's normal as long as there's no odor.  When I was pregnant with my son we called it "butterbritches" in my online group...|`|sIr2fWh6aa	As long as there's no odor, you're fine.  If there's an odor, then you most likely have a UTI.

I hope you are the father and can help this little girl out. I'm afraid I don't have the answer you are looking for.

Good Luck!|`|VOmE0UFsaa	Im not sure at all but i just wanted to comment and say that i think its so awesome that you would want to pursue in finding out*~  Most arent like that*~ Good luck hun i hope all works out*~!!!|`|RcBkUBsfaa	you can!!!<br>  go to the family court house and request a paternity test.|`|1qWyZlG4aa	Check with your revised code books which are available at the library.  You can find these in the reference section by dictionaries and such.  These will tell you if you have any rights at all considering as it is a POSSIBILITY ( and the only reason why I am not GO AHEAD AND DO IT is because I am my fathers daughter, but I look closer in appearance to my uncle, who is sterile.)<br>  <br>  If you can, I would really go for it, and I applaud the fact that you want a better life for her.  You are a rare type of guy indeed!|`|GLiqeAV6aa	Yes, you have a right to do so. When you go to court to apply for it, I suggest being able to accurately recall when you and the woman were in the relationship, around the time when you last had sex, and if you could bring some sort of document proving you were with this woman, it could only help you. The whole process should go smoothly if you are well-prepared. Make sure you have people you can contact to verify your relationship with this woman if the court asks. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Lgr1CxA9aa	First of all hope and pray that the child isn't yours so you can be out of that mess and not have to deal with a skanky female ex and the convict who she named as the father.<br>  <br>  Once a man has been legally named the father, it is going to be almost impossible to take custody of the child unless he gives up his parental rights.<br>  <br>  Not good that the child has to suffer, but she won't be the first or the last, as long as irresponible, selfish people continue to have children.

The premise of the single was also to promote Boost Mobile and has been used as the background music for their advertisements.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	sex|`|UUpsa35Daa	There is no true definition for "hook up". Different people have different definitions...it's the most general, ridiculous phrase. I think hooking up starts at making out or kissing and goes to sex because i think that's where intimate relationships start. My friend's think kissing a bunch of people isn't that big of deal so they don't consider it hooking up...they consider it hooking up starting it hand jobs and oral sex.    There are many definitions. It depends on the person.|`|dPULl5hjaa	sex - idiot|`|2RkDecZwaa	I always say "I hooked up with him/her" if we made out and sometimes it means that we had sex. Depends. Gotta ask the person what they mean I guess. Its different for everyone.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	my opinion: someone or a friend who finds some random person for  YOU and tries to set up a date FOR you.|`|6gthdHpnaa	Hook-up or hook up has several meanings:  Making a connection, especially an electrical connection  An electrical connector  'Meet up.'

ke2SGcZDaa	You shouldn't have stomach pains really. You might feel sick from being stressed but if you have missed your period, there's always a chance. You can get pregnant on your period too so...wait until you miss a period and then test. A doctor would be able to test more efficiently with a urinalysis. I felt very tired and thought I just had the bug at first and finally tested and got a positive result. If you think you're pregnant and you're stressing, that could also affect your period. Stop stressing because the first three months are the most important. :) Hope everything works out the way you want it to and hope this helps!!|`|YqeatZB4aa	My friend has seven false negatives and she was pregnant. I am feeling the same way as you are and wondering the same thing you are...but yeah it is possible.|`|r9lzC5HXaa	generally you know if you are pregnant when you hit yourself with a baseball bat!When you start seeing things and have illusions.I also think i am pregnant but know  because i drink and smoke and do tobacco.my advise is go to the grocery store and stuff your bra with some watermelons.Then you will feel good about yourself and then go lay in the road and say beep-beep.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	are you still getting your periods? There is always a chance of being pregnant if you are having sex. I would say either taking another test or going to see your doctor.|`|JjBwydymaa	test again in a few days ...x|`|2ObqoJbKaa	You could have tested too early. I would test again to find out for sure.|`|9iOHAC41aa	I'm sure you could be. Wait a few more days and test again, see what it says.|`|80c673f290ffd2a76bf4b398c675adbbaa	if you dont get regular periods then i wud test no less than 19 days after the last time you had intercourse and of course you should use the first urine of the day if that is negative then test again in says 2-3weeks after that by then you wud be bout 5wks pregnant and then it wud definately show up
Su0O55W8aa	Stress and paranoia will delay your period most definitely!  Chances are you're just late and since you are having normal period symptoms you will start.  It isn't uncommon to miss a period for some women, if you aren't on birth control that is.  Or if you are and you don't take it like you're supposed to you could also miss one or double up on one!  Try changing pills if that is the case, I had a friend who was like this and it was trial and error for her and different brands.  Otherwise go and purchase a First Response or something like it with a digital read out of PREGNANT or NOT PREGNANT, along with the "with results 5 days sooner".  If you haven't started a period within another week or week and a half just call your gyno and schedule a test and check if needed!      Relax though, and do some relaxation techniques along with getting extra rest!  Or go get a massage even!|`|4GtrHkzsaa	Go to the doctor to get a test done, they will tell you whether you are or not.  They can do it through a blood sample, or urine.  They are generally a lot more accurate than a home test.  It definitely could be stress, I've actually skipped a month because of the stress that I was under at that point.  But seriously go to the doctor and get tested.|`|w58tUfNOaa	It could be stress, it could be because you are still young and your cycle isn't as established yet.    Go to see your dr. so they can do a blood test.    Good luck either way!|`|pUnjP0Jyaa	no one can tell you whats wrong woth you i do suggets however making a doc appt. so you will no for sure you cant depend on answers you get off yahoo their just oppinions and some ppls are harsh and not exactly what you want to hear b/c they dont know wats wrong with you their just sayin wat they think sounds good!
rBVpsoudaa	Yes. And it will hurt even more if you get pregnant and have to give birth. You're too young if you need to ask this.|`|vkNa6Vhwaa	yes, it would hurt for your first and maye be the second time|`|4p9ESShFaa	depends how big his dick is :L:L:L
PLpwgROLaa	I have been doing the Upromise thing for a few years now for my nephew's schooling and it only works if you actually go to those companies and buy something. Like you said your cvs card, credit cards from the stores they have listed, even McDonald's.  It does work. I have over $100 in there. You just have to remember to keep updating credit cards when you get newer ones.|`|iFKuvuGtaa	Upromise is great. Both my kids are on it!
zLoyo24Taa	He will need the things that any typical 14 year old boy will need. He might like to bring things from home with him. Maybe you could let him pick out the things he is going to need. It might be a good bonding activity for the two of you. Good Luck|`|AXshzI0Kaa	What does he like?? Video games, books, art supplies, model cars, etc.....    Toiletires, body wash, shampoo, cologne or body spray, grooming needs- brush, comb, etc. Cool clothes that will help him "be like his peers".     T.V. for his room??    Cool bedding for his room??    Posters for his walls??    Neon lights for his room??    A big ear....yours.     A dose of patience...from you.     Lots of love.....from you.     Good luck and best wishes...I have an almost 14 year old and these are things he would want or ask for. There may be more.|`|2wyDALHgaa	When the time comes I'd ensure I get the same things any other child would need (bed, dresser, lamp, chair and desk perhaps, linen for the bed....).  As for other things, why not set a dollar limit to start with and tell him that you will be going out shopping and he can choose what he would like.  Set the limit so that things don't go nuts and then that still leaves you the freedom to get things later on over time.  It also helps to serve as a bit of bonding time as you guys all show an interest in what he would like and go out together to get it.  It's all going to take time of course but why not use every opportunity you have to grow closer.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Therapy sessions for the entire family.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Everything that would be essential, bed, dresser, desk, then anything a 14 year old boy would love... they love computers, Xbox's, video games, etc.|`|skWN7jWHaa	a bed,dresser,then take him with you for the rest...clothes,bath products etc...and don't forget the love and understanding!|`|DmJFln79aa	I wouldn't go overboard with ALL the things that a 14 year old would want.  It could be money wasted.  Get to know his interests and go from there.    For the basics, go shopping with him, or look through the interenet/catalogs with him to get what he might like, if possible. For example, you wouldn't want to do his room in a sports theme, if he has been bullied by jocks.  Or, try to re-create his life with his mom too closely, or not close enough.  Find out what he wants and what he's comfortable with first.    BTW, I would definitely let him know that he can talk about his mom any time, and in any way he feels in the moment.|`|984c0feac5fcb2b2527360725a42fac5aa	Everything everyone else has said, but also school supplies.  Anyone with kids knows that school supplies can be a major expense.    Also you might find out if they are currently involved or are interested in participating in sports.  I personally think all 14 year olds should do something.  Most sports teams have fees and costs (uniforms, equipment).|`|A0W1ezmbaa	I wouldn't worry so much about the whole tv, gaming system thing yet. Get what he definatly needs such as clothing, bath products soap, toothbrush, shampoo and maybe an electric razor (if needed) I would also make sure he comes along so that he can pick that stuff out he might not like the same toothpaste or shampoo and soap sent.   School supplies is a must a nice calculator, pens, pencils, notebooks erasers, pecil bag, book bag, planner.   I think that its a great thing for all kids to be involved in some extracurricular activity, wether it be a sport (usually have to pay for uniforms etc), band (instrument), art (supplies) or anything else.   Then of course things like bed, dresser, desk.  I don't think that indepen.. was so far off by saying therapy. This will be a HUGE adjustment for all of you and you both (as well as any other children or spouse you may have) may need someone to talk to at least for the 1st year. Most of the time if money is an issue your local pastor is trained or can help you find someone to help with this. My mom passed away when i was 7 and we went to camp Amanda the Panda (they have it for many ages) and it was a HUGE help and nice knowing that i'm not the only one.. and that the feelings inside him are normal.|`|VDWzEw3aaa	tissues. - he will cry his little eyes out.  tampons -he is such a girl.  clothing- who wants to see his bare ***    that is it basically.|`|ykP7I3caaa	I'd buy him the basics  Clothes  School supplies  Bedding  Things to make his room look nice  A dresser    But hold off with the fun things until he earns them with good behavior. Buy him maybe one 'out of your way' fun thing. I wouldn't advise flooding him with everything he wants all at once because he'll feel grateful at first, but then just plain entitled.    EDIT- Definitely something to support a constructive hobby.
PJSSdgf6aa	wow! get a grip hun....ur messing up ur life while hes getting the pleasure.....missed 3 periods? thts a sign of pregancy no doubt....if u can try looking for a planned parenthood place near u they test u for free....good luck! dont make stupid mistakes like that again!|`|X6as2nOAaa	go to a planned parent hood and take one there it is free you need to think before you get drunk at 13 and have sex|`|AA10390690	mature up a bit, stop drinking as that's going to do a lot of damage to your still growing body and tell a trusted adult and get a test done.|`|YhjTbSmDaa	Not to sound rude at all, but why did you drink? Was it to seem more mature? To feel grown-up?    With the positing youre in, the only mature thing to do is be honest with your parents.    Really, dont hide this from your parents.|`|laLW1Krwaa	Well you can start by spelling BOY the right way  and just her she will find out sooner or later so just say it know and at 13 who sells you drinks? o_O|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Tell your mother.  While you didn't knowingly have sex.  You did knowingly do underage drinking.    You need to tell her.|`|bJnNNpZdaa	What has the world come to?

Either way you want to tell her. Because she has to give you the money to buy the test. And if your pregnant she will have to support you and your child. So sorry to say but either way your not grown up. It's better to know this when your young so you can live life up when your young because as soon as you hit adulthood its a totally different story. Trust me you'll see what I'm saying when you get there!|`|CZwFNUoOaa	i think some of these people are being a bit harsh most people have got drunk under age come on remember the first time you got drunk i am not saying its not stupid but everybody makes mistakes      my advise to you is to calm down i doubt your pregnant you would probably have other sings and you don't know for sure if you even had sex if you cant remember your bf probably cant remember much either but you do need to take a test a least to put your mind at There's loads of places you can get one for free walk in centers etc if not ask your bf for the money or really close friend who you can trust or phone a help line they can tell you were to get a free test(click on the link) or just go to your gp he cant tell anybody its confidential     i hope everything goes ok for you xx|`|PbPKSNlLaa	Okay skank youre 13. keep your pants on for one and for two why are you drinking? ask the boy to buy you a pregnancy test bec. it sound like you are.|`|lOuiQm4Saa	how...disturbing, 13? that's disgusting, go see a counselor and change that way you are!|`|49LiABmvaa	we're not human pregnancy tests  if you can't buy one that sucks  there's nothing you can do then  you can't just wake up and know you're pregnant one day    im 14 and pregnant and i've taken responsibility for my actions  you've done it and there's no going back and changing things  you need to man up and do the right thing  if you are pregnant you can't worry about what your mom will think  you might be carrying another human life and you're just ignoring that  you need to be responsible and mature and do what's right|`|EBkGtGjDaa	well go to a planed parent hood clinic    they will test you and you might be able to go without a parent.      you were to young to drink ( did they teach you that in school the legal age is 21) ever heard of pros and cons and cause and effect.      also it can be stress the reason you not having you period|`|yQL5ET4xaa	It's funny how you're saying that you're too young to have sex but then again you're drinking. You're way too young for that too. Be smart and don't do things that are just going to mess your life up. My sister is your age and I would get so upset about something like that. Ask your boyfriend to get you a test cause if you haven't been getting your period then there's something wrong. It could also be cause you're stressing about the whole situation and if not it's better to go to the doctor.|`|1dnAUzIgaa	I posted a similar Q about drinking and not remembering the next day.I'm in college though.dangerous thing to do,trust me.Get out of that bad habit now!You have to tell someone in order to find out if you're pregnant or not.|`|yDYJH2lNaa	If they have a planned parenthood where you live, you can get tested there. But you need to tell your mom.|`|AA11927081	You have to tell her. You thought you were grown up enough to take some shots, now be grown up to admit to the mistake you made.
s8VY7uReaa	yes you may still have the chance as the stretchy mucus might ov not been due to ovulation. Iv had stretchy mucus but when iv took and ovulating test its shown negative. anyways i hope you conceive. baby dust to you
2TrHH0rkaa	Lily is definitely my favourite. Gorgeous name, one of my favourites in fact :)|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I think it depends on what you are going for. Chelsea is a solid name that will work at any age. Lily seems rather trendy to me, but still cute! So I think it depends on what you want to go for :)|`|IOQshyGMaa	Chelsea seems a little tacky to me but Lillian ( or Lili) is a beautiful name and a classic.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Hm..

Not overly keen on the name Chelsea (no offence to anyone who owns this name)<br>  <br>  You could have Lily as short for something. People have suggested Lillian, but there is also Lilidh (which is pronounced Lily). Look it up on a name etymology website if you're interested. I use "www.behind the name.com". There is also Lilith as an option (one of my favourite variations of Lily)<br>  <br>  The name symbolises purity and it derives from the name of the flower.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|aa8d66371ff46d7a821623d9f0e9c6bfaa	Well 1 of my friends is named Chelsea I don't like the name Lilly r Lily no matter howu spell it just don't like it. So I would prefer chelsea even though I'm not fond of that name either.|`|gHWkYOMOaa	Chelsea. Maybe you should spell it Chelsie or Chelsey, since Chelsea is such a common spelling.<br>  In my opinion Chelsea looks like Chel-see-ah like Chelseah|`|2KAqLbqiaa	Lily. It's a sweet little name. Chelsea is too common. I knew five different Chelseas in the eighth grade.|`|HinSwo97aa	lily is more unique<br>  and lillian sounds sophisticated.|`|Wl8tRVWBaa	Definately Lily|`|w9WBxOt9aa	I Love the name Lily but i think it would depend on the last name.|`|b4a7YtTsaa	Lily! :)|`|toTWw4HVaa	Chelsea(:|`|yiEUOwK0aa	Lily :-)|`|YPRfwMLWaa	my sisters name is chelsea|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	LIly or Lilly :o)|`|CxRJwJsraa	Definitely Lily.

E7ViD8EWaa	Aww, I'm sorry. Life sucks when you're PMSing...  If I cut off the top of a frosted cup cake and sent it through the computer, would that make you feel better? I know that you like the tops of cupcakes, and cupcakes make everyone happy! Except Cupcake cakes. They ruin things.    Especially when they look like they were smooshed with a cement truck:  http://cakewrecks.blogspot.com/2008/09/c...    That site always cheers me up! It's all about cakes!

(I can always send a cupcake top!)|`|AA11227706	Awww...I bet everyone has a bad day once in a while.  Being late to school isn't so bad as long as you aren't late every day.  Sorry about you schedule, but you may figure out that you like it later.  And about the C, it's only the end of first sememster, so you can bring your overall year grade up later (just keep up the studying); as long as you tried your best, there's not much more you could have done.    For the rest of that list, I'm sure you will feel better soon.  Just keep up the good work in school!  Oh, and try cutting down on texting; talk to the person instead!  :)|`|Org2hdfUaa	Your last problem is your answer!!     Once a month my life gets like yours!     ;o)    What I do is I let my friends take care of me and make me feel better (it works!). We laugh and have good craic and my problems go away!    Good Luck!     X|`|0PVp8Okoaa	Aww it's okay hon! I guess everyone has their bad days. I think you should remember this day, and try not to make the same mistakes. In order for us to learn and to move forward in life, we must learn from our mistakes and in order to do that we must make mistakes.    I hope you will have a better day tomorrow.  Being late to school it alright, and with your new schedule - you have no control over it, unless you want to see your dean. a C on your math final isn't so bad, there is always room or another chance to improve !    Maybe all you and your friend need is sometime to think ya know? So maybe just let it cool off.    Would you be able to take some of your homework to where you're going?    You owe your parents $270, that's alot. hmm maybe you should do some chores, get a job to return that $270 to them?    Yeah I know what you mean, having the guy you like with his GF in the same class! But sooner or later you  may not like this guy and may become friends with and be better off!!    I hate PMS! kill that PMS by taking some panadol,  and drink something hot and have some rest.    have a good day tomorrow, and try to learn from your mistakes,    all the best :) xo|`|AA10673927	Awww hun. I'm so sorry. You should try talk things out with your friend and explain to your parents what you thought. Just save up money for a while and don't text, as hard as that sounds. See your math teacher about how you can possibly bring up your grade. You'll just have to pull a late nighter this once to finish all your homework. Just try to ignore the guy and his girlfriend for a while. I know it hurts, seeing the one you care for being happy and coupley with someone else, but try to be strong. Eat a banana for your cramps and take some medicine for them as well.  The bad day and week will pass, and everything will turn out fine. Listen to some of your favorite music and eat something yummy. Talk to a close friend. I hope everything turns out well for you!  (:|`|L6acUNBcaa	The thing that helps me most when I'm emotional is talking to someone. Just throwing my emotions out.

I'm sorry!! *hugs*     I know how those days feel,especially with the PMSing. They really suck. All you can do is hope for a better day tomorrow and surround yourself with people who will cheer you up!!!     PS Be happy that the guy you like is in your class!! You got somethin' to look at :D I only see the guy I like at lunch.     PSS We have to do these worksheets in math sometimes that have riddles on them (THEY ARE SOOO STUPID) and this one was like "Did you hear about the guy who tried to kiss his girl friend in the for and mist?" It's so corny, isn't it!

Your parents cell bill is evidence of that.|`|jdVxsK4yaa	i feel th same way. i hav thos days all the tme dat mak me feel lke running away or evn worse. u just got 2 remember dat thers always 2morrow 2 look 4 ward to.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	it is your choice if you want to stay angered up for the rest of the day.     1) not everyone is perfect, we all experience being late for school or work. it HAPPENS to people all the time.  2) yea that happened to me after 3 to 4 weeks of being settled and comfortable from my orginal schedule when i was in the tenth grade. i had no choice but to get use to it, turned out to be for the better.  3) at least you got a C and not a D or F. people always frown on a C, but a C is an acceptable grade. i would give anything to make C's on my past math tests. why freak out over that?  4)if your friend wants to spend all her/his energy being mad at you and he/she isnt telling you why or doesnt have a good reason to be, then why the heck is that YOUR problem?   5)thats what school is, it will follow you home and give you more work to do. if youre tired of homework, do it as soon as possible so you can get it off your chest and relax for the rest of the day, and pass your classes. that way you'll pass to the next level and not FAIL and have MORE homework set up for you next semester. i sometimes do my homework AT school if i have a chance.  6) i really dont understand all this texting crap. i dont get whats so exciting and amazing about a few letters and words popping up every 2 minutes. why not DIAL the number and TALK? talking on the phone is more valuable and worth the money then a few words being transfered to each other's phone.  7)why be mad because  the guy you like and his girlfriend in your class? either ignore them or go sit somewhere else.  8) i CAN understand why you be pissed when PMSing season sneaks up on you. never feels good to go through those days.    but like i said, these things are really little things that youre getting upset over. its not like something major happened....like me.      for the past 2 months i SOMEHOW subscribe to some silly magazines and some company has been stealing nearly 100 bucks from my account. it took ALOT of work and patience to get that straighten out. sometimes i would ALMOST cry about it, but i never did. imagine working your butt off at work for the money you earn and someone just steals a big chunk of that? i changed my credit card TWICE and the company will send me a refund through mail. what i was going through was REALLY something to be upset over, not some petty text message bill (which you CAN control), or a crush on a guy, or being late for school, or having tons of homework. you never realize the petty things you worry about and get mad over until something BIG happens.
52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	I'm thinking on this one... I can't believe that Belle hasn't had a great idea for you. I'll ask around... And get back to you on this. My thinking would be something that is yours personally. Something that "was" yours.<br>  I would like to have something of Belle's. Something of no monetary value but, something personal. Like a handkerchief.. The idea that it was hers is what makes it important.. Something of YOURS is what I'm thinking for your Daughter In Law. Men tend to pass on pocket knives or guns. Women it's usually jewelry.. I'm thinking.... I'll get back to you on this.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my sister husband was in the war in iraq while she gave birth.....her mum in lay made a scrap book of her sonfrom when he was a baby to the very day he went away ie steve 2 hours old.....6 months.....walking, wedding day etc etc each had a gap next to it for a picture of the new family member coming along so she could put in a pic of her baby at 6 month swalking etc. my nephew is now six and the last photo to go in was his first certificate for swimming, his dads was his first medal for boy scouts;) she loves comparing them and its a lovely little keepsake|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	maybe a really nice cedar chest to store the quilt, mementos, baby clothes etc... Like a hope chest. I would love that as a present from my MIL. She could keep it forever and it would prob become a family heirloom|`|sAbah6dTaa	maybe treat her to a spa trip after she has the baby. she would probably enjoy that very much, I would =)|`|QUmsE7xQaa	When I was pregnant with my firstborn, my mother in law gave me my husband's baby book.  She handed it to me with a special card that said "I did the first part of the legwork and you've done wonders with him so far - I can't wait to see what a wonderful mother you'll be to your child".  It made me feel very special knowing she was giving me something that meant so much to her and that had taken years and years of love and devotion. I still sit down and read it and try to find similarities between my son and my husband!|`|3fYRi1y4aa	First of all what a great MIL you are!  My MIL didnt give me anything.  Not to say she isnt a great one.  But what she did do is help out alot with the baby.  I appreciated that more than anything.  Give her the help that she will need without being over bearing.  Go over and wash some dishes or offer to watch the baby for an hour so she can soak in the tub or take a nap.  That would be really helpfull.  Its going to be really hard to be by herself without her husband.  Just let her know that you will be there for her if she needs anything at all.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	My mom gave me a letter when I had my first child it hada story about me and my birth and things that helped her and told me just how special I was to her! I have never recieved anyhing better than that!|`|uzfdgFSxaa	maybe she is practical and need something like a crib, changing table, rocker,etc.  The best thing you could give her is your support and time while your son is away on duty.|`|htfyL6I2aa	Aww how wonderful!  Maybe you could make a scrapbook for her, your son and the baby.  Put together photos of her pregnant, take lots of photos of the new baby.... old family photos... Write her a letter stating all you just said here and put it in the book.  You could get family members to make a page and it would be so special.  A page of how special she is... how strong  she is... how happy you are... you happy you are to be a grandma....etc.  also if you have any mementos from when your son was a baby ( baby spoon, baby blanket, baby gown, etc) maybe you could incorporate that into the book.  You can get a basic scrapbook at any craft store and you could cover it with any fabric (or old baby blanket, clothing, photo collage of the family... family treasures)  Google up scrapbooking, emphera, heirloom, altered art, etc... you can get some great ideas.  You could also do another quilt made up of the same items, like your son's old baby clothes, etc. , and get photos copied onto different pieces of  fabric, letters copied from family members and put on the quilt as well ... google crazy quilt, photo quilt, etc.  Congrats on the new member of the family!|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	1. Scrapbook of family pictures, include both sides of the family, their wedding, etc... and leave a special spot at the end for baby's first picture and the new family's picture.<br>  <br>  2. A book like Chicken Soup for the Mother's Soul or something similar with a meaningful inscription.<br>  <br>  3. Something that you didn't realize would be so important when you had your own first child- chances are she doesn't know about it either. Like; a special pillow, music, bubble bath, massage certificate, camera, etc.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	How about something that meant a lot to you when you were a first time mom. Such as a baby picture frame,a comfy pillow,a nice soothing balm for if she breast feeds.
j2mRop0laa	My kids love to make their salads. Loaded salads. I put the basics in the bowl and then they add broccoli, green peppers, celery, sun flower seeds, croutons, shredded cheese (2 kinds) etc. They put ranch dressing or poppy seed on the actual salad and then with their fingers they pick out the bigger chunks of veggies and eat. <br>  <br>  Make your own Tacos and Pizzas. That's always a hit, too.<br>  <br>  For desserts get some little graham cracker shells and let them fill it with the cream cheese filling and add different fruits on each of them.<br>  <br>  Also, mine like to fix their own smoothies and put sugar free whip cream on top.<br>  <br>  ***Edit*** I asked my 6 year old and she said to use this one:<br>  For Dessert: Take ice cream and let it sit for a few minutes, put cupcake liners in a muffin pan. Spoon the ice cream into the cupcake liners and spread it around. Push candies and sprinkles on top and stick it back in the freezer. <br>  <br>  Also, <br>  take graham crackers and fill them with vanilla yogurt and sprinkle coconut, candies, chocolate kisses on top.<br>  <br>  Those are her favorite from her American Girl Coconut Cookbook.|`|AA10943329	lol love you have a 7 year old sister in law. Does the 3 year old call her Auntie? That would be very cute.<br>  <br>  A great fun food idea is to give them a kids cook book and let them pick one thing each to cook. Shop for the ingredients and let them make it with your help and supervision. Kids love to cook and love to eat their own food. I have a pasta machine and they love to help make spaghetti or lasagna from scratch.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Make home made pizzas you can buy the crust powder in a box ( its blue and white the one we use) put ingredients out and have them make there own pizza.
UXhFcHCHaa	yes bc her body was probably trying to get used to the soy and you switched back so it messed up her belly. did you dr say anything about using a lactose free formula? my son can only use similac sensitve that is a lactose free milk.
g4mvfBQ8aa	Good for you for vaccinating. It is best for babies.  Now for your questions,  a temperature of 100.4 rectally or 99.4 under the arm is usually considered a fever.  If your baby just had shots then the baby could run a low grade fever.  Tylenol is what is usually prescribed since a temp is definitely possible.  Make sure you know how much to give by the MD.  Secondly, irritability is normal but if it is persistent past a day, then I would call if you are concerned.  Lethargy is considered beyond what you deem normal for your baby.  If your baby is sleeping and not eating in conjunction with fever and/or irritability, then I would call the MD.  Keep in mind, you know what your baby's pattern has been and if any of the symptoms they gave you to look for persists, then that's when you are concerned.  Baby will not feel good as expected just like adults do when we get a vaccines.  Hope this helps.|`|AQpjQfmNaa	I have a 3 week old and this past week she had a temp, and was very fussy, and eating alot, and then sleeping for very long periods. I was told that a fever in a baby under 2 months is an emergency situation so I was very scared when her temp was 99.9. The doc said that a fever is considered 100.4 and that if her temp got to that number I should call asap and will prolly have to take her to an urgent care center. They also said that if her temp is below that but I notice her soft spot enlarging (being really red and like inflammed) then to call. Luckily, we watched her very closely, and it didn't go any higher. As far as her being constantly hungry and then sleeping for long periods and then waking up screaming asif she hasn't eaten in days... I was told she was going through a growth spurt and she was sleeping for so long b/c she was growing and babies grow when asleep. <br>  <br>  I don't know about immunizations... I am researching them now, getting ready for the 2 month well-baby checkup, but I waived a few already b/c of side effects. <br>  <br>  Call another pediatrician's office for help if you need it! Good Luck!|`|qayCggxMaa	It can be so hard to tell sometimes with vaccinations.  You are the best judge of whether you think it is the vaccines or something else.  If you really think it's something else, tell your doctor you really want to bring him in to be checked.  It just reminds me of the time my daughter got her MMR shot.  A few hours later she had a temp over 101 and I kept telling daycare and everyone, oh, it's just a reaction to the MMR... then later when the fever went up to 103 and the next day she was lethargic and wouldn't eat I took her back to the doctor.  Turns out she really was sick (although now I can't remember with what exactly - that may have been when she had Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease...).  Anyway, if it doesn't seem too serious right now then give him tylenol on a regular schedule and wait another day - if he doesn't improve at all then take him to the doctor.|`|vjsT8DMIaa	myself personally, I think even a fever of 100.5 is considered a pretty high temp for a 2 month old. As for the lethargy....I would say they are lethargic when their eyes are kinda glassy lookin, they don't focus on you or things like they normally do....and just kinda too tired to even be alert and happy.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Anything above 100.5 is considered high.  Infants aren't supposed to have fevers.  The day after, anything above that you might wanna bring them in.  And if your questioning your child's health, or uncomfortable with something, and your not getting the response you want from your doctor, then bring him to the ER.  He is still so young, and it's better to be safe then sorry.  It's your job to worry.  They should have giving you a leaflet or info pack when you got his shots done.  Read over that, or even google it.  But when ever your second guessing on your child's health you should take them in.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	How high is too high of a temp?  Docs don't get excited unless its 104F but suggest treating with tylenol if it hits 102 and recheck in 1 hour it should come down a bit.<br>  <br>  The crying and fussing is considered a reaction if it lasts more than 3 hours, and is unconsolable.  Usually happens shortly following the vaccines.<br>  <br>  lethargy, not feeding, glassy look in the eyes<br>  <br>  Trust your intuition.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to call off hours if need be.<br>  <br>  Refer to your VIS sheets, vaccine information statements that you should have gotten but studies show that only 79 percent of pediatricians are compliant with this even though its the law.  You can find VIS sheets online.<br>  <br>  Not suprised that you have questions about adverse reactions, the average pediatrician spends only 16 seconds discussing them.
on6dC4A8aa	I totally agree with you---while showing that teen sex has consequences, that show still makes it all look way too easy.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	I just think its a bad show. It is way over the top.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	My question to you is do you really actually watch the show?  In the show they show how hard it is for her to be pregnant. How hard it was for her to tell her parents, to go back to school, not to mention they show you in it now that if you are abused its good to tell somebody right away. They show you that having a baby requires money and care.  So no I don't think it is a bad influence at all.|`|V1hxvQukaa	if parents teach their kids and raise them right, shows like this wouldn't be a problem.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	Shows like that just down play the consequences of sex and make it seem like no big deal. You are so right, many teens don't get support like that at all.    I don't know if it is so much a bad influence as it is a false image.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	No, not at all, because it gives the teens a positive message that pregnancy can create complications in your life.|`|PtfaM7jEaa	i watch that show and i agree with Jenna|`|oKZ3GstXaa	no i dont not think it is a bad influence, i think it is a very good and informational show.  In most cases i dont think that is how it is(the way you said it is)|`|3apfOmLiaa	I agree. This show is giving teens more of a reason to just go out and get it on.|`|CjVXG6r9aa	I totally agree.  I think they need to show it as it is.  babies are expensive and are for life, people don't realise that.  A few of my friends have had kids and they thought it would be great, like an accessory, but now when they see all of us oing out, they realise its hard work.  x    So yes basically i agree, they need to stop showing this side of things.|`|i2yM0T9Paa	I don't think that this show is a bad influence, actually, it is my favorite show.  I have seen every episode and I think that it teaches young girls that they should wait because they aren't ready to handle a baby.     As for some other parts of the show, like Ricky and Adrian always waking up in the same bed after a long night of sex, that shouldn't be watched by young girls.     But Ricky coming out to everyone that his dad sexually abused him and everyone forgiving him is good. It teaches young men and women that no matter what anyone has done to them in that way, its not their fault and they should tell.|`|7tAH3GEBaa	I agree I think a show like that is just that. Its the same as movies with robbery where the robber is supposed to be the good guy. It gives kids an illusion that the consequences don't exist or are not severe|`|XwrjRj52aa	Um, no offense, but do you ever really watch that show? Despite the awful acting, It shows ALL of the negatives of teen pregnancy. It's not meant to show kids its okay, if I were going to make that argument about pop culture glamorizing teen pregnancy, I think a better reference would be Juno.

Not really with the Stacie Elliot and Ryan Bronson... they just dont sound right to me.|`|O71xlcG3aa	I really like Keegan Mitchell for a boy.  I have to say though the girls names are not doing it for me.  I like Charlotte and Elliott but not really in those combinations.
vM0ECvAAaa	Well it depends on whether he likes you or not! I wouldnt just come straight out with "will you go out with me" cos he may just get freaked out. Talk to him. Start it by sayin "have you heard these rumors that we're goin out?" and then talk more bout it by sayin things like imagine if we were! Try find out if he likes someone! Get one of his close friends to find out for you! Someone he'll trust!  Go niridh an-tdh leat!|`|ISKM1z8iaa	Ask him out?|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Ask him out.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Ask him out.|`|QNnRVUoiaa	Ask Him Out.|`|5iMja1Meaa	Talk to him about it :)|`|1k6UUC8qaa	depends what the rumor is how sure you are if they are true you are really not revealing enough infor for a solid advice|`|FJpshSA4aa	Go out with him!
h5cFkP35aa	now that im pregnant, i dream every night! some about the baby, some not. it's very normal and doesnt mean anything. although i did dream about the gender before i knew, and it was a boy. but about the birth defects, i wouldnt worry. :) good luck.|`|MM71EOH6aa	I do too, but I guarantee you have about 10 years on me. I dream about having a baby girl sometimes, it's always the same baby. She has dark hair, green eyes, pale skin. She absolutely gorgeous, I even saw this dream so clearly I saw the name that I signed on the certificate.. It was "Louisa Rose" I didn't catch the last name. It is a dream I will never forget.|`|S4DNQkFraa	Dreams are fears of the subconsciousness. I'm sure all is fine. G/L!!|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	many women dream about their unborn babies. It is totally normal. The fact that she had some birth defects probably just means that you have some worries about this happening in real life. It does NOT mean that your baby has anything wrong with her. The fact that you dreamt that it is a girl may be because your mother's intuition is kicking in and you really are carrying a baby girl. How exciting! <br>  <br>  My husband dreams about playing with our baby boy and I dream about the baby saying mommy, mommy, mommy. Why does he get the fun dreams? LOL<br>  <br>  Good luck1
P1xlrvAaaa	I completely believe you.I think it can vary some are later then others but I think that it isn't impossible.I know as you said other people will think that is crazy but hey only you are in your body and only you know what you are feeling.Good luck and congrats!|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	I was just shy of my 14th week when I started feeling flutters and things i read said that was early too.  I wouldn't trust myself until it had been a couple of weeks and felt them often enough to know, just like you.  I don't think you're crazy!!|`|uuHPneEcaa	it could have been a flutter but only u will know because its inside of u.. So what if ur friends don't believe u.. u really might have felt a lil flutter.|`|AA10315542	I thought the same thing last week.  Only you know for sure.  Mine did it one day, then stopped, so I assume it was gas or muscle twitches, ha.  But, everyone's body is different, you can't deny what you felt!  Good luck to you!|`|LFXTpqfdaa	They don't believe you because fetuses don't have hard bones at 10-11 weeks, so they can't move your uterine wall for you to feel it. But who knows... maybe your surgery sensitized some nerves in that area.|`|bWyKAFwuaa	You know I felt my baby move at 11 weeks, and my husband felt her at 17 weeks...you felt her move....I was 220 pounds also|`|h5cFkP35aa	i felt flutters at 14 weeks, so i dont think youre crazy. it may just be the baby growing, the surgery, or you have a very active baby! if you're worried tell your doctor and they will probably schedule another ultrasound.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I thought I was feeling flutters to around 12 weeks but was told it was gas. It could also be muscle spasms because even after I had my children everyonce in a while I would feel that same "flutter" called my doc cuz I was seriously freaked out and he saaid it was muscle spams! HA!|`|90iP1BCnaa	Only you will know what you feel. I believe you feel flutters already. I felt them at 18 weeks but its hard to tell what the feeling is..
iFAlZfVMaa	a home birth with a practiced midwife is one of the most peaceful, amazing experiences... you are VERY Right... hospitals are for SICK people... birth is not a disease or disorder that needs to be treated... it is a Natural process that has been done AT HOME for thousands of years.. <br>  <br>  in your prenatal care, you will find out if there are any factors that would rule out home birth.  IF a good midwife thinks you are a candidate, go with it... enjoy your birthing experience without being treated like a sick PATIENT...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/homebirthchoice.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/h...</a>|`|z74wSbQoaa	My cousin did twice.  She set up a pool for a water birth in her bedroom.  She didn't have any problems, but sounds like she's a little closer than you to a hospital if there was an emergency.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I think it's great if you are into that. I recommend checking out a hospital just in case because if you have any complications you will have to have your baby there. My cousin had all 3 of her children at home. The first one she had her midwife there adn had to go to the hospital because she began hemorrhagingg, the 2nd her husband delivered and hte midwife showed up right afterwards because she came to fast and the 3rd her husband and daughter delivered because she went so fast! But all 3 babies are beautiful and healthy as can be! Good luck and who cares if you have a 3rd eye! HAHA|`|giyYxbo1aa	I've never had the opportunity although I wanted home-births for my three sons. However, my sister-in-law has got 3 children and all have been home-birthed. It wasn't easy for her because her first two were born premature but my brother has had lots of medical training. Go with what feels natural to you but make sure you are not alone and that you have sufficient support - and that you can trust your birth partner!|`|AA11116434	I was born at home with a midwife, and so was my sister. My mom was prepared and had a midwife there, and she went drug free. She was only 18 and 20 years old respectively, and 5'2 tall. We were both 7 pounders.<br>  <br>  Forward 30 years and I had a 10 pound 3 oz baby and knew from the start I'd want to be at a hospital (even before we knew her weight) and after going through labor, with an epidural, I can say that my mom is a mighty goddess and I don't know how the heck she did it! I do think the epidural caused me and the baby to be too groggy and unreceptive (as a baby without would have been) but we were all okay, and 24 hours after the epi wore off she was nursing like a champ and I only stayed 24 hours total at the hospital. I wanted to go drug free, but with a 10 pounder, I realized I was not prepared for the pain and discomfort of drug free. I still came home with a beautifu girl :) <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|yiEUOwK0aa	no. but i was born at home. :-)<br>  my mum has a friend who is a sweet midwife.

I hope you get your miracle soon!!!|`|GWveqx61aa	preseed is just a lube, i read researched and asked my dr about egg whites and its safe as long as used properly, i used pasturized, dont use the yolk, thats where the bacteria is, this is very similar to preseed, and more cost effective, google it and see theres alot of success stories, sorry i cant help you with the preseed, and good luck and baby dust to all of us|`|vigFmfLmaa	It doesn't aid in conception.  It's just a sperm friendly lubricant (though better quality cervical mucus helps the sperm on their way).  Other lubes kill sperm.  My RE told us to use olive oil.

ESAM0U7xaa	most couples get preggo in the 1st 6 months of trying. after that you may want to get a check up. some may take up to a year. after a year you may want to consider some help. <br>  <br>  good luck if you're trying!|`|Ka52nbhNaa	Just over 2 1/2 years.  We tried on our own for a year and a 1/2 then sought help from a fertility specialist.

My twins are now 6 months old.<br>  <br>  It was a long road but so worth it.|`|FYDw1rjlaa	It just depends...some only a few months or less while others takes a year or longer...as for me, it take me takes me a month or two.

I am on cycle 5 myself, hopefully this is my month!
ZNhP3mpUaa	if there was a serious problem they would have you come in for testing/ultrasound... they don't want to have to use medical malpractice insurance. it's expensive enough... if your amniotic fluid is low, you're not drinking enough water. you should be drinking around a gallon a day. good luck!|`|tmh42R6Caa	I think you're fine.  Doctors would absolutely tell you if there was the slightest chance of a problem.  In my 39th week my OB detected an irregular heart beat in my baby.  She immediately sent me to a neo-natal cardiologist.  I was scared to death!  The cardiologist also didn't sugar coat anything.  He said that if I didn't deliver within 1 week I would need to be induced.  Once the baby was born they checked him again.  He still had the irregular beat.  It's nothing major - fairly common in babies.  However, doctor's do take extra precautions with pregnant women.  Do not get scared!!  If you really want to put this to rest, call back and ask to speak with whichever doctor is covering for yours while he/she is out.  Good luck!!|`|sIr2fWh6aa	If there was something incredibly wrong, your doctor would have called you once he/she saw the ultrasound results.  Don't stress, and just wait until you get your next ultrasound to see.  Here's a link that will help ease your mind and explain a little more about too little amniotice fluid.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_low-amniotic-fluid-oligohydramnios_1199460.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_low-amniotic...</a>|`|FfxgHWGxaa	im sure u r confused and nervous, if i were u i would go down to the maternity unit and demand a second opinion. there is nothing as bad as not knowing. And tough if your doc's outta town its ur baby and you have the rite to no wats going on. good luck and keep me posted!|`|F4FJVq37aa	Im almost certain that if there was a major problem, they would have had you seen by someone else. Try not to worry to much about it.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	first of all, no, your not supposed to be drinking a gallon of water a day!!! my husband did that (obviously not cuz he was pregnant) but was trying to get healthier and it actually diluted his natural salts and he started getting major leg cramps. yep, i thought water helped leg cramps...only if you get them from being dehydrated...sometimes too much water can cuz them. <br>  <br>  anyway, i agree, if there was a serious problem i really doubt they would have you wait 6 weeks to come in. maybe it was a little on the low side, but they must not have thought it was too serious. <br>  <br>  didn't you see the dr. after the ultrasound, didn't he/she bring it up?<br>  <br>  eta: what is up with dr.'s? my dr. waited to look at my ultrasound results - while in the appointment with me! and she just looked at what the ultrasound tech wrote...unless she waited to look at the actual pics "after" the appointment, i don't know if she even EVER looked at them! which i found poor professionalism. with my son, they kept me waiting in the lobby till the dr. had time to review everything and then they called us in and had the appointment.<br>  <br>  i would call back the 'on call' dr. explain that you are really stressed out about your situation and don't feel you can wait another 6 weeks to find out if its serious or not. if they give you a hard time, you need to find another dr. good luck.
EEdzRCQKaa	you could say we will give one last try and see what happened but you could keep going and get boys every time i know how you feel i wanted a girl but had 2 boys then finally got my baby girl good luck|`|WZQKevt8aa	You can't pick the gender of your child, and I think what you're saying is not fair. It is not your husbands fault you had boys, it's not anybody's fault because children are blessings whether they are boys or girls. Be grateful you already have 3 perfectly healthy children, some people don't, others can't have children and others have children that have passed away. Stop being selfish and enjoy the children you've got.|`|AA11116434	3 is a lot. And although you want a girl, it may not be in your cards. My grandmother had FOUR boys. Yes, Four. And she desperately wanted a girl, so she tried a 5th time and got pregnant with TWIN BOYS. My dad is the youngest of 6 boys. <br>  <br>  You can't guarantee a girl, you know that. Would you want another child, or two, if they were boys? If not, I would say, find a friend or a cousin with a girl baby and spoil her with girly clothes- and it will help you "get it out of your system". Plus you can have a relationship with a girl as her mentor lifelong, even if she is your neice or a friend's daughter.<br>  <br>  :)|`|ZvOXs61caa	thats really rude of u to say... given me a daughter. i think u should be thankful for tthe sons you received... for what god gave you. my grandfather had three daughters and ppl would ask him if he was dissapointed he didn't have a son .... and he would say of course not he loved his girls and he meant it.... i think u and your dh should be ashamed of what your saying. what if one of your sons over heard you saying that. i have 4 sisters and no brothers... and if my dad ever said something like what u said about wishing your dh gave u a son i would be devasted .. i honestly don't think i would ever forgive him. a boy is a boy. and a girl is a girl. yeah . but everyone is differen. and if u had a girl as your first child instead of that boy . u would never know him or his personality.... i hope u think about what u have done................. and what does dh stand for anyway! divorced husband! cuz u should deff not have kids with a nonmarried man. who will get custody...anyway u should think about what u have done...|`|gPg7qYGIaa	i can understand how u feel but what happens it u have another boy will u keep trying till u do have a girl maybe thats what your hubby afraid off <br>  i'm trying for my 2nd i love a girl but me and hubby have sat down and said that this is last baby no mater what i get there no more maybe you and hubby could do same thing try once more and no matter if girl or boy u call it a day|`|37dab5663389d7a1f34cbddd0a2bdab0aa	I think you should have said you 'want' more kids, not 'need'. No one 'needs' to have kids. It's something we want and desire. <br>  <br>  I'd be grateful for what you have. I'd LOVE to have three boys, three girls, or any combo for that matter! I'd be so happy!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	wat will happen if u have another boy!!|`|Tk1QJJsZaa	JUST BE HAPPY WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN YOU!!!!|`|DgqjjJqJaa	Just tell him that you want to sit down and talk about it. Talk about all of the pros and cons of having another child. Be very understanding and reasonable. Try to understand his point of view but at the same time make your point of view very clear. Just try to communicate but dont let it start into a fight. Dont play the blame game. Just try to not insult the other. That way you both are more likely to find common ground and no one gets upset or insulted.|`|Btsctjydaa	Daughters ROCK!! Get one. Screw some other guy and get preggo.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Let's get straight on the difference between want and need. You WANT more children, you NEED oxygen. Having more children isn't going to assure that you get the daughter you wanted, you might wind up with twelve boys. Neither you nor your husband have the ability to conciously choose the gender of your children. You need to be thankful for the family God has blessed you with and get a little female chihuahua puppy that you can dress up and coddle. My husband was supposed to be the little darling girl after his parents had two boys; his grandmother actually cried (not in happiness) when he came out, well, a he.|`|rev4lrn0aa	ridiculous... you could just keep having boys you know! It's his choice too so if he doesn't want anymore kids there's not much you can do. You don't really "need" anymore kids... you should be happy with what has been given to you, there are so many people that can't have a baby at all. Stop being silly.<br>  Thank you.|`|H9t63i4Kaa	I completely understand what you are saying, If I had lots of boys, I would want a little girl too so that I can dress her up and do the mother/daughter things, its not fair at all to you...lol...men are so selfish!!!! J/K!!! I wish I knew how you can convince him otherwise, otherthan you already talking to him!|`|vigFmfLmaa	You can't pick which gender you want.  You could have 10 more kids, all boys.  I don't think it's fair for children who have been born the "wrong" gender and know they aren't what their parents wanted.|`|nwHqblWiaa	Im trying to convince my boyfriend of having a child, period--boy or girl it doesn't matter to me-----so if you come up with a way of convincing, please share with me...LOL ;]
jwIdq5qkaa	I think Taylor Lee is adorable and Lillian too! <br>  <br>  Lillian was my gmas name|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I really like both of them.  I'm a huge fan of using family names but even without the family connection they're both nice names.|`|xpUyH0psaa	both name sound really good and have such special meaning.|`|qitXGd0qaa	I like using family names. Lillian Dell is pretty. <br>  <br>  While I like using your maiden name for a boy, but I don't like it as a first name, its a little to unisex for my taste, especially with the middle name of Lee. It'd make a nice middle name though. Maybe Leo Taylor Pierce? Incorporates the Lee and Taylor.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Lillian Dell Pierce is gorgeous!<br>  <br>  I think Lee Taylor Pierce flows better than Taylor Lee. <br>  <br>  BTW I love that you are using family names, it's so nice to see names getting passed on =)|`|JsEd4H0raa	I love them both.

9c6e3f8169b79e67d959162cc83dc7b7aa	You should talk together, with your daughter, her friend, and her friend's mother.  I understand how you don't want to "push the boundaries" of what you can do, but they're only 9.  They're young, and once they realize how to handle these types of situations they won't need you to help as much.  Instead of casually commenting on the issue with the girl's mother, sitting down and discussing the matter, I believe, is your best option.<br>  <br>  Before you meet, talk to your daughter.  Ask her what she feels comfortable saying and what she wants you to say.  Talk about the things her friend has done to hurt her, so you really know what you're talking about.  Then, sit together at your house or theirs, in an open area, like a living room or den.  Don't be too accusing of the friend, just talk openly.  You should start the discussion, since you're the one who called for it.  Just say that lately this friend has been saying or doing hurtful things towards your daughter, and that you feel it needs to stop.  Let the mother talk, and say what she needs to.  Then let the girls talk.  Don't interfere with what they're saying unless they ask you to.  Get them started by saying something like, "Honey, what did she say to hurt you?  How did it make you feel?"  Try to get both of them to openly talk about their feelings on the matter.  Let her know that if she was hurt, it's ok to say she felt hurt.  If she was sad, it's ok to say that.  If her friend didn't realize she was hurting your daughter, let her say that without being critical.<br>  <br>  I think this is the best way to handle the situation, mostly because it's teaching the girls at a young age how to handle disputes.  Don't be nasty back, but be honest and open, and talk about the issue.  Maybe if she ever gets in another little fight (which will inevitably happen), she'll be able to handle it mainly on her own, without her mother's help.  That will be because you were a responsible mother and taught her the right way to handle things like that.  And if things don't work out, and the friendship ends, it's ok.  That friend wasn't worth having if she would hurt you like that.  Tell your daughter this.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I hope I could help!|`|cYFblmpVaa	I think this is a good time to let the kids work it out themselves<br>  don't be so quick to save your little girl, she will surprise you with her true strength.<br>  stay out of it and let her deal with it.<br>  also what is the other mother supposed to do, don't blame her<br>  she is doing you a favor by watching your kid.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	Stop asking a 9 year old what she wants. put her back in the after school program where she'll learn something. Act like her Mother not her friend.|`|sHTaKbexaa	just tell them to stop being mean and get along.|`|4TqUgtpzaa	This is a very tricky situation. I understand your concern, and I feel bad for your daughter, considering the fact that kids can be very brutal to one another. I suggest talking to your daughter, and letting her know that what her "friend" is saying should not be taken to heart, and try to keep her positive. Right now she needs someone to keep her spirits up and to let her know that there is no reason for someone to say mean things to hear.<br>  <br>  Let it ride for another week or so and see how things go. It seems like the change in plans will really effect your day as well, and I think all the moving around of your schedule may be a bit too much. Also, try talking to the girl's mother again, this time pointing out that her daughter is saying these mean things directly to your daughter and that you are concerned about the current plans that you have arranged. Maybe she will finally understand what you are hinting at.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything. I hope it all works out for your daughter!|`|AA11509996	You are right to be cautious about pushing boundaries of what you can do.<br>  Kids at this age are learning to interact and you can only talk to your daughter about what she can do to handle this situation but you cannot try to control other people's kids.<br>  <br>  Try not to make such a big deal about this. Teach your daughter problem solving techniques...Find another friend, ignore her, walk away or have your daughter speak up and let this little girl know that real friends don't act that way. Teach her to speak up for herself.<br>  <br>  Also try speaking to the girls mother again and this time have her FOCUS on what you are saying.  Bring the conversation back to the point you are trying to make and ask her what can be done to make it better. <br>  <br>  She needs to figure this out. But if you come in and swoop her out of an uncomfortable situation how is she supposed to deal with these types of problems should they arise again. <br>  <br>  I don't think altering your whole day and leaving her at home is a good idea.|`|RKTNDLDKaa	Little girls are really catty.    Even at 9, it can be pretty bad.     It only gets worse, though.    Your daughter is probably reluctant to stand up for herself since she is a guest in this girl's home.   <br>  <br>  I would tell the other mom that you are think that the girls need a break, so you are going to enroll her in the after school program again or at a daycare (I know this is less than ideal).     Just tell her that you don't want their friendship to suffer, so you feel that enrolling her in the program will help them appreciate the time they get to spend together in the future.     Tell your daughter that you are making this decision because you feel that it is the best thing and it's really not up for discussion.     The little friend will probably be mad that your daughter is not coming over anymore, so you will be giving your daughter the ability to say "This is what my mom decided, I didn't have any control over it".    <br>  <br>  Is there a high school girl/boy that gets off the bus at the same bus stop as your daughter?   If so, pay him $10 a week to walk your daughter to the grandma's house.    If she's only going home anyway, $10 is pretty easy money to walk someone up to the door of a nearby residence.      Make sure it is understood that she should be walked to the door and waited with her until she gets into the house.    <br>  <br>  I think that after a break, their friendship will resume.   Encourage your daughter to play with other friends at school.    These spats generally blow over on their own.   <br>  <br>  I think you are absolutely doing the right thing.    Be thankful that your daughter trusts you enough and feels secure that she is telling you what is happening with her life.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	The other girl is a brat and it's obviously due to the mother being a blockhead. I wouldn't even bother talking with the mom...parents like that never change and they just have terribly bratty children...they blame their childrens actions on anything other than the child.<br>  <br>  I would try to pick her up as much as possible, and/or hire a p/t babysitter...heck...maybe even ask her if she wants to go back to the part time afterschool program.|`|UtjdtsjYaa	ok this is what i would do. i would invite the family over ( the little mean girl's) and talk about it after dinner while the kids play. talk about how you guys feel as paretns and friends. Then after you guys talk, have the kids come back in and ask them what happen on the bus. and then talk some more, with or with out the kids. and try to resolve this problem|`|NHe6CAWNaa	I think the idea of sitting them down is good, i'm still young (17) but was bullied by friends also around that age and my mum spoke to the school who talked to us separately then together to resolve it. This did help but im not sure if all schools do the same kind of thing, it might be worth writing them a letter or calling them.|`|GLTIGSFWaa	i think you should invite the girl round for dinner and discuss it at the table|`|QIwQYXovaa	I would recommend telling your daughter to talk to her friend herself first.  Ask her to call her instead of talking on the bus and just ask her why is she being so ugly and mean.  Kids usually solve the problems themselves and I do not think you would have to go the distance in leaving her home by herself.  They just need to see what's bothering the other girl.  If the talk with the two friends resolves nothing please talk to the mother again.  Tell her you are concerned and this issue is bothering your daughter a lot.  Parents need to see what's wrong with their kids and not just answer I don't know why she is being so mean lately.  That's just not good enough parenting from their side.|`|Y60GnsFGaa	Well it will only cause stress and emotional issues for your daughter to stay in that enviornment.....however i think that it would be good for her and her friend to solve their problems.....i think that it would be a good idea to do whatever you can to get her outa there. Sometimes when 2 people are around each other for a really long time, they begin to have a shorter string of patience for that person. If she and her friend stop hanging out so much maybe your daughters friend will ease up as time goes on! Goog Luck! =)|`|j7zPa2aUaa	i WOLD TALK TO THE CHILD PARENTS! AND SHOW UR CHILD HOW TO HANDEL THE KID DOING THAT! SHOW HER TO NOT SHE THAT SHE CARES! SHE UR CHILD TO SAY "WOW UR COOL" U CAN PICK ON PEIOPLE ! I WANT TO BE JUST LIKE U ONE DAY AND STUFF LIKE THAT! THEN YOUR CHILD WILL SHOW THAT OTHWER KID THAT SHE DOESNT CAR EABOUT WHAT SHE SAYS! U NEED TO TELL HER THAT SHE IS ONLY TRING TO PUSH HER BUTTONS AND SHES LETTING IT! AND SHE SHOULNDT!!!!|`|G2auAv1Saa	She hated the after school program, so you took her out of it. <br>  Now she doesn't like the current situation, so you want to take her out of it again. You are appeasing her way too much. <br>  She is 9 and on the verge of having to deal with problems herself, she needs to learn now or you will be at college in the dorm rooms solving problems for her.<br>   I understand girls can be sensitive and hormones are starting to take effect, but you can't always be there. Start teaching her not to take things so much to heart and to just over look some things in life. I am sure your daughter has said some things to the other child, which is why she has brought up that her daughter gets upset too. Let her work this out on her own.|`|1hciyvKdaa	The next time you pick your daughter up, have your daughter and her together and call her out on it (in a 9yrs way). Hey are you guys having fun after school and look at her child, so what do you two do all afternoon to have fun, again monitor her childs face. Maybe take those two up for an ice cream and see the interaction, pay attention to your daughter and kinda ignore the other child. It could be, that this new situation to the gal whose house your daughter is staying out, maybe it kinda stresses her out having other kids there every single day after school and shes not able to discuss her feelings with her mom, so she acts out against the other kids. Just because us parents think WE can handle having some kids over after school doesnt mean our own child might not get jealous, over tired and yes nap at that age.  It is a part of life to learn social skills and how to deal with problems, so I dont think the other mom has seen any big flare ups she might be making dinner or reading or somthing. It is much safer to instruct your daughter to sit and quietly read a book instead of play with that girl while at her home. Alone at home is no fun, and is not safe. Kids can have accidents all alone at home and how scary would that be to have noone to help them. Yes bad accidents do happen to even adults who cant get help. Id really try to get this to work out, having her at their home. The little girl whose being mean might just be a creepy kid too, you never know, but at that home your daughter is not alone. I wouldnt make a big deal with the mom who offered kindly to watch your daughter she did it from the heart, so take it easy, calm down, and I bet things will eventually work out. You might also say once a week (on a sunday)drop something off at the other families home for the kids to do thats new, a game or some new books or somthing to keep the kids from getting bored and one getting the brunt of the others boredome maybe??? Id also bring that girl to your home occassionally on a sat morn to bake cookies or something to try to promote a better relationship. I think things can be worked out.  I think that little girl is just stressed out, and your daughter will be fine I bet after awhile knowing its ok to sit alone and read at her house if shes tired or the other girl needs space.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i think you, your daughter and her friend and her friends mother should sit down together and discuss this<br>  <br>  <br>  they are 9 year old girls and do not know how to handle situations themselves<br>  <br>  showing them that talking things out can solve problems is a very good picture for the girls to see. taking your daughter away from the problem will probably not solve anything|`|CdTe8MO4aa	sit all the kids in a circle and pass a ball around<br>  when its there turn with the ball let them tell everyone what is bugging them and just keep doing it so they can releave stress<br>  <br>  we used to do that in school|`|eda699c69fc8eaff0f10239e82b318d9aa	What i think would be best is invite the mother and the daughter over to your house to talk about it, like over a lunch or something. instead of just commenting on it, have your daughter tell the mother what she's experiencing as well as what you are. Then maybe you could have the children talk to each other- make sure your daughter isn't in the wrong here either. It might also be beneficial for you to take the other girls side of the story. Hope this helped.|`|wIayNrbhaa	You should probably talk to your daughter about why she thinks the other girl is being mean to her. After that, maybe you could get all three of the girls together for like a tea party or a sleep over or something and see what you can do to eliminate the issue. The little girl probably has some issues at home. But if this doesn't work you may end up having to put her back in the after school program.
JRXpYW3Naa	I agree with it. I don't know if its true, but if it is, its a good thing. More women need to breastfeed and because WIC gives them formula alot of low income women don't even try.(at least in S. IL, that's the  case, they think they give me the formula, so why try?) And WIC is based on income, you have to make below a certain level.|`|UXoTCL98aa	I don't believe that. NOT AT ALL.  My wic office is very helpful regardless of whatever decision you make on breastfeeding or not. <br>  <br>  My brother in laws gf is due here in a few weeks and she went to the wic office recently and has it all set up to receive her formula cans when the baby comes.....you gotta wait and see which kind they tell you for your baby.  <br>  My sister still gets formula for her 7 month old baby as well. She does end up having to buy a few cans extra herself b/c they do give you a lot but just not quite enough.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	That's not true. I was there yesterday getting Jamie put on, and when they asked breast or bottle I said breast, but need a half ration for just in case something happens. They wrote that on the paper, we went and picked up the package (we have a distribution center) and it had his formula in it. He's 19 days old.<br>  <br>  And it does go by income in my state.|`|G3sSeUataa	That seems retarded to me, and about her lying on the application, that's retarded too, you have to bring your baby into the office to get it's iron checked!|`|Rujt27CFaa	Most states don't have an income standard, WIC is for pregnant women and children up to 6. Weather she is nursing or bottle feeding she can get lots of help from them|`|mbGOEZSAaa	I haven't heard anything like that|`|FXINmF6saa	No It's not true. They won't take your wic checks for no reason. They will only not give you formula checks if you borrow their breast pump and say you just breast fees. If you really aren't breast feeding they'll give you checks for I believe 9 cans in one month and cereal. If you let them know you are doing both I think they give you like 5 cans a month. There's no point in lying if the baby won't even drink that much formula. It's just a waste that can be used with other children who do need it. Good Luck! And tell her to be honest they won't do anything and if she really is just giving formula and they just won't give her the checks then she needs to talk to a supervisor and explain the problem they'll help her out.|`|aJTBF7opaa	Not sure where you live, and if they have changed but this does not sound right. First  of all WIC does have income requirements but they are high. Also they highly encourage mothers to breast feed but it is not mandatory, and especially for 6 months. What your sister is saying sounds ludicrous, but i can not answer for sure that it is incorrect.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	They will give out formula checks before 6 months! WIC doesn't descriminate if you don't breast ffed and there are income guidelines. They are higher than most assistance from my understanding but there are guidelines. I think that you shouldn't lie on these apps because if you can afford it, you should pay for it yourself. Also there are ways they cn check your income so she should watchi t if she does plan on lying!|`|my4GD7YVaa	She will get checks for lying, but she still won't get formula coupons it will be things like Milk, cheese, cereal, tuna, juice...<br>  <br>  I don't think thats really the right thing to do, but if she needs it I guess I could understand|`|UkQuMykiaa	I was able to get WIC when I was still pregnant and we went in once the babies were born and then got our formula checks.  We live in Ohio.|`|fMilDRgLaa	Not from the state I am from.  WIC will not keep a baby from getting the nourishment it needs.  Of course, breastfeeding is best.  It is your sister's choice.|`|3vzxSKLcaa	Oh I am not sure but I hope they don;t start doing that.  There are lots of mothers who can;t afford formula and that would be terrible if they started doing that.|`|paHbLR9aaa	I have never heard that they are no longer issuing WIC checks for formula for babies under 6 months of age.  And I don't see how she can lie on the application, or what she would lie about.|`|AA12150541	i havnt heard of them doing that and that doesnt sound right,,  why would they deny food to a baby?|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	no i have never heard of that...sounds made up to me|`|FYDw1rjlaa	I don't think that is true. I live in Minnesota and I have the WIC program right now. I have been having since 2006 with my first kid and still continue with my second and now with my third on the way. WIC will issue you checks for formula when the baby is born until he or she is one then they will issue for milk. The mother will continue to have WIC if she is breastfeeding but if she is not then she will get it for only 6 months after the baby is born. They do check your income but most people will the program. I think your sister should go back and talk to them because breastfeeding is optional. When I give birth to my two kids, I only breastfeed for a month or two and WIC still give checks for baby formula and for myself. I have never hear something like that about WIC and that is not true. They will issue you checks for formula whether you breastfeed or not.|`|g4mvfBQ8aa	Your income can qualify or disqualify you from receiving WIC.  They verify your income, so I don't know if she will get away with lying about it.  In my state, (NC) they give them the vouchers in the hospital before they leave, but they would have had to have applied before being admitted to the hospital.  WIC will give the mother a form that will tell babies birth weight and length and whether mom is breast or bottle and the nurse will sign it and mom to take to the office.  They don't have to wait till 6months here but it may vary state to state.  Alot of women won't even try breast because they know that they can receive WIC and if they say breast and bottle feeding, then WIC decreases the amount of cans of milk they get.   They know that and won't do it just for that reason alone.|`|52bAHCaUaa	I'm not sure if that is true or not. I know before I had my daughter I wanted to breast feed, and wanted to have formula just in case. Which, they told me they would give me, but only like 1 can. When that didn't work out (my daughter was born 3 months early) as soon as I told them I was no longer breastfeeding I started to receive formula.|`|1s3nddaYaa	hmm. it wasn't when i had wic. they gave formula until 12 months. they cant tell you weather to breast feed or not.|`|u94HOVz7aa	it is not true about them making you wait till 6 months. i got checks for formula when my baby was 2weeks old.  they do however lecture you about the benefits of breastfeeding and try to convince you to change your mind.  they are kinda breastfeeding nazi's but i guess that's what the government tells them they have to to continue to get funding.  as for they will give it to you no matter what your income is not true.  they have an income guideline.  they only help low income families they are kinda an extension on food stamps.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I'm on wic and they never told me that.  They just really encourage you to BF.  There has been times when I went to my appointment and said something like 'i hope I'll be able to" and all they said is to at least try and never said anything like "ya know, you won't be able to get help with formula until 6 months"....I don't think its true.  Especially because what about the moms that aren't physically able to breasfeed? You should call your WIC office and ask.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Thats not true here in OH.. my baby is 7 weeks and I get coupons for formula for her..    the WIC program may be different in other states tho.<br>  <br>  Not everyone can breastfeed, so it doesnt make sence why they wouldnt do it.  They encourage it..  and you get more food for yourself if you are breastfeeding<br>  <br>  You cant really lie tho..   lie about her baby's age?  They will want some kind of proof of the baby's age.|`|rAkWoweOaa	No it is not true.
XOnSRoR2aa	If someone gave you matches and told you to light a fire in Spanish class, would you? <br>  <br>  You knew that your friend would be incredibly hurt and angry when you told her all those mean things. How would you feel if someone told you that you were fat, had ugly teeth and that your boyfriend was dumb for going out with you or something else equally nasty and cruel? You would be hurt. I think you passed the message on not because you felt like you needed to - you knew that you had no obligation to do what this other girl asked - but because you wanted to see a little drama go down.<br>  <br>  You describe the girl you told all these things to as a "good friend" and so you should have been more loyal and protective of her from the start. When the other girl, the one you don't even seem to be all that close to, started to bash your friend you should have stood up for her, not in a heated, in-your-face kind of way but by simply pointing out some of the things you like about her or saying that you don't want to hear anything mean about her. It's hurtful to me when people insult my friends. I get defensive of them. You should feel that way about your friends, too. <br>  <br>  Now that it's happened, you should apologize to your friend. Imagine how hurt she must feel right now after being told all those ugly things AND being suspended on top of it. Try to cheer her up. If I were you, I'd rethink being friends with the other girl because she could just as easily decide to say nasty things about you one day.|`|VhH9RJrSaa	you should stay out of it from now on. its not your problem yea shes your friend you still shouldnt pass on gossip. next time tell that girl to tel her herself|`|YG7Prmoyaa	you did what you were supposed to do,<br>  but if it was me, <br>  i wouldnt have told my friend.<br>  1 so i wouldnt hurt her feelings<br>  and 2 so a problem like that one wouldnt have started.<br>  but she told u to tell her, sooo i really dont know.<br>  i would have thought more before i made that decision<br>  ;D|`|ce1cd1ce55b68d3025b9888a8f58c391aa	You are an instigator.<br>  Get your nose out of peoples business.<br>  <br>  You just did that because you wanted something to go down and you get to watch.|`|8e5YBwd7aa	Well she told you to tell her So its her problem not yours.
mvqfIjEVaa	I don't see why not.  The only danger would be in getting a blood borne disease like HIV or Hepatitis C.  But if you're going to a clean reputable place, the risk of that is slim to none.  I think the reason it's not a great idea while preggo is that any infection, even from bad aftercare, can have an effect on the baby.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Sure.  The ink won't get into the milk.<br>  <br>  (Do be aware that if you're still carrying a lot of pregnancy weight, the look of the tattoo might change as you lose the weight.)|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Ask this in the tattoo section. The people here know nothing about tattoos. I guarantee your answers will be different there. It is not okay. Not if you want to eliminate all risk to your baby. Personally, I wouldn't take even the tiniest risk of allowing my child to contract a blood borne potentially deadly virus just because I wanted a tattoo.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	Its perfectly fine. The ink particles are too big to got through the milk. I had a tattoo at 8 weeks PP while I was still breastfeeding, the place was clean and the artist said its perfectly safe. <br>  <br>  Just make sure its a place you trust.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I don't see why it wouldn't be...maybe call a lactation consultant and ask them? Once again, I can't see why it would be harmful, you aren't supposed to get one when pregnant due to infection, but you don't really pass infections like that on in breastmilk.|`|wphLaVs6aa	The ink molecules used in tattooing are too large to pass through breastmilk. You can read about getting a tattoo while breastfeeding here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/FAQ/tattoos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/FAQ/tattoos.html</a>|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Everyone who said its fine is correct. I'm getting one over the summer, as I haven't quite decided on WHAT yet...<br>  <br>  Like you said, a good, clean place and proper aftercare.|`|sp7yqqKNaa	.. noooo..<br>  why do you think they ask if youve had a tattoo in the last 6 months when you go to give blood?<br>  it kind of taints it temporarily i think<br>  <br>  but i know for sure, no|`|3vzxSKLcaa	I would just wait to be safe, but it is probably fine.  iDK sorry
g7igaa38aa	It will not necessarily take you that long to conceive.  There is no sure-fire way to guarantee you conceive when you want to.  Many perfectly healthy couples try for months before conceiving.  Remember that there is nothing wrong with you, keep trying and be patient.  My current wife has 2 children previous to our meeting and they were both conceived on the first try.  My 2 children were conceived on the first try.  When we tried to conceive together, it took 5 months for us to be successful.  We bought the First Response Ovulation test and it helped to track her most fertile days.  I would recommend this for your situation as well.  Keep your head up and just keep trying, it will happen.  Maybe this time it will be on the first try.|`|vigFmfLmaa	My mom got pregnant with me almost instantly, my brother took 9 months of trying and my sister was an oops.  Same women, totally different timing.  You might get lucky on the first try or two this time.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	You have a 25-30% chance of conceiving each month.  Some people conceive right away one time, and then take a year another time.  My son was conceived in 2 months, and now we are on our 7th cycle ttc #2.  You just never know, you may get pregnant sooner this time.  A lot of women get pregnant faster after a miscarriage.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|umdKUxSDaa	75% of couples conceive in the first year of trying. 25% first month of trying, i got pregnant the first month after trying sadly it ended in a miscarriage. but i think i'm pregnant again now. so are you having sex while your ovulating???|`|37dab5663389d7a1f34cbddd0a2bdab0aa	I don't know hun, I've been asking myself the same question!!! <br>  <br>  It's a difficult road, that's for sure. Hopefully good things will come our way!

Its just part of pregnancy. Sometimes stretching and Yoga can help with this pain. The twitching sounds to me like you are feeling the baby move. Three months is early, but no too early. Now if you are seeing the twitching on the surface of the skin and it is constant, you might talk to the doctor. Bananas have potassium in them that can help with twitching as well.|`|65x0vJNnaa	There are all kinds of muscles that are stretched and seperated during preganacy,  it the pain is severe contact your doctor.  the twitching could be the baby I know it is kinda early but depending on where the baby is attached it could be.

iVcaB9h7aa	All the states have different laws but generally single people can adopt.  If you live in the US, look at the document linked below and locate the information for your state.  For instance, the following are the laws for Illinois:<br>  <br>  Who May Adopt<br>  Citation: 750 ILCS 50/2<br>  The following persons may adopt:<br>  A resident for at least 6 months or a member of the armed forces domiciled in the State for 90 days<br>  A reputable adult of either sex<br>  A minor with leave of the court<br>  Husband and wife must petition jointly.<br>  Residency requirement does not apply to a related child or to an agency placement.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i dont see why you cant. on martian child he was a single man and adopted the kid|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Like others have said..yes single men and women can adopt. <br>  <br>  It is a bit harder though than a married couple. Single men have more scrutiny than single women. <br>  <br>  Depending on the form of adoption (private agency, through foster care, international) you can run into some issues. Not all agencies allow singles regardless of their sex. <br>  <br>  Some countries allow single women but not men or have an age requirement. They will have the stipulation that the adoptive parent must be X years older than the child they are adopting if its the opposite sex. <br>  <br>  So yes you can most certainly adopt as a single man or woman you just may have to jump through a handful more hoops or look around a bit more for an agency to work with you.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Absolutely a single person can adopt.<br>  <br>  Ironically, you can't have a partner, unless you're married in our state to legally adopt (Arkansas).|`|7JEojMgQaa	Yes they can. Men looking for young females is scrutinized but adoption by singles is an option.|`|AA12174100	every state has their own rules on that but I think most allow single people to adopt.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	It's not required through foster care.  You just need to be 21 and financially stable.<br>  <br>  Most agencies require you to have been married for 2 - 5 years before they'll allow you to adopt from them.<br>  <br>  I choose to adopt through the foster care system though.|`|oiJITSNZaa	it all depends on the agency. Some refuse to look at single people though i know there are some out there that do. So search your resources.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Yes single men and women can adopt,
3K1QW7Oeaa	The first you need to do is CALM THE **** DOWN!    Second, if the school form did actually say "We do not have the responsibilities of anything that happens outside of school," then they have no reason to be involved.    Third, it's typical for Middle School students to treat you like that! I remembered when I was in Middle School, there were students saying EVERYTHING that they can to get me worked up. From "fag" to "I'm gonna find out where you live and when I do, I will slash your throat when you're asleep." You name it! I had everything said to me! IGNORE THEM! They're just talking crap just to see a reaction coming through you and get a kick out of it. And sometimes THEY don't realize what they say will get them in trouble!    When you become a Sophomore or a Junior in High School, you will realize that all that crap they said in Middle School was nothing but "childish, immature behavior."    I hope you learned your lesson through all this and move on.|`|KyVi3nJnaa	CALM DOWN!  Yes, what you did was stupid (why were you trying to talk to someone who doesn't want to talk to you anyway?), but the world isn't going to end.  You apologized to the two boys and were already scolded by the principal, so I think that it's time to move on.  The Principal probably has more important things to worry about that bothering your parents about this issue.  As for the boys saying things like "I hope you go to jail", they are just trying to work you up ( and it's obviously working).  Time to move on.  Hopefully you've learned your lesson.|`|hIwqr2Idaa	unless you said something bad about them on the account, then you have nothing to worry about.|`|AA11170799	Whoa... calm down!!! This is NOT THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!!!! God I hated middle school. So much drama. Recently, a girl pretended to be a boy on MySpace so she could fool another girl. Eventually, she told the girl (while pretending to be the boy) that she should kill herself. The girl hung herself that night. Ever since then, parents and teachers have been really on-edge about this type of thing. I really, really recommend that you approach your parents when they are both calm and say, "I have to tell you about something. You might want to punish me, but I didn't mean to do anything wrong."|`|HWtG9dkzaa	Yes - what you did was both stupid and illegal.    But this is an incident that happened outside of school, so the chances are, the school won't get that involved in it. Your principal only got involved to let you know that you did something stupid, and illegal.    Mind you - you never know - your parents may be contacted, and told of what happened.|`|kKZZTb3gaa	wtf?? Calm down. You didnt know.    Its ok.. your friends are over reacting..    And.. im sorry but ths suicide hotline is stupid.

It's cute though.<br>  <br>  I absolutely do not like the name Naomi. I know it's a biblical name, but not everyone will think of it that way. The movie Van Wilder ruined it for me (even though I did not like the name before) because of what it spells backwards.

ztrRs62Daa	I like Leonardo, but you and your partner both have to agree, really! I think Leonard is quite nice if you like that.. You could reason to your partner that if you call him Leonardo it can be shortened to both Leo and Leon.. Or you could just refer to him as any of the three!<br>  <br>  I agree that Leonardo is a lovely name! And it is very strong because the name comes from 'Leo-' which means lion and 'hardhu' which mean strong and valorous. So it basically means the strength of a lion! Which is nice :)|`|RjpGomsyaa	I would choose Leon because  i think its ok for a boy thru till a man|`|u7o75zipaa	I really don't like Leonardo. <br>  It just makes me think of an old man.<br>  <br>  I absolutely adore Leon though :) My friends sister actually called her baby Leon (Leon James I think) and he's so adorable!!<br>  x|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Well, if your partner thinks Leonardo is horrible then that rules that one out!  I don't think it's horrible, but I'm not a huge fan of it either.  Leo is really more of a nickname than a given name.  Leon is good (it was actually down to Leon and one other name for me and my husband when we were still deciding on a boy's name), and I don't think it is any less unique than Leonardo.  After all, how many Leons have you met personally?  According to most names rankings Leon isn't even in the top 300 most popular names.  Leonardo on the other hand has been in the top 200 for several years.  Statistically speaking Leon is a MORE unique name!  And Leonardo can carry the unfortunate nickname of "Nard" or "Nardo" if someone wants to be really cruel.|`|gJBqAXwtaa	i LOVE the name leonardo but then you could shorten it to leo too instead of him having a long name.<br>  Leonardo is such a lovely and unique name (it just reminds me of leonardo dicaprio but i did have a rush on him whn i was younger lol)<br>  <br>  i don't like leon at all (sorry) <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  STICK TO YOUR GUNS ON LEONARDO!!|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	I love the name Leonardo and Leo but dislike Leon :o)|`|cn2rvsdOaa	Leo|`|9EdUCTwjaa	i luv that name...i personally like Lenny, or Leo, if you give him a middle name that starts with a J, you can call him L.J.|`|1aedb3e2dfe276d9756f4cf4095308efaa	I love Leonardo, and if he chooses to be called Leo or even shorten it to Leon (which I don't care for), then he has the option when he's older.|`|IngripgMaa	Have you thought about Leondro instead, maybe?

He will thank you when he is older as Leonardo is a very masculin name, and if he thinks Leo is to babyish he can use his full name. I would go for it.|`|9OKG0a5Baa	i like leonardo and leo for short (leo is not kiddish it sounds cool).  leon i really dislike, its kinda chavy.<br>  how about just leonard (len-ad) as a compromise to your partner.  <br>  good luck and congratulations|`|xhyR869faa	Leo is a bit kiddy, he might not like it when hes older<br>  Leon is a lovely name, probably the best one there.<br>  Leonardo is very oldfashioned, too old for a baby boy<br>  <br>  I say Leon :)|`|89QEJBIAaa	Leo and Leon are more modern, but if someone was named Leonardo they could go by the nickname Leo or Leon.|`|l8gVfm0Raa	I like leon but I think I like Leonardo more|`|gQEFy4BVaa	Leo, although I prefer it as a nickname for Leander.

You can usually find all kinds of free stuff there... perhaps even toddler clothes..<br>  <br>  and to answer your question, I don't know.... I think everyone is on edge right now because of the economy...|`|aJTBF7opaa	Because people feel that they have nothing better to do then bash and turn down other people.

I'm often seeing people give away clothing and toys for children.  I prefer to shop consignment sales and shops, and I turn around and reconsign my daughter's clothes.  I get my clothes for much cheaper than I would pay even at Wal-Mart and they're excellent/new quality.<br>  <br>  I'm all about recycling and reusing.
GWveqx61aa	many things can cause you not to get preg, and some birth control could take up to 3 yrs to get out of your system, hopefully everything is fine, it can take a healthy couple  a while to conceive as well, many things can affect getting preg.good luck and baby dust to us all|`|EEdzRCQKaa	i think it will be in your system still but most people say it takes about a year to conceive a baby just keep trying that's the best part : )|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	It can take anywhere from a few weeks to a year for your body to regulate its natural hormone levels  once you stop taking the pill. The best thing to do is use OPK's to see if you can detect ovulation. If you are not ovulating, call your dr and they can prescribe medications to help you start ovulating again.|`|Tk1QJJsZaa	If you're trying to get pregnant, most doctors recommend you use an alternate form of birth control for at least 6-8 weeks after going off birth control pills. This is because the resideual hormones in your system may have an adverse effect on your baby. Once you stop taking the birth control pill,the hormones are out of your body. the hormones in birth control pills have no adverse effects on a baby. It's physically possible to get pregnant after missing as little as one birth control pill. You don't even have to be off them entirely.<br>  gud luck!|`|MJI8murVaa	Dr Irina Webster.

It can take up to a complete year for it to be out of your system. Don't stress about it hun. That is why you haven't gotten preg yet. It is because you are stressing too much. Good luck and God bless ya.|`|OiJnlRicaa	yes, when on birth control for a long period of time it takes as long as on to clear out of system. Both parties should consult a doctor just to be sure.

LSxBwiFSaa	Logic dictates; that ANYTHING that affects YOU, is going to affect your baby... And since a Baby's metabolism is naturally MORE sensitive to outside "stimuli"- it is inevitable that those "affects" are going to be that much more Profound... This is "why" Doctors caution pregnant women to be "CAREFUL" what they do TO, & put IN -their bodies... Because what a Mother's body can "handle"- a fetus might NOT... :o|`|sAbah6dTaa	well i know someone who did while she was pregnant... there is nothing physically wrong with her daughter but she is very hyper and bossy and very anal about things (not in a spoiled daughter way but in a medically wrong way) and I'd like to think this was because her mom did smoke when she was pregnant. <br>  <br>  her sister, her mom didn't do it with with her and she is a very laid back easy going child.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I know someone who did that with all of her children and all 3 have developmental delays. Her oldest has ADHA her 2nd has a speech problem (he's 3 and doesn't speal at all with out the hekp of this computer thing and her youngest just screams constantly (which is the same thing her 2nd child did)|`|3fYRi1y4aa	I have been around 2 ppl.  whose mothers smoked while they were in the womb.  Both are physically fine but mentally slow.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	ok i am not saying it is good or bad to use drugs while pregnant HOWEVER..... a girl i know (actually a couple) have smoked weed during their pregnancies and their babies turned out just fine. to this day they are happy healthy children that don't have any type of delay or medical problems. now when it comes to other drugs i have seen a baby girl who's mother was on cocaine and heroine who after birth ended up going through with-drawls and had to be put in the hospital for almost a month because of it. <br>  i know that drugs aren't good while pregnant and i haven't really done the research into how bad weed is for a baby (in the womb) but i don't know how it's so horribly bad when it's supposed to be natural (i mean marijuana is a plant). i would think smoking cigarettes is 100X worse but again i never did the research so i don't really know.<br>  but anyway that is MY personal experience with the situation i have seen a few girls who have smoked weed while pregnant (through their whole pregnancy) and the children turned out just fine.<br>  (again i am not saying smoking weed is ok during pregnancy)|`|gEmw0Gc9aa	there is no known effect on the baby. i took a child development class last quarter and we were actually told that if you need some kind of high or drunk or something marijuana would be MUUCH better than alcohol because it doesn't not effect the baby.|`|GiYVrmI3aa	That question is in no way an opinion. There is scientific evidence that proves that the use of marijuana while pregnant can cause the child to be undersized, retarded, and have other learning disabilities.|`|ZicqULySaa	For not wishing to name names I'll be using other names in place of the actual people but they were all friends (or ex friends) of mine.<br>  <br>  Dede did it while she was pregnant and the baby came out early with all kind of problems. Dede's best friend (because they were both potheads) did it as well (Dede was saying so while she was pregnant because I was asking her about why she was smoking pot WHILE she was pregnant) and she says that her friends daughter came out fine, but I have the opinion (upon meeting the child) that the child was not only hyper-active, but quick-tempered, stubborn, and a bit pushy. Katie did it and her child is a bit autistic (or at least I think so by the way he sometimes acts). And last, I KNOW Amy did it because her husband says that that was the only way he would get her to eat in the last trimester (with this last child), and both of her kids are very slow in development.|`|RQvLrKMXaa	Well I have known several pregnant women.  Family members and friends.  I've known two who did smoke weed during their pregnancy and there has been no visible effect on the children since their birth, however, I personally believe that a pregnant woman should use better judgment than to get high.  It is a known fact that everything that is consumed by the pregnant mother is shared with the fetus.  That's why doctors recommend that women don't smoke or drink during their pregnancies.
oUqHe4BHaa	ok i'm just going to say as i, being about the same age as y'all, cannot believe the whole fingering thing. that's so sick! blek! but if the fact that he "fingered" some girl is true, i wouldn't be the boy's friend anyway, but that's just me......|`|4p9ESShFaa	well both the nasty girl and her friend sound like a nasty piece of work. if i were you i would square up to her and give her a smack in the face but thats just what us english girls are like. tell him he should trust you and just tell him what they actually did, tell him if you really hated him then why would you try so hard to make him know that this isnt true and that you really do like him - cos if i hated someone i wouldnt speak to them. the phone plan is a really good idea, he cant escape from the conversation but i think going up to him in person may be a good idea too. never give up because when you least expect it, he will decide enough is enough.  good luck :)
vue9NOhYaa	Used correctly, condoms are very reliable. (About 2% of women using them will become pregnant in a year's time.)<br>  <br>  If you want to be extra careful, you could pull out to, but it's really not necessary.  What IS necessary is that you understand how to use the condom correctly, and put it on before there is any genital contact.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	make sure when you put it on you hold the tip and leave room at the tip therre shouldn't be any air bubbles, if you dont leave room or get the air out it can break.......<br>  <br>  you can only use somer spermicidal gel to be extra cautious|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Well, you still have the risk of the condom slipping off and it only takes one sperm to fertilize an egg and create a human being. <br>  <br>  I would highly suggest using spermicide along with the condoms. It's a huge help in preventing an unplanned pregnancy and they're about as inexpensive as condoms. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that deoending on what type of birth control she chooses, you may still have to use these back up protection methods for some time after starting the birth control as some kinds of b.c. do not take immediate effect. <br>  <br>  Good luck and that's great that you even asked!|`|PYtJ2GoFaa	She can for sure get pregnant if you use the pull out method. Sperm is still ejaculated in small portions before a male actually orgasms. I would wait until she has been on the pill for a couple of months. If you want to be really safe, use a condemn and pull out, just in case. Condoms are not 100% effective either. <br>  <br>  You both want the experience to be enjoyable, but how can you if you are going to be worried the entire time that something might go wrong. Be safe. (By the way, if you use a condom, do not double pack, the friction causes it to ware down and it can rupture during sex).|`|x8JRkRNkaa	Since you'll be wearing a condom it wont make it safer to pull out. As long as you wear it properly you don't have to do anything extra.|`|gfEPAPJ8aa	still the possibility, if you want safe put on a rubber dude|`|dv3z9MyDaa	Just leave it in. As long as you give her a good slap in the face when its over she wont get pregnant.

yrx6GxDcaa	I adopted my wifes son at the age of 5 he was 2 when we got married. I never really thought about it but at 5 he asked me why we had different last names. We explained it to him and three days later he said he wanted my last name. His father had nothing to do with him never payed child support i even paid doctor bills my wife had from her first marriage from his many stays at the hospital because of a very rare disease. We talked to a lawyer because i was told by someone i knew that was a judge that heard cases like this  that it did not matter if he had anything to do with the child the courts would not approve it and if they did there was a possibility some where down the road he could fight me and probably get custody as the real father. Thank God he signed the papers me and my wife met him at an attorneys office in a different state and he signed the papers and never even said a word. My son is now 33 years old and his real father has had contact with him many times but you know what he told me he was my father but you are my dad. Believe me there is a lot of difference. Get an attorney and do what your heart tells you.|`|AA10186411	You have to get a lawyer.

aZwaCKgdaa	LOL - The weight limit is 25lbs.    Funny bouncy seat story -- but my 9-month old outgrew it MUCH earlier.  I was taking a shower when she was about 7 months and she was strapped into the bouncy seat in the bathroom with me.  She was fussing, so I opened the shower door and peeked out.  I saw an upside-down bouncy seat moving toward the door.  She figured out how to throw her body forward until she was on her feet, then fall onto her belly with the seat still strapped to her.  She looked like a turtle crawling away.  I just about peed myself!  Every time I would try to put her in it after that time, she would immediately flip it over and crawl away with it on her back. :)  It makes me smile just thinking about it.  Oh, at the time, she was about 15lbs!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Was it this one?  http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/176...    If so, yes, the weight limit is 25 lbs.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Is it this one?  http://www.target.com/Bright-Starts-Boun...    If so the weight limit is 25 lbs. I think that's pretty standard. We have the infant to toddler rocker though and it goes up to a higher weight limit(I think 40 lbs.)|`|awRNr2VMaa	my friend has a 2 month old and a 3 and a half year old. her 3 year old sits in his baby brothers bouncer and he weighs 33 lbs. its just a 16 to 20 dollar one from walmart. if you look it up at walmart.com it should have the weight limit on it.|`|sAAnquoTaa	Our's is Graco from Walmart and the weight lmit is 25lbs.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I think the weight limit on most of the bouncy seats are 20-25 pounds.

I think they do it, more than Halloween.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	In Australia we don't really celebrate Halloween :-\ I forgot it was Halloween and 2 people knocked on my door and I was confused why they were there. It isn't really a big deal at all here.    But from what I hear and see on Y!A and other places - yes, probably.|`|KwJDWvB3aa	DUDE I KNOW! its so stupid..now theres like 12 -16 year olds running around as slutty cops and stuff....im 17 and i dont do that..this year i was a flapper girl but it wasn't slutty. ahaah but i know exactly what you mean..its soooo lame...they just want attention|`|sVa5xELDaa	psh i dont dress like a slut on halloweeen    i dont even dress up for halloween actually|`|jzdDF3Ljaa	no duh, of course girls use halloween as an excuse to look like a slut.|`|MIUzgwsTaa	I saw that on mean girls (a movie)  and it's fun to dress how you want without being judged   after all it's only once a year|`|GK4G5Yt1aa	my friends and i dressed up as business men for halloween.  but my guess is most girls do.|`|6gthdHpnaa	Some of them do, some of them don't.|`|wlgRsZpfaa	i know. its not very good. halloween is a kids holiday, not a sl*t's holiday. they really should change that. one of my good friends was batgirl and her boobs were bulging and were thong was showing from the back.|`|TPn3CEK0aa	Yea, its just an excuse.  They dont even want candy, they would rather have dildos.  I know I would.|`|XtbjzpK7aa	some girls do that. but not all.|`|LSkeAPBIaa	Ha the teachers at my school say that Halloween is MW hooker day. Yea girls do.|`|ZAppRn5Faa	hahaha yeahh everyone does that. even i take advantage of it :)  and i'm certainlyyy not a slutt what so ever
qlA9Lhazaa	Love Salem Kaine! Aven Rook is beautiful|`|dY671gAoaa	Sora Masen!! So beautiful, I would pronounce it like Sorrah :)    Rellah Marie is pretty as well!|`|oqOBQe7aaa	What About Keira Elizabeth or Zalie|`|5sYzlAjPaa	i like Sora Mason and Rellah Marie - interesting and refreshing names.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I'd probably choose Rellah Marie out of that group.     I really like Ellery though, I just don't like Sinclaire as a middle name.|`|WjxqhZG9aa	I think that Aven Rook is pretty, I also like Merritt, but not paired with Rome.  Salem is interesting also.|`|btXI9gNhaa	I like Ellery Sinclaire|`|ZZ6fJqCbaa	I would choose Salem Kaine.  I think it rolls off the tongue easier then the rest.|`|fEcNMm05aa	I love Rellah Marie.    Very pretty=]|`|Xa6i4VG0aa	I love Ellery Sinclare.    Take care, God bless. : )|`|e82a823b890a1b465c57df534fd4f153aa	Actually I like all of them but the 1st.  I would probably choose Sora Masen or Aven Rook.  You're a great name picker  :-)|`|9jh0Hho9aa	i like Ellery Sinclaire, Merritt Rome, and Aven Rook  I'd probably go with Ellery Sinclaire or Merritt Rome|`|OhaosQ14aa	rellah marie
L4lOXfKcaa	I am 39 weeks and I have been having this pain for about a month and the doc told me it was the baby's head in position pushing down. Depending on how many weeks you are. It should be something normal. Its a horrible feeling. I also had it in the beginning of my 2nd trimester and that was because my baby was in the breach position and she was pushing down with her feet. Its a pretty bad pain/pressure that makes you feel like you have to run to the bathroom because everything is goin to come out. It should be normal. Its just the baby pushing. Trust me I have a lot of that happening to me.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i was having those pains last week! my doctor said it was all associated with round ligament...but i'm going to keep checking back with answers because i'd like to hear what other people are saying..|`|4xDDR7c3aa	IM RIGHT THERE WITH YOU! Its so annoying, I really do wish someone had a better answer lol|`|3aqm1SDbaa	My doctor said it could be nerves, if the baby puts pressure on a nerve it can cause shooting pains or constant pain which is what I have.|`|iq5uwobOaa	My neighbor is 9 months pregnant and she was telling me something about her ligaments not connected correctly that causes her to have pain in her vagina.      I wish I could remember what it was.       I would just ask your ob, maybe he/she knows what it is
kdxxuQwNaa	No, guy's don't like it when the girl is taller. Your good.|`|hOEIFpl5aa	im almost 15(like in 20ish days) and im 5'3ish, or 5'2ish|`|Jucak0HLaa	No that's normal|`|ipWhwFKYaa	to me you poabably are i am 5 ft. and 14|`|nGwzzNTFaa	I'm TALLER THAN YOU!  you are not tall.  you are not tall.  you are not tall.  you are not tall.  OK kapish kapish.|`|Aa7dLKntaa	5'5 is average yer lucky tho cuz im 4'10 xD|`|zjuMrDmGaa	No, you're normal. My daughter is tall....she's 5'9" at 13!|`|tBTGwOmHaa	I am 13 and 5'5 and I am average|`|mb9pL423aa	I'm 17 and I've been 5'4" since I was 12. It's average.|`|5xAu3RAZaa	not really. i'm your age and i'm 5"8.  ur definetly average. i used to be 5" 2 last year lolllzz      btw how do u get the music signs on your namee?
yznZqcznaa	I say boy because it looks like over 30% to me.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I guess girl but I'm new to the nub theory.  Have you posted these on in-gender.com?  There are ladies on there that are very accurate at guessing based on this theory.|`|wBpennsMaa	You can start to tell the sex a few days into your 16th week of pregnancy via ultrasound.|`|ThvxVuILaa	i think its a girl
kPl8TTzNaa	Love that name. It is pronounced (ROM illy). And it is a female's name. The pronunciation is pretty straight forward.|`|dY671gAoaa	I knew a girl called Romilly and she pronounced it    Rome-ily.    But everyone called her Romy, like Romey :)|`|DkUwkU6Waa	I think its Row-mill-ee and i think its a girls name.|`|fEcNMm05aa	Roe-Milly    Sounds kind of unusual.  Her nickname could be Milly though. Which would be adorable.    I think it'd be a girl name only.    :D|`|4bzZNCYBaa	I have heard it as a girls' name pronounced ROH-mil-ee|`|qAZXGxDLaa	Girl:Rome-ily|`|3XaREbrQaa	it can be either a girls or a boys name, and its pronounced raw-MIL-lee. its a really cute name!
HBgnkltfaa	You already have a great list going!    Here are some others:  Clara  Agnes  Rowena  Susannah  Opal  Eleanor  Leta  Louisa  Marian  Octavia  Christabel  Rosamund  Rosalind  Dorothy/Dorothea  Adelaide  Hazel  Helen/Helena  Alice  Isadora  Delphina  Theresa  Frances  Mabel  Pearl  Blanche  Stella  Georgia  Ruth  Augusta  Sylvia  Rhoda  Lenora  Lois  Wilhelmina (Willa)  Corinna  Aurelia  Sophronia  Odessa  June|`|U1h6Dntjaa	You left off your own name!  Oh, and Cora is a great one!    Eva  Nora  Josephine  Viola  Clara  Ellen  Helen  Helena  Ora  Willa  Glenna      Hm...a lot of them end in -a.  A common trend throughout the decades, I think, though.  I picked my names from the US top 1000 in 1903.|`|CI4oAV0oaa	Scarlet|`|jU80mmJraa	Susanna  dixie    idk lol|`|Qp79sBF7aa	I love your name by the way!  I think Evelyn, Guineviere (sp?), Malia, Josephine, Anneley/Annalee/Annaleigh, and Mary/Rose/Grace have always been popular, but now more for middle names or in combo with other names.|`|EnyhoOmTaa	Ada, Alice, Amelia, Audra, Audrey, Ava, Caroline, Chloe, Clara, Dorothy, Eleanor, Elise, Elizabeth, Elena, Ella, Emma, Elena,  Eva, Evelyn, Evie, Faith, Fiona, Grace, Harriet,  Helena,  Iris, Ivy, Lilith, Lillian, Mabel, Maisie, Maggie, Margaret, Martha, Mary, Olivia, Sadie, Sophia, Violet,  Winifred?|`|WapGLYvOaa	annabelle  antoinette  iris  mayrose  mabel  octavia  olive  aroura  arabella|`|be5IoBEmaa	Most of the names I write about fit that definition - a few of my favorites from recent months include:    Cloelia  Coralie  Dinah  Hester  Zenaida|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Ida    Alice    Clara    Florence    Martha    Ada    Pearl    Dora    Stella    Della    Harriet    Lydia    Viola    Virginia|`|ZX2so3twaa	audrey.  i really like adeline and emmeline :]|`|tWKZVDG2aa	Ada, Amelia, Audrey, Meridith, Iris, Gwendoline, Daisy, Pandora, Clara, Evelyn, Joy, Alma..    There are some off the top of my head.  I love "old fashoined" names, they are unusual yet a little bit better than some of the made up names we have now adays.
HBgnkltfaa	It's a good name.  I want to like it more than I actually do, though.    I love the meaning ("reborn") because of its spiritual significance.  I also think it has a pleasant rhythm.  When I was little, I knew a very kind old German woman with this name, so that should be another point in its favor.    For some reason, I'm just not wild about it, though.  I'll give it an 8 out of 10, since it has so much going for it, but I wish I could rate it higher.|`|ZX2so3twaa	like 4.  i think there are way better names out there.|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I would rate it a 7. it is refreshing and interesting.|`|McRoWQrAaa	seriously, a 1.  i know a guy named RENATO.  uhhmm no.|`|xLabGD6Maa	I give it a 10; it's my cousin's name.|`|5HGDhEjyaa	I rate it a 9.  It's different and if you choose a nice middle name to go with it, it'll be even better.  Good luck.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I personally don't like it. It would be nice on a Maori or Polynesian girl though. I just can't see it on an American one. I would rate it a 5 out of 10 :)|`|X14EmlrXaa	9! Here's why  It is very unique and bold  but you didn't get a full 10. Why? Because I think it kinda sounds like an old person name  But I still am in the Renata fan club|`|jU80mmJraa	its cute  4-6|`|5akOX2M4aa	8!|`|j2qrOjo1aa	no sounds like a coffee drink|`|jlrJhCMKaa	pretty...is it Italian?|`|WapGLYvOaa	i love it. its very pretty. you cant have a nickname with that name, but you dont need one. i would rate it a 7. there are names i like a lot better, but i still love it. i have a friend named renata.|`|d802e4569c99ca9c59f3b076b0963fedaa	Renata is a cute name.
b3CwObBdaa	Yup.  I think that's why some women opt for enema's before the pushing starts.|`|yB5go5wbaa	Yes, I read it's a healthy sign of labor actually, because it means the baby is moving down correctly. I doubt your doctor or nurses will even mention it, I think they just clean it up and get on with it!  And you probably won't even care or notice at that point...you'll just be concentrating on getting through contractions!|`|T8zPA3FJaa	It surely does.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	I've seen this question on here before, I think people are getting near their due date and starting to freak out a little:) Not all people experience that problem. Yes, it has happened to some people, but it is not an every delivery occurence. Usually before you go into labor your body naturally cleanses the body, you'll go to the bathroom a little more. Don't worry about it.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	It does. But while I was labor I had 2 loose bowel movements. When I got to pushing, there was nothing left to push out. It was mother natures way of cleaning out my system.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	If you have an epidural they give you a colostomy bag.|`|GZrR0uxjaa	yes, its gross, but all that pressure down there kinda just makes it come out lol, that's what happened with me, i hope not this time around though..|`|wUfZJvbUaa	believe it or not, this is quite common.. and yes, it just comes out... but the staff is totally ready for it.|`|MtU2yH3gaa	Yeah, so I have heard it does. I was so worried about that when I was pregnant with my first, but ended up having a c-section and it didn't matter then. But I asked my doctor about it, and she said it happens ALL the time, and most the time you won't even know, the nurse cleans it up so fast it's never a big deal at all. So try not to worry about it!|`|jLf2Lbbcaa	Yes, it just comes out.|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	Happens all the time. The midwives and doctors have seen it all before a million times. Most women actually do have a bowel motion during childbirth but wouldn't even know it because the hospital staff are professional and discreet, and before you even know it's happened, it has been taken care of. Don't worry, its a natural occurence and nothing to feel embarrassed about.|`|mCDopsLEaa	yes. when you push, you are pushing down on EVERYTHING, so it is common to poo a little while pushing.|`|9iOHAC41aa	Yea it does. But don't be too worried about it because the doctors are used to it. Beside lol it's not like you can just get up and go to the bathroom while in labor. Don't even worry about it.|`|5099ffc117e8dfe6b95f19667ddf615baa	Yep it happened with my second baby and doctors are used to it its nature.You wont care because your too bust pushing let me tell it like this,your not going to care if you fart when someone punches you in the nose...all your cares are on the pain.|`|SIrmqu5maa	Wow, I was just thinking about this the other day!|`|u12eVaDhaa	It sure does!!!  Midwives are soooo used to it.|`|3aqm1SDbaa	yep, it actually happens a lot.|`|KL9RvYQ8aa	I work in a hospital and last week a lady wanted to use the toilet and whilst on there she gave birth to a little boy.  She was premature but it does happen.      Baby was a bit shocked and had a bit of a bash on the head, but all turned out well.
41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	While I am pregnant, I find it much easier to sleep with a body pillow.  It would be well worth the $10 investment.  Also, try to read if you wake in the middle of the night, that helps sometimes too.  Hang in there, I know how hard it can be.|`|VUss5AfAaa	well tea works for me..i try not to take naps when im tired so i can sleep it all at night.|`|LABC73E7aa	well i always take a walk every night like a mile. then i take a hot bath and relax. dont eat sugar too late and also dont lay in bed and watch tv cause u will be up all night then!|`|17MZkNpZaa	i put pillows between my legs ( i am also pregnant) i take one pillow, put it between my legs turn on my side and i fall asleep quick.    you can try a regular pillow or invest in one of those pregnancy pillows      you may also want to try exercising i "heard" that worst as well|`|bfmoMc4Haa	i suffered terrible morning sickness and my baby doctor told me of a great cure which is half a unisom tab combined with b6 and yes it did help with the sickness but also helps me sleep very well at night,    ive talked to other doctors and hopital staff during my pregnancy and they have all assured me that half a unisom is perfectly ok... my baby is healthy and due in 6 weeks time,    ive done lots of research online too and so many women swear by unisom as a sleep aid and also to combat nausea - my mother used it too during her pregnancies and had 3 healthy babies. a good nights sleep is needed to keep mommies to be healthy and well!    of course its up to you and a more natural remedy could work just as well but unisom is worth a try if sleepnights continue, good luck and congrats on your little one!
fu1bZT3Taa	I think that they don't let you take that type of decision at such an early age because your soo young and you really don't have the judgment to make such a strong and definite decision over something like that.  I don't agree with the girls that use abortions as birth control, its not right and they are not using that choice that is available to us in the usa correctly.  Congrats on your 3 kids and Good luck on the upcomming procedure!!!|`|cjmP2ACDaa	I think in those cases where the woman are using the abortion as birth control is really wrong. My friends sister is like that and it really bothers me to no end! In that case if woman have an abortion more than twice in their life the states should enforce sterilization!|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	Well there are many laws that are 21 plus to make sure the person is really sure of them. Think if you had been steralized you wouldnt have baby  3. Someties when you get older you change your mind . Theyare afraid of lawsuits so they make us wait till 21

eeGN977eaa	As bad as it is, I smoke in the car with the window down too. I have tried to limit my in-car smoking to when I am by myself but do occasionally smoke when the kids are with me.     If you think about it, the car stinks even if you only smoke with the window is down. To me that means that smoke is still in the car even though most of it goes out the window.     I think it is great that you admitted doing something even though you know that it is frowned upon by other parents. Most people won't admit their parenting downfalls.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	The mistake you're making here is that you think it gets sucked out, just cause YOU can't see it (which you wouldn't since you're supposed to be paying attention to the road, and if you don't check till after you're parked obviously it's not going to be there anymore) doesn't mean it's not there. My dad used to smoke (he quit a couple of years ago) and I remember sitting in the back seat behind my dad and everytime he smoked big puff of smoke in my face. Yes the windows were OPEN. No he was not going slow, it's usually on the highway going 65 mph when he did this.. PART of it gets sucked out, the other part goes in your kids faces. They're breathing it in and secondhand smoke is not only bad it's even worse than actually smoking.|`|gmaCvh00aa	I used to do the same thing, but as my daughter got older she started bugging me not to smoke around her, and what could I say?    She was right.  Now she is old enough to drive and we both use the same car, so I don't smoke in it at all.  You can learn to smoke less, even if you don't think you can fully quit or have the time to concentrate on quitting and be alone to deal with the withdrawal.  ****  Re your comment about it being your favorite time--I can relate.  It was very hard to learn to drive without a cigarette--it just seems so natural and since you are driving, you can enjoy the cig without anyone calling you over to do this or do that for them.|`|jLYTKr33aa	As the first person said, the only way all of the smoke would get sucked out is if you had your head out the window while driving.    Really, is getting your nicotine fix really more important than ensuring your child's health?  Can't you wait until you stop and get completely away from your child before you have a cigarette break?  I personally don't think it's worth the risk, but that's just me.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I too am a smoker but i don't smoke around my kids either... and especially not in the car.. I was told this once too, so i did my own test.    I smoked in the car. I had the window down, there was still the smoke i blowed into the car, and some that didn't go out the window... i made my own conclusion to not smoke in the car cuz the kids would be around it, sucks yes, i was just like you!     Once you have stopped doing it for awhile it will be normal, try chewing some gum at first when u usually do it in the car to keep your mind from it, that is what worked for me!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	It's still in there somehow.  I smoked in my car for years with the windows down...it still reeks (although when I was a smoker I couldn't smell it.)  And when I clean the inside of my windows, the paper towel is yellow.    I'm not trying to criticize you or anything, just stating my observations from my own vehicle.|`|zHRWklEWaa	My mom smokes while I'm in the backseat, the smoke does get back there even with the window open. The open window also sends a blast of freezing air to the backseat if you are in a cold area.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Here in Ontario Canada they are talking about banning smoking in cars with kids, and charging parents who do this.  Best not to take a chance about your kids breathing in second hand smoke in my opinion.|`|hThW3ioKaa	Ok first of all let me just say I don't smoke at all.     That being said, my husband smokes, my mother smokes, and brother smokes- all of which live with us and ride in the car with us on a daily basis sometimes. I have no problem with them smoking in car with the children as I was raised in a household in which my mother smoked around us constantly and I never had a problem with it and still grew up to be a non-smoker. (sorry if that offends people, but please, read on)   BUT- my husband, on the other hand, even though HE IS A SMOKER will NOT allow anyone to smoke around our children AT ALL- even in the car with the windows down! He makes everyone wait, including himself, until we stop somewhere or get where we are going to have a cigarette. Or if we are home, everyone has to go outside to smoke.   I am so happy with his decision, and I really have to applaud it because I didn't even enforce it, as the ONLY non-smoker in the house!     There have been so many studies done, and there are so many laws now..... the one user who said in LA it is unlawful to smoke in the car with children- that is a FACT.I used to live in New Orleans, and I know that to be true. They have these laws for a reason. PLEASE people... think of your children's health... it's really not that hard to just wait a few minutes to indulge! :)|`|PFO1jxZGaa	they did a study on thing called third hand smoke, where they studied the persons clothes and hair etc who smoked outside, then came inside and they found that the particles stuck to the clothing, hair etc, were still enough to make especially young kids sick.   Google it, 3rd hand smoke and see for yourself|`|AA10879713	I hate to tell you but second hand some is just as bad. No, even with the windows down, it does not all get sucked out. You kids are breathing in that crap that could cause them health problems down the road.|`|SIrmqu5maa	God, People on here act like they do everthing perfectly! Your kids will be okay. Its honestly not that serious.|`|mO7FOXNYaa	The smoke can still travel back there.    I can't explain the physics of it - but it's such a bad idea.    I know in Louisiana it is illegal to smoke in a car if any of the  passengers are children.    It's a law for a reason.|`|DsB0WLbsaa	As a smoker myself, I would NEVER EVER think of smoking in the car while my baby was in there with me.  I smoke in my car when hes NOT in the car with me, sure.    But personally, after having a cigarette and hopping into the backseat for something I can DEFINATELY smell it back there, no way does it all go out the window!|`|tfdQxfrpaa	It does not all get sucked out the window. My parents smoked with me in the car when I was a kid. So coming firsthand...It DOES NOT all get sucked out. You probably can't tell because you're so used to the smell, but I guarantee you that your children can tell. I definatley don't think you're a bad mother or anything of the sort for smoking, however, I do think you should take more precautions. I saw that you said it was yoru favorite time to smoke, you may need to give up smoking in the car with your kids just to ensure their safety. There's no reason they need to be inhaling the second hand fumes just because it's your addiction and favorite time. I hope that you will truely listen to the answers on here and consider it.|`|AA11185897	As a kid my mother smoked in the car, window down "sucking the smoke out." I hated it because she didn't believe us when we said we were still getting smoke back there.    kudos to you for being smart enough to not smoke in the house around them|`|cAtWxJG1aa	having been in the back of a car having an asthma attack when the driver was smoking with his window down, i can say with certainty that all the smoke is not going out the window.  i can pretty much guarantee that if a nonsmoker got in your car they would immediately notice the smell.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Its illegal in some states to smoke in cars with kids in them.  Probably for a reason.  The whole role model thing you got going on also.  And having them lose their mom to lung cancer doesnt help.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	It can't all be getting sucked out the window unless you are sticking your head out the window and holding the cigarette out there as well.  Can't you just wait until you stop somewhere to have a cigarette instead of smoking it in the car?|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	My dad used to smoke with us in the car (with the windows open) and it was still absolutely disgusting! I could still smell it and I was still breathing it in. And what happens when it gets cold and you're driving? Do you still open the windows? My dad would only crack them open in winter.    I hated that he smoked in the car and I'm so happy I'm an adult now and can control if he smokes in my car and I don't have to ride in his car anymore. You really can't wait to smoke until you're no longer driving?
jn34aSgHaa	listen its har when you need the money when you have a new born but you want to be there for oyur child i had a c-section you need to wait about 2 months. if you are not sure then ask your obgyn|`|HvALvdc7aa	Its been 7 weks since my c section and the incision is still open. So, I don't know.|`|FIALhwlKaa	In Germany you are not allowed to work 6 weeks after you have given birth. After that its your decision. If you feel good enough to go back to work, go for it, but dont let yourself down not to ask for child support from the father of your son. If you will do so now, you will never ask for anything. His situation might change one day.
jIk2ttH1aa	I love the name Giovanna.  (but you realize that if it's said as it's spelled it would be a hard G like the word GO?  GE o vanna.)  I think you want JEEOHVANNA but spelled Giovanna.    Juliette is very pretty.    Kellsie is way to overused as well as James.    Carter is OK.  And Patch is silly, it sounds like a clowns name.    My opinions only. :)|`|5sYzlAjPaa	i love Julliete (Juliette) and Kellsie (Kelsie)  Also love Audrey, Natalia and Kenley    Carter is okay, James is way too overused and i don't care for Patch - sounds too much like a nickname.    I love Elliot, Atticus, Colton, and Lawson.|`|U3Egv0y8aa	Kellsie and James|`|AXEqOEloaa	I like Julliete and James, the rest are not very nice especially Patch.|`|jU80mmJraa	Kellise and James    What do you think of Amari?|`|YqeatZB4aa	When picking out names you have to think about how the kids that they are going to school with are going to re-act to those names....kids can be mean sometimes. I like the names Carter and James not sure about Patch (James is my son's name) Julliete and Giovanna are a little out there, but they are cute...although with Julliete they could ask her where Romeo is...For girls I like Desarea, McKenzie.|`|hN9hH3YJaa	honey,don't even bother thinking up names for babies if you're not even pregnant yet. you'll change your mind hundreds of times until you finally decide. i'm still thinking of new names and my kids are all grown and i'm 72 years old!!!!!  hint: try yelling the kids name, as if you're calling them to dinner or are angry at them and see how you like the name then.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	Giovanna and James|`|6iJ30wugaa	Kellsie is o.k. but I do not like any of the boys names but thats me.|`|4TNavgDuaa	I like Julliete and Carter with the middle name James.  I have a Madison Elizabeth and if I ever have another girl I like Avalyn Noelle and for a boy Logan Alexander.|`|kUrbvJpoaa	Kellsie and Carter  Giovanni and Patch? WHY even bother with these names?
4D1VEKW5aa	The only time my tummy is hard is when the baby starts moving around. It probably feels mushy because you have more fat on top and cant really feel the baby underneath. Lay on you back and im sure youll be able to feel where its hard at. Im sure when youre a few more weeks youll be able to feel the baby move better.|`|gG8oyymiaa	Hunny count it as a blessing. I am 6 months and omg does my belly get in the way now. I have problems rolling over sitting sleeping bending over everything imaginable. I am dreading the next 4 months haha|`|AA11333930	Your stomach should be hard  My sisters stomach was "smushy" but at the same time if you touch it, it felt hard    Dont stress it that much  Im guessing is a boy.........alot of times women who are having a boy usually have stomach that are less round and look more like fat|`|Bxvs28oBaa	I am 28 weeks and my tummy is tiny.I am freaking out but doc didn't tell me that anything was wrong.I think we have to wait like untill 32 weeks to start noticing magor changes.Don't stress please coz my son feels me when I am angry.He kiks me very hard .|`|fE5zMOfJaa	You definitely don't look 6 months pregnant but everyone does carry different.  If you've been having regular visits to your dr & everything's been fine then there shouldn't be anything to worry about.  You could just ask your dr at your next visit just to ease your mind.|`|mCDopsLEaa	Well first I would like to say you carry your weight well to be 224. secondly, I had a pooch like that AFTER I had my 2nd and still haven't been able to get rid of it. If this is your first child and everything as far as measurements seem to be okay then I wouldn't be too concerned.|`|bsge5nZPaa	Everyone shows at different times in their pregnancy! Every woman is different just like every pregnancy is different!  I have been showing since I was like 13 weeks and my MIL kept telling me that it wasn't the baby that I was just getting fat!  And since you have a bigger structure you might not show until further along! My mom was 230 when she got pregnant with my brother, and she didn't show or anything until about 3 weeks before she had them!!    Congrats and good luck|`|u12eVaDhaa	You're fine, going along great.  Size of belly is no indicator of size of baby.  Your U/S scans must've been fine or the doctor would've told you.  If you are tall you will also develop less of a bump than shorter women, and be more comfortable.  Don't worry, you'll get a good big hard bump near the end and then you'll be desperate for your smushy one back!!!!  Best wishes|`|qH6ecSa3aa	Don't worry hun, you have 3 months to go and you never know you could blow up in those 3 months. My aunt barely showed by her 7th month and by the time she was 39weeks people were asking her if she was having twins! She was so mad! lol. You are truly blessed. I am 21weeks and even though I have only gained 2pounds, my body re-shaped itself and I just look fat. lol You look amazing don't be sad about it.|`|ke2SGcZDaa	My cousin didn't know she was pregnant and didn't notice that she hadn't gotten a period. She had a bigger structure and didn't really notice any weight gain. She ended up going to the hospital without any knowledge of being pregnant and he was born. :) So do not feel bad. This could be a good thing for you too. I have an enormous belly at 9 and a half months pregnant and I can hardly move to sleep, sit, walk, etc. I am over my due date and can hardly stand it anymore so maybe you'll get lucky. :) I really didn't start showing until the end of my fifth month anyway.|`|nGYa6gMUaa	You my not show, everyone is different. It depends on how big the baby is. The bigger the baby is the tighter your belly is.When my sister was pregnant she took until her 7th month to show. Half way through her 8th month before her stomach got harder. Your baby juts may not be that active yet. For the best answer, ask your doctor at your next ultrasound visit. I'm sure it's nothing to be concerned about but you should always ask just to be sure. Good luck and Congratulations!
5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	You'd have to tell me what each of your parent's eye colors are for me to predict eye color accurately. I'll go under the assumption that your mother had light eyes (blue, green, gray) and your dad had brown eyes:    You have a 50/50 chance of having a child with light eyes.    There's a 25% chance that the little girl will be a red-head, a 50% chance that she'll have hair similar in color to you and your husband, and a 25% chance that she'll be a darker brunette.     In any case, there's a 100% chance she'll be beautiful! :-)|`|LABC73E7aa	i think its possible that the red hair gene may jump in there. and green eyes.|`|c8cd0a03514fca61ce3fc331cc1dc6f1aa	There is absolutely no way to tell because there are too many variables.  If every one on both sides of the family had dark hair and brown eyes, then maybe you could guess correctly 95% of the time.  But I'm fairly certain you will have a red head eventually with or without green eyes (brown eyes are dominant).|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	Oh wouldn't red hair and green eyes be beautiful?!  This was always the fun part for me.      Here's how our two turned out with the given colorings:    I was blonde when I was younger, and it later turned brown.  Brown eyes.     My daughters father was dirty blonde with Hazel eyes    My mom was red hair with brown eye`s and dad brown.    My daughter has blonde hair with Blue eyes!  Only my cousin has blue eyes out of our two families.    so 6 years   later    My husband has brown hair and brown eyes    and our son came out with brown hair and brown eyes.    I hear brown eyes are dominant, but then how would my girl have bright blue?    There's no sure way to tell =0] With both of mine I wrote down what I thought they would look like, and I turned out to be right both times. Have fun day dreaming!
vsuXCMqzaa	I'm so sorry for you, I had the same thing. Sex was so painful during my pregnancy! I read that it is a combo of things. Harmones make you dryer and more swollen "down there", your cervix is more sensitive, your ligaments are stretching - it's a bunch of things.    What we did, when we did it, was use lots of lubrication. Also try a different position and also see if he is "easier" on you if that helps. My husband had to be very careful with me otherwise I would end up curled in a ball afterwards like what you wrote.     Also, make sure you keep communcation open between you. Let him know what's going on and that it's not him, but a normal pregnancy thing. You may have to do "other things" besides intercourse if it gets too bad. My husband and I didn't have much sex while I was pregnant, but it all resolved itself in the end. He was very understanding once he knew what was happening and your guy will probably be too.|`|WaU0hmD5aa	i would talk to your dr. about b/c i don't know what that could be and restrain from sex until you find out b/c you don't want to jeopardized your baby life and may God bless you|`|eFQgVjTjaa	I would ef speak to your doc next visit, but for the most part your uterus is a muscle and just like any muscle ig gets soar from stretching and working it.  Its possible its just because of the uterus growing, or ligament pain, but I wouls still bring it up to the doc.  Pain during sex can be from an infection like bacterial vagenosis which is the most common infection during pregnancy.  I still have pain after intercourse. also an orgasm contracts your uterus.  it could be from the orgasm itself|`|HQ5R1p9qaa	where is the pain? when i had sex early in my pregnancy i had pain in my lower stomach after and nothing has gone wrong or anything and i'm 39 weeks along. its normal to feel some pain and discomfort early in a pregnancy any way i think|`|F2JEvYX7aa	do you maybe have a infections or a strained muscle? The best thing for you to do would be to go see your doctor.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I would ask your doctor to make sure but once I became pregnant sex became very painful and still is at 33 weeks pregnant, my midwife said it was normal.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I am not sure but I would call your doc and ask.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I dunno whats going on. It could be a few different things. Pregnancy can make sex uncomfortable, but I doubt thats why you are in alot of pain. Pain during sex can be indicators of infections and stuff like that. I would recommend maybe going to the doctor and finding out whats going on. If you think theres a possibility for pregnancy test for that also. Round ligament pain usually you feel in your lower stomach pelvic region and its just like a shooting, pulling pain occasionally. good luck|`|joPJtKemaa	My doc said limited to no sexual activity in the beginning of the first trimester. Only when he okayed it then we went ahead with it.      Just be careful, speak to your doctor. This early, anything painful can lead to a miscarriage.
bsge5nZPaa	It is perfectly safe to take warm baths all throughout your pregnancy!! You just don't want HOT baths or anything that can cause your body temperature to reach 101!  I am 39 weeks and 4 days pregnant and still take warm baths (with my husband having to help get me out! ha)|`|FjGeKhY0aa	I think it applies throughout the pregnancy. You're not suppose to take hot baths at all, maybe a short warm bath will be ok but if your body temperature goes up it isn't good for a baby.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	Yes you can take a bath, just make sure that the water is not too hot (over 90 degrees). You can bath and even swim anytime during your pregnancy.|`|m0a7Ox1maa	that such an old wives tale - it's safe to swim, bath and have sex literally up till you give birth|`|IjcdwJiMaa	a warm bath is fine threw all of ur pregnancy, just not hot water, have fun!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My Dr actually suggested that I take baths at times because I had such horrible back pain so ya it's safe. Just be careful getting back up!!|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	You can take a bath just so it is not too hot.   http://www.babycenter.com/406_is-it-safe...|`|17MZkNpZaa	i wouldn't do it. its too risky|`|joPJtKemaa	Make sure the water is not hot at all.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	You can take baths in you pregnancy from day 1 to week 40 as long as you can get your self in and out of the tub. Its after a c-section that it can be a problem with the stitches and stuff|`|Tv8MjT7kaa	you don't want to take HOT baths.  I would go for a bit warmer than luke warm.  It doesn't matter what trimerster you are in, a hot bath is not a good idea.|`|eya1WDS4aa	YES you can. Just make sure its not to hot and take a thermometer with you and check your temp every five minutes and make sure you body temp doesn't get above 100.5|`|LABC73E7aa	i take baths all the time. my doctor never warned me against it. just make sure ur not cooking urself in the bath and be brief dont soak for hours. also tape your toe to the toe next to it. it will help with your walking. i hurt my toes all the time.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	It's safe to take a warm bath at ANY time during your pregnancy. It's just an old wives tale... if you want to reassure yourself you can also call and ask your docotor!
RLbN2Ujhaa	Yes, BUT you have to find the instructions to clear out the data of the person who used it before or it will prompt you to use test sticks based on their cycle. I gave my monitor to my SIL and also instructions on how to clear it, b/c removing the batteries doesn't do it. (Pressing the "M" alone won't do it b/c if the person before had long cycles with late ovulation, it still might not ask you to use a stick until like day 16, which might be after YOU ovulate.)|`|TXsEZPBMaa	i wouldn't trust it if the instructions don't say anything about being re-usable.|`|klsZLzYBaa	Take the batteries out and I think there is a reset button where the batteries go, I read it some where and it can be re-used, just press the M when you have when you next start your cycle|`|Faw2iBtfaa	You can use a used monitor as long as you reset it and make sure to properly clean it.

bql2RJzWaa	Just say it. When I told my mom, she was proud, lol. She was like, "My baby is growing up!" It was embarrassing at first ('cause she made sure to tell my step-dad). But, looking back at it (I'm 27 now), it was fine.|`|CnlSbPsuaa	Just tell her lolz, I told mine and she was happy and took me out and bought me a new bag for 'becoming a woman' lol so yeah it's nothing to worry about x|`|X6as2nOAaa	When I got mine I ran upstairs and said mom guess what, and she was like what I said I got my period!!!!

3aqm1SDbaa	You may want to go to the doctor, you could be going into early labor.

The pressure could be a sign that the baby is on its way but i would still get it checked out as you are still quite early to go in to labour.|`|qH6ecSa3aa	Did you lose your mucus plug?

X8LNbaKQaa	Closer to A than B.  I have to align the top sheet and blankets and make sure they are all lined up neatly, or it keeps me awake to be under chaos.    But then, I am an engineer.  Think grid paper.    --   Regards,      John Popelish|`|3gXQPso5aa	A) my man in a neat freak! lol|`|h8l1H4N4aa	B -  but with a fitted sheet.  My  husband and I both have our own top sheet and blankets because he's twice my size and one good turn on his part takes ALL the blankets off of me.  We've had this arrangement since the second day of marriage.  It's messy because nobody else can see the room anyway and there's too many different kinds of blankets to arrange neatly.    Otherwise, the rest of my house is in the A group.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	B|`|wBpennsMaa	a.|`|w7G3PVIuaa	B i don't think it's worth making if you're just going to sleep in it again in 12 hours, plus i'll sit down on it so it messes it up a little anway|`|O8Kf27TSaa	B. but I'm in the middle It matches and I have it fitted.

Ww8nQ7rqaa	A. i have matching sheet sets, but only occaisionally make my bed.|`|UxMugqdraa	i'm     B) You don't have a fitted sheet or the top sheet or you are missing one. Your bed has a bunch of random blankets or the blankets on your bed are never tucked in right and all over the place. Nothing really matches.|`|okpAjss6aa	B i role alot when i sleep so there is no point in makeingall need.|`|zAKFuGGiaa	I'm more B than A, although I do make my bed every morning... I don't have a top sheet, only a fitted one, it's red and flannel and it's soft and I love it. I have a black comforter and two pillows in black cases (but they don't actually match the comforter...) I also have a leopard print body pillow and a few throw pillows! I don't tuck my sheet in (because it's fitted) and I don't tuck my comforter in either. Most of the time I actually sleep on top of the comforter and under a small microsuede down comforter that I have had for years and am in love with! (It's pink and orange and totally doesn't match anything else I own!) I also have my daughter's disney princess fleece blanket on my bed for the nights when It's a little too cool for just my blanket but still too warm for the big comforter!|`|EsaFg8eaaa	B I kick off the blankets and sheets, I gave up on my bed awhile ago|`|A5sjOsrDaa	im kinda in between. i have my fitted sheet and my top sheet, then a blanket, then another blanket then my comforter. my sheets are tucked in but they dont have to be perfect. they never stay that way anyway.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Uhhmm a combination of both.

XD (most of which do not line up) one orange, 1 pink, 1 blue plaid, 1 purple, 1 tiger patterned  4th - comforter - flowers   5th - comforter - wolf   and then my head pillows (1/2 way dangling off the bed, if i change it i won't be able to sleep though!)  and then my blanket - dogs       :D|`|ZAppRn5Faa	haha trolll. why are you asking this??|`|AA10673927	I'm actually a little bit of both.  (:|`|Bqtx3CTYaa	well i put a pink bottom sheet on then i put my pink quilt cover on which i am sooo bad at i have to climb in the quilt cover usually resulting in my dad fastening the top of the quilt so im trapped its funny lol then i put my pillow cases on and then lie out on the bed shattered im sure that it must burn like 1 million cals making the bed lol i hate doing it  x|`|AA11348344	C. Has a California king water bed, But the sheets are too small.    Hahahah you knew me too well.|`|HFA05vDuaa	im kinda in the middle. all of my sheets match along with my comforter but i do have a blacket that clashes very much. i also never make my bed and i use as many pillows as i need|`|rULYGvz9aa	B. :P|`|7woJQ5HTaa	both....................................... snowed outside!!! I luv snow!!! and rainbows!!!|`|ufTjv25Jaa	I'm a bit of both. Okay, bed-description lol:    I have a fitted sheet and the top sheet, but the top sheet isn't really like tucked in, it's all messy. I sleep with 3 pillows, all on different angles, and i just have one doona atm (coz it's friggin 43 degrees Celsius here in Australia) I have heaps of random cushions and stuffed animals on my bed. I don't make my bed, its always in a big heap; the way i like it :D    EDIT: Oh i always have matching sheets. Atm they are blue checkered things ;P And my doona cover atm is like white with these random flowers on it.|`|owpjHPOxaa	B.  I don't sleep in my bed a lot.. I usually fall asleep on my desk, so yeah.    can I ask why you are asking this? lol, its a tad random...|`|rs7GKJTQaa	i'm somewhat b and a =]|`|ryPwRM0Eaa	My sheets match my comferter, but the blanket doesnt match. The pillows match. usualy my beds a mess!|`|nZRZvsszaa	I'm a combination.   I have matching sheets and comforter. But the thing that goes on my mattress is slipping off... my pillows are not really that neatly put together. And my comforter and sheet are rumpled from where I got out of bed....
dnGJ5JLgaa	Tegan is a pretty name and it is unique.  You won't hear that name often.  If you are not sure about Tegan... there is also similar names to it:    Keegan  Reagan      I love the name Caden.  You can spell it Kaden or Caeden or Kaeden or Kadyn or Cadyn.  But I like the way you spelt it.    If you also like Caden... maybe you will like Cade?    hope i helped!|`|UzkHnXzVaa	I don't like Tegan, sorry. Caden is alright. It's your decision though. :)  Since you like Caden, what about Caydence for a girl's name?|`|6hDnMQpoaa	Aww, I love both!|`|6pevwBizaa	I agree with you - I don't like Tegan at all. It kinda sounds like it should be a food company... (no offense to anyone reading this whose name might be Tegan).     I love Caden tho.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Caden is made up and trendy and Tegan is a boys name.    So I don't like either    keep looking :)|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I love the name Tegan for a girl. I also really like Caden, but i think it is becoming ultra popular.|`|jU80mmJraa	tegans ok but i love the name Caden|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I love Caden even though its REALLY popular!    Tegan is ok but I'm not sure on the spelling. It makes it look like it should be pronounced Teh-gin instead of Tee-gin
UVQrNF3daa	i hear dizziness is normal during pregnancy.. (i am currently waiting to find out if im preggo, period should have started monday)  But i have had dizziness which is nothing like that!  The hot head and racing heart i get when im about to have a panic attack!  it becomes hard to breath and my heart races and my head starts sweating!  i would see a dr though.. it could be blood pressure problems, which happens in pregnancy too!|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	I would call the doctor if I were you.  It doesn't sound totally normal so I would just double check with the doc before you get yourself stressed out.|`|AA11763588	It can be one of two things, either your BP is low, try drinking some OJ before doing the housework.    Or you are dehydrated, you'll need to take in more fluids.|`|iq5uwobOaa	It could be your blood pressure.  I would have that checked out.    I would take more breaks and drink lots of water and make sure you are eating and your blood sugar is ok.|`|1whTwTbDaa	This is very normal. When we stand up, our blood pressure drops...and during pregnancy it drops even lower. Now, the heat isn't good for anyone, but being pregnant you should try to avoid it as much as possible. It will make you more dizzy than normal. But your doing fine. Keep yourself well hydrated, and try to rest before you get your heart rate up to high. Your pregnant...its always normal to have concerns, but if you get too scared, call your doctor. Good luck.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Ive had this happen to me lately.  I don't feel hot though.  I did have higher blood pressure at my last check-up.  I'll get it checked again next week.  Take it easy until you find out why this happens to you.
3f74302012c84dd758e7a49de2208a0baa	It really depends on the district. Where I live now, it doesn't matter if your kid's mastered astrophysics, she's not getting into kindergarten if her birthday's after the cutoff.    I missed the cutoff by 10 days. I remember taking some tests, and I know my parents had several meetings with the school before they'd admit me. The school fought it pretty hard. I would have been bored to death staying put another year, and I was definitely ready to learn ... but there were some definite social disadvantages. I was a small kid and a late bloomer, so most of my friends treated me more like a younger sister than a peer, and junior high was pretty rough. On the up side, I did great academically, got an early start on college and life in general and was always a little proud of myself for it.|`|AA11481224	where i live you would be out of luck   advanced kids go in at 5 just like the rest    cal the district office in your area and ask them but you are most likely going to have to wait a year until she is 5 they have age requirements for a reason      look into pre k     she may be  smart and all but she could very well be lacking socially|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Its going to completely depend on your school district.    You also didnt say why you wanted her to go early - some parents even do simply for free care.    Although some kid spilled the beans to my kid, that you go to kindergarten when your 5.  Totally ruining my red-shirt plan for him, late summer b-day.  Im with the above poster, and keeping them a kid as long as possible -while challenging them of course.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I think that the child has to be gifted to be able to go early.  I think the cons outweigh the pros.  If your child is not socially or academically ready, they're going to end up being held back eventually anyway.  Then you will feel like it's your fault.      Kids grow up so fast it's disgusting.  ESPECIALLY when they start going to school.  The time starts flying by.  I'd love to keep my child home an extra year if I could.
3WWHWsHOaa	Yep I do. I especially like her now that I no longer speak to her, see her, or have to deal with her.|`|irGE84Qdaa	lolz i dont like her she hates me i hate her.i kno she is never gonna love me and i kno i wont love her either i use to respect her alot but she dont deserve it so......what goes arround comes arround.|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	we get a long for short periods of time, although we have our moments but we both suck it up and be adults about it for my husband and our daughter    good luck!!!|`|G6h7mjdpaa	Yes I do. We get along great. She drives me up the wall sometimes but I'm sure I do the same to her!|`|RHEcNYn6aa	Not really, i don't hate her to the point where i won't look at her, I just don't approve of her judging me, oops, don't wanna get into that!|`|3dxwK9v3aa	Wow, it unfortunate that everyone hates their mother-in-law. I am going to be the odd one out here, I guess. Yes, I love her. She's great...a little eccentric but very kind!|`|v1IzWlqQaa	I like my mother in law...But she is still a B****!! She likes to start sh*t between me and my husband. And She likes to talk about my mom. So Its been hard to forgive her and I Have. I will be the bigger person and I use Kindness as my weapon.|`|cEgI5ogLaa	Yes but she drives me crazy sometimes :)  I think that's their job, when you become a MIL you have to learn how to press every single button a person has! lol. We do get along really well though, and she loves me like a daughter (she drives everyone crazy, not just me!) so I can't complain about her knowing how much she loves me and welcomed me into the family the way she did. I think with a little effort anyone can find a way to get along, just depends how much effort both people want to put in it.  Toni Lynne|`|POHWTDPRaa	I can take her or leave her|`|3TdT5mG2aa	I am not married but I thought I would comment. My ex-boyfriend, who I loved with all my heart, did not have a mother.

We do NOT get along at all.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	I might as well not have one, she`s mentally challenged.Although she`s mildly affected, it`s hard to keep a conversation with her.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I like her. I have really nothing against her. We dont see eye to eye on some things and I do complain about her to my friends but I would not say I dont like her... I dont love her and I'm happy she lives a plain ride away but yeah, I guess I like her.. I mean she is family and I think family should at least try to get along and be in civil terms.. even if you disagree on things|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Unfortunately I don't have one, she died when he was 10...but she taught him well. He's the best cook and house cleaner out there. :) I do however have a FIL...and he's the worst there is.|`|sEihaeLNaa	Hell no that B*tch can rot in hell for all i care!!! She is the biggest whore I know and does not apreciate me even though i took her 5 kids in (cps took them away) after i had only been married for a month! She made up all kinds of stories about me to evryone just b cuz she was jelouse cuz i took care of her kids better than she ever did and will!!!   I HATE MY MOTHER IN LAW|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Yes, very much - she treats me like I'm her own daughter.|`|h5Bf33ieaa	no i dont like her!!!|`|c55O7jqXaa	Yes I love my Mother in law. I always have.

qLkMSEBwaa	Before Paris Hilton was even born, There was this character called Barbie.  All little girls was trying to be like this "made up character"  I just think Paris never grew out of it.  Most little girls like makeup, purses, and throwing on all their mom's dress clothes and heels way too big for their little feet to play dress up..But, that doesn't mean, as a parent you let you young child go out like that.  Also, I know for a fact, even strict parents who forbid the girls to dress like this, sneak out and do it anyway and then take it off before they come home.  What makes me sick is the parents who to me is actually prostituting their little girls by dressing them up with more make up on than I wear in a month..for beauty pageants, auditions, Anything for financial gain.  To me they are sell outs for their kids and is in a way prostituting their own child!!!  Look at little Jon Benet Ramsey.  A small little girl, dressed and so help me had hair, makeup, clothes that made her look like a grown woman.  A damn pedophiles dream--which makes me sick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Also, look at the underage teenager-preacher's daughter dancing and Akon got in serious trouble over it.  NO young girl her age dances like that and is innocent!!!!!! Also, how in the hell is he suppose to know how old she is when she looks over 18, dances over 18, and is in a place where underage kids should NOT be allowed in.  I'm not saying what Akon did was right, but the girl was up there dressed like a whore, dancing like a whore, and looked like a consenting adult whore!!!!!!!!  I don't know if her parents allowed her to dress this way, but she had tattoos as well.  How in the hell could they NOT know their so called innocent little girl was doing this BS????????  Now, we have Miley Cyrus who is dating a man way too old for her who is a damn underwear model, and she is licking her lips like a whore, and taking very Provocative photos.  Her parents see NOTHING wrong with this!!!!!!!!!  As long as she's bring home the money for them to pimp her out-they don't care!!!!!!!!!!!!  Bash me all you want..the facts are true and the truth are facts...Like it or not!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|B52KNW7Haa	I am more irritated at the mothers for allowing it.  I also love to see prom dresses that barely cover the girl only to find out it was designed by the mother.    Sheesh.|`|r5AbT6tmaa	Children with cell phones.|`|AA11895525	My daughter who will be six years old this Sunday LOVES purses, but her idea of a purse is something plastic with princesses on it.  She's has learned from me that purses are something to carry your keys, chapstick, sun glasses and money in and that's what's in hers.  Now I'm also mean and won't let her wear Hannah Montana logo clothing, things that have clevage or show her belly button or the pants where her butt hangs out.  She knows that she won't have a boyfriend until she's 16 yrs old and doesn't even want one.  I wish that more parents would let their kids be themselves!  My daughter has her own fashion sense (and yes it kills me at times!) and I give her clothing choices when we buy them and then let her mix and match as she wants.  She doesn't want to be Hannah Montana she wants to be herself!!  As for a cell phone HECK NO not until she can drive!!|`|vBPTS1TOaa	The lack of attention some parents pay to their kids.    Being a high school teacher, at parents night in December, some parents didn't even know what class their child was in !! And it was at least more than 5 set of parents. It's not back breaking work to take part in your child's education.     When I was doing work experience at a middle school, the girls in that class were unreal. 10 & 11 years old ...  handbags by their desk, the air head laugh, mini skirts, make-up, lip gloss ..... It's just not right. I caught a few of the ''cool'' ones making out in the halls on more than one occasion ... and seemed please when they got caught. It's not their fault either, nor the parents to a certain extent .... media ... and glamorizing is the problem ....|`|69bp1IMfaa	I thank God there's one person who has some sense in their head. These girls are being spoiled, their parents are trash, and they let their children act like little whores.|`|prqrQcd1aa	This goes along with my thoughts on what some parents are willing to let their little girl wear! A few years ago a friend of mine and i were at wal mart, she saw a short set that consisted of a halter top and some short shorts that had ribbons going up the sides..no fabric there, just the ribbons..so skin would be showing. I looked her dead in the eyes and told her, "put her in something like that now, and don't be supirzed when she comes to you at 15 saying she is pregnant" I'm tired of the media, other mom's, and society thinking it's okay for little girls and teenagers wearing clothes that a grown woman could wear on a night out in town...or worse yet, at a strip club! Maybe if more people would think like this we would have less teenage mothers. Yes, i do believe this has part to do with the teenage mother epidemic going on... That and lack of parenting!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I love the whats in your purse videos on Youtube, and its really scary to see like, kids, basically being, all  "like ok, erm, omg, this is like my Gucci bag, and like, I have all this make up in, it and like, yeah"  Its depressing to see little girls trying to grow up so fast|`|nfzQkvqraa	I think purses are fine.  I think it's okay to be girly.  I don't think it's okay to model yourself after someone like Paris Hilton.  Especially if your 10 years old.    My daughter carries a purse around from time to time.  It has chap stick in it and some loose change and a few little toys.  (she's 7)|`|sBHhnDwaaa	I had a purse at 9/10 for my pads. My whole family (extended included) starts menstruation early.    What irritates me is people assume stuff about other kids and why they have what they have. At 13 I had a cell phone. I always paid my bill, and DID need it because of after school activities that ending times varied from meeting to meeting.
7BctZ6Zmaa	Yes it can give him allergies. and cat litter is very very bad for babies. and it is better to get a profesional to clean it|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Ew, cat poop everywhere?  Gross.      In this case I would have a professional carpet cleaner come in and clean the carpets (The owner should actually do this since you are renting, it really should not be something you should have to pay for, I would ask the owner to please have the carpets professionally cleaned due to the animals that were living there).    Otherwise, normal, healthy cats are fine, I have 3 of them but I vacuum often and they are healthy.  If there is cat poop everywhere then chances are they aren't taken care of well so I would do major cleaning.|`|S7VJ1GDdaa	As far as a cat living with the baby, that isn't bad. It is an old wives tale that cats steal babies breath. What it is, is they want to get close to the heat source i.e. babies mouth. Anyway, on the cleaning part I would have a professional come in the first time so that they do not miss any spots of a cat hair, etc...If you cannot afford it, have your husband and some friends go in and do the best job possible. I would also spray some Lysol or other air sanitizer before bringing the baby in. Good Luck|`|pXSKSS3daa	Well, if cat hair(and cats in general) were bad for babies my son would have so many problems by now. Cats aren't bad. I keep my house clean as much as possible.    If you have one use a shampooer on the carpets, or rent one if you don't. Many times you can use carpet cleaner specifically designed for pets. We also use a spray called Nature's Miracle and it works really well when our dog's had an accident on the floor.     Clean the carpeting really well and then leave some windows open(if you can) to help ventilate the area. After you clean it use some carpet deodorizer and then vacuum that up.

Yeah so some celebrity did it..so what. That doesn't make it all the sudden some trendy thing to do. No matter how cool the person is who named their kid that, its still really dumb. The poor kid would be teased their whole childhood and its just a really dumb name. Just my opinion.|`|AwOQyYXqaa	if you want your kid to come home beating up every day go ahead thanks for the 2 points|`|Ox2ojFCHaa	I personally would not recommend naming your kid Blanket, it would give other children a reason to make fun of him. I suggest you look up more common names. And if you have a wanting for a unique name, go with a real name, not a comfort item.|`|I1wwpx69aa	why would you name him/her that?!!?...answer: no. ...he would get teased so much!|`|J5V9dvm8aa	sure, why not?  You can name your kid whatever you like.|`|wwUAUU48aa	dude.. the poor kid will have to deal with all its school friends making fun of it.. i wouldnt..   hah but its funny :P|`|Xk9uXoW4aa	um... no!!!|`|i2yM0T9Paa	Ok Michael Jackson.|`|j2qrOjo1aa	fleece blanket jr.|`|6rhiR5tBaa	Sure!

If so I'm so sorry if you name them Blanket. How about Apple or Ginormous!? No Wait, how about Breathe! Yeah that is good. Come on. Seriously wake up.|`|L3UIGV29aa	yea! ur settin ur kid up 4 future bullying target|`|Sr8iY1FNaa	No, I would suggest Down Comforter instead.............Geez who comes up with these questions????????|`|b25a74469233f38d4ab50bb09a3c6f0caa	TRY NOT TO, it will be ridiculed in school as he grows, however if that name has some sort of a speacial meaning to you, maybe a middle name???|`|xK0wN8Pvaa	NO!!!!! Think about calling for him/her Blanket, Blanket! Where are you Blanket!? It is just NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|vlwzVbbBaa	Uh let me think about that, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...|`|jziCVIGuaa	omg no do not torture him like that. Plus isn't that michael Jackson's kids name?|`|rDnLG0haaa	Sure go ahead,    I think its a lovley name next to pillow.  What a classic!|`|IN6weFmlaa	don't listen to those people. that is up to you. i like the name blanket for a girl or boy it doesn't matter. I like the name blake for a girl. and i don't care what anyone else thinks it's not my problem.you can't help that. so i would say,name him what you want!!! it's a FREE country.
9ZpsGMhjaa	I used to go to bed around 1 in the morning and i would be exhausted at school  I tried cuting off an hour until i got to ten to see if i felt energized in the morning and there wasn't much improvment.   Once i was still tired from going to bed at 10 i started cutting off 10 minutes every night and right now i turn off my tv around 915 and wake up at 6 10|`|1SeUmu8Naa	everyone is different :)   im 16 an im at school tomorrow and it is now 2.10am it just depends on how much sleep the indivual will need :) but on average most of us go about 12 :D|`|hOEIFpl5aa	im almost 15 and i go to sleep at like 10-11. but i usually go to bed at 10-10:30.|`|tecPZUq2aa	Im 16.

Times have changed and parents are more laid back these days. I would say you need at least 8 hours of sleep a night. It helps you concentrate at school. Im 30 and my daughters are 10 and nearly 8. They have to be asleep by 9pm latest only because I let them lie in until 8am as we are not far from school. If they had to travel far to school they would be going to bed by 8:pm latest.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Depends what I'm doing, I'm trying to do my personal statement for college, if I wasn't I'd probably be in bed by now.

(I'm 16)|`|owpjHPOxaa	Am I shallow or what?  it depends on what I'm doind with my hair the next day.  hahahaha.    Anywhere from 9pm (that's early morning sports though, so i get up around 4)  to 12 (if i'm gonna sleep in a little)    as long as you get the right amount of sleep for you it's fine, since i don't need a lot of sleep to function normally i don't sleep too much.  if when your going to bed now doesn't affect grades etc don't worry too much about it : )|`|WOdsVfiXaa	I'm 14 and I go to bed in the early hours of the morning and get up at 7.15, I know it's bad, I just don't see the point in sleeping for ages.

Some people are used to not having a lot of sleep because of habits but others aren't. Generally, an average person should have 8 hours of sleep. I usually go to bed at 10:30 and wake up at 7 all the time, including holidays. That way my routine doesn't get messed up but I know people who go to sleep at 2 or 3 in the morning which is unhealthy. 11 isn't too late as long as you get up at around 8-9. Otherwise try to get to bed earlier, it really helps you concentrate for the next day! :D|`|ZAgznf6Baa	honey, you don't go to sleep late. My school piles on so much work that I'm usually up until 1 or 2...earliest is 11|`|cIROBuszaa	I'm almost sixteen.  My bed time is at 10.   I guess it depends. If you aren't sleepy in the mornings and doing well in school, stay at the 11;00 time.  But if you are sleepy and can't get up. You might want to sleep earlier.|`|MhMajHXKaa	well I admit I'm 14 near 15 tho. I go bed at 9 XD however having an iPod touch and a wireless router I stay up from 11-01 :p

It looks like an ad I would respond to. I like it. But also a suggestion. I'm low income and I would look for a place that takes like daycare vouchers.

So if she takes those that should definitly be on there.|`|i4gz2IAtaa	I think its reasonable  I'd check it out|`|6uRWoIjJaa	Don't put address! or road due to child protection!

930fe73b33732f29f1d90a326d6ddf17aa	Es lo que yo digo. Qu se supone que contestemos a esas preguntas. Es decir, vayan al gineclogo no? Obviamente Yahoo Respuestas no se hizo para contestar esas cosas. Es preocupante la cantidad de chicas que preguntan eso.     No me gustan las preguntas que hacen aqu que son demasiado personales. Me parece que cada uno tiene que tener respeto por su vida privada y no puede estar ventilndola por un medio tan impersonal como este. Los consejos sobre problemas muy personales deben pedirse a la gente con la que de verdad contamos. Esas preguntas en la que la gente cuenta su vida sexual, sus relaciones de pareja, sus problemas ms ntimos, slo demuestran inmadurez por parte de quien las formula, y hacen pensar que en realidad no le dan importancia a sus cosas y dejan que un montn de extra?os opinen y se metan en sus vidas privadas, adems muchas veces de forma muy burda y sin el menor respeto.|`|aa58d0abfa5923c859a130cd285b2583aa	en principio y yo estoy en el grupo de que en nuestra edad de adolescentes en las escuekas y colegios el tema este   bueno ,ahorqa gracias adios hay mas imformacion  debieraq haberla en las clases de primaria cuando los profesionales de la educacion  lo vieren oportuno ir educando y respondiendo a las dudas y demas sobre el  tema y formar a los futuros padres madres en una correcta y amplia educacion  sobre el tema y asi no habria tantas sorpresas  ,si una  mujer  quiere saber si esta enbarazada prinero que piense si ha habido motibos para ello y despues que vaya auna farmacia pida le tes de embarazo y despues decida  que  es muy facil dale que te pego sin precauciones  pero despues viene las lamentaciones  pues le marcha atra tambien se usa aunque algunos  acelerador a fondo y despues   hay ssi que prevenir  goma  ,goma y en caso de no tener  marcah atras y sino con la vecina para no dejar embarazada a l propia  que facil resultra predicar cuando a uno no le duelen las muelas  lo jodio es cuando a uno le toca|`|5edd9cc404930ce2a90e04fb89e50fb3aa	POR QUE HAY MUCHAS VECES EN QUE SE ACTUA CON IMPULSIVIDAD, Y NO SE TIENE TIEMPO PARA PENSAR EN UN ANTICONCEPTIVO.|`|23077a0ec40d843d329d0fa51ff9ea90aa	Para mi tambin es molesto el leer tantas preguntas igualitas, el problema es (como ya todos lo mencionaron):    1.- Les da pena ir a la farmacia a comprar una prueba de embarazo o ir al laboratorio a hacercela.  2.- Creen que si TODOS les decimos "No ests embarazada" se har realidad.  3.- No quieren usar mtodos anticonceptivos!!!

vJEatJFPaa	Normal    I suggest trying Oatmeal cereal instead..tastes better and isn't so constipating.....    Try offering an extra 1/2 to 1 ounce of water during a feeding to help with hard poops.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I had the same problem and lucky for me she drank the 2 oz of water I offered her...then I took her off the rice and tried barley because the barley has more fibre content in it and she hasn't been constipated since I took her off the rice ( she was on it for 4 days and the last day I had had enough!)    Sugar is a bad idea, you could possibly get some juice in the baby isle that has no perservitives and no sugar added to them and try that|`|h5Bf33ieaa	did you know that babies does not need water? because the milk and the fruit has plenty of water ! do not give her water with sugar is bad for her teeth but try a little water maybe on a spoon.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	same with isabel. the pedi told me to buy baby juice, prune mixed with apple juice. don't put sugar in the water or milk... just go buy some BABY juice....

Try adding a little babyfood fruit to it, like apple puree, or prune puree.  Fruits are natural laxatives.  Or mix the cereal with breast milk (or formula) instead of water, which they find yummy.
iUFIlbNgaa	it is very bad for you to make yourself throw up.  You often times aren't getting enough nutrients from the food that you eat, and, if continuing this behavior, could end up with heart burn due to stomach acid.  Often times people who do this to get skinny are actually the perfect weight for their height (your BMI).  if you have anymore questions on health, then go to www.webmd.com|`|XSmkmwohaa	What do you think? Of course its bad for you.|`|jHHMSTmEaa	oh its a VERY bad idea. not only is it unhealthy but the acid from your tummy can cause your teeth to rot and fall out. And thats way harder to fix than losing weight. If you really want to lose weight cut out all junk food and bread and take a walk after dinner every day. trust me it works! be healthy and happy! also talk to your parents about letting you join a gym. Its way more fun to lose the weight if you go to a class or swim.|`|8v40KEd0aa	Please do talk to someone. Because it could become a habit and yes it would be very bad for you.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	Oh, it is bad for you and you really should seek out some help.  Do you know where to go?  Can you talk to your Mom or Dad? Is there a school counselor you know or a teacher you trust?  No boy is worth hurting yourself over, and that is what you are doing.
T6nmD3X9aa	I was crazy when I had to leave my daughter over night with my mom the first few times. I would call at weird hours just to know if she did anything and if she seemed like she missed me (even though she was way to young to show any big signs, she was like 7 weeks!!)  Its ok, just try to enjoy this break, have a romantic night out (or night in) with your husband, sleep in, catch up on everything you need to! This will help you out sooo much!!! Call over there as much as you want, trust me, all parents understand this and even expect it!    Good luck (and get some rest!)|`|dXVA1wHDaa	The first time I left my son (with my mum) I was txting every half hour-45 mins to check on him!  Even after she'd told me he'd been bathed and put to bed and no peep from him!  Now I'm not so bad, mainly because I will only leave him with my mum and she knows his routine almost as well as I do!    I can't/won't leave him with anyone else just yet, too neurotic!  He's 4 months old now, so he's not that old yet.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I barely ever have anyone babysit my 13 month old.  hes been away from me all night only 3 times. and i dont even remember the last time i had a sitter.    So your not alone.|`|jHHMSTmEaa	oh yes!!lol My mom actually offered to come stay over at my home a couple of nights a week to take care of my baby at  night....but i cant stand the thought of her waking up without me comforting her! We are are own worst enemy! Maybe we will sleep good when they are at college! (PROBABLY NOT!!)lol|`|qGQCLFinaa	for me, i couldn't win either way, i'd get stressed out, my son has a strong personality & is quite the handful at times, but he's only been away less then 5 times his whole life, because i'd rather find a way to relieve my stress, or let my fiance watch him while i take a nap or a long hot shower, i'm more of a basket case when he's gone, and i don't know what to do with myself!! My fiance takes him off my hands as often as he can, sometimes he can take our son with him when he's working (he plows snow in the winter) so that helps a lot.... but i think you're normal to feel that way! you're lucky to have nice inlaws who want to help! Mine are awesome too, but my mother in law has bad heart conditions & my son is too hyper for her to handle on her own!|`|xZWP2mqjaa	Obviously, from reading this you find it difficult, but the 1st time is the hardest. Have you tried letting him stay 1 nite at their house without you there? You will cry like a baby - the 1st time - BUT it does get easier. My son spends at least 1 nite a week with my parents and has done since he was a baby. i don't use babysitters, i prefer him to be with family.  OR if this idea is just too much to entertain, what about if you go and sleep at m-i-l's while your husband stays home with baby (I assume your parents aren't nearby, thats why you go to the in-laws). your m-i-l could always go and sleep at yours in the spare room while you kip at theirs.   Just ideas to try and help you get some sleep.  EDIT: just read your additional notes. I thought you were close with ur in-laws, thats why you slept over there. I dont blame you for not relaxing when he's with his mum. Mine's the same. I trust my mam completely, but his mam? She's alaw unto herself, thinks she can do what she likes with MY child...and wont be told that she's wrong. in fact his whole family think they can do what they like. Forget what I said - if they are the only ones close by to rely on then I would try other techniques to try and get him to sleep through the night. Or is there a  neighbour you get on with who could take your son for a walk in the pram for a couple of hours so you can get your head down? Use your husband a lot more - it doesnt matter if he's been at work all day, you have too looking after the child. he needs to take his turn so you can get some rest.  Good luck with whatever you choose to do (don't choose the m-i-l!!)|`|LCgFShB3aa	Don't worry. This is normal. My baby does the same thing, i get like 2-3 hours per night, yet when she's NOT with me..if someone else is watching her at night I can't sleep and I still get 2-3 hours per night!|`|w7BeIKhZaa	Dont feel bad..every good mom feels this way..you want your break but when it comes along all you can do is think about your kids...i have been away from my daughter 2 times and she is a little over 2 years old ( i think it is time for another break..lol)  because i just cant stand to be away from her...my husband is really good about when he gets home from work watching her to let me sleep for a couple of hours...as long as its someone you trust and you are getting the break you deserve..dont worry.|`|vrwFgpNKaa	oh my god. grow up, he is your responsibility. there is no way i would leave my daughter for a weekend so i can have a break!!!!!!!!!!! get your son in good sleeping routines nd that wil solve your problem. my 4 month old sleep 9pm to 8am every day cos i have been stricked with routines from day one.  and its not silly you miss him i would feel as guilty as hell.. how long will this go on? if its short turn yeah fine.. otherwise i think he is your responsibility. you probably think i am rude but, you are actually making the problem EVEN WORSE sending him to you in laws how will you EVER get a routine happening when there are too many people having there on ideas. your son will just get confused and he will have sleeping problems long term. he needs to be at home in his room in his crib... you are making it worse trust me get a good routine happening then he can stay where ever but until then he needs to be home
SRsFkNBBaa	if i was you, as a mother, i would personally go for either black or white shoes. i let my son get a pair of red shoes, kind of like those, because he begged for them. then, he barely wore them becuase he said they didn't match. "my shirt doesn't have red in it" or whatever.  it is completely up to you thought, and your son. if he likes them, they look like a nice pair of shoes to me. nike is a good brand, and my experience with them, they last a while for kids. which, i am sure you know, go through shoes quick!|`|zjuMrDmGaa	The color is a bit girly.|`|tfdQxfrpaa	They're nice. Clean and new looking. I say Get 'em if they're his style.|`|6iJ30wugaa	I think they are o.k. but if it was me i would let him pick what he likes not what i like.|`|eeGN977eaa	Ask him.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Why wouldn't they be okay?|`|8nZtWHiBaa	yeah i guess... but nike mistreats its workers... bit of trivia for you. everybody has them but i guess they are ok
7Igsjoz7aa	Do as they say, they're being strict because they really love you.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	this is something i keep seeing out of teenagers, they always compare their parents to their friend's parents as if they have something to do with it. your parents are probably strict for a reason, have you done something to lose their trust? if NOT, ask them WHY they are so tough, ask them what can you do to prove to them that they are responsible? maybe get them to meet your friends and their parents so they can feel more comfortable. maybe buy a cell phone so they can keep up with you.|`|HFA05vDuaa	im guessing your parents love you a whole lot and thats why they don't want you going out late. they want to make sure you are safe as long as you are still young|`|Bqtx3CTYaa	Talk to them this is the only way talk about it all ask them why they feel they need to do this and if they don't trust you show them that you can be trusted.  good luck x
AA12243380	He probably just doesn't want to be alone anymore.    I'd let him have the snuggle time in bed with you.  It won't do any harm at all.  :-)    I think it's awesome that at 7 weeks old he will sleep that long.  That's amazingly awesome!      EDIT-My thought is that he went to bed at 7:00 PM and that after he has slept for 7 or 8 hours it's 2 or 3 in the morning and I'd put my baby back down too... or should I say put them down in the co-sleeper.  :-D    I co-slept with my twins when they were infants and they're now toddlers and never ever sleep in our bed- ever.  Even if we TRY they won't sleep in our bed which kind of sucks when they're sick and are up every couple of hours.  I don't believe that co-sleeping with an infant automatically means that your toddler will sleep in your bed.  I think the key is to transition at the right time and for us that was around a year old.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Well he wants to socialize,don't you usually do that after you eat too?  Don't get him in the habit of sleeping with you.  It's not bonding the child will get used to sleeping with you and never want to go to his own room to sleep at 7 weeks its 'cute' at 7 years its just annoying.|`|E9K3QZuyaa	He just wants to be held and be close to you.  He missed not being close to you after having been away for so long.    You did the best thing possible by bringing in bed with you and letting him cuddle.    Our son (9 mo. now) sleeps with us all night, some of our friends think its strange but it works well for our family.  Bedtime is rarely a fight and we all sleep through the night.|`|PbBWJGsTaa	My 9 month old has just started doing this.  She sleeps from 8pm to 5.30am in her cot, waking once usually at around midnight for a cuddle.  At 5.30am, she's wide awake, asks to nurse, plays for a while on mummy and daddy's bed (while mummy comtemplates dragging herself up out of bed for the day), then asks to nurse again.  She then falls asleep lying on my chest, so i go back to sleep too.  Wakes up again at around 8 for breakfast.  I'm seeing a pattern emerge and am wondering how to break it..  I think by being lazy and refusing to get up for the day myself, she's getting bored and a snuggle and snooze with mummy ends up being a nice idea for her.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Sorry... but is anyone else scratching their head wondering why you put him back in his crib after he just got up?    ------------------  Yeah... jealous... keep telling yourself that sweetie... SPECIFICALLY your question just asked..." when he does wake up though he will eat and i will put him back in his crib and he will cry (is fed and changed)."     Yeah. Greeeat sleeper.|`|lGSUToFQaa	first of all let me say this, my sister in law slept with her son from birth but when he turned four she put him in his own bed, and after sleeping with him a couple of nights, he started sleeping in there on his own so sleeping with your baby does not always mean they sleep with you when they are 7,         sorry, now to your question, he associates crib with sleep, my son wakes up and then if you get him out of the crib and put him in his swing, or his bouncer chair, or his carrier, and he goes right back to sleep, he just wakes up, wants changed, he doesn't even eat when he first wakes up, he doesn't eat until 9a even though he wakes up at 5a, and then gets up at 8a, so that is normal, i've even put him in bed with me in the middle of the night when he'd wake up fussy, just pick him up from the crib, change him and put him between my hubby and me, so i think it's normal,    have a great week.|`|tapFZBowaa	He just wants to be close to you....you met all his needs except to be close to Mommy!  Have fun cuddling that baby!|`|awRNr2VMaa	probably just wants some mommy time. at 6 to 7 weeks they start staying awake more so i would let him stay up a while before trying to put him back down to sleep.
lGSUToFQaa	i don't know why even in the real world when i was pregnant, i swear i couldn't go anywhere with out some woman telling me i had to breast feed, or i had to have the baby natural with no meds, or that i can't take medicine being preg, it was crazy, even personal questions like you aren't having sex during the pregnancy are you,     so i think maybe it's because they wish they had done something different with their children so they are trying to force you to do it, but it does get better, my son is 6 months and now people don't really comment too much on my questions, and in the stores people just say "he's gorgeous" and let it go    oh, and i put my son in bed with me to get him to take his 3:30 nap, he won't go to sleep alone and he falls right to sleep with me at 3:30. but he takes his naps alone the rest of the day, so what does it hurt    and it's no ones business what you do with your baby, you are a good mom, and how you raise your baby is your and your hubby's business only, good luck|`|4lHJEq5Haa	because everyone loves to stand on their soapbox.    ***fishes: in some households outside the US, "Tea" means supper...***|`|awRNr2VMaa	i agree with you to a point. you are asking other peoples opinions and they are giving you theirs. i understand the co sleeping i see that if you do it like that it will get to where he wants to be in the bed with you 24/7 my son has slept in the bed with me twice and it was because he was sick. i wasnt going to stay in his room all night and he was better with me. neither time was at night it was when he woke up at like 5 and he usually sleeps til 7 or 8. another thing is the feeding i thought you said 7 months and i thats why i was saying at night he didnt need to eat at 7 weeks they do! btw you said you gave your baby tea. other people are going to be concerned especially if you are saying that he is only 7 weeks!!!! that is sooo bad for him youre ruining his liver. im not criticizing hun im caring about your babys small tiny smaller than his fist liver!|`|sAAnquoTaa	It doesn't. People just like to feel like they're better than others.|`|J5V9dvm8aa	I guess because everyone likes to think that their way of parenting is the best way, and that's why they do it that way.  Some people just need to realise that every parent does what they think is best for their kids and what works for them.  What works for you wouldn't necessarily work for me, but everyone is different.  Don't pay any attention to others' judgements,  just keep doing what you're doing!!|`|fy69hAeQaa	Because there are a lot of people out there who have never learned the meaning of the phrase " Live and Let Live"     You do what you think is best for your child. That is all you can do. If you need advice ask, but it doesn't mean that you have to follow it.    I hear it all the time from other moms about my 3 y/o, he still uses a pacifier. Almost everyone I know has advice on how to get him off and how he should be off of it by now. I figure, when he is ready, he will give it up. He only uses it at home and bedtime now. He isn't going to graduate with the damn thing in his mouth.|`|XUwtAWzkaa	Because the biggest competition between women is who raises their kids better, and if a buttoned up mom sees another mom yell or spank their child they may become offended... to be honest.. I think that people should be allowed to raise their kids how they want and others shouldent intrude on their lives and say what they are doing is wrong.. unless you get to the point where the parents are like intentionally beating their children ect..|`|muRI850haa	I have heard that spoiling your children is only a problem when it becomes a problem. As long as you don't mind spoiling them, what's the problem.    I don't plan on having my first child for another year (finish college first). But I do have a cat, and we give him a saucer of milk every time he asks for it and it doesn't bother us at all, so it isn't a problem.|`|ZRNlwu5laa	Are people really judging or giving simple facts or opinions that are being taken as people being rude or judgemental? When you ask a question to such a large group of people whom are from all different communities, backgrounds, etc. you are going to get a lot of different opinions and people that think your way is right or wrong.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	WHUT!  You go to work!

KHZLPldraa	If your having sex then there is always a chance of getting pregnant.  Geesh. Take a test.|`|6iJ30wugaa	You could be thats one of the signs.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	sounds like it's time to take a test|`|Wc3Vge9taa	You could be. have you taken a pregnancy test yet? you might want to as soon as you can cause if you are pregnant it is important to get prenatal care. best of luck to you!!! :)|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	Yes, it's possible. There is a chance of that happening every time you have sex (unprotected or protected).|`|zRc4Swewaa	Wait until your period comes,if period does not come after 1 week then do a PT.There's a possibility of being pregnant.And observe your discharge,if it is very creamy white and if it's very different from your usual(color)then there's more possibility of being pregnant.Goodluck!!!|`|YqeatZB4aa	It is extremely possible that you are. I would take a test, if you can not afford one then go to the Health Department in your county and they will give you one for free depending on your income. Congrats...|`|32Z7fxWRaa	you might be pregnant or you might not be. these symptoms do sound like pregnancyy ones.  i would take a test just to be safe.|`|eZ1uCUkraa	yes sir|`|mIoFNBRNaa	Yeah u could b...sensitive breasts is a sign n if u feel like throwing up alot u could b. my advice is go to the nearest clinic and get a test and c if u are or not.|`|qSGwW2qIaa	Oh jeez, just take a test. How are we supposed to know if your pregnant or not?
hVVALFAPaa	I would go with a light turquoise, with 60ish kind of accessories.    My daughter could not decide between two colors so she painted two opposite walls turquoise and the other two pink. You could go with a yellowish (like the tiles in the mirror) opposite the turquoise. I think that would be awesome.!|`|KwJDWvB3aa	the url isent working :(|`|Tf0WM1WMaa	i think either a cream, or a light yellow would look Very well. Then you can base your room on the colors on the mirror like blues and yellows. For example, light blue comforters with yellow and such.  btw thats a really cute mirror. Plus my room is brown yellow and light blue |`|UxMugqdraa	The link doesn't work. But i'd like a light color|`|L6acUNBcaa	Link isn't working, but white matches with almost everything as far as i know. You might wanna try a really light purple of some kind.    Good luck!|`|5aTGdBNuaa	Black
hi8A43ibaa	My pediatrician told me to give her lots of tummy time because this is the best exercise for babies to develop their core muscles which are essential for sitting, crawling, walking, etc. I took her in for her 6 month check up and he asked me if she could sit up and I told him no. He took her from me, propped her up on the table and low and behold she could sit up. We practice every day and what seems to help her is if she has something to focus on like a toy in front of her. If she starts to tip to one side I will use the toy to bring her attention back and as she reaches for it, it will balance her out.     I use the Exersaucer, a little tummy time each day and practice with the sitting.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	I just sat her up and she didn't fall over.  She was 5 months.  I started sitting her propped from about 4 1/2 months.|`|Vad64Jjoaa	Just keep working with him the way you are. We also have a Bumbo seat that we use. My daughter is 7 1/2 months old and just now able to sit up on her own for longer periods at a time. When they are ready they will do it. But you are taking the right approach as to helping him along the way.|`|olF9Hl6saa	My little guy was sitting up at 5 months. I used a Boppy to prop him up while placing him on the floor to play.... I think that helped him gain support.|`|e6DDGYmKaa	i put her in her exersaucer for a while, everyday. it helpd her ALOT!! shes now 8 months old.|`|awRNr2VMaa	i never used a boppy or a bumbo. i just stuck him on the floor and he learned himself. he was sitting unassisted at the end of 5 months right before he learned to crawl at the beginning of 6 months he could go from his hands and knees to sitting up.
JvY5KL22aa	i'm TTC  1 too! i have only been trying a couple of months though. it's hard, i feel your pain! seems like when you're trying to keep track of the sex you can't seem to fit it in your schedule!! i bought an ovulation kit. it has helped!! got 2 positives for it, so we tried a lot after that. i haven't tested yet to see if i'm prego or not. and just the other day i was running around telling everyone that my lower abdomen felt so odd! it felt like someone else's warm hand was just slightly holding my lower abdomen! ugh! i've been praying ever since then!! but i try not to think about it so much! i think maybe you should try an ovulation kit. read all the instructions before you open the container if you do decide to get one. good luck to you and lots of baby dust to you!!|`|tjgWwfxLaa	well i hope it is you month.  the one thing my fertility doctor told me is do an ovulation test kit.  when it tells you that you should ovulate which would be 24 to 36 hours later.  sperm only last 3 to 5 days.  you should have sex as much as you can for the next 8 to 10 days every other day.  to make your chances better.  i know what you are going through me and my husband are on opposite schedules also so you just do what you can.  with us it has cost some much money due to i dont release eggs on my own or have menstral cycles but every once and a while i hope this helps good luck|`|HYWNhkXhaa	It could be that you have already conceived but it still to early to tell if your pregnant.  I have been trying to conceive for the past two years and have been unsuccessful.  I have PCOS and have been on fertility treatments for the past year.  I have gotten plenty of advice from friends, when you have sex don't get up right away.  Lay down and prop up your butt with some pillows underneath.  Also, having sex in missionary position is the best position to get you pregnant.  The sperm stays inside you longer that way.  Pillow propping hasn't worked for me, but it did for a couple of friends.  Best of luck to you!|`|GcJszsMnaa	You may have a very good chance hun...Good Luck...Baby Dust ur way!!!|`|tfTQ6Cuuaa	Do it tonight!!!    I know we all tell the foolish 14 year olds that think the pull out method is a form of birth control that you can get pregnant from precum but of course when we WANT it to it probably won't, so make sure he finishes.    If you really did ovulate on the 27th the 24th MAY have done if for you, if he would have finished on the 26th that would've been ideal, but if not you may still catch the egg if you can do it tonight as well. You may be ovulating today, who knows like you said...it's not 100% predictable.    GOOD LUCK!!!|`|srj3LwHvaa	78|`|S9aY6xLKaa	Its possible, even if you're ovulating now sperm can live inside you for up to 7 days.
aymBTRlyaa	Don't put a diaper on her. The best thing is to go cold turkey and switch to undies. It will be hard at first, but will pay off. :-)|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	With my son I  put him back in snap crotch shirts. It worked b/c he couldn't get the snaps opened.. I  put him on pull ups and a snap shirt and take him to potty every hour to hour in and half...hes 3 and doesn't use potty all the time but we don't finger paint anymore either.|`|FvVqFFrNaa	omg, i have a 7 week old and now i know what i have to look forward to. i will take the colic again over this. oh no. im stressin now|`|eHow24rNaa	I know it can be hard to potty train a toddler...but my best advise would be to call her doctor and talk to him/her about it. Theres certain things he can tell you to try out. Until you get her to the doctor to talk about your options, you need to make sure she knows she did wrong and put her in time out for 2 minutes every time she tries to pull the diaper off...hopefully the poop problem will be fixed for your sake...lol!!!|`|Tv8MjT7kaa	go to the panties.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	I say buy some training pants (not the diaper kind) and just use diapers at night. Also, watch her, when she starts to grunt or "hides" to do her business, take her to the potty. Get books about "big girls" using the potty. That helped my daughter a lot, she wanted to be like the little girls in the book. Be consistent with her, and lots of praise...maybe a reward like a sticker when she does go in the potty.|`|h9M7w9Y2aa	you know my son is 21 months and he does the same thing.  one time we were napping he woke up, i was still sleeping he took his diaper off and was playing in it, i woke up to this awful smell right in my face.. he was showing it to me.... i know so gross... same thing with him, he will only use the potty when he wants to.  so i just kept tight onzies on him so he couldn't get it off... i kinda helped. other than that i don't have much advice just wanted to let you know you are not the only one!!! joys of motherhood, lol!! good luck!
VUNfI7yBaa	OH... NO, you are completely right, Do NOT have that abortion. Your dad can not MAKE you do it. Getting that abortion will hurt you more than if you keep it, you tell your dad. It will give you many emotional scars, even if it were rape, you are doing the right thing in keeping the baby. Having an abortion can also cause you physical problems too, i.e.... Pelvic infections,      internal bleeding, in some cases it is severe due to a perforated uterus. can cause sterility and other serious and permanent problems.      Scientific studies demonstrates that the chance of miscarriages significantly increases with abortion as much as 10 fold.        tubal infertility has been found to be up to 30% more comon among women who have had abortions   Abortion significantly raises the rate of breast cancer.

Trust me, they won't allow your dad in there during the procedure. Once you get away from your dad explain to the doctors and nurses the situation and tell them you fear for your unborn baby's safety! They will do everything in their power to help you, even if it means calling the cops and having you removed from the home for a short time while your family goes through counseling. DO NOT go threw with this if you do not want to. Your father is not god, he cannot decide who lives and who dies. This whole thing is being fueled by his fear of embarrassment of HIM! how he will look....    Best of luck hun!|`|ezI5HwRWaa	He cannot make you. I suggest that you keep your distance from him though. I'm proud of you for wanting to keep the baby =) It is definitley not a sin like your father thinks. Every life has a purpose and there's a reaon for the baby you have. Tell an adult who you trust. Tell them what your father is telling you, and that you want to keep the baby. Stay at a friend's house, away from your father. If you do end up going, tell the hospital or wherever, that you DO NOT want to abort that baby. Tell them that you dad is telling you to. You dad cannot do anything about it. If he tries to hurt you or force you to have an abortion, you need to stay away from him.    No baby's life is a mistake.|`|c11d9e210c7f4c6d205b2ecac5d541a2aa	no dont stand for it either.|`|cUYunFvHaa	umm, well that sucks, i think u should do it, unless u werent really raped, and u regret lying and want to save sumthing by having the child, butt..........im an @asshole anyway, so hate my for that, i think u should get rid of the egg before it develops, because yes its part u but also part beast, and it could carry more if those traits, besides, ur not ready for a kid, and ur parents will inevitably have to take the burdon of financial responsability, have u looked into welfare? also i cant understand ur phsycology of wanting it, but thats personal, i do however feel ur pain, im guess an aborion that is forced is like being raped all over again, but that aside i would still judt do it and get out of the house as soon as u turn 18, no now ur 15 and can legally work , and because u dont have school u can work full time, so then if u save u can probably have more than enough money to get an appartment in a town with a jr college , or hell even apply to the big schools with ur sat scores and ur college letter telling ur story there is a good chance if ur smart they will throw a schalorship ur way, but in my personal opinion u should do it, beyond that i also think u have no choice in the state and its crappy laws, but may u have strength young girl, have strength|`|QJbFD1T0aa	Your dad cant make you have an abortion... but you might want to consider how your child might feel.. many children brought up alone with a raped mother get depressed and commit suicide... and you dont want your child to do that!

And if ur dad wants to talk sins..Tell him that abortion is murder and murder is a sin. You can also get emancipated. but in some states having a baby automaticaly emancipates you. You are that baby's mother, and no one but you can decide. Besides if you are so far along they wont do the abortion anways, you can only be a certain amount of weeks, so if you can hold off till whatever the cut off line is then no one can abort it,  not even you.|`|TBZ0ScFfaa	dont go and try to skip the appointment and hide out at a friends house or something  or get your mom involved|`|AA12164862	He cannot MAKE you have an abortion.  It is YOUR child.  You have to make up your mind as what to do about the baby..at 15 perhaps you might consider adoption. But if you DO decide to keep the child it will be really hard for you to do so at 15.|`|InZU5aaxaa	Legally he can not make the decision. If something were to happen you have complete say over the baby and your baby's body. So he can not say you can have an abortion. However if something were to happen to you, you are still a minor and he has say over you and your body.    After you have the baby and the baby gets sick you get to make the choice of what happens to that baby. However if you get sick even though you are now a Mom and can legally make those decisions your dad can say what kind of treatment you get.    Hope this helps. Also what does your mom say? Try to ask another female family member to help in this situation. I wish I could help more.|`|dbyLDPwmaa	Im sorry to hear dat but I say u dont abort....i gotta say he has the rite to decide because ur only 15 but he should also see that its not the baby's fault....u should sit down with him and talk let him know wat u feel tell him wat u said in ur question...|`|joPJtKemaa	If this question is for real, then I agree with your dad, I might get thumbs down for this but if this baby is not out of love why would you want to keep it??????     Wouldn't this baby remind you of the jerk who raped you? Common you are only 15 not 40. You will have plenty of children with a man you love.    I am PRO-Life but in your situation I am PRO-CHOICE.    Stay in school get an education and give your children the best.|`|2bOP8Fdnaa	Its your body and he cant make you have an abortion.

Remind your dad to keep his head since this is a grand baby.    Your dad is looking long term ....as the rest of your life will be nurturing this baby and it will be a drain on someones finances, and by all means if the rape was from a friend and not a stranger tell people and get the dad out of jail.

There is no government in the U.S that would allow a legal enforcement of any such thing. In some states, you would need his PERMISSION to have an abortion, but in absolutely no state whatsoever can an abortion be performed without YOURS. Tell the doctor performing the procedure that this isn't your choice. He will respect that, he will not try to talk you out of it and he will refuse to perform the abortion. If you need additional help, then call social services and they'll be out to help you right away. Call 1-800-4-A-CHILD, the National Child Abuse Hotline. (That's 1-800-422-4453)    It's not any of my business, but are you really sure you want to raise a child at your age? If you choose open adoption, you can still be a part of your baby's life, forever! You will also be able to choose your baby's adoptive parents yourself, from a list of couples an agency will provide for you. They'll go through as many couples as it takes to find you the right ones for your baby--the ones YOU decide are the right ones, not them.     Whatever you decide, though, honey, you have my best wishes.|`|L0873cdDaa	He can not make you have an abortion. It is your body and your baby, you are in charge.|`|77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	Regardless of these morality enforcers say (and who dare they, anyway, to try to use THEIR beliefs to convince you), I believe your dad has every right to make that decision-- you are under the age of 16, which is the age of consent, and your parents are the ones who legally control healthcare decisions for their children.  You have to realize that if you carry that baby to term and you keep it, not only will your life be turned upside down, every time you look at the child that rape will stare you in the face. If you give it up for adoption, or it enters the foster care system, you'll have no say who it goes to.  I hope the DA goes after whomever it was that raped you and throws him in jail for a VERY long time. Men in the jail general population will seriously damage, or even kill, a child-rapist.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	you asked this last night...and you got alot of answers, good ones.       no your dad cannot force you to get an abortion. you are medically emancipated during your pregnancy.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Ok- you need to decide, if abortion is out of the question, to keep the baby or adopt. Tell your father that you feel uncomfortable with an abortion because THAT is more of a sin than keeping it, and if he is still insistent on it, then when he takes you to get it done make sure that you tell the doctor who is going to be performing the abortion that you do not want one and your dad is making you. I think that at 15 they can't force to to get an abortion if you don't want one, and the doctor won't do it. You need to fight this with everything you've got. It's not going to be easy. Talk with your dad first, but when you talk to him make sure you have a plan in mind so that you can tell him exactly what you want. In the end it is going to be your decision.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Hmm... I smell BS.  For you to be not far enough along that an abortion is still a viable option, AND to have him in jail seems highly unlikely.    If this is true, nobody can force you to have an abortion.  No doctor would perform one against a patient's wishes.  They would end up in jail.    (edit)  "For those who asked about where my mother is she is watching over me in a special spot in heavan. After having my sister . . . . she pasted away."    Yup, it's getting pretty deep around here.  Hmmm... Can't bond with a kid, raped while coming home from the library, young and innocent, dead mother, evil dad.  Sounds like the plot to a fairytale if I've ever heard one.  Right down to the "Golly gee, I got my GED, and I'm trying to be good..."  Try clicking your heels together Dorothy.   And repeat after me... "There's  no place for trolls.  There's no place for trolls."
NrwJyffxaa	Lots of children are visual take and write the 10, 20 ..... 50 ... 100 show him that they are just 1-10 with a 0 on the end.  then point out that after 1-9 you go to 10 back to 1 with a 0.   Then point out that all he is doing is counting to 10 over and over again. and then as the number hits 10 you just count to 10 in the next column.    Hope this helps my son struggled learning the names but could write them easily.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	You might help him think in decades by writing the numbers 0, 10, 20, 30 on some containers (like Chinese plastic quart soup take out containers or similar) and also writing the digits 1 through 9 on something small and easy for him to handle, like, say, white poker chips.    He can sort the digits into piles (this is where stackable poker chips come in handy) of similar digits, put them in order, then count by pitching them, one at a time into the containers, starting with the zero container.    Each time he gets to a 9 and he has run out of piles, you sit that container into the next higher one and go through the digits again.  Doing this out loud helps reinforce how 10 20, etc, are decade containers built of smaller such  containers, and that you add digits to.    This will help them with later math concepts that deals with columns (decades, hundreds, thousands), like addition and multiplication, too.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|SR5zlAl8aa	give him this  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10   11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40   41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50   51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60   61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70   71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80   81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90   91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100|`|TqkJQZvzaa	Count together. At night 40 minutes before he goes to bed say lets try to count to 100. You can take turns like he counts to ten you count to twenty he counts to thirty you count to fourty. He will get the hang of it ^^|`|DKqsFGymaa	Try to teach him that when he gets to the last number in the string, he has to then look at the first digit to see what comes next.  So when he gets to 29, what comes after the two;  three, so next is thirty.      If that doesn't work, I might try working with him over and over again counting by tens so he has the order memorized.  10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60...    Good luck.  You're a good parent being willing to work with him!|`|eTuK9t85aa	My daughter does the same thing  What i do it when she says 29, i ask her what comes after 2 and then she gets it, and she says 39, and i ask her what comes after 3.

LDymSz96aa	can highly recommend the Boundaries books. The facility for troubled kids that I worked in used this method and it was pretty effective even with kids with serious mental health issues. Basically, you need to take away everything you have bought for him, except that which you are required to provide for him: a mattress, clean bedding and enough clothes to get by (your choice, not his). This means everything: computers, video games, Ipods, cool clothes, cell phones, everything! Put it somewhere he can't get to it, like a rented storage locker. Give him hard and fast rules with no ambiguity: No tobacco products, bedtime is ?, no trouble at school, all homework done and signed by dad before bed, all checked homework given to dad in good condition when its returned (pick one parent so he can't play you against each other). For every week that he is in compliance, he can get back one item of your choosing (don't give back his favorites first).|`|RklASxmMaa	If you don't discipline and bring order to your son ( and all your children) they will go down the wrong path in life. e.g. drugs, skipping school, ( all the general bad stuff) Your better of now being strict with him, and making him work and make sure he knows your the boss because if you don't do it now, it would be a lot harder later.     They say that grabbing children to work young is the best you could ever do for your child. Why? well, when they are young, they are not scared e.g. of a book report or maths ( probably one of the reasons why he didn't even do it) and if he becomes acustomed into writing reports, doing math sums, when hes older it would be a peice of cake, it would all fall in to place because he would have that solid foundation to build his knowledge upon, and thats the difference for learning with adults and children. Its alot hard to learn something new when your adult because that adult understands what it is and how difficult it may be.    Take my brother, my mum was very strict to him when he was about 10 years old, and now in his GCSEs ( british examinations) he managed to get 5 A* and 6 As. when i heard of it, i was amazed.    As a punishment i would make him do 4 book reports, and make him read to you alloud, ( alloud to improve the childs pronounciation of words)    But don't stop him reading once all the book reports are done, keep getting him to read, eventually if you do this to all your children then they will grow up acustomed to it, and grow up to love it.    Hoped i helped ;D|`|U8gIdoXFaa	I think you are alread doing the best thing. Obviously you and hubby are trying to stay on top of it which is difficult if you dont know whats going on. The appointment you have with the teacher is the first step in showing your son you are onto him and that his parents and his teacher have joined forces, so to speak, which will in turn put more pressure on him to do his work.     Setting reminders and knowing when assignments are due is a brilliant idea. It gives you the upper hand and an opportunity to keep a check on him, whereas before you were oblvivous. Your son will know he cant pull the wool over your eyes anymore.     With all that said, be sure he doesnt have any learning difficulties. This can make kids appear to be lazy or disinterested in school. Its possible he didnt do the work because he found it too hard. It thats the case, punishing him wont help. Helping him with his work will help.     If you know for fact that he is just being lazy, then yea, everything you are doing is spot on,.|`|7Ol7uHYSaa	that he cant go to a upcoming thing at school  or have his friends over and for you to hang with them and tell him that he has to go to his room, and never give in|`|27722e46d7e1a47f6c3e2edef016aa14aa	Whenever my son doesn't do homework we do the following-    Grounding for 1-4 weeks  *No Friends Over  *No Computer  *No T.V.  *No Phone    Also,  For minor offences we do half an hour early bedtime.     They are both very affective.

Everything at once will make it too difficult for you to supervise and will cause problems  for you.  I understand you are concerned because it is school work. But sometimes you need to let the teachers give out the consequences at school for what goes on at school. That leaves you to be more positive with him.  all the same you can set aside time to let him know he needs to be working on his reports and warn him of the consequences of not getting his work done.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Sounds like you need to be harsher in your grounding, what else can you take away (believe me there's always something). You'll probably also need to keep in contact with his teacher so that you can stay on top of his assignments.     As some one else mentioned military school, I say that's probably a good idea if he doesn't straighten out soon, this is the time when you need to nix all those bad habits. Plus, it'll show your other kids what happens when they don't do well in school.|`|yV8fog7Paa	what we do with my brother (who is 3 mo. younger than I am, he's 16.) my dad keeps in contact with my brothers teachers because he is the same way. Get the teachers emails and email them weekly to see if there is ANY missing assignments or anything, and ask him how he behaves in school and things like that. Get a planner and have him write down the assignment for every subject every day and at the end of the day or class have each teacher assign it and if he does not do that ground him. We do that with my brother because he never does his work if he doesn't have that.     If 3 weeks wasn't long enough, make it a month. If that's not long enough nest time make it TWO months. ^^|`|StuXqez7aa	Call his teacher and see when he'll have another book report.  Then, help him work on it.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Threaten him with military school.  My mom always used to do that to my brother and it worked like a charm.|`|69bp1IMfaa	7 days without sweet solid foods, THIS IS VERY EFFECTIVE.

I have been stressing out so much that I think that is why It hasn't been happening ;) My last MP was January 3rd! So I too still have to wait a few more days... Geez we seem to wishing our lives away don't we??!!     Ok I can say I have been there done that 6 times now, so how about you wait at least 2 days after your period is due!! Just so you get a more accurate result!! I know it's hard, i should know ;)    I have a feeling this isn't my month... my hubby and I should of had sex more than what we did!     SO next month will be my month I just know it!! I hope you are right about this month being yours! good luck to you and Baby dust!!!!!!|`|wWkfASTNaa	The absolute soonest you could test would be 10 DPO if implantation took place at or just before 7 DPO.

I am on the same cycle as you LOL and waiting till Friday :) GL and baby dust.
wOyyZjY0aa	I have heard right before.  It's your body preparing for ovulation.  I'm not 100% but that is what ladies on YA have told me.  I have it for approx. 3 days (TMI....sorry) So it must be right before ovulate.  Best of luck!!!|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	The EWCM can start a couple days before ovulation as this is already prime time for the sperm to get a head start on their way to the ripening egg. Almost immediately after ovulation, the road starts to dry up as it is a lost cause for sperm who are more than 12 hours past the egg's release.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	It should be at the pick of your ovulation.|`|JjBwydymaa	when your ovulating....but it can be easily missed!

q7sgWqZ3aa	The only 100% way to tell if your having a girl is too wait until that big day comes and out comes baby! An ultrasound can usually tell if its a boy/girl but sometimes they can be wrong! It mainly depends on hows well the baby cooperates. Sometimes the legs are crossed or the baby is laying in a weird position so they can't get a clear shot. Although the technololgy today is more accurate then like 10 years ago or should be anyway =D.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Ultrasound! This is the only way you can know and it isn't for 100% either. Sometimes surprises happen :)|`|vKEYa8aeaa	you will either see 3 lines on the ultrasound or a lil "hamburger" when she is born|`|UYfqzCoMaa	An ultrasound that shows the little girlie parts.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Either a sonogram or look between the baby's legs when it's born.  The whole heart beat/ how you carry thing is a myth.|`|3gXQPso5aa	by ultrasound, there are tales that say if you carry high crave sweets etc. but i don't think they are accurate|`|4TNavgDuaa	3d sonogram are fun! You can find out sooner most of the time.|`|gG8oyymiaa	By an ultra sound or wait till the baby is born.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	They do an ultrasound.|`|qH6ecSa3aa	Ultrasound or Amniocentesis. But please do not have an Amnio unless there is something wrong with the baby, or you are over 35.|`|tsWZYf49aa	A few ways you can tell. If you get heartburn a lot, you start getting hair on your chest, your lips start to get big, or if you bruise easily. These are all signs that you will have a girl.

kdxxuQwNaa	Meet outside school and your houses. Her mom might be suffering from some syndrome or another for being clingy. It might make her mad if you tell her that though.|`|sVa5xELDaa	No its not stupid becuase there IS such thing as  secondhand smoking,so yout friend could get cancer and her mom probably  and most likely doesnt want that to happen  i wouldnt.|`|0cgAzc3Uaa	I don't think that's right at all! First of all her mother is being hypocritical, second of all, she shouldn't stope her daughter from hanging out with you just because your parents have a bad habit, and third of all, smoking does not make your parents bad people, and it is ridiculous that she won't let your friend see you anymore over something that trivial. Unless your parents are smoking three packs in front of her or whatever, your friends mom is making a huge deal out of a small thing.|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	They just don't like her to be around smoke. BUT she needs to get real this world has millions of smokers she cant keep her  from all of them. Its not like they stay in your bedroom an smoke. Maybe your parents an her mom can set up some rules when she is over. But i do think her mom is a bit uptight about this one.|`|UxMugqdraa	my parents are a whole lot stricter than that. Why won't you just hang out at her house?|`|6gthdHpnaa	It's not right for you to be disrespectful toward her mom, her mom has those rules for a reason. Your friend is still a child and needs some aspects of her life to be taken care of by her parents, so "letting her get a life" is probably not the best option right now. Since the mother drank and did drugs, she probably feels bad and wants to be a really good influence for her daughter, so that might be why she is overdoing it. You can't get secondhand smoke everywhere, and not everyone is smoking. Smoking is not something healthy, and parents are right to try to keep their kids away from its unhealthy benefits. Just because a lot of people smoke doesn't mean kids should be subjected to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, and just because there is a lot of secondhand smoke doesn't mean it's not very, very harmful. If you really cared about this friendship, you'd be her friend and hang out with her at her house or whatever suited her parents, no matter what her mom is like. Her parenting style may be different from the way you were raised, but you should still respect that.|`|cIROBuszaa	She has a problem with smoking. Her mom probably doesn't want her to become like her, or your parents. She doesn't want her to smoke. Second hand smoke isn't good for your lungs anyway. Maybe she should invite you to her house more often.
bitKsIPkaa	honestly, I think that is a little invasive of your mother, especially beings that you are a senior in High School. I could understand her being mad, but I think she could have been a little more mature about the situation and actually talk to you about it rather than getting pissy and throwing stuff.|`|TWlrETr3aa	thats crazy, i'm 14 and my mom heard my conversation about sex she just gave me the talk and said if you every need anything just ask,      tell her the truth, hopefully she'll understand, tell her your not doing anything, and if you were to you'd be safe,|`|MigBOiUPaa	wow thth sucks. I would just try and play it all like be like " i knew u were home and i knew tht u were listening at my door so  thts why we were sayin all tht stuff cuz i knew u were bein nosey"    or just tell them that yall werenn;t being serious and by putting u on birth control it gives u a free pass to go do wut she thinks ur doing. just stay calm when ur talking to them so they'll probably end up believing u in the end,      good luck!!!!|`|A5sjOsrDaa	wow, this same thing happened to me yesterday. my uncle went thru my text messages and showd them to my dad about a party i wanted to go to. i got all mad, threw a fit and now im grounded. my dad took my phone away too. but my dad is nowhere as mean as yours. he would never throw my phone or break my stuff. thats a crazy stuff rite there. anywhere, heres what i would do. the truth is your mom is gonna tell your dad. no matter what you say to her because when moms threaten to tell dad, they always do. maybe you should just try apologizing to her for getting mad and stuff. maybe that will soften her up. and when she does tell your dad, say your sorry and you didnt really mean it. then hope for the best. i really dont know what to tell ya cuz my parents arent that mean. sorry. good luck|`|46uiaxPUaa	I think that's a little harsh of her because you are 17 but if she is paying for the phone then i think she has all the right to go through it and take it away. Try talking to her and let her know that you're only playing around and cry lol~!|`|69bp1IMfaa	They should have, I thank God they listened to your conversation. Tell them to keep up the good work!|`|WEYA89znaa	Ha ha... This happened to me but it was a text message... I left my phone in my car when I went to run in my house and get something. My lovely parents decide to look at my texts and one of them was from a guy friend and he said something stupid like your acting like a ho** just as like a joke. My parents went all off on me and like you I got my phone taken away... I just told them strait out that it was a joke he was just kidding and they understood and I got my phone back (after like a week). Since I am 14 and they listened I think you being 17 they would be more understanding.|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	Well you did something that was not "right" in her mind. Its her house her rules. You should not of been on speaker phone while talking like that. She should have dealt with it in another way. She was prob mad. Tell her your sorry but your 17 and your growing up. Maybe she is right about the birth control. If your not haven sex tell her that but if you are then be honest with her. Tell her that you don't want your dad knowing about this because it would make matters worse.   I am sure she still thinks of you as that 10 yr old lil girl who is not rdy for talking like this or haven sex.     When i was younger my grand maw taped phone calls an i never knew this an my family heard some pretty bad things with my phone calls. I just found the tapes an i heard them i was shocked now i know why my family never trusted me lol.|`|mb9pL423aa	Time to take responsibility. You got caught acting like a 13 year old about serious stuff. If you think having kids with him while you're still in high school is funny and you throw a fit over loosing your phone, let your parents be pissed and let them get you the birth control. You really don't need to procreate anyway.
SEzIkGNiaa	No, thats not true.  Statistics show that babies that are breastfed, have a higher IQ.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Not thats not true.  they iq think actually traces back to genetics - mothers of higher intelligence seem to be more likely to breastfeed, that how i interpreted this newest study.  breastfeeding is normal and natural, nothing wrong with it or the parent or the child (unless the mother is doing it to her 8 year old....)|`|fAWyK2sTaa	Yes, the American Association of Pediatrics supports breastfeeding.  Their studies indicate that breastfed children tend to have higher IQs & higher immunity systems.  The cholestrum, an initial yellowish secretion from mother's breast is full with antibiodies.  They say "breast is best" & is the best nutrition a mother can give her babies BUT the formula companies have also developed formula to be as similar as possible to mother's milk.  My personal opinion, is that breast is best, even if you do it just for a few days.  I hope this answers your questions.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	breastfeeding has been done since the beginning of time. the formulas that are used nowadays are actually copied off of breastmilk.  breastfeeding is a personal choice now, long ago, it was the only choice.   it doesnt make a difference weather you were breastfed or bottle fed. they do alot of studies and the only thing they know for certain, is breastmilk has more immunity /sickness fighting antibodies in it. the colostrom, which first comes out of the breast, before the milk is produced (after the baby is born) is what cannot be copied, and is said to be the best for the baby. when animals are born, some won't survive if they aren't able to get the "colostrom" from their mother. learn something new everyday, huh?? lol-  my answer isn't saying one way is better than the other, to each their own. im answering your question by saying that it is ridiculous to say one person is different than the other based on how they were fed as babies-tell that to your people at school.|`|J4AyTTZ3aa	There is a lot of information on breastfeeding in this article  http://www.parentingaustralia.com.au/con...    I believe it helps pass on the mothers anti bodies to her child and boosts their immune system
3XaREbrQaa	i love your choice: Holland Monroe Finley. i think monroe flows nicely with it. but if your husband wants a less "quirky" name, do holland as the first name and grace as the middle name. i think that sounds good too, even though grace is a very common name, but not as common as marie. good luck choosing!!!|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	Why don't you compromise with Holland Grace or Holland Marie?    I like the name Holland alot and I was always thinking of using it as Holland Violet but it sounds a little weird now.          hope i helped!|`|tsWZYf49aa	how about shaunte darnese|`|eAlb085caa	I'm not big on the name Holland..but if you absolutely want that name, no questions asked then maybe you could use "Holland Grace"?|`|hR1LlS2Haa	Grace Holland or Holland Marie. Compromise|`|YcLImmyraa	What about Holly Marie, Holly Grace, Grace Monroe or Grace Holland?    Personally, I don't like Holland as a name, just reminds me of the Netherlands.|`|OhaosQ14aa	oh no not grace!!! i hate how everyone is naming their kid that  its a nice name and all but no! lol  i like Holland Monroe.. i do have to say its a little out there  but it sounds nice you could also use holly if you want  but definetly stick with your choice|`|e0f6ef0b78482e0ade9fff1ff8d8b26caa	How about Gracie Rose?|`|785684c905911781314e17a1cecdeb2eaa	I love Holland Monroe Finley!!  So unique and adorable.|`|eZKP9MhJaa	Grace Monroe|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	How about Grace Monroe or Grace Holland? Grace matches with big sister's first name as being really timeless and Monroe or Holland would follow the pattern of having a less common middle name.|`|4TNavgDuaa	Harper Marie Finley|`|fEcNMm05aa	I think Holland is a beautiful name.    Middle Names: Lorraine, Louise, Marie, Brynn, Claire, Blair, Renee'    Alternate First Names: Lydia, Madeline, Madalynn, Blythe, Kimber, Jamie, Loretta, Charlotte, Jossie, Tessa.    :D   Congrats, and Good Luck.|`|5sYzlAjPaa	i agree with you that Grace and Marie are way too overused. However Rose and Grace go nice together and seem to  be from the same "family". I love Genevieve. Holland is sooooo cute. New and refreshing.     I like Holland Monroe.     Holland Marie would also work nicely.|`|CI4oAV0oaa	If you want to keep Holland, I say compromise and pick Holland Marie.    My favorite for a first name is Grace though. How about Grace Ella Holland?  Grace Emmeline?
siDcjgJCaa	My daughter is not a newborn anymore.. she is 7 months. We play with her toys, or my Tupperware... we crawl around the house, go for walks, play peek-a-boo, read books... its quite exhausting actually..|`|PkWX9Ouwaa	I try and talk to him as much as I can because I think that quality time with with parents is the best thing for a baby.  If I run out of things to say I read a book.  Dr. Seuss is great.  Of course we make faces and touch his nose and face to make him smile or use rattles and other toys.  The craziest thing is sometimes he just wants to watch TV.  If you get in his way then he will just crane his neck to look around you.  He is only 11 weeks old.|`|476Ysdfaaa	talk to the baby :) soon you'll be able to do much more than just talk and sing|`|AA10487943	Baby Einstein toys ROCK! And Fisher Prices has a really cool ocean play mat for babies with a ball and bright toys that hang from it
Z9uXyb17aa	it looks as if there are two sacs. def. a baby in the one, and i can almost see a fant sac in the other, you are early and some people can't even see a sac this soon, my guess would be yes, there is a very good chance your having twins, congrats!|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	possible. how far along are you?    im 31 weeks with twins...fraternal twins and they have two seperate sacs. i was able to see this clearly at 7weeks. it may be too early to tell for you having twins, im not sure.    i'm guessing that they didn't say anything because they just don't know yet. they do that with the genders too...they wont tell you something if they aren't totally sure. you'll have another ultrasound and they'll be able to see it clearly. it kind of looks like another sac, but it doesn't look like what i see when i see my ultrasounds with twins.|`|vdIZU4ePaa	It sure does to me!|`|GZrR0uxjaa	yeah it could be, what did the doc say? how far along are you? congrats!|`|mCDopsLEaa	honestly it looks like an invisible twin. To me the sack looks very clear, however I don't see an embryo. Did the doctor say anything about this "extra yolk"|`|SGeo7cqYaa	It definitely could be twins! But I'm not sure, so check with your doctor.|`|5099ffc117e8dfe6b95f19667ddf615baa	No the baby is the white part not the dark circle,it would be triplets if you count the circles cuz there is a third one there lol.The dark circles are just air bubbles that the ultrasound hits.|`|tfTQ6Cuuaa	Hard to tell since I have never seen an ultrasound pic of twins that early on, only later. It could be just a shadow.    Good luck either way, how exciting! Are you on fertility drugs?|`|b4d9549d46983fced7e264d76911b93aaa	could possibly be twins... how exciting...     Congrats!|`|NtcezzKEaa	idk it could be.. if ur wanting twins then i hope it is! lol good luck with your baby(ies)|`|6a0cd0391065cc81ea4518dae3754040aa	Actually, that could be both the head and the torso of one baby. (Remember, most ultrasound pics are taken from the side!) One way to tell this early is if your alpha fetoprotein test comes back wonky. (Two babies would cause an abnormal result, since they're looking for levels associated with ONE baby.)    If you've already had the alpha fetoprotein test and it came back normal, twins are unlikely. If you haven't, then it's still quite possible.     Either way, best wishes!|`|AA12045892	Although it does kind of look like two sacs, I don't think that they would look like that at 6 weeks. The tech would have said something and you would be seeing your doctor much sooner. You are very closely monitored when pregnant with twins.
PYSMK0JBaa	maybe a tooth? Possibly she is starting to have bad dreams..I think this is the age that can start happening. Hope it doesn't last too long:) I remember all my children going through stages like this, it will pass just stick to your routine and ride it out. It will get easier! Heck I can't get my 13 yo to WAKE up half the time anymore and he was a night owl for the first 5 years of his life! Good luck and hope you all get some rest soon.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Did you offer to let her sleep with you?    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	If you have her in day care check to make sure the person watching her isn't making her sleep too much during the day so she's not sleepy at night.  Also check to see if she's eating something with sugar or a\other stimulants that can be causing this.  Good luck
5DJcir9saa	Well if your parent is a good leader, he/she should be able to help you =)|`|AA11895525	Because once you become a parent you look at the world in a whole new way.  You want to make it a better place because your child and their friends will be living in it.  Its a hard thing to explain - have you asked your parent?
780ByZVEaa	it happens within a year|`|DNygQdmVaa	anytime in the 1st year.  my sons changed from blue to green at about 10 months.|`|iqpa6W7qaa	i heard with in the first year.....|`|PBI3tCKaaa	I heard they can be fixed by six months.|`|3ye0Pureaa	I don't agree with most of these comments. I was born with blue eyes, The changed to green around the age of 5 and then to a dark Hazel between the ages of 12-16. Same with my little brother who now has D. brown eyes and same for my dad. I think it just depends on your genetics.|`|wlAmUQe3aa	It's generally accepted that baby's eye colour is fixed by around 6 months.
aQ8o4w3Xaa	It's not really because you're breaking the hymen. That can easily be done before you first have sex and you won't notice much. The reason it hurts is because you're being stretched out.     It's like blowing up a balloon. When you first try to blow it doesn't quite work and it can take a few times before it easily stretches to the right shape. Then, after a few puffs, it easily blows out into shape and becomes normal. Think of it like that. It will take a few times until your vagina has stretched and opened enough so that it isn't put under pressure.     When you first have sex, be relaxed and don't think too much. That will only make you tenser, which will make it hurt more. Invest in some lube, such as KY jelly. That will really ease the process and make it better for both people. Make sure adequate foreplay has taken place first. It will prepare you and make it easier. If you jump straight in, it will hurt you far more.    Good luck!  :)|`|6gthdHpnaa	Because the vagina has never accomodated a penis before, and it might be rather large and the vagina needs to stretch, also because some girls have a hymen, a flap of skin covering the vagina. It can be broken by activities besides sex, and not all girls have a hymen, but often it is broken by the first sexual intercourse, and that can be painful and involve bleeding.|`|oQDQSSSDaa	Because it breaks your hymen.|`|N53iI8weaa	Because you're losing your virginity|`|cIROBuszaa	Because you're breaking your hymen.|`|nfpDIPykaa	you arent used to it and your not streched out.|`|MJF7nMbpaa	it depends on different people. It is NOT usually because ur hymen is breaking because the usually breaks doing normal thinks like running and biking. Its because ur vigina hole is so fukn small and his dick is usually quite big! you vagina has to streach to fit it which HURTS.    Please use protection|`|oiDD5fpDaa	Because your ripping the skin around your vagina hole !  DUH !!!!!!!!  Its like when  you use a tampon it hurts the first time you put it in it hurts.  Same with sex|`|kDvKc3npaa	Because you are ripping and stretching the little bit of skin that covers your vaginal opening called the Hymen.  Some girls don't have them and others do, it may hurt for the first few times you have sex because your body is still getting used to stretching for it|`|A3zAXntxaa	Two possible reasons.    1.) You have your hymen still intact, which is a thin piece of skin covering your vag.    2.) You're not used to your vag being stretched out like that. So yeah.      Or it could be the combination of both.    Good luck with that, haa.
PG7WfGpHaa	I think that could be termed 'cruel or unusual punishment'.  They could probably appeal against it.|`|eHow24rNaa	This is such a sad situation...if your talking about yourself, then you should talk to the people who handle cases like this. I guess a DA or Lawyer would lead you in the right direction. If he threatened to hurt the mother and unborn child and is a drug offender....you need to let someone know NOW...for the safety of yourself and child. You can get some papers written up that you want supervised visitations if he wants to see the child and you can even get a restraining order against him for yall safety. He wont get full custody of the child but its up to you if you want to take the actions of him not seeing his kid or seeing the kid under supervision. Take care of yourself and if i were you, i would go ahead and talk to a lawyer and get it written down on paper the things he's done and said to you|`|cjmP2ACDaa	I honestly think he would have no chance of getting that child!!! Unless the mother (which you really don't seem to be) didn't want the baby or put the baby in harms way. But even then I think the baby would be put up for adoption! As for child support for him paying would probably be almost nothing as well, since they go by his taxed income..... which it doesn't seem like he has any.
YgDKvY7Raa	Ok well may 2008 I had a stillbirth at 22 weeks and had blood tests done to make sure my hormone went back to 0 and it did. I wasn't really having a period so I haf my dr to a blood test in the end of june and it was negative, about 1 1/2-2 weeks later I took a HPT and I got a really faint positive I called my dr and told them I got a positive HPT and I went in to the office and tested there it came up negative and then I showed them my positive test so they sent me for a blood test, the blood test came back that I was pregnant and my HCG was 26. So I went back a few days later got checked out and got another blood test and my levels were going up just like they should have been. Sadly though I did miscarry at 7 weeks. Hope thid helps even though your levels are low doesn't mean your not pregnant it could be you found out really early, just like me. Good luck and congrats!|`|mCDopsLEaa	implantation bleeding should not be occurring at 3 weeks. as the egg only survives 24 hours after ovulation and sperm can only survive 7-10 days. I am sorry but since your hcg levels are really low, you could be having a miscarriage. I'm sorry sweetie.|`|C76qRcafaa	You should go back to your doctors immediately!!  I thought that if you have spotting or any symptoms of a period, then this means that you are not pregnant.. but i could be wrong..  if the doctors test said that you were, then that usually means that you are...    go back to see him1!!!|`|6a0cd0391065cc81ea4518dae3754040aa	It's possible that you're just very early and having longer-than-usual implantation bleeding, but from what you say (continuous spotting, dropping hcg levels, post-surgery conception), a miscarriage sounds likely. I'm very sorry.
qImMwhUHaa	Mine never really went away but they did fade a lot over time.  I only got them with my first child and they just kind of appeared again with baby 2 and 3 and just fade away again. There isn't really a whole lot you can do for stretch marks. You can get some vitamin E capsules and open them up and rub in the area's of you stretch marks to help them fade faster.|`|IjcdwJiMaa	i got them sooo bad!  they r all over my hole belly, and they r wide, its bn almost 3yrs since ive had my son & they haven't faded much, but mine r a bad case, ive never seen any1 with 1s like mine, yours will likely fade!|`|Qd5fQpMYaa	My stretch marks are horrible. I noticed them at about 20 weeks. They are about 5 or 6 inches from the bottom of my belly up to my belly button, and everyday I pretty much notice a new little one. I've tried EVERYTHING. But, I had them on my sides and breasts before I was pregnant and those faded so much you can barely even tell. One thing that I noticed that helped was when I would get a tan. They would be very red for a day or two and then when the redness went away my stretch marks were less noticeable.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	I noticed I started to get some towards the very end of my first pregnancy and they faded away after delivery.  I also put coco butter on like a mad woman.  I have been doing the same with this pregnancy (24 weeks) and have not seen any, yet (fingers crossed :-)|`|SIrmqu5maa	I'm almost 37 weeks and I'm having the same problem. Might are really really dark and I'm brown. I'm using palmers cocoa butter and they seem to be fading!|`|b5a53add137e28d77c3cdf426b5f6a2aaa	I got pretty bad ones with my daughter.  i just put lotion on them and they have faded but the couple that were really deep are still noticeable.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I didn't notice any stretchmarks until after I had my daughter.  They do fade in time, but i still have reddish-purple ones on my inner thighs and my daughter is 6 years old.  The ones on my stomach, hips, and outer thighs all faded to silvery-white.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	I got stretch marks pretty bad with my son ... but most of them have faded .. although they're still noticeable on my stomach and boobs because of how bad they were and how much weight i gained.
87f8699fae346ba5d63a2c44b54e0151aa	Some women have trouble delivering a  6lb. baby; others have no problem delivering a 12 lb. baby. Size of the baby has little to do with it.    When you are pregnant, hormones help loosen the bones of your pelvis. Not only is your pelvis flexible, but the baby's head will mold and his fatty parts will "squish". There is no way for anyone to know if your baby will "fit" until you have gone into labor and tried. Inducing (while it may produce a baby that is slightly smaller than if you had waited until baby was ready to be born) can actually cause the baby to get stuck in a bad position because of the stronger than normal contractions. And epidurals not only can make it difficult for you to push, they almost always require you to push on your back or tailbone, which is the position that constricts the pelvis the most. If you are concerned about baby fitting through your hips, an upright position such as squatting is best.     http://www.transitiontoparenthood.com/tt...|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	If you have the epidural it should be really easy.  I delivered a 9lb porker and I felt absolutely nothing, he came out 10 mins after i started pushing.  I think you're underestimating yourself!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I had a hard time delivering a 9 lb baby. (My first) My second 6 1/2 years later was 8 lbs on the dot and it took 2 pushes.    Keep in mind those ultrasounds can go 1 lb or so either way. Congrats and good luck! =)|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i was over 8 pounds and my mother had me naturally [not by choice, she wanted an epidural but they wouldnt give her one]. she had no trouble with me whatsoever, they could tell she was about to rip though so she did have an episiotomy.    at my ultrasound at 28 weeks my baby measured to be over 3 pounds ALREADY...so i know im going to have a big baby =]|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	my son was born at 8 lbs . 6 oz and i managed to survive lol.  you'll do fine.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i know a tiny girl who delivered an 11 pounds 2 ounce baby. and another girl who is 4'11 about 85 pounds and pushed out a 9 pounds baby- at 5 cm your water will probably break soon   mine did once i was walking around 6 cm|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	You have less than a week left! That's not that bad. And dilated to five already? Wow. Personally I wouldn't bother with an epi because you're halfway there! Good for you! You might find that at that rate, you don't even need it! :)    Anything between 6-9 lbs is considered average weight. So try not to worry. babies gain on average half pound a week, and ultrasound measurements *can* be off by half a pound or more either way. Some women are told their baby is 'huge' and then end up getting talked into c-section because of it, only to deliver a 6 lb baby. So you never know. Try not to panic and just see what happens. You'll do great!    ETA: I still can't believe you're already dilated to five ... wow! Lucky you! Is this your first? Here's to an awesome delivery! :D|`|tapFZBowaa	You are going to be just fine........I am on the small side and my son was 8lbs 8oz, and I had an amazingly easy delivery (I did have an epidural.)  Try to stay calm and know that it is just a blink in the lifetime of experiences you will have with your baby....no need to be afraid!|`|rAkWoweOaa	I am 5'10'' and my son was 8lbs 8ozs. I had a fourth degree tear and forceps. Just warning you, not trying to scare you. You will be fine! lol|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	Well, i'm not a mother so I don't know for sure. I was 7 lbs and my mom said that giving birth wasn't too bad. Then came my brother @ 10 lbs. Yeah, she had some trouble but not too much (she still gave a natural delivery at a birth center), but my mom has big bones and (i'm guessing) big hips, too.|`|remZ5gDUaa	My 2nd was 8lbs 2oz. And she was my easiest labor. Less than 2 hours start to finish and I'm little. I'm 5'2" and bak then was 110lbs. Remember the u/s are just a guesstimate and can be off by as much as a pound or 2.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	ultrasound are so off most of the time...with my 1st they said over 9lbs and with my 2nd they said just under 5lbs and both were just under 8lbs...and just because you are small don't mean anything...My friend is 5'2" and is a 140lbs at 9 months pregnant and her baby was 8lbs 14 and she had no trouble...just make sure to get the epidural..so worth it...|`|Q9qno7EVaa	I wouldn't worry about what they say your baby's weight is, 3 weeks before I was due they told me my little one was right on the average line with all measurements. So asked how big an average baby weighs the Dr said about high 7 pounds to low 8 pounds. When my baby was born 3 weeks later 2 days before her due date she only weighed 6 pound 7 oz. So they can be wrong it's just a guess at this stage. But I'm sure you'll be fine, my cousin is short and has small hips and both her kids were over 8 pounds. Good luck and enjoy motherhood.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	My daughter was 8lb 14oz.  I had a 6 hour easy birth.|`|DLDweOcYaa	My baby was 3 weeks early and thank god she only weighed 6lbs 13oz.  I came out in about 5 to 6 pushes.  Not sure how heavy this baby will be.  Hopefully no more than 8lbs..lol|`|YeWl5L0saa	my mom is 5'3, and i was eight pounds too. she was fine. just take the epidural.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	my first baby was 8lb 12ozs second baby was 8lb 14ozs and third was 9lb 6 ozs and all the births were normal,had a few stitches after the first,please don't worry you will be fine,take care and good luck chick xx|`|awRNr2VMaa	8 lbs is just an estimate it can be either 3 lbs over or 3 lbs less and usually its less. your body was made for making babies. i think youll be perfectly fine!|`|hGqQIusSaa	My daughter was 8lbs 3oz and 20 inches long.  It was a pretty easy labor (thanks to epidural!) but I did tear and received 3 stitches.|`|IR21UpMeaa	dont worry.  If you are having the epidural you wont feel a thing anyway!  they are absolute bliss!  Wow you are already 5cm dilated.  I was a fingertip dilated and in agony!      Dont worry about size either they told me there was no way I was having a 9lb baby (as my first was 9lb 3oz) they told me it was about 7lb.  He was actually 9lb 6oz!!    Just stop worrying about it and just let nature take its course.  there are plenty of pain killers and if they didnt think your hips were big enough they would have told you.    My friends baby was 12 lb 3oz and she only had gas and air!  ouch! lol    good luck|`|5Crovdoaaa	All three of my boys were over 10 lbs at birth, and I was able to. It's amazing how your body will shift around to make room for the baby You'll be fine!.|`|heDtLdz5aa	don't be afraid...i had an ultra sound to determine my babies size about a week and a half before my due date...they estimated about 8 ibs 5 oz....wow you are dialted to 5.. i was in the hospital at 4 and my water was buldging(this was the day before my due date) i fully dialated and effaced...but my son was too big to make it past my pelvis  i ended up with a c-section ( i was scared to death) but to be honest it really wasn't all that bad...my baby was born healthy..that is what is important..he was 9 ibs 1 oz...22 and half inches long...recovery is a little longer than vaginal birth...but i promise if you end up with a c-section you are not any less of a mother...good luck and congrats and get as much rest as possible now!!!!|`|siDcjgJCaa	My mom who is NOT a large woman deliver two 10lb + babies. Me on the other hand... I could not deliver my 9lb 5oz baby. I was a c-section. So it really depends on you.. everyone is different. Try not to worry right now.. just relax as much as possible... and c-sections are not that bad, I had a very pleasant experience... I wish you the best and congrats.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I had the epidural and I couldn't imagine going through labour without it. My daughter was 7 lbs, 12 oz and 21 '' long and I had no trouble at all. I only pushed for 40 minutes.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	My son was 8lbs 11oz...I had the epidural and pushed him out in 45 minutes. I did end up with a 4th degree tear which is basically a tear from front to back, but they gave me plenty of medicine for the pain and within 2 weeks I felt much better. Trust me, it's do-able.|`|035f0c618509868724b99b045ce88d86aa	i gave birth to both of my 8 pounders with ease. i had no need for drugs or an epidural. i would only get the epidural if the labor is not progressing along quickly as sometimes first birth labors can tend to be a bit longer. do plenty of  research on medicated childbirth so you can have a good idea what to expect. with any intervention you get there are always some sort of risks. just try to picture that sweet little baby that you will be holding soon and not to worry so much. good luck!|`|hFoYmSgqaa	my little one was 10lb 6oz and 58cm long at birth, i had a low dose epidural, i didn't feel a thing and slept through four hours of labour i have small hips but that doesn't make any difference. you might tear and need stitches but you should be alright. i was induces at 38 +1 as i had been in labour for about a week but only first stage and no progression which is pretty normal in my family as is big babies.|`|sAAnquoTaa	My daughter was 8lbs 8ozs and I was able to push her out. She did rip me quite bad though. Not to scare you, just letting you know.     You'll be fine and if you can't push him out they can take him out for you and it'll be okay.|`|my6AKy6Eaa	Well this is just the question for me. I am 22 and I am 5'1 and I was 115 before I got pregnant when I went into labor I was 160 I gained alot of weight with my son. He ended up being 8lbs 10oz and I had a perfect delivery. I was dilated to a 4 when I went into the hospital and they gave me a shot of Demerol on the side of my butt with in an hour my water broke they gave me an epidural which I was kind of out of it from the Demerol so I didn't feel it. It went in just fine and I highly recommend an epidural they are amazing I didn't feel a thing after I got mine. But we waited til about 12 and I started feeling my contractions again and they came in and noticed that he had slowly started coming out on his own and that's what I was feeling so at 1:17 am he was born and I am a tiny girl. So I wouldn't think you should have worries. Oh and he was 2 days late he was due on the 14th but came the 16th.   I really hope I helped.    good luck and congrats!|`|bql2RJzWaa	I thought you can't have an epidural after 5cm dilated...?   Chances are, your baby will be more then 8lbs. (My friend's baby was supposed to be 9lbs & ended up being 10lbs 5oz)   If I were you, I'd be very careful of being induced. Especially when you are already so dilated. An induction will make things for you happen REALLY fast. Doctors make stupid decisions sometimes!.  I was induced with both my kids. 2x with the first & 3x with the 2nd. My 2nd came 3 weeks early (b/c high bp). I was FORCED to have her. She was 7-15. It wasn't so bad. It's gonna hurt anyway;)  But you, your body is getting ready...I think if you are going to do an induction, you should see if you can get it sooner then later  Good luck!
kBp9IzQqaa	I did....|`|vwTyihvvaa	Troll... again.|`|AA10148924	Story. I was girl number five and child number six. One morning I got up with a bad stomach ache. My oldest sister yells out, "Martha started her peroid." For the next four years, I never told anyone I was having my peroid. I would use toilet paper and rags instead of pads. No, I would not have told anyone. Be kind to children.|`|biqMTkWbaa	Thanks 4 the points!|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I did tell my "mommy" I got my period.

I would just tell her, there is a chance that she already knows that. Just tell her that you need to go to the store to   get some girly things.
m0a7Ox1maa	I have yet to read anyone on here proclaim they got pregnant that way.  If you did - this would be a virgin birth - they are not common.  Don't worry, I HIGHLY doubt your pregnant.|`|dbyLDPwmaa	Well just wait till u miss about 2 weeks then go  BUY a pregnancy test......|`|ndIOfnvUaa	your pregnant.....
o2QlBvfraa	Yes you can.  In fact, you can still get pregnant while on your period.  Though I have no idea why anyone would want to have sex during that time...|`|VUNfI7yBaa	I doubt it|`|h6cYQaxYaa	My husband and I use the rhythm method and two days before your period you are not ovulating so you have very very little chance of being pregnant.|`|zuzQn1hEaa	NO! There's nothing to impregnate if your on your period.|`|lrtttuwcaa	your most likely not to get pregnant but u mite can but I never heared no one getting pregnant if they came on two days after having sex. u ok i think so but u would just have to wait and see.
ttbho89Vaa	just say something like "mama wants to make your hair look pretty like a princess" or something like that. haha i have 1 boy so i wouldn't know:]|`|AA11981363	I can relate, just tell her she will look beautiful and after you are done praise her lots about how princess like she looks. It works here LOL|`|tapFZBowaa	try getting her upside down over a couch....it makes it a game and you can still get to her hair!  Good Luck!|`|awRNr2VMaa	youll have to make it a game. say you want to play with her hair and let her play with yours. or if its just one ponytail have your husband hold her and put her hair up a minute. shes old enough to know what stay here means so just try to get her to stay just long enough for a ponytail|`|uj1A73ZGaa	Make it a game. Maybe let her play with your hair and than tell her you want to make her look like a princess. I work at a children's salon and we have lots of kids we have to tell them that we want to make them look like a prince or princess.  My oldest daughter is two and she loves getting her hair done. My twins are still little they don't care what I do with their hair.    Good luck
4PgkqTfzaa	just stopped stressing and it will come, by u stressing about it, its difficult to get pregnant .  try getting a hobbie to get your mind off things like stitching for example or book reading.  that's wat im trying to do. ive been trying 2 years now.  hope this helped good luck baby dust to both of us.|`|lrtttuwcaa	I STAY COM AND GO SEE A DOCTOR AGAIN BECASUE STRESSING CAN GIVE YOU GIVE YOU A SIES ON YOUR OVIRS THA TCAN STOP YOUR EGGS FROM FLOWING TO GET YOU PREGNANT.|`|GcJszsMnaa	I'd try a lil more then if nothing...Then go to the doctor...K good luck hun! Baby dust your way!|`|FjGeKhY0aa	The tests just showed that your body is ready but are you ovulating at all? Maybe the ovulation days aren't when you think they are. First step, I would get an ovulation kit and see, then go to ask a doctor for advice. Good luck!|`|S9aY6xLKaa	You should probably get tested for fertility problems and maybe start some kind of treatments.  Thirteen months seems like too long to be trying without any results.

Foster kids eat any normal foods that are appropriate for their age.  Foster kids shouldn't live in homes without parents. Most foster parents are good people and take care of the children.
Fd4lITkvaa	I have a 10 month old but am in Kansas City. We have a play group we meet with but all of the kids are older than my son, 1.5-2.5yrs old. I found them on meetup.com and yahoo groups. I also wish I had more babies my son's age around. I only know one and mom works long hours so it's rare that we get together.|`|TVC3mAP7aa	I'm not in NY, but I've had luck through our local library's storytime.  Also, check with your school district to see if they offer any early childhood education programs.  We have a "daycare"-type setting that we can bring our kids to, to play with other kids.

AA11185897	Only One Way To Find Out.      test test test|`|pUnjP0Jyaa	lol whats already pregnancy mean?if you think your pregnanat take a test imean we on ya cant tell you wats wronq with your menastration honey we dont have the pregnancy radar book an appt with your obgyn or something!
rmse6Mj8aa	this doesnt sound like pregnancy. it sounds like a virus.  if she is on the pill she is not ovulating so she most likely can not have conceived. she has already had a period which indicates that she most likely is not pregnant.  take her to the doctor she needs medical care whether she is pregnant or  just sick.  we on yahoo can only offer opinions, and she ought to be seen by a medically qualified person who can better answer your concerns.     good luck|`|3aqm1SDbaa	I don't think she is pregnant, you two seem very careful and that's a REALLY good thing. I would say she has the flu or a virus, have her go to her regular doctor.|`|lBNXznCeaa	There is a good possibility she isnt but also remember that birth control pills are not 100% effective when it comes to pregnancy. After a while the female body gets used to the pills and the possibilities of pregnancy may increase. If anything I would recommend you to buy a pregnancy test. If your girlfriend is not willing to go to the doctor that is your next best option. Beware that birth control pills also cause effects such as the ones you are stating above. In many girls there may be a weight increase or loss. It varies. Good luck|`|j9nhk1v2aa	Sounds like she has the flu. But its best to go to the doctor just so things can be clear and concise.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Don't worry. It sounds like your gf just has the flu. You guys are protecting yourselves very well, and she had her period, so the chances are very unlikely. good luck.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Your girlfriend has the flu.
KHZLPldraa	Nope because my almost 17month old decides when she wants to respond to her name and her pediatrician said the stubbornness starts earlier in some children vs others.  LOL|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes, its is concerning.  It should be immediate with no delays.  My son didn't respond at 9 months and was promptly diagnosed with autism.  My son has other things going on too, like poor eyecontact etc.  My son is now 3 and was dx by a neurologist at 9 months.  After my first concerns I took this assessment questionnaire and got borderline results of 49, over 50 is significant for an autistic spectrum disorder.  I took this with me to the neurologist.  This assessment will give you an idea if he is at risk for an autism spectrum disorder.  My non autistic son scores in the low 20's so it isn't even close.    http://www.childbrain.com/pddassess.html    Firstly, go to an audiologist and have his hearing tested.  Also call early intervention, they will come out and assess him and for free you need no referral.  They will look at his developmental levels in all areas.  If he has a delay they will begin therapy for him.  All of my kids have gone through early intervention.|`|AA11981363	NOPE! some babies are just stubborn. My own one loves to mess with me a lot! LOL|`|HH6Z3jQ0aa	my twin sisters dont really respond to their name and they are a month and a half so i wouldnt worry about it she or he will get used to it|`|xV0APOtaaa	It's called Selective Hearing. They hear you when they want to. The idea that he can hear you right away means there is nothing wrong with his hearing, but that what he's watching, playing with, etc. is better than stopping to see what you want mommy.
QRHufyHiaa	i would wait and take another test with your first pee of the morning. many things can make a test wrong. such as possibly drinkin alot before you take the test or other things. wait a few and take it in the morning. good luck!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	it is so hard to say as almost all those symptoms could easily be pms. the metallic taste could a preg sig, as could the discharge.    if you are going to test early don't test in the afternoon as your pee is more diluted. the best time to test is with your first morning urine and use a really sensitive pregnancy test such as a first response.   you may just be pms-ing and your period is around the corner or you may well have early preg signs, and tested at the wrong time.    take a morning test as i say, in about 2 days if your period hasnt arrived. your hcg levels should be doubling every 2 days so keep testing until you either get a period or a positive test.     it might be worth a visit to the doctor? they can do a blood test     good luck|`|hJkM8Lygaa	I would do another test, but maybe go to your doctor for a more accurate reading...  It may just be a late period for whatever reason. Morning sickness is the name but it doesn't always have to happen in mornings!  Breasts get sore because of the milk starting to fill the breast - so it probably wouldn't happen that fast...  I wouldn't worry too much until you have done another test.     Its good to know also people have perios when pregnant sometimes- so if you think you have put yourself in the situation where you could have gotten pregnant, keep doing tests just incase!     x x|`|pAsdcjcoaa	sounds like MAYBE you could.. take another test in a few days in the morning. you could just be late because your worrying about it.|`|1whTwTbDaa	You could have conceived late in the month...wait a few more days then retest. It sounds like you are having the symptoms of a pregnant woman...or you could just be getting ready for a late period. Good luck!|`|kbP32zIUaa	i would do another test, it sounds as if you have conceived this month.. look out for more signs such as    - lower abdominal pain  - headaches  - tiredness    you signs sound like pregnany so i would take another test, make sure its in the morning as you have more pregnancy hormones at that time x    btw* do not bother visiting you doctor, there tests are exactly the same as any in the shop.. ( my dad is a doctor )|`|I4uIOp1maa	do another test just to make sure, but it snds like ur not so dnt worry too much. Tell your mum too cos she mgiht help  gd luck

CuTvFlxTaa	Ive still got my tummy 10 years on... baby number 3 in there now. I call it my mushroom top when I have my jeans on.Or my rank when Im feeling low about it. The muscles in your stomach have been stretched. You will have to work real hard to get them back into shape. If it really bothers you consider the drastic option of surgery, if not do loads of sit ups and eat healthily. Failing that learn to love it and think positive that it did the most important job in the world...carried your baby.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	You need to exercise your core muscles. It's the best way to get your muscles back and work the flab off. You can look up plenty of them online or there is zone pilates, the bender method is a good one but you really just need an exercise ball. The dvd is pointless. Basically all you do is crunches on it. Good luck!|`|rTAvnldfaa	i was massive when i was preg with my first and my belly overhanged afterwards, i got active, went to the gym three days a week ate well, and lost 5 stone. it was still slightly wrinkled and drawn in but not overhanging at all, (i was slightly overweight too, not just belly which why so much weight) im now preg with second so hopefully a more sensible diet while pregnant will help me this time.    unfortunately if yours was like mine and very stretch marked it is very hard to get the tautness back, the best way is a lot of excercise.xx|`|qImMwhUHaa	It just kind of goes back into place.

KeevlZnTaa	I have known children as young as three years old beginning piano. If you child is young than you need to choose a teacher that is experienced in teaching toddlers. Not all teachers will teach children as young as three(it takes a lot of patience and repetition to teach a child that young. Be sure to get references and ask questions.|`|hn5rnGgxaa	I would recommend at least in first grade. Children should be able to do simple math and reading before taking lessons. Do you have a teacher in mind? Ask them what they think. I was 7 when I started.|`|P37lIBr2aa	I was 7 when I first starting taking lessons. I'm sure you can start as young as 5 though. My piano teacher had a few 5 year olds at the time. I found I learned much better when I was younger and had more time for it. Once I got to middle school it was difficult with my dance and sports classes to keep up.|`|O8Kf27TSaa	I was 5 but then I quit. It was fun at first slamming hands on key board and playing the low keys when someone was already playing it.  Haha Good times :)|`|LDymSz96aa	I would say 7 or 8.

UHXqLtpraa	I am a only child and my parents are almost 50 so me having siblings is out of the question. I do have a half-brother but I don't really know him. I would really like a sibling but again its out of the picture now. It can be really lonely cause sometimes you have no one to talk to . So when I get older I will not have just one child because I think it is really hard sometimes because I am not spoiled but I am a only child so I lose both ways...|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I am an only child. After I was over 18 I gained some step-siblings.    I don't think its hard being an only child.

I'm very close to my mom because of being an only child I think.    Couldn't agree less with the poster who thinks single children grow up selfish. Being a selfish person has nothing to do with if you have siblings or not but more with how your parents raised you and what morals/values they taught you.    It also doesn't reduce the interest in having kids. I fully plan on having a large family (5-6).|`|ToztjpAsaa	I was an only child and I hated it.

It is going to differ from situation to situation. For some one child is all they want or can have, there is nothing wrong with that. "Fair" doesn't really come in to play in this one, for me anyway, all children will be loved whether or not they have a sibling, so what does it matter?|`|gmaCvh00aa	I'm one of 7.  My daughter is a "one kid", as she put it when she was small.  She didn't like it when she was little, but at 17 she is glad because of the advantages it gave her.    It's not a matter of fair or not, lol.  I would have liked to have more, but I had to get divorced.    Only children are usually high achievers.

43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	Sorry but you cant out a baby on a schedule especially a breastfed baby since she needs to nurse on demand to benefit herself and your supply.  Buy a sling or carrier and let her nurse on you still in your arms but your hands are free to type and go about what you need to do.  My daughter would only sleep on me too for the first few months and the sling saved my life! lol I know it's hard but you can force a newborn into a schedule, she's just too young and dependent on you right now.|`|rFtKFp03aa	do cry it out with her..

Instead, get a Moby Wrap (or another similar carrier) and you can work while she nurses and naps.  I did plenty of that when my son was little.
bjHggKmfaa	Well your weight may have a tiny bit to do with it, but not much at all.  Women's periods are irregular all the time, it's not uncommon.  You should go on the Pill, your mom is right.  It does regulate your cycles, plus it makes them lighter and shorter.   And going on the Pill doesn't mean you're a slut or anything.  I went on the Pill when I was 13, and I wasn't even sexually active. I'm very grateful now that my parents put me on it.  Plus the Pill has more benefits to it, acne fighting, reducing PMS etc.  Your period will be perfectly regular and shorter after three months straight of taking it.  It's a very good thing to be on and it makes you feel safe when you become sexually active.  The Pill may have take a bad rap, but once you're on it you feel a lot better.  Hopefully this helps.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would go on the pill I had to when I was younger and now I don't have any problems. As  for having kid someday well I have 1 already|`|F2JEvYX7aa	it is very common to have irregular periods, nothing can really help that other than going on the pill. Your heavy flow can be helped by going on the pill. Having irregular periods will not effect your fertility.|`|mCDopsLEaa	you should definately see a gyno. you may have pcos.|`|W1p6LetFaa	My sister still does not have regular periods and she is a freshman in college (18 years old).  In fact, she didn't even GET her period until she was 16.  Consider yourself lucky, haha.  Otherwise, yes, birth control might help regulate your cycles but it has other side effects, such as weight gain (as you mentioned) and even a lot of unpleasant side effects that are similar to pregnancy.  I personally would not go on birth control unless I actually needed it for birth control.  Good luck to you!|`|8Kwwgtvlaa	Maybe she should take you to a Dr. surely the three of you can come up with a better solution than the pill.|`|eeyGYRcPaa	i started when i was 12. and at 19 i went on birth control because i still wasn't regular and i had really heavy periods. through those 7 years i was anorexic as well as bulimic. my mom brought up birth control and i told her no way in hell because i couldn't gain weight. well i got pregnant with my ex who left then miscarried and realized i wasn't ready for a baby. so i looked into birth control and decided i'd stop the second i started to gain weight. i was on ortho tri cyclin lo and i kept expecting to gain an insane amout of weight which was like 3 lbs for me. but i never gained any! in fact i lost 7! and if you do gain weight they say it's only a few lbs and will most likely go away! but regardless it helped my period, my cramps, my fatigue everything! i had such manageable periods! they were amazing! my period was light and lasted 2 to 4 days. just because you MIGHT gain weight isn't a reason not to be on birth control... trust me you'll be much happier if you do. :D|`|NtcezzKEaa	I think it would be smart to look into the pill.. It was the best thing I could have ever done for my cycles.. Good Luck|`|phAqOpzZaa	I never had regular periods when i first got my period at 16...now i'm 19 and there still screw up...but i wont lie its pretty hard to get prego w/irregular periods! cause we dont know when we ovulate...|`|GZrR0uxjaa	when you are this young your periods still seem to stay irregular, i started my first period when i was 12 years old, i am almost 19 years old now and they finally found some regularity...so just wait a little while more, and if not the pill really is the only way to go to regulate cycles...unless your doctor can prescribe you something else...|`|rev4lrn0aa	I've never gained weight from being on the pill, just don't do the shot. If you start to gain weight, see if they can put you on a different type of pill - there a million different brands that have different side effects but you won't know until you try because everyone is different. If you go on the pill it will regulate you period as well as making it shorter and lighter. =)|`|Fx77zYhWaa	The pill will help your period be more regular/predictable and it won't last as long or be as heavy.  There's no solid link between the pill and weight gain.  It won't mess up your fertility in the future either.    Some people never get regular.  I never had a straight 28 day cycles and there was a time I went 8 weeks without one (thank god I wasn't sexually active or I might've freaked out).  It wasn't until I went on the pill that my period got regular.|`|3aqm1SDbaa	It is worth looking into the pill or just going to the doctor to discuss your options with them. Being a little overweight isn't the end of the world, and the myth that you gain weight when you go on birth control isn't true at least that's what my doc told me. She said that most girls go onto the pill as soon as they graduate high school or are going to college or first become involved in a serious relationship, all of which can cause weight gain. Don't be worried about your weight be worried about your future.
YJNql5Mgaa	Ask your doctor. Some only do it if it's medically needed.  Others won't do Elective C-sections.    Besides, the recovery is MUCH longer and harder than a vaginal birth. You have your trade off.  Would you rather have a little more pain during the delivery or more pain for weeks longer after the birth?|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Yea, I think you can.  But, if I were you go for the little bit of pain before an epidural and skip the C section scar.  no matter how small it may be.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	i begged my dr. for one and he kept telling me he wouldn't recommend it if i didn't need it and finally i gave in and decided to bite the bullet and have a regular delivery. i did have an epidural though and sure enough i did it. i was so proud and i was up and moving around that day with no pain unlike c-sec. patients who are in alot of pain for a week or 2|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	nope sorry most drs won't do a c-section unless it is medically needed. You are adding more complications & possible dangers by having an unneeded c-section. Plus you just about triple your recovery time.     Suck it up and have as natural as possible so you and your baby are safe, you got yourself pregnant!!!!|`|tmh42R6Caa	Yes.  The AMA has decided that any woman who feels it is safer to have a c-section than to deliver vaginally is entitled to a c-section.  There are pros and cons to each, so talk to you doctor about it.  Also, your insurance may not cover a voluntary c-section, but the doctor can't say no.|`|eHow24rNaa	You can talk to your doctor and tell her that you want a c-section. My doctor asked me if i wanted it natural or section and i told her natural unless i needed to have a section, which i did have a section b/c my baby was turning sideways and i wasnt dialating past 4cm...and also, my sister in law was 18 when she had her baby and had it vaginal and she said it didnt hurt but it burned a little bit...its not that bad...good luck|`|NAzAmFDnaa	Honey, the pain is fairly short lived.  Seriously.  After I pushed out my 8.7lb baby with no painkillers, I was WALKED by my nurse to my post-partum room.  The pain was over and I had a baby.  With a c-section, you will be sore for weeks, uncomfortable to sit or stand.  Holding the baby will be difficult.  Bending over will be difficult.  My mom had a c-section 28 years ago and still has pains in her scar every once in awhile.  You can have an epidural and take away the pain during labor, but for the sake of your baby, don't injure yourself any more than necessary.  Baby needs you to feel as healthy as possible to be a good mommy and if you can avoid a c-section, you'll feel so much better.|`|PF2FBKBDaa	sure yu can, pay doctor money first and he do cut baby out|`|Fx77zYhWaa	There are some doctors that might let you get an elective one but a good doctor will only give a c-section to someone when it's medically necessary or the person's already had one.  Also it'll cost more and your mom's insurance company might not cover it if there's no reason for it.|`|w7BeIKhZaa	no offense sweetie but having a c section because YOU dont want to go through the pain of natural birth is pretty selfish ( hello hunny epidural..you cant feel much because of it anyways) and in the long run youll regret it...i have had a c section..they are harder to heal from and it hurts for a while afterwards...not to mention youll ruin your stomach..it is harder to get your belly the way it was before pregnancy because they cut across those muscles and you end up having a flabby peice of skin for a long time until you tone it up which is HARD..in other words..think twice before deciding to get one..natural birth is easier to heal from and your stomach gets back in shape faster, plus no pain afterwards.|`|AA10148924	The truth is is you have one, it takes much longer to heal and you are in more pain for a long period of time. Plus you do not lose the weight as fast. I had both of my children natural and never regretted it. Nope, not even a pain shot and my pain tolerance is low. I was wearing my regular clothes within a week with my first baby and I actually walked out of the hospital in my regular clothes with my second. C sections are not good for you and limit the amount of children you can have. You will never regret having natural birth.|`|iqpa6W7qaa	why dont you get a epidural? C-section hurt just as bed, trust me... i had one 7 months ago.... it still hurts!!!
q7sgWqZ3aa	My baby has a two vessel cord. I had to go to a specialist and have a level 2 ultrasound done to do a major check through. He checked the baby's heart and kidneys and both were fine. He said that when someone comes in with a 2 vessel cord that those are the major things to check to see if they are fine. This happened last weeks so its still fresh in my mind.    I know down syndrome has been linked to a 2 vessel cord. My regular doctor told me that a 2 vessel cord is actually fairly common in pregnancies and can mean nothing or it could mean a chromosome problem, which is why he sent me to the specialist to get that looked at.      My regular doctor also told me that in some cases a baby is born and it is discovered that it's umbilical cord had a 2 vessel cord and they check the baby over for anything that is related to having a 2 vessel cord.    The specialist said that sometimes the 2 vessel cord is actually a 3 vessel cord that the ultrasound tech didn't get a good picture of. Usually if you get sent to a genetics place to get a level 2 ultrasound, the equipment is much more sophisticated then the regular doctors, meaning better clearer results.    It's likely your doctor will send you to a specialist to get a better look at the umbilical cord to see if its one of those that sometimes occur in pregnancy and don't mean anything.    Its likely that after you have your baby, there will be a pediatrician on hand to look over your baby and then the umbillical cord will be examimed.  That's what my doc told me anyway.    Your doctor might also suggest prenatal testing procedures like: amniocentesis.    Amniocentesis is a procedure in which amniotic fluid is removed from the uterus for testing or treatment. Amniotic fluid is the fluid that surrounds and protects a baby during pregnancy. This fluid contains fetal cells and various chemicals produced by the baby.     With genetic amniocentesis, a sample of amniotic fluid is tested for certain abnormalities  such as Down syndrome and spina bifida. With maturity amniocentesis, a sample of amniotic fluid is tested to determine whether the baby's lungs are mature enough for birth. Occasionally amniocentesis is used to evaluate a baby for infection or other illness. Rarely, amniocentesis is used to decrease the volume of amniotic fluid.   It is done for differnt reason at different stages of pregnancy.    I wasn't offered that because the specialist doctor didn't see anything wrong with the baby and so I didn't have to make the decision on wherether to go with aminocentesis.    I would talk to your doctor about your concerns and let him/her reassure you. I'm suprised he/she didn't tell you some of the bith defects/chromosome problems sometimes that are linked to a 2 vessel cord. My doctor was very straight forward and laid it out on the table for us. He did say that in most cases it just one of those things that happens in pregnancy that don't mean anything.|`|YJNql5Mgaa	My friend did and her daughter was just fine. :)|`|1whTwTbDaa	I've never experienced this...but I just wanted to ask...how is the baby thriving? This sounds really weird to me. I don't think that the baby could survive if there was not 3 vessels to the cord. How odd! Good luck! I am sorry you are having difficulties!|`|9hrJfhIIaa	What is single umbilical artery?  About 1 percent of singleton and about 5 percent of multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets or more) have an umbilical cord that contains only two blood vessels, instead of the normal three. In these cases, one artery is missing (2). The cause of this abnormality, called single umbilical artery, is unknown.    Studies suggest that babies with single umbilical artery have an increased risk for birth defects, including heart, central nervous system and urinary-tract defects and chromosomal abnormalities (2, 3). A woman whose baby is diagnosed with single umbilical artery during a routine ultrasound may be offered certain prenatal tests to diagnose or rule out birth defects. These tests may include a detailed ultrasound, amniocentesis (to check for chromosomal abnormalities) and in some cases, echocardiography (a special type of ultrasound to evaluate the fetal heart). The provider also may recommend that the baby have an ultrasound after birth.
AA10172433	Obviously the problem isn't lack of sleep or regimen, and I'm going to assume that you don't have this problem on the weekend. The problem is NOT you; it's school. You've probably heard the saying "not even wanting to get out of bed in the morning." It refers to life being so unpleasant and undesirable that you don't even want to face it; you'd rather just stay in bed.    This is no way to live. You should be experiencing life in such an exciting way that you can't WAIT to get out of bed in the morning! Each day should bring brand new adventures and pleasures. Are you really happy going to school? Take some time to think about this. What would you be doing with your time if you didn't have to be there? What would you really love to be doing?    Research unschooling and see if it might be beneficial to you. Also read "Teenage Liberation Handbook." I know this probably wasn't the answer you were expecting, but if you give my solution a chance it could change your life!

Par contre quand nos enfants ne sont qu'avec leurs grands parents, ils les gerent comme ils veulent sauf sur certain point comme l'heure du coucher, la nourriture, etc....    Par exemple chez moi, interdiction d'tre debout sur un canap, chez les GP ils acceptent donc si il s'occupent de mes enfants, ils pourront etre debout sur le canap.

RVr3K5CTaa	Vous avez des rponses diffrentes parce qu'en 20 ans la loi a normment chang sur le sujet donc les gens se basent sur ce qu'ils pensent tre la loi. Et le code civil a subi une grosse modif sur le sujet en 2006.    Aujourd'hui, il n'y a plus plusieurs statuts pour l'enfant (avant, il y avait lgitime, naturel).    Le mariage ou le PACS protge les parents, mais n'ont AUCUN effet sur les enfants.    Attention, cependant au nom des enfants : le premier enfant dtermine le nom de tous les autres. Il faut AVANT la naissance de l'enfant et AVANT la reconnaissance prnatale du pre, dcider du prnom des enfants (nom du pre, nom de la mre, les deux noms accols). Vous ne pourrez plus changer ensuite (mme en vous mariant)    Par contre, si protger les enfants, c'est protger le parent survivant en cas de dcs d'un des parents, alors oui, le mariage est la seule solution (le PACS n'apporte rien)    Quand on se retrouve avec des enfants en bas-age en devant grer la succession de l'autre o tout va aux enfants, ?a peut tre difficile (on doit avoir l'autorisation d'un juge, on se retrouve avec de l'argent  grer ou des biens qui coutent de l'argent sans en avoir la jouissance donc sans que ?a rapporte de l'argent, sans compter qu'il est souvent catastrophique pour les enfants de se retrouver avec de l'argent le jour des 18 ans, ?a gnre des checs d'tudes ou qu'on peut se retrouver  la rue quand l'ain atteint 18 ans)    Si vous ne vous mariez pas, faites au moins un testament.|`|NZREB0kkaa	Nous ne sommes pas mari et notre enfant est protg.    Nous avons souscrit das assurances au cas o nous disparaitrions tous les deux, nous avons galement dsign un tuteur lgal en accord avec celui-ci.    Pour info : nous n'avons pas l'intention de nous marier !|`|92d7033714e0bd2be381cfb22f6afcd8aa	plus de nos jours.Le code civil ne fait plus de difference entre les enfants naturels et les enfants lgitimes. la seule chose est de bien penser  le reconnaitre et cela peut se faire avant la naissance.  Mais au niveau des droits tu auras les mmes que dans le cadre d'un mariage ne t'inquites donc pas Vous serez ses parents  fond ceux qui te disent le contraire ne connaissent pas la loi.|`|77e3b6ebb00baeb618248f5dfe035362aa	il suffit les deux parents reconnaissent l'enfant et tt est clair.  c'tait compliqu avant mais les droits sont pareils pour les maris, les pacss, les concubins!|`|a94dde46038ead2dcf68bd8cf14ffa11aa	le code civil a heureusement volu depuis une dizaine d'annes au moins et du moment que l'enfant est reconnu, il a les mmes droits que ses parents soient maris ou pas.  cependant, une reconnaissance trs t?t du papa (au dbut de la grossesse) facilite les droits de l'enfant en cas de problme justement (sparation, dcs, etc...).    la reconnaissance in utero du papa assure les droits de l'enfant en cas de dcs (hritage, pas besoin de testament, en France, les enfants sont les seuls hritiers de droit de leurs parents) mais aussi du papa en cas de sparation des parents.|`|19c9a655639ba01878790a88ac540e36aa	n'coutes pas ceux qui te pousse au mariage pour faire la fte!  la reconnaissance des deux parents suffit!  on est dans la france du XXIme sicle! les enfants sont protgs! ds lors que les parents se sont fait connaitre  leur naissance!    aprs monloulou a raison, l'important pour te rassurer est de prendre une assurance vie dont tes enfants seront les destinataires et trouver quelqu'un capable de s'en occuper au cas o il vous arriverait quelque chose!|`|gh7NYFVoaa	le mariage est primordial|`|LQbEkAccaa	Le mariage va les protg en quoi ?

J'ai pas t mari avec le pre(bio) de ma fille et ma fille est protg quoi qu'il arrive que ce soit au niveau des biens matriaux,assurances (vie,maison,auto),mais le testament est fortement recommand  Le testament servira lors de vos dcs: Qui aura la garde de vos enfant(dire le nom) qui hritera de votre maison,voiture etc si vous voulez que c'est votre enfant vous l'inscrivez et jusqu' ce qu'il aura l'age appropri il pourrait rclam son d?  Vous pouvez faire un test chez vous ou allez voir un notaire qui vous rdigera ou parfois avec votre institution financire vous pouvez aussi avoir le droit de faire un testament,mais il faut vous renseignez!|`|fcee758be0715f930722b7d7502651f4aa	coucou! je ne suis pas marie au papa de ma fille..et si cela nous prend un jour ce ne sera pas du fait de pressions..ton enfant si il est reconnu par ses deux parents ne risque rien! de mon c?t nous avions parl de la reconnaissance anticipe au cas ou il arrive quelque chose au papa avant la naissance...mais nous ne l'avons pas fait..

Aprs, l'important, je crois, est de ne pas l'annoncer tout  trac. Evite de l'annoncer dans un coin de couloir entre deux runions, mais prends le temps de caler un rdv avec ton boss (peut-tre qu'il va avoir peur que tu dmissionnes et sera soulag que tu ne sois "qe" enceinte!! :-) - je plaisante). Du point de vue employeur ce qui fait toute la diffrence c'est que tu arrives au rdv en ayant pens  des solutions : regarder  quelles dates tu seras absente, quels seront les dossiers importants  grer  ce moment l, comment tu pourrais t'organiser avec d'autres personnes ou un futur rempla?ant pour que ces dossiers soient grs. Tu peux aussi indiquer que tu resteras joignable (pas 8h/jour on est d'accord, mais par exemple consulter tes messages 1 fois par jour au cas o ils aient vraiment besoin de toi - ce ne sera pas vrai les premires semaines o tu auras ton bb mais ?a tu n'es pas oblige de le prciser - c'est du vcu :-). Si tu en as la possibilit je te conseille aussi pendant ton cong maternit de ne pas "couper les ponts" avec le boulot. Tu peux par exemple passer une fois par semaine pour djeuner avec ton chef et/ou tes collgues et/ou ton rempla?ant, c'est professionnel et ?a permet qu'on ne "t'oublie" pas, et de prparer ton retour.     Bonne chance...et flicitations, un bb c'est gnial, c'est ?a qui compte avant tout!|`|Z3kXbI2haa	Tu crois qu'il y a un lien de cause  effet ?

"Tu fais ci et je te donne ?a..." cela remet en cause notre autorit, puisqu'il fait ce qu'on lui demande uniquement pour avoir un avantage derrire, et non pour la bonne raison. Je prfre que mon enfant comprenne pourquoi c'est bien qu'il fasse telle ou telle chose, et au pire qu'il le fasse uniquement parce que nous, sa maman ou son papa, on lui a demand. Ce sont les parents qui savent ce qui est le mieux pour lui et qui "commandent" (mme si je n'aime pas ce mot), il doit en tre conscient. Cela revient  poser des limites, c'est ce qui scurise l'enfant. L'enfant n'est pas fou, il voit bien qu'on n'arrive pas  en venir  bout; et qu'on finit par lui promettre quelque chose en retour pour parvenir  se faire couter. Il est en position de force ! et ce n'est pas trs rassurant de voir que ses parents n'arrivent pas  venir  bout d'un petit comme lui, donc il se demande : "alors comment font ils pour me protger ?!?"

But yes, cold water works sometimes, or try ice cream. Sweet stuff usually gets mine going... I am 26 weeks along and he is moving ALL the time. yet, as soon as that ONE hand hits my tummy all movement stops... it is actually kind of hilarious... I am beginning to feel knees or elbows or feet.. whatever "gliding" across the surface of my skin when I lay on my side... it is such a cool feeling next to just the "jabs"     Just don't stress it and he will get plenty of chances to feel it... I have gotten lucky a few times. Something else I will do is kind of "poke" him (which some people think is mean... but it isnt i swear!) to get him to respond back.     Good Luck! and congrats! Its is so much fun when you begin to feel the baby move all around!|`|0IU7kudvaa	Cold water or juice. Sometimes music can make em wiggle.

But I would say that if you just wait a bit... (And I'm a first timer so I'm completely assuming ) That you're son will move more frequently and with more force as the pregnancy progresses.     I'm at 23 wks. and my husband just got to feel his little girl for the first time a couple days ago. We played the same little game. :)|`|g3OIWfcuaa	I have to say I have never heard of cold water but apparently everyone else has. I know orange juice works wonders and so does moving, say getting up to go urinate, that will help as well. I actually have a best friend that is pregnant 28 weeks, her fiance just felt the baby about a week ago. Like I told her, he wont feel it till he is not expecting it, they always seem to stop when someone wants to feel them (stage fright). One other thing you might want to try is letting him talk to the baby, they do respond very well to music and voices. But, I would try the oj thing. Good luck! As other people have said after all you still have 20 weeks, so have fun!|`|26SqFq6Iaa	Yes cold water makes your baby move. I'm 19 weeks and when I don't feel any movements I take out a cold water and start drinking it and I can feel the baby move around in there after a few sips. SOmetimes I tried letting my boyfriend feel our baby move but the baby stops moving when he puts his hand on my tummy and begins moving when he takes it off. Luckily he got to feel the baby move and kick 2 or 3 times already.|`|1ffc303db15fdc00d04d05f7b03f2f53aa	It must because I know they gave my sister-in-law ice chips when they had her hooked up to the fetal monitor to check the baby's movement.  When I was pregnant with my daughter, I had to go twice a week for non-stress-tests.  They hooked me up to a fetal monitor.  Whenever they wanted me to get her to move, I would call my husband on my cell phone, put the phone to my belly and have him talk to our daughter.  It worked all the time, except once.  The doctors office gave me some orange juice to drink and that did the trick.  I don't know if it was the coldness of the drink or the sugar in the juice, but it worked.  I am 24 weeks pregnant again.  I noticed with both pregnancies I am sometimes able to get my babies to move by pressing on my belly with a couple of fingers - especially if I do it after I have felt the baby move.  It's almost like a game we play.

A veces la ansiedad te hace sentir sintomas que confundes con un embarazo.    En mi caso yo ya en la segunda semana comenc a sentir cambios y me realice un test casero y me dio positivo, como supuestamente era muy pronto y la prueba poda haber sido falsa corr al medico para que me ordenara una prueba en sangre quantitativa y ah lo confirme.    En marzo tuve un aborto espontneo y el gineclogo me dijo que deba esperar de dos a tres meses para permitir a mi tero que descanse y que elime por completo las hormonas de embarazo.  Ahora mismo estoy ansiosa porque no pude esperar tanto como tres meses y desde mayo ya comenzamos a buscarlo otra vez y ya me estoy sintiendo un poquito rara, as que vamos a ver.

ufKahy4Oaa	those sound like pregnancy symptoms, and yeah you probably are obsessed with being pregnant! which is why it might be nothing, or a baby, you know the way to find out if your pregnant is to take a hpt. if it says no, wait a week and try again. no's suck, but they are a part of the ttc game. anyway it does soundl like you have pregnancy symptoms and if you are pregnant after your first try i will be so jelouse!   babydust to you and good luck i hope you "pass" the test|`|b2d2c070a260e4000775a62362f7a785aa	i think it is the stress and anxiety about trying to get pregnant that is causing your body to react differently|`|e3721b965ad28715d0e8fe63b00bcf22aa	Calm down...ur gonna jinx yourself if you are.

b8bfb0a0a5268190571fd8bec4bef432aa	Take her/him to the Doctor, don't wait too long.|`|c3dcff4a3f7cc2934c0ee92bae3fa5eeaa	My oldest son does, too.    There are a lot of reasons this can happen, and your child needs to see his doctor about this.  For our part, our son has asthma and allergies, and he would get to coughing so much he threw up.  Often, this happened at night, while he was in his room, and we didn't know what the circumstances were.    With something like recurring vomiting, especially for an unknown reason, you have at least two serious issues to deal with.  First, of course, SOMETHING is causing him to vomit, and that something is not healthy.  Second, frequent vomiting can cause your child to miss out on the nutrients he needs.  You may be feeding him nutrient-rich foods, but if he throws them up before they get a chance to absorb, they are nothing.      Other problems could be that he could have tooth decay with regular vomiting, much like a person who is bulimic, it could affect his daily life.  For example, most preschools will send a child home if he or she is throwing up, so it could effect how much he could interact with others and learn in a school setting.    Take him to his doctor and voice your concerns.  It's the best and safest thing to do.|`|AA12035201	Why? You left out some details.

Dans le rgime gar?on lalimentation de la future maman doit avoir un rapport sodium/potassium sur calcium/ magnsium lev (suprieur  5). Par contre dans le rgime fille ce mme rapport doit tre infrieur  2,8. "En effet, explique le Docteur Fran?ois Papa, lalimentation de la maman influence dans les voies gnitales le tri des spermatozo?des, porteur soit du chromosome X soit du chromosome Y".     Le rgime fille repose sur une alimentation riche en calcium, en magnsium et pauvre en sodium et en potassium. Concrtement il faut boire beaucoup de lait et manger des yaourts, du beurre, des fromages type emmenthal, gruyre, chvre frais, comt, des fruits secs (amandes, cacahoutes, noisettes etc.)  condition quils ne soient pas sals et du chocolat. Il est prfrable dopter pour du pain ou des biscottes sans sel. Enfin, il faut sinterdire la charcuterie, les viandes et les poissons sals, les crustacs et viter de toucher  la salire. Le rgime gar?on,  l'inverse, est bas sur une alimentation sale vitant les laitages. Il faut donc privilgier la viande et les poissons, le pain, les fruits et bannir le lait, le fromage et les patisseries.    L'autre mthode, base sur le principe que les spermatozoides qui dterminent le sexe de l' enfant ont des proprits diffrentes suivant leur catgorie.     Les spermatozoides "males" sont vloces et ont une dure de vie courte ; les spermatozoides "femelles" ont un dplacement plus lent mais une dure de vie plus longue.     Partant de ce principe, on comprend qu'un rapport bien avant la date d'ovulation aura plus de chance d'engendrer une fille ; un rapport trs proche de l'ovulation aura plus de chance d'engendrer un gar?on. Reste  conna?tre la date d'ovulation, qui ne peut se prvoir que chez les femmes aux cycles trs rguliers !    http://www.bebe-zone.com/methodes.html    http://www.aufeminin.com/maternite/fille...    http://www.aufeminin.com/maternite/fille...    http://filleougarcon.infobebes.com/htm/a...    http://www.sonath.com/accueil.htm    http://filleougarcon.infobebes.com/htm/a...    http://www.aquadesign.be/news/article-23...    http://www.aquadesign.be/news/article-23...

Q0DqzjiSaa	le repos ne va, pour moi, rien changer! Quel travail fais-tu?  Pour la petite histoire, enceinte de 5 semaines, j'ai fait un dbut de fausse couche. Dcollement d'un tiers de la surface de l'oeuf. Repos absolu, plus de travail, plus de voiture.  Pourtant, en sortant des urgences, je suis retourne au travail. Il est vrai que je suis comptable. Donc, j'ai prvenu mes collgues que je ne porterais plus d'normes caisses de dossiers. Par contre, ayant une voiture rcente et donc confortable, j'ai continu la route (j'ai fait plus de 200 km chaque jour de ma grossesse). Ma fille se porte  merveille.  Une amie avait t pour sa premire cho et le gynco lui a dit que c'tait un oeuf clair. Rendez vous tait donc pris pour un curetage. Heureusement, ils ont fait une cho juste avant car ils ont entendu un coeur battre. L aussi, une superbe petite puce est ne.  Si le sac n'est pas embryonnaire, tu ne peux rien faire d'autre que d'attendre.  Si il y a un embryon dedans, tu ne sais rien faire non plus pour assurer une suite  100% favorable, comme pour toutes les grossesses...  Les pertes de sang doivent malheureusement t'alerter!  Pour le repos, je te conseille, suivant la nature de ton boulot bien s?r, de ne plus rien faire une fois rentre chez toi. Reste allonge et dort un maximum!  Je croise les doigts pour toi!|`|pH2iBjzbaa	il faut te reposer ma chere et surtout soit forte et on croise les doigts pour toi|`|da3c1a3e6e6a6ffd29819b3832af687eaa	La perte de sang n'augure rien de bon. Repose-toi! Tu peux trs bien travailler et par contre pas de sport et repos  la maison. Je croise les doigts pour toi!|`|fcee758be0715f930722b7d7502651f4aa	je suis alle voir la question precedente pour essay de comprendre. Mais finalement je n'ai pas l'indication que je cherchais puisque  priorit l'amenhorre pas t trs franche. D'aprs toi tu serais enceinte de combien de temps? J'ai envie de dire que : perte de sang + sac vide ne font pas forcement penser  une grossesse volutive. En mme temps si je me rfre  ma propre histoire: rien n'est simple. En fait quand j'ai fait la prise de sang, le taux de HCG ne correspondait pas au terme et tait super bas. J'ai fait une premire cho: l'interne a trouv un sac vide. Cependant mon taux de HCG continuait mystrieusement  volu..c'est le chef de clinique qui intrigu a pris le relais 6 heures aprs l'interne et s'est exclam: "mais il est l! et on le voit l'embryon!"...en fait le premier sac tait vide mais cachait ma fille. Je pense que d'ici la prochaine cho tu as des PDS  faire? c'est une bonne indication..si le taux de HCG continue  augmenter de manire significative, il se peut que ta grossesse soit plus recente que prvue.  Je te souhaite de tout coeur d'tre enceinte..mais si ce n'est pas le cas, sache que je suis passe il y a quelques annes par l'oeuf clair et que cela ne m'a pas empch de devenir maman par la suite...donne nous des nouvelles.|`|ca743b092160fe64a34ff23c754d4c17aa	et cest une fille ou un garcon ?|`|1bb8f8fd10c4fec208e8718bd0e9b462aa	ne stress pas repose toi au maximun c'est peut etre juste que l'echo a etait fait trop tot pour voir un embryon dans le sac|`|UA5Hc6xyaa	prend patience et ne te stresse pas; tu verras le jour de l'chographie...|`|1Zxvj6KBaa	ne stress pas ! il faut relativiser, c'est tres difficile, je me doute, mais si il ne tient pas, ce n'est pas de ta faute ! et puis il y a 1 chance sur 2, il sera peut etre positif, c'est tout le mal que je te souhaite ! en tout cas, tiens nous inform, et ne perd pas espoir !|`|19c9a655639ba01878790a88ac540e36aa	tu ne peux rien faire!  il faut attendre, soit le sac est vide et partira de lui-mme, soit on ne voit encore rien mais un petit va se dvelopper!  les pertes sont frquentes au dbut, certaines ont mme des rgles.  te reposer ne signifie pas arrter de travailler sauf si c'est un travail trs physique,  ce stade, tu ne risques rien, si tu le perds c'est que le sac tait vide c'est tout.|`|BNExLmZzaa	Je ne sais pas trop quoi te rpondre,  part que je te souhaite de tout coeur que cela volu dans le positif.  Mais mme si tu bosses, reposes toi ds que tu le peux et surtout vites le stress ou l'angoisse.     Tiens nous au courant de tout ?a et ne perds pas espoir.    A + ;-)    * Pouce en bas, ?a j'aimerais bien qu'on m'explique. Un peu de courage. *|`|HD0S4Vtnaa	Si il s'agit d'un sac non embryonn, malheureusement il n'y a peu de chance qu'il se dveloppe c'est ce que l'on appelle un oeuf clair. Par contre si il y un embryon, il faut voir si il se dveloppe correctement.    En tout cas, patiente, mais si tu as un peu de sang n'hsite pas  consutler de nouveau et vant ton prochain RDV sinon va aux urgences.    BON COURAGE, tient nous au courant|`|89ec524a453c8ebba144c7b7c540366daa	Gnralement les pertes de sang c'est pas top mais si c'est lger c'est pas grave cela arrive et puis si tu as eu un examen vaginal ds les 2-3 derniers jours cela pourrais expliquer la perte de sang.  si tu veux savoir si elle evolue bien tu peux aussi faire un 2ieme test sanguin 48 h au moins apres la premire prise de sang et sui cela a plus que doubl c'est que a priori c'est tout bon !!   mais repose toi en effet bosse mais des que t u peux repose toi pas trop sport et dors tot !!!  on croise les doigts pour toi et tiens nous au courant !|`|8XGW6PKOaa	Coucou, oui un sac non embryonn s'appelle un oeuf clair donc normalement tu le perdras comme une fausse-couche, sous forme de pertes de sang, j'en ai eu un il y a 5 ans...Mais mme si ?a n'est pas agrable et que tu es presse d'tre enceinte, ne dramatises pas trop dans la mesure o de toutes fa?ons il n'y a pas de bb...  Par contre si l'chographie a t faite trop t?t pour voir l'embryon et qu'il y est quand mme, alors c'est autre chose mais vu que tu perds un peu de sang, ?a ressemble quand mme plut?t  un dbut de fausse-couche, as-tu des douleurs dans le bas du ventre?  Bon courage en tous cas

6GKLuoI0aa	It's possible but I would go see a doctor, These aren't regular signs of pregnancy. It could be a completely seporate issue|`|3oJL2Go3aa	These arent really signs of early pregnancy but you could be pregnant. A friend of mine got pregnant using the pull out method. It doesnt always work.. So I would go see a doctor. Because if your not pregnant there could be something wrong with your body..|`|zT8pTaIgaa	Yes, you cold be pregnant. (Though in my non-expert opinion I don't think it's too horribly likely.)  Just be calm and wait a couple weeks and a pregnancy test will tell you.  Stressing about it now won't make anything better, so long as you know what you're going to do about it if you do turn out to be.    Thanks for including way more relevant information than these questions usually do!  You obviously know a lot about fertility and birth control . . . I strongly encourage you to get ahold of some more reliable birth control and take charge of your body!  Good luck and power to you.
4V8Sp69uaa	not likely! |`|01vMpHkWaa	lmao lmao lmao lmao stupid stupid question      NOOO she cant    she shouldnt of even taken the morning after pill    lmfao|`|3oJL2Go3aa	No! Sperm can only survive for a hour outside of the body. Also you have to have some penetration to get pregnant and if there was none then no she cant be pregnant. I wouldnt worry about it. It is really unlikely to happen..|`|5UoLngxfaa	most likely not don't worry but to be safe take a test if she misses her period good luck and stop having any kind of sex |`|JjbBacdFaa	Oh give me strength.     No she can't. Grow up.|`|8aXDhia7aa	Many people try for years, having unprotected sex at exactly the right time each month (trust me its a small window) and still have trouble getting pregnant.  The fact that you and your girlfriend didn't even have sex and then she also took a morning after pill...well all I can say is it would be a bloody miracle!  And don't stand next to someone, or even look at someone, who is trying NOT to get pregnant.|`|9ev0bBoeaa	I bet she is.|`|WyNnpctcaa	Even though it seems easy to get pregnant, it's really not THAT easy. Most couples who actually want and try to have a baby don't conceive for about a year. And many people have unprotected sex without getting pregnant. So don't worry about it. Chances of that are really really slim. However, always be careful! 
2NxBl4t9aa	My doctor said between 37 weeks and 40 weeks! The doctor will determine when you need to be done based on your cervix and babies size at the last ultra sound you have! I'm being told i have a chance of a c-section to but because of having a big baby! I go in next week to see how big baby is at 36 weeks and 3 days! I can say that at 32 weeks he measured 5 lbs 5 oz which is large for that gestation! My doctor said I have a high chance of a C-section becasue she doesn't want to risk the baby getting stuck! She will be scheduling my section next week after the ultra sound if she determines that the baby is to large! Which will make me between 37 weeks and 38 weeks for when I go in! Trust your doctor because since you have a placenta issue they wont let you get to the point that labor could start on its own! Good luck! |`|3oJL2Go3aa	I do know they tell you that it is safe to have your baby betwen 37 and 40 weeks. Your doctor might make you wait until you are 40 weeks depending on how you are doing.  My sister in law had to go in for a emergency caesarean because her hips wouldnt spread during delivery. But im not sure on a scheduled one. I would think between 37 and 40 weeks. |`|CdodhnP5aa	Im having a pre-booked c-section and my dr said they want to do it a week prior to my due date.|`|9ev0bBoeaa	I think unless the baby or yourself is in danger they want you to wait until the 37 to 40 week period.

MUEsS8tYaa	My hubby and I had been having sex for two years, without any birth control, timing it all right, and still couldn't get pregnant. we were thinking that it was going to be impossible for us. Well, I am now 27 weeks along, with a baby boy!!! He was quite the surprise, because we never thought it would happen for us. :) Congratulations to you, and I'll pray that everything goes well throughout your pregnancy!|`|o4OZalbSaa	I was told I wouldn't be able to have children because of my pcos being so bad.  Then in 2005, after not having a period for something like 7 months, I found out I was pregnant.  I had my little boy in April of 2006, and after having him my periods went back to pretty much being normal, and I'm pregnant with number 2. I agree, miracles happen. :)|`|ACc1skbPaa	My third child I had such a heavy "period" and felt so NOT pregnant that I didn't believe it until he kicked me some 15 weeks in!!   Congratulations and Good Luck--I'll be thinking of you!|`|KHZLPldraa	O0o0oh Congratulations!!  I went through 4 years of fertility treatments for my now 17 month old, (PCOS and blocked tube) so we weren't using any protection because my ob said I would need treatments again to conceive another.  Well she was wrong I am due in June with Baby #3!<br>  <br>  Congratulations to you!  And yes God is Good, and what a Miracle baby you and your husband will have!|`|0viZhxi6aa	My son was such a surprise, because I thought I couldn't have any more children. I though if you don't have periods, you don't ovulate, therefore making conception impossible. Guess not! My last period was April 2007 and DJ was born June 27, 2008. My problem, though, was not finding out until way late in my pregnancy that I was even pregnant. There was no period to miss, and I never got sick, and didn't even feel movement until 30 weeks. (He was upside down and backwards, so when he moved, it just made me have to pee more, which I attributed to ice tea.) I even took a test in Feb. 2008 but it came back negative, which my doctor later told me was because they can stop working when the hgc levels are too high. I should have shelled out the money for a blood test. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't pregnant due to the no period thing, and thought I wasn't. oops! But he's doing fine now, despite being born early and all that, so oh well. God just wanted to surprise us. Good luck to you, I hope all goes well and you have a beautiful baby!|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	I got pregnant in Sept of 2004.  I certainly wasn't trying (I was single), but I had been told that I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and that it would be extremely hard if not impossible for me to ever have children.  Because of not realizing I had morning sickness, not expecting to get a period, not gaining weight, etc., I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was 24.4 weeks along.  My healthy daughter was borning June 27, 2005.  She'll be 4 this year and is such a blessing to me.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i had unprotected sex for three years before i got pregnant, i thought i was infertile.....i was wrong!!!|`|yXGlmUqlaa	congratulations.<br>  <br>  never give up|`|zBz10IiOaa	well i am one it took me and my hubby 4 and a half years i never thought it would happen ,but i just quit stressing over it and never went to a dr or anything and finally i had my first one in feb 08 and the next one he is due in june!

AA11612508	dilute some juice, half water half juice. try that. maybe he just doesnt want plain water, and if its not appealing then why drink it, ya know.<br>  <br>  What i did starting at 6 months is juice in a sippy, and that was the only way to get juice. formula was for bottles, then round 12 months to switch to all sippy, even formula is easier. THey see the sippy as different sweet drink. just every meal he eat, give him sippy, only do milk for naps etc...<br>  <br>  just make him. honestly. thats how you get stuff done with babies. ie pacifiers, bottles at night, and sippy cups|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	With my son, I would just put a sippy cup with water in it in front of him at every meal, and I would leave one out within his reach during the day. It took a while, but eventually he got that he was supposed to pick the cup up and drink out of it. Just give him time and show him how to use it and he will get the hang of it.|`|eeGN977eaa	I would stick with just water or maybe juice in the cup but no formula. As far as the transition, it sounds like you are doing good. <br>  <br>  But please let me warn you Do Not Replace the Bottles with Sippy Cups! Sippy cups are harder to get rid of than bottles. (at least they were with my girls) I know this from experience. Try not let him have it with him at all times. Maybe keep one in the fridge for when he is thirsty and give him one with meals. This will help when it comes time to potty train too.|`|AA11835015	we skipped the sipping cup business. we tried but it was too messy. we let our boy drink water from the bottle as he wanted to until he had the skills to master a regular glass. maybe age three is too late for the "book", but why add stress over nothing to a child's early life?<br>  <br>  and thank you for naming him jacob and not "trawler" or "tugboat"|`|4IwTGwpyaa	Cute baby! . I just pour water in a cup and my son wants it so I hold it and he sips it. "eeeeehhhhhhh ! " That what he says when he wants to sip. Your kid will learn.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Put his favorite stuff ONLY in a sippy cup and see how fast he can do it himself!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	We just substituted the first bottle of the day with the cup (Nuby also).  Our intent was to gradually do this throughout the day, ending w/ the nighttime bottle.  He ended up taking right to the cup though and was on it/ off the bottle within a day or 2.  My oldest was a different story, it took forever to get him off of the nighttime bottle!!<br>  <br>  We did the transition from formula to milk at the same time, milk only in the cup and formula only in the bottle.  I think the fact that my son preferred the milk over the formula helped a lot.|`|lGSUToFQaa	well mine is exactly 1 month behind yours, i have been giving him a sippy cup, (gerber) since he was 5 months old, i have all the stoppers in place so it doesn't' leak, and i've been filling it with water, a little more over time, and showing him how to hold it, and practicing with him etc, and he's pretty good with it now, he doesn't take it to his mouth on his own but he can hold it with out spilling it, but i bought a few years ago these 5oz little cups, just because my daughter was planting flowers and they were cheaper and cuter than small flower pots, any way i had like 6 left over, and if you hold it he will try to hold it too but he can drink out of it, he pulls back when he's had enough or wants to play with it, so good luck, i hope i helped.
ObngW3xxaa	That's crazy cause my boyfriends brother just had a baby as well and I'm not due till August 19th! My b'fs b-day. But I kinda feel like time is going by slow and I'm really excited and anxious for the baby to get here. Seeing them just makes me a little envious of what they have even though I know I will soon have my baby here. I guess all we can do is wait patiently and enjoy been pregnant!|`|4kX61Y97aa	buy some clothes thats what made it real also having the scan at 12 weeks, start planning on what to buy and stuff it really does help soon you will feel baby kick now that will defently make it feel real <br>  <br>  <br>  all the best and congrats<br>  =] x|`|wl7tlYOYaa	go baby shopping that always help and lets you imagine a little baby in there and makes it more realam due august 23 lol mines is further  but for me is going very quickly|`|K5TrkUhCaa	You can start buying some baby things now and decorating the nursery (if you have one) and that might make things more real for you. You could also get some maternity shirts with cute little sayings on them like 'baby on board' and things like that. In just a few more weeks you will most likely be getting your big ultrasound done so that should help you feel more pregnant too. Just think, in 4 more weeks you will already be halfway through your pregnancy! Congrats to you!|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	As soon as you start feeling your baby "kicking", it will seem real enough!  <br>  <br>  Just talk to your baby, and enjoy every moment you have your baby in you.   Every moment is precious during pregnancy.     I would have been due around the same time with my second, but I miscarried early.   Just please enjoy your baby, inside and outside.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	my due date is august 15th :D<br>  buy some baby clothes, just whites and creams, start looking at push chars, cots, organising the baby's room, but dont do to much because in the last weeks you will be bored as hell|`|Bg6txvxqaa	To be honest, I'm 22 weeks now with twins and only over the last weeks or so had it seemed more real to me. Everyone is saying how small I still look, though I feel like I look as big as a house!<br>  <br>  My bump only started to show about 2 weeks ago, maybe a bit earlier, but even then people said I still looked pretty small.<br>  <br>  Believe me, time seems to drag by, but sometimes I just think about when I found out I was pregnant and it seems like ages ago! Time has just flown by!<br>  <br>  As you get further along in your pregnancy, you will feel liek the days drag, but all of a sudden a week will have gone by and you'll be wondering where the time went!<br>  <br>  I remember counting down the hours almost, until I was 13 weeks and in the clear!<br>  <br>  We bought baby stuff and that still didn't really seem to make it sink in much.<br>  <br>  What I would suggest is thiking of baby names, and rthiking about how much you have left until your due date. Just think about this, another month and you will be half way!<br>  <br>  Things start to get a little scarier then and you want more time to get used to it!<br>  <br>  When baby starts kicking hard, now that will help things sink in! It's a wonderful feeling and one you have to yourself for a good few weeks before anyone can feel or see it!|`|pjgMW6qaaa	Aww <br>  In a couple of weeks you will be showing and then you will probably be annoyed of people looking and trying to touch your belly haha (I wasn't)<br>  <br>  Its normal that you feel like that but when you feel movement it will feel "real" and even more when you find out the gender.<br>  <br>  Congrats.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	the brothers pregnancy seemed to go by fast for you but i bet any money it didnt for them..<br>  start shopping for things you need, start setting up the babies room etc.. soon enough its going to feel like a very real pregnancy and you are going to be miserable. lol Enjoy the break while you have it...|`|MUEsS8tYaa	Buy a few neutral baby clothes and toys. Thats what I did, and it helped. It will feel more and more real the further along you get. I'm 27 weeks along, and sometimes its still hard to wrap my mind around the thought that I'll be having a baby soon. Even thought I can already feel, and see him moving. Its an amazing thing though, good luck to you!|`|NNwEuC8paa	No not really, wear tighter cloths, and just enjoy it soon you will be huge and miserable, everyone feels like that lol... I can see why you would feel like this, i would too but your bundle of joy will be here before you know it!!!! Good luck hunny|`|UFu0h8SKaa	i don't think there is, just wait a few more wks and you'll be fat before you know it! You don't want to be fat too soon cos as it is you'll feel like you've been fat  long enough especially if we have a hot summer|`|K6rZmVmAaa	Have you decorated the nursery yet? I'm waiting to move to a 3 bed and my moving date been delayed so I feel fed up. I want to decorate!|`|ac4kIyYDaa	start buying some baby clothes even though you don't know the sex buy some of both all the winter clothes are on sale..|`|ACc1skbPaa	Spend time with your friends new baby, buy some baby items, read books and websites about pregnancy and sit back and daydream a bit--believe it or not, by the end of your pregnancy you will be waiting for the day you aren't pregnant anymore and just be wanting to hold the baby without strangers asking if they can touch your belly, Baby kicks to the ribs, peeing non-stop, heartburn, etc...trust me--it will seem real very very soon and for what will seem like forever!  But, like everything, before you know it the baby will be here and you won't be able to believe that it went so fast! Good Luck!!|`|ZLu6J2nVaa	hi im 21 weeks and i feel the same although i have a 6 year old boy already the whole thing seems so unreal going to my 5 month scan made the situation feel more real and also im feeling the baby kick now<br>  Is anyone else pregnant with their second child and feeling this way.
b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	prostitues sleep with men for money. i dont know who is more disgusting the man or the whore. She probably doent care about the baby she probably got knocked up while working and she looks at it as another mouth to feed. Ewwwww trifeling.|`|LQKW39SEaa	any body that has sex with a prostitute can't be that well anyway<br>  SAVE YOURSELF THE STDs<br>  AND PLAY WITH YOURSELF OR GET SOME FREAKING DOLLS|`|oWAUb6vpaa	They're both disgusting.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? That's awful.|`|kzyEuRroaa	I know there are men out there that find pregnant women beautiful and sexy.  More disgusting though- the woman who is pregnant and letting men use her like that.

But, sex does not hurt baby. Then again, diseases will hurt baby. But if this person is a prostitute, then she probably already has diseases!<br>  I blame the man for having sex with the prostitute, not just because she is pregnant because my hubby can't keep his hands off me now that I am pregnant lol! But that is the way to do it, not with a prostitute!<br>  <br>  What is with the thumbs down??? Why would it be ok? Whoever thumbs downed me is really sick!|`|AA11612508	yuck. i guess some guys find it sexual. and with the mother that is her job, just like us, without judgement here, she has to work. Its not like she can take 9 months off. or get maternity leave.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	I don't think most prostitutes are selling their bodies for fun and enjoyment.  I suspect if she had other options, she wouldn't be doing it any time, never mind at this point.  Or maybe she's trying to bring on labor!|`|IVNM1O5naa	That is really sick... This question is rather disturbing.
5eSSAT69aa	Listen up Tay Tay...My name is not, I repeat not permitted for just anyone to use. My momma created Slutina when she looked at the way I nursed from anyone with boobies and simply knew in her heart what my true name should be. Slappy: your babby girl should feel as honored as I do to have a pretty name such as Sluttie. She will be very popular in her teen years with the boys.|`|p1gzHgAraa	well in america she would catch ALOT of crap as a child.. i would pick another name-its just not really appropriate in this day and age-maybe a few hundred years ago it would be a pretty name.|`|1tiCB311aa	Is there a way you can rewrite the name like Sloottie and it still mean the same. I don't think leaving it that way will fly good in the USA|`|1WS0ojj5aa	Im sorry, but if you live somewhere where english is spoken everyone will think its sluty, even if it means something else in your culture.|`|DhmjLRoUaa	No<br>  <br>  Slutina<br>  And nickname her Sluttie|`|xCfHnQBbaa	Please don't do that to her!

oXIYHsDaaa	The nutritional content of breast milk changes as your baby gets older, because the milk is going to be used for newborns in the NICU your child has to be young enough that the milk contains all of the compounds in the right proportions to benefit such young babies. You should still be able to donate to a milk bank that caters to families with older babies or give it to someone who has an older baby privately through www.milkshare.com<br>  <br>  If a woman gets pregnant again and is tandem nursing the milk returns to the newborn state. (That's why some toddlers quit nursing when mom's pregnant - not all but some) It is not at all harm full for the older child to have the more concentrated higher fat milk, but if a younger baby gets the less concentrated lower fat milk that a 12 month old gets it's not enough for them. It would be kind of like watering down formula and giving it to a new born, they wouldn't thrive because they wouldn't be getting enough nutrients and fat.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	beacuse after 6 months your breastmilk matures to suit a baby 6m+ and is therefore not suited to a newborn.<br>  <br>  re: getting pregnant again - my friend has a 9m old and is pregnant again, she has researched a lot about breastfeeding during pregnancy & has been told that once you are 4 months pregnant your milk becomes colostrum once again - babies can still obviously breastfeed but usually by the time a woman is pregnant again they have started on some other foods & fluids - at least in *most* cases I should imagine they have.<br>  <br>  Good on you for thinking of it though, my friend donated to a lady who was having chemo & couldn't breastfeed - I thought she was awsome, looking after a newborn & pumping for someone else must have been a mission!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	That is great, the first woman that answered clearly has no idea as to which is more beneficial or how it benefits neo-natal children.<br>  <br>  The milk produced in the first six months has the most nutritional value. Why? I am not sure.|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	Probably it is the best time when the milk you produce is perfect and is suitable for storage purpose and to be fit for a new born|`|08GDBedGaa	probably because the first few months your milk is different, more suitable for younger/premature babies, apparently the milk changes like the baby does, by 9 months something happens too, cant quite remember!!|`|723QHuicaa	Because after 6m old, the milk might be unsuitable for newborns.<br>  <br>  ''Once the milk donations have been screened and pasteurised, they are refrozen and stored in huge freezers, ready for use. <br>  <br>  The donations can be kept for up to six months and mums can only donate when their baby is under six months old – after that, their milk may be unsuitable for newborn babies.''<br>  <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/life-style/kids-and-family/2009/01/07/could-you-donate-breast-milk-to-another-woman-s-baby-115875-21021455/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mirror.co.uk/life-style/kids-...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  **** I expect with tandem nursing, the milk will ''renew'', as in you will produce colostrum again, then go from there, so your ''new'' milk will be less than 6m old.
af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	Be straight forward with him and tell him yes or no. if no then you can't really do much about it except DONT GET PREGNANT. ask him wh is he changing his mind so much. I don't know about your relationship but if you guys are living together have good jobs and all that i'd say why not!? but if that's not the case you both should get your life together and prepare as much as you can for a baby because its hard when you don't get that full support from your guy. Good luck though the best you can do is talk it with him the pros and cons about having a baby depending on what he says you should pretty much know why he goes back and forth on it and if it's the right decision for you both. but if he is going back and forth on it i'd say then don't get pregnant but if it happens it happens good luck hunny|`|UNWLaJbKaa	Please don't take this the wrong way,  but making that kind of commitment to someone for life when he's not ready may not be the right thing to do.  Enjoy yourselves, and your relationship because once you bring a baby into the mix a lot of things change for both of you.  time, privacy, sleep, sex.  <br>  <br>  I have seen so many of my friends have baby's with their boyfriends who ended up raising them on their own because it just wasn't fun for him any more.  <br>  <br>  When it's the right moment you will know, and he will know, and it will just happen naturally.  There won't be any tug of war between yes or no.<br>  <br>  Be patient, and continue enjoying your relationship in the mean time, and if it's meant to be.. it will be.<br>  <br>  Anything forced in life.. is never a good thing.|`|yea2hci5aa	If I were you I would wait.  He's obviously having second thoughts and the last thing you want is to raise a baby on your own.  He may just be saying he wants a baby because he knows how much you want one.  I think the best thing for you to do is wait 6 months to a year and then sit down with him and explain to him why you want a baby and tell him you want to know what he thinks, that you want an honest response.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	Tell her that you two are not at all adolescent and amateur <br>  So it should be either yes or no for once <br>  This is a major part and decision of your life and you too should not play like this on having an issue<br>  I would rather say that you are the one who is giving him Spacle to let him say yes or no<br>  <br>  Take care and time and discuss this rather than asking in the forums <br>  You too need to sit and talk|`|Od73sfkxaa	I would sit down and talk to him about his indecisiveness. I read this article about how most men don't want to settle down or get married until they can financially afford a home and really provide for a family. Now, applying that theory/idea to this...it could be the same thing. He may feel intimidated at the idea of being a father, and most men (even though a lot of women work nowadays) still feel like they need to be the bread winner. <br>  <br>  When we decided to get pregnant...we researched, and LOTS of it. In planning to get pregnant, go through your bills, find a cheaper grocery store (Sam's Club/BJ's), start looking into the price of baby furniture, do you qualify for Medicaid(?) or what is your current health insurance like(?), hospital birth vs. home birth, daycare or will one of you need to stay home? There is a lot to consider, but he may be more comfortable once you start planning. I know my husband was. At first he was iffy -- and then once I researched and learned more, he grew to the idea. He now wants to become a dad.<br>  <br>  So I would sit down and talk to him. Start making a list of things you need to research. You could research together or show him your results when you are finished.<br>  I wish you the best of luck and try to be patient with him. Us women tend to mature and be ready for families faster than men.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	U wait. He obviously isnt ready. Dont' get pregnant and expect him to stick around.
fecUjSr1aa	I'll be honest with you, I never had that problem with my kids when they were growing up. I had 2 boys and when they were misbehaving,  all I had to do was "pssssssssssst," and a stern look, and it would make them toe the line .. seriously<br>  <br>  you have a special child, very sensitive case and, one i must admit have no experience dealing with. all i can say is that you got to have a very big heart, a huge depository of patience and a knack for expecting the unexpected. <br>  <br>  also, when times get hard, don't consider it a curse but a blessing and think about the good things you could enjoy even if your daughter has a handicap.  think about the parents who raised normal kids but whose kids are now wanted by the law or languishing in prison.<br>  <br>  a whole lotta optimism would be your key. I feel you and hope it works out good for you.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Remember when she was two and went through the 'terrible twos?" She was probably very sweet most of the time but would occasionally throw a tantrum? When she was two, you probably picked her up and put her in time out or ignored her until she was through with her fit.<br>  <br>  Well, now she is 12 and is doing the same thing. The preteen years (age 10-13 or so) is a LOT like the toddler years except they are a lot bigger. Her body is going through all sorts of changes, many of which she does not understand. She wants to be 'independent' yet coddled at the same time. Occasionally, she just needs to vent.<br>  <br>  Tell her to go to her room (time out) and scream into her pillow. Do not let her throw things or slam doors. (I told my kids that if they slammed the door, I would remove the door from its hinges, then they would get no privacy. I did this once and they got the idea that I was serious) Stay as calm as you can while she is throwing her temper tantrum. <br>  <br>  When she is done, calmly ask her what was wrong and LISTEN to her. She may not be able to come up with a good reason why she was angry or it may not seem like a good reason to you, but it was important to HER.<br>  <br>  Good luck and remember, this is only a stage and will not last forever (it just may seem that way!)|`|OuuYoSBeaa	id woop her butt. put a stop to her scream before she gets a chance to carry it on. throw her in her room with nothing in it for her to break or play with or occupy her time. a bed and dresser is about all that she should have...keep it that way, and on good behaviour she can have one item back at a time, but if she defies again, then away it comes....<br>  im wondering if maybe seeing a councellor at school with help aswell.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	put her across your knee and spank her bare bottom|`|8e6c383126356904be5b927eeaa2d08caa	i would recommend, listen to the kid calmly, <br>  <br>  do u get the message in the enraged daughter? <br>  <br>  everything matters, ur day to day behaviour, ur time for family, and ur care and consideration for the kids and how much u sacrifice for ur kids.<br>  <br>  imp: dont lock her up till she calms down,, you will have negative effects as her anger will be permanently engraved in her mind, u need to have her speak and u listen for the her to vent out everything.<br>  <br>  helps the childs mental health too.<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  friends forever,, <br>  btw i have a 15 month old|`|40a1a9a018b700c159b91d322ba86796aa	My daughter is almost 20 and never yelled at me.  I'd suggest telling her to stop using that tone of voice - you won't stand for it.  YOU are the parent and she should treat you with respect.  If she is upset, I'd tell her to go to her room until she can calm down. Then, she can come and talk with you about it calmly and you will listen.

Find out what triggers this behavior and see if you can get her some help. It sounds like she doesn't know how to deal with her emotions, and she'll need some help with that before she gets older and is stuck in her ways.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I don't know how long this has been going on. If this has just started you need to let her know that this kind of behavior is not acceptable. Then punish or discipline as you normally would. If this has been going on for a while it will be harder to reel it in. When your both calmed down, removed from the situation you need to teach her constructive ways to deal with anger. There are many different technics so do your research and pick the ones that fit you best. I have a 7 year old girl and a 16 year old boy. Both have tested this approach at different times. I have a policy that I address any behavioral issues right then. I normally don't have to scream yell or punish. I talk they listen and if they don't change I punish using different things depending on whats going on in their life and what I think will make the largest impact at that time.

0vpDDM8aaa	my husband was in despair for a day or two. lol  we were also sure we were having a boy.  but once it set in...he got very excited.  and now Josie has him wrapped around her finger...!  i am now pregnant with baby #2 and he is worried that it might be a boy this time...because now that hes had a girl, he doesnt know how he will handle a boy!  lol  no matter what you have, your husband will quickly adjust...especially once they see that little face.|`|xCifmFfkaa	Once the baby is born, it should come naturally to him, regardless of the sex of the baby.<br>  <br>  Tell him to take it easy. When the baby comes, he'll know what to do, and even then he'll have some time before the baby is a real 'girly girl'... he has time.<br>  <br>  Remind him also, that a little girl's relationship with her daddy is one of the most important she'll have throughout her lifetime. Remind him this, and remind him that he can't drop the ball on his first-born...|`|nJqVAXZ9aa	Hey you two stop there and don't predict and be nervous <br>  After the baby is born you wont be able to separate yourself from her from a minute<br>  You will have a feeling that she is your part part of your life and you brought her in this world<br>  <br>  So just enjoy your time things will be wonderful at the end <br>  As you will think so you will get <br>  <br>  Enjoy!!!|`|6ppi5jeAaa	raising to the teens is the same then things change a little. he was probably looking forward to father/son activities e.g. football and baseball. he will just have to switch to soccer and softball. i was the first child and a girl and beside my father i learned to fish, change tires and fix cars (saves on mechanic bills). there is no limit on what he can teach his child whether it be a son or daughter. and daughters can be as tough as sons..i have one of each.|`|cypZ0ykXaa	i'm 26 weeks with a girl. and my hubby is so excited at the same time he started extra savings & buying properties to secure the lil girls life.|`|gCBqdHf2aa	I won't find out what I am having for another two weeks. But my husband doesn't want a girl, he thinks the way the world is right now, all little girls are sluts, expecially after watching the movie Towelheads. I am nervous about having a little girl, but I am sure he will get over it, once she is here.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	My husband wanted a boy. As a matter of fact he was sure it was a boy, I was sure it was a girl. So we went to the doctor and found out it was a girl. We both were excited but he told me that raising a girl would be harder for him and that boys are "easier" and he didn't want to have to deal with the issue of dating. I think it's normal for guys to want a little boy. But when that girl comes, she's going to have your husband wrapped around her little finger. I know my husband will be.|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	Yes, i had the same thing. I think men idealise having a son and what it would mean to them<br>  <br>  You will all be fine as soon as she comes along. He will fall madly in love with her and these nerves will be completely forgotten!<br>  <br>  If it helps, i felt the same as your husband when i thought i was having aboy! 'OMG, there's no boys in our family, i know nothing about raising boys!'<br>  <br>  Lol<br>  <br>  don't worry, you will be fine<br>  x|`|rdpZrBc9aa	My husband knew even less about babies than I did!  Our first was a girl, and she's had him wrapped around her finger from the day she was born.  I predict five minutes, tops, before he's in love!|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	Well my husband wanted a girl at first but it was a boy & now he still really wants a girl & well we dont know yet but i think he would be more nervous then he himself thinks
uJPVvqOEaa	I'm in about the exact same situation. My family lives 3 hours away in another state. I'm home alone from 5am when my husband leaves for work to about 7pm. My baby is 5 months old. I'm very wiped out as well. By the time my husband comes home he's too tired to help get her ready for bed so it's all me. Try and hang in there. I'm sure it'll get better once the baby gets a little older.|`|XvePaWWXaa	My husband works from home but he may as well not be here. He's never changed a diaper and doesn't interact with us during the day. Today was a rough day but I just had to get through it, I do the evenings alone too, it's like being a single mom. It's hard!|`|MXVrsn1Oaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I myself havent been thru it yet as only 37 weeks pregnant with first child. have you talked to your health visitor? They'l have a list of places where mums with young children meet up. have you tried baby massage groups? my friend goes and has made so many friends with babys the same age as hers. Im already signed up for when mine arrives. I know how horrible it is to be stuck at home alone all day. Hope this helps. Chin up :)|`|oXIYHsDaaa	You should look for a parent and tot program in your area, almost every community has at least one free program for parents to go to during the day with their babies and toddlers. It can be very isolating being a new mom and post partum depression can sneak up on you if you become completely isolated. I'm not sure where you live, but if you contact your local community services, YMCA or boys and girls club they should be able to point you in the right direction also google parenting in your area and you might find some programs that way. If you can't find a program to go to or can't get to the ones offered then start walking. If you walk to the park and even just sit on a bench near the playground and read a book while baby naps in the stroller you may run into other stay at home moms and start making friends. We all go through this as a first time mom so trust me there are other mom's in your area that need to meet you as much as you need to meet them,<br>  Good luck and congrats on the little one.. It gets easier I promise|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I didn't go through that when my daughter was that young, but I do now. It gets better. When we first moved away and got our house I couldn't believe how different it was from what I had imagined. You have to get out and do stuff with your baby!!! Otherwise you will go absolutely nuts. It does get better as they get older though. When mine was about 15 months she started playing by herself more and I got more "mom breaks." I completely understand not having family and friends nearby. It makes a huge difference when it comes to your day, doesn't it? I hope things start looking up for you!|`|YsnY9LqIaa	My husband works away and has done since our daughter (now 17 months) was born so mostly it's me, my daughter and the dog 24/7.  I sometimes have days when I realise I've spoken to no one but my daughter or the dog for 2 whole days!  I have no family locally either but have tried to make the effort to get out and meet people via baby groups etc.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Oh yes. My little boy is almost 4 months old and I stay home with him too while my husband works. I don't really mind the fact that it's just me with him, its more because I'm so bored. I love being home with him, but I feel like a prisoner some days being cooped up in here all day every day. You're not alone.|`|AA11612508	same situation but with older kids, 3 and 6 with baby on the way. That is how it is i think. You cant have both. if you did and daddy was home all day you would be broke. also that is what weekends are for, atleast for us.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I am, but mines a little worse! My fiance works away from home, so he's only here maybe one week a month if were lucky, so it's just me and my son ALL DAY, and daddy never comes home to help. I'm feeling very isolated because I'm sick, and i'm getting a little stir crazy, every once in a while my son and I just go to wal-mart, or out shopping and browsing, it does pass the time, and helps me feel not so cooped up. Also if it's jacket weather outside I always take him to the park, but you could probably take your son for a walk, but if it's cold maybe just go for a drive? We do that too and my son enjoys it. I think it will be better this summer because we can actually go out, I think everyone gets a little stir crazy during the winter, just hang in there only a few more months to go and you can go out of the house and just go outside, my son always enjoyed going out on the front porch in his walker last year, and that helped to get me at least outside for a while.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	I was the same way now my 3-4 month old is 2.5 and I'm 8 months pregnant and absolutly huge which makes it that much harder and it is very lonely but you can get out can't you? Go for a walk, go to the park and read find a way to meet other mommies that are looking for people to connect with. The fresh air will make you feel better and you may make some new friends that you can then spend time with.|`|7ZMmQhWraa	Troy is 8 weeks but he and i are usually one on one till 2 pm. it is great for bonding, bathing, tummy time, walking in the coach. Throw your laundry in the wash and go on a walk with the baby. Mommy and Me has playgroups and storytime you and your baby can get involved in. Check the website Mommyandme.com or your local library.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	My kids are a little older now, but I have been there! It is very exhausting. It does get a little better when the baby gets older and starts playing and interacting more! Maybe go to your local YMCA or something similar and sign up for a mommy and me class with your baby! It will be good for the baby, and wonderful for you to meet some mommies in your area!|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I did and still do with my 14 month old twins.  I am SAHM and it does get exhausting.  To stop me from going insane I go on regular walks with twins (in their pram of course).  Can you join a mother's group?.  I attended one last week and I found them quite good.   Just keep yourself busy.  You will be fine.|`|0IPxeDJiaa	I WAS in this situation.  It was too cold to go outside and my DH workded long hours too.  Basically you're a single mom that is well financed LOL (at least this is what it FEELS like)!  <br>  <br>  Seriously, go out to lunch with friends and your baby - your baby will love it!  Go to the mall, just get out!!  If you can find a baby group, it's time.  Where I lived this was not an option, but search, search, search.  And call up your friends and see if they want to even pop around on the weekend.  Sometimes those weekend visits got me through the week.  <br>  <br>  DD is now 13 months and it's much easier, so hang in there.  And try to get out with your DH from time to time if you can.  It will do you a world of GOOD!|`|39qec43kaa	I stay home with my two month old everyday all day while my husband works.  I have been there too, I sometimes get bored out of my mind not like I don't have a million things I could do but I feel kinda trapped in the house especially in this cold weather.  I try to do at least one thing for myself a day and it helps.  It may be just a shower or a tv show but it helps and at least tell yourself you at least did that.  Be positive and interact with your baby as much as possible and just enjoy being able to be at home for your baby.  I used to work in daycare so I try telling myself that many parents don't get to be as lucky as me to stay at home and raise my son.|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	No I am not in this situation.<br>  I am currently working part time and I go to school part time. <br>  I have been a mom for a decade and I have been a stay at home mom for four of those years. I never isolated myself from others - I don't think I would have made it four years if I did.<br>  <br>  You need to get out of your house and be around other people! You can visit a senior citizen center, go the storytime at the library, or go to your local park. You have alot of options for you and baby to get out of the house and be around other people.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Yes, almost exactly. All we do after my husband gets home is our dinner, her bedtime routine, and then I go to bed!  I do make him give her her bedtime bottle, but often she is fussy and I have to help with that, too!  I know he tries hard to help out, and its not his fault he can't be around more, but it can be very frustrating and wearing!<br>  <br>  Here is my number one piece of advice - do some internet research and see if your area has a mom's club, especially one for stay at home mom's. This has been a _lifesaver_ for me. All of a sudden I know a dozen people in the same boat as I am, with the same questions and problems.  It is a great support group.  And once a week we have playgroup - a chance to get out of the house to a baby friendly place, and even get some adult conversation!  And the members with older kids have been there too, and are super helpful with advice or even errands and meals when I am having a really bad day.    I really went from few friends locally to a bunch of friends, and ones who don't mind talking about spit-up and the merits of Gerber vs Beechnut rice cereal.<br>  <br>  Btw, for those long days, here is a website with some fun game ideas for baby. Our DD doesn't mind the same toys over and over again, but I start to!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/development/letsplay/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/develop...</a>
diT2WFfCaa	The weird butterfly feelings are probably caused by anxiety that she might be pregnant!  Cramps are often a symptom of PMS, and if you just had sex last week, chances are they aren't pregnancy cramps-they don't tend to show up that early.  <br>  <br>  If she doesn't have her period within a week, she should take a pregnancy test, and then head to the doctors to confirm the results.  Even if the test is negative, she should be speaking with her doctor about the reasons her period is late/missed.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	You'd have to wait another couple of weeks before you can test but I'm guessing it's just late.<br>  <br>  You were sensible to use protection, a lot of people on here don't even think about it!<br>  <br>  Wait another 2 weeks at least and get an early response test and if her period doesn't turn up next week, take another test to make sure.<br>  <br>  It is still possible to get pregnant whilst using contraception of any kind, but it is much better to use it than to just take the chance!<br>  <br>  EDIT - as the person above just said, get her to try a pill or some other kind of protection so put both of your minds at rest in future. Be sure to still use a condom though as I got pregnant on the pill and now I'm expecting twins! It's not worth the risk for a bit of fun if your too young or not ready for the responsibility.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	If those were the first times you had sex, it would be way too soon to know if she's pregnant.  If you've had sex before, she might be and she should take a test.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	according to the times you've had sex and when she was expecting her period, she would not show any signs yet.<br>  <br>  IF she was pregnant from those days she would still get her period on the 21st. it would still be too early to miss one.<br>  <br>  she's probably stressing out which can cause a period to be late<br>  <br>  also if you are that worried maybe your gf should go on the pill + still use condoms for extra protection.<br>  BUT no protection is 100% effective.|`|ac4kIyYDaa	she wouldn't be able to experience symptoms that soon it takes about 2 weeks for the baby to start forming unless she had unprotected sex before this approx a month or so ago, or its because she is young and she is still having an irregular period. Mine was irregular my whole life..|`|0dHVapEZaa	Dude, the best and 'quiet' way to be sure is to go to your local pharmacy and buy a pregnancy test for your girlfriend, its not so expensive and you'll get confirmation on the status of your GF. the sooner the better good luck|`|MQ83HGD5aa	If you just had sex last week it's too early for her to be showing signs of pregnancy. She's freaking herself and you out and that is probably why she is late.|`|2W5YrwNYaa	Im sure just about everyone has been or known someone in this situation. First take a deep breath. If you guys used protection and there were no leaks or breaks then there is nothing to worry about. MOst likely her period is either late, could be due to increase of working out, eating habits and even stress. Perhaps stressing about being pregnant. Or it could be that her period is just off track. It happens to a lot of teen girls where their period will skip or move to another time of the month. Im about a week take a home pregnancy test. See the results. If it still comes out negative, a week later take another one. After that if its negative again go to a doctor or planned parent hood. My suggestion for you would be to talk with your girlfriend about birth control. If she goes on birth control, I would still use a condom. Then you will be double protected. I hope everything works out!|`|76hhm6Quaa	there is a chance she could be pregnant, but it sounds like her period is just alittle late. For most girls it is impossible to calculate the exact date of your "period" it is normally every 26-40 days, it varies woman to woman. If she has cramps it usually signals your period is coming. Like I said there is a chance she is pregnant, she should take an at home pregnancy test. If she takes a test and it is a negative wait another week and take another one. She could also contact her doctor for more advice and/or go to her doctors office for a pregnancy test.|`|ac8oQZLHaa	If you used protection and it didn't rip she should be fine. Maybe she is just a little off on her cycle. I would give it another week.
HSe6n5Tlaa	We have a video of my daughter at 3 months old laying on her back shaking her hands and tapping her feet to the beat of a musical toy!  She was totally right on the rhythm and kept beat!  Of course, mommy is a dancer.... so I take credit for this!  She is now going to be 2 years old in May and she follows simple tap and ballet dances!  She does still like to just boogy to fun music, clapping and twirling and swinging her arms and kicking out her legs, etc.  But whatever she does, she always keeps rhythm.  It's amazing.  <br>  My son is almost 3, and he has danced like a dork since he was 7-8 months old.  He hops side to side and swings his arms about and claps and jumps and sings.  He is my singer/musician.  He loves to play the piano while his sister dances.  He also enjoys the guitar and drums.  I love music and believe it is so important! I'm glad my kids inherited this trait!|`|ySKK7lCyaa	my daughter who is 11 months "Dances" in many different ways. When she is sitting down she bounces her body up and down. If your holding her she starts to bounce too. When she is walking she moves her arms about and wiggles. She is the cutest little dancer.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	My 10 month old has been holding onto the baby gate and jumping up and down. He laughs so hard and it is too cute.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	My twins like to sit on their bottoms and shuffle while nodding their entire head up and down.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	It depends on what kind of music she is listening to.  Any kind of country or oldies song she kind of swings her hips back and forth, really funny.  Rock/punk music she shakes her head and bounces around and with the Dora the explorer theme song or any other up beat song she puts her hands above her head and twirls around in circles.  She is very entertaining to watch:)  Shes 17 months.|`|yKS2UI87aa	My son usually turns in a circle (due to the Backyardigans) Sometimes he shakes his hips but Daddy taught him that.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	my best friends 6 month old boogies lol. she'll hold on to our fingers and stand her self up and just start shakin and rockin. she cracks her self up she starts screamin she gets so excited|`|723QHuicaa	she puts her hands in the air and waves them about, shakes her bum and spins around. Its uber cute.<br>  She is 18m old.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Thats sooo cute...<br>  <br>  My LO started dancing around the same time , she is a year now. She will dance to any music, she claps her hands and twists her upper body side to side, and picks up 1 foot at a time. if she is sitting she sways side to side. It all came natural as well, one day she just started to dance.lol

pXSKSS3daa	Oh yeah. If my son is teething he doesn't each much of his solid food and will only drink about 3-4 oz. at a time. And if his formula is warmed then he'll take a drink but then spit it right back out and let it run down his face.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that's what it was from with your daughter too.|`|ae5106e0ddfd7ecb434859ce61fcdd18aa	I think so. My 5 month old just got his first 2 teeth and normally he eats at least 5oz at a time, yesterday, he would only eat 3!<br>  Please do NOT use Orajel!!! Especially before a feeding! it can numb their throat and they can choke. Instead try the teething tablets. This was adviced by my son's doctor.|`|0IPxeDJiaa	Of course this could affect her appetite.  It might hurt to chew.  Make sure everything she eats is very soft and easy to eat.  You know how you're sick and you don't  feel like eating?  Same thing here.  Just make sure that what she IS eating is good in nutrition.  Maybe forget the spoon and have her feed herself with her hands (or you feed her by putting stuff in here mouth0.  Be patient and keep offering her food.  At this age too, they start to want to play with their food before eating it.<br>  <br>  Good luck - it IS worrisome, but normal.|`|uWlahQzkaa	I haven't had the teething experience yet however I have that what to expect the first year book and it says that it is normal for loss of appetite during teething|`|Z5s5DV6haa	my son started teething at 2 weeks, but he still wanted to breastfeed constantly. i guess every baby is different.|`|n3Y8nmQPaa	Use a little baby Oragel and rub it on her gums before she eats. Try some cold foods, ice cream, pudding etc.|`|8MeVnRxtaa	I think it could be. My son is only 4 months old but he started teething in his 3rd month. Sometimes when the pain is really bad he would want to eat but just would not because the pain was so bad. But i have also noticed when he goes through a growth spell he will want to sleep more and eat less.|`|4ZnrBThaaa	In the same boat! Totally normal and will most likely do it again when the next round of teeth come in. Good luck :) My baby is working on the top two teeth now..... I wish I could just pull them down and help her out. She is so miserable :(|`|OwvWjTGMaa	Yes,  I would not want to eat if my mouth hurt.  Plus some babies nose mybe  runny and eyes could be glossy.  Alot of babies teething may have a low grade fever.|`|xJ3v8UdFaa	most definitely! my niece did the same thing when she was teething. just rub a little bit of baby orajel on her teeth before she eats and try giving her cold stuff like ice cream or yogurt or something|`|DtGFWUP5aa	Definitely. Think about when you are in pain. You don't enjoy food as much do you?
LoP2CRE2aa	I love Violet! Isabel sounds cute with it, but I think Isabel is getting quite common for little girls these days. but, with a unique first name like Violet I don't think that would be a problem. I love it!|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I think that it is cute, but the word Violet just makes me think of violent, but if it doesn't make you think of that, it is a cute name.|`|DHW8x1d8aa	I like Violet Isabel, that spelling of Isabel is nice too<br>  <br>  I also saw Violet Cecilia on here earlier and thought that was a nice name<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7QTXV0Jkaa	I like Violet Isabella|`|UXxsDUECaa	Yes! I'm considering Violet for my girl too.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Yes I do.|`|5UC4h886aa	No|`|NWEJdpocaa	I'm glad someone else thinks that Violet almost sounds like violent...it's a cute middle name though. Isabel Violet would be better in my opinion. Good luck !!!|`|FL67UPPHaa	I love both names, and I have Isobel Violet on my list!<br>  <br>  I do think the name flows better that way round, but it works either way. I prefer the classic spelling Isobel to Isabel... but that's just a personal thing.<br>  <br>  I think it's a beautiful and feminine name. Great combo!

NPmRmnG6aa	They will ask you about your family history. Take your weight and blood pressure. Check you area, take measurement. They will do a blood test and get a urine sample (you will have to do a urine sample for the rest of your pregnancy). They may also do an ultrasound but this depends on your doctor.|`|utfoP7GWaa	On my first visit (5 weeks pg), all they did was confirm the pregnancy, and start me on my prenatal vitamins. They talked to me for a few minutes about what things to avoid, and how many calories to take in.<br>  <br>  The next visit (8 weeks) was my big visit. They did blood work, a paps smear, and scheduled me for an ultrasound!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It actually depends on your Dr. and their policy on what happens the first visit. At my Dr. all they do is an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy, take your weight and blood pressure and answer questions you may have and give your some information on what's coming up and testing and all that. At my 2nd visit is when they did another ultrasound for the trans. screening, blood work, pap test and STD tests, family history, weight check, blood pressure check and urine test. Often times, Dr.'s will do this at the first visit, but mine does it on the 2nd so the only way to know for sure is to ask them. At each visit I go to, I ask them what can I expect for the next visit that way I'm always prepared.|`|iwYu32N2aa	Well they will do a pap smear<br>   a urine test (and usually do one every visit)<br>  blood test<br>  check weight (every visit)<br>  check blood pressure (every visit)<br>  they will ask you about family history<br>  and they might give you a u/s, I never got one at my first appt but I hear alot of people say that they did.<br>   Good Luck and Congrats|`|MQ83HGD5aa	They will do the routine exam to make sure you are healthy and possibly a vaginal ultrasound to see if there is a visable heartbeat yet. But usually you can't see it until at least 6-8 weeks. So don't be too disappointed if you don't see it this time. Just relax and everything will be great!|`|jHH3G56Jaa	Congrats!!!<br>  <br>  They will take some blood for testing, weight you take your blood pressure, do a pelvic exam and most likely do an ultrasound.|`|NcQZXBCJaa	The first visit to the doctor is not that bad. They will ask you when your last period was. They will ask questions about your health history. And depending on when your last period was they may try to find the hart beat for the first time. They will give you a due date and prescribe you some prenatal vitamins. They may give you a pap it just depends on the doctor. They may also do some blood work to test for certain things. This is nothing to worry about. Then they will schedule you another doctors appointment Good luck and congratulations your pregnancy.|`|ACc1skbPaa	You'll have your regular GYN visit complete with Pap smear if you haven't had a routine physical in the most recent months...they will do an internal exam to see how large your uterus is and if you are approx. 12 weeks along, they will possibly do a doppler check to hear a heartbeat...don't panic if you can't hear it--sometimes the baby misbehaves and won't stay still for it or it is a bit early yet--if that's the case they may send you for an ultrasound to check things out and put you at ease, but they may not if they hear the heartbeat...they will ask you how you are feeling, what symptoms you have and what to expect before your next visit in the next month...they will also tell you what to call about and most likely they will encourage you not to be afraid to call about anything, even if you don't think it is a big deal...they will also send you out for bloodwork and set up your next appt.  You may even get some gifts!!  Formula and diaper companies love to have their reps drop off samples and toys and coupons for moms to be and it can be one of the first things that makes it all come home for you!  Good Luck and Congratulations!!|`|Iuzmk84Gaa	Congrats :)<br>  <br>  Your first appt. will involve calculating your due date. They may do a pap test if you haven't had one in the past year. They'll do your weight, blood pressure, depending on how far along you are they might try for the heartbeat (they normally don't try until after 12 weeks)|`|3L7D2TVWaa	pap smear if you havent had one lately<br>  calculate due date <br>  schedule an ultrasound<br>  try to hear the babies heartbeat, if youre at least 10 weeks along<br>  and at every appoitment they will check your urine for protien, your weight, and your blood pressure!<br>  Congrats and good luck!!
dR1yvax2aa	I know it's hard, but try not to worry about it.  If your son leaves home when he is 18, then at 7 weeks, more than two percent of the time he will spend with you is already gone!  Don't spend it looking at a scale! Enjoy this time!  It goes away way too fast!    As far as weight goes, genetics has much more to do with how your body stores fat and stuff than the simple height/weight charts would have you believe.  Try to focus on being fit, and don't worry about the fat.  If you're concerned, just make sure you're exercising.  Don't worry about the weight!  You've got a little boy!  You're breastfeeding!  That's awesome!  Woohoo!  :)|`|vm8HtVUYaa	Maybe it's 9 lbs. of milk storage; 4 1/2 lbs. per breast.    As long as it's not all in your tummy or butt you're fine. Going up a cup size (or two) isn't necessarily a bad thing.    If the 9 lbs. is placed in areas other than your breasts, I suggest drinking more water and doing more exercise.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	i breastfed until my daughter was 2 months and I didnt loose any weight I actually gained. I also tried eating healthy and everything. So I guess not everyone is the same. Try getting a pilates video and work out to that at least 2 times a week and I guarantee you will find some results. I lost 10 lbs by working out to pilates. I did it every other day for a good 3 weeks. Good Luck!|`|AA11543189	are you eating right and exercising some people think that breast feeding alone will help you lose all the weight you must eat healthy and exercise|`|dfc8429b66c51f108d73ce1342f5860daa	EXERCISE and eat right
8MeVnRxtaa	When i was breast feeding this happened to me but my son was having a tiny cold at the time. it was just a little bit of phlegm. It made me nervous too. I would call and ask your doctor just to make sure. you would probably be able to better describe it to them and have more details so they would be better to help you out. Good luck I hope all is fine.|`|VSWl45cKaa	It may be bile. Learn more here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.baby-medical-questions-and-answers.com/vomiting-bile.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baby-medical-questions-and-an...</a>|`|tLGbtmGsaa	It sound like bile (stomach acids etc). It also could be mucus that he swallowed.  If he is keeping most of his milk down I would not worry too much.  If he keeps throwing up green stuff then take him to the doctor or hospital because that is an early sign of dehydration.|`|Ka52nbhNaa	Has he ate anything green?  Green beans?  Anything like that which might be coming back up?<br>  <br>  Is he congested?  Could it be phlegm?  You might want to call the doctor - he could have a cold or a viral infection.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.
0792619596c4d5ccb67112a927699e6eaa	Getting beaten??  If you can't use birth control then keep your legs closed.  ABORTION IS NOT BIRTH CONTROL!!!!!!!!!!!  Stop killing your babies just because you won't use birth control or practice safe sex.  GROW UP!!!!!!!!|`|AA11031068	You have to deal with your own conscience and guilt. You have to look at yourself in the mirror knowing your irresponsibility and the fact that you have murdered to innocent babies that DID NOT ask to be created.<br>   You have to face God and his judgement.<br>  You could have problems with your major reproductive organs.<br>  You may deal with BAD KARMA cause truth be told WHAT GOES AROUND DOES COME BACK AROUND.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Increased risk of:<br>  <br>  Perforation<br>  Infection<br>  Infertility<br>  <br>  And the guilt of having murdered two babies, rather than just one.<br>  <br>  Forgiveness is available, but first you have to stop pretending it's okay.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Abortion isn't birth control so I'd find a good form of that first thing. If you plan to have kids one day you are taking the odds way down. If you have another ever the chances of you being able to carry a pregnancy will be slim.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	you'll never be able to have kids. stop using abortions as a form of birth control!!!! close your legs if you dont want to get pregnant!!!|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	it will make ur uterus weak and harder for you to carry a baby to term if you ever decide to have one.|`|h3HjLZ4daa	I'm sorry you are in this position but wouldn't even think to judge you on it.  my heart goes out to you.<br>  <br>  risks? well first off it depends on the procedure and timing itself.  it's not great to have your cervix mechanically dilated - that can cause issues, and there is a greater likelihood of bleeding and scarring.<br>  <br>  if they are done by a competent doctor then I think the risks are minimal - but there is an increased risk of preterm delivery of future babies with any abortion and I believe the risk would be elvated somewhat with more.<br>  <br>  but you DO need to talk to a doctor about it.  and I hope you have one that can speak to you honestly from a medical standpoint and not judge or push you one way or the other based on his or her moral viewpoint.|`|cf510fbc79fab61d326781329455381eaa	I am sorry to be brutally honest but if you are needing your 2nd abortion in a year you should really consider another form of contraceptive. Abortion isn't right, it is murder. There are so many people out there who want kids, but cannot conceive so just keep that in mind as you are killing yours.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	wow...so you get pregnant the first time and decide to kill that baby...and then are foolish enough to get pregnant again...and want to kill that baby as well?  great...wonderful.  not only responsible...but so kind to your babies.|`|LAsYy7C8aa	I think maybe you should talk to the practitioner about it and keep your legs closed.  I've had an abortion, I'm not anti abortion, but if you need to have 2 within a year...there is something wrong.|`|zBz10IiOaa	well here is one you may not ever get pregnant again or you can have several problems with your uterus and also  cyst's

145RUNQHaa	Sounds like separation anxiety.that may sound like something you would expect from a baby but it's common in toddlers of around this age.he may have started having nightmares or something is frightening in his room to him like shadows on the wall but what is more likely is that it's his developing intelligence this is the time when anxietys can develop.in my opinion crying it out methods should never be done.the message you send is when you're in distress i will not be there for you and that is going against your natural instincts to comfort your child.if he is experiencing anxietys then the only way to get him through it is to be there for him there's nothing wrong with letting him sleep in your bed but if it was me i would sleep in his bed with him for a few nights or as long as needed then he may regain his confidence a little and you can start getting back to your own bed.be patient because he won't be like that forever just give him time to learn how to handle is anxietys.if you want you could sit by his bed holding his hand and give him a hot water bottle in a fluffy cover as a comforter you probably wouldn't get much sleep that way but it's an idea.hope this helps.xx|`|AA12220887	Probably night terrors.  My daughter went through this at age 2 also.  It's a phase and he will outgrow it.  Just be patient with him.|`|vX7Xei50aa	im gessin he ahd some nightmares<br>  <br>  stay with him for a while and it shoudl go away soon|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Does he sleep with a small stuffed animal? Maybe you could give him one that you had when you were his age,makes it more special.
CMuL7XpKaa	Kristen?|`|LoP2CRE2aa	I guess I would say B. Like Kristin.<br>  <br>  I can see why noone pronounces it right though... Kristin and Christine (whichever one it is) are both pretty names, why make them more confusing by mispelling them? i guess constantly correcting everyone is just one of the prices you pay for trying to make a classic name more "unique" by creating some wacky spelling. Sadly, she will probably be correcting people her entire life and Kristin or Christine look much more professional on a resume, thats for sure.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	B-Chris-Ten|`|yznZqcznaa	Kristin<br>  <br>  Chris-tin|`|6vdttMYpaa	B. Like Kristin.To be fair to people if it had been spelt a bit more sensibly there wouldnt be the problems..|`|5vtVsqx6aa	D - other, I would pronounce it close to B, but Tin instead of Ten.<br>  <br>  So, Chris-Tin because of the "y"<br>  <br>  Pretty much like Kristin because the "h" is silent<br>  <br>  If her mother wanted something else, she probably should have spelled it another way!|`|IOQshyGMaa	Chris-Tin|`|bQCfOftxaa	B.

0792619596c4d5ccb67112a927699e6eaa	There's no way you're 23 unless you're special ed or something...  more like 2+3= 5...  From how you type, you sound too young to even be having sex. You don't even know how this stuff works??  When school finally teaches you how to use the english language better (like when you finally hit age 14 or something) then ask again.  No one can understand this crap...|`|rxScdXM4aa	ummm...i'm not sure|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	If it's been at least 30 days since your last period,take a home pregnancy test or see your doctor.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I have no idea what your question is. Are you asking if it's possible to get pregnant a week after having sex? If so, then yes, sperm can live inside of you for up to 5-6 days if all conditions are right. How do you know you didn't get pregnant that day or the next day after sex?|`|rdpZrBc9aa	If the questions is how can you tell that you're pregnant within a week after sex, the answer is that you CAN'T.  Wait another two or three weeks and take a test.|`|oMna3EOnaa	that question doesn't even make sense!|`|ACc1skbPaa	I don't understand your question but I feel safe in saying that you should pick up a pregnancy test, do the test and depending on the result, consult your OB/GYN...if you haven't gotten your period and the test is negative, contact your doctor...if you aren't interested in becoming pregnant--there are a million ways to prevent it, please look into them...good luck.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	that is confusing...<br>  info: sperm can survive up to 5 days inside so most people dont get pregnant they day they had sex (if that helps)|`|DHHREogbaa	You need to wait 14 days after unprotected sex to test.  This will be the first day to get an accurate answer.
F0rbWQL8aa	Implantation bleeding usually occurs 6-13 days after intercourse.  I think your period is starting.|`|Axcy1DYlaa	i bled at 6wks pregnant. I didnt know I was pregnant but I knew i was a little late. But then on a Sunday what I thought was my period started. It was very light and not much pink at all. like OLD blood ya know? (brown-dont mean to be gross) then it as gone by Tuesday morning. Took a test Tuesday and it was positive! There's no explanation for the bleeding, it wasn't implantation bleeding bc I was 6wks on that Tuesday I found out. the docs were never concerned bc it hasnt happened since.     Congrats if you are!!!!!!!!!|`|3oJL2Go3aa	It could be implantation bleeding unless it is starting to look like your normal period. If it is brown blood though that means it is old blood.|`|yzQAZMkoaa	i think its just old blood since you lasted a while to have it.

7pWMqi2oaa	Panties! She is used to the feeling of the diaper. And reward her. I used the stars and when she got so many, she got something small but special.|`|VHHis05Naa	You put her undies back on.  A diaper only teaches her that she can go to the bathroom in her pants.  Just be patient.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I would keep putting on fresh undies. Offer a reward system when she successfully goes in the potty. A sticker or piece of candy, whatever you choose. It's pretty much a bribe but if used correctly it's very successful. Lol my niece had the same problem. Once she learned she would get candy for going she was in and out of the bathroom. Good luck.|`|n6NthDxwaa	Use the panties. If she's telling you, she's got the idea, but her timing is off. Reverting back to diapers takes you 2 steps back. Try scheduling her toilet times every 30 min, and when she does go, praise her. I wouldn't suggest using candy rewards, but the stickers are a good idea. Using a stool and the toilet worked better for my daughter simply because she liked to flush when she was done!|`|AA11612508	just get ready to go threw tons an tons of pants and undies. thats the only way. i still go threw so many undies. we probably have roughly 30 pairs and that is what seem to work. just get an overflow of them, and also dresses work nicely for potty training lil girls. If they are standing at the time of pee pee it doesnt ruin their outfit.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Ask her if she'd rather wear underwear or pull-ups while she's still learning.  (I'm using pull-ups generically here, I know there are other brands.)  I wouldn't think diapers would help because she can't pull them down to use the potty.|`|AA12181625	ask her|`|KBirCZGFaa	Undies! Diapers will confuse her.  It's hard for little ones to tell the difference between diapers and undies, and how can she possibly be expected to understand different expectations based on what kind of pants she is wearing?  It's great that she is pooping and peeing in the potty!  <br>  <br>  Based on my latest potty-training experience with this book I read about it, this is my recommendation:  Let her know that you love her, but you don't like wet pants.  Don't show any sign of anger at all!  Teach her how to take off her wet pants and wear to put them.  If there's a puddle, teach her how to clean up after herself. Be sure that you are giving her praise for being neat as she cleans up.  <br>  If you want to take her training a step further, have her practice going to the potty as fast as she can from the location of the accident.  Practice several times, giving praise, and saying, "Good practice! Soon you will always have dry pants!"  If you practice like this, you might discover where the problem is.  Maybe you'll see she has a hard time getting to the potty from her upstairs bedroom, or she has a hard time unbuttoning her pants.  <br>  <br>  Good luck! Don't worry, it will happen!  She won't be entering high school with wet pants!
NPmRmnG6aa	Not me, I tried but your can't prevent them, if your genetics say your prone to get them you will most likely get them. There is no cream that can prevent them.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I did with my first.  And now I am 35 weeks with my second and none so far (fingers crossed).  I think my lack of stretch marks has something to with genetics and not gaining an excessive amount of weight.  My mother didn't get stretch marks, but my sister did.  My sister got some but not a lot.  But then again she gained more than the recommended weight with three of her four children.<br>  <br>  So genetics and gaining the recommended weight and gaining that weight slowly and steady are what I think are the real keys to avoiding stretch marks.|`|0viZhxi6aa	With my first baby I had NO stretch marks at all. Of course she was a smallish baby and I was only 18. I had my second baby 17 months later, and got a few on my hips. She was 2 pounds heavier and I had just turned 20. With my son I didn't get any until after he was born, (he was a preemie so I barely even had time to start showing until I was put on bed rest) and they are on my breasts! Thank goodness they're on the sides and near my armpits, because at least I can still wear lower cut shirts! Oh, and I'm 28 this time. Cocoa butter and all those expensive creams don't really work, but vitamin e oil on the dark ones will help them fade with time. I just call mine "battle wounds" and live with them because they're part of how I got my kids.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	i thought i was gonna lol so i focused all my attention on the stomach, turned out that my body doesn't get stretch marks on my belly, i get them everywhere else. some nice lady the other day posted bout her taking Vitamin E daily (but u have to ask a doctor if u can take them and how much of it, my OB said not more than 200mg) and rubbed Aloe extract on the stretch marks and they faded. my cocoa butter doesn't work for sht, so don't even waste ur money of that crap. but i still haven't tried that Vitamin E+Aloe yet.|`|nzY94B7waa	I have no idea how I managed to not get any stretch marks, but I did.  I didn't really do anything.  I did gain a good deal of weight.  I must have stretchy skin lol.  My sister has stretch marks really bad.  I was 115 when I found out I was pregnant with both my kids and 170 when I gave birth.  I don't know if it was the weight gain that helped.  I think they fade in time.|`|AA11109728	Yeah - my mom was the same way - she had 5 kids and said she never got any either!  Guess we are just lucky...|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Yes, I did 3 times. : )  <br>  Use cocoa butter (&/or lotion/oil with vitamin E) daily, several times a day and every time you're itchy. When your belly itches, it's because it's stretching and to avoid having the skin tear (which is what stretch marks are) you help the skin to stretch by using plenty of lotion and best in combination with oils (preferably vitamin E.) And do not stratch your itchy skin directly, only over your shirt and softly but I would try to avoid this as much as possible. <br>  Lotion up your hips and back as well.|`|AA11612508	i got them with my first, but not my second and hopefully not my third!!<br>  i think i was just so new at pregnancy i didnt know what i was doing either, i gained alot of weight and also never helped my skin with moisturizer at all. i think you learn alot for the second pregnancy.<br>  first pregnancy is kinda like someone threw you ina  dark room and you dont know whats going on till its all over wtih..haha ...really thou|`|39547d83a5156f9293d7f12e96038e86aa	i did the first time, and hopefully i will this time!  i used cocoa butter religiously, and my mother didn't get stretch marks either, so i think the genetics definitely helped me out there

Mine slowly grew (got bigger over time) but  5 months is when I really started showing...|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Everyone is different so there is not way to say because you're smaller you'll show more or less so it's not right or wrong! When you start getting bigger, the first few times of growth, I "popped" overnight. I had some ligament pain during that day and then when I got up the next morning it was a noticeable difference for me. After 2-3 times of that, for me it just keeps growing nothing major overnight anymore just constantly getting bigger!|`|jHH3G56Jaa	Every person is different as is every pregnancy.<br>  I am 5 months pregnant and still not showing exept for some extra skin so I look like I have a fat roll on my belly but it's a small one.

Just relax and enjoy your pregnancy.|`|nwWBddEnaa	when i was pregnant with my daughter it was about 32 weeks that i got a VERY small bump and it didn't get any bigger, no one knew i was pregnant unless i told them, and they still didn't believe that i was as far on as i said, im 22 weeks (beginning of 6 month) atm and no bump, depends on the person and how fast the baby grows, i wish you all the best x|`|IuJjYz6gaa	With my very first, I delivered at 31 weeks (she was stillborn) and was barely showing then.

LIke 20 weeks.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	I woke up at 15 weeks and a few days with my belly, lol! It was flat one day, and belly baby the next!<br>  If you were in very good shape then your ab muscles are really tight and that will actually take Longer for you to show!|`|NcQZXBCJaa	I was the same way with my first. I did not show for the longest time. Then one morning I woke up and it was like magic I had a belly. I did not start showing until I was bout 25 weeks along. Everyone kept asking me if I was pregnant. Some people say the smaller you are the faster you will show. That is true for some people. Don't worry you will stat start showing and it will be a great surprise. Good luck and congratulations.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Your belly will gradually grow.<br>  It's not uncommon to not show yet, especially when this is your first pregnancy and so your uterus has never stretched out this far yet (meaning after the first, you tend to show a little earlier.) <br>  Your belly sounds normal. A close friend of mine didn;t show with any of her babies until she was about 6 months and it really seemed like it was from one day to the next - lol. <br>  <br>  Don't worry - this time will fly and pretty soon you'll forget what you looked like before the big belly! <br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom!|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	I am a little over 3 months and i am showing a little bit, I feel like i am 4 or 5 months already lol. I think it just depends on your body and how fast your uterus expands for the baby, sometimes women go to 6 or 7 months before showing, I mean people around me may not notice that I am pregnant yet(they may think i put on a few pounds) but I def. can tell. =)<br>  <br>  Dont worry soon enough you will get your baby bump then it wont stop growing lol|`|rHwHAItGaa	I thought I was showing at around 4 months, but it was more of a not being able to suck in my own fat anymore.  I didn't actually get a rounded belly where it was noticeable that I was pregnant until 6 months, and I am still pretty small even at 36 weeks.  It also feels like my belly just appeared ... almost like I went to bed with a flat stomach and woke up with a beach ball in my belly.|`|zmbeIbx7aa	I am a bigger person and with my son I didn't start to show until I was 23 weeks and with this pregnancy I didn't show until I was 18 weeks. It all depends on how you are carrying. Everyone is different but normally you start to show anywhere from 18 to 24 weeks. I wouldn't worry to much and more than likely you will pop all at once it is quit a phenomenon.|`|4GwTDea1aa	i didnt start showing till about 5 1/2 months and yeah in a way its kind of like you wake up one morning and..wow where did this come from! but be patient you will get your belly soon enough and then you will move on to wanting to be thin again! and it doesnt really matter your size on the outside its the amount of room you have in your belly!<br>  Good Luck & Best Wishes|`|826c99fcf56ac4219e686a150815183baa	I too was petite when I got pregnant.  I didn't show til I was 6 months along!  It was SO frustrating because I wanted everyone to know I was pregnant.  The belly LITERALLY appeared overnight.|`|7oPZbdnEaa	i didn't start showing until my 5th month, the belly just appeared.  My dr. said its around the 4 1/2 to 5 th month mark where the baby really gets a growth spurt.  Congrats!! :)
Fh4B88ZGaa	Under 35, try for a total of one year. Over 35, call your doctor now.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Most Dr.'s won't help you until you have tried for 1 year as it can take up to 1 year for birth control to get out of your system completely.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	The experts suggest trying for a year but I would go ahead to the doctor and just tell then you have been trying for a year.  That way they can go ahead and get the ball rolling.  You can start taking prenatal vitamins, cut out any unhealthy habits you may have, watch your diet and drink plenty of water.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and lots of baby dust!|`|dgRTkccBaa	It depends how old you are.  Normally, an RE won't see you until you've been trying at least a year or if you have some known fertility or health issue.  Although, if you're over 35 they will see you after 6 months of trying.<br>  It can take a healthy couple up to 8 - 10 months, so don't lose hope just yet.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	1 yr.. most doc wont chack u unles its been a yr i took me 4 months & the i went to the doc she told me that it could take up to a year to get pregnant.|`|gdnL63ngaa	I went after 6 months and told the doc we were ttc for 12 months. I knew something was wrong and good thing we did. Some fertility clinics have 6+ months wait lists.<br>  <br>  If I waited a year I still woudln't have been pregnant.|`|UNWLaJbKaa	They say you should wait a year if you are under 35, and if you are over 35 then 6 months.  My hubby and I have been trying now for 3 months, and today I got my first Positive.  He said if we didn't get it this time around he wanted to get his little guys tested since he is 42, and I am 30.  It seemed like everyone around us was preggo (and I mean a lot of people) so we just kind of felt left out.  I did talk to my friends who are in the early to mid thirties and it took them 4 months, 6 months, and 8 months.  The one who took her 8 months was actually  making an appt to see a fertility dr when she found out she was pregnant, but she is over 40.<br>  <br>  It's funny this month I told myself i'm not going to get worked up about it if  i'm not, and layed off the "obsessing part" and presto i'm pregnant.<br>  <br>  One more thing I noticed about myself was that the first 2 months my EWCM was very cloudy and almost like a glob.  This month I didn't get that at all, and got what they truly describe as an egg white CM clear and slippery, and stretchy.  So I guess it took a few months for my body to adjust to being off the pill, which I was on for 5 years.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you,|`|yea2hci5aa	Usually women wait till a year after ttc to consult a doctor.  I don't think your previous miscarriage is causing the delay in conceiving.  Your body may be still trying to get into a normal cycle after being on bc.  I would make an appointment with your doctor so they can check whether or not you're even ovulating yet.  It can take some women a while after stopping bc to ovulate.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	i would go to the doctor so that they can help you get the timing right. Oter factors can be that you might not be ovulating due to eating habits... body weight... drinking smoking... there are several things that cause woman to not ovulate. maybe stress on the body from working out a lot... etc.|`|SHBpzAIZaa	For someone your age, doctors like for you to try on your own for 1 year. If you dont feel that you want to wait that long, go ahead and go to the doctor and discuss your options. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you!|`|F3BRG72iaa	i believe most doctor's would recommend one year before fertility treatments but if you're really wanting a baby now i dont see why you cant go...good luck and lots of baby dust to you :)|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	Why not start the discussion now?  You do not need to jump in with both feet right away and start all the meds, injections, BILLS and stress.<br>  A miscarriage could just be normal or telling you something could be wrong.<br>  There are some very simple tests they can start with like seeing if after sex there is sperm in the right place to become pregnant.  To see if your body hurts his sperm (kills it).  You may be producing a chemical that his sperm finds toxic.<br>  Have your hormones levels checked at certain times of the month.<br>  Have his sperm checked for his count is another simple thing to do.<br>  If you want more than one child than make an appointment now with your regular OB and suggest the above tests since these tests can be done by them and not a very expensive infertility Dr..  The reason I mention this is if a problem is happening than it can be resolved in time to have more than one child at a good age for you.  Infertility takes so long sometimes to get even one baby.  Unexplained infertility to me is the most frustrating but there is always hope.<br>  These tests will all take a few months to do and if by that time you are not pregnant than the year is up and you can than move on to the big guys.<br>  A reminder is do not use clomid for more than 3 to 5 tries.  If it hasn't worked in 3 tries it's a waste of your money and time.  Of course there is always an exception to this rule but most infertility Dr.s do not do more than that.  OB's will give it to you over and over wasting a good year of your life and clomid can really mess with your emotions and add a ton of stress.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Kath
etV271ARaa	Expose her more. Take her out with you everywhere and encourage her to speak to people both children and adults. That really builds up her confidence and shell be able to interact better. But I think she'll be ok. My 5 year year old is so talkative and bold and it guess its because Ive exposed her to a lot|`|AA12220887	I'm having the same issues with my 3.5 year old at preschool.  She's very shy and clingy and doesn't want me to leave even though we've been going since September.  I think it's because she's with me 90% of the time.  Are you a stay-at-home Mom and does your daughter spend most of her time with just you?  My daughter's teacher suggested as much peer time as possible --- play groups, park, neighbors, cousins, and just continual praise.  In time, your daughter will come out of her shell.  Just be patient.
