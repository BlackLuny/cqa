I'm going to be starting college in two years and I am curious to knowing as to which language I should learn based on usefulness and ease of ability to learn. Some of the choices that I have considered are Korean, Thai, Norwegian or Swedish (Scandinavian languages are very similar) and Italian. I wont be spending much of my own travel time here in the US so I think something European other then English could come in handy. But I'll be backpacking across both Europe and Asia so its a bit of a hard choice to pick a single language to learn.
20090222155118AACvJKD	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How would you deal with someone who can't take a hint?	This woman I know comes over frequently because we rent a house her parents own. She often comes over at dinner time and invites herself to eat even at times when we are low on grocery money. She sometimes calls and says she is coming over and won't stay long or she'll invite herself to go with us on family outings. She is not married and has never had kids, so it is obvious she is lonely. It is frustrating because I like my privacy and don't like confrontations either. I have dropped hints in the past about being tired, or having little food to go around, but my hints are not obvious enough. I don't want to be super rude and piss her off because I don't want her parents to kick us out. How can I be more assertive without being rude? Keep in mind this woman is very hardheaded when it comes to dropping hints.

20090222160210AANq3UF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	CATHOLICS ONLY! READ DISCRIPTION BEFORE ANSWERING!?	Why do Catholics say God and Jesus are so merciful and loving. Finish reading before you answer. I have found two Bible versus that can prove they aren't as merciful and loving as they are claimed to be. First one is about Jesus:   Mark 11:11-19    11 Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.       Jesus Curses a Fig Tree and Clears the Temple Courts    12 The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. 13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. 14 Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.        15 On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves, 16 and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. 17 And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations' [a]? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.' [b]"           18 The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.           19 When evening came, Jesus and his disciples [c] went out of the city.      That doesn't sound so loving. Cursing the fig tree because it wasn't the fig season? Overturning stands? Not vey loving.      Now God not being as loving and merciful as perseived:   6 He said to me: "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. 7 Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children. 8 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."       That is Revelations 21:6-8. How is that loving and merciful? He is cleary showing favourtism to certain people. All the people that don't believe everything he says will be thrown into the sulfur and have a second death? Is that merciful?      Thanks for reading,   ~Templar Rock!

I have to write a narrative fictional essay of The Great Depression, however, I don't want to write about the Stock Market Crash, or the presidential election, I want to write about a teenagers experience of the time. I have chosen my main character to be a young teen, named Kate. I have done some research, but have not gotten a lot of results. I want to story to center around the hardships that she experiences.   This is what I learned from my research:      -Black tuesday      -Roaring twenties      -"flappers"      -apple stands on the street corners      -men leaving home in search of jobs      -hobos/Hoovervilles      -bread lines/soup kitchens      I want part of it to be her comparing her present life to her former priveleged life, but I still need some research, and I am completely clueless as to what the events throughout the story will be, because it can't just be her sulking about being poor. So if you have any ideas as to what the events throughout this story should be, please answer! Also, if you happen to have lived through that time, please share your experience as a child or teen!   Thank you for your time!

I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..?

20090222162128AAnEP8V	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, if, as so many of you say, you need "the holy spirit in your heart to really understand the bible"?	...then why do so many of you rely on preachers/pastors/priests to interpret it for you?      Do you think they have more of the "holy spirit" in them?  But if that were true, then there wouldn't be 10,000 christian denominations, would there?  I mean, if these preachers were that much better able to understand the bible's message, then there should be no dissension.      So what good is the "holy spirit" when interpreting the bible?  If that meant anything at all, you'd all agree.  So having said that, that would make an atheist's (or Buddhists, or Muslims, etc) interpretation of the bible just as valid as yours or your priests, no?

My sister found out she was pregnant  instead of being honest with her best friend at the time she told some phony random lies to her to cover up the truth, she acted really weird. I guess it was her way off handling the pressure situation. She called her up the next day to apologize(her friend knew she was lieng at the time) but her friend felt so hurt and betrayed she cut her out of her life. My sister later went to her house and bought her chocolate. But she wanted nothing to do with her.       How would you react to my sister in this situation?      Is her best friend being selfish and overreacting?      Would you look past the lie and help her through the situation or drop her because she lied to your face and cant be trusted again?   Be Honest      My sister later found out she wasnt pregnant by the way.

Also, what about all the religions in the modern world? Not everyone can be correct. So even is there is a higher power, someone has to be wrong. Also, I think its funny when in combat(especially back in medieval times) two sides of a battle would pray and say they would win because they had god on their side. That doesn't mean much cause someone has to loose(their are no real ties in a war). After wards, they will say they didn't believe in him enough or didn't pray well enough and that's why they weren't blessed.      I don't believe in any higher power just so no one gets confused with me and possibly takes this as me have a god that's the "right" one.

20090222105726AAmwhK5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Yahoo, i am now ready to submit my doctorate thesis?	After using R&S extensively for 2 days, i have established a firm working knowledge in the major religions of the world. I have also completely grasped all laws of physics, especialy quantam mechanics and relativity theories, and i have also made a comprehensive overveiw of all major philisophical schools of thought by watching two videos on youtube (venomfangx)      So with no further ado, i would like to present my doctorate thesis on why the world is.      Well god clearly is the link that will reconcile the quantam unreality with the accepted classical laws of reality, he is also the devine superposition of the positron.       Humans are put on this earth to follow the laws of physics and even though jesus came down and tried to say that we are no longer under the law but under the grace i still hold the fundimental veiw point that evolution contradicts the THEORY of gravity.      Evil is in this world because humans introduced it via the free will of satan that god superimposed (as we both know that he displays both wave and particle like behaviour) and the only way to get rid of evil is to observe diffraction of electrons in a cloud chamber.      I have also, after a detailed reading of a few random pages of the bible and quran established that they are the same book in different languages.      Ok so that is my doctoral thesis, am i now a top contributor?   Will i be recognized with any award for this truly ground breaking research?

I think it's pretty evident that Jesus was a composite character compiled over many years.He serves as a two-bit mouth piece to appease just about anyone who reads the Bible.       Liberal Christians think of him more as a hippie who worked to overthrow the rich. Conservative fundies like the fact that Jesus is a stern father figure with uncorrupted morals. During the crusades people were probably inspired by the famous  "I come not to bring peace but a sword" speech by Jesus.

For Me..   1. it was my neighbor friends grandmother who taught me about GOD at 5 yrs old and discipline for the LORD, she made us sit at the table every weekend read from the Bible before we could play...She has been dead for a number of years but I will always be eternally grateful for what she did in introducing me to the GOD of my life.      Even though I spent a number of years living my way, I always thought about GOD and prayed that I would follow him like (Grandma) taught me,,,and of course eventually  I did...;)      2.
20090222101652AAWUPqC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How did an Ancient People know what people would be like in 2000 years?	If it wasn't for Divine Intervention..The Disciples of Jesus had no formal education, they were not schooled in Psychiatry or Sociology or Human Studies, yet they paint a picture of the Last DAYS and what a Modern People would be like..      How did they do that?, what knowledge were they privvy to if not for GOD?    (2 Timothy 3:1-5 NIV) But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. {2} People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, {3} without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, {4} treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God-- {5} having a form of godliness but denying its power..How did they know that Apostasy would come?   That people would reject the Bible and make GOD what they wanted him to be and make up there own Laws for Behaviour..      Could any of us today or the Greatest Minds in the world figure out what people's behaviour would be like in 2000 yrs?

20090222101854AASObGH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can christians believe in evolution?	It doesn't make sense to me. As an agnostic. I know they say you can if you don't take the bible literally you can believe it. How can you believe that we have original sin or can accept Jesus if you evolved from an ape. I mean if you believe god created us in him image then why were we apes before that.       Christians also believes that animals don't have souls. Well we still are animals or at least were once animals according to biology and evolution. We are considered "Great Apes".       So when did we start to have a soul according to christians who believe in evolution? When did our species start having the consequence for going to hell?  Is it when we started to look human, I mean this makes christians look really stupid. (No offense)      I just don't get the illogical statements some christians are making. You can see that religion and science don't mix, so you either have to believe in faith or logic.

20090222101010AA0EM73	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is it legal for Christians to attach their book of doctrine to the Hebrew scriptures?	The Hebrew scriptures is an entirely separate book from the Christian New Testament.  The  Hebrew scriptures were written down by God's prophets who were Africans.  The Christian New Testament was written by Europeans and holds much of the Roman Emperor Constantine's views.  Writings from two different races from different centuries and yet both books are considered as being from the same source.  This is blasphemy.  The Hebrew scriptures are holy, it contains the commandments and laws of God which are eternal.  The Christian New Testament however, is founded on the laws and teachings of men.  It is full of pagan beliefs and contradicts the word of God.  The insane information found in the Christian New Testament is the reason why so many people reject the existence of God.      There ought to be a law preventing the Christian doctrine from being bound to the Hebrew scriptures.  How can a book of truth be partnered with a book of lies?

20090222123735AAoCup5	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What should I do, Need Advice! Urgently?	Please, forgive the length of this question. I don't know what the hell I got myself into, here's some background. I had a neighbor a few years back who I had a crush on, but never said anything. Neither did she, but I know she liked me by the way she would look at me...anyway, I moved to Texas and apparently so did she because my mom ran into her a few months back... anyway, I gave her a Christmas card with a few bucks in it $40...she started texting me. And we would text each other pretty frequently, this has been going on for about two months now.  I've only talked to her once on the phone and the conversation wasn't all that great, so I lied and told her I'm not a phone person so she wouldn't be upset. Thing is I gave her a card with $100 and a small box of candy before valentine's day because I wouldn't be able to give on valentine's day. Anyway, she thanked me and I told her I wanted to get to know her better, she said that wasn't a problem. She also said she'd never had anyone to do anything like that for her, I told her I just wanted to make her feel special. She asked my why I did that, I said because I liked her. Well, I liked what I knew.    She asked me how I was doing and I said fine because no one was aggravating the ish out of me, anyway I think she may have thought I was talking about. I wasn't.   I don't know if I said the wrong thing to her or what, I haven't heard from her in about a week.   I told her she should be more assertive with me, in other words I want to be chased. I'm used to women chasing me, but she seems to be different kind of hard to get. I sent a text to her apologizing on valentine's day she hasn't replied yet, which I thought was rude as hell. I sent her a text telling her that I would not bother her anymore. My friends all tell me she seems to be chemically imbalanced, but that hasn't even stopped me from wanting to well, you know. What should I do? I don't want her to think I'm running behind her. But I'm really p/o with the whole situation. Also, I made a date that I had to cancel, but I did text her saying something came up, she didn't respond for days when I sent her another text asking what was going on and if she got my message. She seemed p/o with me, and sorta texted the same message I had sent her which let me know she got the message,  I explained  the reason for me taking a raincheck. She told me she was off, dropping a hint for me I guess to offer  to  take her out. I didn't reply. She's dropped quite a few hints, but I'm usually really busy. Almost forgot when we talked she kept calling me a player, which is so not true.   My question is should  I consider it a loss of a few bucks and move on. Or wait to see what she does.  And why is she putting me through this kinda hell?! I've never had a woman to do this to me before.   If she wasn't interested she could've just said that to me. I've kinda loss interest in her I guess what she's doing isn't what I used of, I know that almost sounds arrogant but I don't mean it that way. Did I make a huge mistake by telling her I've always liked her, w because my best friend told me after that was a huge mistake. She said I shouldn't have said I've always had a crush on her. Another thing is she hasn't said that to me, so now I feel like a complete a**. And now my friend is telling me I should ask for my money back, which I think is kinda tacky. But it didn't work out the way I planned, and I've never done that before. I've sent women flowers but never given money to anyone that I wasn't involved with. But that always worked out for me. I don't understand why all of a sudden she has the cold shoulder with me. And I really don't why I like her, because she isn't pretty or anything like that, she has bad ache. This is just so out of character for me, even my mother said she doesn't see what it could be in her. Because she's used to seeing me with pretty women. She also said that she wasn't good enough for me, which kinda of hurt my feelings to hear my mother say something like that, because my mom is usually so sweet to everyone. I apologize for any grammatical errors in advance. Thanks for any relevant advice.

I want to get a tattoo of a cross on my forearm, but im not sure about the design of the actual cross.      I think I want Hebrews 15:3 underneath it which states "God has said, "never will I leave you never will I forsake you".      So I want a cross design with maybe something that looks like a depressed type of mood, but with hope...or someything like that.      Or just a really good cross design for my forearm.      Thanks..      And I don't want to hear how getting a tattoo is a sin...I already have one, and I don't believe that it is a sin.  A sin is something that seperates us from God, and in no way does me putting a cross on my arm seperate me from fellowship with God.

I would risk having to pay a restock fee if it doesn't fit.  I really can't fly out to St. George, UT just to find a dress that covers my shoulders!      I know David's Bridal has "sleeves" that can be added if that's what you want to call them. They look too sheer for my tastes. Any modest brides out there willing to help me?  I would prefer cap-sleeves.  I would consider sleeveless if it had a lot of coverage.      If it makes a difference, I am totally open to wearing a used gown.
20090222115449AAcLkuq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For those of you who blame God?	Watch this video:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtweZxNGk...       After watching, please read this:   You say God does not love us, and that He does not heal, or give miracles, and you become stubborn, and angry with God. Well, this man has all the reason to be angry at God, but he is not, because he realizes that we all have crosses to carry, and we do not deserve any of God's gifts. God gives us the gift of life, the gift of salvation, and many more gifts, and yet we are not satisfied. We always want more, and more, and when things get a little tough, we grow angry at God, and blaspheme Him, when we are undeserving of everything He gives us. God loves us all, and Nick realizes that, and he praises God, so when you think your life is horrible, and you are angry with God, realize that He loves us all, and we are undeserving of His love.   I just wanted to read your thoughts on this.   With love in Christ.

20090222115509AAN5lFt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you believe in the triunity of God?	First Epistle Of Saint John    Chapter 5   7 And there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.      This is one of the GREATEST verses testifying of the trinity.      Is  this verse in your Bible? How do you interpret it's meaning? If the wording is changed, how so?      I lenghtened this question, but you can answer at this point and disregard the following. Thanks for your answers and no offence taken...just asking a question.      Christian belief in God as triune did not arise in the fourth century with Roman emporer Constantine and the Christian bishops that he dominated.    Belief that it arose then was part of a vague paganizing or Hellenizing of Christianity is a caricature often promoted by anti-trinitarian cults and sects.   It's that "the most significant developments in articulating" the doctrine of the Triune God took place in the 4th century, A.D.       In Scripture there is as yet no single term by which the Three Divine Persons are denoted together.    The word trias (of which the Latin trinitas is a translation) is first found in Theophilus of Antioch about A.D. 180. He speaks of "the Trinity of God [the Father], His Word and His Wisdom (To Autolycus ). The term may, of course, have been in use before his time.    Afterwards it appears in its Latin form of trinitas in Tertullian .    In the next century the word is in general use. It is found in many passages of Origen.      The various elements of the Trinitarian doctrine are all expressly taught in the New Testament. The Divinity of the Three Persons is asserted or implied in passages too numerous to count.    The early Fathers were persuaded that indications of the doctrine of the Trinity must exist in the Old Testament and they found such indications in not a few passages. Many of them not merely believed that the Prophets had testified of it, they held that it had been made known even to the Patriarch.      So my question is do you believe in the Trinity, why or why Not?   And also, does John 5:7 read in your Bible as it does above? If not, explain in brief, how it is differently worded or how it is worded that deletes the concept of the Trinity.

I just read this on catholic.org      "Lenten practices of penance have great benefits for our spiritual lives. A serious Lent will be like a spring cleaning which will purify the clutter that has accumulated in our souls. A serious commitment to penance will also help us to conquer addictions, obsessions and compulsive behavior. A serious Lent will purify our soul and allow us to experience a deeper interior freedom.      As we approach the beginning of another Lent, we should carefully examine our lives. Usually we focus on carefully examining our sins, but do we ever consider the sins of omission? Do we honestly consider what we are not doing?"      Father James is absolutely right.

Recently i have been watching some of venomfangx videos, if you are not familiar with him he is a creationist christian who makes videos which generally Challenge the validity of evolution and the surrounding science.       Whilst watching his videos i came across a user called thunderf00t, he has a series of videos called 'why do people laugh at creationists', it deals with some of the core creationist claims and tackles some of the biggest creationist videos, i wondered would any of you be willing to watch just a few, (as i have been open minded enough to watch venomfang) of these videos, and let me know what you think, you can answer this question or email me, i would like to know where exactly you find fault with his videos.      All i ask is for say 4 minutes of your time (average video length) and i strongly suspect you will enjoy his videos. If you wont watch i would be interested in knowing why, and 'im busy' doesn't really apply here as we all know anyone on yahoo isn't to busy to watch a four minute video.

20090222123904AAT8uom	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, has this happened to you yet?	Y'know. I've heard the stories, but I never actually thought someone -who I have never met- would have the audacity to come up to me and preach to me publicly.       I just got a copy of the book God Is Not Great by Christopher Hitchens, and because my iPod charger  broke [ :(  so sad ] I've been reading it on the subway.      So there I was on my way to my friends house, minding my own damn business, and this guy came up to me and started preaching at me. For 30 minutes straight. Every time I tried to turn back to my book he would interrupt me, and its not like I could just get away, it was a packed car and I was stuck in my seat until my stop came up.      Nevermind what he said, it was all nonsense (One of my favorite moments was when he told me that I would never die a natural death because of the end of days in 2012- to which I responded "Unless I kill myself tomorrow.")  By the minute I got angrier and angrier. I know he had good intentions, but who the f*ck did he think he was?       Anyway, he gave me his email on a business card as I left. Should I email him and give him a taste of his own medicine? I think he was asking for it.

20090222115615AAB5Y0t	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should I be baptised?	This might be a little long, but I'd really appreciate people reading it and giving me their views.      I was brought up in the Church of Scotland and was baptised as a baby. My maternal grandfather was the minister who baptised me at that time.      I stayed in the church of Scotland until I was about 13, then started going to an Evangelical church which advocated adult baptism. When I was about 15, I asked my mum what she would think about me being baptised. She said that she felt it was unneccessary since I'd been baptised as a baby, and said that she didn't want me to be baptised as she felt it would be offensive to my grandpa (as though I was saying that I felt him baptising me wasn't good enough and I needed to do it again).      Fast forward to now, I'm 26 years old and settled in an Elim Pentecostal church which I'm very happy in, and again the topic of baptism has come up. I want to be baptised, I believe that it's what God wants from me and that I should do it. But I'm concerned about offending my family, because I know my mum doesn't want me to do it.      So what do I do? Yes, I'm an adult, I've been living away from my parents for 8 and a half years, but I still don't like to go against their wishes. Do I just get baptised but not tell them? Or should I tell them and risk upsetting them? Or does anyone else think that I should not be baptised just to please them?      I'd really appreciate any opinions. Thanks.

20090222115421AAEABmy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did you know the bible allows multiple marriages at any one time?	I have looked into the bible - and have found some intriguing information.    Where did the concept of only ONE WIFE come from?      In Exodus 21:10, a man can marry an infinite amount of women without any limits to how many he can marry.      In 2 Samuel 5:13; 1 Chronicles 3:1-9, 14:3, King David had six wives and numerous concubines.      In 1 Kings 11:3, King Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.      In 2 Chronicles 11:21, King Solomon's son Rehoboam had 18 wives and 60 concubines.      In Deuteronomy 21:15 "If a man has two wives, and he loves one but not the other, and both bear him sons...."      In the New Testament   Jesus said: "DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE COME TO ABOLISH THE LAW (THE OLD TESTAMENT) OR THE PROPHETS; I HAVE NOT COME TO ABOLISH THEM BUT TO FULFIL THEM.  I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke or a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law (the Old Testament) until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18)"      According to Matthew 5:17-18 above, we clearly see that Jesus honored the Old Testament, and forces Christians to follow the unmodified laws of it that have not been replaced by newer ones in the New Testament.  The Old Testament as we clearly see above does indeed allow polygamy without a shadow of a doubt.      Matthew 19:3 does allow polygamy       http://www.biblicalpolygamy.com/     http://www.christianpolygamy.com/

I don't commit myself fully to one particular belief,  because I believe more than one religion.        However, my family members are christain... but I do not believe that since they are christian that I have to believe everything of that religion.  Is this considered normal?  I know I'm still discovering myself at this age.  and my opinions will most likely change when I begin to grow older, that way I would know more about each belief.

20090222110918AAOaMTA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why I think man created god?	Humans want answers. If they cannot explain something they will make something up to explain it. We have examples of this such as early humans didn't know how lightning worked so they created a god called Zeus.       I believe its the same scenario today, when we cannot explain how we got here due to the limits of our current technology.       Answer me this theist. Would you believe in a god if science could give you all the answers and prove that there is no god in the picture?

I mean, its rude and not very nice so sit there and say If you have the time to make fun of others because they believe something different then you obviously have to much time on your hands!   I dont AGREE with catholics! I dont AGREE with Jewish! That is their belief and they can believe what they want to go to hell, their choice. I will tell them, but only in love, because god tells us to spread the word. People need to stop critisizing other because they have faith!!!      Just because YOU dont have faith, doesn't mean the rest of us cant have any!

20090222121821AAziZyU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do Christians reconcile this dilemma on the source of morality?	Are the laws of the bible moral because God dictates them, or does God dictate them because they are moral?      If the former, then morality is arbitrary as God could have simply decreed that it is a moral act to force sexual intercourse upon someone (indeed the bible is strangely silent on the subject of rape).       If it's the latter then what do we need God for? Surely we would be able to discern what is moral and what isn't by our own reckoning (indeed we have if we look at cultures around the world who have never been exposed to the bible and yet seem to understand that murder and theft are punishable offenses).

20090222121909AAkxQK5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	My mom just asked me if I believe in god... what do I do now?!?	So I haven't been going to church for about 2 years... my mom and I finally had the conversation we had been putting off for a long time...   she asked if I believe in God, and I basically said "I don't know"      I can tell this is the first in a lot of conversations.... my dad's a priest, and my mother is a deeply religious person.  I have a personal case against Christianity, which is a list of all the reasons I don't believe in at least that God...       what the hell do I do?! I can tell it hurt my mom deeply... Do I tell her my case, or do I simply not talk about it with her, and agree to disagree? I think she might feel a little better that I've thought deeply about it if I lay down my case, but I'm afraid she's start to doubt her faith, as well... Religion has been a huge part of their lives... I don't know what I should do. If I don't say anything, they'll feel horrible about it anyway. what do I do?!

Yes, I know someone is going to answer that he is educated and a believer, but he is probably 1% of those who continue to believe after going to school.
20090222123734AAmeAqS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think it would be possible for atheists and christians to not fight?	I'm atheist. No, I really am. I'm not a Christian who has delusions. I was born atheist, raised atheist, and I am still atheist. I don't know what it means to believe in any form of a God. I don't worship Darwin as my God or anything.       But something I'm sure other people realize is that I don't really understand why Christians pick on us atheists or want to drive us out of the country or spout so much hatred. I'm sure there are some of us who are intolerant of other religions but all the atheists I have ever met support any person who wants to be involved with a particular religion. I think it's fantastic if someone finds Jesus as their savior. Some of us like sparking fights with Christians and question their faith. A lot of other atheists don't really care, and find it an annoyance that Christians intrude in our everyday life. I don't like it when people hand me a bible or a pamphlet on the street. I don't like it when people try to convince me to go to church. You might say that this is God trying to reach out for me. I have been to church before, I have read the Bible. I still don't believe it's true. What if Christians just accepted that atheists are going to be atheists? Many atheists accept that Christians will be Christians. I find that I have to put up with more annoyances from the Christian community than I see exerted on the Christian community.       Atheists are not evil people. Many atheists do really great things as people. We donate to charities, we become doctors and go out to different countries to help support the sick and the ill. We do all of this and we don't expect a reward from God. In fact, we know we're going to Hell (if there is one). You don't have to tell us. We're well aware of that fact. We will probably know more people in Hell than we will know in Heaven. Let us marry who we want to marry. Christian marriages are not the only marriages possible, so what the bible says shouldn't apply to people who don't even believe the bible is right in the first place. Other non-cultures also endorse marriages.      We know you want to help us. We're very thankful for the thought, but we don't really want your help. I'm sure it will be wonderful and you will guarentee a great place in heaven if you convert as many of us as you can, but I don't really see that as being a good use of time or as being selfless. There are plenty more things you could do that could be of greater help to people who actually need something because I think it's possible for us to decide for ourselves what we want to believe in and how we want to live... and how we want to deal with our own bodies.

I remember going to a spooky Christian camp when I was little (where they wanted us to speak in tongues and believe demons inhabit our toys), and someone was saying it was perhaps part of a pentacostal religion.      Can you tell me which denominations appear a little too strange for your, or a little too "wild" (using fear as an operator?  I've heard of evangelical, foursquare, non-denominational, church of Christ, Church of God, Seventh day adventist, etc.      I was never raised a Christian, but I am interested in attending Christian services, but am weary of the super "lively" ones.  Which ones are a little too much for you (the ones that preach fire and brimstone too much or perhaps a little too "cultish")?      Again, not trying to knock anyone's church.

20090222115246AA4kLOj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Something that has been bothering me for a while.?	I consider myself to be an athiest, although I'm not necessarily saying there isn't some higher power. I used to be a Christian, but not for the last five years. I didn't practice my faith heavily and I don't know everything there is to know about Christianity.      So here's the thing:      I have denounced God and Jesus Christ as my savior, but I do well in school, I treat others like I want to be treated, I don't do drugs, I'm respectful to those who are older than me, I try not to start any fights, I try not to be judgmental...you get the picture. I'm not perfect, but I try to be the best person I can be.      But let's say there is someone who considers themselves to be a Christian, considers Jesus to be his savior. But he cheats, steals, breaks the laws, etc.      And let's say God exists. Will he go to heaven over me?

So does this mean the Watchtower Society is not excercising faith in Jesus? Because many members of the Watchtower society have died. Jesus said you would never die, if you "observed his teachings".       Did Jesus lie in John 8:51 and John 11:26 ?

Me and my girlfriend were having sex today, and right before she was about to climax, she pulled my hand away. She always does this. She is madly in love with me and I am with her, she is the love of my life. But today when I asked her to explain to me why she isn't ready to have an orgasm yet she said because they're supposed to be this big amazing feeling that rushes through you, makes you convulse and go wild. It's supposed to be the most amazing feeling you can experience. I can't understand why she wouldn't want it. And to tell the truth, it kind of hurts my feelings, because she said that she's afraid that it'll hit that point, and it'll never get better after that. Like getting an orgasm is the main goal in sex, and once it's achieved it will never be the same.   ??? I am really having a hard time understanding this. And I know she wants it because she almost let me do it today. I just need to either understand, or help her somehow realize that it's okay to have an orgasm, and that people have sex everyday, have orgasms, and love it. haha. Please help me.       :/
20090222165546AAlxA2z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If you're an atheist, from whence do human rights come?	One of the sources of human rights is so-called natural law, that is, people have certain rights because, to quote Thomas Jefferson, "they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights."      If you don't believe in a Supreme Being, where do human rights come from?  Would it be safe to say that in such a scenario human rights are wildly subjective based upon current understanding?      Note that I am not suggesting that you have to be a theist to believe in human rights, but it seems to me that the concept of immutable rights is a little flawed without the acknowledgment of a Supreme Being being the source of it.      Thoughts?        Cheers!

Two of my friends came to my home for the first time since I moved about 4 years ago. They stayed here in my house, but a few days before they arrived they informed me that there were some guys coming here from another city to meet them also. I was stunned, but said nothing. The whole weekend, with exception of shopping on Friday 2 hours, and gambling Saturday 3 hours, I was the 3rd wheel. I felt like I was a tour guide for a double date or something. Dont get me wrong, we did have some fun, but it was a very awkward and uncomfortable situation, being the 3rd wheel like that. And they wanted to stay with the guys at their hotel on Sat. night.(they didnt because they didnt bring a change of clothes, which were at my house) I feel very much like I was used for a scapegoat for my one friend, who is married, just to be able to get out of town to see this guy. I did tell them I felt like a 3rd wheel on the first night, which didnt seem to matter too much because they insisted we hang out with the guys again the second night as well. Is it worth it even mentioning again or should I just leave it alone. I dont even think I want to invite them back again after this.

20090222162224AAIoBtZ	Society & Culture;Community Service	Can I help impoverished people abroad?	So I have always wanted to help people and I have looked into trying to help impoverished people in poor countries. I would prefer something temporary (not more than a year) and maybe in like Bangladesh or Peru or something. My only problem is that I would need to be paid, at least have my living/travel expenses while there paid for because I am still a student and once I graduate I won't exactly have the funds to fly around the world.   Most of the organizations I have looked at are either long term project types or require you to at least pay your own if not pay them also.   If anyone knows of a good website or organization that is worth looking into it would help guide me in the right direction. Thanks!

20090222101638AA0RsKG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the correct translation of John 1:1? God or a God?	a God or God? Note what the older Coptic Bible says.      John 1:1 "In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god". New World Translation      John 1:1 1 "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". New International Version      NOTE: The ancient Coptic translations of John 1:1 do not render it “the Word was God,” as is common in many English versions, but “the Word was a god,”, just as found in the New World Translation by Jehovah's Witnesses. The Coptic versions precede the New World Translation by some 1,700 years, and were produced at a time when the Koine Greek of the Christian Greek Scriptures was still a living language.

20090222163139AACCe52	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why does society confuse people with their race?	For example: Why do society call "black people" African-American when some of the black people never stepped foot in Africa? Why does society call black people "black" in the first place? Last I looked at myself, my skin is a brownish color. My skin isn't black like a crow.      Also, why does society call white people Caucasian? Not every white person came from Asia or any of the European countries. Also If a "Caucasian" person was white, their skin would be as white as snow. When I look at the skin color of a "white" person, it looks more of a light-peach color mixed with alittle light-red.      And just for the record, I am NOT a racist so get it out of your heads if you're thinking that.

20090222174131AAryjP4	Society & Culture;Languages	Why do I have this accent?	I am of Irish and Indian (native american, not from india) decent, though I do not look much like either. I live in New Hampshire and so I have an accent from that area, but at random times I will start talking in an english/british accent, and australian accent or a french accent involuntary, though I am not around nor hear anyone with these accents. As it is involuntary, I can't stop speaking in them, once I went 3 days with a british/english accent over the summer and my best friend was over and she laughed the whole time. (not in a mean way.) The only way I can at least temporarily stop speaking in random accents and mixtures of them is if I speak very slowly and in monotone, which is hard for me. Its not that I don't like this happening (speaking in random accents and mixes of them) but I was just wondering if anyone has any idea why.

I was beaten into a forced conversion ( saying that I gave my life to Jesus) over 30+ years ago at the age of 15 or so.  I am now after all those years a Wiccan Witch and suffered much for what I went through years ago emotionally and spiritually after being forced into a path that wasn't my own.  I am now on my path and am doing well.  But I decided to try and find some of the other girls (they only did this to girls) that went through something similar during the time period I did.  I found 5 others.. I am sure there were more but I just  found 5.      Two have gone on to be atheists.   One stayed in the fundy group, weighs like 360 pounds and goes door to door harrasing people for Jesus.  She gave her kids over to the group's teachings...( the two kids.. one is a drug user and in and out of detox and the girl was a momma at age 14 and now at age 20 she has six kids so far by an elder of the group).   The other two of the 5 are dead.. both by suicide (one ten years ago and the other just three years ago).   I am the only one who turned to Wicca and witchcraft.      Your opinions?
20090222113007AASB7mx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does Christianity go against the concepts of the bible?	In the gospel of Matthew Chapter 12 Verse 38-40 Jesus clearly says: That he is not the Son of God    'Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master we would see a sign from thee. 39 Who answering said to them: An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet. 40 For as Jonas was in the whale's belly three days and three nights: so shall the SON OF MAN be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.'      Here he clearly says he is not the Son of God   So why is christianity moving away from the teachings of the bible?      I anticipate that people will come here and start quoting the bible verses where Jesus said i nthe bible he is but why is the quote i mentioned in the Bible?      Why is it the bible contradicts itself in many verses to the actual belief of christianity?
20090222101432AAFPsZH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do so many Christians say the Bible foretells historic events but reject any event you bring up?	I know it's not all but a HUGE amount of Christians I know constantly say that the bible can be used to predict current events but can never really seem to pin point any event to a passage in the bible.      If the bible is a prophecy of what's to come or what has happened then you have to be able to match history, current events etc with some sort of biblical text. So which one is it? Either it does or it doesn't and if it does which events match which passages?
20090222121631AAoQtH2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do so many people think Children are not educated about Sex?	Not one teen will say..I don't know about safe sex THEY ALL DO..Sex is shoved in there face daily..But as all TEENS DO..THEY DO NOT LISTEN they still drive and drink they still have unprotected sex and they still act irresposnible because so many of today's family are TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE....      Isn't the failure of SOCIETY to teens and the future generation the LACK of Morality as a WHOLE???      You can tell a Kid over and over and over again..Do not smoke Pot, Use a Condom when you have sex, do not drive drunk BUT it has FAILED Misreably because SOCIETY does the Opposite of what they tell kids to do, so why would any Kid Listen?      Kids today hardly listen to there parents, yet they are going to heed the advice from teachers saying *Use A Condom*?? if that is the case why are Abortions going up, up and up?      How can you teach Kids to be responsible and moral?l when Society isn't?'      My son went to religious school, not one kid girl was ever preganant    Safe Sex was not taught but NO sex before marriage was, there was no metal detectors no kids using drugs and no the Kids were not perfect but  they were a 100% better off than the children have in the public secular school system.      What is the reason Society is failing the next generation in every aspect of life?
20090222122853AAb4XEu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why can't people convert to Orthodox Judaism if they felt it was the right religion?	I was studying Judaism at school last year, and wondered this. Apparently if you want to convert to Judaism you have to convert to Reformed Judaism. But what if you felt Orthodox methods were better??    Wouldn't God want us all to choose the right path? I think its unfair that you have to be born into Judaism to be part of the religion. We can't choose what religion we are born into after all the same way we don't choose to be born !

20090222112438AAHxdLx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why don't Christians obey what is written in their book of Matthew and show love to their enemies?	And I quote: "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your friends, hate your enemies.'  But now I tell you: love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you will become children of your father in heaven.  For he makes his sun to shine on bad and good people alike and gives rain to those who do good and to those who do evil.  Why should god reward you if you love only the people who love you?  Even the tax collectors do that!  And if you speak only to your friends, have you done anything out of the ordinary?  Even the pagans do that!  You must be perfect - just as your father in heaven is perfect." (Matthew 5:43-48).      When you consider the answers given by Christians on Yahoo Answers to people who speak out against Christianity, it is a far cry from showing love.  Aren't Christians meant to obey what is written in their own doctrine and practice what they preach?  Aren't Christians to love us regardless of what we say?  Aren't Christians to strive to be perfect like their triad god?  Apparently not.  The vitriol they tap into their keyboard is borne out of pure hate.  Present sound scriptural evidence before them that dismisses their warped beliefs and they  pretend to be as blind as bats and as stubborn as mules.  Perfection it seems is beyond their reach.

20090222171052AAt9pjQ	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do I handle this my mother treating me like a child...?	and being mean to me? She is especially mean to me when my Grandmother is around; they gang up on me. (The wierd thing she is her mother in law). And I DONT want lectures on respecting my elders, so if that is how you want to help don't bother. I am 29 and whenever I come over the house for Sunday night supper, they boss me around. When I help clean the table, they just sit there and boss me; like "take more plates at a time." They will say stuff like, "We want to teach you how to do it! If I make a smart remark  (not to be disrespecful, just to express annoyance) I say things like, thank God I have you to teach me how to carry plates, they jump all over me and say things like, "You're too senisitive!" THey are the ones too sensive, they are making a whole discussion over what I said. And when I make conversation, my mom shushes me like she does not want me to talk too much or loud! Or she will say, "Eat your food before it gets COLD!" I AM 29 years old for gosh sakes! And it isn't just to treating me like a child, but just the mean behavior. She made me stay at the house while she was away which I was cool with but she told me I could bring my fiance, but when he was still there the night she arrived, she got mad that he didn't leave right away; he was just getting his things together! She screamed at me that the kitchen is dirty when it was not. And she always says nasty negative things to me! When I try to express my feelings, she just yells at me!

I see some girl asking a question about why her boyfriend dumped her and there are like 70 responses and then I see the homework questions and there are 0-1 responses.   So, what are the criteria for good questions?

20090222191312AAeJ4hs	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Anyone know what this dream could mean?	in this dream...i was at a bar and the only other person there was the bartender. he was pacing back and forth behind the bar with his hand to his face as though he had a bad tooth ache. i tried to tell him to look for some powdered clove to ease his pain, but he just ignored me.   until i began to wake up from the dream. as i began to fade out of the dream, he turned and watched me fade out of the dream.      i've never faded out of a dream before, i've always just woke up and i've never had anyone in the dream watch me wake up.   does this mean anything?
20090222183831AARN9mE	Society & Culture;Languages	I have a few questions, I'm beginning to learn Japanese?	Okay, first of all when your declaring a sentence, and your supposed to say, for example,    魚だ - Is fish.   How do I pronounce the character だ? I can't find out how.   Also, when talking about a negative state of being, and you say,   静かじゃない - Is not quiet   Does the じゃない become pronounced as jyanai?    So does that mean for 静かじゃない you say Shizuka jyanai?    I've heard some people say something like Shizuka jyanai de... Like, pronounciation: -adjective- jeenai day. So I assume its that.So can someone explain? Arigatouu~

20090222185023AAuMIHs	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	HELP! MY BOYFRIEND IS SOOO IGNORANT..PLEASE READ!! =/?	Okay, so I'm writing a ten "Cutters" and the topic is trying to prove that they don't do it for attention, I myself am a cutter although I have not cut since January, and we always have these really heated arguments with each of us trying to prove our point. I tell him that he can't speak for us or just me when he says that there are other ways of releasing emotions or whatever, unless he has gone through it and known what it's like. It hurts me so bad to know that instead of helping me, he judges me and thinks I only do it for attention, and that the time I "tried  to kill myself" was also nothing but me seeking attention. He says that if I had really wanted to die, I would find a way instead of failing to do it. Please help..how can I change his point of view, point me in the right direction, doctors who have done studies on these things, real solid facts that he just can't dismiss. Please, I'm desperate for him to understand that it is not for attention. His remarks about it hurt me so bad, I feel that he belittles me. HELP!! =/
