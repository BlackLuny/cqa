AA12139345	The biggest difference is capacity.  The full size units he has will do more clothes at one time.  Stacked units take up less floor space, but they can only handle smaller loads at one time.  <br>  <br>  Which is 'best' is different depending on how much laundry you need to do, and how often.  For example, if you're the type who prefers to wait and do all the laundry on one day, the full size units would probably work better.  If you're accustomed to doing small loads every day, then the stacked units would work fine.  Families larger than a 'couple', would not be able to get all of their laundry done with just a small stacked unit.  It could be problematic too, if either of you work in an environment that causes you to get your work clothes really dirty, every day.<br>  <br>  So, the big question, is how often do you want to do laundry?   Every day?  Or just one or two days a week?<br>  <br>  Have Fun

oDgnXJB8aa	Listen you can get the four prong plug at a hardware store, at Lowes or Home depot, and then maybe some one can put it on for you. It's simple really, just have the main power shut off (breaker) and take the three one off and replace it with the four one. <br>  I had to have this done with my stove.  hope this helps|`|asPaydBRaa	here is all the info you need<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufaSGm-bzBQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufaSGm-bz...</a>|`|pkggMaOQaa	you could also try finding an Adapter try home depot or Lowe's ask an electrician specialist there|`|PQJyaFDXaa	We've had to solve this problem before.  We found the answer at the link below.<br>  <br>  Either get a converter, change the cord, or update the electrical system.  The converter is the easiest and cheapest solution, but we were more comfortable with changing the cord to a 3 prong (it's pretty easy, and the linked site has step-by-step instructions.)  Rewiring a new outlet will take an electrician.  Not sure how much since we didn't go that way, but we were sure it was going to be more than just getting a cord or converter.|`|AA12139345	You've got two ways of correcting this... change the cord on the dryer, or change the plug.  One is going to cost about as much as the other.  And yes, you can purchase, or make, heavy duty extensions for dryers.<br>  <br>  With a 4 prong wire, you have the two 'hot wires', the neutral, and a ground.  On a 3 plug, its just the 2 'hots', and the neutral.<br>  <br>  Here are some links for you - <br>  <a href="http://homerenovations.about.com/od/electrical/a/artdryeroutlet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://homerenovations.about.com/od/elec...</a><br>  This link has some good pics of the back of the dryer, and the 2 versions of dryer outlet -<br>  <a href="http://fixitnow.com/appliantology/dryercords.htm" rel="nofollow">http://fixitnow.com/appliantology/dryerc...</a><br>  <br>  It would be best to bring the outlet up to code.  That means changing it from a 3 prong outlet, to a 4 prong outlet (with the ground).  If the old outlet was wired without a ground... I would STRONGLY suggest that you run a new circuit.  Call in an electrician to have it done right, if you're not familiar with electrical work.  All of the parts can be bought from the local hardware, or building supply store.  You'd want a new breaker, enough wire to run from the circuit panel to where you want to put the dryer, and the outlet itself.  The wire has to be secured somehow.. that means either running it through conduit, or using wire fasteners, aka 'staples' to secure the wire.  The outlet should be secured to the wall  (in a basement, I would put it just above the top of the dryer)<br>  <br>  I would start at the outlet... connect the wires to the appropriate terminals in the outlet, and secure it to the wall.  Then run the wire to the circuit panel, securing it as you go.  Once at the circuit panel, shut off the main breaker, remove the cover, and feed the wire into the box.  Install the new breaker (I'd replace the old one just on principle), connect the wires, replace the cover, and turn the main back on.  You're all set.  (I'd have disconnected the old 3 prong outlet circuit in the process)<br>  <br>  A typical install of a new circuit like this would take maybe a half hour, by someone who's had some practice at it, hehehe.<br>  Since this is your friends dryer.. and it seems you've not had any experience running circuits, I would, again, recommend that you use a licensed electrician.  That way you KNOW it would be done properly, and there could be no accusations later, that a faulty install somehow damaged the dryer.<br>  <br>  One more possible complication -- in some parts of the country, you must pull a permit, to run any new circuits, and have it inpsected.  This usually means you would be required to use a licensed electrician.  A quick phone call to your county/municipal office, or an electrician, will tell you if this is the case where you live.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

WiCfszv9aa	All good answers but there is a little known secret. First clean the fence as best you can, I would recommend a pressure washer, then find a product called Ospho, it is a metal treatment that turns rust back into metal. You can spray it on with a garden sprayer. After it is dry, paint your fence with any outdoor paint of your choice. No more rust!!|`|evItC2KQaa	use a wire wheel on a drill or grinder to remove the flaking paint and remove the surface rust. Then apply a rustoleum type paint. |`|oDgnXJB8aa	You could take a wire brush and clean it as much as you can. When you do paint it, try just to put a thin layer on first, let it dry and then add the second coat, this paint should be a paint that is for this type of material. Even using a primer first would be a good idea. <br>  hope this helps|`|c7b714cc6da879f29df0aeb5b52bafafaa	Sand and wire brush all loose paint and rust from fence.  There is a product called Rustoleum that is like a primer/top coat. You get two birds with one stone. It fights off rust and comes in a variety of colors. Happy sanding...|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Your going to have to sand it down before you paint, and even have to prime it.  Then find an outdoor paint that can handle the weather conditions.
mwDuaWTFaa	Typically sewer systems are tested for this type of problem using a smoke test.  Smoke is injected at key points into the sewage system.  The smoke will exit through any connection that does not have a proper trap.  Someone drives around looking for smoke coming from improper connections.  If your gutter drains are connected, they will usually be detected in this way.<br>  <br>  Your sump line will not have a trap.  Even if it did, you would have to figure out how to keep water in it for it to be effective.  It should have a check valve, which should keep the smoke out just as well, so you probably would not get caught.<br>  <br>  If there are severe problems in your area, the utility may want to do some more comprehensive inspections to minimize excessive inflow -- your sump would qualify.  In this case, they would issue a notice that they want to inspect your plumbing and make some kind of arrangements to gain access.  If you do not comply within a certain period of time, they would have the right to discontinue your service.  This usually means you water would be shut off, but in an extreme case they could disconnect or block your sewage line.  This is not a normal situation, but it does happen from time to time.<br>  <br>  A sump pump connected to a sewage system can cause more problems that it solves.  If there is flooding, the sewage system may become overloaded as well.  The overflow can run back through the pipes and into your sump pit, filling the basement with nasty stuff instead of just ground water.  A check valve should stop it, but they do fail from time to time.  Usually not worth the risk.  Best to install the pump with a discharge outlet near a storm drain or natural drainage.|`|OfPQVR1Naa	Wow, that's quite an answer the other dude gave.<br>  <br>  Where you are going to have a problem is when you go to sell your house or change insurance companies.  This is the only time a residence is going to be inspected.<br>  <br>  But, seriously, putting in a sump line is no big deal.  1/2" pvc can be used and most people just run their basement sumps out to the street.  If this isn't an option, you can always create a leech line (dig a trench, drop your pipe in it with holes in the pipe, fill with rocks and cover with dirt).  <br>  <br>  The other dude is right about one thing, though... there's a reason connecting your sump to the sewer isn't allowed.  It can cause problems down the road (do you really want a pump applying pressure to your sewer line if your sewer line becomes clogged?  Where do you think it's going to back-up into if this happens?).  The money you save now won't mean diddly when you come home to find sewage coming out of your drains because the sump pump is pushing it back up a clogged line....
l9xnybUMaa	Sorry to say that there is no way to reupholster leather without costing more than the purchase.<br>  If the leather is distressed but intact without rips, look into a leather repair service.  You can also restuff the cushions and get new foam and fill the seats yourself,  often the foam breaks down first, which makes it look deflated.  Hope this helps.  I know leather is a big investment, the new styles are casual and scuffed on purpose. embrace this trend!
AA12139345	As Andy B stated, the thing to consider is what is the car seat fabric made of?  <br>  <br>  Most t-shirts are cotton, or a cotton/polyester blend, and they have a decent thread count.  Some car seat covers are made out of synthetic materials, which could melt from the iron (or have a foam backer on them which could melt), or they are made of such a coarse fabric, the 'weave' would be too open for a transfer to stick well.  So, check the label on the car seat cover, and see what it is made of, and if there are any warnings about how to care for it.   If it says do not use a dryer after washing it, I wouldn't try to use an iron-on transfer, directly onto it.<br>  <br>  You could though, iron on the transfer to a piece of cotton material, and then sew that material onto the car seat cover.  This would even give you some artistic leeway, as you could put the iron on transfer onto a different colored piece of material, if you wanted to.<br>  <br>  Have Fun|`|LQJtisaIaa	it should work, depends on what type of fabric it is. the problem is not the transfer i would worry about the fabric burning or melting . check the label and see if it says you can use an  iron. if it says yes then go ahead and use the transfer..

And while for the most part that's a bad thing, it does give you some unique challenges and a chance to use your creativity. Remember to keep the walls LIGHT! When I was very young I painted the walls bright yellow. Not only did it blind you, it made the room seem even tinier. When I was 10 they were a light lilac colour. It was still too dark. If you are dead set against off white walls, get paint that has just a hint of colour in it. <br>  <br>  The good news is you can use pretty much anything for the accent colours (that's to say, the colour for the lamps, pillows, bedding, etc.). I would recommend against black though, as too much black will make it so you might as well have painted the walls black. Incorporate some of your favorite colours as it will make the room seem much more "you." A good rule to follow is USE colour, but no more than three, and USE neutrals, but no more then two. All neutrals will make it dull, all colours will make it too much. Sense I don't know your favorite colours I can't suggest a scheme, but good luck and I'm sure you'll find just the right one!|`|F5xVDvsAaa	My room has a hot pink feature wall and the others are yellow i love it but tht me rofl some ppl mite be loik ew but they look really good together!|`|psmJInNRaa	My favorite is a minty greenish blue with chocolate brown accents|`|HKDrdpNHaa	mirror on full wall makes the room look double...

These look like a rayon blend fabric with a soft hand, and they are probably at least two to three times the width of the window.  I cant tell if they are shirred onto a rod or onto a heading, but once you get the right book you will get your answers. These are custom window treatments and quite beautiful,  I hope this helps

I have one son that couldn't care less how his room is decorated and another who wants it just the way he wants it.It's  lime neon green, except for one wall that he painted himself some abstract thing,  pics on every wall, complete mess but like he's told me enough times IT'S HIS ROOM!|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	A lot of teenagers I know are using cork board on one wall.

If you then choose something you're both happy with, the less effort it will seem to be. <br>  <br>     In terms of furniture go for the basics first- a good bed, a bedside cabinet, bookcase/CD rack, computer desk/study desk are all good starters. Go for a metal or wooden set of furniture if you can, as this means it will last longer and look better. Pine is popular. <br>    Pictures- he'll probably have posters to put up anyway. Maybe take some of them, or some film posters, and frame them. Go to a hardware store and get clip-frames if you don't want to spend too much. <br>  <br>     As for colors, you want something bearable and light. A blue color is always good, or a creamy color if you think he'll like that. <br>  <br>   Otherwise it's a case of looking through catalogues and paint charts and finding what you want.|`|jwLfrIy0aa	PB teen : great place for him to find what he likes and Urban Outfitters has a lot of cool stuff too.

Standing on a stepladder, carefully scrub the affected areas. <br>  Step3. Fill the bucket with fresh water. Using the scrubber sponge, rinse thoroughly. <br>   Do not use straight bleach. When cleaning the ceiling, open the window to help with the chlorine fumes. This formula will kill the mildew spores.<br>  <br>  You are correct about the mildew appearing to be in the caulk.

There is one room beside the office with a connecting door. All we put up on it was a thick piece of foam. It works well but sometimes we still hear a few things.
3sU90myfaa	I am a 37 year experienced painter and prefer Sherwin Williams paint, but it isn't real cheap...if doing a project that you are on a tight budget, I suggest going to walmart and purchasing a paint there that the brand is "color time" or "color place"..I forget exactly but it is thier only label with the "color" as the first part of it...I have used it alot on houses with people on a budget, and it is actually manufactured by Sherwin Williams exclusively for wal mart...Color Place..I believe is the label name..they have it in interior and exterior and different sheens(gloss levels) as you would want..I have painted houses that are still in good shape with it after 7 or 8 years and not peeling or fading..it is at a good price|`|FXnHE7mmaa	I don't know where you live but here I like Beauti Tone by Home Hardware.

83b9c11562d344b8e4284f71b30ebb2caa	If you keep most of your plants potted it will allow you to move them with, as you move homes, and you could eventually plant them in the ground, if you have somewhere that's more permanent.<br>  <br>  You can make mini-ponds from many containers, including tubs that have no drainage holes, the depth of the water will dictate what you can grow, with 2 - 3 feet in depth or more allowing you to grow water lilies: some of them are 'pygmy',  dwarfer types, that are able to grow in shallower water.   <br>  <br>  Choose plants according to your location, including how much sun you get, including water lillies which require as much sun as possible, in order to flower well.  <br>  <br>  As you've got a small area, aim to use as much vertical space as possible,  as this will create the feeling of a larger space,  as well as give you more leaves and flowers or produce, for the available room.  Climbers are good for this, and could be grown over very temporary structures, including some garden wire,  or over trellis structures etc.    I'd recommend some fragrance too, as this will be easy to smell in a smaller garden, and make it much more enjoyable to be outside.  Fragrant climbers include Honeysuckles, which come in a range of varieties, most of them with really sweet fragrance.  Container growing will help contain the size of some of your plants,  and I had 2 smallish honeysuckles, for example, for a few years on an appartment balcony, that are now huge fence clinging cimbers in my permanent garden, 20 years later.  <br>  <br>  Aim to get a mix of foliage types as well as flower and leaf colours in your garden, which will add interest, as well as plants that bloom at different periods.  Some herbs are decorative, including sages, Rosemary, and Lavenders are beautiful, even though we don't generally use them as herbs.  <br>  <br>  To keep costs to a minimum, you could mix soil from a friend's garden, with purchased potting soil,  and possibly beg some cuttings of their plants too, which should rapidly establish, especially if they are already rooted divisions of plants, rather than stem cuttings with no roots, which require a bit more care and patience.  <br>  <br>  Finally, consider some slower growing plants that are better value when small, but cost a lot more when they're larger, such as some of the palms, which can be frost hardy, depending on variety.  These are good longer term investments for you, that needn't cost much now, but will still give your garden variety.<br>  <br>  The cheapest method, other than begging some free cuttings and plants off friends, is to grow plants from seed,  where you can get dozens or hundreds of plants from a small packet, costing very little.  Some of them are annuals, which will grow and flower the first year, and then die,  others are longer lasting.  These could be started indoors, or else sown where they are to grow.  Choose a mix of colours etc, as earlier, for best effect.<br>  <br>  Mosquitoes can be prevented through having moving water, or else you can use a low-cost controller, such as Mosquito Dunks, which places like Home Depot etc sell.  These prevent any eggs laid from becoming adult biting insects.   See here for an example: <a href="http://byardhealth.stores.yahoo.net/mosquitodunks.html" rel="nofollow">http://byardhealth.stores.yahoo.net/mosq...</a><br>  <br>  Let me know if you any questions, or would like other ideas.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

AA12139345	Sounds as if you have a heat pump system.  If this is the case, then it means that under normal conditions, the system can provide enough heat through the normal working of the heat pump (or geothermal pump).  But if it gets too cold, then it has to actually turn on some heating elements, and the system lets you know when, by flashing that 'Aux Heat' - which stands for Auxiliary Heat.  The more often the Auxiliary heat has to run, the higher your utility bill will be.  Its the way the system is designed to run, and it is working properly - you're just not enjoying the savings you could be, when the 'aux heat' kicks in.<br>  <br>  Have Fun

cuIX13BKaa	I have had a lifetime to think about this and yes...ultimately I think that to take the source of life away fro something as small...yes even as small as an ant or a bug is cruel...not that I have not had my share of fly swatting.....  but after the youthful fascination of watching them driven by instinct.....we ar NOT going to change their place here on earth in the 'food chain' of life. Instinct is an amazing this. If you watch them carefully enough you will see patterns depending upon what kinds of bugs they are. I see no reason, except to grandstand and be a bully to kill ants. There is no record that i am aware of indicating just how they feel from any of a number of scientific tests....just they have this 'compelling need' beyond what even w can imagine to 'work, build and so forth' their entire lives ~ These days i take a bit more care as my love of all life has increased.....I treat others ...all others as I would want to be treated...and the effect is reciprocal.<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I leave them go when I can as they are living creatures, but kill them if you have to it depends on the situation because that is nature.

AKrTZqbKaa	Water usually drains back into the sump pump after it shuts off unless someone added a flow control valve in the pipe which is usually done on long pipes lines. This keeps water in the pipe and possibly in an area that is cold and freezing. You could measure the pipes length and buy a heat tape to keep them from freezing or add a little more heat to exposed pipes in the basement. Don't insulate over a heat tape as this causes the tape to heat up and burn out. Use insulation or a heat tape not both. What State do you live in?. We shouldn't get too many more days of real cold weather causing the pipes to freeze. Unless the pipes are close to the outside environment. They should be thawed before the spring thaw arrives.|`|fyWGMB9caa	your sump pump line must be pitched outward so water doesn't lay in the  pipe and freeze . you can only try to thaw out the pipes manually at this point.try and hair dryer or heat gun .|`|ainoGoFraa	Disconnect the lines, thaw them out and verify the pump still works to keep your basement dry.

Y0ffbZKraa	Welcome to the club!<br>  <br>  The only way to reduce clutter is to get rid of it. I can help you with that, and with the organizing of what's left. Let me warn you now though: this is a serious project and is going to take up a lot of time. I would suggest working 15 minutes to an hour every day, and more on the weekends if you can spare it. Sense you have so much stuff you'll need to start with just one thing. Say, books, or jewelry. You'll gather ALL of those pieces and put them in a pile on the floor or your bed. Then go through every single piece and ask yourself: Do I even like this? When was the last time I wore/read/watched/listened to this? Do I plan to in the near future? And separate the pieces into three piles<br>  1: Keep<br>  2: Trash<br>  3: Give away<br>  Pile 2 is for makeup, hair things, lotions, undergarments, and anything broken or stained. Pile 3 is for books, clothing, jewelry, etc. that is in good condition.<br>  Once it's all separated pitch the trash, set the Give Away pile somewhere out of the way (you don't want to make 400 trips to the thrift store, do you?) And put the keep pile away. For the moment it's okay if they're stacked in a corner or whatever sense you haven't got storage worked out. You'll have to repeat this process with every single thing in your room.<br>  <br>  Now that the things cluttering your space are all things you actually want, it's time for storage and organization. If you only have a three drawer dresser you'll need to pack away all your off season clothing. A seperate room would be best, but a storage container under the bed will work too. You can get them at Target for about $15. Your dresser must be pretty short. Could you put a small bookcase on top of it? If not, or if that's not, and you can't fit a tall bookcase in your room put sheleves on the walls. They will run you anywhere from $10 to $45, depending on how fancy you want them and where you buy them. If you or someone you know is good with building things, making the shelves might be a better option. Something people miss a lot though is that shelves don't have to be white and in a straight line across the wall. You can easily spray paint shelves any colour you want, and you can hang them in designs or patterns as long as you make sure they're level. Hang them in a circle if you'd like! Another thing people miss is that shelves don't have to hold only books. They're also great for movies, CDs, notebooks, knick knacks, clocks, music players, and even gaming systems. The basic rule of rooms: If you can't build out - build up. For hair and art supplies I would suggest something like this <br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Sterilite-7-Drawer-Craft-Cart-White/dp/B000MQ62IG/ref=sc_ri_3?ie=UTF8&pf_rd_r=1C6H2Z4Z4R4EXQNCEW76&pf_rd_p=465348991&pf_rd_i=B0006O0EE2&pf_rd_s=bottom-11&pf_rd_m=A1VC38T7YXB528&pf_rd_t=201" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Sterilite-7-Drawer...</a><br>  You can get ones with more or less drawers and for different prices at different stores. Just keep your eyes out. This is a great place for them because you can get them without wheeles (or sometimes leave the wheeles off, it depends what one you get) and stack them. Most of them are less than two feet wide so you don't have to sacrafice much space. For makeup you may want to invest in an actual makeup case, or you can use another plastic storage unit like above. Jewelry is best kept in a jewelry box. Why not make one? Or if you aren't good with wood working pick a plain wood box up from the craft store ($5-$10) and decorate it any way you like. <br>  <br>  Without more detail about the size of your room and what type of clutter you have that's the most help I can be. Sorry, hope it helps!|`|ZDxN0g7Faa	if you have a big wall space in your room, you could have multiple shelves... but make them look like grids... and put your items where you can see them and remember where you put them... if that's not the idea you're looking for, there's always getting more drawers (i think going for clear ones should be helpful), having a designated area for each type of item? like clothes here in one area, makeup on the desk or something, hair stuff in the bathroom... hope it helps!|`|l9xnybUMaa	Well material girl, <br>  Whatever you do make it fun, spend a weekend with a friend and play loud music and clear all your clutter, sort stuff into bags for trash, store, give away, belongs elssewhere... then stay in the room until its done.<br>  Next weekend, shop for an old used entertainment center, or armoire at a thrift store you must get more storage. Use your own style to design your storage, if youre casual get hooks, if youre tidy, get shelves.  Dont spend alot, you can paint furniture white or black and then add posters and its really happy and fun...see shopwildthings.com for finishing touches with sparkle and rockon!|`|hPgRvmTUaa	I have the same problem, but a different kind of clutter. I buy books whenever I see them selling cheap and interesting in charity shops. Its an addiction !

AA10132204	In the USA and EU,  the sewage is treated to government standards and the purified water is returned to a waterbody (lake, river, ocean).

AA10283947	What a let down this twerp is.<br>  Write him a letter, give him a date that YOU want him to FINISH the job by, be assertive and let him know that there is a risk of TYPHOID from open drains and the date set for completion is non-negotiable, any further delaying on his part will have you resorting to the local authorities and legal teams.|`|DBVJ7AIMaa	Speak to him and tell him he has 7 days to make good the piping before you report him to environmental services.<br>  Most local councils have a web site you can contact them on.

Since it will be a health hazard the council should get involved though. I would send him a letter saying that if he hasn't fixed it by a certain date then you will have it fixed and send him the bill but that might be better sent by a lawyer. Try the council first though. Very annoying when you were trying to be helpful to be left high and dry so to speak. You tried to be nice about it...time for the big guns now.|`|bFux98bVaa	Speak to the Citizens Advice Beaureau. (not sure about the spelling there).|`|oLz4jYXqaa	You can get some redress through the courts. Councils will not want to be involved. So it depends on whether you want to keep on good terms with your neighbour. Taking him to court may sour the relationship, but if you are beyond caring now, you may want to go that way. The other way is to keep badgering them until they relent. Play the distressed person, tearing your hair out because you cannot stand it any more, it's driving you nuts, Oh, please do something... That may do it and still maintain a modicum of peace later on.|`|w3KDePAeaa	I live in the US and own a small plumbing service company. He should be told sternly that if he doesn't fix the problem that he created that you will report him to whatever health bureau or organization that he should be held accountable to. And YES if he does not get on it within the time frame allotted then hold him accountable and report him to every authority that you can think of (even the police). It IS a serious health risk! Hepatitis is always lurking near open sewer! People tend to do a terrific job for a paying customer and then fail to give themselves, their spouse, their unpaying neighbor the same attention. He probably sees it in a way that it was "his" mess and he'll clean it up when he has time (when he isn't making money and is fully rested and feels like it)... Get my point? It will never happen unless you make the procrastinator fix the issue! Threaten him and if he won't budge call the authorities who will make him. He may be angry with you but you did not ask for the situation that he has placed you in. Hope you get it fixed.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Department of Health at your Local Authority!!

AA12218589	Hi Chrissy,<br>  <br>  I suppose you need to find out how quickly they fix the lifts. I live in a tower bloc and, usually, if one of the two lifts breaks down they fix them fairly quickly, but it is a pain if they are both down. If you have a disability then you should think carefully about whether this is a good idea. Also, take a look at how clean the public spaces are.<br>  <br>  Fire isn't any more of an issue, as long as you are reasonably mobile. All floors will have fire escapes. I haven't had any trouble with crime. I think it is more likely if you live in a house. <br>  <br>  Good points are:<br>  <br>  -it's usually much quieter up in the sky<br>  <br>  -the view, particularly on summer days, is stunning<br>  <br>  One final thought might be to sound out some of your potential neighbours and see what they say. If there are any issues, they are the people who wil tell you the truth.
wj8FNY7Vaa	You could use sand as a base and then place the blocks on the sand around the outside edge where you will be walking.   The most important thing about any base is that it be level and not subject to compaction from the weight of the hot tub.<br>  <br>  But I have one question, how are you going to get the hot tub into your back yard if you can't get a wheel barrow in?|`|IICFEIE0aa	I normally just use a gravel base on my installs unless the owner requests a pad. Here are a few options,<a href="http://www.spadepot.com/spacyclopedia/setup.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spadepot.com/spacyclopedia/se...</a>|`|5bdd86f6d407237731427858b6053c92aa	I think that it's overkill to use concrete for a pad.  I used stone dust for the base and added 1" thick bluestone blocks surrounding the tub for a patio-like look, but you could use whatever you want for patio surface.  Use about 4" of stone dust under both the tub and the patio surface.  Plan ahead and bury your power cord in the stone dust to come up just where it should be.  Make sure the stone dust is level before placing the tub, and add the patio blocks after the tub is in place.
IPALUs7qaa	I have 2 cats and never got any diseases from them. If you are just going to get a basic pet like a dog or a cat, they usually don't have diseases unless they are feral maybe?!

wj8FNY7Vaa	You should be able to go to any lumber yard or building supply and order or take home a replacement door.<br>  <br>  If you need the exact same manufacturer then you need to go to their web site and look for a local dealer.<br>  <br>  Most doors come in standard sizes.  You measure the door and then buy a "prehung" door of the same size.  If the door varies by an 1/8" or so it does not matter.  <br>  <br>  Most doors are 80" tall x 34" or 36" for exterior doors, occasionally they will be 32" or even 30".
