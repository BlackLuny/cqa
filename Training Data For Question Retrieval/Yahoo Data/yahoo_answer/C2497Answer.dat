Also at sea in the north sea and the atlantic .<br>  UK, France,Belgium [later USA against Germany.Also involved we Italy Russia and othe countries against Germany and Austria.

Countries around it including Germany decided to align against each other, but the United States did not get involved in the war yet through isolationst techniques from president Woodrow Wilson...the USA was only sending war supplies to the allies...England and France, at that point.<br>  <br>  But the Germans had some sneaky ideas to beckon Americans to fight in this war...ending this isolationism by the USA.<br>  <br>  Regrettably, the sinking of the USA Lusitania caused the United States to enter the war about 1 year later. You may have heard Wlison's quote..."The world [must be held] safe for democracy."<br>  Wilson also had an idea of the Selective Service law in WWI.<br>  <br>  Germany was the main enemy at that point. The USA's armed forces decided to go through establishing a Western front through German-held France and they (the Americans) just did it in time....since the Germans already took up Paris.<br>  <br>  Mechanized warfare was introduced in WWI. Poison gas was used, as well as the first machine guns, and tanks, and barbed wire and trenches. The airplane was also used for the first time in war.<br>  <br>  The war ended in 11/11/19 by an armistice between Germans and the Allied forces. The end of the war was almost like the end of the Korean War in the 1950s.

Make sure the nose is shaded smoothly and doesn't have hard lines because as you probably know, the nose is formed by shadows. I think the thing that makes a picture look original are the eyes. So make sure you shade the eyes correctly, and have the bags it's supposed to have. If you need more help, you could go on YouTube and search "How to shade eyes". You probably are satisfied with your shading cuz you stated it, but yeah. Doesn't hurt to check ^^|`|JKml2p9gaa	first of all when you start to get frustrated. Walk away.  Leave it for awhile.  I am assuming that you have a picture to use for the drawing.  make sure porportion is correct.  mouths and eyes are tricky.  Just take your time and really focus on the area you are drawing.  If you still are having difficulty, practice on another piece of paper only the eyes and mouth, until you get the feel of it. If you are using graphite, don't press too hard, and make sure you use a "magic rub" white eraser, they are wonderful!
fxPzrDU4aa	The beautiful thing about books is the fact that once you are reading them, it's YOUR moment, YOUR reading the only thing that matters. Reading a book is a lot more personal than what non-readers think.<br>  <br>  Nobody ever feels the same about a history or a book just like no one's life is the same.

When I read about Beowulf and Lord of the Rings and Animal Farm way back when people thought I was weird, Then they became pop culture icons and every one was doing it.  They understood and there for it wasn't weird. <br>  <br>  Rape and Suicide will never be a huge pop-culture thing though so people who don't seek out the knowledge of how or why or try to understand those situations will always see it as weird.

On the other hand, if the people who were calling you wierd didn't know the back-story, they might not get why you're interested in that type of reading material.|`|cgz85foTaa	It's stupid for them to act weird simply over the books that you read.

TNE6uFkTaa	This is a long subject which I will try to make short for you. During the early Middle ages in the West the only people who could read or write basically were monks/priests. The church was the cement that held the entire Medieval society together. In order to have a educated clergy the monasteries started what are called monastic schools and the the large cathedrals would have what became known as cathedral schools. The clergy were taught there and also nobles and the children of nobles. These schools waxed and waned in importance<br>  from 500 A.D. onward. However, in the 12th century came a momenteous event that was to change the West and education there forever. The translation of Aristotle's writings from Arabic into Latin.<br>  You see when the Greek Empire collapsed basically all of the Greek writers works were lost to the West. However the Arabic world had kept this information alive by translating it into Arabic or just having the texts in the Greek language. In the 12th century Spain became a crossroads were people from Europe translating Arabic texts into Latin. This is how Aristotle's works came to Europe. It was like a bombshell hit the educated classes when they read his texts. They needed to find a way to blend their Christian beliefs with his scientific and philosophical writings. In Paris students (who were monks, priest again)started to gather to study with certain teachers or masters so they could learn how to deal with the new knowledge. Gradually these classes joined into a formal school which became the University of Paris which is considered to the be first university. Although arguments can be made for an earlier university type school in the Arabic world. This university led to the establishment of others in London UK such as Oxford and Cambridge, In Italy such as Bologna<br>  etc.  A liberal arts curriculum was the ONLY curriculum you could study.Once you got your B.A. you could go on to specialize in law, medicine or theology but again the students were all monks, friars,<br>  priests.There were very few lay people as students. That is people who were not part of the church. You taught, wrote texts, practiced law,<br>  medicine or preached that is what you did with your education.<br>  <br>  Gothic cathedrals were huge soaring buildings and were  meant to impress the faithful with the power, the might and the strength of both God and the church. Years, decades, centuries were spent in their<br>  construction. The finest workers were used and they truly believed that they were working on a masterpiece that was being built for the sole glory of God.

How she gets the power is completely dependent on the type of story you are writing. Is it Sci-fi? Maybe it's genetic--evolution, or tampering by her parents and/or scientists. Is it fantasy? Maybe she's just a magical being.<br>  <br>  What I find easiest about the fantasy genre is that SOMETIMES the reader will just accept the points of your story (so long as they are small and not too distracting as plot holes). Magic is magic... especially if you are creating the world.<br>  <br>  2. Superpowers. You can never go wrong with the elements: fire, water, wind, earth, electricity, metal. Choose an element and do some research, to figure out what all that would entail.<br>  For example, water powers... that's not only liquid water, but vapor and ice. She can dehydrate at a glance, or be able to provide clean water out of the air on long camping trips. Or fire: that's not only flames, but heat (controlling the temperature).<br>  <br>  Go crazy.<br>  <br>  And if you don't want elements, I suggest looking through some Magical Girl Animes or Superhero comics on Wikipedia. Goodness knows Pokemon has MANY different types of powers to start with. <br>  The magical girl genre is very popular in Japan. Check out CardCaptor Sakura, or Cardcaptorz in the US. The main character invoked the powers of 52 tarot cards.... that's a lot of potential.<br>  <br>  Finally, there's always the Superman type of powers: flying, super strength, X-ray vision...<br>  <br>  Good luck! If you ever finish this, I'd love to beta, or edit, for you.|`|qa1bKUzmaa	she should have the power to control water. I know that sounds lame, but think about it. Everytime she touches water, she is immediately energized. She can control it and lift it and throw it around if she wants. Also, she can breathe underwater, and her clothes don't get wet if she doesn't want them to.  She can go as far underwater as she wants, with no limit cuz of pressure.  She can also talk to, understand, and command marine life.<br>  <br>  And, you should reveal how she got the power, and you should have it happen during the book. But not all at once. <br>  For example, have her fall in a puddle or something and feel better after a long day at school and soccer practice (or something like that). Then have her accidentally control water to reach out and grab her school enemy or something.<br>  <br>  Just some ideas. Hope you like 'em.

Though many boys are attracted to her when she arrives, she falls in love with Edward Cullen, a mysterious boy she discovers to be a vampire. In an attempt to protect Bella from his dangerous lifestyle, Edward leaves her. Bella falls into a depression and is comforted by her friend, Jacob Black. She comes to love Jacob as well, though not as deeply as she loves Edward. She eventually marries Edward and, after a complicated pregnancy, she gives birth to their daughter Renesmee, then becomes a vampire at age 18. After Bella's transformation, she has the ability to shield her and others' minds from mental attacks.<br>  <br>  Kristen Stewart played Bella in the Twilight film.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edward Cullen<br>  Main article: Edward Cullen (Twilight)<br>  Edward Cullen (born Edward Anthony Masen) was born on June 20, 1901 in Chicago, Illinois, and is frozen in his 17-year-old body. While dying of the Spanish influenza, he was changed into a vampire by Dr. Carlisle Cullen after Edward's mother, Elizabeth, begged him to save Edward as her dying wish. Edward has the special ability to read minds, with the exception of Bella Swan's. He falls in love with Bella soon after she arrives in Forks. Edward knows that he could kill Bella easily, a fact that torments him so much that in New Moon he decides to leave Forks so he and his family won't be able to hurt her. He returns, however, because he realizes he cannot live without her. Edward marries Bella in Breaking Dawn and they have a child, Renesmee.<br>  <br>  Robert Pattinson played Edward Cullen in the Twilight film.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jacob Black<br>  Main article: Jacob Black<br>  Jacob Black is Bella's best friend. He is a Quileute Native American and a werewolf, later revealed to be a shape-shifter as he doesn't transform on the full moon. In Twilight, Jacob plays a minor role, being a forgotten childhood friend of Bella's. In an attempt to learn more about Cullens, Bella flirts with Jacob, and he tells her tribe legends about them being "the cold ones", or vampires. After Edward leaves Bella in New Moon, Bella spends much of her time with Jacob, trying to heal her broken heart and move on. Though at first only a friend, Jacob later falls in love with Bella. Although he spends most of his time in Eclipse trying to win Bella, in Breaking Dawn he imprints —an involuntary process in which a werewolf finds their soul mate— on Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee.<br>  <br>  Taylor Lautner played Jacob Black in the Twilight film.<br>  <br>  <br>  Carlisle Cullen<br>  Carlisle Cullen (also known as Stregoni Benefici[1]) is Esme's husband and Edward, Rosalie, Emmett, Alice, and Jasper's adoptive father. His first appearance was in Twilight and his physical age is 23. Carlisle is described to look like a model; he has blond hair, stands at 6 ft 2 in (1.9 m), and is slender but muscular. Carlisle theorizes that when a human is turned into a vampire, they will have an enhanced ability from their previous life. He believes he brought compassion from his human life. Carlisle has had centuries to perfect his medicinal talents, therefore making him an excellent doctor. Unlike most vampires, he is not at all tempted by the scent of human blood, due to the over 300 years he has spent holding back his temptations. Carlisle Cullen was the son of an Anglican pastor, born in 1640s London, England, during a time of religious upheaval. His father and other pastors hunted creatures such as witches, werewolves, and vampires, often mistaking humans for them. As his father grew older, Carlisle assumed his role. One night, he was attacked by a vampire and left to die on the streets. Knowing he would be rejected by society, he hid himself and silently endured the painful transformation, emerging as a vampire. Horrified by what he had become, he tried killing himself many different ways, but all failed due to his power. One night, unable to endure hunger any longer, he fed on some passing deer. Subsequently realizing he could avoid feeding on humans, he committed himself to resisting his blood lust and to becoming a doctor.<br>  <br>  For a short time, Carlisle lived with the Volturi, though he eventually left and traveled to the New World. While treating patients with the Spanish Influenza, he met an ill woman who begged him to save her dying son, Edward. Out of loneliness, Carlisle transformed Edward into a vampire, and Edward became his companion. Soon after, in 1921, Carlisle moved to Wisconsin where he treated Esme after her failed suicide attempt brought on by her infant son's death. Carlisle felt compelled to save her and transformed her into a vampire, subsequently falling in love with her, and later marrying her. Carlisle then transformed Rosalie Hale, a young woman nearly killed by her drunken fiancé and his friends in Rochester, New York, and le|`|frpCK0utaa	Do your own homework, seriously. just read the books.|`|2ZOOcAr5aa	If you like it so muhc, then READ IT YOURSELF, AND DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK!!!!

foXUn6xWaa	In my experience you want to do a song that is similar in style. Do some research. Look at shows that the director has done recently. DO NOT DO THESE. Directors will hold these to higher standards. Normally you don't want to do songs from a show as the director will try to envision you as the character who sings that song. If they don't like you in that part they may not cast you at all. (Note: If you are only trying for a specific part this may work.) For example: If you are trying out for Little mermaid sing something from Lion King. Hope this helps.|`|aXm6wS8paa	try both good luck =P|`|ToQEIFW4aa	You should probably prepare for both, but for the song not in the movie, you should go for something fresh and original.

Try it ,the consciousness is different,and for some reason it takes you out of self consciousness. Focus on yourself and the audience at the same time.Try it,if you can understand it ,you may find it to work perfectly.|`|Hx47O8llaa	Ok well don;t picture the audience in thee undies..doesn't work! you just keep staring at them!!!!<br>  <br>  Don'tt look at them at all...or just focus on the people in the front row.<br>  Also it might help if you look at an exit sign in the back.. <br>  <br>  Got anymore questions??

Also, when you're on stage, find your friends in the audience and watch them instead of strangers. Lastly, breath and relax. Don't spazz out. If you make a mistake on stage, ignore it. If you say you made a mistake, the audience would know. If you don't mention that, the audience might not even know you made a mistake. Hope that helps. :)|`|wprAxB6Jaa	the moment you are NOT nervous is the moment you shouldnt be on stage! just turn your nerves into something positive to FUEL your performance!!! also practice at home in front of the mirror so u can see how you should do all of your lines. and make sure you know them perfectly! that should help :) and listen to notes ur director gives you. but if ur not nervous then something is wrong! it means u shouldnt be acting. thats the great part about performing|`|ToQEIFW4aa	I used to have the same problem!!!<br>  <br>  Do not focus on them.

AA10731404	The Great War as it was called at the time is a watershed in history.  In the beginning all expected a short war (less than a year), but it developed in a long war of attrition because neither side was markedly stronger than the other.  <br>  <br>  It also transformed European society.  The "empires" fell (Russia, Turkey, Austria-Hungary, Germany) and entirely new governments arose in their places.

W1h3w5gdaa	Yes, the prices are negotiable. I know because I've negotiated prices there. The employees are largely paid on commission, so they have to have bargaining room in order to close sales.<br>  <br>  So haggle your heart out!! :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, gosh, you asked about percentage, sorry. Um, I don't really know; there is a limit to how low they can go, and they can't do anything about the taxes. Start with something ridiculous like 30% off, and work from there.|`|Dj78kyxfaa	Its strage to me that everyone is saying yes. Just a couple months ago I went to purchase a Martin acoustic and they weren't willing to bargain with me. They said that since their prices are the best, they can't negotiate anymore but they can meet prices from other companys. So I said...if I go to Lansing (another town) and they bargain with me, why would I come back here to get it then?<br>  <br>  He didn't really have an answer, so I left and went somewhere else. <br>  <br>  Best Buy is selling real musical instruments now, and they'll bargain. Maybe since every other store bargains, maybe they started doing it again.<br>  <br>  What I Usually do is say...yeah, I really want this...but 500 is a little steep. And they will usually offer up a deal. Thats what I did with my Tube amp at Best Buy, got a great deal.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped some.|`|mduUXUQtaa	Yeah they relay are espeaily if you know the guys who work there i get deals all the time|`|Ot06v8yvaa	Yes you can negotiate but sometimes some employes cant take customers who want to bargain.<br>  <br>  Start off with 30% off.<br>  <br>  Then you can try to bargain from there. <br>  Since these times are hard they are probably trying to make a quick sale.

She definitely wouldn't be able to go to practice, learn her lines, etc.  And you catch it from other people's spit, so you could say she was kissing the creepy guy at school.  Also, if she has mono, she would be out of the picture for most of your story and you wouldn't have to worry about developing her character.|`|P5K41vYbaa	Appendicitis
29e65776b2f6c37d443d5d802b0326c1aa	The plane crashes?<br>  <br>  Editing is very hard when you don't know the context. Here are my suggestions:<br>  <br>  Delay the plane. The character goes to get a drink, or something... Hijinks ensue! Is his bag going to get stolen? Will he get in trouble? What?<br>  <br>  Or, the plane comes, no problem. <br>  <br>  Have this character sit down in his/her plane seat, and, after the stewardesses' safety speech and the plane takes off, have him take in his surroundings. Who is sitting next to him? In front of him? Behind him? What kind of people is he going to be sharing this flight with?<br>  Perhaps there are some tourists. Businessmen, chatting into their phones, irritated that they have to put them away and looking eager to get on their laptops. Perhaps someone's returning home. Maybe the person nearby is reading the newspaper--have the character envy that decision. <br>  Is the character sitting at the window seat? Maybe he'll order his soda and plan to spend his trip looking out, watching the world go by beneath him as he travels (for the first time?)...<br>  <br>  Most of this is just filler, but it's all I can do when I don't know the situation. What is most important for the beginning of a story is to get a feel for the character. You've got a great inner-monologue, with the character wishing he could turn around in stay... continue that. What are his reasons for going? Where is he going? How does he feel about all this?<br>  <br>  As for grammar and spelling... I would add dialogue instead of "she asked once again if I was sure..." There's no voice in that! Does she ask worriedly, wringing her hands? Is her voice shaking? Is she smiling bravely for her kid?<br>  There are a few commas you're missing, and "starred" should be "stared." Run it through Microsoft Word, that should catch most of them.<br>  Otherwise, not bad. Keep writing.|`|cAauS5aqaa	You migh want to take out the overused description and use something different (the plane sliced through the sky-it' good, but I feel like I heard that before somewhere else) try and write bigger sentences and use better description but stay away from cliches. I actually don't want to give you any examples because I've been writing all day and I'm kinda burnt out. But keep writing and keep at it.|`|GNf3tmguaa	its really good. i don't think you should change anything. keep going, but don't feel rushed. take your time. when you think of something good, you'll know and then go from there. if worse comes to worse, start another story. make it similar, but change it around a bit. hope i helped you and good luck!|`|AA10906922	I like your story. You say "I was having some trouble writing it" actually that is a good thing it shows you are stretching your writing skills. Some things come easy in writing but the things that don't make us work harder and make our writing even stronger. <br>  <br>  Every writer has a voice and you have found yours. It is nice and conveys emotion and a great use of words. I'm interested in reading more. If you take this story further, here are some ideas you could think of using. Once you are on the plane and flying introduce a character who is like you, someone who is moving forward in life but has reservations, or introduce a character who is up in age and can give you advice that would be an interesting conversation, or maybe have a few different people, different ages, different cultures. An airplane ride is a community of people and if you introduce these people and your reactions to them and theirs to you it would be something new. A child or two would add a whole new dimension. <br>  <br>  Whatever you choose to do I don't think you have to worry your writing is good and you have no problem showing versus telling. Stick with your writing, you definitely have talent. Try picking a topic or genre that you haven't written before, it will help your writing. And never stop learning to write as we are always learning. Good luck from one writer to the next!|`|oSS94le7aa	that was really good. keep going

This is an example of dramatic irony as the reader knows that Dimmesdale and Hester are partners in sin, but the characters do not.<br>  I don't know if you know Hawthorne. But that way I remembered it for my AP English class as, we know it and they haven't figured it out yet.|`|OGAh1LF9aa	Dramatic irony is basically when the reader (or watcher, if it's TV) knows something that the character doesn't, and it causes that character to make a bad decision that would otherwise be fine.<br>  EX: A man unlocks his door.

qRx3ynKdaa	Obviously things happened in 5th/6th century Britain, but almost no history has survived from this place and time, so we know very little about what happened. The only extended work from this place and time is the writing of Gildas; see <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gildas-full.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gil...</a> . And there are bits of information in some contemporary chronicles. None of these mention Arthur.<br>  <br>  But Gildas hardly mentions any names, so that doesn’t prove anything. And the chronicle information is rather hit-and-miss as well as being very scanty.<br>  <br>  John Morris in “The Age of Arthur” attempted to put together all information on 5th/6th century Britain. But his book is now out-of-date, and is also criticized for being too credulous. Still, it is a magnificent work of its kind. A work may be wrong, but still valuable or entirely correct but trivial.<br>  <br>  However, honest historians cannot “drop him altogether” and more than they can drop Hengest altogether or drop Cerdic or drop Vortigern altogether because some scholars have shown that what evidence we have for them is problematical. The correct course is to set forth the evidence and show where the problems lie, either by restating everything again, or footnoting another work that does this.<br>  <br>  Most historians do this, and don’t spend much time on 5th/6th century Britain, not because it wasn't a very interesting time, but because sources that might tell us exactly what happened have not come down do us.<br>  <br>  See also N.J. Higham's “King Arthur: Myth-Making and History” for the opposite of Morris. Higham correctly indicates that we cannot know what really happened, but then attempts documentary analysis about what the authors were doing who were writing the documents. Frankly, this is something which can't be done. I've read enough writing by modern authors who have pointed out that all critics seem to have missed what the author thought he was doing.<br>  <br>  Higham compares Arthur in the “Historia Brittonum” to Joshua and St. Patrick to Moses, and says that the author was inventing to make his parallel work. But even if this were true, it tells us no more about the historicity of Arthur than about the historicity of St. Patrick. Yet it may not be true. This Moses/St. Patrick comparison is just as likely to be an artifact invented by Higham as anything intended by the author or compiler. Arthur’s twelve battles as given in the “Historia Brittonum” may be entirely fictional, almost entirely factual, mixed fact and fiction, battles mostly historically fought by other personages... or other possibilities.<br>  <br>  Obviously we can't trust the battle list as history, even though it might be almost entirely factual, because it also might not be very factual. But we can’t trust a modern writer who argues that if he were the author of the “Historia Brittonum” this would be his reasons for writing this way, therefore that must be why the original author wrote it this way.<br>  <br>  That’s not history either.<br>  <br>  But books on King Arthur sell. Norma Goodrich's books which are simply based on assuming that the medieval romances of Arthur combined with her own ideas are historical sell. More sober books on Arthur also sell. <br>  <br>  Graham Phillips apparently just invents a text called “La Folie Perceval” which he then cites in “The Search for the Grail” and “The Chalice of Magdalene”. <br>  <br>  These alone are reasons why a true historian might want to write yet another book on Arthur. Compare to the number of books that have been written to debunk the Priory of Sion nonsense. Eventually such debunkings work. Erich von D?nichen’s chariots of the gods nonsense has little following today. (But for every crank theory that is debunked, a new one arises.)|`|EMCKaSF7aa	I would say no.  There is no mention of him in the work of Gildas, who is the only author we have for the time which was around the 6th century.  He is first mentioned in a 9th century work.  The people of Tintagel, whose economy is based on the Arthur legend, would disagree with me and cite a "sewer cover" which had written on it Artogonu, descendant of Coll, had this made.  This find seems to date from either the 6th or 7th centuries and proves that Tintagel was not a monastic settlement as some previous scholars had supposed.  As Artogonu is similar to Arthur some say that he was the mythical king.<br>  <br>  this site has some really good info <br>  <a href="http://www.britannia.com/history/arthur/kaking.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannia.com/history/arthur/...</a>|`|e4320d40393740e3b9148136c56004baaa	King Arthur :<br>   <br>  Legendary British King , son of Uther Pendragon and Igraine, said to have lived in the 6th Century. He was born in Tintagel and buried in Glastonbury; Auther's court was at Camelot ( Winchester, according to Malory's Morte d'Arthur ).|`|7sFNyeOhaa	He was based on Count de st. Germain.|`|n60icb3oaa	The thing about King Arthur is that his stories are great.  Think of it this way, if you named a hero Jane and said that she sings and cooks good; you cold be compiling two different people such as martha stewart and brittany spears.  Combining the two does not make them less real, it just combines them.  This way the facts are right, they are just listed with the wrong name, and too many good attributes.|`|AA10242125	I think that he is a composite of real people and legend.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I think he is just a legend.  The only British historian writing at the time he is supposed to have lived (around 500 AD) a monk called Gildas, doesn't mention him at all, and it seems very odd that he would neglect to mention such an important person.<br>  <br>  Bede, writing two hundred years later, mentions a British leader called Ambrosius Aurelius "a man of good character and the sole survivor of Roman race from the catastrophe.  among the slain had been his own parents, who were of royal birth and title.  Under his leadership the Britons took up arms, challenged their conquerers to battle, and with God's help inflicted a defeat on them.  Thenceforward victory swung first to one side and then to the other until the battle of Badon Hill, when the Britons made a considerable slaughter of the invaders."<br>  <br>  I think Ambrosius Aurelianus, if he existed, is probably the closest you can get ot a real Arthur.

Sometimes Manifest Destiny was interpreted so widely as to include the eventual absorption of all North America: Canada, Mexico, Cuba and Central America. It has also been used to advocate and justify other territorial acquisitions, as well as to justify the genocide of the Native American populations who were standing in the way of its believers and supporters. Advocates of Manifest Destiny believed that expansion was not only good, but that it was obvious ("manifest") and certain ("destiny"). Originally a political catch phrase of the 19th century, "Manifest Destiny" eventually became a standard historical term, sometimes used as a synonym for the expansion of the United States across the North American continent which the belief inspired or was used to justify.

W1h3w5gdaa	I really, really don't like your guitar instructor, knowing just that piece of information. A good instructor doesn't chastise the player for things they need to improve. He or she should just help you improve it.<br>  <br>  As a guitar instructor myself, I'm appalled and I suggest you go find someone else, pronto. Additionally, your teacher should be making it a priority to help you decide what direction you want to go in, and then support you in reaching that goal.<br>  <br>  So, how do you decide? It sounds like you want to play with other musicians (presumably in a band.) That's a decision, and you should absolutely go for it.<br>  <br>  And, screw sheet music. Tab will be just fine, if you even need that. If you know your scales, why in the world would you need to read sheet music? Sounds like your parents and your "teacher" are being somewhat pretentious and assuming that, in order to be a good musician you need to read sheet music.<br>  <br>  Some of the best musicians who ever lived had no ability to read sheet music, and didn't "know" their scales in a formal sense. People don't understand that theory is not a rulebook for music. It's simply a way we can talk about what happened with the music we played. Notes existed long before we gave them names.<br>  <br>  If you like the blues, I suggest you find a blues band and start playing with them. That's what I did; long before I had lessons, I found a friendly blues band and marched up on that stage with my crappy guitar. I was a nervous wreck and I sucked, BAD. I blew it. And no-one cared; they just smiled and said "don't worry, you'll get there."<br>  <br>  And I did.<br>  <br>  Believe in yourself, don't listen to others doubting you or telling you what you can and can't do. I know I sound like a Lifetime Original Series script here, but I'm dead serious.<br>  <br>  Finding your rhythm is simply a matter of practice. I speed up when I play, and I'm a professional. I play with bands and I've auditioned with seven in the last week.  All of them have extended me offers to be in their bands. And I speed up. So remember that. Use your metronome and try your best to discipline yourself to hold the groove, it helps.<br>  <br>  Alright, that was a bit of a rant and I'm sorry, but I just hate to see someone with a passion for music getting discouraged by their parents and, worse, instructor. That's just deplorable.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and just remember what Winston Churchill said: "Never quit. Never, never, never quit!"|`|nDcSY8UQaa	I can read piano, organ and guitar sheet but cannot sight read it for love or money, so I quit trying years ago, and only use it to memorize a certain riff if need be, but I never had intentions of becoming a professional musician it the first place so playing by ear and being able to improvise with tabs and chords suits me fine on the guitar, shoot, strap on the harmonica and warm up the vocal chords lets have some fun, I'm not going to sound like the original artist but you'll know what song I'm playing, and I usually hear play another now days instead of put that thing away fer christ sakes

rfYvOuN2aa	well i live in l.a. for the last several years and i've yet to get a decent connected agent.  forget about CAA unless you are already established and regularly working.  they only accept established stars.  get the agents list from samuel french bookstores and then submit from that list.  you need a good picture and some decent credits to land a good agent unless you are model beautiful.|`|draNVjbkaa	Unless you have a CELEBRITY endorsement, several appearances in major films and television shows, you DON'T have a chance with CAA, William Morris, UTA, ICM, and Endeavor. You also DON'T have a chance with B Agencies like Gersh, Paradigm, and Stone Manners without the things mentioned earlier. These agencies DON'T take new talent.<br>  <br>  To get an agent in general, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  <br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too.<br>  -Attend a showcase and impress them. By showcase I do not mean scammy conventions like IMTA, Proscout, or Best New Talent. I mean legit ones like at TVI, Reel pros, etc.<br>  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in<br>  <br>  DON'T<br>  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!<br>  -Sign with them if they ask for upfront money, make you take new photos with THEIR photographer, or take THEIR classes. Agent's ONLY make money when you do. Agents usually make 10% on film/tv and commercials and 20% on commercial print<br>  <br>  There are FAKE agencies like John Casablancas, Barbizon, and JRP. John Casablancas, Barbizon and John Robert Powers are all SCAMS! They are NOT agencies! LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print). REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises.<br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.<br>  <br>  These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable and REPUTABLE schools like Howard Fine Studios, Ivanna Chubbuck, TVI Studios, Groundlings, Second City, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W. Brown, Margie Haber, etc. do.|`|xj5lIwaHaa	First most will require experience, and there are better ones (do research). <br>  <br>  For agencies you sign up (hopefully with former experience), and send in the information they need with photo (better if done professionally). Then if they think you are well qualified they will try to find you a job and they get paid (if a good company) after you get the job.<br>  <br>  A little fact: 10% of actors/actress get all the money (making it big). It's not an easy profession, and hope you have a back up career. Example myself getting a psychology degree. Also acting is about talent not always the look.

DenLZAL1aa	The native language of the Romans was Latin, an Italic language the grammar of which relies little on word order, conveying meaning through a system of affixes attached to word stems.[99] Its alphabet was based on the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn based on the Greek alphabet.[100] Although surviving Latin literature consists almost entirely of Classical Latin, an artificial and highly stylized and polished literary language from the 1st century BC, the actual spoken language of the Roman Empire was Vulgar Latin, which significantly differed from Classical Latin in grammar and vocabulary, and eventually in pronunciation.[101]<br>  <br>  While Latin remained the main written language of the Roman Empire, Greek came to be the language spoken by the well-educated elite, as most of the literature studied by Romans was written in Greek. In the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which later became the Byzantine Empire, Latin was never able to replace Greek, and after the death of Justinian, Greek became the official language of the Byzantine government.[102] The expansion of the Roman Empire spread Latin throughout Europe, and over time Vulgar Latin evolved and dialectized in different locations, gradually shifting into a number of distinct Romance languages.|`|iJzIIEdfaa	Latin and Greek (particularly by nobles and traders)|`|Bybyupdvaa	greek or latin silly! mainly greek i think but good luck writting the whole thing tonight!

NYU37jfGaa	In early Republican Rome most children of wealthy families were educated entirely at home, often by pedagogues - tutors who were slaves.  Cato th eElder was an exception, he taught his son himself.  He taught his son reading, law, athletics, riding and swimming, when he began writing his History he copied it out in large handwriting especially so his son could read it.  For Cato only the home could provide the modling of character that was essential for a Roman citizen.<br>  <br>  By the 1st century BC it was more common to be educated outside the home.  Schools varied in quality and most teachers earned little.  The first school a child attended taught elementary reading, writing, and mathematics.  Wealthier children would move on at age 11 to a grammataicus where they would leanr poetry by heart.  clear speaking and pronunciation were encouraged, and it was at this stage that the child would learn Greek.  Later training with a rhetor would set up the young upper-class Roman as an orator able to make his way in the courts.  For a lucky few, education might be completed with some time in Greece.<br>  <br>  Girls might attend elementary schools, or they might be educated at home.  Pliny the Younger, a senator and author of the end of the 1st century BC, wrote about a girl who died at thirteen, just before she was to be married:<br>  <br>  'How she loved her nurses, her preceptors, and her teachers, each for trhe service given her.  She studied her books with diligence and understanding.'<br>  <br>  Unlike boys, girls did not study with philosophers or rhetoricians outside the home, for they were married at the age when boys were still involved in the pursuit of higher education.  <br>  <br>  Educational accomplishments were thought to enhance a woman.  PLutarch wrote in complimentary tones of educated women, fore xample Cornelia, the wife of Pompey, who was particularly charming because she was well read, could play the lyre, and was adept at geometry and philosophy.  Pliny the Younger was pleased that his young wife was setting his verses to music and singing them to the accompaniment of the lyre.  Quntilian recommended that for the good of the child both parents be as highly educated as possible.<br>  <br>  Girls would be expected to learn household skills as well, particular importance was attached to spinning and weaving, since cloth production was generally done by women in ancient times.  At weddings spindle and distaff were carried by young women as symbols of the wife's role in charge of the home's spinning, weaving and clothmaking.  By Ad 50 though these customs had died out and wealthier Romans bought their cloth from shops.<br>  <br>  Of course, there would have been a lot of children in Rome who would have had little or no academic education.  The children of the poor, and slave children, would go to work as soon as they were old enough.  poor free children m ight work at whatever trade their parents followed, and slave children would do whatever their owners wanted them to.|`|qgs155HNaa	H.

Just about pain and being in the dark, there's something going on while the character talks to the reader. Just spice it up some more, what's different about this story than other books in it's genre? You want that difference to stand out right in the beginning. I would scratch the ' No, I am not emotional if that’s what you’re thinking,' it isn't completely necessary and takes away from the flow of the description. Also 'Most of all' should be 'Worst of all' (but even that is a tiny bit overused in literature, so maybe think of another creative intro to main sentence).<br>  <br>  Edit: Everyone is talking about how it doesn't make sense, but that's what prefaces are about. They don't need to spill the beans. You did a good job with it, don't worry about that. Laying out all the info in the preface is a no-no.

pI5jKfmaaa	King Arthur is a legendary British leader and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians. The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin.<br>  <br>  The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). However, some Welsh and Breton tales and poems relating the story of Arthur date from earlier than this work; in these works, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.<br>  <br>  Although the themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical version, Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul. In fact, many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the wizard Merlin, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's birth at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century.

He was most likely the invention of a 9th century author.  The only thing that we have that might actually be him is a "sewer cover" (basically just a slab) that says "Artogonu descendant of Coll had this made"  this is dated to either the 6th or 7th centuries (this name sounds like Arthur, so everybody was like, hey!  That must have been Arthur).  Tintagel was a 5/6th century post-Roman centre of power and today the economy is supported by the tourism industry.  Tourists can even go visit Merlin's cave.  Anyway he is probably still famous because there is a great amount of romanticism in the story of his life.  The myth has become an important part of popular culture.  Historians still do not know much about the time period in which Arthur is reputed to have lived in, this adds to the mystery of the story.<br>  <br>  Edit: The first person totally copied and pasted from Wikipedia.  I know this becasue I did some checking on the facts that I was sure were wrong (I mean he totally left the foot notes in!)  Here is something refuting his statements (or wikipedia's statements")<br>  <br>  "In "De Excidio Britanniae", St. Gildas (sometimes called "The Wise"), a 6th century British monk, denounced in the most aggressive language possible, the terrible wickedness of his times. He is the only substantial source which survives from the time of the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britain, and the best source prior to the much more impressive work of the Venerable Bede (who completed his "Ecclesiastical History of the English People" almost 200 years later, in 731). Below are some excerpts from "De Excicio Britanniae" concerning that portion of the fifth century when the events occurred which are now believed to be the millieu out of which came the legend of King Arthur. It is curious that a personage so great as Arthur is not mentioned at all. It is also curious that the only person connected with the Arthur story, who is mentioned, is Ambrosius Aurelianus."<br>  <br>  this rather long quote basically says "isn't it strange that Arthur is never mentioned by Gildas?"<br>  <br>  Anyway I just had to do that because I hate it when people are lazy and lie (he didn't cite his source).<br>  <br>  This site has some really good information on Arthur <a href="http://www.britannia.com/history/h12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannia.com/history/h12.htm...</a>|`|65960a4770fc3571b7f8bfa49f7590feaa	King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against the Saxon invaders in the early 6th century.

Midnight sun then Breaking dusk i think|`|02O0SnUWaa	yes, breaking Dawn is officially the last book in the Twilight Saga. =( midnight sun is like the Twilight book in Edwards point of view.  she may or may not make 3 more books after that from Edwards point of view, she is still deciding.  but there are 3 more movie to look forward to and an official twilight saga guide. which is pretty cool to have! i highly recommend getting the guide it clears everything up and gives more info on the vampires and stuff.|`|j5l2Nbsuaa	Breaking Dawn its the last book, but there making Midnight sun which is the whole story again but by Edwards point-of-view u can check it out at Stephanie Meyer's website....|`|B1LkXUKvaa	yes, but if u r that in love with twilight, go on her website and read her partial draft of midnight sun (twilight in edward's point of veiw), and/or read fanfiction<br>  hope this helps|`|xw495UB8aa	in a few years they may have the very 1st one in edwards point of view.<br>  <br>  and they have the twilight saga guide out now.|`|Get4HnNKaa	you get twilight vanquisher when you kill sartharon with all three drakes up|`|CKbgrp9xaa	there is an exert from the next book in the series online it's like 300 pages but you could search for i9t on google<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  didn't you love the series?|`|4PIhwSxSaa	Breaking Dawn was her *official* last book in the Twilight saga, but that was a lie because she started on a draft to Midnight Sun, a Twilight from Edward's point of view.

YA36FUf1aa	Although Europe is brilliant (well, I am a European so I would say that), you might have a few problems. I bet you'd want to go home. Would you seriously never want to see your family and friends again? You could wait until you're older and move to Europe then.<br>  <br>  Things you will need to consider:<br>  <br>  Language - Britain and Ireland are the only English speaking countries in Europe. Unless you speak another language, you might have trouble being understood.<br>  <br>  Immigration laws are very strict in some European countries and a non-EU citizen (assuming you are an American citizen and don't have dual nationality or anything this means you) would need to apply for a visa to stay for more than a few weeks.<br>  <br>  Money - can you afford to live? If you want to work then you'll need a work permit and visa. People under a certain age aren't allowed to work full time in the UK and I assume the rules are similar in other European countries.<br>  <br>  Accommodation - is there anywhere where you can stay? Where could you live in the long run?|`|dL4x119gaa	firstly, it's a.w.o.l.<br>  <br>  dude, how old are you?<br>  <br>  i'll bet you don't know the first thing about living on your own...especially if you're willing to let your family, teachers, and friends freak out when you dip.<br>  <br>  as soon as you cross a border you'll be caught...you have no way of earning food.  chances are you aren't fluent in any european language, and you have probably never stayed by yourself for longer than a few months.<br>  <br>  you can live your life just as easily here as you can in europe.<br>  <br>  ...the grass only SEEMS greener on the other side.|`|cfvAJJqdaa	ah. A wall. Yes I higly recommend that you go "a wall"<br>  <br>  Why don't you go a-wall in the US, or down to mexico, so you don't waste our (Europe's) police resources WHEN they track you down and find you.

If they were both middle-aged and good/nice people, then I would pick the rich person because money does also affect my choice (especially that much) and really, what does the homeless person have to live for?

The fact that someone would pay me to basically let someone die in front of them disgusts me.

I would tell the rich man to step out of his sea of money and the poor man to get out of his bath of stink.<br>  <br>  Sorry, that was a tad mean.

If the person were smaller I would favor them as EASIER to rescue and thereby more likely of success. If I knew about the rich man vs the homeless i would let the homeless man drown and push the rich man down.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	rich people will say anything to be saved. thats my opinion, who is he to say he will give you that much money, when you save him he could turn around and say "sucker" and walk away without giving a reward. i would pick the poor person. the poor know how to be humble and they know humility. it wouldnt take me long to decide. because i wouldnt save the rich person. you said pick one you cant MAKE us choose to pick the rich person.
gaXUIduMaa	If they ask for any money for anything whatsoever, it is a sign of a ripoff.  Beky B above found one dishonest person posing as a talent scout, there are HUNDREDS of them.|`|5oM3F05uaa	you should not have to pay them!!!!!!!!!!!! if they want even 1 cent its a scam believe me that has happened to me before one day a guy called me ito addition because he said i was beautiful and i was gonna go in for a photo shoot but then he says ''oh i FORGOT you have to pay me 700 dollars and 50 dollars a week if you want me to keep you contract!" and so me and my mom were like forget it!! and i walked out on my dream of modeling and acting/singing. so if you ever meat a talent scout named FRANCIES MAREOLOF HE IS A LIAR do not give him any money or any other talent scout that ask for money!
27d6fd19ae9c4fc896c24ed094c8929faa	I haven't used that particular program though I do speed read & have for years. The question you asked has both a yes & no answer. Yes, you do comprehend it as well if you are taught properly how to speed read. <br>  <br>  But here's my reason to answering no also. Books are for enjoyment & to escape so why would you want to speed it up? Look at it like this. I understand boy loves girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl again. It's all the various ways that same plot is expressed that makes it interesting.<br>  <br>  I only use speed reading for standard contracts & documents to pick up on any variation of the standard or directions or years ago school work. The books I read for pleasure I want to last. I've even read books I was sorry to see them end. Not because of a bad ending but because the places it took me were so vivid in my mind I didn't want to leave.<br>  <br>  Speed reading is great & has it's place but never with the books you read for pleasure.|`|ITp29ACWaa	A few years ago I used a speed reading program. It was wonderful, and I was reading faster without losing any comprehension. The thing is that a lot of the time you can't even tell you're reading faster. It just gets to be automatic. It increases the rate you read comfortably so even though you're reading faster, it still feels like you're reading at the same pace. The only time you'll tell the difference is when you finish a book and look at the clock, and it's 2pm opposed to 3pm. It's definitely worth it so stick with it.|`|NpSsLV9Oaa	with speed reading you pick up on all the key information and facts, so you get most of the details. to be a good speed reader you need to have a good memory to store the details for good comprehension.<br>  if you can't do that, then you won't get as good of an understanding as when you read it through normally.<br>  whether it works for you or not, it's always a useful skill|`|Iwk92vqyaa	No, you won't get the comprehension, nuances and general over-all impressions of any book at all through "speed-reading."<br>  Years ago I tried it myself (the concept is far from new) and quickly saw it did not help me get my degree. (Eng. Lit.) Plus I took more courses post-grad but nothing was read by this method, after a couple books using it in freshman year.<br>  <br>  When a person reads a book this way, too many details are lost. <br>  In other words, to speed-read, the reader MUST skip some words.<br>  For classics, how-to books, fiction or even a manual, details are very necessary for good comprehension. ADD: And enjoyment.<br>  <br>  Even when, one night at the uni, I 'crammed' for a language test (German) all night, for which I'd only shown up one time in the actual class, I knew by then I had to read every word of that text, and carefully. <br>  <br>  End of that story: the prof must have been newish at teaching another language, because I was lucky in that she asked for nothing to be actually said or translated from the spoken word. I could never have pronounced or heard anything correctly; I'd never heard it much at all. <br>  Got an A on the final. <br>  In those days the profs sent postcards to notify students of grades on both the final and for the entire class. <br>  <br>  That's how I learned I got an A for the final and a C for the class: the prof added a note by the finals grade: "I don't know HOW you did this!" and I knew the C reflected the fact she knew I was never actually in class, not enough to count.<br>  <br>  I considered myself quite lucky; didn't have to take another language course to fullfill all required for my degree.<br>  So: In my humble opinion, even 'speed-reading' a question on this site is likely to get your answer discarded as 'not best', because you can easily miss (usually in 'details') just what exactly the asker is asking for...<br>  <br>  ADD: Sure, reading lots of books helps both the speed at which you read and your ability to see all there is in books.<br>  This is NOT speed-reading. <br>  --This is called: Practice and Time. <br>  For books: speed of comprehensive reading is gained by reading Lots of books, Many books and over a rather extended length of time... Practice and Time.--|`|xN29zstYaa	I can speed read and still understand what i'm reading, but i've been speed reading since i was 5.  It is definitely harder to speed read classics.  I sometimes have trouble myself.  If you want to learn how to speed read, you should start with a book you can relate yourself/life to. It takes a lot of practice. To be truthful, not everyone can speed read even after practicing. But don't give up too soon, you should keep trying. Speed reading make a lot of things way easier.|`|IqvhqhSKaa	Well speed reading is to get the just of it, not the beauty, so for how to books yeah... but for classics where you need to know the setting to get the mood, no.|`|hh9IdFlxaa	It works !

W1h3w5gdaa	A lot of my students have Jasmine guitars by Takamine, and they have no problems with them that I've witnessed. That being said, I have no experience with the electric pickups on the acoustic models, so I can't offer much advice on that.<br>  <br>  I will say that, for the money, they're right up there with Yamaha, Dean and Ovation on low-end guitars. They are good quality for what you're paying.<br>  <br>  Caveat: These are all generalized statements. Each guitar is unique and comes with its own set of personal nuances. If you're getting it for free, then no worries. But if you're paying for it, play it for a little bit first and make sure it's okay.  This is why I'd never buy a guitar online. The Internet is like a box of chocolates...|`|nDcSY8UQaa	Takamine makes great guitars, Jasmine is there entry level model.<br>  any guitar is better than no guitar. and free ones are the best.<br>  it is what it is, dont fall in love with it, once you learn the ropes your heart will find your guitar|`|KBBonf97aa	Jasmine guitars are actually fantastic for people just getting started, since they're well-built, sound great, and have thin necks that make it more comfortable to move around between notes and chords.  As someone with small hands, I'm always looking for guitars with thin necks and low action (the distance between the strings and the fretboard).  I was really impressed with the Jasmine acoustic/electrics when I played them.  And a lot of people think guitars that don't have Gibson or Martin on the headstock aren't worth owning, but there are plenty of fantastic guitars that don't cost a fortune, but will still last decades, including Jasmine by Takamine.<br>  <br>  I know this guitar isn't the same model number as the one you're considering, but it's also a Jasmine acoustic/electric and the reviews are very impressive.  Here's the Musician's Friend link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/Jasmine-by-Takamine-ES450C-Quilttop-AcousticElectric-Guitar?sku=520095" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...</a><br>  <br>  Enjoy your guitar and good luck!

2QPUs8lBaa	It seems like alot of books have been written like that... It would be interesting if the writing was really good though. Read the book Stargirl. It's about a girl who doesn't care what anyone thinks.|`|AA11111233	That would be a great idea for a short story.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Yupp!!! i wouldnt mind reading it, but then again i like books liek that... helps me with my issues right now in life... i wouldnt mind reading it if you write it. <3 i would totally read that throw!!|`|n9p5cycsaa	Kind of I guess. But I've heard better. It sounds more like something that would be a side story to an episode of some TV show or something.|`|YFmtHNkiaa	yeppers! luv it!|`|cAauS5aqaa	Yeah, but it would have to be an adult novel....if it was teen, i couldn't mess with it.|`|AA10906922	If you are interested in writing the story, then write it. We have to go where are hearts lead us. Create believable characters and anyone would be interested in reading your story. If you don't believe this, then read any Stephen King book. No matter how outlandish his stories are we love to read them because he creates believable characters. Good luck with your writing!|`|6df4a185c463cc37ea6503789eaa5390aa	It is an interesting story. Try to gather things from your own experiences as well as imagination.|`|z6X4sbXZaa	Its fine but too... generic. Make it your own, unique, with a little more climax.|`|uzPi9dPraa	Sure...depends on how it's written though.|`|uKyfRzxIaa	not really :(|`|IqvhqhSKaa	dont see a climax but its ight
yBCNCmG2aa	There are many types of dancing, remember that.<br>  <br>  Although in ballet, ballerinas have to train very hard and professionally and are normally disciplined, there are styles of dance where you don't neccesairly have to work professionally or train 365 days a year!!<br>  <br>  Although I do admit hip hop is much rather a street dance compared to classical ballet, it can actually take you quite far. You can be accepted into dance companies and dance competition merely by your own choreography, and most people prefer to dance hip hop.<br>  <br>  There are also many styles of dance similar to hip hop, such as funk, krump, popping and breakdance. So dancing isn't just all about classical music, pointe shoes and tutus.<br>  <br>  Classical ballet is a beautiful type of dance but you have to spend so much time and money. But in hip hop, you can do it either for fun or do it for years and be a professional.|`|bYU77eteaa	tell her to do what she does and you do what you do.  Its dancing|`|ixOE0onnaa	dance it all the way through.|`|0VUFAa6raa	i think dancing is using your body to express yourself. It's a dance and should be respected just like any other dance style. I know ballet is reputable because of it's difficulty and the disipline that's required but hip-hop has elements that are of equal difficulty. If she's a dancer i would have thought she would be able to appreciate all styles of dance.|`|vQ0F5g5Kaa	I think she's right to be a ballet dancer you need flexibilty strength and still look graceful all the time and you need to have a good ear for music and every step has to be perfect    i think hip hop is a free for all  i agree with you friend|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	lets see her try to dance to hiphop music >.> i bet she cant...it is realy dancing...u move to the rhythm and its an exact down to the positions of movements. god. -_-|`|5oM3F05uaa	tell your friend that hip hop was one of the best dancing styles ever created and ballet is SO boring hip hop is so more exciting!!!|`|3e04b24de8cc6cf82f09f49a41cb0b19aa	Ballet will always remain the central point and starting point for all things that are dance, but Hip Hop dancers believe it or not do train as hard as Ballet dancers do. <br>  Hip Hop although in a different way, has the ability to get technical in the sense of focusing on musicality, utility, facility and mobility [haha or the ilities :D] of the body and taming/rehearsal in order to achieve a certain level of appreciation both internal and from others.<br>  <br>  not to forget there are also techniques and set rules that exist created by street dance masterminds from back in the 70's and 80's that people try to follow.<br>  Dance isnt all about all of these things, as they are all offshoots ideas and concepts created by conscious experimental and inspired minds, just as long as you are able to appreciate and move in such a way with or without music, you are dancing. Period.<br>  <br>  HipHop more so than Ballet, has moved with the times and the culture and it is a form of dance and expression that is more accessible to a majority, so your friend is rather ignorant to have such a view.|`|Me2yvFqjaa	hip hop is DEFINITELY dancing, just as much as ballet. hip hop is even more so as you can add your own style and originality into it more that ballet which is generally set, strict moves.<br>  <br>  The technical side of hiphop (breaking, flips etc.) is very hard and deserves as much recognition as ballet.|`|rxKvdkFyaa	Hip hop is real dancing. Just cuz its not "classic" and its more "modern" it doesn't mean its not dancing. Hip hop is a way to express yourself through music and dancing and no offense to ballet, appeals to more people. In my opinion, both take extreme talent to do. You need flexibility, balance, timing, etc. So yes, hip hop is dancing just as much as ballet is(:|`|foXUn6xWaa	That is very close-minded of your friend. I am a classical ballet dancer, but I appreciate the effort and skill hip-hop takes. Dancing is moving with expression. Hip-hop, Pop, Lock, Jazz and Break are all just as expressive as ballet, just in different ways. Your friend is entitled to her opinion even if if is wrong. P.S. For all of you who said ballet is boring. :P|`|FG5xXm2maa	I think hip hop is ******* sweet. It takes skill... I did a class once, I did quite bad haha, but it definetly takes skill and for sure is called "dancing". <br>  <br>  Ballet is boringgg.|`|FEA3URx8aa	crank dat by souljaboy low by kanye west the way I are by?????|`|AhBJT5xFaa	If you can move your body with the beat, it's dancing.
200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	My pole dance instructor is almost 30. <br>  <br>  Many of her students range from 20 all the way into 50's. All depends on individual person's health.<br>  <br>  If it is a good instructor, she will go at the person's pace and help go around to focus on people's pace's/skills.|`|2WWEn2mZaa	Why would it be too old or too hard? 30 is very young yet. I am clueless over your logic.|`|J2SE5vboaa	a good exercise to maintain that youthful figure.|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	why not..if you gaut it...flaunt it

yLovKIrzaa	The end of the Mayan Calender ends on December 23, 2012 and is suppose to be the end of the world. <br>  <br>  If it is real then very few people will survive and only with a doomsday shelter could you have a higher chance of survival. <br>  <br>  To be honest, of all the doomsday prophesies, this one looks the most legit just because of the extreme accuracy with which Mayans predicted cosmic events. Chances are nothing will happen though|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	While the Mayan calendar ends on December 23rd, 2012; this is not the first time it has happened, it simply restarts.<br>  <br>  This is a fun little myth that people like to toy with, and nothing more.|`|GkH5NoFyaa	listen to tttops. Nothing will happen.|`|dL4x119gaa	(You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)<br>  <br>  dude has no idea what he's talking about.<br>  <br>  y2k was simply computer geeks freaking out.  to save time and space they only programmed the last two digits of the year (99 instead of 1999) and were afraid computers would assume we reverted to 1900 and then crash.  this was fixed in late fall of '99 which is why nothing happened.<br>  (watch office space, the main characters job was to go through lines of computer code and change all the double digit dates to four digit dates)<br>  <br>  <br>  as for 2012, there are a lot of SPECULATIONS of things that might happen.  <br>  <br>  -the earth is supposed to enter an electrical storm in space in 2012<br>  -we are overdue for the poles to switch, which has happened in the past<br>  -in 2012 we change from the house of pisces to the house of aquarius.  every 2000 and some odd years we change astrological houses, and every change has coincided with changes here on earth.<br>  <br>  even if something huge did happen, the human poplulation is large enough it could survive an earthly catastrophe.<br>  <br>  all of these things might change the way the earth looks, but doomsday isn't really plausible.  it would take a rather large galactic event to wipe out a planet.|`|qDYzdz5daa	I assume you're talking about the 12-21 (or 12-12) 2012 nonsense.<br>  <br>  Everything you have heard about 2012 is full of half-truths and outright lies, with the following exceptions.<br>  <br>  1. There will be an American presidential election in 2012.<br>  2. The Summer Olympics will be in London in 2012.<br>  3. The Planet Venus will transit the Sun in 2012. (The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)<br>  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.<br>  <br>  That is all. Everything else is bull.<br>  <br>  Nostradamus didn't predict anything for 2012.<br>  <br>  Some people think the Mayans did, but they are wrong. The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012." The Mayan calendar contains events that happen AFTER 2012, even after 4000 AD, so clearly the world will not "end" at this point.<br>  <br>  (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)<br>  <br>  The hoaxters mainly choose 12212012 because of numerology (which is also garbage) and the repeating and reversal of "12", and also because December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY ancient civilizations. And that's ALL. They just had different ways of counting the years.<br>  <br>  All the other predictions:<br>  <br>  "pole shifts" (which take thousands of years to even start) <br>  "galactic plane crossing" (a lie, we're far above the galactic plane and moving away from it<br>  "galactic alignment" (We don't even know exactly where the galaxy's center is - it's obscured by gas and dust and other stars - so we sure as hell can't predict an alignment with it with any accuracy) <br>  "killer planet Nibiru' (physically impossible) <br>  <br>  and everything else, are completely and totally made-up.<br>  <br>  There are NO scientists who believe in this 2012 nonsense. If you see someone claiming "scientists" said so, ask for names and degrees, because they either don't exist, or got their "degree" from some mail-in fake "university of pulp paper."<br>  <br>  Here's a 2012 Prediction: This answer will be thumbs-downed by obessed 2012 trolls.  (A little less likely in Philosophy than Astronomy & Space, but some of them have diversified.)|`|pexxZB8Daa	its the end of the mayan calendar, its the 12 month and i think the 12 day of that year. i dont know if we can survive it, esp. seeing that we dont know what will happen!|`|8ekoa6szaa	The crystal ball says . . .|`|yaq7oaH6aa	What makes you think we'll last that long?

n9p5cycsaa	Well you won't fully understand her love for Jacob until Breaking Dawn and I will not ruin that for you. Let's just say there's a bit more to it. <br>  <br>  She was upset because, though it was for her own good, she was still rejected. Bella doesn't have the highest self confidence and, though she knows that Edward loves her, it still hurt to be rejected by him, whether or not it wasn't indefinately or if it was for her own good.|`|YFmtHNkiaa	1. hormones raging! she lusts for jacob not loves him.<br>  2. she was feeling completely rejected and that made her feel worthless when edward said no.|`|8mbAoXyJaa	Bella did that only because she wanted Jacob to stay. She didn't want Jacob to fight because she didn't want Jacob to get hurt. So, she kissed Jacob because she hoped that it's enough to make Jacob stay with her.<br>  <br>  Bella was crying because she thought that Edward didn't want her. That he rejected her.|`|Aw58rp7Baa	dear god, i hate bella-b*tch. someone needs to shove her into a hole and cover her with dirt. the. most. annoying. charector. ever. and edward too. jacob, seth & leah are okay.|`|V3Z0Lvidaa	i think she was just disappointed or something like that. i thought she was probably just really desperate to do it with edward. i didn't really get that either.<br>  <br>  *twilight rox!*|`|IqvhqhSKaa	Uhmmm, i dont thing you read the book properly, you miss a couple sentances or what? hahaha

8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	"Castle on a Cloud" from Les Mis.  It's a good choice because it evokes the poignancy of "Maybe," and will show off your voice.  Or "Let me Entertain You" from Gypsy (kid version).<br>  <br>  It's typical NOT to sing a song from the musical you're doing (unless your school or production company requires it... they will tell you), but you want to make them think of you in the part you're auditioning for, and Annie is a ten year old.  Of course it should be a tune from a show and definitely not a pop song .<br>  <br>  Here you can listen to it: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u9QNYjYvYQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u9QNYjYv...</a>|`|9eMYzY0Paa	Something form Annie, or Brandy Carlile-Wasted.|`|5LiXKwVOaa	DO NOT sing anything from the actual play, that is actor rule # 7(?). <br>  <br>  Try something nice and soft like this song by Heart.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQDJ45qJHBQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQDJ45qJH...</a><br>  <br>  It's called "Dreamboat Annie" and I thought of it when you mentioned what play you were doing. Good Luck!|`|8pG8Y3rJaa	Impress the judges with something older, timeless - from the 40s or 50s, maybe a showtune, perhaps Cole Porter, George & Ira Gershwin, etc.<br>  <br>  Also, something that is sort of like "Annie" music, and shows off your voice.|`|fR9Ej1zlaa	definitely "castle on acloud" from the musicla LES MISERABLES. its a bautiful song.|`|DvMS9Jjuaa	Why don't you try something from Annie.|`|xafBVBB2aa	If you are a good soprano, then you could try 'Tomorrow' from Annie. It's a good idea to sing something from the show, depending on what the audition and director is calling for, just to show them that you can do it. If you want something other than from the show, are you familiar with A Chorus Line? Try a song from that to show energy.|`|H8U2ErL6aa	Tomorrow or Maybe (both from Annie) <br>  If you can blow the casting team away with either, the role is yours! It proves you have the voice.
dKrLAJaEaa	Enhance the contrast between the lettering and its background to improve legibility. It doesn't make a successful message if it can't be read. The wolves are delightful.|`|feoxRAUDaa	looks cool...

ji7WZvC1aa	You want to stay with Sondheim - his music is so distinct that there's nothing else like it - singing another one of his songs will show the director/musical director that you can sing in the correct style.  Shawnthepsychic's suggestion of Green Finch and Linnet Bird is an excellent one; you could also look at the Soon section of Now/Later/Soon from "A Little Night Music" - it's not often heard but fits Rapunzel pretty well.  Lovely from "A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum" (as sung by the marvellous Ruthie Henshall on "Putting it Together") is another song which could work for you.  Hope that helps!|`|DIqqgNaVaa	a way back to then from title of show or i am playing me from title of show|`|N1nCrcn0aa	Well, she's a soprano, and she's a girl trying to break free from parental bonds...<br>  <br>  Some suggestions,<br>  The Light in the Piazza - The Light in the Piazza<br>  In My Life - Les Miserables<br>  <br>  Either would be great for that role, but don't be too good, you might end up as Cinderella. lol.|`|vVTOqZeGaa	Rapunzel does not have much of a role all she sings is "ahhh".

IqvhqhSKaa	A good read - a fantasy about what someone wants to happen for them that will fade in a couple years ie. Twilight, Harry Potter<br>  <br>  Goodliteraturee - Well written, that will stand against the test of time ie, Pride and prejudice, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Sometimes they're the same.  <br>  I wouldn't call something a "good read" if it were meaningless, poorly-written trash.|`|4cdb7483e4e06664fd51041ac8118e42aa	a good read will be something you can read real fast because it pulls you in, but afterward you never pick it up again<br>  <br>  good literature will stay with you forever|`|uin3ffWDaa	i think good literature stands the test of time and a book that stays with you forever. for instance anna Karenina wasn't the most enjoyable book i ever read but i still think about the book and it's characters.

dai4nP0yaa	Well there are probably a number of ways. I would go with using a layer mask. Open the image, copy the background layer to a new layer. Desaturate the top layer and then add a layer mask. Then simply paint the normal colour back into the part you want. <br>  <br>  It's really quick to do it that way. Ofcourse there are some limitations, for instance you're stuck with using the colours from the bottom layer, but you can always change those if you need to.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you understand the answer. If not, doing a google search for "selective color" will probably give you a number of detailed tutorials on how to do it.|`|fKco44yxaa	Lol, u have a gimp :D|`|e2e6f09a95da737ded54f7dd54a9656eaa	photo shop two of the same pic together.. one in b&w the other in color|`|0LgpcOBDaa	meegles is actually closer to the truth than he (she..?) knows...<br>  <br>  open the image, make a dup of it. make 1 a bw.. use the clone brush and clone the color parts into the bw parts..<br>  <br>  it's actually rather easy if you 1 - understand the program.. and 2 - think out the process and just what is it you want to do...<br>  <br>  bob - tucson|`|0Dj8pOgoaa	5th time Im answering the same question today....

qlgti3wKaa	I understand that you've just started, but regardless, there are several errors I found. Most have to do with fluency, but one or two are actual mistakes I found. <br>  <br>  First, 239 Maple Lane? No. No, no, no. "Maple" equals the most common, overused name for a street. Bad idea. Come up with something unique. <br>  <br>  Add some descriptive adjectives in there. It makes it more pleasing and fun to read. <br>  <br>  And there is something strange about your fluency. It sounds forced, or maybe a little cliché, if that makes sense. An example, how I would go about doing the sentence "After all, emotional abuse does leave a scar - a scar larger and darker than any corporal neglect you could ever suffer," would be as follows. "Emotional abuse can leave a scar, a scar significantly bleaker and larger than any corporal abuse one could ever suffer." It flows better. Adding "after all" draws attention away from what you are trying to say, as does inputting "does" in there. <br>  <br>  Also, when you say '"It's always about her," He sneered the name. "Isn't it?"' It should be like this: '"It's always about her," he sneered the name, "Isn't it?"<br>  <br>  And one last thing... there are too many breaks (the use of dashes). A few times you used this, a comma should have been used. <br>  <br>  Just a few things to watch for. I would read it, it sounds very interesting, but it does need to be chiseled down and edited.|`|2QPUs8lBaa	Hey, this is really interesting! I got shivers when I read the end. Poor little girl.

But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight.

xyQRD8ahaa	Broadway was the hangout for most of the famous people in the 1920s-the gangsters, like Owney Madden, rubbed shoulders with celebrities like Charlie Chaplin. High stakes poker games ran for days in the back of speakeasies, with Babe Ruth, Al Jolson, and Arnold "The Brain" Rothstein all sitting at the table.<br>  <br>  The history of Broadway New York in the Roaring Twenties was anchored by a delicatessen(remember America was in the midst of alcohol prohibition) called Lindys, where the gamblers, drunks (ironic enough), chorus girls, and celebrities like Groucho and Harpo Marx would converge at 4 in the morning for a bite to eat and to carouse.<br>  <br>  The history of Broadway New York was chronicled and embellished by the beat writer and adopted son of Broadway, Damon Runyon.<br>  <br>  Runyon rubbed elbows with these same gangsters, millionaires, celebs, and vapid chorus girls that graced "The Great White Way".<br>  <br>  Runyons stories were largely responsible for the patois of Broadway, the reason we think of people on Broadway talking about a woman as a "daffy dame", "tough Broad", a "doll, or a "tough gorill". Seemingly tough guys went "daffy over dames" in Runyon's stories.<br>  <br>  This is the language of Broadway, and it would eventually sweep the nation in the popular flapper slang of the 1920s. In Runyon's eyes, New York only existed "on Broadway" and, in his world, it was perpetually between the hours of 11PM and 4 AM.<br>  <br>  In his amazing book Gangsters and Gold Diggers: Old New York, the Jazz Age, and the Birth of Broadway, which I highly recommend to anyone who wants a great fast-paced history of New York in the 1920s, Jerome Charyn says:<br>  "Broadway was a no-mans land, neither the East nor the West. It ate up your past and your tradition. The Big Street was where you went when you had nowhere to go."<br>  <br>  If there is anywhere that seems to live in a vacuum during the 1920's, it is Broadway. In the literature and characters of the time it seemed to live by it's own code, the code of the street--the code of Damon Runyon.<br>  <br>  If there is one tangible link to the early Broadway that Runyon left it can be seen in the Broadway Musical, Guys and Dollswhich is based on "The Idyll Of Miss Sarah Brown" a short story by Runyon based loosely on the "goings on" of Broadway and New York in the early years.<br>  <br>  Runyon created Broadway, as much as anyone could, along with Flo Ziegfeld, and Arnold Rothstein, and Babe Ruth. The history of Broadway New York is littered with seemingly one-dimensional yet larger than life characters.<br>  <br>  The Big Street was a blur of actions and a pit of glittering debauchery. Runyon and the history of Broadway New York are almost complicit in the birth of Film noir, and the Hardboiled detective novel that would soon appear in the decades to come.<br>  <br>  Though it wouldn't appear for nearly twenty years, Mickey Spillane's character "Mike Hammer" was conceived in a dark alley just off 42nd street, America's future love of Humphrey Bogart and the femme fatale was conceived here as well, at least in theory; America fell in love with the black and white morality of the law of the streets.|`|0Cy2PqA2aa	Wikipedia gives you a list of contents about broadway <br>  It says New York did not habe significaant theatre pesence until about 1750, when actor-managers Murray and Thomas Keab established a resident theatre company at the Theatre on Nassau Street, which held about 280 people.They presented Shakesphere plays and ballad operas such as The Beggar's Opera.  In 1752 William Hallam sent a compnay tweleve actors from Britain o the colonies with his brother Lewis as their manager.

AA12253502	I sort of suffer from the same thing, except lately I have been trying to overcome my fear by joining the choir, and singing back-up for soloist. I don't know about you but the main reason I didn't want to sing in front of people was because I was afraid that I might mess up or that they wouldn't like my voice. But what you must understand is that God gave you your voice to help someone. Singing is a gift. Sing your heart out until you can't sing anymore. Even when you're afraid sing. See what you don't understand is this. The people around you wish they could sing as good. I know how you feel, but don't let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.|`|8RCUGAPjaa	I suffered terrible stage fright. I had to perform a cover song for my songwriting class. after that, I was barely ever afraid to perform. <br>  <br>  My suggestion, is to pick out a simple song, prefererably with an acoustic guitar part or piano (if you can't play, I guarantee you you can find someone that can). Then, all I can say, is force yourself, absolutely force yourself to perform it in front of a group of 5-6 friends. I never perform anything in front of family, but if you wan't to, go ahead. The Key to this is to practice, practice, practice the song your going to perform. after a few days, you'll feel less nervous, and even excited to perform, because I was exactly in the position you were in. Now, im rarely ever nervous to perform in front of around 20 People.<br>  <br>  Also, if you eat a banana the day before you're supposed to perform, you'll be less shaky, as bananas have a natural adrenaline suppressant.<br>  <br>  If you don't have an acoustic song to perform in mind, I recommend "rain" by breaking benjamin, or Mad World by Gary Jules-both relatively simple, but with slightly tricky vocal parts. I covered both of those songs, and their very easy.<br>  <br>  Again practice, practice, and good luck.|`|H8U2ErL6aa	I get like that 2...its perfectly normal! If you have a certain performer you look up 2, pay close attention 2 the stage presence they have. Take deep breathes before you go out on stage. Dont make eye contact with audience, pick a spot on the wall and sing 2 it. It takes time but the more you practice, it will be second nature.|`|5LiXKwVOaa	It's very natural because you are always doubting yourself. Just think of singing in a more casual way, like when you're singing along to the radio in the car. Plus, there is nothing wrong with just singing for pleasure, not for people.|`|s5LtTRbtaa	Everybody in the world is like that. Your favorite singers went through the same thing, but like singing itself, it just takes practice. Your first time singing in front of a large number of strange people definitely won't be as good as the rest of them because your nervousness tends to take over the rest of you.<br>  <br>  Sing in front of people. If you feel confident in your voice, just know that being confident is the most important thing and you'll come out on top.|`|zD0zrih8aa	I kind of have the same problem. Except I started singing karaoke. I know it sounds crazy! I know, but I did. It's easier to do so at a bar or something like that where nobody is really listening. It has helped. I still have a hard time singing in front of people I know, but I can sing in front of people I don't know.  I'm sure I don't make sense at all, but thats how I did it. I love singing now more than I ever did! <br>  Good Luck!|`|fR9Ej1zlaa	i was like that, then i joined my middle school chorus. i never auditioned for solos or anything like that. after that i started singing with my friends and now everybody comes to where we hang out at lunch and they request songs.|`|FFtjlMdeaa	If you can sing and you are afraid to sing in front of your family, then the question begs what they say to you about your singing.  One doesn't always get support when attempting to follow a special goal  and of course this may have a serious negative effect on self esteem.  If you can afford it, employ a good singing teacher to assist you.  A singing teacher will instruct you in the finer points that go towards improving the voice and also importantly, self esteem and confidence.  If you lack confidence, you will be unable to use your voice to its maximum potential.  If you cannot afford a singing teacher, then maybe it would be a good idea to join either a choir or a local musical company where you can practice singing in a group; that will both improve your voice and your confidence as well.  A tip that may help your performance as a soloist would possibly be to know your material (songs - lyrics and music) inside out, as being well prepared, helps to minimise pre-performance nerves.  Also, it helps greatly if you have acting ability in that rehearsing as the actual character in the song and not just as yourself will give you the actual "feel" for the song.  "Real" music, as opposed to "static", actually reaches that creative part of the brain and enhances the ability to act and to create the character or mood that the music itself instills.  Good luck.

I would recommend using a plastic cover like a Brodart. These are available at independent book stores catering to collectors.<br>  <br>  You can determine the printing by looking for a page that shows the copyright date, publisher name, etc. Depending on the company, it can say "First Edition" or have a series of numbers 1,2,3,4,5. In this case you're looking for the "1".|`|hwLYv4JFaa	I personally love the old fashioned look. I think you should take the jackets off, but keep them. I would keep them safe in a box somewhere.

DvToP5h7aa	Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen<br>  <br>  Writing Style<br>  How do authors create those earth-shakingly good sentences? Do they like punctuation? Flowery descriptions? Fun accents? Five-syllable words?<br>  <br>  Clear, Witty, Sarcastic<br>  In this dialogue-driven novel, wit and sarcasm predominate the text. Pride and Prejudice is often an exercise in reading between the lines, as Austen’s characters must almost always use polite language to mask their true intentions. (The greatest exception is, of course, when Elizabeth chews Darcy out after his proposal.)<br>  <br>  We’ll offer two examples up for you.<br>  <br>  Mr. Bennet’s response to his wife after she subjects him to a play-by-play of Mr. Bingley’s actions at the ball:<br>  <br>  "If he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had sprained his ankle in the first place!"<br>  <br>  Mr. Bennet clearly doesn’t mean these things. What he’s really saying is that he wishes his wife would spare him the details.<br>  <br>  The following snippet of conversation between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth takes place at the end of a long interrogation from Lady Catherine.<br>  <br>  "‘Upon my word,’ said her ladyship, ‘you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?’<br>  <br>  ‘With three younger sisters grown up,’ replied Elizabeth, smiling, ‘your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.’<br>  <br>  Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence."<br>  <br>  See what we mean? Elizabeth dodges Lady Catherine’s question, but does so in the politest way possible. We call it…polite resistance, and it requires a great deal of quick thinking.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/literary-device/literature/jane-austen/pride-and-prejudice/style.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/literary-device/li...</a>

JpfBoRggaa	by developing a true SELF.<br>  <br>  What rules our life now is false personality. An imaginary person. The person we think we are.<br>  <br>  But if you search long enough and in the RIGHT WAY, you may suddenly WAKE UP and see that somehow you've spent all of your life asleep, not knowing who and particularly WHAT you really are. <br>  <br>  It's quite amazing. There is NO EXPERIENCE that can compare to WAKING UP.<br>  <br>  And when you are awake, you can then move toward complete self confidence. How could you not? You are awake and EVERY SINGLE PERSON  you meet, you can see INSTANTLY that they are in fact, asleep.<br>  <br>  It's very strange at first. Then  you just get used to it.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G True self confidence means to live in such a way that you have no fear and regret nothing. There is an extraordinary individual, named Daisaku Ikeda, who has lived like that for over sixty of his 80 years. He has more than 200 honorary doctorates and professorships from serious universities and teaches others to the best of his ability to live the same way. We don't all need to receive those academic honors. We can live lives of TRUE self confidence, just as we are, by using the LDK consistently.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be one’s decisions based on clarity, That means dumping the guesses and agendas and focusing on what is verifiably pragmatic<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

KBBonf97aa	The easiest way I can explain the difference between a soprano and a mezzo-soprano is to say that in ABBA, Agnetha (the blond) was a soprano and sang the higher, squeakier songs.  And Frida (the brunette) was the mezzo-soprano, whose voice could reach fairly high, but also dip into the alto range.  Here's a Frida song that shows her range really well:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOoNHq6YzqY&feature=PlayList&p=F340E336EF2122C3&playnext=1&index=50" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOoNHq6Yz...</a>|`|FFtjlMdeaa	A mezzo soprano usually has a broad rich soprano voice, not quite as high as a soprano or a coloratura which is pitched at an even higher soprano range.  The soprano/coloratura soprano voices are of a much finer rather than broader sound.  The range of a mezzo soprano is usually between the middle range voice register to upper register.  Don't be confused with a contralto voice which is also rich and broad.  A contralto voice is the lowest female voice and is pitched at the lower to middle end of the voice register.

Today, Alison has a great life?a beloved teenage daughter named Destiny, a happy marriage with advertising executive Collin Archer, and a successful, challenging career as a magazine editor. Alison's fairy-tale existence shatters, however, when the man who attacked her comes back into her life. Country Davis has been in prison for the past 18 years and now has returned to claim his woman and his daughter. Posing as a music executive, he lays a clever plan to snare Destiny, a promising young singer. Alison has kept her secret locked tight, and she does not know where to turn for help. Complicating matters is the fact that Destiny, obsessed with finding out about her father, has hired a private investigator to dig into her mother's past. First novelist Saban, a TV scriptwriter and author of Miracle Child (New Horizon, 1993), carefully builds the tension as the members of this family struggle to handle the very real danger than threatens to destroy all they hold dear.

She reported her crime to the police, who remarked that a young woman had once been murdered in the same location. Thus, he told her, she was "lucky."<br>  <br>  Sebold returned home to Pennsylvania to live with her family for the summer before beginning her sophomore year at Syracuse. After months of no leads by police, Sebold spotted her rapist while walking down the sidewalk. He smirked at her and remarked that he knew her "from somewhere" before continuing on. She immediately called the police, who apprehended him.<br>  <br>  Among her professors at the time was Tess Gallagher, who became one of Sebold's confidantes. [1] Tess accompanied Sebold to several legal proceedings. Also among her professors were Ray Carver, Tobias Wolff and Hayden Carruth.<br>  <br>  During a lineup, Sebold failed to correctly identify her assailant due to the fact that he brought a friend with him who looked exactly like him in order to confuse her and he intimidates her. Finally, he is arrested again and tried for her rape. After he is convicted, Sebold's off-campus apartment is broken into and her roommate is raped. Though no connection to Sebold's rape case was ever proven, she felt that it was retaliation for her rapist being locked up. Her roommate looked at a photo lineup but ultimately decided not to pursue any further legal action.<br>  <br>  <br>  i am sorry that this happened and i hope this helped. there are sick people in this world and they all deserve to be put in jail to rot to death. i really hope that things turn around for you and always remember: no matter how cruel the world seems, there are people out there that care about you and hurting yourself is also hurting them. seek help in those that offer it and love is always out there no matter how nasty others are.|`|AA10112320	I'm so sorry this was done to you :-(<br>  <br>  I'll recommend "The Rape Recovery Handbook: Step-By-Step Help for Survivors of Sexual Assault" by Aphrodite Matsakis, which has very good reviews.

I'll include the Amazon link below so you can check it and other books.<br>  <br>  I just wanted to add that if you're feeling this way, like nobody knows or understands what you're going through, you need to find someone who does. Perhaps there's a support group in your town; if you can't find one, there are online communities - not the same, I know, but it can be a starting point so you can connect with others. <br>  Please don't hurt yourself!

I never told anyone. I blocked it out of my memory. It was a family member. You really need to talk to someone about it, like a rape therapy group. When you talk you heal. When you talk to people who had been through the same thing, they will understand and not judge you. They will empathize and support you. Don't read about other people, you will be more depressed. As time goes by I hope your pain fades. You will never get over it 100%, but you need help to deal with it. Don't be afraid. Your friends might not get it but someone who lived it will and they will help. I wish you all the best and hang in there. One day he will get what he deserves. There is someone out there greater than all of us that we have to answer to. I wish I could give you a hug. Believe me, I feel your pain. I'm so sorry you had to go through that.

For example: "she's an open book".  An open book is easy to read; what the book contains is right there in plain view.  <br>  <br>  You might say this about a person who is easy to read, you can tell how they feel, they always talk about the details of their life... to compare them to "an open book" is a metaphor.<br>  <br>  And alternately, a really private person, someone who keeps their thoughts and emotions... you might call them "a closed book".<br>  <br>  Your poem is cute, but I'm not sensing an idea in it.  What do you want your poem to say?  I see you used numbers as a theme... but what are you trying to say?<br>  <br>  You need to figure that out, and then you can compare it to something else, like the open book, to get your metaphor.<br>  <br>  Remember, a poem doesn't necessarily need to rhyme either.  It should follow a meter though.<br>  <br>  You know what I do for poems sometimes?  I look at a song I like (and songs are always in metered form) and I structure my poem on that meter.<br>  <br>  For example, you know Emily Dickinson?  Many of her poems follow the same meter as "Amazing Grace".<br>  <br>  so you would take the song and see how many syllables are in each line:<br>  <br>  Amazing Grace how sweet the sound (8)<br>  that saved a wretch like me (6)<br>  I once was lost, but now am found (8)<br>  was blind but now can see (6)<br>  <br>  And then use that meter.<br>  <br>  Twenty four hours in a day (8)<br>  Seems much too short for me (6)<br>  There are 31 days in May (8)<br>  Seems like only 30 (6)<br>  <br>  Just an example.<br>  <br>  Try it with other songs!<br>  Hope this all helps!|`|oiBbUnMvaa	A simile is comparing two things using like or as.. <br>  example. she was as high as a kite<br>  A metaphor does not use like or as.<br>  example.He has the heart of a Lion|`|DkeNHYWFaa	I think the poem is pretty cool.

amcqJkWhaa	... and also how to the professionals color them... do they use a computer program and if so which one... i never notice any streaks in the color, but i dont know...<br>  <br>  Well I think some might use watercolors for covers, or perhaps copic markers too. Copic markers seem to have a good reputation, and I think they are known for being very blend-y. <br>  They could also do things digitally... there are some programs, like Painter or Open Canvas or Adobe Photoshop, that can make things appear as if they were made with traditional materials, but really it's digital brushes to make an effect of that. A possibility. I'm sure different mangaka have used many things and programs for coloring. <br>  But, regardless, if what they made looked good, it is more about the skills and taste of the ARTIST, who uses the TOOL, and not the tool itself, that makes it something awe-worthy. So I suggest you learn about color theory and good use of color.  There are people who are very admired by their coloring skills, more than others. I, for one, admire the covers of all of Miki Aihara's manga (she is the author of Hot Gimmick and the newly released Honey Hunt, and many others). <br>  <br>  Also maybe... well it's a pretty common subject, the concern about style. Well, realize manga/anime, the style is just.... style, and I think you should rather focus on drawing things well, than on drawing in a style or finding your style. Because it shows up. Saying something is a 'style', can be just be an excuse sometimes for lacking technical skill, and can be synonymous with 'blind mistakes and habits'. So... try to draw WELL. <br>  <br>  I also think Miki Aihara can draw figures pretty well, and she has a distinctive style, but I more like to look at how she draws fully and with nice form... So it's just appealing to look at her drawings sometimes, as opposed to other artists. They draw too... skinny and flat, and possibly not much real observation is done, and sometimes it feels like people draw the bare minimum, of passable, without really going further, out of joy... <br>  <br>  Anyhow, I think perhaps some of these links will be useful to you. <br>  <a href="http://aperturequiet.blogspot.com/2007/01/john-ks-animation-school-revisited.html" rel="nofollow">http://aperturequiet.blogspot.com/2007/0...</a><br>  <br>  Look at the links with 'silhouette' and 'action line' in the titles, and also, well, all of it is good info., but there is also some discussion of good color use, which I trust you'll find there.

4RrzVNHRaa	I absolutely love Velocity by Dean Koontz. It was the first book I read by him. It's not that long but it's impossible to put down! A man finds a note and on the note is written a choice. The choice is go to the police and the person who wrote the note would kill a young school teacher. If he didn't go to the police the note writer would kill an old lady. As the book progresses there are more notes and the person has to make choices of what to do.

Odd is such an endearing character.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy stories with dogs, Watchers is really good. The Darkest Evening of the Year is also enjoyable.<br>  <br>  Lightning is an interesting one with a different take on time travel. The Christopher Snow books (Fear Nothing and Seize the Night) are good; Christopher Snow's sense of humor reminds me a bit of Odd Thomas. Life Expectancy was good and was sometimes humorous.<br>  <br>  If you like apocalyptic stories, you might enjoy The Taking.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy horror stories, Phantoms would be the only true horror story Dean Koontz wrote (though others have elements of horror in them).<br>  <br>  Since this may get confusing, I'll tell you that The Face, Odd Thomas, Watchers and From the Corner of His Eye are probably my favorites so far. Each was very unique and interesting.

xjBFwsVMaa	Have you heard of Animorphs? lol<br>  Try drawing a person turning into an animal... Am sure you can find a picture of a person turning into a wolf.<br>  <br>  Person turning into a mermaid or a person with wings.<br>  <br>  I just read something where fish go through that as well and crabs.<br>  <br>  Read this its very interesting and will give you several ideas<br>  <br>  Stories of such transformations were very popular in the Hellensitic period; several authors are known to have complied collections of them, although all such collections are now lost, with the exception of some excerpts which have survived under the name of a writer of the early Roman empire, Antoninus Liberalis. However, the Roman poet Ovid collected about 250 transformation stories, which survive as the Metamorphoses. In Apuleius' book of the same title, more commonly known as the Golden ***, the hero Lucius tries to uncover the secrets of witchcraft but is transformed into an ***. After a series of adventures, he is restored to human form by the goddess lsis. In all these stories the theme of metamorphosis is used to question the established boundaries between human and beast, god and mortal, animate and inanimate, thus becoming a way of exploring the limits of what humanity can do.<br>  <br>  The following accounts of metamorphosis are best known from Ovid, and are also common in Renaissance as well as classical art. Daphne was a river nymph who was chased by the god Apollo; she asked her mother, the earth goddess, to change her form, and became a laurel tree, thus escaping the god's advances. Callisto was a princess or a nymph, who was seduced by Zeus. In some versions of her myth, she was transformed into a bear so that this could take place, but in others her metamorphosis is a punishment for her pregnancy, and she gives birth to a human son while she is a still a bear. Her son later kills her by mistake when hunting. In a particularly violent myth of transformation, Tereus leaves his wife Procne and rapes her sister, Philomela, telling Philomela that her sister is dead. To ensure Philomela's silence, he cuts out her tongue. Philomela discovers the truth and sends her sister a message woven into a tapestry; Procne then kills her son by Tereus and serves his flesh to his father. When Tereus pursues the sisters threatening to murder them, they ask the gods for help; all three are transformed into birds, Tereus becoming a hoopoe, Philomela a nightingale, and Pronce a swallow. The order of the last two is reversed by some ancient writers, because an alternative version has Procne as the victim of Tereus' silencing, and the bird forms are significant; the hoopoe, being a crested bird, is ‘royal’, while whichever sister loses her tongue must be the one who becomes the bird with the power of song who, in the words of T. S. Eliot, ‘Filled all the desert with inviolable voice’ (The Waste Land).<br>  <br>  In all these stories, violent attempts to transgress the boundaries of the female body by rape act as the catalyst for the dissolution of the boundaries between humans and the rest of the natural world. It is, however, not only women who are the subjects of metamorphosis in a sexual context. A myth concerned with the preservation of the boundary between gods and mortals tells how, when the hunter Actaeon accidentally came upon the goddess Artemis bathing, she turned him into a stag and he was then torn apart by his own hunting dogs. In some artistic representations of his metamorphosis, seen as a particularly cruel one because he did not intend to disturb the virgin goddess, the still-human Actaeon is shown in the process of sprouting horns. Some versions of the myth take his violation of Artemis' chosen isolation further by suggesting that he wanted to marry her. In a further story of metamorphosis in the context of sexual transgression, the mortals Atalanta and Melanion make love in the sanctuary of a god, and are then punished by being turned into lions.<br>  <br>  As well as the human/animal boundary, that between male and female is also vulnerable; in classical myth, Caenis was a girl who was loved by the god Poseidon, who changed her into the boy Caenus at her request as a gift. Myths that describe transgression do not, however, serve to sanction it in real life. The Oedipus myth, with its central character unwittingly killing his father, then marrying his mother, only to blind himself when the truth comes out, acts as a warning of what can happen if social boundaries are crossed. The fact that Oedipus puts out his own eyes when he ‘sees’ the truth is only one example of the connection in ancient myth between physical blindness and moral vision; other expressions of this are the tradition that the poet Homer was blind, and the myths of the blind seer Teiresias.<br>  <br>  In Greek mythology, several gods had the power to change shape. For example, Dionysos was able to do this, while when the deities Poseidon and Demeter slept together they took the respective forms of a stallion and a mare.

y2WPkydnaa	Hello. I like the imagery and depth that this poem brings to my mind. It seems to be insinuating some mass effect like Jonestown, but when you say "medicine" it could be some effect such as something a government, or other leader/ruler, is giving to the masses that had a chance to get out of their pain yet chose to stay and perpetuate their misery. I also like the "poisoned medicine" oxymoronic statement. Good bye and Bravo.<br>  <br>  P.S- I spelled Jonestown correctly and even though the spell check says that "oxymoronic" is incorrect, it is actually the right spelling. Good bye.|`|cV5IDoDQaa	hmmm, I'm mulling over what it means... it's complex and, it makes sense XD

It's a very good book and heres the prologue.<br>  <br>  Nick and Allie don't survive the crash, and now their souls are stuck halfway between life and death in a sort of limbo called Everlost. It's a magical yet dangerous place, where bands of lost souls run wild and anyone who stands in the same spot too long sinks to the center of the Earth. Frightened and determined, Nick and Allie aren't ready to rest in peace just yet. They want their lives back, and their search for a way home will take them deep into the uncharted areas of Everlost. But the longer they stay, the more they forget about their pasts. And if all memory of home is lost, they may never escape this strange, terrible world.|`|v30jAQuoaa	oh im 17 2! weiirdd. <br>  anyway... these are GREAT books 2 get hooked on... if ur into all that.. teen probz nd stuff... juicy lol<br>  <br>  crank[ellen hopkins] series.... ellen hopkins books<br>  <br>  a child called it series [dave pelzer]<br>  <br>  top 8 [katie finn]<br>  <br>  welcome! :]<br>  <br>  answer mine?|`|t8f3uvr5aa	try the book below|`|Th3bifTWaa	I really recommend The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield if you enjoy books like Jane Eyre.

Laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and let go of what you can't change. Love deeply and forgive quickly. Take chances, give everything, and have no regrets.

Always forgive, but never forget, learn from your mistakes, but never regret.

It is initiated from a totally unconscious God as if an infinite Ocean were in a state likened to deep sleep. This unconscious God speaks the First Word "Who am I?". This question disrupts the limitless, undivided, absolute vacuum, and its reverberations create individualized souls, compared to drops or bubbles within the Ocean. By speaking the First Word, God establishes the process of Creation, in which he assumes evolving forms to gain increasing consciousness.<br>  <br>  Individuality is the vehicle of this quest. Evolution marks a series of temporary answers to "Who am I?" The soul traverses a multitude of forms, beginning with simples gases and proceeding slowly through inanimate stone and mineral forms. These early evolutionary stages obviously have only the most rudimentary consciousness and cannot provide a satisfactory answer to God's original question.<br>  <br>  The original query thus provides a continuing momentum for the drop soul to develop new forms each with greater consciousness, including the many plant and animal beings. Every evolutionary kingdom reveals new dimensions of consciousness and experience. Each also offers opportunities to gain different kinds of awareness. For example, when the soul identifies itself with varied species of fish, it experiences the world as a creature living in waterconversely, as a bird, it enriches its consciousness by flying through air.<br>  <br>  When the drop soul finally evolves to human form, consciousness is fully developed, but an individual is still not aware of the potential of his or her consciousness.<br>  <br>  So the original "Who am I?" imperative persists and inaugurates the second phase: reincarnation. Since consciousness is fully developed, there is no longer a need for evolving new forms. The individual's experience, gathered in early stages of evolution, is now humanized and expressed in countless lifetimes. The impulses gained in sub-human forms can play themselves out in the broader context of intelligence, emotions, choices, diverse setting and interactions with people.<br>  <br>  But obviously no single lifetime can bear the burden of "humanizing" the entire evolutionary inheritance randomly or simultaneously. There must be a method for re-experiencing the pre-human legacy in manageable segments. The soul thus experiences alternately a series of opposites, organized according to themes. Accordingly, in different lives, the soul becomes male and female, rich and poor, vigorous and weak, beautiful and ugly. Through exploring the potential of these many opposites, one eventually exhausts all possible human identities and, therefore, has fully learned the entire range of human experience.<br>  <br>  Here begins the third phase: involution, the process by which the soul returns to the full awareness of the Divine Force, which created him. As Meher Baba puts it, "When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world (the everyday world of matter and forms(, it enters the spiritual path and turns inward."<br>  <br>  Like evolution, involution has certain states and stages, consisting of "planes" and "realms." But individuality continues along this spiritual path. In fact, the book quotes the Sufi saying "There are as many ways to God as there are souls...."<br>  <br>  Each new plane denotes a state of being that differs from the states that proceeded it. The first three planes are within the subtle world or domain of energy, "pran." There follows the fourth plane, the threshold of the mental world, where misuse of great power for personal desire can lead to disintegration of consciousness.<br>  <br>  The fifth and sixth planes represent true sainthood, which is understood to be increasing intimacy with God as the Beloved. On the sixth plane, the mind itself becomes the inner eye that sees God everywhere and in everything. "The loving of God and the longing for His union," says Meher Baba "is fully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness."<br>  <br>  The seventh plane marks true and lasting freedom. Impressions go. Duality goes. The drops burst and again become the Ocean. God answers his question of "Who am I?" with "I am God." The Infinite has returned to the original starting point. He now knows, however, with full consciousness and full awareness that he was, is and always will be infinite. And he realizes that the entire journey has been an illusory dream, the purpose of which is the full awakening of his soul.<br>  <br>  You can download the entire book, God Speaks by Meher Baba, for free in PDF format at:  <a href="http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/BooksByMeherBaba.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/BooksBy...</a>|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	I thought I knew but it just seems to be so frustrating that I don't feel anything for sure anymore.<br>  I thought it was was cooperate with others in a society and work together to help each other, raise children and educate them, do good for others, to learn new things about life and protect our planet, to help others raise themselves up.

y8bFwXZEaa	Subcommands is right--and wrong. <br>  <br>  "It was Plato who formulated most of philosophy’s basic questions—and doubts. It was Aristotle who laid the foundation for most of the answers. Thereafter, the record of their duel is the record of man’s long struggle to deny and surrender or to uphold and assert the validity of his particular mode of consciousness."<br>  Review of J.H. Randall’s Aristotle,<br>  The Objectivist Newsletter, May 1963, 18.<br>  <br>  What Whitehead meant is that even Aristotle's precise refutations of Plato's answers were answers to Plato's questions.<br>  <br>  But since "the record of their duel is the record of man’s long struggle to deny and surrender or to uphold and assert the validity of his particular mode of consciousness," Whitehouse should have said philosophy is a footnote to the 360 degree radical difference between the man who gave us the Dark Ages and the man who gave us the Renaissance.|`|Om7OhWRUaa	He meant that Western philosophy is essentially either continuing the Platonic tradition or fighting against its legacy.

People felt that the US was right on the edge of being vaporized by atomic bombs flying in from Cuba.  There was a lot of paranoia and hysteria.  In school we learned to duck and cover (as though that would help).<br>  <br>  But then came network color television programming, and our fears receded as we stared at the pretty moving colors.  The Beverly Hillbilles in color was an amazing and uplifting transformation from black-and-white.

This raises the question of why they were able to act in such a way when other countries clearly saw that Nazism was a bad idea."<br>  <br>  No, actually several countries, such as Austria, were annexed peacablly, primarily through the cooperative efforts of the largest bank in Austria.<br>  <br>  "Alternatively, some countries decided that they supported his dictatorial efforts and sided with him. These countries created the Axis Powers."<br>  <br>  Supporting dictatorship had nothing to do with their decision whatsoever. Italy joined in the hopes of gaining more land, and Japan didn't care what Germany did a continent away.<br>  <br>  "Considering how many more countries were involved in the Axis, it would seem that the Allies would win immediately."<br>  <br>  Confused by your wording; the way you say it, it seems like the Axis would be the expected winners? I might be reading it wrong though.<br>  <br>  " However, the war lasted from 1937 to 1941"<br>  <br>  Events in Manchuria are sometimes cited as beginning the conflict, but there was no declaration of war between the Axis and Allies until September 1939. I would clarify this or change the date. It's tricky to use 1937, because if you really wanted to go back to the start of the war, you could say it began at the Treaty of Versailles.<br>  <br>  <br>  "It was not until the pact was broken that the British and Americans got involved. But why did we wait?"<br>  <br>  It was actually Britain and France.<br>  <br>  "But the course of events, although it resulted in many deaths of innocent people, resulted in the liberation of Germans and other Europeans."<br>  <br>  I'd rephrase this. Germany was under a dictator they had freely elected and given power ti, and the course of events (the war and the Holocaust) brought on the need for liberation, rather than provide it. You could, however, argue that certain events at the close of the war brought about liberation.<br>  <br>  All in all, very nice essay, but you haven't focused on the Holocaust; you've given a history of WWII in a nutshell. Still a good essay, but if you're topic is required to be the Holocaust, I'd rewrite. Also, I don't think I could ever give a passing grade to a Holocaust paper that never once mentions the Jews! I feel that, in the parts where you did mention the Holocaust, you completely glossed over the true nature of the genocide. If this is for a college-level class, I would refocus, and drop the euphamisms.  :-)|`|uYh1Dhvvaa	It sounds well thought out and smart, but it isn't really about the holocaust, more about Germany during WWII.|`|YtD11EuFaa	Love it!

I'd assume that it refers to a country occupied by Germany, but I think it would be best to define the term in brackets.<br>  <br>  Just remember that Italy was actually the first major Fascist country in Europe, not Germany (although they didn't have quite so big a thing against the Jews)<br>  <br>  2.<br>  "They did, however, convert other countries into Nazi countries. This was primarily done by force."<br>  <br>  Some countries (most notably Austria, as well as areas stripped from Germany by the Treaty of Versailles) were happy to be reunited with Germany. So a lot of it was just done by marching in with parades, lots of shouting and partying etc.<br>  <br>  You may want to mention this earlier in your essay than you did.<br>  <br>  3.<br>  "Considering how many more countries were involved in the Axis, it would seem that the Allies would win immediately. However, the war lasted from 1937 to 1941. "<br>  <br>  Erum, which war are we talking about here...?<br>  <br>  a) You say "...How many more countries were involved in the Axis, it would seem that the Allies would win immediately."<br>  <br>  This appears to be a contradiction - usually, when you have more countries on your side that is a GOOD thing, meaning you will win. However, you seem to imply that the Axis had more countries, and that the Allies would easily win because of that. <br>  <br>  I don't think I'm getting it here. Makes no sense to me; could you explain it?<br>  <br>  4.<br>  "Germany had made an agreement with the Allies that he would, after Czechoslovakia, not invade any other countries."<br>  <br>  Whenever you say something like this, it is always good to give a little background information. I think you should name the agreement.<br>  <br>  "In 1938, Hitler signed the Munich Agreement, stating that Germany would not make further invasions of other countries. This was a continuation of the western Allies policy of appeasment. Less than a year later, however, Hitler broke the agreement and commenced with his invasion of Poland. Britain delivered an ultimatum to Germany to withdraw her troops or face serious consequences, which was rejected by the Germans. As a result, Britain and France immediately declared war on Germany, and the Second World War started."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  5.<br>  You have made a SERIOUS ERROR in your essay! The United States did NOT declare war on Germany when they invaded Poland! It was Britain and FRANCE, not the United States. <br>  <br>  At this point in time, the US was reluctant to take part in any "European" conflicts. The people worried about Hitler were European allies (again, UK & France mainly); the United States sat back for a few years before entering the war.<br>  <br>  (Sorry if it seems like I'm yelling - I wanted to add emphasis on the important words. FRANCE)<br>  <br>  <br>  6. <br>  You should note that although no military action was taken against Germany, the Allies did try to prevent build-up of Germany's forces (e.g. the Anglo-Germany Naval Agreement)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just remember to change the United States to France when talking about the declaration of war (keep the part about the European conflicts not being in the interests of the US as it is). That would be a grave error.

shVgCizBaa	Who was the president of the United States during the very first Gold Rush?11. James Knox Polk 1845-1849  Zachary Taylor 1849-1850  <a href="http://www.clarkscript.com/presidents-usa-list.html#list" rel="nofollow">http://www.clarkscript.com/presidents-us...</a> California's most famous gold rush dates to the morning of January 24, 1848, when James Marshall made his customary inspection of the sawmill he was building for John Sutter. During the previous night, Marshall had diverted water through the mill's tailrace to wash away loose dirt and gravel, and on that fateful day, he noticed some shining flecks of metal left behind by the running water. He picked them up and showed them to his crew, but while he was pretty sure that it was gold, the full significance of his discovery was truly impossible to imagine. He was still concerned about getting the mill finished. <br>  <br>  Word of Marshall's discovery leaked out and immediately set off a "rush to the mines." By the spring of 1849, the largest gold rush in American history was under way. At the time of Marshall's discovery, the state's non-Indian population numbered about 14,000. By the end of 1849, it had risen to nearly 100,000, and it continued to swell to some 250,000 by 1852. <br>  Gold was both plentiful and - by happy geologic accident- easy to extract, making the gold-bearing gravels of California's rivers into what has been described as "the finest opportunity that, has ever been offered on any mining frontier." A contemporary newspaper put it slightly differently: "The whole country, from San Francisco to Los Angeles, and from the sea shore to the base of the Sierra Nevadas, resounds with the cry of 'gold, GOLD, GOLD!' while the field is left half planted, the house half built, and everything neglected but the manufacture of shovels and pickaxes."<br>  <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=1081" rel="nofollow">http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=1081</a>|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	1849?

XvO4iLk0aa	G Do the dump of delusion. Go the way of the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be one’s decisions based on clarity, That means dumping the guesses and agendas and focusing on what is verifiably pragmatic<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

There are many pitfalls and swamps where the air will make you dizzy so that you can fall off a cliff.

I don't know if it was hard or easy for them.  <br>  <br>  I think it is a far stronger foundation to base your sense of self worth not on what you have materially or as capacities but based upon what you have done with your capacities and how you are improving them.  <br>  <br>  You are worth something.

What is the value of a man?  So what is your value?<br>  <br>  Love is the only emotion that gives real value in anything like a ring or a person.  Only love can see the value that no one else can see.  <br>  <br>  Years ago Jesus Christ asked  if man exchange his soul for the world?   There is nothing.  In our day man has knowledge that the world is but a speck in the known universe.  Yet I would say without fear of contradiction from anyone, that there is nothing in this universe that can be exchanged for the soul of even one tiny new born baby.<br>  <br>  The God of this universe loved man so much that he was willing to sacrafice his own son to die for all the eternal souls of man.  For him there is nothing of greater value than that.  <br>  <br>  If a person bellieves this astonishing truth then your own worth is very high.   An object cannot feel the value of what a man's love gives him.  So too do unbelieving hearts feel any kind of love toward a God who loves them.  Only when a person opens up their heart to love will they begin to understand their worth through the eyes of someone else.<br>  <br>  And you, little one, are worth much more than you could possible ever imagine.  Your worth can only be seen not by you but in the way others respond to your kindness to them.  <br>  <br>  I hope you understand this truth.  I hope you understand your worth to both God and man.  For the value that is between them both is the same value that God gives to you as well.<br>  <br>  Be well and believe in yourself because God believed in you enough to die for you so that you could live a full life.  Not just now but in the life to come.|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	get involved with something or someone who depends on you..

I used the scripture from Genesis (located just after the table of contents) because I loved the phrase "the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil." Isn't this exactly what Bella ends up with? A working knowledge of what good is, and what evil is. The nice thing about the apple is it has so many symbolic roots. You've got the apple in Snow White, one bite and you're frozen forever in a state of not-quite-death... Then you have Paris and the golden apple in Greek mythology—look how much trouble that started. Apples are quite the versatile fruit. In the end, I love the beautiful simplicity of the picture. To me it says: choice."<br>  <br>  New Moon: "That is a ruffled tulip. As for the meaning...

And with the content of the book itself, "undying love"<br>  <br>  eclipse- Bella seems to not be able to let go of her human life. The ribbon is connected by a string. She is desprately trying to hold onto her human life, and Jacob, and her new life, Edward.<br>  <br>  breaking dawn-Breaking Dawn's cover is a metaphor for Bella's progression throughout the entire saga. She began as the weakest (at least physically, when compared to vampires and werewolves) player on the board: the pawn. She ended as the strongest: the queen. In the end, it's Bella that brings about the win for the Cullens. As far as I can tell it's a portrayal of bella, since the book revolves mainly around her. I think that the pawn shows her as her human self, weak, vulnerable, and not as able as other pieces in the sence that the pawn has a very limited range of motion. On the other hand, the queen is the most powerful piece, with the least limited range of motion of any chess piece. I think that this represents bella as a vampire, since she is so strong. Also, the colour seems to back this point up. Bella was always blushing as a human, hence the red pawn, it represents the blood running through her...then, when she becomes a vampire the blood is gone and she becomes as pale as the other vampires, hence the white queen. I also think the cover also portrays the fight that was suppose to happen. To win the fight you will need brains. To win chess you need brains. Also, if the fight actually occured, many vampires would've died, just as in chess, many chess pieces would've "died".|`|9Y0rVBLMaa	new moon: if u look closely at the flower, u can notice one petal almost falling out (edward) and a new one (jacob) growing.<br>  <br>  eclipse: represents bella being torn between jacob and edward.

Now select the other one and do the same. Now you cam move one pic on top of the other and you will see the transparency effect.<br>  All you need to do i move them around, resize, enlarge etc... and set the transparency tool to less depending on which picture you want to show more.<br>  If you add a 3rd pic...Same technique, apply the transparency or lens tool. You can even add background to one of the pic and still retain the transparency effect.|`|xcw4EBalaa	Use the Eraser to get rid of the line.<br>  <br>  You may need to adjust it's opacity or edge softness.<br>  <br>  That should do it.|`|S25mQe70aa	make a copy of all layers and turn visibility off of copies. then merge visible layers and use the heal tool. if you mess up you still have the copied layers to go back to.

If you are experienced in not doing homework, then you can say that you have spent your entire life researching this single assignment.

Have your politician give a speech telling how teachers ought to be paid more and be given more respect. Tell about how inspiring a teacher can be. Tell about how they ought to have smaller classes, more planning periods, tax exemptions, no recess duty, enhanced healthcare, a better teacher's lounge, you get the idea—whatever kisses up to them.

Metal guitarists never use the middle pickup anyway so it doesn't matter, good luck!|`|KBBonf97aa	I started building guitars a couple years ago and found a very cool place to buy pickups called Guitar Fetish.  The company takes classic pickups, tears them apart to see how the signature tones are achieved, and then duplicates them and sells them under the name GFS.  For one guitar, I wanted a classic Rickenbacker sound, but couldn't find any pickups that even came close to that.  But GFS makes humbuckers called Memphis that sound exactly like vintage Ric pickups, but sell for less than $40 each!  They've got sound wave files for most of the pickups on the site and they'll send you sample sounds if you request them.

But, now that I have come to terms with my loss, I am affraid of losing my inspiration or motivation to paint, write poetry, or create music, which are three of my favorite hobbies.

7959WbC2aa	Author of over a dozen poetry collections, Paul Zimmer ranks as one of America’s best known poets. He has received two NEA fellowships, the Helen Bullis Memorial Award, two Pushcart Prizes, and an American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award in Literature. In 1998, his book The Great Bird of Love was selected for the National Poetry Series. Also an editor, Zimmer has directed the university presses at Georgia, Iowa, and Pittsburgh, and was instrumental in the foundation of the Pitt Poetry Series (which has published most of the poets appearing in the Poetry-in-the-Round series in recent memory). His latest book is Crossing to Sunlight: Selected Poems, a substantial retrospective of his most famous work.<br>  On or about December 1955, the nature of poetry changed. Or at least in America it did, and radically too. From that point in time, as the Watergate defendants used to say, anyone who could scrape up enough money for a typewriter and a few classes in "creative writing"; had read either "Fern Hill" by Dylan Thomas or "Asphodel, that greeny flower" by W.

The period during which pirates were most successful was from 1700 until the 1730s. Many pirates came to the Caribbean after the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Many people stayed in the Caribbean and became pirates shortly after that. Others, the buccaneers, arrived in the mid-to-late 17th century and made attempts at earning a living by farming and hunting on Hispaniola and nearby islands; pressed by Spanish raids and possibly failure of their means of making a living, they turned to a more lucrative occupation (not to mention more active and conducive to revenge). Caribbean piracy arose out of, and mirrored on a smaller scale, the conflicts over trade and colonization among the rival European powers of the time, including England, Spain, Dutch United Provinces, Portuguese Empire and France. Most of these pirates were of English, Dutch and French origin. Because Spain controlled most of the Caribbean, many of the attacked cities and ships belonged to the Spanish Empire and along the East coast of America and the West coast of Africa. Dutch ships captured about 500 Spanish and Portuguese ships between 1623 and 1638.[4] Some of the best-known pirate bases were New Providence, in the Bahamas from 1715 to 1725[27], Tortuga established in the 1640s and Port Royal after 1655. Among the most famous Caribbean pirates are Edward Teach or "Blackbeard" and Henry Morgan.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy#In_the_Caribbean" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy#In_t...</a>       ---------------------In the early seventeenth century, expensive fortifications and the size of the colonial garrisons at the major Spanish ports increased to deal with the enlarged presence of Spain’s competitors in the Caribbean, but the treasure fleet’s silver shipments and the number of Spanish-owned merchant ships operating in the region declined. Additional problems came from shortage of food supplies because of the lack of people to work farms. The number of European-born Spaniards in the New World or Spaniards of pure blood who had been born in New Spain, known as peninsulares and creoles, respectively, in the Spanish caste system, totaled no more than 250,000 people in 1600. Few Spanish colonists in the New World served as the productive members of society who grew crops or manufactured goods—they all wanted to pursue lives of aristocratic luxury in their haciendas as the masters of great plantations growing food, tobacco or sugar, with African or Indian slaves to serve them and do all of the real labor. This social structure held true throughout the Caribbean and along the coasts of the Spanish Main and would in time create the enormous inequality in the distribution of wealth that plagues Latin America even to this day. Later settlements in the Caribbean islands by other European powers also relied on the labour of non-European workers, namely African slaves.<br>  <br>  At the same time, England and France were powers on the rise in seventeenth century Europe as they mastered their own internal religious schisms between Catholic and Protestant and the resulting societal peace allowed their economies to rapidly expand. England especially began to turn its people’s maritime skills into the basis of commercial prosperity. English and French kings of the early seventeenth century—James I (r. 1603-1625) and Henry IV (r. 1598-1610), respectively, each sought more peaceful relations with Habsburg Spain in an attempt to decrease the financial costs of the ongoing wars. Although the onset of peace in 1604 reduced the opportunities for both piracy and privateering against Spain’s colonies, neither monarch discouraged his nation from trying to plant new colonies in the New World and break the Spanish monopoly on the Western Hemisphere. The reputed riches, pleasant climate and the general emptiness of the Americas all beckoned to those eager to make their fortunes and a large assortment of Frenchmen and Englishmen began new colonial ventures during the early seventeenth century, both in North America, which lay basically empty of European settlement north of Mexico, and in the Caribbean, where Spain remained the dominant power until late in the century.<br>  <br>  As for the Dutch Netherlands, after decades of rebellion against Spain fueled by both Dutch nationalism and their staunch Protestantism, independence had been gained in all but name (and that too would eventually come with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648). The Netherlands had become Europe’s economic powerhouse. With new

swiOhDo2aa	Quite correct. <br>  <br>  Teleological ethics is based on a desirable end ('telos' in Greek = outcome or end).<br>  "Why ought I to be faithful to my wife?"<br>  "It leads to a happy family life."<br>  <br>  Deontological ethics is based on duty. <br>  "Why ought I to be faithful to my wife?" <br>  "You just ought. It's the way things are."<br>  <br>  Utilitarianism is clearly teleological, Islamic or Christian moral philosophy clearly deontological (with divine authority as back-up.)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|lVHqoNVEaa	Teleology is the school of thought that follows consequentialism (something's merit is based on its outcome e.g. Utilitarianism). Deontology is the school of thought that follows purity of intention, rather, if you intend to do good, it makes the act good. Rather like Kantian ethics :).<br>  <br>  [Good to see Michael B went back  and added my suggestion of Utilitarianism as an example :)] lol.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Anything ending in an -ology is more trouble than it is worth!|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	I would define them very slightly differently.<br>  <br>  Deontological ethics to me has to do with INTENTION.  If you are trying to assassinate someone and end up killing another assassin instead, you are still a villain and not a hero.<br>  <br>  This makes it the opposite of telological (or consequentialist) ethics which is concerned with OUTCOME.  It doesn't matter how well-intentioned a doctor is if everyone he treats dies from it.<br>  <br>  You can have rules either way, really... it's just a question of when they are applied and on what.  And both arguably have their place.  A teleologist rewards someone for doing a good job, and a deontologist rewards them for trying to do a good job.

pbw7chpyaa	Order of publication.<br>  <br>  Chronological order would mean you'd start with the hack novels written by his son, which are an inferior breed.<br>  <br>  Most series start with a gateway novel, one designed to introduce you to the series, often later novels assume you've read earlier ones and will omit  important factors.  While prequels will often enlighten a reader as to events, you rarely can understand the context if you had not already read the original novel.  Dune is quite complex, it continues to expand topics you thought were completely explored, you might not ever finish the series.<br>  <br>  <br>  So start with the original, don't worry about the sequels till you get drawn in.|`|uW8B2T7Waa	I don't know the series, but as an author, I'll state that there's a reason for the order of a publication.

Honor that.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Its a personal choice.

bo54Lw59aa	I'd consider Canon, Nikon, and Pentax (listed alphabetically, not in order of preference).  For your price range, you're looking at their entry level DSLR kits with a lens or two.  Like the Canon EOS 1000D, the Nikon D60, or the Pentax K2000.<br>  <br>  Do you have any lenses available to you already?  Family, friends, etc?  What mount?  Could determine the path you take.<br>  <br>  Does the college have any camera recommendations?|`|saYkDVGlaa	There are several good cameras in that range.  Since you have found your price range, remember to subtract enough from your total budget for memory cards, extra batteries etc.  Then, go look at the cameras from all brands within your range.  Go to a camera shop where someone can answer your questions like a photographer, not a high school kid in a big box store.  Handle them and figure out how the buttons and dials fit your hands.  Don't worry what they do yet, just how well you can operate them.  Then look for the best price on the model you prefer.  I personally shoot Canon because that's what I started with decades ago.  One final note, whatever brand you buy will probably be the one you use from there on because the lenses will follow you.  The different manufacturers have lenses made specifically for small sensor cameras.  Nikon for one, has the ability to use these lenses on some of their upper level cameras so you don't have to lose their use later if you upgrade.  Good luck on your decision and your education in photography.

These companies were dominating their industries like steel an oil and would commit illegal acts to put others out of business or they would just buy them.

LVpyaf48aa	the best advice anyone can give is this...<br>  amateurs dont advertise in the yellow pages. open the book and dial. call at least 5-6 different photographers. you will educate yourself and be able to compare real prices from real photographers in your area.<br>  <br>  here are a few tips...<br>  - be sure to ask for their website to see samples of their work.<br>  - myspace and facebook are for social networking, not running a business. seasoned pros will have a real dot com.<br>  - not all photographers have the equipment or skills needed to cover an event. ex... portrait photogs cant necessarily shoot a wedding.<br>  - ask when the photos will be available.<br>  - ask how the photos will be delivered (digital? mail? website?)<br>  - ask if there is an extra charge for prints.<br>  - ask how the photog will handle model releases.<br>  - get a Signed Contract that protects **YOU**. you have nothing without it.|`|GQemfOANaa	you could try www.photographers.com there you will be able to see photographers work and get contact numbers etc to discuss prices {which have huge differences}..to see whats best for you.|`|qXAvXHdYaa	It would depend on how many hours of coverage you need and the deliverables.<br>  <br>  Examples might be:<br>  4 hour party - do you need before and after coverage?  6 hours of coverage = $600<br>  Deliverables?<br>  Prints?  how many, what size? - prices can range from $5 - $25 per print depending on the size.<br>  Images on CD?  low res or high res and what will they be used for?  CD of images could cost you between $100 and $300 with additional usage fee for web usage based on size of image and length of use.<br>  There could also be travel costs/expenses that need covered as well.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do is to call up some event photographers and setup a meeting.  Look at their portfolios and let them know what you are looking for.  They should be able to give you a quote.<br>  <br>  Prices also vary depending on the market and photographer skill level.

7Srd7Pliaa	Without knowing how the specular highlights look, you have a couple of options.  You can make the picture look as if it were soft lighted by dodging, or you can darken the highlight using burning.  Usually specular highlights are relatively small areas of brightness, so it would be easier to "relight" the picture so the small highlight doesn't look so noticeable.<br>  <br>  Essentially, you will always start by adding a new layer.  If you use the color picker, you can fill in the highlight area with that color.  You'll want to use the "Color" blending so that the luminosity is not affected.  Alternatively, you can feather the selection and fill it in with black (feathering helps smooth out the edges so that it doesn't look so noticeable).  In this case you'll use the "Burn" blending so that the highlight gets darker.  Play with the opacity of the layer so that it doesn't become too noticeable.<br>  <br>  To go the "relighting" route, you would select a larger area, and use a radial gradient (so that the white is in the middle and it gets darker as you get farther from the center).  Use the "Dodge" blending and play with the opacity to taste.<br>  <br>  You may have to use a combination of all these techniques to get it the way you like.  Hopefully this gives you some ideas.|`|dai4nP0yaa	Interesting question. If there was a little detail left in the highlights, I would probably use a layer mask and paint them out. Otherwise cloning the skin would be my second choice. Ofcourse either way you have to adjust the opacity and play around with it so it's not noticeable. <br>  <br>  I know the explanation probably sounds a little unclear but I tend to do my editing on a case by case basis. I usually tend to understand the mechanics of each procedure and then make my own adjustments to them depending on the picture.|`|xcw4EBalaa	It's usually a combination of either the patch or clone tool (to cover), then the heal tool - not spot heal! - to blend your patch into the surrounding area.<br>  <br>  Soften or harden the edges of your heal tool to work best with the size of the brush.
draNVjbkaa	AGENTS<br>  To get an agent, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  <br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too.<br>  -Attend a showcase and impress them. By showcase I do not mean scammy conventions like IMTA, Proscout, or Best New Talent. I mean legit ones like at TVI, Reel pros, etc.<br>  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in<br>  <br>  DON'T<br>  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!<br>  -Sign with them if they ask for upfront money, make you take new photos with THEIR photographer, or take THEIR classes. Agent's ONLY make money when you do. Agents usually make 10% on film/tv and commercials and 20% on commercial print<br>  <br>  There are FAKE agencies like John Casablancas, Barbizon, and JRP. John Casablancas, Barbizon and John Robert Powers are all SCAMS! They are NOT agencies! LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print). REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises.<br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.<br>  <br>  These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable and REPUTABLE schools like Howard Fine Studios, Ivanna Chubbuck, TVI Studios, Groundlings, Second City, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W.

7uffHRdkaa	Do you mean by citizenship, culture or ancestry? If your mother was born and raised in Germany, assuming it wasn't on a U.S. military base, it'd make her a German citizen. If she were born on a base, she'd technically be born in America. If you're not a German citizen, that could actually qualify you for dual citizen with Germany.<br>  <br>  By ancestry, if your father's of German ancestry, which 1/6 of American's are, it'd make your ethnically more than 50% German. I don't know what your father's ancestry is though. But he'd be American culturally, not German. Now does this make you German? I don't know. It depends. Do you speak German? Do you visit Germany a lot? Do you visit family there? If so, I'd say you have a connection to your ancestry.<br>  <br>  This obviously isn't the normal case for most German-Americans though. Most German-Americans have ancestry that dates back to immigrants from the 1800's, especially Bavaria. When most Germans immigrated to America, the idea of Germany as a unified country really didn't even exist.<br>  <br>  In modern day, there's a lot of German citizens who aren't of German ancestry, either because of Europeans moving around, or immigrants from other parts of the world, so being ''German'' wouldn't necessarily mean ethnicity.

a3C6DeNeaa	You picked the wrong type of camera. I wanted to do stop motion why my Sony digital camera, and there is NO remote capture software available for point and shoot Sony's. I called their tech support and everything. You're much better of using a camcorder or webcam since it'll be recognized up by stop motion programs easily.<br>  <br>  The problem is that most digital cameras (even DSLR's with a live view) can't be used with stop motion software since they all go into a "generic hard drive" mode for uploading pics when plugged into a computer. That's why stop motion programs can't detect your camera; it's not made to provide a live video feed when plugged into a computer.

If you could actually find all 128 of your 5th great grandparents,  you could ad dup those 1/128ths, which are 0,78125% each, and say you were 47/128ths English. 31/128 Hguenot,1/128th Cherokee . . .<br>  <br>  But, many of our ancestors were tight-lipped about where they came from or why, especially the ones who ended up making their homes 6 ridges west of the law in what is now West Virginia.<br>  <br>  You find the percentage by dividing; 1/2 = 50%, 1/8th - 12.5% and so on. You are half of your mom and half of your dad. If you mom is 1/8th something, you are 1/16th of it.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	You find out by tracing your family members, and locating the place of birth. IF each of your grandparents were the immigrants.. 1 from Germany, one from Ireland, one from Scotland, one from Japan.. then you would be 1/4th of each of those (25%.. I find it easier to use fractions). <br>  Obviously, few of us have ancestors that simple. However, when you use reliable documentation.. then you DO know exactly who came from where. <br>  And most of us in the US are mutts, so this is pretty standard. <br>  <a href="http://rwguide.rootsweb.ancestry.com/" rel="nofollow">http://rwguide.rootsweb.ancestry.com/</a><br>  something to help you get going on the process. Living persons will not normally be online, so the preliminary part of research will be within family members, and records that you have authority to have.|`|Wkosntqgaa	i have no idea. sorry.it just doesn't make sense|`|7uffHRdkaa	To find the percentage of your ancestry, you go by fractions. The benefit to tracing your ancestry is that groups like Ukrnians, Italians and Polish don't really trace far back before the late-1800's, for the most part, so there's only so many generations you'd be able to divide for. First, find out which parent is of which ancestry. Than find out which grandparent is of which ancestry. They're surname should be able to give you some indication, if they're not exactly sure. I'll explain to you how I'd figure out the percentages of my ancestry, to give you a model.<br>  <br>  My dad's entire side is of Italian ancestry, so that one was pretty easy. My mom's side is more tricky though. On my maternal grandmother's side, both of her parents were born in the U.S.Out of 4 grandparents though, 2 were foreign born. Her grandfather was born in Spain, sometimes during the mid-to-late 1800's, and her mother was born in Ireland. Both moved to America and met eachother. Her other set of grandparents were both Amercian born peropld of Irish background, who's parents and I believe grandparents were also born in the U.S., but I'm having trouble dating back before that. So that'd make my grandmother 75% Irish and 25% Spanish.<br>  <br>  On my mom's paternal side, she's mixed of Irish and English. Her father's father was full Irish (Catholic). Her father's mother was 50% Irish and 50% English. The English side was Episcopalian. All of his parents, grandparents and great-grandparents were born in the U.S., but I can't trace before that. So what I know is my grandfather is 75% Irish and 25% English.<br>  <br>  So how does that break down for my mom? It'd make my mom 75% Irish, since both of her parents are 75% Irish. It'd make her 1/8 Spanish and 1/8 English, because both of her parents are one-quarter of each of that, so you'd divide it by two. That would mean I'd have to divide it by 2 for my ancestry. That'd make me 1/2 Italian, 3/8 Irish, 1/16 Spanish, 1/16 English. Or 50% Italian, 37.5% Irish, 6.25% Spanish, 6.25% English.<br>  <br>  When you break down numbers smaller and smaller, they tend to mean less, but it's still not bad to know. In my opinion, it's good to know, because it keeps your family ancestry organized. This is definitely where the benefit of taking a Statistics course in college comes in.|`|0HAn67yZaa	you have to find out how far down the line you had a purebred ancestor and what relation it was to you and then you have to divide.<br>  <br>  take me as an example.<br>  i have american indian in me.<br>  my great great great grandmother was 100%.<br>  so that means my great great grandmother was 50%<br>  my great grandmother was 25%<br>  my grandmother was 12.5%<br>  my dad is 6%.<br>  so that makes me 3%.<br>  <br>  <br>  i also have english, scottish, croatian, french, french canadian, german, pennsylvania dutch, czech/bohemian heritage.<br>  <br>  i have bohemian on every side of my family, but i havn't figured out how much of each heritage i am yet, all i know is you break it down and divide it.

Today we are exhorted to not question these themes and warned that we are somehow “anit-semitic” if we do. Examination and discussion of these keywords are considered “hate speech” and against the law in many nations where Jews have pressed for such laws. Recognizing that we are being told to not look there, we know exactly where to look to see what is behind the propaganda curtain of illusion.<br>  <br>  Rabbi Stephen S. Wise was the major leadership figure of the American Jewish Congress during its formative period. Born in Hungary, the son of a Rabbi and a porcelain heiress and the grandson of Joseph Hirsch Weisz, a Grand Rabbi of Hungary, he was brought to New York by his parents as a small child in 1875, when his father became rabbi of a Brooklyn, New York, congregation. The younger Wise was instructed in Talmudic law by his father and the Rev. Dr. Gustav Gotheil. He attended the College of the City of New York, and was reported to have completed his studies abroad. After returning to the United States, at the age of 20, he was elected rabbi of the Congregation B'nai Jeshurun in New York where he remained for over five years. Shortly after June of 1900, he went to Portland, Oregon, to head up a congregation and then returned to New York, founding the Free Synagogue in 1906. Early on, Dr. Wise was known for his progressive ideas on general topics and also as an exponent of Zionism, a movement then contemplating the reestablishment of the Jewish nation. <br>  <br>  As early as 1900, Wise is recorded telling a Zionist gathering that "<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.real-debt-elimination.com/real_freedom/Propaganda/holocaust/origin_of_holocaust_propaganda.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.real-debt-elimination.com/rea...</a>

qDYzdz5daa	The First Assumption is always that you assume that your senses are not decieving you, and that you and the world you percieve are real.<br>  <br>  If you reject this assumption, then one of two things happens:<br>  <br>  1. You become paralyzed by doubt and unable to function.<br>  <br>  2. You act a fool because you don't believe that your actions have consequences.<br>  <br>  Where you use guesses, I would use "likelihoods."  If educated, our guesses are built upon the likelihood that what happened in the past will continue to happen in the same way in the future.  Absolute certainty is impossible, but reasonable, even overwhelming, certainty is not.  At some point, the patterns become so well-established that expecting other outcomes becomes fruitless, and the world becomes predictable.|`|xuCY36yWaa	I SEE WHERE YOU ARE GOING,HOWEVER MUCH TO DEEP FOR ME.

TNE6uFkTaa	There was no credit. You paid in cash or with goods or did without.. People did not have credit cards those came along in the 1950s.Prior to the Great Depression you could get a mortgage but you had to have lots of money down. By the way after WWII you could only buy large items such as stoves/houses/cars etc in Canada by paying one third of the cost in cash first. Maybe we should go back to that idea. It certainly would save a lot of credit card debt and a lot of people would be less likely to buy things they really didn't need or could afford.

2kV8WdYUaa	Ballet is a dance of discipline.  It helps the body use muscles you never thought you had.  Listen, you may have big boobs,but find you a real good dance bra and strap them down good.  Stretch everyday, even the days you don't want to you have to. Take walks and feel take in that burning feeling when your stretching.  Cause honey if you don't feel the burn then your not stretching right.  That what i tell my students.  Don't you worry about the weight, because its going to come off.  You just got to keep pushing yourself it you want this badly.  You will tone up if you keep trying.  Good luck my dear|`|EZHXhsLTaa	i'm going to be outright honest and say that you're getting into a dangerous zone. I'm about the same size as you and have the same type of self-image issues that it seems like you're facing. <br>  <br>  the truth is...I tried diets. they just make a person weaker. my ballet teacher always tells me, "willow trees aren't the only ballerinas." This means that each dancer is beautiful no matter what they look like. <br>  <br>  Eat healthy. If you're not going to eat meat, you need a source of protein. (nuts, etc.) You need fruits and vegetables, carbs/grains/breads, and dairy. Balance out your eating with your exercise to keep healthy. If you asked any health professional, they would tell you that you shouldn't be losing any weight at all. Actually, if you get up to 110 you WILL find that you are a better and stronger dancer. It happened to me and it can happen to you too. <br>  <br>  But please don't get the idea that losing weight will help you be a better dancer. Because it WONT.|`|UKNTYisAaa	most probably<br>  but your average<br>  and just right|`|0343bVdnaa	I think if you're more comfortable with your weight, then you'll dance better. You'd probably also be better to move better because the extra weight won't be slowing you down. However, don't let the diet and exercise take over your life. Be healthy ans smart about your work outs and diet. <br>  Good Luck :]

It involved Castro (who had a grudge after finding out the CIA was behind the Bay of Pigs Invastion) so he got a patsy (Oswald) from the Russians to carry-out the deed. Marcello's beef was a result of RFK's investigations into organized crime. To cover the link to the Mafia, Marcello had Jack Ruby (a two bit night club owner in the Marcello organization) take out Oswald to seal his lips.<br>  <br>  Giancana's beef with JFK was his impression that JFK renigged on promises to leave the Mafia alone since he felt he pulled strings in Chicago to get him elected. <br>  <br>  Several weeks before the assassination, Oswald met with Cuban agents in Mexico. For inexplicable reasons, the FBI agents who were following up the Cuban connection as a part of the Warren Commission investigation, were recalled

You need to go through the book and make notes of relevant items as you go along.<br>  <br>  In general, the effect of any writer's imagery is to make things come alive for the reader by enabling him or her to visualize the details of the setting and characters.  And Imagery need not be visual.  Images can also involve the other senses, so other sensory impressions that Harper Lee conveys are also examples of imagery.|`|gFWteXugaa	have you checked spark notes?
xjBFwsVMaa	Draw the outlines and then shade it.<br>  <br>  Choose the right colour you are going to use for your chalk pastels.Using chalk pastels is a little like watercolours. The more chalk you use the darker it looks and the lighter it is the less you need. Start by covering the desire area , do not colour in all of it but rather leave marking to blend in later. The darker ones are coloured in more first and the lighters are only briefly touched upon. <br>  Step3Blend the colour with your index finger, commencing with the " darkest" and most coloured in parts first and disperse it towards the other parts of your drawing. Remember to clean your fingers every so often to avoid creating an undesirable effect. <br>  Step4Apply the pastel pencils for the small details you have left unfinished.. If you make mistakes you can always erase it or smudge it out. <br>  Step5Finish the drawing by applying hairspray evenly throughout the drawing. Do not be alarmed if the painting appears darker than it was, this is only natural. Place the drawing on a dry area and allow to dry for about two hours. If you still feel the need to go back and give the drawing more details, bear in mind that you have to hair spray the paintings again when you are finished.

But to be on the safe side i only about 5 minutes or so and make him take drinks of water just in case he was sick or anything like that. But you should ask the parents of any medical conditions especially if he gets dizzy easily. Another tip is make sure you wait 1 hour before tickling him after he eats.

This will make them laugh and giggle but it can't hurt them. When the child's laughter turns to a almost crying sound, then you know to stop.

Be sure to stop immediately because you do not want to hurt or upset the child but until this happens they will be fine with being tickled and they will laugh.|`|l2IYzaWPaa	when i was little my older sisters use to tickle me until i couldn't breath. they thought it was the funniest thing ever. well that's until i broke one of their noses! still to this day if some one tries to tickle me i will sock them. so if you want to screw this kid up for life, then go for it have your fun at his expense!|`|nx7QtF0paa	this has got to be the oddest question, but funny... tickle him until he starts to beg you to stop... he might pee...  go for the spot on the sides of the knees and squeeze but not to tight... the ribs are good too  <br>  <br>  notice I didn't say you couldn't tickle him again and again :)|`|c0fded412e2f6885dbe299e7d76531f3aa	You should not tickle a child -- it borders on physical abuse.

shVgCizBaa	Battles of Lexington and Concord<br>  The Battles of Lexington and Concord were the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War.[8] They were fought on April 19, 1775, in Middlesex County, Province of Massachusetts Bay, within the towns of Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, Menotomy (present-day Arlington), and Cambridge, near Boston. The battles marked the outbreak of open armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in the mainland of British North America.<br>  <br>  About 700 British Army regulars, under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith, were given secret orders to capture and destroy military supplies that were reportedly stored by the Massachusetts militia at Concord. Through effective intelligence gathering, Patriot colonials had received word weeks before the expedition that their supplies might be at risk, and had moved most of them to other locations. They also received details about British plans on the night before the battle, and were able to rapidly notify the area militias of the military movement.<br>  <br>  The first shots were fired just as the sun was rising at Lexington. The militia were outnumbered and fell back, and the regulars proceeded on to Concord, where they searched for the supplies. At the North Bridge in Concord, several hundred militiamen fought and defeated three companies of the King's troops. The outnumbered regulars fell back from the Minutemen after a pitched battle in open territory.<br>  <br>  More Minutemen arrived soon thereafter and inflicted heavy damage on the regulars as they marched back towards Boston. Upon returning to Lexington, Smith's expedition was rescued by reinforcements under Earl Hugh Percy. A combined force of about 1,700 men marched back to Boston under heavy fire in a tactical withdrawal and eventually reached the safety of Charlestown. The accumulated militias blockaded the narrow land accesses to Charlestown and Boston, starting the Siege of Boston.<br>  Aftermath<br>  In the morning, Boston was surrounded by a huge militia army, numbering over 15,000, which had marched from throughout New England.[89] This time, unlike during the Powder Alarm, the rumors of spilled blood were true, and the Revolutionary War had begun. The militia army continued to grow as surrounding colonies sent men and supplies. The Second Continental Congress adopted these men into the beginnings of the Continental Army. Even now, after open warfare had started, Gage still refused to impose martial law in Boston. He persuaded the town's selectmen to surrender all private weapons in return for promising that any inhabitant could leave town.[90]<br>  <br>  The battle was not a major one in terms of tactics or casualties. However, in terms of supporting the British political strategy behind the Intolerable Acts and the military strategy behind the Powder Alarms, the battle was a significant failure because the expedition contributed to the fighting it was intended to prevent, and because few weapons were actually seized.[82]<br>  <br>  The actual fighting was followed by a war for British political opinion. Within four days of the battle, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress had collected scores of sworn testimonies from militiamen and from British prisoners. When word leaked out a week after the battle that Gage was sending his official description of events to London, the Provincial Congress sent over 100 of these detailed depositions on a faster ship. They were presented to a sympathetic official and printed by the London newspapers two weeks before Gage's report arrived.[89] Gage's official report was too vague on particulars to influence anyone's opinion. George Germain, no friend of the colonists, wrote, "the Bostonians are in the right to make the King's troops the aggressors and claim a victory."[91] Politicians in London tended to blame Gage for the conflict instead of their own policies and instructions. The British troops in Boston variously blamed General Gage and Colonel Smith for the failures at Lexington and Concord.[92]<br>  <br>                   Legacy<br>  It was important to the early American government that an image of British fault and American innocence be maintained for this first battle of the war. The history of Patriot preparations, intelligence, warning signals, and uncertainty about the first shot was rarely discussed in the public sphere for decades. The story of the wounded British soldier at the North Bridge, hors de combat, struck down on the head by a Minuteman using a hatchet, the purported "scalping", was strongly suppressed. Depositions mentioning some of these activities were not published and were returned to the participants (this notably happened to Paul Revere[96]). Paintings portrayed the Lexington fight as an unjustified slaughter.[96]<br>  <br>  The issue of which side was to blame grew during the early nineteenth century. For example, older participants' testimony in later life about Lexington and Concord differed greatly from their depositions taken under o|`|SUL6Re4Aaa	Here are a few helpful websites

You could find pictures of people and nature and put them together, but it doesn't have to be perfectly put together because you could paint over it and meld the images better. Make sure not to make it perfect, do rough strokes to give it a more natural feel and if you want, you could do the same on top of the images to bring the image consistency.|`|xjBFwsVMaa	have an outline of a person with shapes making it up maybe start with it being a shape then growing it  until it actually looks like a person.<br>  <br>  make a creature out of basic shapes...<br>  <br>  You could always act like your little... and make picture out of all basic shapes and nothing else.|`|8ar7NAxdaa	make a collage<br>  <br>  use different images from anywhere that show life and put them together to represent a bigger picture.<br>  <br>  or cut out a bunch of different colorful shapes and shape them into a flower or something else that represents life<br>  <br>  good luck!

I think we could be extra nice and caring, setting aside our bad memories, we could share our thoughts and expand our understandings towards each other, maybe by then we would admire and respect our qualites, so we could be cooperative and become neighbors.<br>  <br>  My guess would be privacy and publicity, that could be political.  The area of differences could lead us into different fields generating our life styles and qualities that could be incompatible.  My point of view is to reunite our common nature that is to profit each other, seeking the harmony and eventually it would be our joy to cooperate into greater grains for our future in peace and stability, that would strenghten our grounds allows us to stand firm in our daily living with hope and prosprous.<br>  <br>  The truth is, in my opinion, the accelaration of the planet is causing the friction between atoms to vibrate, these tiny little space is reduced in stablity through biolchemical ways, in other word stress.  We are tired physically and metally, we need to settle our progress into a more effectioncy and convenient way.<br>  <br>  Let's just say we do our best to help preserve, protect and maintain the planet, our environment, our society, our love and understanding, our future.|`|VrR9ojRRaa	Everything anyone does you have to remember they always have an alternative motive.<br>  <br>  Everybody is 100% selfish!<br>  <br>  It's basic human behavior, even those who selflessly help others do so because it makes them feel good.

S3qsavTsaa	In "Twilight" when a vampire bites someone, they don't need to give the person they are biting blood of their own. In the book, vampires dont have blood, so that would be impossible anyway. When they bite someone, the injects their venom into the person's bloodstream, and it slowly turns them into a vampire. And, even if the vampires, had blood to give, you wouldnt be able to get to it anyway without another vampire there to rip them apart because their skin is as hard as marble.|`|7eEEIJlcaa	i love twilight!!! haha<br>  no the vampire just has to bite the human and then the transformation from human to vampire begins<br>  i hope this helps!|`|4RrzVNHRaa	No the only thing the vampire has to do is bite the victim.

f595f51912c467d68eab3d0fedf6e468aa	I've played a ukulele for nearly 50 years and never once have I seen bubbles in my strings. No, I doubt it's due to stretching. With the amount you're playing, it shouldn't take more than a few days for the strings to stretch to the point where they will stay in tune.<br>  <br>  I believe your uke came with defective strings and you should take it back, insist on new strings, and ask for help tuning it.<br>  <br>  Tuning has nothing to do with whether or not the strings are stretched. The stretch factor only affects how long it will stay in tune.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Kabum|`|MAqmVE7qaa	Little bubbles? Could be that they're Ernie Ball Elixir strings with a nylon coating. It will probably take 2-3 days for them to fully set in, or about 25 hrs of playing time. Believe me I go through a set of strings every 3-4 weeks, I'm always "wearing strings in"<br>  <br>  Some fine tuning is necessary almost every time you play the instrument. But if it is consistently falling out of tune, and pretty badly, you probably have cheap machine heads.

Christian artists used watercolor, and other mediums as well. I would go as far as to say that Christian artists invented oil painting medium. If you check the history of painting on canvas and oil painting you will see that the major work done at that time around 15th century is Christian in theme. Therefore I would say that yes they did use oil paints in their traditional painting. Jan van Eyck was a Christian and he is called the father of oil painting because he perfected oil painting techniques.

Finally there were several all-black or predominately-black units in Confederate armies or local defense forces. All three categories of black Confederates appeared at Gettysburg. "...And after the battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, ...reported among the rebel prisoners were seven blacks in Confederate uniforms fully armed as soldiers..."<br>  <br>  - New York Herald, July 11, 1863.<br>  One scholar has estimated that up to 25% (65,000 out of 261,000) of free Blacks in the South and 15% (600,000 out of 4 million) of slaves sided with the South at one time during the war. To imagine the Confederate armies without black Southerners in their ranks to perpetuate the historical myth of the South as a compartmentalized society. It ignores the real relationship between blacks and whites in the Old South, as well as the role and experiences of a small but significant portion of black Southerners in the Confederacy.<br>   It is estimated that over 65,000 Southern blacks were in the Confederate ranks. Over 13,000 of these, "saw the elephant" also known as meeting the enemy in combat. These Black Confederates included both slave and free.

XvO4iLk0aa	G Do the dump of delsions. Drop the consciousness slop. Fly in the sky with the reasons why. Build your great way with the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be one’s decisions based on clarity, That means dumping the guesses and agendas and focusing on what is verifiably pragmatic<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

R5UIMBvcaa	To me, Jocasta has relatively little freedom and thus has little opportunity to make the choices that bring her fate upon her.  We don't know that she actively agreed to have her newborn baby abandoned to die, and it seems reasonable to suppose that she was unhappy about it but acquiesced.  We also don't know how much choice she had about marrying Oedipus.  Although they seem happy together, she was probably part of the deal when the grateful people of Thebes offered to make him king.  All in all, Jocasta seems to be a passive victim of fate, a pathetic character rather than a truly tragic one.<br>  <br>  As for temper, she seems to have very little.  The closest we see to an indication of it is her indignation when, hearing people shouting, she comes out of the palace to find her husband and her brother about to get into a fight.  (The words with which she breaks it up, which amount to "Oedipus, come in the house; Creon, go home" may provoke a shuddery laugh.)<br>  <br>  All in all, Jocasta seems to be a passive victim of fate, a pathetic character rather than a truly tragic one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oedipus, on the other hand, makes conscious decisions that bring his fate upon him.  Although he is quite intelligent (like his mother, who sees before he does where his investigation is leading), at some critical times, he simply fails to think.  Having just been warned by the oracle that he will kill his father, he seems to forget that the reason he want to Delphi in the first place was to learn whether the people he thought were his parents really were, and evidently within the day he kills an older man.   Not long thereafter, despite having also been warned that he will marry his mother, he marries an older woman.  One would think that anyone in his situation would avoid any interaction with people old enough to be his parents, but no.  <br>  <br>  If he inherited his mother's intelligence, he also inherited his father's temper.  Laius provokes the fight that leads to his death by striking at Oedipus with his carriage whip, and Oedipus, having recently been told something no one would want to hear, loses control and kills Laius and (he thinks) his whole party.  Then in the play itself, when Teiresias, evidently trying to protect him from the knowledge, refuses to tell him who killed Laius, he again loses his temper and shouts preposterous accusations and taunts, which in the next episode (act) he extends to Creon, who has had nothing to do with the matter beyond going to Delphi for him.  (It's at this point that Jocasta comes out to break it up.)  And in the final episode, he again blows up when the old servant stalls over telling him where he got the baby he gave to the man from Corinth years earlier, and even threatens the old man with torture.<br>  <br>  So although it may seem on the surface that Oedipus is as much a victim of an inexorable fate as is Jocasta, in fact he brings that fate on both of them through the decisions he makes.|`|zBr9MSY7aa	Ok, Oedipus is the one who has the "blind" rage throughout the play.  One example is when he is approached by the seer, misinterprets his warning and then assaults him with an irrational barrage of insults.  The interaction between Jocasta and Oedipus is ironic throughout the play, look carefully and you will see the word play and hinting of Oedipus really being her son.  Freedom is only achieved by Oedipus once he gouges his eyes out and thus becomes the physically incarnation of his tragic flaw (blindness of rationality).

TMzRnWv3aa	I don't know how the previous person is shipping their work, but no way should it cost $50 to $200.  My husband is an artist, and I do all of his shipping.  Please make sure it is completely dry before packaging.  If you are shipping it framed, you can reuse the package your frame came in (if you had it shipped to you).  Framing companies have good packages for reusing.  You could also look into strongboxes, which can be expensive.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest getting two sheets of foam core, cut about 1/2" to 1" larger around than the frame, or painting if unframed.  Place on either side of the painting, then wrap in two layers of bubble wrap and tape with packaging tape to hold.  Possibly another layer of foam core.  I would put bubble wrap, styrofoam, or newspaper around the sides, and make sure it cannot shift around.  Some people package like said in a box, and place that inside a larger box.  After you figure out how large it will be with the packaging materials, you will know what size box you will need (if you aren't reusing the frame packaging).  I keep all my frame boxes and reuse them.  It probably won't weigh more than 8 lbs.  Go to fedex, ups, and usps websites and do their shipping calculators to estimate the cost.  Don't forget the insurance value and for a delivery confirmation if using USPS, and make sure the package is marked fragile.  It shouldn't cost more than $25 to $35, but it will depend on package size, weight, and ship to/from addresses.|`|3XNUUfFyaa	It depends where you are sending it from and where to. But if you are sending it inside US it should be around $50-$200 not including insurance.Insurance depends on how much insurance you want. With packaging I would go to the UPS store and get the professionals to pack it. They usually use an oversize box and pack it with the styrofoam things and bubble wrap. It costs for package mail around $5 from NY to CA for a 8lb package but than you have the packing material and its weight to consider.

Going fast could be something like: The male/female could immediately start flirting with the opposing character, and the opposing characters could not be interested until something significant. But I like the gradual, slow progression. <br>  <br>  To make it possible: They could be on something that makes them pose as husband/wife or girlfriend/boyfriend. If they're in high school, maybe the girl got assigned to the boy or vice versa for an assignment (or more fantasy-like, like in Vampire Academy) or a grade (in Vampire Academy, the half-vampires got assigned to "protect" real vampires for a grade to move on and be gaurdians). <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

shVgCizBaa	Fashion icon<br>      Jacqueline Kennedy became a symbol of fashion for women all over the world. She set the style for the early sixties with her clean suits, sleeveless A-line dresses and the pillbox hat that she often wore. In the years after the White House, her style changed dramatically. Gone were the modest "campaign wife" clothes. The styles were changing and she certainly did not want to be stuck in the past. She set styles just as she did as the president's wife, but this time the clothes were different. Wide-leg pantsuits, blue jeans, large lapel jackets, silk Hermes head scarves and of course those large, round, dark sunglasses were her new look. She also experimented with different styles, sometimes wearing lots of jewelry, gypsy skirts, and hoop earrings with her hair pulled back. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis has been called one of the most influential women in fashion.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_...</a>

BBfIXcI0aa	The point of pornography is to arouse - there isn't a plot, or if there is, it's a minor one that solely serves to go between sex scenes. In pornography, you view the actors' bodies actually performing intimate acts. Kissing is never pornography - there's no skin showing. Sex isn't always pornography, because it can be done in an artistic way. But when people start paying special attention to each other's body parts without any subtlety on the camera's parts, you can figure there's a line around there somewhere.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	To me porn means actual sex. An intimate scene in a movie, the actors are wearing body suits, memorizing lines, and its choreographed. Porn is purely ppl having sex on camera, there's a huge difference.|`|YDttUxrnaa	when their cock is in there mouth and asss

The United States, along with Canada, Great Britain, France, and Japan became entangled in the civil war which followed the Bolshevik revolution. It was World War I and the Soviet government had negotiated a peace treaty with Germany removing them from the war. America and its allies joined with the White Russians, who promised to stay in the war, to fight the Red Army.  <br>  The Allies feared that the major ports in northwest Russia--Murmansk and Archangel--would fall to Germany after Russia left the war. Millions of dollars of war supplies, mostly sent from the United States to Russia while they were still in the war, were stored in the docks and warehouses of Archangel. <br>  An allied force under British command was sent to Russia on August 3, 1918. They took the city of Archangel and pushed the Red Army (Bolshevik troops) south. At the request of the British, the United States sent a regiment to join the campaign. <br>  As the weather worsened, the troops fought through the winter in deep snow and intense cold against the Red Army, well after the fighting ceased on the Western Front in November. In May of 1919 American troops began to withdraw, replaced by fresh British troops and Russian White Army allies. <br>  The leader of the American troops felt that the operation was mismanaged, and his soldiers subjected to unnecessary hardships. This small force suffered over 400 casualties.<br>  To Americans, this campaign is a little known minor incident of World War I. But to the Russians, who had great pride in their ultimate victory, this was the "American invasion."

Or, have you been unable to finalize the contract due to a failure on their part? Was the contract between you and the couple or the mother who paid? It should be the mother to make it a valid contract, but you don't need to mention that ;).<br>  The best bet would be to let your attorney handle it and cease all personal communication with them (they made a threat). He should make it clear that threats of illegal actions preclude you from having further contact.

I think another important point, who signed your original contract?
