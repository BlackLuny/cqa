I myself have had 8 so far, over the last maybe 12 days since seeing the commercial. Unfortunately today I got 2 foot-longs at not my usual shop, and this guy makes'em a bit skimpy. He should really "pile them high" like they says in the commercial.      My normal subway store is right across the street from me, thank heavens. And they know how to make'em usually.       I typically get turkey or roast beef, each with lettuce, tomato, onion, green pepper, olives and cukes. With light mayo and spicy mustard sauce. I put on fresh ground pepper when I get home.       The turkey isn't as good a value, since normally it's 5.99. The roast beef however saves me twice as much since it's normally 6.99 here.      Yeah... I like them five dollar foot-longs. I stopped getting them for a while since the only $5 subs were ones I didn't care for. This 'any foot-long' promo was just meant for me though. I also like how the subs let me put off going to the grocery store for another day or two.      So yeah... the tally's 8 for me so far. What about yous???

20090220232133AAkDfoG	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Is anyone else with me on this?	Here is a list of questions I would like to see permanently banned from the Cooking & Recipes section of Food & Drink:      1) Which came first, the chicken or the egg?   2) What would you do for a Klondike Bar?   3) How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?   4) What should I make for dinner (or breakfast, or lunch, or snack time)?  [How would anyone else know the answer to this question?]      They are a waste of time and bandwidth.  They may have been funny the first time they were posted, but by the twenty- or thirty-thousandth time, the humor escapes me.   Whenever I read one of these questions, I shall insert a line of z's, to indicate A) My boredom with reading the same un-funny question over and over again: and B) My desire to physically remove the question from this forum, like a buzz saw cutting a rotten branch off of a tree.   Is anyone else with me on this, or am I over-reacting?
