I disagree. I happen to be lucky enough to be close friends with all four of the boys, and I think their new sound is just as awesome as their old sound. Different, yes, but still pretty freakin' awesome. I am definately FOBsessed and I don't intend to change anytime soon! =) Rock on!|`|AA11541285	The thing is not of LIKING the band or musicians, the point is that in one album you have their style which many of the fans are accustomed to be hearing and enjoying, so they like listening to that type of music and band/musician from there on, thus becoming a fan.     For example think of the band Evanescence, I, personally am a fan of their music and lyrics, liking how the songs can be as quite as a whisper or as loud as a concert, but if they decide that they need a style there's a fifty-fifty chance.    The fifty-fifty chance being that the fans could hate it, and lose interest in their music, and sales for the band and fame go crashing down to the ground. (Like how Britney Spears fans are going down on her for her new reckless "habits", Britney saying she was going to make a "hot come back") or the other part being they like it and continue to listen/ become more interested in the band and their music.     That is basically taking a leap for more popularity, sales of albums and cds, fans, and world fame.

I actually cried over this in the past, but I have finally been able to let it go (although I can't make myself delete the final episode from my TIVO).  Here's what happened:  Everwood was one of the WB's most popular shows.  UPN and the WB merged to form a new network called the CW.  Because of this, half the shows had to be sliced from the lineup.  Dawn Ostroff (in charge of programming) had Everwood tentatively scheduled.  The WB announced the SERIES finale of 7th HEAVEN for which millions of viewers tuned in.  This made them think they were letting go of a goldmine, so the resurrected 7th HEAVEN from the dead for another season and cancelled EVERWOOD despite MASSIVE campaigns from fans to save the show.  See www.everwoodonline.com.    It truly was the greatest show ever.|`|69c0ca178d02931c49e7286c1697c69baa	There will be no new season of Everwood. Unfortunatly the CW network did not pick it up when they combined the stations.

f8f1942400aac1f22111db66513b84bbaa	Is it Bryan Adams, Matt Redman, or Hanson?   Here's the lyrics to them.      Bryan Adams-Never let go    Can you lay your life down, so a stranger can live?  Can you take what you need, but take less than you give?  Could you close every day, without the glory and fame?  Could you hold your head high, when no-one knows your name?  That's how legends are made, at least that's what they say.    We say goodbye, but never let go.  We live, we die, 'coz you can't save every soul.  Gotta take every chance to, show that you're the kinda man who;  Will never look back, never look down,  and never let go.    Can you lose everything, you ever had planned?  Can you sit down again, and play another hand?  Could you risk everything, for the chance of being alone?  Under pressure find the grace, or would you come undone?  That's how legends are made, at least that's what they say?    We say goodbye, but never let go.  We live, we die, 'coz you can't save every soul.  Gotta take every chance to, show that you're the kinda man who;  Will never look back, never look down,  and never let go.    Gotta take every chance to, show that you're the kinda man who;  Will never look back, never look down,  and never let go.    We say goodbye, but never let go.  We live, we die, 'but you can't save every soul.  Gotta take every chance to, show that you're the kinda man who;  Will never look back, never look down,  and never let go.    Will never look back, never look down,  and never let go.      Matt Redman-You never let go    Even though I walk through the valley   of the shadow of death  Your perfect love is casting out fear  And even when Im caught in the middle   of the storms of this life  I wont turn back  I know You are near    And I will fear no evil  For my God is with me  And if my God is with me  Whom then shall I fear?  Whom then shall I fear?    Chorus:  Oh no, You never let go  Through the calm and through the storm  Oh no, You never let go  In every high and every low  Oh no, You never let go  Lord, You never let go of me    And I can see a light   that is coming for the heart that holds on  A glorious light beyond all compare  And there will be an end to these troubles  But until that day comes  Well live to know You here on the earth    Chorus:    Yes, I can see a light   that is coming for the heart that holds on  And there will be an end to these troubles   But until that day comes  Still I will praise You, still I will praise You    Chorus: (2xs)      Hanson-Never let go    Just lay down  and let your worries sleep  Don't think now  the water's dark and deep  'Cause you know that I love you and never let go  And you know that I'll love you forever  I love you and never let go  Yes I love you and never let go  Just cry out  yeah I've cried those tears before  I can feel it now  as your teardrops hit the floor  'Cause you know that I love you and never let go  and you know that I'll love you forever  I'll love you and never let go  Yes I love you and never let go  You are wrong to ask do I love you  as I hold you shows how much I do  I'm yours until  forever ends  Everytime I stand for you  I know I laid my life down for you  Never let,never let go      Hope these will help.|`|1aee9196e19b183947c5fd70d396dd1daa	sorry i can't tell you much about it.

c170d57a45684b48932ea007b3425f60aa	Birches by Robert Frost|`|17orTrcRaa	Birches            When I see birches bend to left and right  Across the lines of straighter darker trees,  I like to think some boy's been swinging them.  But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.  Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them  Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning  After a rain. They click upon themselves  As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured  As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.  Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells  Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust  Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away  You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.  They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,  And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed  So low for long, they never right themselves:  You may see their trunks arching in the woods  Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground,  Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair  Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.  But I was going to say when Truth broke in  With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm,  I should prefer to have some boy bend them  As he went out and in to fetch the cows--  Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,  Whose only play was what he found himself,  Summer or winter, and could play alone.  One by one he subdued his father's trees  By riding them down over and over again  Until he took the stiffness out of them,  And not one but hung limp, not one was left  For him to conquer. He learned all there was  To learn about not launching out too soon  And so not carrying the tree away  Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise  To the top branches, climbing carefully  With the same pains you use to fill a cup  Up to the brim, and even above the brim.  Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,  Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.  So was I once myself a swinger of birches.  And so I dream of going back to be.  It's when I'm weary of considerations,  And life is too much like a pathless wood  Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs  Broken across it, and one eye is weeping  From a twig's having lashed across it open.  I'd like to get away from earth awhile  And then come back to it and begin over.  May no fate willfully misunderstand me  And half grant what I wish and snatch me away  Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:  I don't know where it's likely to go better.  I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree  And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk  Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,  But dipped its top and set me down again.  That would be good both going and coming back.  One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.     Robert Frost

Porque ?de qu se trata BABEL? Practicamente es la historia de un director que viaja alrededor del mundo para hacer una pelcula que tenga alguna referencia al pasaje bblico del mismo nombre ?no?. Ora, toda esa efusin noticiosa en cuanto al nmero de Oscares que Inrritu va a ganar es cosa de la prensa, y nosotros como mexicanos no tenemos que sentirnos agredidos, o envidiarle, o sentir que nos quitan algo porque Mxico va a ganar en los Oscares. Ora que t no le des importancia a ese tipo de eventos a donde llegan las actrices super guapsimas y los actores y toda la parafernalia que Hollywood construye en torno a la codiciada presea ya es harina de otra costal. Porque se dice que los verdaderos due?os de Hollywood la industria son judos. Y si el pueblo de Mxico se siente agredido por la premiacin de Gonzles I?rritu en Hollywood es por motivos religiosos ?no? porque todos somos cristianos y en realidad los due?os de la industria del cine conocida como Hollywood son los judos.|`|cfd894847b75fdc79cb1afbb885b5cb0aa	I?arritu no merececa ni estar nominado por dar la imagen del mexicano en ese nivel.

I THINK ANNA NICOLE MOM JUST WANT THE MONEY, WAS SHE EVEN AT HER GRANDSON FUNERAL|`|AA10717336	If you have seen any of the mothers interviews you would under stand why they didn't get along.The mother is just another of the money hungry people who are taking advantage of a persons death,and she should be ashamed of herself because no true mother acts like this.|`|oyE3iCDpaa	I think it was because her mom was abusive. Anna also claimed that her mother was jealous of her fame.|`|xQ9hQ45Eaa	uneducated judgmental born again hillbillys is from whence she came i think she was ashamed and that they pretty much disowned her early on and then expected her to do for them when she had money....the interviews ive seen of her mom tells me she is a piece of work for sure|`|AA12302661	Don't remember and don't care.|`|e605f9887918d9cdd45aa7d875e2fc2daa	She had something with her mom over one of her mom"s b/f's. They need to lay the lady to rest and tend to that baby. Oh and they need to feed the kid more then they have been. Who thought of a sexy baby? She needs to eat way more then she has been being fed.|`|aea695a82c7fdebee26d1e328fca8986aa	No idea.  The lives of celebrities don't interest me much. I'd rather deal with real people who have real problems|`|c7e5e4ec9757f2ec1fcaffe8ea9c4a36aa	maybe so she can get some publicity like all of the other leaches|`|11b5c61888f242667a7a593091dfebe8aa	maybe she did not want to admit that she looks just like her mom|`|AA10349376	I don't know. Go ask her! Oh, wait, she's dead...I forget...|`|AA11046778	Anna Nicole's mother went out and publicly said that she thought Anna Nicole or her boyfriend were the cause of Daniel's death.  I'd hate her too.|`|426bf46ab037c073a4d2251a5d6982a1aa	Maybe she was a crap of a mother like mine.|`|AA10233569	Maybe because her mom advised her not to sleep with everything that moves.    And she's trying to get her hands on the baby because a LOT of money comes with the baby.  I doubt she would bother, otherwise.|`|lTjuTXSIaa	Ana Nicole felt her family had betrayed her by bad mouthing her to the media just to get their 15 minutes of fame. Her mother obviously now wants 15 more minutes. I hope she doesn't get her way as Ana clearly wanted to be buried with her son Daniel in the Bahamas. It's the least she deserves.|`|XBTr54Onaa	her mom was probably a bitty! now that her daughter is famous she wants to look good. go back home and let things be!|`|f16efac06dbc033803527c5fcf14ab38aa	The way I heard it is that she,at some point in her life, did not want to be associated with her family.

P5ns1QUvaa	Count of Monte Cristo is a classic where he counts his days in prison.   Also, a more recent movie: Little Miss Sunshine, the son was counting the days until he could leave home to join the Air Force.  I also think Bridget Jones Diary had a count down, but I can't remember exactly what for.   I believe she was trying to quit smoking.|`|dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	The Count of Monte Cristo  Papillion    There is also a documentary from the BBC about the number 1 hosted by Terry Jones (Monty Python).

AA11769963	"Sonata in C Major K. 545" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  It is an intermediate level piano work that most students of classical piano had to learn.

Ws1rSDRyaa	I actually think that Masashi Kishimoto may make a 3rd series of Naruto. All the couples will actually be together (especially Naruto and Hinata).     Here's what I'd hope to see from the end of Naruto Shippuden to Naruto 3:  Naruto Shippuden: Sasuke goes back to his team and their new mission is find something that will eventually remove the cursed seal from himself and Anko...  Naruto 3: Sasuke's cursed seal is inactive for some time (they're still searching for that something) until...and it gets really out of hand...    ...I'm not saying anything else 'cause I feel like it, except that this is gonna be one wild and twisted plot and it'll be really cool if something along these lines happens.|`|AA12298356	That would be pretty cool!!! :))|`|AA11992713	that would be cool.|`|TxPsGVoRaa	masashi kishimoto  yeah thatd be pretty cool  but it probably wouldnt be as good as the original story....|`|Sqqyl7T8aa	that wud be another story   and it will never end until the creator die!|`|Dzeq9QBzaa	that would be soooooo cooleo|`|lyaLkCIGaa	that would be cool cuz then we would see all of the couples together finally but the original naruto is still the best

QpBzgFQ9aa	Emo is a genre of rock music. Since its inception, emo has come to describe several independent variations of music, linked loosely but with common ancestry. As such, use of the term has been the subject of much debate.    In its original incarnation, the term emo was used to describe a subgenre of hardcore punk which originated in the Washington, DC music scene of the mid-1980s. In later years, the term emocore, short for "emotional hardcore", was also used to describe the DC scene and some of the regional scenes that spawned from it.|`|de9d6371340f86464936df2d1b513c93aa	emotional. but i dont believe all emo's are. i think its just more of a style, goth punk rock. just to be different|`|e37b05d109c87847dde299d23afc5d3faa	emotional|`|dbed0f4bfea4d70a8459015b785ceff2aa	Sister!|`|AA11999780	emotional. you know.

AA11166954	'Come Undone' by Duran Duran    Lyrics:  (written by duran duran)    Mine, immaculate dream, made breath and skin, Ive been waiting for you,  Signed, with a home tattoo, happy birthday to you was created for you.    (cant ever keep from falling apart.. at the seams)  (cant I believe youre taking my heart.. to pieces)    Ahh, itll take a little time, might take a little crime to come undone  Now well try to stay blind, to the hope and fear outside,  Hey child, stay wilder than the wind  And blow me in to cry.    Who do you need?   Who do you love?   When you come undone.    (chorus)    Words, playing me deja vu, like a radio tune I swear Ive heard before,  Chill, is it something real, or the magic Im feeding off your fingers    (cant ever keep from falling apart.. at the seams)  (can I believe youre taking my heart.. to pieces)    Lost, in a snow filled sky, well make it alright, to come undone,  Now well try to stay blind, to the hope and fear outside,  Hey child, stay wilder than the wind -  And blow me in to cry.

0e3d3703405d946948260502a32b5b26aa	Viene del 2 Tone, la segunda generacion del ska en los a?os 70's.  Blanco y ***** porque representa la union de las razas. Esto se dio porque despues de la independencia de jamaica, muchos jamiquinos emigraron a inglaterra. Habia jovenes ingleses que simpatizaban con los jovenes de los ghettos, ellos llevaron el ska de la primera ola y lo fusionaron, naciendo asi el 2 Tone y una segunda generacion de Rude Boys.  Esta bandera tambien simboliza el antiseximo, y pedia una igualdad en todos los aspectos.    El ska es muy viejo (1958) y han salido muchos subgeneros te los enlistare para que sepas como se les llamaba a cada grupo.    Ska Tradicional - Rude Boys (groseros)  Skinhead reaggae - Skinheads   2 Tone - Rude Boys (chicos rudos)  Oi - Skin Heads (Sharps o Rash)  3ra ola (Ska punk, ska jazz, fusion, latin,etc) - Skankers, skatos.
ttQESTuwaa	Aunque no es muy conocido an yo creo que uno de los mejores peleadores es TAK SAKAGUCHI.     Antes de ser actor de peliculas de accion realmente fue un peleador de la calle (Street Fighter) y era muy bien conocido por sus habilidades en las artes marciales adems de obtener una licencia de boxeo. En una entrevista con el director de cine Ryuhei Kitamura (uno de los amigos mas cercanos de Tak) dijo que haba peleado con un oso, un cocodrilo y un toro y que Tak haba resultado  ganador aunque esta info no me parece de lo ms segura, Kitamura san lo asegur y adems durante la filmacin de la pelicula Versus hizo sus propias escenas peligrosas que le costaron un diente, varias heridas y las costillas rotas, de lo ltimo no dijo nada por temor a que le impidieran seguir trabajando en las escenas peligrosas. Asi que creo que Tak Sakaguchi podria ganar una pelea facilmente sabiendo que tiene experiencia en situaciones reales.|`|1747cc43fb735925b289f514aad9793baa	Brucee Lee The Legendary Man with tthe Power of Dragon  pero esta muerto, creo que seria Jacquie Chan pues es muy habil y tambien hace sus propias escenas de riesgo.

I'm okay with that, I'd like to be a teacher for a while as well so I'm hoping to do a degree in English and French starting September. I know its really hard to be a successful writer so teaching is my back up plan and my parents are happy...I'd still do that if they weren't happy but it's nice to have some support. I'm 18 btw, I go to school in Ireland but I'm graduating in a few months :D

TGKjkKLSaa	Ok first yes try some local small venues. Small theaters, Local VFW, maybe a town fair stuff like that. Also make yourself a myspace, not the regular kind sign up as a artist. This will get you a bigger fan base. Bigger fan base = more venues taking notice due to requests. You might even be able to find some local fm, am or even online stations to get played on. Alot of online stations like the on here i work for play up and coming artists/bands all the time and sometimes even specialize in them.|`|AA11618519	Start wherever you want.   The path u take will find u, dont stress out on finding it.     ?|`|VDHIN90naa	what type of music? if your a rock band, playing at a cyber cafe probably isnt a good idea, because most of the people there are nerds and like techno music lol    It is generally better to start at smaller venues until your band has some recognition. This is very important especially when your starting gigging, and do not have much experience. Make sure you pack some backup equipment and make sure your guitarist brings extra strings and a multi tool! Theres nothing worse than breaking a string in the middle of a set and not being able to fix it. Very embarassing trust me.    Playing all of a sudden at a large venue might make the other bands think you are trying to outstage them, and might make you some enemies haha.

AA11827620	with my daughter I have been able to help her.  She does not always hit the correct notes but I took her to the piano and told her to hit the same note that I played.  At first I thought it was a loss hope but she came around and now can sing on key.  If it is something more than that I would try what my singing instructor told me to do... open your throat and yawn in a tone.  It sounds like a seal but you will get the idea of how you should open your mouth.  Before you go to sing try singing opera.  It will warm up your voice and your range will improve.  Also do not sing from your chest.  when you sing a note and then go to breathe if your chest rises then your singing from the wrong area.  Take a deep breath in your stomach, Push it out.  Then  hold it letting out a little at a time in a note.  you will learn first to control your length of holding out a note.  One other thing i learned that sounds terrible i know,  My instructor was my grandfather a great italian singer and he said that once you have mastered your breath and your able to hold it get next to something like the edge of the piano and (with your knees always bent when you sing) pull up on the piano while you are singing your note and you will notice your stomach tighten.  This will enable you to train your muscles to tone for singing out in a louder volume..  This is what I have been told I hope it works for you and I hope your band makes it big.. Good luck.|`|XgVP6bjcaa	u should take singin lessons     good luck on the band

Perhaps they crave attention or have no self-confidence and think by others noticing them, they're "accepted" or "popular:" They need to take a good look at what it did to Anna Nicole Smith.  There's a BIG difference between being recognized for acting immorally or  stupidly and being recognized and accepted for helping others or for one's talent, such as singing or acting.     I think a lot of Reality Shows are an insult to our intelligence, but until the public stops watching such idiotic, trashy shows, they will continue.|`|fcf92f90cb9bace2ce8ea606d576dac3aa	probably someone who needs more attnetion then they can get and needs to find work and money fast so they put themselves out there to try and get fame and work and stuff..|`|DmUdZRL7aa	Sadly, people in this day-in-age feel no responsibility or respect for themselves - or others - and are willing to do whatever stupida** stunt they can pull off to get recognition.

oB7EQvtHaa	Since the latest manga chapter, now that naruto has obtained sage mode, I would probably say him, based on the assumption that when the hero and his rival have experienced the same number of power shifts and power stage increases, as naruto and sasuke have, then it is usually the hero who stands out on top as the strongest.  At the beginning of shipuuden, sasuke was one stage of power above naruto, after having received superior training from Orochimaru than naruto obtained from Jiraiya.  After their initial encounter, naruto gained his fuuton rasengan, which put them at the same stage again.  Then Sasuke defeated Itachi and gain the power of Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu, putting him again at a stage above naruto.  Now that naruto has gained the sage power, he and Sasuke should have assumed the same number of power stage  increases, and because naruto has the advantage of being the hero, when naruto and sasuke eventually fight, naruto will win.|`|AA11149656	Well personally I would have to say that they are at a tie in both Mentally and Physically.    Mentally, if Naruto is really affected then he can actually beat Sasuke mentally.    Physically because he has the power of the Kyubii and friendship or bonds that are true. Rather than Sasuke whom to me at the moment seems more confused about anything else. He's too easily manipulated that it's just ironic.    Overall - I guess..Naruto...|`|REsGUdV7aa	Probably Sasuke since apparently the whole series revolves around him now.|`|aLI7cwMgaa	NARUTO IS GETTING SAGE STRENGTH!!!!|`|Bb0TjFRzaa	sasuke will go blind an naruto has to complete sage mode an he still has to learn his fathers 4th hokage jutsus an techniques sasuke is like max out from his level he won't get any stronger now he's like max so i say sasuke is stronger for now|`|AA12298356	Sasuke right now (but Naruto has potential because of the nine tails)|`|1eR2eEx7aa	A lot of people seem to be asking this question lately.   The real strength between the two is probably too close to measure perfectly. Naruto is always growing, learning new techniques and pursuing his dreams. Sasugay on the other hand [ehem.. i mean Sasuke] was a brilliant fighter since the age of.. nine was it? He trains, and follows up on his techniques.     So to answer your question in total, Naruto and Sasuke are probably the same amount, strength-wise, but they each have different abilities, so it shows differently.     Hope I helped. :)|`|5KmtCYgFaa	i would have to say naruto, no duh.. he's like the main character and the animators make him stronger than naruto.    but if it was in real life sasuke is deff stronger and WAYYY cuter. but i think sasuke's brother is even cuter and stronger.    you may think im a total nerd, but me and my friends watch it for fun, and because sasuke is soo cute!|`|LbOqY5Yfaa	naruto because hes been working to get stronger and saske has the curse and so i don't know who would win if naruto didn't have the nine-tailed fox and saske didn't have the curse inside him in a fair fight but i would say naruto because he never gives up that's my opinion

What we hear as thunder is the lightning breaking the sound barrier and the energy from the lightning being dissipated as sound! The reason you see and hear at different times is because sound travels slower than light. I'd all look up your facts before answering a question!    As for what to do, open your windows and enjoy watching natures fire worls display!|`|KnQN8HvFaa	Open the window and watch.  Love thunder and lightening.

0ee1cc0519d5e8f24a9b842d808c78d7aa	There a couple of people that work on the film's sound that deal with music. imdb.com defines them as such:  Music Editor  A person who, in collaboration with the music supervisor and composer, performs editing on the score, live vocals, songs and source music of a movie.    Music Supervisor  AKA: Musical Director, Musical Direction, Music Director, Music Direction  A person who coordinates the work of the composer, the editor, and sound mixers. Alternately, a person who researches, obtains rights to, and supplies songs for a production.    The job you're talking about sounds like the Music Supervisor. Google this and you should have better luck.

zgT2rB0zaa	From experience I can tell you, the only way you'll win a 'Play Boy's' heart is when they want to change. A play boy is that way 'cause their priority is 'getting some.' They are not looking for a relationship, or looking to find love. They are simply looking for someone to take advantage of and the bragging rights that go along with that. Boy's like that don't think about girls feelings, or maybe they just don't care. I've seen it happen too many times, go for the nice guys. Eventually, when that 'play boy' is older he will probably be looking for someone to settle down with, then his priorities will change. As for right now, stay away from them because trust me, they will only hurt you in the end.|`|524ac46e569c107c3be1dac74e7bae34aa	why would you want to?|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	why would you want to ?   :  )|`|O3ObmJCeaa	forget being good  become a play girl|`|893832c7daec19ecb587baef8e03a807aa	nope... but if my vision is accurate, you can get a pretty good chunk of change for trying!|`|GfnFl8ECaa	no.|`|pN90nXhvaa	i don't really know.

jHZCdFDOaa	im not exactly sure wat bands and stuff but i know that it sits the type of fahsion that is in the show. for example:  punky or modern chic or high fashion they would play like techno stuff    but for like evening wear and gowns and stuff they would probably use music with like a good beat and something that would be smooth and easy to walk to.    hope that helped(im totally fashion and boyfriend crazed so trust me)

o6RVjy4kaa	Cham's sons    Whilst at the edge of nothingness(/emptiness),  (In concert)/(together), scream in the midst  Some swarms of hunchbacks, supposedly.  Let's drink to Moors and recumbant statues.  In the distance, the rattles of the damned persons  Go up(/Drift up) as a funicular.  Old chap, branches(/buds) have faded  Let's drink at chimeras' hop    [Chorus]  Even if rain comes, old chap  Even if hail falls  I bend but never forget myself    At the time when under the bark(/skin)  Strength fail (c-cling baby)  Here it is, there's my opinion  There's my philosophy  At the time when under the bark(/skin)  Strength fail (c-cling baby)    Cham's sons  [Chorus]    The empire, as if it was stunned,  Don't know what to do with so much turmoil.  Act 2 : The era of terror  Or the time of "everyone home"(/"everyone home!")  Opened is the damned person's hop;  Tickets on sale on your landing  "Cham's sons sing poverty  And other edge's tales".    The point isn't, Misters,  To kill or plunder like mad.    To change the world if it can be  To soften it instead of being the dregs of it.  -----  Here it is!  I've put between brackets the translation nearest to the meaning when the first was too... "mirror translation" :-)  Except for "de concert", it also exists in english "in concert" or "in unisson"... But some people don't know that this expression means "together", so, I specified it...    But, for the title, I guess it comes from Cham, the bible's character whose lineage have been cursed by Noe, his own father. But, Cham is the ancestor of the black men, according to the book... So, "damned persons", in fact it's the black people...    Si, ?a intresse les francophones :    Mais, pour le titre, il s'agit  priori de Cham, le personnage biblique dont la descendence fut maudite par No, son propre pre. Or, Cham est l'anctre des hommes noirs selon la bible... Donc "les damns", c'est en fait le peuple noir...|`|5g5WTuSeaa	Il ya plein de traducteur online et aussi essaie sur zouker.com, il ya pas mal de chanson traduit sur ce site.

Its better because it is intelligent, has a plot and the people are in proportion instead of having eyes the size of their face lol  I also think L is amazing lol (i am NOT a fangirl)|`|AeMNMFdiaa	I only seen a little bit of it form the manga when a friend of mine was reading it in economics lat years, I only saw but a few episodes on adult swim but I really like death note, I just wish I could get it on one of my tvs!|`|0LV0jfIDaa	I liked the manga alot, i think they somehow ruined it for me in the movie (anime was okay). I reckon they should find a better looking guy for Light (no offence). But i loved thewhole death note series especially the 3rd movie L changed the world. It wasn't related but it was soooo cool.|`|FOuWkY5Vaa	I love Death Note! I love the manga, I love the anime, I love the characters, I love the concept! It is so original and so good. |`|Yn54ESHpaa	I do, I do! Death Note a superb anime, and manga. The art-work was amazing, the characters all were developed so nicely, and the story was simply the epitome of sheer excellence. Also, building off the characters here, L is by far the quirkiest thing to ever hit Japan, and I loved every minute of his short existence. Luckily, right after his death, we got to meet even more unique characters, such as Mello, and Near. Not to mention the shinigami!     So in short, yes, I love Death Note.|`|w86dRDPGaa	i love death note   Laweit is really cool but i guess Misa-Misa is too, but because Light is the main i guess most would say he is. But Ryuuk is also a main character too  SO ALL IN ALL I LOVE DEATH NOTE|`|4b04c75387288f794c445a45826af7b1aa	I do!!!!

Dejalas asi durante unas 8 horas y repite la operacion unas 3 veces. Esto se hace para que la cuerda memorice la tension y no se rompa al momento de afinarla. Otra cosa, consigue un afinador de esos que te dan silbiditos, o bien afinala con un piano u organo en la escala media, por que si lo haces a escalas mas agudas, por mas que las tenses, siempre se te romperan.|`|jtZmEuYfaa	Cambio montones de cuerdas y es rarisimo que se me rompan, prueba usar una mejor marca, o templarlas ms suavemente.

Bye bye.  Mosquito Fantasma.    Pd: A estas alturas ya deves ser un maestro en cambiar cuerdas, no?  =)|`|sQTiLyDWaa	que raro, todo depende de la marca de cuerdas que uses, trata de afinar hasta donde se escuche bien, al rato se desafinara debido a que la cuerda es nueva tiene que irse estirando, con unas 3 o 4 afinadas quedara perfecta, pero ojo, tienes que ir despacio por que la cuerda es nueva!!

It's a great program and they've come far enough along that you can edit features on them. Also, final cut studio has Motion and a pro sound app. that I really like. Most professional sound editors still use Pro Tools, but the latest edition of Apple's Pro Sound really takes a run at them. For green screen and compositing, I really like Apple's "Shake". It's really sweet! You'd be hard pressed to find anything but a Mac in professional edit suites. And their new quad machine is freakin amazing.|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	I prefer Final Cut Pro, but if you don't have a Mac then Vegas is decent.|`|g2zctmMQaa	apple aplications

AA11004632	Great movie. definetely one of the most moving and amazing movies.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	I saw the movie and did not like it.  It was more of an action film that anything else.

O solo por escuchar mentiras..|`|ab062c338d3833c5fab4421a7adde97eaa	puede ser, hay personas que cuando es infiel una vez y se dan cuenta del error no vuelven a cometerlo, pero luego hay otros que lo hacen una y otra vez.   las personas son distintas de por si y algunos se dan cuenta del error y otros pasan de eso..no se puede englobalizar a las personas, pero lo que est claro, es que esa persona te ha traicionado, te ha echo sentir mal y encima no te quiere de verdad, por que alguien que hace eso...falta a tu respecto, te ha fallado como pareja y ese duele mucho y a veces, por no decir la gran mayora, no se perdona.|`|QoxE7AWtaa	Claro, si es lo mejor que hay.|`|bD5XqMimaa	sinceramente si conozco muchas personas que dicen que no lo vuelven hacer  y siguen enga?ando nunca dejan de hacerlo|`|S4lcAttNaa	NOOOOOOOOOO PARA NADA....

La respuesta, la encontramos en la historia del verbo saber. En latn, el verbo era sapere, con el significado de tener sabor. Tanta importancia daban los antiguos al sentido del gusto,  que pronto lo empezaron a usar en sentido figurado.  Por ejemplo, para decir  huele a chivo, decan hircum sapere, que literalmente significa sabe a chivo. Algo as como ahora usamos el verbo oler, en expresiones como: huele a que pronto comenzar la guerra.  La ms hermosa metfora, naci cuando se habl de saborear las ideas. Entonces, sapere empez a significar tambin tener conocimiento. Despus, nacieron  palabras como sapientia que es sabidura, y sapiens que es sabio. En ambos casos, refirindose a la capacidad de conocer, discernir  y poseer buen juicio. Es decir, realmente lograr  saborear el conocimiento.  Al pasar al castellano, sapere se convirti en saber, y ya lleg a nosotros con su doble significado: tener sabor y tener conocimiento. Siendo el mismo verbo, entonces, su conjugacin debe de ser igual, sin depender del significado a que nos refiramos. De modo que si usted sabe salado, lo correcto es que diga ...yo s a sal.  Un buen chef, busca para sus comensales, platillos que primero se antojen y despus se disfrute al saborearlos. Los que somos educadores y aqu cabemos padres y maestros-, deberamos de tener muy presente la metfora sabor-saber. No es mala idea que, como todo buen chef, nos esmeremos en preparar para nuestros hijos o alumnos, platillos de conocimiento, debidamente aderezados y adornados, para despertar en ellos el antojo de probarlos. As, poco a poco, los jvenes desarrollarn el placer de saborear el conocimiento, placer que debidamente cultivado, algn da podra convertirse en sabidura.

Aun asi me encanta el hombresito gordo, y me fascina su gran sonrisa, creo que eso lo hace muy especial..

It sounds to me that you're on the right track.  The designation "good enough" is something you have to come to terms with on your own.  "Good enough" for what, may I ask?  If you ask "good enough" to become a concert pianist, well, you're not there yet.  That's the thing about piano--- there are a ton of pianists in the world, and you have to be really really really good to make a living as a classical artist (pop and commercial pianists don't have to be that good, but still-- there's tough competition).  But certainly you are "good enough" to do a lot with your piano skills!  Your sightreading ability will definitely come in handy if, say, you have a friend who needs an accompanist or if you want to play and sing some of your favorite songs.  You can make good money playing for Christmas parties and weddings, if you put together the right repertoire.  As far as jazz goes, you might say you're "just OK" but seriously--- you shouldn't put pressure on yourself to be amazing if you've only just joined!!!  If jazz is something you're really interested in, take the time to practice reading the chords, to practice improvising, and to listen to lots of jazz.  Jazz is hard!  (I don't play jazz; I'm a less versatile pianist because of it.  Maybe someday.)  I say, good for you for getting out and trying new things.  You have a nice background in piano; now it's up to you what you want to do with it.|`|LEB1BAIgaa	i'd have to say that you are at an intermediate level but thats just compared to what i play.

ovhLDdHYaa	In the early 1970s, two schools in Alexandria Virginia integrate forming T.C. Williams High School. The Caucasian head coach of the Titans is replaced by an African American coach from North Carolina. Tensions arise when players of different races are forced together on the same football team. Many of these tensions are eased during the two-week training camp in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. When players returned to Alexandria the players found the city in turmoil due to the forced desegregation of the high school. As the season progresses the team's success caused the community to accept the changes. After the Titans' perfect season, the team and the city were closer than ever        Suburban Virginia schools have been segregated for generations, in sight of the Washington Monument over the river in the nation's capital. One Black and one White high school are closed and the students sent to T.C. Williams High School under federal mandate to integrate. The year is seen through the eyes of the football team where the man hired to coach the Black school is made head coach over the highly successful white coach. Based on the actual events of 1971, the team becomes the unifying symbol for the community as the boys and the adults learn to depend on and trust each other        The original script was full of profanity but Disney, in an effort to produce a good family film, asked producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, to remove all extreme profanity from the script.      The real Sheryl Yoast died in 1996.      In real life, Coach Bill Yoast has four daughters, not just Sheryl. Since two daughters were older and one a baby, Sheryl was with her father at most of the games and other events, and the filmmakers thought it would be confusing and distracting to depict the other three. The sisters were fine with it, and enjoyed the movie.      There is one scene in the film where a brick is thrown through Coach Boone's window. In real life it was an old toilet that was thrown, but film makers thought this would add humor to the serious situation.        I hope this helps--I'm sorry if it did not..|`|AA11866403	segregation of sports and how it has change|`|B3tNdXnqaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(myth...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_th...

I suggest that you live him becasue it will bring you trouble in later life.  If he is unsecure now, what do expect when and if you marrie this guy.  He is only going to acuse you of cheating.  Just dump him and get a better person that will respect you and not compare you to other girlfriend.  That not wright if he is already comparing you.  I'm sure there is someone else out there just waiting to meet you.  Good luck on your desitions.|`|ai6sVwnfaa	He is carrying a lot of "baggage" from his past, we all carry a little, but he carries a lot and needs to learn how to leave it at the door as he enters a relationship with you....

I would take his advice and run.|`|BQ7LdPtmaa	tell him that if he can't except that you love him, you'll actually have to "hurt" him. If you love him that much, I don't see why he can't believe it. wait like a couple weeks or so and if he still does that, dump him because you shouldn't have to wait for him to believe his own girlfriend.|`|AA10010475	If he's had many bad relationships and he's only 20, that's what con men call a "tell".  His bad relationships aren't the fault of the other party 100% of the time. I know that Libras want to make things nice, you'll bend over backwards trying to be something you think he needs you to be and it ain't going to last. You'll reach your limit and spring back.     You're not Florence Nightingale nor Sigmund Freud. What he needs is professional help. What you need is a boyfriend who isn't carrying around a bag of grief. Time to have fun in your life, girlfriend.     Get someone who when you tell him you love him he turns around and tells you he loves you right back. Then the both of you go off and have some fun.     This guy you're writing about is not fun.

Now I just don't give a sh*t. The Only way for a guy to get over that, is you have to spend allot of time for him , and make him feel really desired. Guys like that need allot of attention from you, even though they will never tell you. You also have to explain your standards to him. Let him know that you despise cheaters, and he is the one person that you have been looking for all this time. Regaurdles of what you say. It's gonna take him close to 2 years to finaly believe it. Whatever you do, don't cheat on him, or he'll lose his freakin mind and hate your guts till the end of time. lol. true|`|zE6TwSPCaa	ok it is up to your boyfriend to believe you or not. Your doing everything to show him that you belong to him. Maybe hes a littke insecure, or he just have trust issues that he should have got over before he got into another relationship. thats not fair to you. You shoulnt have to suffer because of what other people did to him in the past. Either he can learn to trust you or the relationship is not got to work.you and him will have to go yall seperate ways.........!!!!!!!!|`|h1ED8ZH6aa	give hima  long lecture on why you feel that you're different. If he's convinced he may stop doing that, but if not you may have a really  really jealous guy o your hands. Thats a problem........|`|niuU3Q92aa	wrong timing for both of you|`|brE6tem1aa	i guess u've got to stop complimenting and telling him u care for him...becoz it's pretty obvious that those words have lost their meaning....maybe from past experiences. out of fear that u might dump him like others did; he might dump u before as a precautionary move....seems like he's gotten a relationship phobia....

gmQcQQhQaa	I'm also an Obito supported. The Sharingan in the left eye, the hair style looks just like Obito.    But just because I'm an Obito supporter doesn't mean I don't think of the possibilities that Tobi could indeed be Madara, there isn't really much clear proof other than to ask, "How the hell did Tobi achieve Madara's power?"    That, to me, can only be answered if Tobi was actually Madara himself, unless there is a ninjutsu we don't know of that can help someone obtain someone elses powers.    Don't forget, in the battle between Sasuke and Itachi, Itachi said that Madara is still alive. He never really said who, but closest would be Tobi.    But after all this, I still have my money on Obito, and really hope it is him because I would love to see what happens when Kakashi meets his old friend again.    "Give me back my sharingan, Kakashi!" Says Obito...    "Hell no! Your 'pose to be dead!" Retorts Kakashi...    Heh, I can see it happening. Rofel...|`|AA10622364	Then you'll have to reread it since He said he was Madara in many chapters, Pein says that about him &finally Itachi mentioned him also while he was fighting Sasuke now that is more believable than the Obito theory since that guy was long dead & we saw that.  Now until proved Wrong by Masashi himself Tobi is Madara not the real madara but still he is him|`|QLgElxk8aa	idk|`|PW8LyQEGaa	You make a very good point but check out the cover of chapter 392. It is kinda convincing.|`|xyZCF11vaa	i am not that far in the Manga- but is there no possibilty that they are the same person..?|`|AA10290665	yes, you're right (i just went through goodness knows how many proxys to check the source...)    i guess people say it because, assumingly, he's reffering to himself. also, because itachi and madara killed off the uchiha clan (exept sasuke and each other) together. because they are both in the akatsuki, i'm guessing people assume that tobi and madara are the same. i don't honestly remember if tobi/madara/obito said himself that 'i am uchiha madara' or anything, but yeah.     besides, it's kinda funny to see this guy who was at first, 'trying to become a member' of the akatsuki to 'being (supposedly) the true leader of the akatsuki.     tobi is a good boy!    oh, and people: Zetsu said that. not tobi. tobi doesn't talk in third person. please.|`|oNdKKW6Paa	Yup    Its true we really can't say for sure that Tobi really is Madara,but one of the main supports of this is,him saying that he has his power. Although this doesn't mean entirely that Tobi is in fact Madara.    Yes there are possibilities where Tobi sort of act like,Obito same hair,and the mask that only shows his left eye does help to say that it could very well be Obito. Although for the most part we did se Obito die.    But Itachi had said it himself that Madara is still alive from when they were fighting. Itachi had said that Madara is still alive. Although we really don't know who it could be,but it could mostly likely be Tobi. Not to mention that Madara also had the sharingan,and so does Tobi.     Naruto Rocks!!!!|`|mtwTHweBaa	yes so true!  okay then if you're an obito fan then i am a obito-madara fan!|`|SadhaIO5aa	obito is dead ,tobi is really madara uchiha that's why he's uses a personnality careless ,the opposite like the most are arrogant   to  not being suspected , being madara , he's the true leader of the akatsuki and the creator , he's got sharingan , in chapter 308 , kyuubi talks about him to sasuke , because sasuke has got same sharingan than madara even more great than him ,madra & itachi have destroyed their clan together , it's more logical that would be madara is not obito .

AA11003158	Segn datos obtenidos en la pgina web educahistoria.com, los hechos ocurrieron realmente, en 1756, en la frontera entre Paraguay y Brasil. Junto a las cataratas de Iguaz, los ejrcitos espa?ol y portugus asesinaron indiscriminadamente a 1.400 indgenas.    Una de las razones por las que los conquistadores realizaron estas acciones fue porque al ver que los jesuitas estaban cristianizando a los nativos, y de alguna manera, sacndolos del estado salvaje en que vivan, sintieron amenazado el xito de sus acciones, ya que al estar organizados era ms difcil someterlos.    La confianza que los jesuitas sembraron en los guaranes fue la base para lograr construir las reducciones en Amrica del Sur.  Pero como muchas veces ha sucedido, an en la actualidad, las buenas obras son eliminadas por afectar los intereses de los econmicamente ms desarrollados.    En esta pelcula se muestran claros ejemplos de la libertad que como seres humanos tenemos.  Los nativos no fueron obligados a seguir a los religiosos, fueron ellos por su voluntad y afinidad quienes decidieron contribuir en la construccin de la reduccin de San Carlos, guiados por el Padre Gabriel, quien con su fe logr desde la simpata de los guaranes hasta el arrepentimiento de Mendoza, tratante de esclavos, quien luego de matar en un duelo a su hermano decide seguir a los jesuitas y, despus de pagar por su crimen, unirse a la hermandad.  El arrepentimiento tambin es una forma de demostrar la libertad, pues no podemos sentirnos culpables de algo por lo que no nos creemos responsables.    Tomando en cuenta, que los hechos narrados en esta pelcula estn basados en la realidad, podemos comprobar que realmente para lograr el desarrollo que tenemos, la humanidad ha tenido que pasar por grandes estados de barbarie donde los grandes se aprovechan de los ms peque?os como verdaderos animales, hasta me parece que es la forma civilizada de la cadena alimenticia, pero sta no es para sobrevivir sino nicamente para demostrar superioridad, olvidando que al final todos somos iguales y que todos necesitamos de todos para avanzar.|`|19f441b798977cd792a78ed0975b4d15aa	LA Pelicula entre peliculas...    El que no vio La Mision no vio CINE.    Un film que muestra las aristas dos paises divididos por los intereses de conquista por un lado y el unico objetivo que realmente motivo a los Jesuitas a adentrarse en terrenos tan peligrosos: llevar la palabra de Dios.    Dios por un lado, el egoismo y materialismo humano por otro a su vez  Mendoza el cazador de esclavos para Espa?a (Robert De Niro)  El sacerdote Jesuita "cazador" de almas para Dios.(Jeremy Irons)    Ambos, con sus metodos personales terminan defendiendo la misma causa...    GENIAL, simplemente genial.  Bien escrita, bien montada, bien guionada y muy bien dirigida.    La musica del maestro Ennio Morricone hace el resto.    Este tipo de peliculas no muere nunca, porque son simplemente JOYAS del cine.|`|kB9uYpZeaa	El cine, y la historia han tenido siempre una aceptable relaccion, uno proporciona material y el otro hace caja, aunque sea a coste de ignorar de forma deliberada, cualquier cosa que se acerque a la realidad. Esta pelicula no es ninguna excepcion, pero es sin duda, una de las mas fieles a su relato historico, el delicado tema de los abusos coloniales relizados por los colonizadores espa?oles y portugueses en sudamerica, y la postura de la iglesia ante todo esto.  Gran parte del exito de la pelicula, esta en la eleccion de los actores, Jeremy Irons esta inconmensurable como un jesuita que cree en la fuerza de su fe por encima de todo, y que se mantiene firme en ella, algo reflejado de manera soberbia en las escenas finales. Respecto a De Niro, poco mas se puede decir, ya que vuelve a demostrar lo gran actor que es, consigue reflejar toda la fuerza y el caracter de su personaje, un caracter que parece que vaya menguando conforme avanza el film, pero que solo estaba dormitado, esperando al momento de despertar.  En el aspecto tecnico, la pelicula esta bien rodada, sin grandes alardes, pero reflejando fielmente la dureza que requieren algunas escenas, destaca sobre todo la banda sonora que acompa?a de gran manera toda la pelicula, aunque sin hacerse pesada, y por ultimo, destaco los espectaculares exteriores usados en la pelicula, que parecen sacados de un documental geografico sobre el amazonas. Recomiendo encarecidamente este majestuoso drama historico a todo los fans del buen cine.|`|oVv6hqAQaa	A mi me gust mucho la escenografa, las actuaciones, el sonido , la trama en general, muy bien hecha en todos los aspectos. No me gust el hecho de que es quiz un poco aburrida en algunas escenas y quiz eso le quita dinamismo y hace que el espectador pierda en algn momento el inters y/o el entusiasmo al ver la pelcula.    Una de las mejores de los 80. Gran actuacin de Robert De Niro.    Yo le doy un 8/10|`|7ZmkL8Tpaa	Vemos claramente los intereses de la poca, los portugueses y los espa?oles estn dirimiendo quien tiene el territorio de los guaranes bajo su poder, para ello el Papa enva a uno de los suyos ?un obispo? para decidirlo, pero ya estaba decidido, el Papa no poda ofender a portugueses o espa?oles, significando menos dinero para sus arcas, as es que sacrific a los guaranes.  Se supone incluso que la esclavitud estaba abolida, en cuanto a hacer esclavos a nuevas almas, pero algunos espa?oles seguan capturando escalvos y tb por eso los espa?oles preferan que esas tierras pasaran a manos de los portugueses, pues se vieron con la visita del emisario pontfice y la posibilidad real de ser excomulgados, y si las tierras las tomaban los portugueses, que no seguan al Papa, capturaran a los guaranes y stos acabaran en los mercados y/o fincas espa?olas.  Por otro lado, el emisario pontfice quera que los jesutas abandonaran la misin, significando que de hecho reconocan como no cristianos a los mismos y que no se oponan a las rdenes desde arriba pq negarse y quedarse con los guaranes era oponerse a la corona espa?ola o portuguesa, que enemistara a estos pases con los jesustas siendo expulsados todos de esos pases por los reyes y de otros tb por el Papa, por desobediencia.  Tb vemos como Jeremy Irons tiene un duelo interpretativo con el atribulado Robert de Niro, ya que ste se estaba dejando morir por haber matado a su hermano, Jeremy le conoce con anterioridad y sabe que es tratante de esclavos, le plantea si es capaz de seguir una penitencia y Robert le plantea si es capaz el otro de verle fracasar.  Como penitencia Robert de Niro acompa?a a Jeremy Irons y los dems jesutas a seguir la misin comenzada por el propio Jeremy, llevando una gran tela con sus posesiones (espada, armadura de metal,...), as por toda la selva, incluso por la cascada. Uno de los jesutas, el actor Liam Neeson, le plantea a Jeremy, que es su superior, que le quite la penitencia que ya ha tenido suficiente. Jeremy le devuelve que no est en una democracia, sino en una orden, y que el propio afectado todava no cree que deba quitrsela y por eso continuar con ella. Incluso Liam, le corta la cuerda y Robert va a buscarlo todo de nuevo. Esa carga simboliza una carga mayor que l lleva en su corazn al haber matado a su hermano. Y es cuando llegan al poblado que casi lo matan por la misma, y cuando uno de los ni?os siguiendo rdenes del jefe de la tribu s ela corta, es cuando Robert de N. comienza a llorar. Robert es incluido poco a poco en las actividades del pueblo, incluso lo invitan a una cacera y en ella le invitan a matar a un jabal, rehusando matar. Robert se llega a convertir en jesuta, no por insistencia de nadie, sino por conviccin propia. Al igual que los guaranes, que dejaron que Jeremy se acercara pq utiliz la msica y los iconos de imgenes, sin primero realmente evangelizar con palabras, y viviendo con ellos.  Resulta que esta misin estaba muy lejos, por encima del ro, en comparacin con la otra... Sta. no se qu, que slo tena el inters de la mano de obra para los espa?oles portugueses. Pero Sta.... era una misin prspera, donde los nativos cultivaban, hacan insturmentos musicales y todo. Y el dinero que ganaban se dstribua por igual, haciendo que espa?oles y portugueses, cuyos representantes acompa?aron al enviado papal, los declararan subversivos por no tener como referencia la propiedad privada, lo que significaba un modelo de utilizacin de la tierra y de distribucin de bienes peligroso en su sistema poltico, y que esas tierras fueran una fortuna en s mismas.  Finalmente, Jeremy desobedece la orden del enviado papal de irse del poblado, cuando llegan los invasores est dentro de la Iglesia rezando con algunos nativos. Los otros sacerdotes y otros guaranes toman las armas, includo Robert que la toma de manos del ni?o guaran que le ha buscado su espada en el ro, cuando con anterioridad vemos que haba renegado de matar.  Una de las cosas que se discuten para poder apropiarse de las tierras, es si los guaranes son civilizados y tienen alma. Jeremy les ha ense?ado msica e impresiona al envado papal hacindose acompa?ar por uno de los ni?os que le canta al mismo. Los colonizadores objetan que matan a sus hijos, pero stos dejan a 1 vivo por cada padre y madre, matando a los dems recin nacidos por cuestin de supervivencia, ya que no pueden correr con ms encima para huir de los colonizadores. Imagino que ese dilogo originalmente sera ms largo, pero ilustra que a los colonizadores solo les motivaba sus intereses, y que utilizaban cualquier excusa para acusar de incivilizados a los guaranes.|`|pnvXtCWQaa	Amrica, siglo XVIII. La Misin se encuadra en la jungla tropical que est por encima de las cataratas de Iguaz. All un jesuita, el padre Gabriel -Jeremy Irons-, sigue el camino de un jesuita crucificado, sin ms armas que su fe y una flauta. Al ser aceptado por los indios guaranes, Gabriel crea la misin de San Carlos. A sus seguidores se une Rodrigo Mendoza -Robert De Niro-, extraficante de esclavos, mercenario y asesino, que encuentra su redencin entre sus antiguas vctimas, convirtindose a su vez en jesuita. Despus de a?os de luchar juntos, se ven divididos por posturas opuestas en una dramtica batalla por la independencia de los nativos. Uno confa en el poder de la oracin. El otro cree en la fuerza de la espada.     Fotografa y banda sonora espectaculares; interpretaciones excelentes; dilogos (los justos) sencillos y consistentes. Que no se espanten los ateos si se enteran de que trata sobre las misiones Jesuitas en las selvas sudamericanas: no se exprime el tema de la religiosidad. Aunque s que ensalza la fe. No la fe en seres sobrenaturales, sino la fe en el ser humano... en algunos seres humanos. Reacciones opuestas ante un problema comn: la modestia frente a la soberbia, la obediencia y la desobediencia, esperanzada pasividad y accin desesperada, la integridad vista desde dos prismas distintos... Denuncia la hipocresa y las ansias de poder de la Iglesia y reivindica la nobleza de lo nico valioso que ha dado el cristianismo: la sincera caridad de determinados creyentes.   Los mejores dilogos se atesoran, sin duda, en la parte en que Su prepotente Eminencia habla con los guaranes de la misin de San Carlos, con el Padre Gabriel, como si fueran ni?os de teta, y estos, con sus lcidas inquisiciones, lo dejan a la altura del betn. La escena en la que el arrepentido Rodrigo llega, por fin, a la cima de la catarata es, para m, una de la ms emotivas de la Historia del Cine. Por esto (y por los increbles paisajes) vale la pena aguantar la larga y silenciosa ascensin por la catarata que la precede y que muchos tachan de lenta y aburrida. Es increble cmo, sin palabras, pues tan slo hablan los guaranes en su idioma y sin subttulos, se puede comunicar tanto... Esta es la oportunidad de disfrutar de los mejores instantes que nos ha regalado Robert de Niro en toda su trayectoria.|`|v8QgFZBgaa	Primero. Preguntaste que opinbamos no? tonces pq ponen toda la sinpsis y resumen de la peli????? osciosos...jajjaa      bueno respecto a tu pregunta. Es genal, parami una joya de coleccin de cine.

No too cuz CLAMP has not announced anything..    -Why is Sakura from CCS in Tsubasa OVA 3?!  > beats me >_> in the manga, what guided Sakura-hime home is a silhouette of people/person and we don't know who they are but in the ova it is much clearer. so it's either becuz    i. a fanservice(which i doubt XP cuz this is CLAMP, and Sakura Kinamoto is a powerful figure in CLAMPverse and they wouldn't use her as easy as that)  ii. the Acid Tokyo world is the world of Sakura Kinamoto and she's dead but still powerful to guide Sakura out..(many ppl say this but Sakura Kinamoto actually exist in the timeline of xxxHOLiC and Kobato and Legal Drug so she's not the one dead in Acid Tokyo) so this is untru actually..  iii. the title of the OVA is 'the dream seen by the princess' so CCS Sakura IS the dream seen by the princess which leads to..    SPOILER  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \    Sakura hime finally understands that she is a clone of another sakura in this OVA and that is Sakura Kinamoto. Perhaps CLAMP is telling us this was the time when she realized it..remember the last word she said..  " who was that? was it a dream? or an illusion? Or was it.."--> she realises that THAT Sakura is not a dream, or illusion, but the real Sakura..  Oh, and the dream seen by the princess is also what she has seen after returning from getting the egg and she touches Fay's hand-of what will happen when they go to Infinity.. but nothing indicates that in the episode..hmm..    ^^|`|ospuy80Raa	Are you kidding??    xxxHOLiC&TSUBASA is still on Shonen  Magazine in Japan!    there are 35 vols now    http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/51...     http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/61...

Top level in both talent and skill.    Recovering from the horror of his clan's slaughter, he now fights alone. He rarely lets his feelings show, but there is a white-hot flame burning inside. The blood of the famed Uchiha Clan runs in his veins, giving him the Kekkei Genkai ability -- Sharingan.    Despite his genin rank, Sasuke can use many advanced techniques. After he gains more experience in battle, we expect him to develop even more.  When he was young, he lost his entire family to his brother's hands, but this also made him strong. This is a response to his fears and longing for power, but it feeds him even now.  The famous Uchiha Clan was massacred in a single night...and Sasuke saw it all happen.

aTH0MLCxaa	this question has been asked & answered recently (3 days ago)    Go here for a complete understanding  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    Basically why people like it so much is that each series can take you into their world. Just like a good book or great movie. Each media venue offers something more like captivate the heart, entertain, make you laugh, make you cry, make you cringe in horror, make you think, make you enjoy the artwork and/or music, and mainly make you feel for something. Whatever strikes your fancy.    I forgot to mention why I like anime now. The 1st one I saw was not your normal anime show, known as "Kaleido Star". It was about a young girl who wanted to pursue her big dream and the show evolves around her struggles and triumphant successes. It was beautiful to watch - though at times the artwork lost its quality. But I found myself intrigued with the character's flaws and development. It was not a bloody samarui series or some alternative world which would have made it harder for me to relate with. It was very real and thats what caught my eye. Since then I have been able to expand my view on anime. One thing I don't understand is why these anime studios do not post the 1st 5 eps in the series to get a person hooked so that each person has a good reason to buy them. It seems that they depend more on the fansubs (before dvds are available) to get the word out. Like any new book - usually you can find the 1st 2 chapters free for viewing on the web. This creates interest for the reader to want to buy. This is something I see lacking in anime for North America. They are pretty much spending too much time dealing with bootleggers than anything productive for newbies. At least in the movie industry there is more progress.    [side note: I think what Shay was trying to say is that cartoons are more geared towards children's age group and anime is geared towards all ages. I look at cartoons with a "super hero complex" since many cartoons are created to entertain young people with this superpower (defy gravity) abilities. Just think of all the cartoons you know - Bugs Bunny, Road Runner, TMT(turtles), Mighty Mouse (this shows you I am too old to know the newer ones :), and the list goes on)  hope this helps!|`|IIhiSprlaa	it's japanese animation with a storyline.  basically a cartoon.  i don't understand why people like it so much though. i understand manga.|`|nZzChbAdaa	Anime is pretty much japanese animation. It's really popular and stuff over here in the states because of from many of the great storylines and the animation.     Anime is short for animation and it's pronounced (or at least I pronounce it, there are other ways) ah-nih-may    Anime is about anything you can think of, and it's not just for kids since many people consider it a cartoon. The whole point, I would say, is to entertain and stuff. Plus, it's beautiful in my view!    |`|XwVMbAT4aa	anime is just like any other show, but with animation. There is a lot of anime. here is a site that has a lot of anime.|`|Fh0shlVLaa	Anime is like cartoon. People like it so much because it rules =). It's basically just like real-life drama but with animation.|`|AA11149656	Anime = Japanese Animation  Manga = Japanese Comic    It is those american cartoons but it looks more detailed, and PURTYFUL in my opinion. But alas it's Japanese made. So it's more like "asian"    Try looking it up on wikipedia.org|`|AA12298356	It's kind like Really well made cartoons for teens and adults ^.^  |`|276aabcea487f0d8d91b587b9f1a84d4aa	The point is entertainment, same reason you watch TV or movies.    people like it because they do, people have different interests. I like it because I can watch japanese anime and not stupid crap like desperate wives.  I strive for culture and diversity, I also love art.  Those are my reasons.  |`|qqFvDZSfaa	its Japanese Animation (like a cartoon or something)  well, i like it because its not all aimed at little kids even though its animated. if u think about alot of the other animated shows out there, there mostly aimed at small children. Anime have really good plots too.|`|A9KlJsC3aa	Anime is short for animation and is just like a cartoon except, in my opinion, the graphics are better, the characters are more developed and the plotline has more substance.      Quite a few of the cartoons that are/used to be on cartoonnetwork (like YuYuHakusho, if you're as old as me) are anime and based on manga (japanese comics that you read backwards).    The whole point is that it is just like a television programme, with seasons, episodes and developed characters.  People watch and like them so much for different reasons.     Personally, I watch because I like the plotlines, which are interesting and not normally seen/attempted in television series with real people due to difficulty.  I enjoy the detailed graphics involved and, I like the voice acting (if you watch it with japanese vocals and english subtitles) since I think that the japanese voice actors bring so much to the characters.  But that's just me.  :)    If you are interested, Bleach is a good anime to start with and is about shinigami (death-gods/grim reapers), but it is quite long (going on 180 episodes now) and the plotline is quite in depth.      Spiral is quite short (20 odd episodes) and has a detective theme to it and FullMetal Alchemist is longer (50 ish) and is about, you guessed it, alchemy.    The point is, no-one can make you interested in anime.  If you are, great; if not, that's fine.  It's like a programme on TV.  You may like it for the characters, plot or aesthetics, or you may dislike it for those reasons instead.    Hope this helped.|`|2AoHOZItaa	 Okay MANGA is just the Japanese word for "comics" like we have comic books over here. This also exists in countries like Korea, that's referred to as manhwa, it's all just comics.  Now, to adapt these "comics" into motion, directors usually choose to put it into cartoon (animation) form. This way the story retains it's original "comic" form. The stories can also be made into a live action drama. The content and genres vary. But it's a very popular way to read and write stories generally geared for young adults.|`|7379d2c6bd031d12b039fc049d67309caa	Anime is basically the Japanese version of a cartoon with some differences. There a specific was things are drawn, and other subtle differences.

zMaXDKx8aa	Yeah. I will never tell my mom to cut my hair again! I had long bangs and my aunt told me to cut them or else they won't be considered as bangs. I wanted to go to a pro but my mom said it would just waste money since all i needed was a little trim on my side bangs. So she cut it for me. Then when i looked in the mirror and screamed! I had bangs that were above my eyebrows. I'm Asian and I looked sooo Chinese! Everyone at my school called me China or chinese freak. No one gave me support except my teacher. Everyone laughed at me and so did my friends. I just wanted to die. Let's just say that I won't ever let my mom cut my hair again! Once as my bangs started growing back, I made them short side bangs. Then almost every boy in my class had a crush on me. But then they started rating how I looked like and how much they thought I was hot. Right then, I felt soo weird. Now I know that being pretty isn't all that. Boys will just rate you for your looks. :)      xoxo     ?Ag?l?|`|2DNpd4BLaa	yeaaah   once when i said i wanted my hair cut a few inches off, she cut like half my hair off    i was pissed  D:|`|AA12195571	yes|`|1e6He4D9aa	too many times.|`|VI3pZSKjaa	one word....

v1hCymAEaa	During the first 3 episodes or so I was cheering for him. Then he got all crazy and L came into the picture.    :-P|`|ZIMmGqEAaa	Yeah, I think with certain crimes that the use of someone like Kira is awesome. Nothing small like theft but stuff like rape and murder. I'm sure some people have feelings from both sides which made the show more interesting.|`|tEIGR2vFaa	No way; never supported Kira at any point during the series.|`|IbWmNQFvaa	at first i was rooting for kira, and then L came into the picture and was like the best character ever, then i was pissed at kira for killing L, but i found near to be very annoying and even though i was mad at kira, i thought light's overall character was better|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Here's the odd thing: I was rooting for Kira, but not for Light|`|ybjj5WIhaa	At first I was thinking that what Kira did was right but I changed my mind when I saw what Kira was really all about. I was supporting L and was really mad when Kira plotted his death|`|QSBbXNVIaa	Well I was kind of rooting for Light at first, when he killed people for murder and stuff, but when he went insane and stuff I wasn't rooting for him at all (though I was sad when he died).     But I was cheering for L and Near the whole way through.   I was so sad when L died TT^TT|`|SHKxhxw5aa	I kind of flip-flopped between cheering for Kira and cheering for L. I think I'm even undecided now!     All I know is that when Kira started killing people who didn't deserve to die, (as said above me) I started to lean towards L.     I could see the logic behind both of their sides.     Ah, I love that show! Sad ending though.|`|4b04c75387288f794c445a45826af7b1aa	Yup, all the way through :3 Kira is justice after all, jk!

Then later on he became obsessed with his power and I was kind of sitting there thinking 'FTW?' Then L came along....and I started cheering for dear our raccoon-eyed detictive. I got so sad during the middle of the anime, I didn't want to watch it any more.     0-0 But I had to see what happened to Light.|`|GfYV4g2Caa	yeah.

I was rootin for L!|`|f1dd8c0b746aaddf1d459fa50408506faa	No, i was cheering for l and near, but i like kira's character a bit more|`|h2cPZxmpaa	yeah i was 
AA11525891	The Black Pirate...Douglas Fairbanks. But that was a silent film partially in early technicolor and there was no castle scene in it.    Mythbusters did a show on it also.

VYu4W7k0aa	*clears throat* Edward and Alphonse Elric are two brothers living in the fictional world of Amnestris, a close counterpart to Germany in the 1900s.  Alchemy is the art of transformation of mass, its foremost law being that of 'equivalent exchange'.  Both Elrics are enthusiastic young alchemists, in part due to their father's being an alchemist and having disappeared, breaking her heart.  Upon the sudden death of their mother, the brothers decide to attempt a forbidden human transmutation to bring her back to life.  However, the ritual goes horribly wrong, resulting in the loss of Edward's right arm and Alphonse's entire body.  Desperate, Edward gives up his left leg in order to bind his brother's soul to a suit of armour.      Having had his missing limbs replaced by close friend and automail (prosthetics) technician, Winry Rockbell, Edward sets off to become a State Alchemist (an Alchemist in the employ of the millitary-run government) in order to find the 'Philosopher's Stone', the Holy Grail of Alchemy which should allow the brothers to regain their normal bodies.  However, there is a dark ring of secrets surrounding the Stone, the millitary, and the ethnic massacre of Ishbal several years past...|`|POXOqhOYaa	Hey Kat Atreides. :)    I'm sure you'll enjoy this anime once you get into it, it's very interesting and of course it has it's comical moments where I'll you want to do is laugh forever.     Here's some of the stuff I know about Full Metal Panic.    -Setting:  The series is set in a parallel world, based upon actual world events around the late 20th century to the early 21st century. The story begins in Heisei 10 (1999 AD), where the Cold War has yet to end. China has split into a north and south, with Hong Kong being split much like Berlin. The major differences are:  China has split into the People's Liberation Committee (North China) and the Democratic Chinese Alliance (South China) along the Yangtze River. Kowloon is North Chinese territory, while Hong Kong Island is held by South Chinese forces. Combat in Hong Kong is prohibited by terms of a recent peace treaty.  A nuclear warhead was used in the 1991 Gulf War. This triggered the Fifth Middle East War.  Following the beginning of the fifth Middle East war, the Soviet Union successfully reinvaded Afghanistan (Helmajistan).  Mikhail Gorbachev was assassinated, and the Perestroika was halted.  Significantly different military technology such as Arm Slaves and Black Technology.  Other subtle differences differentiate the fictional world. Common changes are in the Japanese names, as they use homonyms to the names of real life locations. The fictional Jindai () High School is based on the real life Jindai () High School[5] in Chfu, Tokyo. The closest station to the real life Jindai High School is the Senkawa station, changed from  to . The Japanese calendar of Heisei era name is altered from  to . Other geography and names of location in the fictional Tokyo remain identical to reality.  These overt divergences in history form the backdrop of the plot, while the less obvious divergences and cause of these differences form the many intriguing mysteries within the narrative.    -Plot:  Full Metal Panic! is written by Shoji Gatoh and illustrated by Shiki Douji, serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Dragon Magazine since 1998.  The main story develops its characters carefully, and is the shadow or "unusual" events of the protagonist's life. These stories feature the mercenary group Mithril, their mobile base/submarine, called the TDD-1 Tuatha De Danaan, giant humanoid powered suits called Arm Slaves, and the various missions to which Sousuke Sagara is assigned. A highlight of the series is a serious and semi-realistic view of humanoid robotic weapons on the battlefield. The Arm Slave has significant consideration in its portrayal, with explanations given for its power source, operations, maintenance and pilot user interface. The existence of such advanced weaponry and equipment is explained through Black Technology.  The comedic segments are the contrasting "normal life" portrayal of a high school student in Tokyo. These segments are in stark contrast to the more serious main story; explosions are symbolic and humorous, and no death results from these visual gags, while in the main story characters are heavily injured and/or perish when hit by a bullet.  This has led to two discrete series of books within the narrative: the collected short stories, and the full novels. As of April 2007, there have been nine novels and ten short story collections published. There is also a significant number of short stories that have not yet been published in a collection, making the stories difficult to find outside back issues of the magazine. The main storyline is still continuing, with the latest novel, Approaching Nick of Time, released on February 2008. Shoji Gatoh has recently stated in his blog that the next novel will be the "climax" of the series, meaning it could possibly be the final novel of the series. However, there is no specific details, release date or name for the moment. It will probably begin production next year.  The author's handling and balance between the serious character-driven plot of the full plot arcs, contrasted with the caricature portrayal of the same characters in the comedy arcs, is one of the most lauded aspects of the series.    -Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu:  Also known as FMP? Fumoffu, the side-story was broadcast in 2003. It focuses almost entirely on the high school life of Sagara and Chidori, highlighted in the short story collections. The series was a departure from the serious tone set in the first anime adaptation, with its slapstick humor and comedy focus. It's also one of the first Full Metal Panic series to be supervised by animation studio Kyoto Animation.    -Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid:  A third anime series was produced by Kyoto Animation in July 2005. It is the proper sequel to the first adaptation, following the events of the two "Full Metal Panic!

TqBtYudbaa	I agree. You're allowed to be angry when you're upset but you don't have the right to take that anger out on others. It's not their fault you're angry, so you should still treat them with kindness and instead find some other way to let your anger out without hurting others.|`|AA10323577	Cruelty is horrendous revenge and hurts for all eternity|`|ObtHVNsKaa	ive been described as mean and cruel full stop.

(Believe me -- I know a lot of people who actually get pleasure out of being nasty to others -- it is the way they control/manipulate the situation they are in and use people too)|`|a6UuiDMWaa	Not completely, most people want revenge when they are angry. It could have been the person you are angry at was cruel and then you did something cruel back.|`|cE20wh1laa	yeah in a way but sometimes when we are angry we cant help ourselves, we tend to open our mouths without thinking, it takes a big person to apologise when they hurt someone else's feelings or to admit when they are wrong|`|AA12284245	i agree !!|`|fByrTmUKaa	yep, know answer my question  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|nDcbdaMHaa	whole heartedly|`|psmTrwT3aa	i disagree cruelty is a side affect of anger. just like bad medicine anger has uncontrollable side affects.|`|ia0fECB0aa	yes. but when i'm angry it doesn't give others the right to be cruelly jugemental either.|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	I do actually.

fJt5zRTXaa	1)Who do you support more, Kira or L?    >>> I support L. BUT I 100% agree with Kira's teachings, but also at the same time in the end *SPOILER* the Death Note took over Light's mind and turned him into a crazy serial killer. I do think Light had the right idea of creating "a new world with out any criminals that contained people with good hearts" but he went over board when he started killing FBI agents, and if some one new something like Misora Naomi or any one who was trying to stop him. He even said he might have to "kill his little sister" when she got kidnapped. I mean seriously, that's a little over board. I agree with Kira on creating a new world, but killing the innocent is just sickening.     2)If you had the death note, who would you kill?(it doesn't matter if it is in real life or anime) How would you have wanted the person to die?    >>> I think I would probably end up doing the same thing Light Yagami did. But I don't think people like L/Near/Mello exist, their just so darn smart. If they were real, then mysterious homicide cases like "Jack the ripper" and "the zodiac killer" would be solved by now. So I probably wouldn't have any need to kill the innocent since no one could catch me ;)       3)Think of your best friend in real life. If you found out that he/she is Kira, and you are L, would you turn him/her in?    >>> Yes, because don't you remember in one of the episodes when L told Light "I feel you're the only real friend I've ever had" and that same friend was trying to kill him, that's NOT friend ship.    4)If you are Kira, and you had to protect your identity, which involves in killing your own sister. Would you have done it knowing that if you didn't, you might be caught?    >>> I wouldn't kill my own innocent sister, even if I might get caught. She has nothing to do with the "kira case".     5)What would you change about the anime if you could?    >>> I would have *SPOILERR* kept L alive for longer. When he died death note just didn't seem as good any more. I missed they way he sits and his sense of humor ^^. Near and Mello are just 2 people that make 1 L. But I guess in a way he was ment to die so Near could catch Kira.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	1. I support Kira's intentions in the beginning but after he kills the innocent, I support L more. Light became one of the criminals that he was killing and needed to be caught.    2. There are many people I would like to kill but I wouldn't because they haven't actually done anything so horrible to me that they are worth killing.    3. As difficult as it would be, I would. In a way, the best friend would have been betraying me and I would be angry because of that. I would also have to fulfill my duties and do what I think is right.    4. No, I would not. I wouldn't want to live with the endless guilt. I would just turn myself in.    5. I was originally going to say that L should have won over Kira, but I think that it is fine the way it is. If it were any different, I wouldn't like it as much. I guess L had to die...|`|kLyE9QfRaa	I support kira because hes trying to get rid of bad people in the world. If I had a death note I would use it to tell bad people in jail to kill others in the same jail and I would use it to take controll over a famous person and he tell the one I love to go out with me before I die. I would not turn them in because he can just kill me before the cops get to him. Yes I would because my sister stole money and made me and gf break up. I would change the ending to Light defeating near and Light would one day get mugged and Ryuk would kill him there and all the criminals would be eliminated from the world.|`|VYu4W7k0aa	1)Who do you support more, Kira or L?  L by a long shot.  I can't accept the ideal that any person could be 'God' and have the right to kill based on their own judgements.    2)If you had the death note, who would you kill?(it doesn't matter if it is in real life or anime) How would you have wanted the person to die?  I wouldn't... I'm not that vengeful...    3)Think of your best friend in real life. If you found out that he/she is Kira, and you are L, would you turn him/her in?  Oooh, this is a real moral dilemma...  to be honest, I don't know.    4)If you are Kira, and you had to protect your identity, which involves in killing your own sister. Would you have done it knowing that if you didn't, you might be caught?  I wouldn't be Kira if it was in my control... Assuming I was, and that I had a sister, I don't think so.    5)What would you change about the anime if you could?  MOAR MATT, PLZ.  (And he's a redhead, not a puke green head...)|`|ZJrft8a9aa	1) I love both of them but kira because they do deserve to be punished, and I don't think that I should have to suffer because of other people's mistakes    2)If I had a death note I'd kill really REALLY bad people, and Aizen from bleach along with Gin and not toson    3) that's hard... but Iwouldn't because they are my best friend after all, and  REALLY how many friends would L have? but I LOVE L    4) Yes. only because that would befit mygoal, and she may even like it better that way, though if I had to kill my family I would NEVER do that one.    5)I would have change how mellow and Near came in and made them win I would have done    1. made Light win there     or    2. NEVER had L die, and then either way I'd be happy with who wins    thanks I love your quizes and you should make a quiz for bleach^^

I'd even take Katie Perry's cat, Kitty Purry (that's her cats real name), before Lady Gaga.|`|LydL7EN6aa	i think shes pretty... at times... but sometimes its the way they do her hair and make up makes her look weird... i think she is attractive under all the random hair and make up...and clothing... lol!!!...cant stand the straight across bangs either.. looked better with brown hair   http://www.gunpowder-magazine.com/custom...|`|wU0c3i7baa	I think she's pretty in an off-beat, interesting way. Her face doesn't have what we consider ideal proportions or symmetry, but perfection can be boring. Angelina Jolie's lips are big in proportion to her other features, but it makes her stand out. Lady Gaga has a distinctive Italian nose that makes her stand out.     There are bad pictures of her, but everyone has a bad angle. I think she looks really put together and impressive, especially because her makeup and wardrobe are always flawless.    (btw, I'm pretty sure her hair is a wig or at least extensions)|`|VNum3TKyaa	Ya she's pretty she just has unusual hair something more natural would be better..|`|3Z4YFz29aa	she looks like  a transvestite to me|`|AA11878029	nasty|`|7FlqCm4aaa	6/7 points of 10.

Then, I get plenty of rest, lots of water, and catch up on reading, watch some TV, get more sleep, keep the fluids up, and have chicken noodle soup (it really does help) and sprite or 7-up, for one meal (either lunch or dinner, sometimes both, if I'm feeling up to more than one meal, but haven't yet progressed to feeling loads better).  Even if I have to force myself to have one meal.  I eat some dry saltines, just nibble on them when I can stomach them.  Pears are also good on an upset stomach, and when you can keep things down aren't as bad on the return trip. ewwww.  If a headache is also included, I take 2 Advil right away, and then follow up with a third 2-3 hours later.    Anyway, get rest and keep hydrated.

Klw3Ke3Haa	I definitely think they will eventually, just be patient it will be released soon. This is all just a money making business type process. They want merchandising and advertising and popularity/hype to be involved in the meantime for profit purposes. Viz will release it when the time comes because money means everything to them.

NqcnAnC1aa	It's probably the best movie that he's been in.  But I also liked him in P.S. I Love You, and Nim's Island (even though it's a kid's movie).    And yeah, HE IS HOT HOT HOT!!!

fJt5zRTXaa	I can't go ONE day with out anime!   Even when I'm done a anime or manga, I still watch/read it over and over again and never get sick of it. Anime is just different from what I see on western television. Their filled with exitment and the plots are incredible! ? They teach you incredible life lessons and things you probably wouldn't learn every day. But the longest i've gone with out anime/manga is probably 3 days :(. Most depressing days of my life ;) ! ?. ha ha ^^|`|fLrK9s0Laa	3-4 days i think because i lost my internet. :(|`|olLnjC7Gaa	3 weeks, on a vacation with no computers or channels that carries anime.

LOL|`|3N2ElzcQaa	2 weeks|`|SDvs99Ccaa	About a year and a half, because I thought it was childish.But then I read some dragon ball comics, and Naruto comics,and I was hooked on manga.I didn't really get back into anime until I finished dragon ball z, then I watch gt online.I tried an episode of Naruto on hulu.com, and I was hooked ever since.Im also watching bleach,the get backers, and bobobo.|`|FrbHRB5Laa	two weeks that i was at my grans house that had no internet and one tv between 8 people

First anime i ever watched... was Dragon Ball Z, in the Philippines. It was awesome!!! Then... Pokemon, and CardCaptor Sakura. (I didn't even know they were animes. I never even knew animes before.)    When i saw an Amv of CardCaptor Sakura on Youtube... i was like... have i seen this before??? And, i started watching the first ep... and loved it. Thats when i became really addicted to anime.    I also watched Naruto, in Australia (Where i live now) when i was like... 8/9 yrs old???|`|QYki1pyKaa	Dragon Ball  Dragon Ball Z|`|NfRfYewHaa	dragonball then i watched dragonball z!!!!|`|ZDnLfB5daa	Lets see, Naruto, Death Note, Blood Plus, Inuyasha, Bleach, and FullMetal Alchemist (FMA), not only are those some of the first animes i watched they are also some of my favorites.|`|99C4rNpGaa	Sailor Moon, Transformers, Saber Cats,  Ronin Ninjas|`|QzN9K7cnaa	Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Inuyasha.

YJDZwIjKaa	that show sucks.|`|f45b8ff41e1fa90ae65c8a0db95a90d1aa	ben is just so obsessed with amy. he says i love you in every scene he is in. its obvious that amy doesnt love him and that she doesnt want him to have anything to do with the baby. ben is just too clingy and annoying. amy should break up with him already.    adrian doesnt like grace because ricky likes grace and adrian likes ricky. i dont see why everyone loves ricky he is such a heartbreaker|`|K5plVKsPaa	ben is sweet, don't get me wrong. lol but he is just pushy, and well he is frankly very jealous about the whole ricky and amy's baby thing. i guess he wishes that was his baby.     adrian is a very bad word, lol she wants to like do stuff with a lot of guys and it's creepy and weird. i guess adrian has a problem with grace because well adrian and grace are totally complete opposities if you haven't noticed. that's probably why adrian has a problem with her..|`|GIXwJWfvaa	haha okay about adrianne not like grace-- this is  because grace is with ricky now and adrianne is  jealous. though adrianne does say she would rather  cheat with ricky then be cheated on like grace.    and bens problem-- i think hes just being protective..  he may be worried that ricky will move in on him and  amy.. i mean, even if its not bans baby, he IS with  amy.

mj9644G0aa	You are so lucky!!!!!! I love Kings of Leon AND The Killers! I just saw them a few weeks ago and they were awesome! So if you can afford to go to two of them, i'd choose The Killers and Kings of Leon for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|sGBa8Gz3aa	That depends on whether or not you support the death penalty really. I don't so I guess I would rather have the killers live.    Oh, wait the band? And live as in perform live, not the act of living?|`|hvP2fKDmaa	Saw them live about a year after they released their first album. They put on a really good show, the songs sounded amazing and the vocals were on point. I would definitely recommend seeing them live.|`|DXaRyc2Taa	I saw Coldplay last year and they were AMAZING! If you had the chance to see them, you really should. But I've also never see Kings Of Leon or The Killers.|`|0z2cbXRfaa	i've seen the killers twice and coldplay, but i've never seen kings of leon, it is so worth going to see the killers live and coldplay too, there both really amazing live!   you have a hard decision to make there lol|`|EpOU7vGYaa	i LOVE THEM ALL!!!   but in my personal opinion, i would choose between kings of leon.  if i were you, id go with the kilers   i wish i was in new zealand :'(|`|s90jW3rwaa	Oooh, tricky tricky tricky! No seriously, I would love to go to all of these acts as well but I love KOL the most so I'm seeing them yaaaaaaay. KOL have actually been to New Zealand quite a few times, so maybe they will come some time soonish again?  Are you sure you love all of them to like the same amount? I've heard Kings of Leon are really good in concert, so maybe them?   Try to make a decision soon though, KOL tickets are apparentely almost sold out and I'm sure the killers are selling fast    Good luck!!!|`|y9I7D3J5aa	If you love the Killers, see them. I've seen them live 4 or 5 times, and would go monthly if I could :-)  You could always check youtube for live performances from all and see which you fancy most.|`|A5nYGJVNaa	i love the killers and coldplay but if i had a chocie it would definately be coldplay. i think coldplay is just on a much higher level then both kings of leon and the killers.|`|vdMkqfufaa	Coldplay is more talented, but The Killers would probably be more fun. Coldplay is not quite as upbeat. I like both of them though.

ZzqWzFNiaa	Magnolia. He will never be as good in any movie as he was in Magnolia. It was a fact that kind of made me feel bad for him watching it, kind of like watching Paul Rudd in Wet Hot American Summer, knowing that the performance in that movie was so perfect that no matter how good he was in another movie he just could not be that good again (though I'll admit that his role in Tropic Thunder did make me think about it. The performance (or more so the character for him to play) still wasn't nearly as good). That Magnolia character/performance just had everything in it and he nailed it. A great, multi dimensional (and pretty deeply so) character. He was just so good in that movie. Actually, that movie in general is pretty unappreciated.|`|8uePKbebaa	Born on the fourth of July    He had to play a soldier on wheelchair and the movie captured the essence of what soldiers went through when they came home like PTSD and adjusting to social life|`|3mJiPveSaa	I think he peaked as a serious actor at Minority Report. I think that one challenged him physically and as an actor more than his other roles. He doesn't seem to have the same level of commitment or seriousness since. Jerry Maguire and A Few Good Men were also excellent Cruise films - full of his patented energy and intensity.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	i agree with prof about magnolia, great movie, tom's best work.|`|ieiseiv4aa	Jerry Maguire - best acting job      Honorable mention goes to Taps|`|aajzynKsaa	That's sort of like asking me -  "What's your favorite infectious disease?"    I'll say Born on the Fourth of July.    My cousin was in it.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	I can't believe that nobody has said "Collateral."      That was, by far, his best, though I also liked him (rubber nose and goofy teeth and all) in "The Outsiders."  He was also good in "All the Right Moves."  He showed some promise in that early role.|`|VPBkqdxcaa	well i think Mission Imposible 1 it was good and original and that song mostly everybody knows|`|F2ugW4cRaa	Top Gun, he was a fresh young star, and it was a great movie. IMO|`|tLI94qWNaa	I think his best film would have to have been Interview with a vampire, he was so dark and wicked in that movie and played the part so flawlessly.  No one could have done a better acting job then him.|`|bNRUjnGZaa	I like Top Gun but the Jerry McGuire or the Rain Man were probably  his best acting job.|`|f8d37f51816f93a01c3756a4f407dca2aa	Tropic Thunder.  Partially because it was so recent, but primarily because it was so not anything like him.  His prosthetics and his demeanor were brilliant in that very funny movie.|`|PpWosZsIaa	Rain Man, as he bonds with his disabled brother. Both Tom and Dustin were outstanding in Rain Man|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	tom cruise is not my favorite actor|`|6HXUbN5zaa	i would say rain man but i also liked a few good men and top gun.

BINKHZKtaa	I know this won't be a popular answer but I think Brittany Snow is absolutely goregous.  She seems to have a great down to earth personality too, which makes her even hotter.  She is the exact defination of my "Type."  Cute, bubbly, sweet, amazing eyes, great body, flirty, talented, etc.  I hate the idea of celebrity crushes, but I love that girl.

wU0c3i7baa	I'm 20, but I'll answer anyway. I was raised by older than average parents and grew up with older than average siblings, so I always listened to oldies. The radio stations in NY suck, so I usually opted for the oldies stations.     I like modern stuff too (more indie than Britney though) but I love lots of things from Fred Astaire in the 1930's to Frank Sinatra in the 40's, Buddy Holly in the 1950's, TONS of stuff in the 1960's, David Bowie and CBGB stuff in the 1970's, to New Wave and Post-Punk in the 1980's.     You can't like bands like the Strokes, Arctic Monkeys, Bloc Party, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and MGMT without looking backward.|`|KdCzS5Q4aa	I'm 17 and The Beatles are one of my favourite bands!  But I agree that most teens tend to listen to the charts.  I love the chart music as well but I dislike anyone that is really overplayed like Rihanna.  I love Michael Jackson too!|`|hCI6HFEnaa	I'm in that age group and I really like like listening to Bob Marley.  It's not unusual or different.|`|9ClKv4Pzaa	im 16 and i listen to older songs like by whitney housten (before she turned to drugs, she used to be one of my fave's!), and to other stuff my parents like to listen to.  i like all kinds of music actually.  not too much on rap though.|`|PhTKb3JUaa	I'm actually 23 now, but I've always listened to 60s music.  I have sirius radio now and the 60s on 6 station is my favorite.|`|AZPxEhL3aa	I am between those ages and I know plenty of oldies songs.  In fact, I prefer oldies to the newer stuff.

I mean, i may not have very man friends, but i find it waaaay easier to be mean than to be nice.|`|zeCZiR6Taa	too mean would have no friends cause they'd all hate you    too nice would have no real friends cause they'd all use you.     hmmm.....at least with mean, you'd have respect. |`|crjnnRoHaa	I'm a bit confused.  Do you mean would YOU rather be too nice or too mean or have SOMEONE ELSE be too nice or too mean?  I think I'd choose to be too mean because I like to be a *****, lol!  However, I'd rather have others be too nice to me!|`|AC71mylDaa	i was to nice, but i learned how to play that game. so now id say to mean, because i wouldnt want to be a pushover.|`|557d27aa4483b67485eca578e6f5730eaa	well i would probably choose too nice becuase thats what i classify myslef as right now although i wouldnt want to be used |`|NFZjJMDOaa	That is the question? mean ill give you calcium buildup and make you rot inside.

Hubby doesnt like to get screamed at and it would make my kids cry.|`|qDKVVFY4aa	I been too nicely in my entire life and some people take it for advantage. I still pick too nice but to be mean to those people who treat me mean. |`|LwS75xPPaa	I think I'd choose to be too mean.  All my life, I've been the former and have been walked over and shoved to the side time and again.  Before I went into business for myself I was always underpaid and overworked, people showed a total disregard for my feelings no matter where we were, and often when I put another person first (stranger or friend), I got penalized.  (When trying to deliver some money to a friend who needed a loan, I drove through a puddle that totaled my car that was only 7 months old.  Do NOT buy a Chevy!)  No good deed goes unpunished indeed!  Throughout my life, I've come across a wide variety of people and it seems that at least 65% of the mean people I meet are very successful financially.  Why?  Because they don't mince words, don't care if you like them, and if you try to lead them, they'll force you out of the way.|`|nn6ClVBGaa	I choose the former.|`|qnysoSXVaa	too nice i dont like hurting ppl mentally|`|qWMaMPFVaa	I'd be too mean too.

Very few adults add the 1/2 bit.|`|AA10633259	Only kids under 14 say that |`|W8Ket9DKaa	No only little kids say that. Or when you are dancing with a guy and realize you are younger than him.|`|BGXpvnuEaa	yea i would say kids under 14 because they are trying to seem older than they actually are. some may not do that. i remember when i was 5 i used to do that

Yellow sunset slowly dipping down in the rear view  Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you  I could have done that a whole lot more  If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish  Thought about her more, thought about me less  Joked and maked her laugh, held her when she cried  A little more that.. maybe I...    Wouldn't be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway  Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be  Going any place she might go beating on the dash  Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face  If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...  She wouldn't be gone.. she wouldn't be gone..  [ Find more Lyrics at www.mp3lyrics.org/IxiU ]    She warned me it was coming said if I didn't change She was leaving  I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out,  God, I believe her now  Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend  If they've seen her, they ain't sayin, they ain't sayin...  Now, Im cursing like a fool, praying it ain't too late  All I wanna do is fix my mistakes.    Find her beg her for one more try, until then damn it I"ll..  Be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway  Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be  Going any place she might go beating on the dash  Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face  If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...  She wouldn't be gone..    I wouldn't be beating on the dash  Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face  If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...

Christina's voice is more powerful and amazing (God definately blessed that woman with some pipes..though she doesn't always use them for good...). Hmm..    Christina's music is more...varied. Britney's is funner to dance to. They're both pop singers so you can't say that they are too different. They don't always write their own songs. I don't know if they play instruments. Brit is known for lip syncing every once in a while. Christina just started doing that..at least once. Hmm...such a hard thing.      But. Hmm..as far as your question is. I hate Womanizer.

Trascorrono gli ultimi giorni sempre insieme e arriva il giorno della partenza...Nana e Yano fanno una promessa:di rivedersi un anno dopo senza che nesuno dei due si innamori di qualcun altro....la serie finisce qui,ma il manga continua....

Z8PAY0sBaa	Ciao!! Fai bene,  un anime/manga stupendo!    1) Anime e Manga sono molto simili, seguono sempre la stessa storia, magari l'anime  un p allungato, ma niente di ch. I film invece non centrano niente con la trama.    2) Il nome di L si trova in un film, mi pare "L: Change the World". Scrive sul Death Note il suo nome vero, e in pi  uscita col volume 13 appena uscito in Italia la Death Note Special Card con il suo vero nome, puoi trovare il video del nome facilmente su youtube:    http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=WjuUXJhjAg...    S, il film  esatto.    3) No,  morta e stecchita. Basta, fine della discussione.    4) Qua:http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=hcvIxTVafk...    Mi dispiace, ma sub-eng!    Hanno deciso cos, non si sa, forse il gesto di Light non era poi tanto bello...anzi non lo era proprio!    NON MOLLARE! Ti consiglio di tenere duro, non so se l'hai gi finito! Comunque  bellissimo, uno dei migliori. Ciao, Notte!|`|igOSFaTBaa	1) anime, manga e film sono diversi?? In cosa si differenziano?  Manga e anime sono sulla stessa linea, anche se ovviamente, come succede un po' x tutti gli altri anime, la versione animata  pi particolareggiata. Hanno fatto 3 film di death note che non ho ancora visto, ma so che sono delle storie a s.    2) in che episodio si scopre il nome di L?  Non si scopre. Si scopre quello di Near per all'ultima puntata. Purtroppo l'unico a sapere il nome di L  lo shinigami Rem. Neanche Light e la polizia lo vengono mai a sapere. Se leggi il manga invece dovresti trovarlo al volume 13    3) La fidanzata del poliziotto dell'FBI ucciso da Light che fine fa?? Non la si vede pi...  Si suicida. Si capisce chiaramente dalla scena in cui c' lei che si allontana da Light e si avvia verso un luogo dove si vede la corda con la quale s'impiccher.    4) Perch hanno tagliato la scena del funerale di L?? dove posso trovarla??   Che io sappia non esiste proprio questa scena. L viene sepolto in gran segreto ma non si sa dove.    Ti capisco, anche a me Death note ha preso tantissimo e anche io ho passato 5 giorni a guardare tutti i 37 episodi. Troppo bello. Dopo il numero 25 x qualche giorno nn l'ho + guardato. Non potevo immaginarmi una storia senza il mio personaggio preferito, sigh. Poi dopo, nonostante nn mi piacesse n Near n Mello, ho continuato a guardarlo e a pensare a quanto fosse superiore a tutti quanti il mio bellissimo e bravissimo L:-(|`|38tdLcP2aa	allora il film  nn l'ho vist ma ho visto i pezzetti e sembra bello   poi il manga  strabello   l'anime  il + bello in assoluto   allora l'episodio ke si scopre il nome di L   quando muore x mano di Rem   la fidanzata del polizziotto siccome sa molte cose va a dirlo alla polizia dove incontra light e vanno in giro a parlare ma alla fine riesce a dargli il vero nome e light la uccide   e la scena del funerale di L nn s dove sia e neank s se esiste|`|b4mwjZsIaa	1)anime e manga hanno grosso modo la stessa storia!ma esistono tre film di Death note e nessuno centra niente coll'amine/manga e sono:  Death note  Death note: the last name  L Change the world      2)nell' anime non si scopre mai, l'atrice lo rivela solo nel tredicesimo volume del manga intitolato "How to Read" in cui si trova una storia breve in cui un ragazzino usa un death note e uccide i suoi compagni di classe. pentito chiede a Ryuk una soluzione e lui gli da una death eraser: una gomma che riporta in vita chi  stato ucciso col death note!  in realt miente a che fare con la serie!  cmq riporta anke i veri nomi di L Near e Mello!  non te li dico perk forse vuoi scoprirli in altro modo!  nella versione italiana hanno inseito una scheda di identit di L col vero nome!!      3) la ragazza del poliziotto non si vede ma si presuppone che si suicider come aveva descritto Light!    4)non so se c' una scena del funerale, io pure ho visto DN in Jap sottotitolato e non mi ricordo sta scena!controller e ti dir eventulamente!        pensa che io ho passato un weekend intero solo a vedere death note! non ce la facevo ad allontanarmi!

AA11225694	Miracle  This movie reminds me of the movie Hoosier, but instead it is about hockey not basketball. I love the methods and ideas this coach uses to break down his team, and how he was able to build them back up into an Olympic Gold Team for the USA. This coach stuck with his beliefs even when know else believed in him, but in the end everyone loved him. The idea he would do what he thought, maybe even KNEW was the right thing to do, and continue to do it, Political correctness be damned...|`|yLm5xEWMaa	like an old Rogersby painting; it is best to be a little derivative.

I use the examples of business magazines because you mention the cost side of the debate.    To be frank I think you are unlikely to get more coverage than a letter.

Children perceive things differently and you have no idea how it might affect him/her in the long run. Ask your local video store for a more appropriate movie that might be a little scary, but not so much that he/she has nightmares for days to come. Children are impressionable and movies can effect them years down the road when for an adult it would be over as soon as the credits rolled. |`|Wnd8LRovaa	Well it depends how mature the 10-year-old is. Also, it depends who is asking, i'm assuming you are the parent. Is he familiar with jason and freddy?    The movie has nudity, and I think violence. I don't think it is that scary, it was pretty neat how two villains fight each other. But is the child the type to have nightmares? Or does he like a good scare?    If you've answered yes to these questions, then go for it, if you are unsure then I advise you watch it to see what the child would see or chose another movie|`|qiPWnKpRaa	uhhh....... are you crazy of course it's not|`|FWjjkzIBaa	Yes.

Your child may be angry you say no... but ... as they saying goes, it's only because you love them.    There's other "scary movies" that are more appropriate.  Ask the clerk at the movie rental place for a suggestion & be sure to mention its for a 10 year old.|`|LAPWaCPcaa	maybe if its on tv but its pretty violent.|`|TJ7IIlKvaa	no definately not. it shows a naked girl in it. the violence is really good for a scary movie but the girl is not good for a ten year old|`|aQKYVZj6aa	Ya if he's mature enough. It's up to you. But I don't think it's a good idea because of all the blood,violence and bad language.|`|dYmMPFVCaa	According to IMDB, No.    If you want quite a scary movie that you think may be appropriate for a 10 year old, try "Shawn Of The Dead".  It's funny and slightly scary, but there are a few adult jokes and violence. Nothing that today's kids can't handle.|`|rS4XBIj1aa	yeah i saw dat when i was 6 nd i just kept coverin my eyes nd missed it all but den after dat i wasnt scared 4 sum reason nd i watched it gawd dat movie is hillarious nd dat nerdy guys kinda hot im not even guna lie|`|jid5DmCjaa	No!!!!!!!|`|qf8R6PKGaa	It will scare the daylights out of him.

Like in poker you would pretend you have no good cards and end up having really good cards... yeah i'm not sure if it means something else in the song though...|`|bWNyWXrSaa	No, it's just a straight face.

IXZW0etoaa	verdaderamente yo jamas he sido infiel, ni por la mente me pasa, pero yo creo que quien es infiel, jamas se arrepiente, ni siquiera se siente mal por haberlo hecho, mas bien lo tiene en mente como quien gana un trofeo en una competencia|`|2Ivtvytiaa	Bueno, hay que ver por que motivo haces esta pregunta.  Si alguien con quien estabas te fue infiel y esta arrepentido, exprime la situacion y saca lo bueno.  Es decir, date cuenta de que de no haber sido por ese error no se hubiese dado cuenta de lo mucho que te quiere.  Y probablemente aprenda la leccion y no lo vuelva a hacer.    Por otro lado, depende de la persona, hay gente que reacciona como peque?os animalitos que aunque cometan un error, vuelven a hacer lo mismo.    Personalmente.  Yo trato de vivir el momento, y nunca eh sido tan idiota como para serle infiel a mi novia (o a mis ex's) con alguien que ellas conozcan.  Y jamas eh tenido alguna amante de planta, siempre han sido cosas de una noche y ya.  Y si en dado caso me llegaran a atrapar, pues simplemente dejaria que ella tomara la decision de seguir con migo o de dejarme, pues bien conciente estaba, de que tenia novia, a la hora de meterme con alguien mas.    Suerte.|`|3aBfB2Okaa	haaaaaaaayy  que pedradon me das brother  pero te dire  alguna vez si era un infiel descarado  con una con otra y la otra  pero llego una chava  y me domino  con decirte que jamas volvi  la cara para ver un trasero de otra mujer  (claro en su presencia no pero ps es imposible no ver un buen trasero)  pero  q creess???  la hija de .......  me enga?o  y pos  me regrese a lo que era  un wiloooooooooo sin piedad  jajaja    (asi, no me arrepiento)  |`|1iruEK7caa	En una etapa de mi vida no me importaba la fidelidad, pero  cuando se alcanza la madurez y tuve  una vida matrimonial, comiense a reflexionar y me arrepent por todas las infidelidad cometidas y he luchado mucho por no ser infiel, aunque a veces me han dicho que soy un tonto, que desperdicio las oportunidades. Pero no importa, quiero serle fiel a mi esposa por el resto de mi vida. En la amistad trato en lo que mas puedo a ser fiel a mis amigos y amigas.|`|W9ZkQjIHaa	soy mujer, pero dejame decirte que ellos siempre se arrepienten, pero SIEMPRE lo vuelven a hacer jaja!....|`|acFWPE2Daa	no creo que uno se arrepienta de las cosas porque ya estamos muy grandesitos y sabemos muy bien lo que hacemos. Adems creo que esas son pruebas para consolidar ms la relacin, cuando uno est con alguien que no es su pareja se da cuenta de que en verdad la ama y est con la otra solo por sexo.
n1z3eUvZaa	Yeah you're just adjusting to the reduced sugar. It will be worth it in the end though.|`|qADndZJKaa	Probably... make sure you're drinking something to replace the soda though, or you'll be tired from dehydration too.|`|pxTvnAtJaa	Quit soda? Why don't you try and quit cigarettes after smoking for 10 years like me. Quityerbitchin.|`|LOVcIn3Faa	Maybe try to get off pop a little slower. Like if you drank three cans a day then bring it down to two the first week. Then drink two cans the next week. I have a friend who starts shaking when he doesn't get all of his pop. He tried to quit cold and it was really hard. Good luck if you can totally quit cold that is awesome.|`|79yjBOmbaa	Try drinking natural unsweetened fruit juice, it has enough natural sugars.

EcsXPxDpaa	If you listen to anything while thinking of Edward & Bella, I find you will be able to relate them to it.    Honestly, no matter what I'm listening to, if I'm going through a Twilight phase...it'll make perfect sense to me! :P    I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but try that!

fd4d1cab288a24bfdab8fbc929a2ffb4aa	I think you have a lot to work with. You are on the right track. My advice would be to get with a vocal coach and work on finding your range (although the range in your video wasn't too bad) and expanding it. Also work on your pitch a little. But the way you project is good. But a vocal coach could even help you learn how to breathe correctly when you sing. That will help your singing tremendously.     (I know all this because I once had problems getting volume when I sing. I also had pitch problems worse than you. Then I took lessons, and that made all the difference in the world. And it all depends on how far you want to go with developing your singing voice.)    I am just giving some friendly advice. I wasn't trying to put down what talent you do have. I was just trying to give you some specifics on what to work on. I hope you don't take offense at anything I have said, because you do have talent.    Hope this helps.|`|DCwKJUvHaa	WOW. Your great, you are 100 times better then most of the people who come on here asking if they can sing. I really liked that. You have a unique voice and that style of singing is very marketable atm. You need lessons and a bit of touching up, but you might make it one day. |`|DuQJ1Zataa	verry good  i give it a 8.5 outta 10  just need to hold ur breath on some parts   overall veryy amazing voice (:

x6QPIbFSaa	Honeslty, it'll be extremely hard.  Consider all the other aritsts that are trying and competing for record labels attention.  If you think you have the skills and raw talent, then you shouldn't give up because maybe you could get signed or noticed.   The chances are just one in a million but you could be that one.  |`|fd4d1cab288a24bfdab8fbc929a2ffb4aa	If you really are that good, then it is possible. For instance, I think Lee Ann Rhimes was 14 when she started (Again, I THINK). It may not happen overnight. Some people might say you need to get a little older, but don't give up. Even if you only sing locally, keep doing it if singing is truly what you love to do. |`|l4gpm238aa	i played gigs at 14... if you're any good people will take you seriously... just don't get your hopes up.... being rock stars isn't really realistic... local gigs maybe|`|fxsJjn6jaa	Yes. When it comes to business, everyone will take you seriously.  But you have to try to be serious. Trust me I know, I'm on Broadway and i'm 12.
pIflxsCsaa	Well, I started to sing the first time I watched American Idol and I never stopped. I literally sing 4 hours a day. If you want to become better, look on youtube and the internet for tips and "voice lessons" and the main thing you have to do is PRACTICE! If there is a song you really want to learn how to sing, but can't...don't give up! Break it down. Do a verse at a time until you have to whole thing. You can also make an arrangement of the song and eliminate the hard parts you're having trouble with. |`|fd4d1cab288a24bfdab8fbc929a2ffb4aa	My voice is not the greatest either. I got started singing in church because people prodded me to do so. My problem was confidence, and not knowing how to project. Then I took lessons. At the end of about ten weeks, we had a recital. After my solo, I went back to my seat where my parents were both grinning from ear to ear. I then knew it was mission accomplished. Of course, I am not done learning all I need to know, but knowing how to breathe right and therefore project, was a good start for me. If you are having problems with confidence, I would definitely recommend voice lessons. As one of the other answerers suggested, sing fun, upbeat songs that you can really get into. And to start out, don't worry about what others think or say (except your voice teacher-listen to what they say.)|`|SbrjQaYdaa	What I used to do was, just sing in a my room with a guitar and just have fun...It probably sounded awful, but you get over all the nerves and stop caring about what you sound like...that's the easiest way to get rid of playing in front of people...another way is to learn your favorite song on piano or guitar...and play it in front of friends or a brother/sister/parents, people who could care less what you sound like...start small and comfortably and then you can move onward!|`|Hg9xeaImaa	Well, I got started in my church...and I took lessons for a very long time... I don't suppose that helps though! :)    Do you have a particular artist you like singing along with?  If so, BLAST their music as loud as you can (without offending your parents/roommates) and sing along.  You'll feel more comfortable if your mind is distracted by the other singer.    Sing fun songs, like Disney songs and Weird Al songs, that aren't serious but will help you feel comfortable singing.    After a while, you will stop caring what people think about it, and you won't worry so much!  :)    Good luck!

I wish they would have put in the line "...bring on the shackles" though.|`|Ggv3evcqaa	i don't care what anyone else thinks, i think the actors and actresses in it were all PERFECT for each part. |`|1YmnVk8Oaa	That's crazy that you waited 5 hours in line! My boyfriend and I got there an hour early and there wasn't a line at all, and we don't live in a small town or anything(Austin, Tx). Anyway, I was really worried because I loved the books so much and I knew that the movie could either be really good or really bad. In the end I was happy with it. I think it could have been better, as some of the parts were pretty cheesy - like the first time he smelled Bella in biology, the way he looked sucking the venom out of her arm, and that sillyness about climbing up the trees and referring to her as a spider monkey. The movie looked like it had a really low budget, but other than that I think they did a really good job with it. I was unsure of the casting before I saw it, but now I think that they did a perfect job with all of the characters, especially the Cullen family and Charlie. I heard that the characters had signed a contract to do 3 of the movies, and that the 2nd movie is already being planned and could be out by December 09!!

Md47g4tWaa	i think you should write a fan mail or try going to his website...maybe you can find ways to communicate with rob there...?|`|7WybdnLjaa	Miley, I do not want to hurt your feelings but think about what you are asking. I assume you do not know Robert Pattinson....or you would have a way of getting his number. Do you, if you could get his number here, think that it is okay to call him? Don't you think it may be overwhelming and unhealthy for him to constantly be available for every person who wants to talk to him? Not only would it be unhealthy for the person receiving the phone call, but for you (or anyone in the same situation), making the call. I bet that you really don't want to be one of "those" out of control fans and you just haven't thought it through.  I think one of the other responders was right on with "contacting" him via fan mail to the appropriate place. I do believe there are websites (a ton I'm sure) that have an address to write to. That would be a great and healthy way to express whatever it is you want to express.

46360995da1d782eeb1a640227e2fed4aa	Defining Arabic music is a matter of debate that I really feel unqualified to deal with.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_Musi...    If you define the Arabic scale as C Db E F G Ab Bb C,    http://harp-l.org/mailman/htdig/harp-l/2...    Then what you do is purchase two Hohner Country Tuned Special 20 harmonicas.  If you want to play the above scale in the key of C, purchase a B and a C.  Take the bottom plate off the B and put it into the C harmonica.      http://coast2coastmusic.com/cgi-bin/cart...    The Special 20 is a pretty good just intonation sound, and Arabic music lends itself to this approach.  The note layout will also give you a great middle eastern sound if you want to play western music to an Arabic beat.    www.harptabs.com    A more expensive approach would be to stick with a chromatic harmonica which will allow you to play other scales that fit your perception of Arabic music.  I dont recommend this approach.   Chromatic harmonicas are very difficult to play and are flat out not very good harmonicas.  [Dont everyone jump on me at once here.  I have a right to my opinions.]      If you are really interested in playing chromatically, stacking two diatonic harmonicas one step apart, like a B and C, would be just as good or better than purchasing a chromatic harmonica.  You can play one stacked on top of the other and use a 12 tone chromatic scale.  Simple enough, just put the two harmonicas you purchased back together and stack them one on top of the other.  This would take considerable skill, so it wouldnt be as fun as the one harmonica I am suggesting you construct from two Country Tuned harmonicas.    If you are serious about playing all possible Arabic scales you are going to spend some serious money on customized instruments and only play one diatonic [seven note] scale at one time.  We are talking twenty four notes of which you play only seven at one time in Arabic music.  I counsel against this!    If you want to pay for a customized harmonica:    http://www.seydel1847.de/epages/Seydel.s...    http://www.patmissin.com/    http://elkriverharmonicas.com/    If you really dont know what you are looking for, Pat Missin is rather well educated about alternate tunings and can school you along as to what you should be playing.  As for myself, I think Ive given you a good tip.    Then again, you can just purchase what is called a harmonic minor tuned harmonica which has the scale of C D Eb F G Ab B C.  This will give you a middle eastern sound, but will not sound nearly as good as what you are looking for!    http://coast2coastmusic.com/cgi-bin/cart...    http://coast2coastmusic.com/cgi-bin/cart...|`|TTJIXXp7aa	..|`|DQkDQraOaa	Any, as long as the person playing it knows how.|`|HBUO10i7aa	THE ARABIC KIND, DUH!

If you mean the one that you saw by going to the movies, United 93 is it.  If you mean one that you saw on TV, it's one of the other two.

ACiTb0c0aa	I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen's books, Pride & Prejudice is my favorite. I prefer the 1995 version, because it's more detailed and complete. I love Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and he also has a good chemistry with Jennifer Ehle. The 2005 version is also really good, I think Keira and Matthew make a great pair, but the 95 version is more faithful to the book.|`|0HO8sTGeaa	1995 .....the original version of course.=8~o|`|AwBVoWOaaa	I think Keira was a better Lizzie. I loved both Darcys. I think both Matthew McFaydden and Colin Firth were perfect, although Matthew is more handsome. I guess it's all a matter of what your taste is.    And Donald Sutherland was just wonderful in the 2005 version.  We all know films tend to cut a lot of things, but I still choose the 2005 version just because of Keira.     I don't even like her that much but she was simply brilliant and I don't like Jennifer Ehle's performance. She was kind of dull in my opinion.|`|5dc9b89c7481af2876ee4c8e5a69fe13aa	I have more Austen's feelings  in 1995 version.|`|hGY08GjRaa	the 1995 movie is done much better.. the only thing better about the 2005 one is that the cast is more attractive. And it's good if you want to watch that story, but don't have 5 hours, only 2.
SkRJNhuCaa	Don't buy a guitar based on pictures and words on a website.   Play it based on how it plays, how it sounds, how it feels in your hands.  But yes, as other said Fenders are pretty nice.|`|LBvWR0YZaa	It all depends. If the back is a 2 or 3 piece back, and is of a wood that compliments the top, that helps. The top is important, too, because if it is laminate or a poor quality tonewood it will affect the sound ot the guitar. Sometimes the finish used can be harmful to sound, and that depends on the process of finishing and what is used.Check out this site, and don't buy it until you've played it!  http://www.pantheonguitars.com/tonewoods...|`|pS02JGTUaa	thats a beautiful acoustic.  ive never used a fender one, but i'm guessing that it'd work great (:

Memoirs of a Geisha was banned in China because of fears of anti-Japanese retaliations. Brokeback Mountain was also banned there because homosexuality is taboo in China.    Bruce Almighty was banned in Burma, Malaysia and Egypt ue to pressure from Islamic religious circuits who objected to the portrayal of God as a visually ordinary man.

IGz2wBj5aa	Major chords get easier. Trust me. Once your fingers get used to it ( give it weeks, maybe ever months) you'll be flying through those chords like nothing! Also you might want to look up some different tunings. For example I use, Standard (EADGBe), Drop D (DADGBe), whatever this one is called (DADGAe), and Open E (EBEG Be)|`|ZzBGpGudaa	This question is pretty vague...    I guess if your looking for an easier way to play the chords all I can tell you is, you guessed it, practice. After a while your fingers will get more flexible and you'll be able to position them in those tough positions easier.    I know this isn't the answer you were looking for, but there isn't a quick and easy way to learn any instrument.  Good Luck
9HqY9Mtlaa	I know one thing... they were wildout for doing that. I was like what the hell and started laughing out loud in the theater.

cfdcea076742739e75b363443aad92a9aa	I watch several streaming movies/shows daily, and never had any issues, even HD streaming movies.    But I have read on the site, from other members that some movies have audio/video sync issues.        Read comments, from the movie you are trying to watch and see if others, have the same issue.     If not, then try contacting customer service, they alway's answer within a few rings.     Also internet servers can get congested at specific times, slowing down internet speeds.     Good luck !

HgeBc8IPaa	no - not bad - but your tenses are all screwy - it needs a little work.  For example, ...she always says my sister will not tell my parents..."  does not translate to "Ella siempre dice que mi hermana no les diga a mis padres."    It should be "Ella siempre dice que mi hermana no les dira a mis padres."    However, if you said that to a Spanish speaker, they would most likely understand what you are saying anyway...|`|JReroESmaa	you have some mistakes there ;)|`|zMAalpG5aa	Great Job! 2 things:  1) I believe that in the second sentence of the second paragraph, it is Ella siempre dice que mi hermana no les dige a mis padres.  2) manana has an enye.

Whitney's 1991 singing of the national anthem was the best but I'd say Jennifer's is right behind her.|`|AA11522290	Carrie Underwood is the best.

In 2006 their bassist Tye Zamora left the band and decided to go to college. But In 2008 they said that all the Original members got back together, and right now the band is touring around America.    They released a compilation album in 2008, and their last album b4 that was is 2006 called Up In the Attic... so their still around and kicking!|`|1SnI86BIaa	1 hit wonder..|`|EWE5BMLKaa	People realised that they only liked them for their cover songs... which was one song. You can go far on one album (Sex pistols), But you can't go far on one song.

More people die from alcohol every day, and it is not very often you hear of someone dying due to marijuana use. the whole thing is insane. if they made it legal they could tax the hell of it, and pull us out of our  gijillion dollar debt. if everyone that was in prison on marijuana charges was released due to it becoming legal, we would save a **** load more money, and actually have room for some real criminals.   sorry, had to go off on that one, if i could give you 10 stars, i would.      legalize it!!    :)|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	Weed is the sh**T, but it's overrated...

After that, it's the automated bathroom tasks, getting dressed and breakfast. I don't need to put my face back on (ladies you might even look better with only a light pasting of slap)     As for the Yahoo early in the morning, unfortunately a big fat NO to that one because my laptop is still a bit of a lemon.

AA10677231	I generally laugh, squirm and sometimes flail (unless I am restrained).  Assuming I like the tickler, I tend to playfully taunt or encourage the tickler.  I do like to exact my playful, ticklish revenge, though!    Are you up for a challenge???  ;o}|`|AA11808800	I laugh like crazy on my sides and feet, but I love to be tickled. I sometimes say "that doesn't tickle" through my laughter so they'll tickle more|`|WHifY90Caa	I'm more of a jumper than a laugher.    In fact, I did it a few times this morning on the subway when a friend of mine kept grabbing my knees/thighs.|`|WXAoSr49aa	i normally try to get their hand away and say 'what the hell are you doing!' and laugh.|`|d940b613c72e65dceb131f078c7f061eaa	If it's a surprise, I'll flinch involuntarily and let out a high-pitched laugh or squeak, and any halfway decent tickling continued for more than instant will immediately force me into submission.    If I'm securely bound and know I'm in for a good tickling, then I generally just let myself go, laugh and squirm as much as I feel like doing, and have a thoroughly enjoyable time.|`|xhDdYnHTaa	Well, it depends on where I am being tickled and how, but I usually laugh and squirm, sometimes squeal and kick.

Jz7KDYoEaa	That's the whole Mayan calender thing right? Well, seeing as I believe soothsaying, fortune telling and any other future predicting hoopla is fictictious I say HELL NO! But if you need me to tell ya for sure I'll just hop into that SWEET '85 DeLorean I bought from Christopher Lloyd and see for myself. Wanna come with, it'll be your test drive before you purchase.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	That the Earth will end all existance? People have been saying that for Thousands of years. All hype.|`|7fr5uEX5aa	no|`|dwAZSVFHaa	yes i do|`|MdXwD2JSaa	Nah, just because they have no real hard proof to back it up.  I mean, the Mayans lived thousands of years ago..how are we supposed to know what all their calendar meant?|`|mMcrqP6caa	Negatives|`|Okes2LCuaa	no, i don't believe in it.|`|c034dwWXaa	ok so what is it about 2012 that Im suppose to decide if I belive??|`|sxo9dznQaa	No not really.  The world was supposedly said to end on 666, but nothing happened.    But hey, you never know.|`|XbGkjC4Taa	yeah, lol.  but i don't believe it will happen all of a sudden on 2012.  there has to be some small changes first, which later on lead to the big disasters.|`|i6olxHpvaa	well.....kinda sorta....nah|`|4PWZmVZ4aa	no|`|b9e5f45fb170101f7d4d32dd87e90872aa	Maybe the end as we now know it wont be like it was yesterday|`|fdP9UJOsaa	Yes and i'm scared lol|`|gWleYSuIaa	No, you see I have something the people who beleive in it don't have - i am not a moron.|`|yLoksHiFaa	No, it's BS.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Yes.

Just in case.|`|174hHTXDaa	No.|`|X5F7h3l4aa	i did believe it for about 3 hours then i asked about it on here and their answers were a good slap in the face for me to wake up to myself.    its total BS!    its Zecharia Sitchin's idiotic theory/fantasy about how the planet Nibiru is coming to destroy us and the planet earth will be colonized by an ancient alien race called the anunnaki who come from the same planet system as the rogue nibiru.      this guy thinks we are all clones made for slavery 1000's of years ago for these aliens and the funny thing is he has no proof what so ever to back it up and his prediction for this to happen was in 2003 and it didn't happen so now they say its the 21st of december 2012.    funny how on the last season of the x-files that mulder & scully find out the aliens were gonna come back and reclaim the planet in 2012.  seriously look it up.|`|YlMR42agaa	Yes just like 2000 and 2005 and 2006.|`|I4bALymyaa	NO|`|a5907a0ece688abb64d63e44d7687dceaa	Seriously, what's supposed to happen?|`|h4R4Txjvaa	No, it's just some random thing that they predicted over 2000 years ago who cares.... just live your life to the fullest|`|qYm40x0yaa	NOPE its all gaaarrrbbaaagggeee|`|re06t6zvaa	kind of...i can't wait for the movie :)|`|bn1Cw4sYaa	Hell no.|`|8ea7bf093a6acfbb69fa32bf5c76d57baa	Only if Obama doesn't get a second term!|`|aVGnsATJaa	what 2012 stuff???????????|`|hfRiTud3aa	i don't know|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Not at all. The Earth will be around for a very long time.|`|cf4c77000dd8c8bfd28c8ed28d73c296aa	no but there is always a what if factor|`|RK1AO2Rnaa	no everyone has been predicting the end of the world since the beginning of the world.   everyone thought the world was going to end in 2000 because the western calender ended. what happened? The calender started all over again.   Nostradamus predicted the end of the world would be August 2006. What day is it today hmm?    Same thing in 2012, just because the Mayan calender and the Chinese calendar "end" everyone thinks the world is doomed. everything will be fine. The calenders will just start all over again and we will all continue to live our lives|`|d9cB8yN8aa	No. There will always be people claiming the end of the world is upon us.|`|pJyPrL5Yaa	no. it is going to be just like any other year. will are they saying that? to warn us? we cant do anything about it. well yeah we can we can all pack up and move to other of the planets. =0 argggg.....oh and we can buy spaceships...seriously why are they warning us?. we can pray but thats all we can do.
AuS9UQfQaa	What?  I was distracted by the thing in your display picture.  WHAT IS THAT?    I'm only working part time but my hours have been cut dramatically...    to zero.    I'm still employed...but about 10 others are getting no hours right now as well...|`|AA12383908	I think there will be a lot of people lose their jobs. I don't work but my Husband does and I hope he don't lose his. No I don't think it will be easy to find jobs now.|`|AA10019300	I'm employed in the insurance industry and believe it or not, we're doing OK even during this recession.  Our company invested very conservatively so we're not experiencing massive layoffs.    Maybe I could find a new job, but most likely I would need to move to another city.|`|bgE2gRwSaa	I hope I do...my job sucks!|`|AA11536708	I already did.  I did believe I would find another job easily and quickly.  I am an excellent employee, with excellent references.  I thought I'd be back on the horse in no time.  That was in October.  I received my first interview (I have been sending out resumes since I lost my job) on Thursday.  It went very well.  The guy said he received over 300 resumes in response to his posting.  He was doing telephone interviews first (which is what I had), of the top few resumes, then from that he would choose who he really interviewed.    I hope to be one of the ones to receive the "real" interview.    We spoke for about 1/2 hour on the phone, at the end he said "It has been a real pleasure speaking with you...truly a delight."      So, I am hopeful.  But, it is a lot tougher out there than ever.|`|rSo5N7pSaa	I have worked same job for well over 20 years and YES I am worried more than ever I did in the past. I am taking one day at a time ....    If I lose it, I doubt I could find a great paying job like this one but I can always find work...|`|8nm2psyKaa	Nope cuz that would mean I'd have to fire myself and that doesn't sound very smart to me...|`|R7vC3ecXaa	i never had a job to lose.. lol :D|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	oh gosh, i certainly hope not.  i have to pay of my school loan.    i don't think i would be able to easily find a job.    |`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	did here a while back|`|rXTufSRRaa	I doubt it because I am a nurse and if I did, nursing jobs are very easy to find|`|48f16lTJaa	I'm just gonna apply for a job..|`|zzivfC0qaa	I already did sir. :(

o0JOTzj0aa	Man, you have amazing taste!  And while I agree that those bands are awesome, if you're looking for the best ROCK decade, it has to be the 80s.  A lot of the ones you've mentioned are more grunge - Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Nirvana, Pearl Jam...personally, I think I prefer grunge to rock but I still think that the 80s had more typical rock - Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Def Leppard, Whitesnake, etc.  That's more the traditional rock.  But like I say, you've basically listed all my favourite bands lol!!|`|GgWP5Mf2aa	This is mostly an opinion piece. As for your question I would say there is a continual evolution of Rock, so it's all good; 60's Hendrix, 70's Credence Clearwater Revival, 80's Queen, 90's Nirvana.|`|3956c292d9898cc425bc25b7923184b7aa	Good decade.  I could go without the "Peppers" and "Foo Fighters".  No disrespect to Dave Grohl, I like Probot.  And I'm optimistic RATM will reunite in the future.|`|TGOVVZ0zaa	70's|`|PRdlWnvKaa	Yeh definately but you should try listenin to music dating back further    Guns N' Roses  motley crue  ACDC  Metallica  Iron Maiden  Judas Preist  Led Zeppelin  Pink Floyd  Rolling stones    Try some of these im only 17 and started listenin to these when i was 13 and now its all i listen 2 im literally obsessed with rock music. seriously you should like these bands|`|vidiDXxBaa	Nope. Most of the awesome bands released most of their best stuff in the 80s. Examples:  Metallica (all 80s awesome albums)  Megadeth (all really good albums)  Iron Maiden (most of their best stuff)  Exodus  Testament  Slayer  Kreator  Sodom  Sabbat  Onslaught    Should I really go on? Well, the 80s ruled and in my opinion the 90s never got close. Most of the good 90s music was underground. Just my two cents.|`|xwD8PUFlaa	I LOVE 90's grunge & alternative rock, the 90's were no means crap, but I reckon the 80's were better.    I'm 16, born '92, and my favourite eras r the 70's, 80's & 90's, I hate new music with a passion!   Don't listen when people think its weird, bands like Led Zeppelin & Queen peaked in the 70's & people still know (and LOVE) them.    I can guarantee no one will remember flo rida or jonas bothers in 20yrs.    Thats some great music by the way, u stick with that!|`|2YHJZwksaa	To me the 90's where the best for music    Jane's Addiction - Ritual de los Habitual  I Mother Earth - Dig  AIC - Dirt / Facelift  Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream  STP - Core  Soundgarden - Badmotorfinger   The Tea Party - Edges of Twighlight  The Tragically Hip - Fully Completly  Our Lady Peace - Naveed / Clumsy  Tool - Undertow / ?nimea    among others still get a lot of play today    among many others still get a fair amount almost 2 decades later|`|CHVPua7Raa	You have some good taste in music. You should check out "Faith No More" .Bad name great music.  I have to agree for heavy metal the 90's can't be topped , for hard rock it was the 70's. Zeppelin , Pink Floyd, Ted Nugent , Aerosmith etc.|`|rzuEjHpkaa	I think 70's it is  it had The led zeppelin, Queen, Rolling stone, Jimmy hendrix  just go ask your dad about it|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	The 70s|`|AA10098101	The 90's is actually when music died.  Rap and Grunge segregated the rock fanbase, and nearly killed it.      The best decade for rock was the 70's.      Grunge is not good rock.  It's called "grunge" for a reason.  There's no talent involved, it's all about image.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	Well from 1990 to 1996 was the best period for music of the 1990's. Anything after 1996 was utter shite|`|gVVZQ4ikaa	lordavii is so right!!! The best rock music was played in the 70s, the best images was created in the 90s (and later...)  In the 70s there was musicians with a vision, with a clear thought and idea how they wanna sound like. They improvise a lot.   And later on, in the 90s in particular? There was musicians that had a clear thought and idea of how to look and what to say when a microphone was nearby. Twice a day they were checking their bank account.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	I grew up in the 70s.  I can't say I like any particular decade best.  For rock I like some of 70s and some 80s eg. Whitesnake, Iron Maiden, Genesis, WASP.  I wasn't keen on the rock music from the 90s (apart from Thunder), but I did like living through the development of techno/dance/club etc.  I even like some things from way back in the 40s and 50s.  The only decade I don't really like is 60s.|`|EWE5BMLKaa	No mention of Primus, Pavement, Weezer, Lifetime or Kid dynamite?    For shame!|`|U9KJNuq6aa	hell yeah it was!!!    oh and you forgot garbage and NIN and STP and few others that i'm too lazy and tired to type out ;)|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	No, but sounds like you grew up then, so you missed out on other decades.   90's was good, but some of the 80's was great too, 70's was just party party party! Still technically rock, just different styles. :)|`|7i6qj4OXaa	No-one who lived through the 50s and 60s would ever ask this question.  It all evolved from Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard.|`|Ny5FYSvEaa	Definitely.    Metallica - black album  Faith No More - King For A Day  Tool - Aenima  Green Day - Dookie  Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral    And the list goes on.|`|BRVF1b4gaa	NO|`|CEJfiHmJaa	no 60s and 80s were the best|`|sVkSrUqNaa	YES i love the 90s rock|`|pcdrdQHMaa	Yes, I miss the 90's.
YE0baNYRaa	4 coz i easily give into situation that arises. my weakness are sweets n i cant stay without them even wen im on diet. however hard i try.|`|fVob68Liaa	8|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	10    I'm a vegetarian.

9UhoUcM2aa	I like the first and second :) they are super cute|`|73ZquQVwaa	if you look like the girl wearing the tattoo, then by all means get it. but its up to you and its your decision|`|9ilXVowLaa	i have a purple one on my left ankle,with vines intertwined through it.  i adore it.|`|qVhqc019aa	Cute, Im getting about 5..including black angel wings, a star on my wrist, my name on the other and a couple hearts =]    ?|`|qYm40x0yaa	i liked the first pic  u shud get on ur shoulder  dont u think it wud look better there  since it is small??|`|wyIccGvaaa	ii like the second one then the 1st one i think it would be cute, instead of those stupid star && butterfly tattoos! :D|`|AA10415600	1 and 3 all alright.  2 is tacky|`|RbmVnoozaa	as longs as it's not on the lower back, or near the vag, it's not tacky.  but its not like guys really care anyways.|`|0b5OTYbeaa	I like it a lot, and it would probably look bangin' on you girl! The only thing is I don't know about the back of your neck though.|`|RugUki9qaa	Cute...but why get a tattoo depending on what others think? It should be something for YOU.|`|YTLePvkVaa	Ones with meaning are good but these days people just get them to look tough or be kool. The Egyptian one looks good.|`|UYCvwh6Paa	In this order, I like- 2,  1,  3.    I'm a big fan of Egyptian Hieroglyphs and the wispy look of  2 gives the ANKH a feminine, artsy look that I think is pretty.  1 with the wings is really cute, but I'm not much of a fan of the tribal look one because it's hard to make out what it is.
wgYMHW9Naa	I like both but RIGHT NOW, I am wearing a...  ROCKSTAR ENERGY DRINK SHIRT!    That's funny you should ask this question :)|`|nYnlYAE1aa	Monster is the better or the two but I prefer the orange Rip-It|`|6ChuLcvraa	definitely monster|`|AA10409668	Sorry Sugar, but I'm going with Monster on this one.

I took the time to listen to a person I did not even know chat about a person who wrong her. I offer a nice word back to her. It took only a minute but it meant something to this women.

If you think about life logically, you will come to the conclusion that all meaning in life is culturally derived, and there is no point in worrying about it. If you have faith that life has meaning, there is still no point in worrying about it.    p.s. I laugh when atheists say they have "logic" and not "faith." They sure have a lot of faith that they have logic and that their logic is correct. LOL!

Logic is based on fact and rigid discipline. It's often expressed in simple formula that proves truth, such as:    If A is B, and if B is C, then A is C.    If Persians are cats, and if Cats are mammals, then Persians are mammals.    That logical statement is true.|`|AA11082713	two opposites ends of the spectrum...xxx    faith~believing in something from the heart  logic~what's that?|`|7G0IyCltaa	Oxymoronic.|`|yAXrsQiFaa	Faith has nothing to do with logic...|`|ff6a5ab6e35e587fe6f597d10cf70c69aa	I have faith that I can be logical.|`|3IVqoH16aa	Faith:  All we have are varying degrees of faith in things.  No such thing as proof in my opinion, just evidence.    Logic: A tool to look at things in different ways and expose truths that may not have been apparent by just looking at data.  Any logical conclusion is only as good as premises it starts with.  A valid argument can be made from false or faulty premises which will yield a false/faulty conclusion.  And we have no premises which are absolutely true except for ones we define such as 1 inch = 25.4mm.  So any logical conclusion has varying degrees of shakiness depending on how much faith we have in the premises.    Just my opinion.  Not the word of god or anything like that.

NqcnAnC1aa	Want pale skin?  Stay out of the sun and use a lot of sunscreen if you do go out.  As for hair, dye it a nice dark brown color.  Keep your makeup minimal but wear a nice natural shade of red on your lips, and a little bit of eye liner/mascara on your eyes.  As for clothing, I don't know what she wears...but I'm sure if you did some research on her you could copy her style pretty easily.    And I know you don't wanna hear this, but nobody likes a poser/fake.  You should really just be yourself.  You're probably too young right now though to even know what that means..

dvUS0HHXaa	Transformer - Commercially successful but also very musically accomplished. Great album that really cemented his career after the Velvet Underground    Berlin - One of the great overlooked albums of all time. Brilliant lyrics and a fantastic idea, however in terms of commercial success and appeal a lot of people didn't really 'get it'. I can see he wanted to make this his piece de resistance but many people just wrote it off saying that it was bland and did not live up to Transformer.    I myself cannot choose one over the other, they both really are very good.|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	Hey Syd!    Great question!!    I've never heard "Berlin" but I love "Transformer."  The lyrics remind me of Bob Dylan.  One of my favorite songs is 'A Walk on the Wildside'.  It is such a unique and inventive song.  The bass has an erie sound - you feel like your are being taken on a journey, like listening to 'The End' by The Doors.  'Wildside' is one of my favorite songs.    I will pick up "Berlin" soon.|`|3JRUgVhraa	Personally i preferred Transformer.|`|xBiLoU8Laa	How can you ask this question? They are both so good you cant possibly say one is better than the other. Lou Reed is like a god in these two albums and its just impossible to say one is better than the other.    Btw check out if you haven't Berlin: Live At St. Ann's Warehouse its is an awesome way to see and hear the Berlin album

OPKbGXUFaa	I agree,  America is not about being Christian,    however, if you said something that was racist or sexist, the Get out of America quote can apply.|`|mMcrqP6caa	Religion causes nothing but dramas|`|ZbZw82rOaa	the "multi-racial" & "multi religious" $hit is just a cover up to convince people that America is a good country|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Get out!|`|un0C52G8aa	Their dream is to turn the country into a theocracy.|`|zzivfC0qaa	Dude America was founded because the founding fathers came to escape religious oppression, I think like the founding fathers there is no better land you could be in then the good ole USA. I think they should take a look at the bill of rights, we don't have a mandatory religion we have to follow, I say F THEM! As an American Citizen you are entitled to choose what you believe in or what you don't believe in.  Don't listen to these FKS do your own thing and keep on living. :D|`|2QFe7onpaa	You can always turn it around. If they don't like it, they can move. America is free. Just avoid those people. That's what I do. I'm agnostic, pro-choice, Democrat, and a vegetarian. The only thing that could add to that was if I was gay. Lol.    Embrace who you are and ignore ignorant people.|`|d9cB8yN8aa	People who say things like that are neither true Christians nor true Americans. Some accepting nation we are, huh?     I said the same thing to my friend one time, but for a different reason. He for some reason hates the United States, and thinks that everyone here is stupid and fat. He had been going on like that for awhile to me, and finally one of our Canadian friends joined in, and I just couldn't take it anymore, and said, "Well, if you don't like it, then go back to France." Oops.|`|r7aTojwZaa	If those people are pissing you off, just come up here to canada... We really dont care what religion you are. Atheists dont come banging on the door @ 8:45...|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	I think some people are Ignorant.|`|JIvuToXVaa	It's because the US was founded by Christians on Christian morals.  It only started going downhill as it has gone away from those morals.|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Think America was based on Christianity-so deal with it. Aren't you just trying to shove your beliefs down other people's throats?  And we're joking that America is based on tolerance-does anyone out there remember the natives that were here first-oh yes they were really tolerated.|`|l1pewZpaaa	Pilgrims first came to America because of religious oppression, so I say be whatever religion (or not religion) you want, and don't listen to people who think you have to conform to their ideas|`|e28P8gWraa	If we enjoy our religious freedoms we have to let others do the same.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	If you don't like their freedom to tell you to get out then get out
UyULJUx1aa	I keep getting dragged into being "helpful"... I come on Y!A becasue, well, because my life sucks a55 and I just want to zone out and laugh at something.

gDEFlWnOaa	By Alanis Morissette? I love that song...    An old man turned ninety-eight  He won the lottery and died the next day  It's a black fly in your Chardonnay  It's a death row pardon two minutes too late  And isn't it ironic... don't you think    It's like rain on your wedding day  It's a free ride when you've already paid  It's the good advice that you just didn't take  Who would've thought... it figures    Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly  He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye  He waited his whole damn life to take that flight  And as the plane crashed down he thought  "Well isn't this nice..."  And isn't it ironic... don't you think    It's like rain on your wedding day  It's a free ride when you've already paid  It's the good advice that you just didn't take  Who would've thought... it figures    Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you  When you think everything's okay and everything's going right  And life has a funny way of helping you out when  You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up  In your face    A traffic jam when you're already late  A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break  It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife  It's meeting the man of my dreams  And then meeting his beautiful wife  And isn't it ironic...don't you think  A little too ironic...and, yeah, I really do think...    It's like rain on your wedding day  It's a free ride when you've already paid  It's the good advice that you just didn't take  Who would've thought... it figures    Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you  Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out  Helping you out|`|IpPpfREeaa	you can find here & download songs|`|okfTDJ7taa	I like this site as it has lyrics and a forum as to what the song may be about and other info

I learned along time ago that it isn't the height, weight and pants size that counts, it's how your curves suite your bone structure.    I'm not overly heavy for my frame and I'm not tiny. To be honest, I'd rather be 5'6" and wear a size 16 with my big boned frame, than try to slim down into a size 5.

If you can find someone serving a good single origin espresso from Mexico you should find this to be very delicate.      Coffee education has a long long way to go, mostly a reflection of powerful international coffee brands spending vast amounts on highly persuasive advertising whilst driving the costs of production ever lower in the extreme pursuit of profit.    Don't get us wrong, all businesses need to trade at a profit in the long run, its just the passing off of low grade products as high quality products that irks us.|`|ERGGLvYiaa	Deux...Hit me Sgt!!!!!!!!!!!

4g8iBYEJaa	I HATE her.  1) She can sing, but not so amazingly that she should be famous. She can sing as well as 100% of my grade!  2) She takes slutty pictures,and sends them to other ppl/ keeps them saved. And if she send them to other ppl or saves them on her computer then doesn't she WANT somebody to see them?Being a celebrity she should know hacking can happen-- especially if you'ree a top teen pop star like her. This is pretty bad since there have been so many [ slutty pictures] of them out there.  3) She's dating a guy four years older than her. This necessarily isn't that bad, but she's sixteen for Christ's sake! She is a MINOR, while he is an ADULT! She should at least date guys her age or wait until she's at least twenty. And you can also tell he using her for fame since all her does is talk about HIS music.  4) Children who are four years old watch her show. FOUR YEARS old! It teaches them to be a diva, spoiled and a little HM zombie! She is supposed to be in high school in the show!  5)She blames the press for being so hard on her. Well, you'rEEOe a CELEBRITY. You know what that means? It means that we will be watching your every move. Being famous has it costs, just like that black pruis Daddy just bought you.    Miley Cyrus doesn't deserve to be famous... she only is because of her famous father.     I'm proud to be a Hater.    100 x thumbs down for Miley.  |`|1UOIoOzKaa	I hate her  Though she's funny to laugh at|`|GmGogzsXaa	used to like her   see the word "used" in that sentence    I HATE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|3rrJRHrdaa	Haha chick fight is about to happen! But I liked her until like a week ago when I found out what a spoiled brat she is! So I'm a HATER!!|`|AA12212403	I think she's over-popularized to make money.  They will use her and when she grows up and isn't as cute, they will discard her.  What an industry, someone can make so much money when they are that young.  It distorts a person's values.  I worry about what society has done to certain young people.  Look at what has happened to Brittany, yikes!  She's a pretty girl that should be in a normal life, in a normal high school, in a normal town, instead she has been over sensualized and I think it's sad.  Can she ever have a real boyfriend or husband, one day, without worrying that they are using her for her money.  All the money in the world can't buy happiness, look at those who have been arrested for drugs and in rehab so many times.  Shopping and spending a million dollars in a day, drinking, driving, partying, gets Brittany and Lindsay Loham and Paris Hilton in trouble, and I think Miley will be that way in about 3 or 4 years.  Sad, but true.|`|1xKS2ak6aa	LOL  This is for the haters :)    im a hater too    http://www.usmagazine.com/photos/stars-f...    hahaha|`|x6rHjPIIaa	hater here. i so don't got miley.|`|Qg8CI9bXaa	hate her!!!!!!!!!!|`|p0a1dB28aa	I hate all the hype around Miley C.

Tweens look up to her, but she takes soft porn pics of herself and her "boyfriend" who seems to have no interest in her whatsoever. And you now what I heard? She wanted a tattoo of her bf Justin Gaston and have a $1000 a day allowance!! Good examples to kids? I don't think so!|`|H2Cdy9Foaa	I hate her...|`|vkwbaZAAaa	i used to look up to her but she turned into a tart|`|f4ehvRQlaa	I Love Miley Because shes so awesome and beautiful and cute!

(Tomorrow is his 1st ann. Today's gran's.)     Till now I still pictured my great gran in my yard, sweeping (she's always sweeping on the front yard), and I sometimes joked my cousin  (who died) when I'm alone, I know he still somewhere out there. But you know, time heals fast, I just feeling sad and desperate to see them again, 'cause thinking about them hurts a lot. Well, life's just bitter sometimes.

You could be at the bus depot talking with the ladies about tips for curling your hair.  Your shiny *pink* hair, which is just so "cute" with your tight little Britney-esque belly shirt.  O_o    (honestly...there was a guy at the bus terminal today, at my end doing the drag-queen thing, and poorly.

NmSSKnnWaa	probably have to say the wrestler
IlsDo8jqaa	No, it's not true. They may have not had any in but it is NOT out of print.    It's called Death Note: Another Note: The Los Angels BB Murder Case and it's basically this person from Wammy's House, named Beyond Birthday,  who instead of wanting to be like L, he wanted to surpass L and went around killing people in order to create an unsolvable case for L. L got Naomi Misora, the girl who was engaged to the FBI Agent Kira killed, to help him solve the case.    L's last 23 Days, or L Change the World, is not available in English yet. It is about L's last 23 days to live and his last case. There is a virus that someone, K, is trying to spread. The virus has no cure and is extremely deadly. L has to solve who's spreading the virus, why one Boy was not is not affect, and one girl as well. I don't know much else I can tell you about this one without giving away the ending...    Anyways, I hope I've helped you.|`|0MYJwpZ2aa	I haven't heard of How To Read going out of print. You can probably buy it at borders (I saw it there). The extra case L works on in L.A. is called "Death Note: Another Note- Los Angeles B.B. Murder Cases"  It's a good book, and if you like Death Note I'd recommend buying it.  It's not written by the people who wrote the Death Note series, but it is still good.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	the "how to read" is NOT out of print go to chapters or borders or somethign and you will find it.

kI8T2iCraa	They'll grow out of it. What can I say it's a phase. Punk used to be more than just a fashion statement, and Goth used to be a state of mind. Now they're both idiotic skulls and black eyeliner. I'll tell you why! It'a because tiny people are being exposed to it, that's why! It's sad how no one can find their own way any more. I had this cute leather wrist band which had a really awsome skull and crossbones on it. It was very piraty and I love wearing it (I was in my pirate phase after Pirates of the Caribbean 2 came out) This was before everyone started wearing them. I also had a sort of pirate medallion. I wore them all the time and it just so happened that I was partial to black at that time, more than any other color. Everyone told me I looked like a Goth and they even went so far as to call me a devil worshipper. That's when I noticed that the Goth and Punk scenes was rising and people were starting to hate it. Even my teachers commented on it. People started asking me whether I was Punk, Goth or Emo, which I found super retarded. I don't know where these kids get it, but I'm so glad my school years ended at beginning of this very "dark" era, so to speak :D  I'm just glad I didn't see the worst of it.|`|x8mHnT2jaa	because some girls are stupid...thats simple...that's really stupid...i listen to bands like Motley Crue, Cinderella, Ratt ect. ect. and i people at my school will be shocked but they never said anything like that..this one girl decided she was going to listen to whatever and dress in all black and now she thinks she so cool and when i talk about music she gives me these stupid looks like i have no idea what im talking about.|`|AA10098101	Rock is about expressing yourself and being an individual who loves music.  Too many young people today have the "I'm different just like everybody else!" thinking, and really it is still the same "follow the pack and don't think for yourself" mentality.      I listen to so many different kinds of music, most people wouldn't believe me.  I classify myself as a rocker, because that seems to be where some of the most heartfelt, passionate music makers are.  I have never tried to dress some way just because someone else did; the most I can be accused of is seeing something that I like and trying it.  Sometimes it just doesn't work for me.  I have long hair and it works.  I tried to dye it black one time (I'm naturally blonde) and it didn't (luckily I used a temporary dye and was able to completely wash it out in about a week).  Individualism is rock.  Conformity is not.|`|U9KJNuq6aa	probably because teenagers (especially around that age) are very superficial and don't know much about life. you know whats really ironic is that a lot of teenagers try so hard to dress a certain way thinking it makes them different, when in reality they look the same as everyone else who is trying to look different.|`|ONuy5vniaa	For some people of both sexes this doesn't end at 13-14.    The fact is that its trendy to look a part and to think you are the best at looking that part, especially when people are at a young age.    Eventually, most learn that it is not the clothes you wear or the labels you obtain, it is nothing more then heart and mind.

EQ9k2Gbyaa	Before deciding, here are some things that I think are important to consider:    a) YOUR AUDIENCE: Bands with female singers tend to attract a primarily female crowd. The music your playing however (and yes, I do despise this) has a larger male fan base. This creates a contradiction that could cause problems, so you need to consider b)    b) YOUR MUSIC: If you want a female singer, perhaps go for something like Patty Smith or Hole - Rock songs that were written for a female voice. They will not only sound better, but are also hugely popular among females (and famous enough that you may get the guys interested in hearing you too) meaning that your music and your audience will be more in sync. If you want to stick with AC/DC, I'd definitely go for a male singer.    c) YOUR VALUES: What's most important to you; Cranking up the Girl Power, or playing the music you want to play and making it sound the way you want it to sound? If you don't like listening to female rock singers then you may not like listening to your own female fronted band.    SO, i'd either go with the male singer, or chose music that was written for a female voice.    good luck!|`|uO8sFIuCaa	An alto will make all the male songs sound fantastic.    A woman with a deep voice sounds great for rock, it's really interesting, but might limit who hires you (some people, like yourself, really don't like the "wrong gender" singing their favourite songs)    if you find a girl whos great, use her, if a guy is best, use him... but don't pick a shitty guy iver a great girl, just because he is a guy.|`|MX7eJqfFaa	Weather you choose to have only girls or a male singer, i would try recruiting, like if you have a guitar center around where you guys live then I would recommend to put some fliers of your band looking for a singer in the place where they have the bill board. Best of luck to you guys.|`|GzlckRcnaa	if you think male can sing rock better,why not have male singer?..or if you sing better than them,no|`|aw2xkdSbaa	Find the best singer for your band, regardless of gender. Unfortunatley, with co-ed bands, there are usually misconceptions. An all male band with a female singer: the singer looks like the band ****. All female band with a male singer: you look like the singer's harem.  Its not a fair observation, but its what some think. If you do go co-ed, do NOT mix business and pleasure (if you know what i mean). I've been in two co-ed bands and both broke up because of 2 members end up dating and then turning the band into their personal soap opera.|`|ceF5X2m7aa	if you found a good male singer use him..  and thats not common too.. all girls but the singer..   i think that'd be a sick look..|`|1UGonfosaa	i think that male  singers sound better but you should try to be an all-girl rock band coz 1 male and 4-5 girls :/ i dont know:D  Good luck!:)  x|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	I just keep thinking of that horrible 'Robert Palmer' video from the 80's, stick to the all girl line up, it sounds great!

WpA7n8Iwaa	They sneak it in on so many things!  Basically, the more it's processed, the more you should avoid it.  I have changed my diet so much over the years - more and more natural every year.

I think the major problem is that many of us cannot afford $7.00 for a gallon of milk, $8.00 for a box of cereal, $15.00 for a couple bags of veggies or fruits at the whole/organic food stores.    Eating healthy, truly healthy, is *EXTREMELY* expensive.    I do the best I can, and when I eat healthier, I certainly do feel better.  But I doubt I will ever be able to afford an entire unprocessed, organic grocery list (unless we get rich, lol).|`|LoRgAmc6aa	I have not because with the high prices of fresh meats and fresh produce, it's too expensive. I mean, I have a family and other bills to pay so I can't exactly afford a huge grocery bill. Plus, I work full time, go to college part time and sometimes depend on packaged foods for my family.     I have cut my portion sizes and lost 27 lbs as a result.

qQNevrv5aa	It's A New Day by Will.I.Am
AA11601079	I really liked the film, but I do think it's being overrated at this point. I think there are two reasons that it's getting the accolades that it's received:    1) The film is a complete underdog, much like the character in the movie. It's about orphans in India, it doesn't have any big names, and it was supposed to go straight to video. Now, it's poised to win Best Picture. Hollywood loves these come-from-behind stories, whether on film or in real life. This has both.    2) It's a completely predictable story, but the film is still better than many of the others that came out this year. "Benjamin Button" is kind of like "Forrest Gump" all over again, except with news footage from Katrina rather than a good soundtrack. "The Reader" was only made to try to get Kate Winslet an Oscar. "Milk" was OK, better known for its performances than its story, which is sad since the story is so intriguing. And I don't think I know anyone who bothered to see "Frost/Nixon" yet. So, "Slumdog" is being hyped because it's the "best" picture, not because it's a "great" picture, per se.|`|4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	Yes, I do. I thought it was okay, but nothing really special.|`|b8931e7bd3b4a0a685d8c8fbc06dabf4aa	No way! It really brings out a message!|`|c3vd6UvNaa	I hated it. I didn't get around to watching it until last week because director Danny Boyle has long been on my "Life is Too Short for..." list. But this one seemed unavoidable.     I regretted my decision from the opening sequence, which intercuts an interrogation on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" with the eye-candy torture (beating, high-voltage toe-shocking) of a kid who's tied up and suspended from the ceiling -- all with thudding music (just like the TV game show!) and Dutch angles galore. (The television show is black and blue; the torture chamber is orange and red -- all glossy as can be.) This is Danny Boyle, slumming. Like its title, "Slumdog Millionaire" is so picturesquely "gritty" it's unctuous. Even the cruelty is pristine. Casting is skin-deep: The good characters are pretty, the mean ones are distinguished by facial scars and/or disorders, the slimy ones are, well, slimy-looking.    Not since "Crash" -- or possibly "Mississippi Burning" -- has a movie packaged brutality in slicker, shinier, tighter shrink-wrap. You will never have to worry about what you are supposed to feel and when you are supposed to feel it because the movie will always feed you the answers, then smack you when it's your cue to emote. You can "surrender" completely to the experience (it demands nothing less), and you needn't worry that you will be given an idle moment in which you will be left to feel, or breathe, on your own. This is the kind of mechanical spectacle people like to call an "audience picture," but that's simply because it doesn't allow any space for non-autonomic responses. Don't even get me started on the schematic, dramatically flat structure (game show question followed by flashback to how how the contestant learned the answer)...    But then again, I know I'm in the minority here. It's nominated for ten Oscars, and will probably win a bunch of them. With the possible exception of Best Editing, it will not deserve them.|`|Qt1rqPOoaa	It is not.

ZdAGJPlqaa	How indeed! Ten years or so ago we had an ice storm that knocked out electricity at my house for two weeks.  I lived way out in th country at the time and the back roads were so bad they were impassable. We couldn't get out and help couldn't get in  We gathered wood and cooked on my wood stove, which was also the only source of heat, we had to melt ice for water and bathing as our well froze up too.  Toward the end it rained and I wanted a shower so badly that I actually went outside and washed my hair under the rain spout in the freezing cold.  We had been told a storm was coming so I had stocked up on canned goods and bought something called chicken in a can, it was cheaper than than the canned chicken or tuna you buy for salads so I thought I had made a good deal but when I opened it up there was a whole chicken inside, skin, bones and all, an entire small chicken! I though it looked horrible and wouldn't eat it!  We laugh about it now and I was kind of proud of myself for being able to "rough it" for a while but it isn't something I'd want to do again!    Edit-I didn't know what a Jaffa was!    Fireman Bob! Elvis was my Mothers, I rocked to Lynyrd Skynyrd! Unfortunatly with the electric out and being afraid to use up my batteries I only listened to news and played board games till it got dark, then lit lanterns and told ghost stories!|`|raU9c3tzaa	what do you mean by How could they have possibly coped????  we have a diesel generator, and the village may go out of power for like 24 hours, and nothing happens. you can cook on wood, you can light a candle, and stuff. so me dont get your point.  edit : me gets your point now mr.  spectre.  jafa, as fas as me knows is:  * a type of electronic inscription .  ** a type of oranges.  *** a city in the middle-east.  **** a type of spaghetti takes 2 hours to cook.  ***** a knock -off brand name pink snuggie with a wide longitudinal back vent.  ****** a super glue made of snails.  hope that helps. lol|`|gAOAdOHraa	Love NZ, but that sucks!

8b4b7257f99aa7453844e30ba950e978aa	Any tiny change in something complicated can drastically alter what that thing does. For example, with cars, if you don't have a spark plug, you're not going anywhere. This tiny little piece has changed a vehicle in to the worlds largest paperweight. Just tell a story about something small making a big difference. It not necessarily a mechanical thing either. For example, take one day and whenever you see someone you recognize, smile at them. You'll be surprised at the difference this simple task makes (assuming you're not incredibly happy ALL the time right now. :P).
R7VjuCT2aa	Explain that life without love is empty and would be the same as the world not moving/spinning which would be dark and cold.    Love is like the sunshine and the moonlight which allow you to see clearly during the day (happiness) and provide enough moonlight at night (depression) to get through until daylight returns.

DcCECelaaa	My first reaction would be to let nature take it's course and not intervene.  But we humans can't seem to stop intervening in the balance of nature so what the heck -- impose your own human values on that moment if you so choose.    If the bird were too far gone, I wouldn't bother trying to assist unless you recognized the snake as being poisonous or dangerous to humans and this were a frequently traveled nature walk path.  Save a bird but kill a snake?  Net Net, have you done the right thing though?    If you tried to help the bird, of course use some extension device like a long branch or cane to manipulate the snake within a safer striking distance.  But get to know your snakes so you don't go fooling with something that could bite and kill you.    This would be a good question to ask a snake wrangler.  Call your local zoo and listen to their advice.  Personally, I like birds more and snakes less so I might try to help the bird if it wasn't too far gone or I was confidant it could fly away and not just die a slow death from having been bitten.  But I'd need to be more confident about what kind of snake it was.      Generally, snakes with elliptical pupils are the poisonous ones while those with circular pupils may not be poisonous.       Many snakes also eat rodents and other pests so they can be friends to humans in our habitats.  Generally, naturalists have a healthy respect for the forces and the balance of nature so if one animal is fighting or eating another, they leave it alone unless to let the survivor live would pose an even greater threat to humans.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	It's called nature. I'd expect it on a nature walk.|`|VvMquavyaa	Id leave it alone?  Its what snakes do, you know.|`|BLXwZAfqaa	Take video.  Snakes gotta eat too.|`|jRNexOtWaa	Just ignore it, or giggle by myself!

Let the thumbs down rain upon me.|`|lgNr4wVIaa	I don't understand the hype of it, I've never read it, but from reviews etc. I'm assuming it's a love story about a vampire.  There are plenty of books out there that are like that, and probably has better dialogue.  I'm not trying to be condescending, but I think the reason why every other teenage girl is into this series is because their friends are into it.  They're all conforming.|`|ZfWMnvW7aa	i think this is a no brainer lol|`|wtjb0UuXaa	the book was okay, but the movie sucked.|`|cLGVSuFqaa	beyond  i think im addicted|`|m5aenb6qaa	Yes I do!

nYnlYAE1aa	If I'm having cramps I will take a pain reliever and lie tummy-down on a warm heating pad. I can't live without my heating pad!! It really does ease the pain.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Drink water and take Midol.|`|Ua7kJ6Tzaa	Taking a shower always helps for me...also just sleeping is really good. Have you seen your doctor? If it's like REALLY bad cramps, there might be something wrong. =x To hide it..well lets just say I wear black for a while...and try not to cross your legs too much.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Lots of ibuprofen or Advil and super absorbency Tampons    Oh and dark pants lol    Rw|`|k6M48eUMaa	Well I usually just take a tablet and lay down when I have a tummy ache, and thank gawd its never went through for me in public but its happened at home, so I just tell my mum and she washes it for me :)|`|8C824cthaa	Well im going to the doctor soon because i have had SEVER CRAMPS i am so sick of it. I am very athletic. and Advil used to help me not at all. i wish i could help you. all i would say is pain re leaver ALSO you can also heat up a heating tube/bag what ever and place it a little bellow tummy. feels nice  :)|`|2aa7f3581ca7a75ce4b41ed0be249da6aa	I can tell you a rarely known remedy and trust me it works!! Take 2 Ginger caplets/pills with a glass of warmer water (a little warmer than warm but not HOT) and make sure you've eaten. Lay down and rest. Make sure you're able to sleep uninterrupted. I guarantee when you wake up you will feel nothing...and you'll feel so much better. Take my word for it. Get well soon...  **Also darker colored panties and jeans, sweat pants, skirt, whatever you're wearing will help. Also spray your undergarments and pad/tampon with a light feminine spray so you can feel a little fresher and control any odor that may occur.|`|zAhwN8ueaa	hot bags, water, midol, anti diareaha pills and sleep.|`|e28P8gWraa	My ex had to start taking birth control to fix her severe cramps, and well switch out pads and tampons more regularly. Its nothing to be ashamed of.|`|AA12383908	Take pamprin or midol. if you go through tie your jacket around you until you can get home.|`|5haXKcIuaa	u can get yourself on the birthcontrol to prevent cramps and stomach aches.. or get somehting warm on ur tummy drink warm stuff aswell...and i dont know about that one it has nevr happened to me.|`|RugUki9qaa	I drink some beer and take some midol|`|sDHxandWaa	Take Midol, or if you don't really like pills (like me lol) you could always try a nice long hot shower/bath. Hot water bottles and electric blankets help. Basically, anything with a lot of warmth will probably help, but Midol will do it. (I've also taken Excedrin Migraine before for cramps, and it does wonders too)    I've never tried to hide my period, I just wear looser clothes like sweat pants and whatnot. Can't really hide it anyway, since I'm usually reaaaallllyyyy bitchy during my period.|`|AA11558801	i know its gross when it goes through, but like should it REALLY be embarrassing?? like if someone makes fun of me or something, i say" well no duh! im a fricken girl! im sorry i cant keep my pants clean from blood!"  :)|`|xy4z8bQraa	hahaha|`|EIr9e67eaa	I heard bananas help cramps, or stretch your stomach.    And always bring an extra pad or tampon!

OR you can just call your mom and go home and change.|`|pYpXj7gOaa	if you;re worrried it will leak then wear a long shirt like a babydoll top or something and wear dark pants.|`|22hX0vDNaa	hmmm well stomach pain:  either curl up in feetal position or take tylenol/ibeprophen/other pain killers    When the blood seeps through, go buy a tampon or pad that will prevent further blood. and try to hide it with a shirt and wrap jacket around your waist.|`|HgeBc8IPaa	stretching always helps cramping even though it's the last thing you feel like doing hen you're in pain.    If it goes through, you need top revisit the products you are using.  Maybe switch to tampons + ultra thin pad?      I guess if you need to hide a stain, wrapping a sweater around your waist or making sure to wear long tops when you're on your period.|`|8lMaJ8nGaa	take midole as soon as possible drink a lot of water take a hot shower or go to your doctor if it is really bad|`|Om4oZd3Vaa	I take ibuprofen.    If you're in school, take spare pants/underwear to change in case you slip up.  I haven't slipped up in a while.  Pantie liners help.    Don't be afraid to leave class to use the restroom.  Most teachers understand, especially if you give them the "it's urgent" look.|`|tK5swgX1aa	it depends on the situation, if it's around people I try to wrap up in a sweater or coat until i can make it to the bathroom or my room to change|`|ldcs7OdXaa	I started takign the depo shot; i barely ever get cramps anymore OR my period!

mXDCnXOhaa	I do not know for sure, it will cause a ton of problems and Yahoo! does not like problems! But, it will only cause problems because the majority of Yahoo! Answers users are against bestiality, and there would probably be legal issues. Although, bestiality is not illegal everywhere, as some people claim. As far as I see it, as long as the majority of Yahoo! Answers users are against bestiality, there will not be a bestiality section.

WtjbCSnSaa	This is the only one that I could find that even came close to your lyrics above.  You didn't give me a lot of information to work with.    DAYLIGHT    How I knew you'd be gone from the time you were born  And it came right through to the cloud that you're on    Dawn of this stuff wasn't nearly enough  Though I thought it would keep you here  When the sun came up boy you disappeared    How the years carry on and some go in between  And it takes much more than at first you'd believe  Now the sun from the fields glowing hot and everything turns to gray  And the sun went down and all this went away    Will ever I remember what to say and what you seem to find?  And I had never heard you call for me outside    Outside    There's a story I've told that I want you to hear  Doesn't mean run now even though it's unclear  What if our time was no way to become though I thought it would keep you here  When the day was done it all disappeared    Will ever I remember what to say and what you seem to find?  Suddenly I'm not the only one in daylight  And everything will stay the same for me    The changing of the tide  And I had never heard you call for me outside    Oh, everything will stay the same for me  The changing of the tide  And I had never heard you call for me outside    Outside
IMoX3RcJaa	There is as big a variety of Hentai as there is real life pornography.  Rape, gore, and fantasy/sci-fi scenarios just seem to be pretty popular topics..|`|sosisPXbaa	a lot is like that but not all of it.   theres hentai's for any fetish you can think of.  including women dominating men.  dont ask me how i know LOL|`|0wr04D57aa	The word hentai translates to "sexually perverted", which seems to be what you got. Animation is like the only form in which rape can legally be depicted. Only sickos want to watch a real girl get raped and hurt, but lots of people(both genders) fantasize about it. So they started drawing it. Almost all anime, the non-sexual stuff, has a young-looking girl in next to nothing(usually a school girl outfit), and some sort of creature with extremities that are phallic. It's perverted in the extreme. Lots of people like it. I am a bit bossy, and I almost always dominate the conversation and the people around me. I love hentai movies because in them I can pretend it's otherwise. Alot of people are like that. I have a question for you. You say the movie was mostly depictions of that. Does that mean you watched the whole thing? Despite being grossed out? Liking it doesn't mean you'd really do it or anything.|`|wCb8nuNlaa	i dunno, but my suggestion is dont even get into Hentai. I know it will take all the manga/anime innocence right out of you. its a good thing u feel grossed out, now you know
8Bl3DvVqaa	it's called "I Know What You Are" by Carter Burwell,  he also does "Bella's Lullaby" & both these can be found on the Twilight Soundtrack.
bmrf1vdiaa	Oh, I've never heard anything like that before! But, uhm, it's absolutely fun to think about.
dIuOXR11aa	1982 it was destroyed. Plenty of remakes, w/, by some original video, castings, members, (etc.)  peoples.... Good luck!
c3vd6UvNaa	There are *some* similarities to City of God, except that's a crime film and it's a better movie, IMO.    Millions is a feel-good family film that's from the same director and is less unsettling.    There are probably several Bollywood films that are a lot like Slumdog Millionaire, but I wouldn't know anything about that.
Klw3Ke3Haa	I am not sure but you can probably try a blog site or use the power of google to find plenty of useful and helpful sites for you to use. Good Luck!

JQJvW4KSaa	Learn the songs you want to play, start by learning about 3 chords a week. There's no point in learning songs that are easy, try to learn the songs you like. You can usually find any song by searching Google for '____ tabs'.    Also, a capo isn't going to make your guitar quieter, a capo is for a continual bar chord or something, I know it's definitely not for volume.  If it's too loud, either project your voice better or strum softer. :P|`|bribxhsdaa	If you're guitar is loud...Treat it gently. A lot of people just hammer it with a really forceful strum.    You can actually play Apologize without a capo if you tune down a half step (But that's not really what you wanna get into when you're just learning)    Some easy songs....    "Smells Like Teen Spirit" - Nirvana   "All Along The Watchtower" - Bob Dylan  "Hey There Delilah" - Plain White T's  "Mrs Officer" - Lil Wayne  "Californication" - The Red Hot Chilli Peppers  "Smoke On The Water" (intro riff) - Deep Purple  " Iron Man" (intro riff) - Black Sabbath  "House Of The Rising Sun" - The Animals    A Great place to learn from his Justin Sandercoe's channel on youtube...he gives really good explanations on how to play songs..    www.youtube.com/justinsandercoe  www.youtube.com/justinsandercoesongs|`|ITYgBMJPaa	capos are for making your chord a higher pitch.     there is lots of websites that teach chords, start with the basics.

It happens, so don't think you are in such a special  relationship, that he would never do that.  A rejected, or dumped, or vindictive person, does  a lot  of things they normally wouldn't do.

stIPi5rJaa	I agree that Bob Dylan and Bright Eyes have amazing lyrics.    If you write poetry, or even if you just write lyrics I'd say join poems-and-quotes.com because they are a great community that will give you feedback on where to improve your writing.  It might also come down to you having to read more inspirational work.  There are two author's off poems-and-quotes that I adore whom you might find some inspiration from:  http://www.poems-and-quotes.com/author.h...  and  http://www.poems-and-quotes.com/author.h...    But mostly, I guess it comes down to practice, practice, practice.  Seek out metaphors in every day life, use quotes that you hear on TV or in movies (or that people say) in your work, yeah it's stealing but they probably won't miss it.  Don't use "he. she.

You can write emotionally about something you haven't really experienced when you twist some of the things you say into either metaphors or if you've been touched by someones story.    Good luck.|`|vpoP8ksHaa	maybe you're thinking about the lyrics too much on their own? if you think of them as one with the tune, as a whole song instead of different parts put together, you might feel it more.    if you're not feeling inspired, go get inspired! ways i get inspiration are listening to really good songs, going out for a walk and just looking around, listening to people's conversations (not eavesdropping or anything haha, but just...getting stories and ideas), and maybe just thinking of all the little ideas you can and just jot them all down on paper in no particular order. and keep this piece of paper going for about a week or until its full of enough really good ideas and lines until you can build on them and put them together to form a song.    hope this helps.  good luck!|`|2gj0gY2Zaa	Honestly its pretty much just whether you're a good writer or not. However, i guess you could try just talking to someone else who you believe have had some really big life experiences and ask them to explain everything about it to you or just taking a small experience you've had and just blowing it way up : ) but still, lyrics can still be powerful even if they're not about the big stuff. just think about some kind of problem or small event you've had to face or be a part of whether it be big or small and try to write it in a way that you think will relate to people who may have had or still have, that same problem, or have been in that situation.    i dont actually know if any of that made sense : )  sorry if it didnt|`|fDCY1iX7aa	Try Cryptic crossword clues. It works for Radiohead|`|6ZMebqRaaa	HI!    I am a musician too and I am in the music business for about 12 years now. I suggest when you experience something to write it down. It does not have to be a rhyme or a verse, just a simple sentence or a paragraph. When you will read what you wrote down it will give you ideas for lyrics. If you did not have any life experiences, you can write about other people`s life experieces (your friends, your family, relatives, girlfriend...).  if that does not work for you, there is allways fiction. You can make up a story, or you can use books that you like for inspiration. Anything that comes to your mind. You can also write about political or historical situations, if you like those kinds of topics. You can write about the enviroment. There is a lot of material where you can exspress your emotions. I know that sometimes it`s hard to write something when you have no inspiration, just remember never to force yourself to write lyrics. First find the material you want to write about. It`s important to really think about the things you want to write about, and you will see it`s gonna be much easyer and natural to write lyrics.    I hope I have been helpful.    Warmly   Andrej

AA11863637	Darth Vader is the most powerful jedi/sith ever. In episode 1, obi-wan saw his midi-chlorian count to be off the charts and surpass even master yoda. this means that at his most powerful state, no being in the galaxy could match his power. In episode 2, he gets his *** kicked by dooku because he wasn't fully trained yet. In episode 3, he kills dooku, a bunch of jedi in the jedi temple. He lost to Obi-Wan ony cause he was so angry he wasn't thinking straight and therefore attacked like a maniac and didn't even think twice when he jumped and got his legs chopped off. In episodes 4-6 he was alot slower cause of his burns and the suit, but far more powerful both physically and in the force. Despite this, he still hadn't reached his full power yet cause if he did, he'd be able to shoot lighting like palpatine and shoot it back at people like yoda. If he had reached his full power, nothing could've stopped him.|`|7ea2e464166dbc327fc1ce8cefda6eb5aa	the force is not strong within you...if you must ask.|`|AA11118957	cause he can kick ur ***|`|e6538fc63373c6a54143539c67928b69aa	I think you're confusing story with inadequate acting. Darth Vader's ability to wield the power of the force is unmatched with any Jedi in history, but his want for power never allowed him to become fully trained. Add that to the fact that Hayden Christenson was not most convincing actor, and you could come to the conclusion that he wasn't really all that great. It is mentioned many time in the first (newer) trilogy that Master Windu is the most powerful (a fact well illustrated in the Clone Wars cartoon series), and that Master Yoda was the best fighter (again well illustrated, this time in Episode II versus Count Dooku). I believe Master Kenobi was considered the most wise and of all the Jedi his character seemed most to follow the Jedi Order (fearless, uncompromising in duty, etc.) . I would have to assume that one's force ability was controlled by the miticlorian blood-count, Lord Vader became less powerful after losing all his limbs (less blood and all that). However, at the time of the second (earlier) trilogy, he's pretty much the only Jedi left so he was kinda automatically the most powerful. Supposedly Luke could have become more powerful than the Emporer, and we all know what a wuss he was compared to the older corps of Jedi.|`|AA11844812	Okay first off - when the 1st 3 are going on - Anakin is learning to be a jedi - then he gains the strength, but not enough to defeat his teacher - you have to learn beyond your teacher to defeat them.  As he grew older, he gained more power and the more power he gained, the harder he was to defeat. ie. fighting Obi Wan (who in the end gave up to give Luke a reason to go after his own father).  Just because he couldn't kill his son, didn't mean he wasn't strong it was because he was defeating the evil inside of him at the same time.
000db28fb52ab31dee59ac037328db75aa	Laut Ralf Htter waren sie nach dem 86er Album "Electric Cafe" haupts?chlich damit besch?ftigt den gesamten Backkatalog zu digitalisieren und das Kling Klang Studio auf den neuesten technischen Stand zu bringen. Daraus resultierte 1991 auch das "The Mix" Album, eine Art Best Of mit den bekanntesten Stcken unterlegt mit neuen zeitgem??eren Beats.  91 gab es dann auch eine ausgedehnte Europatournee ehe man sich wieder in die Abgeschiedenheit des Dsseldorfer Studios zurckzog.  1999 erschien erstmals "Tour de France" auf CD, der alte Hit von 1983, den es zuvor auf keiner CD gab.   Im selben Jahr ver?ffentlichten sie dann "Expo 2000" fr die gleichnamige Weltausstellung in Hannover, das erste "echte" Lebenszeichen nach dreizehn Jahren ohne wirklich neues Material.  Es gab auch immer wieder mal Konzerte der Dsseldorfer Elektronikpioniere und im Jahr 2003 erschien tats?chlich das von Kraftwerkfans so lang ersehnte Album "Tour De France Soundtracks", das erste wirklich neue Album nach siebzehn Jahren. Die anschlie?ende Welttournee war ein riesiger Erfolg und wurde mit  der Live-CD "Minimum Maximum" eindrucksvoll dokumentiert.

I will even go out and take a walk in it! It seems so peaceful and cleansing. Like washing away all your worries. Plus a gentle rain stirs up all sorts of nature scents that can be quite pleasing. I love falling asleep to this kind of rain in the summer. Especially with the window wide open!  Thunder and lightning is not as calming and makes me apprehensive about how bad the storm might get. It keeps me awake wondering how many branches I'll have to pick up or if a tree limb will damage my home or car which has happened before.|`|66e0cb037e6b2625b33f60101730ab6eaa	I love the lightning.  I think it is beautiful, cool and very mysterious.  The thunder does not scare me, but it can sneak up on you, startle you if you didn't/don't see the lightning.  The only reason I don't like the thunder is because it scares my baby boy and he starts crying.|`|c74b9f9979314c39121d8e72bbc1b29caa	What do you mean "looks like" is it rain or is it not rain?

Muchas veces las ovas son finales alternativos a la serie como en evangelion o simplemente las ovas se presentan como aventuras extras para hacernos reir como las ovas de ranma.    Las peliculas hentai son las peliculas ke contienen sexo expicito, muchas veces las hentai tienen sus propios tramas y sus propios personajes y son una serie hentai en su totalidad ahora no recuerdo ejemplos, tambien existen hentai ke usan los personajes de series famosas.    Tambien existen lso fanfiction ke son historias escritas por los fans tomando como base los personajes de cierta serie, estas historias son de ultrafreaks como io asi ke no kreo ke nunka hayas leido uno y menos visto uno, esw como las ovas solo ke escrito por los fans ;).

Hentai, son los q tienen contenidos pornos.  manga, son los comics.|`|77572a80bd52c9ac41f018aff97424c1aa	En general todos los dibujos animados de origen japones se les llama "Anime" que es una abreviatura de la palabra inglesa "Animation" o "Animacin".    Anime = Animacin y en japn esa palabra es valida tanto para las caricaturas japonesas como para las que no lo son, pero en este lado del mundo utilizamos la palabra Anime para referirnos unicamente a la animacion japonesa (para identificarla).    La nimacion puede venir en diversos formatos, tenemos las peliculas, los ovas, los especiales, los omakes y las series.    Las peliculas son aquellas que tienen una duracin aproximada de 90 minutos. Se estrenan en los cines, dvd o en la tv. Solo cuentan con un episodio y normalmente narran una historia con un principio y final dentro de la misma cinta.    Los Ovas son una serie de capitulos que duran normalmente alrededor de 30 minutos, su duracin no es estandarizada para transmitirse en tv por lo que normalmente se estrenan en dvd. Normalmente son pocos, siguen una secuensia y pueden llegar a publicarse con grandes espacios de tiempo entre cada uno. Aca en america muchas televisoras acostumbran unir varios ovas y presentarlos como una solo pelicula, sobre todo en series populares como digimon donde unieron varios ovas para presentarlos como la pelicula.    Los especiales solo constan de un episodio y narran una historia independiente a la de la trama original de la serie, normalmente tienen temas como San Valentine, Navidad o A?o Nuevo, y se pueden usar para mostrar a los personajes en situaciones distintas a las acostumbradas. Normalmente se entrenan en TV o en dvd junto con la recopilcion de peliculas y episodios originales de la serie.    Los Omakes son peque?os videos, su duracion varia de 1 a 5 minutos,  en realidad su duracin se asemeja a las caricaturas de Bugs Bunny y compa?ia, y narran peque?as aventuras como entregar un paquete, hacer el desayuno, etc. Normalmente se estrenan junto con la serie o pelicula y se transmiten al final o al inicio de estas.    Finalmente tenemos las series, estas constan de varios episodios con una cierta secuencia entre ellos, su duracion normal es de 20 minutos por episodio (sin tomar en cuenta la cancion de inicio y fin) y este formato los hace aptos para su transmision en TV, su duracin depende de su exito y de los planes del productor, normalmente su tama?o minimo es de una temporada, las temporadas pueden variar su duracin que puede ser desde 11 episodios hasta alrededor de 26 episodios por temporada. Lo mas comun para series nuevas o de relativo exito son temporadas peque?as de alrededor de 12 episodios, si su exito continua se a?aden nuevas temporadas del mismo tama?o alcanzando hasta los 60 episodios. Para las series mas populares lo normal son temporadas de 26 episodios que si el exito continua pueden llegar a acumular cientos de episodios reuniendo varias temporadas. En todos los casos la transmisin de los episodios se hace via TV publicando uno o dos episodios a la semana.|`|980cd5311ee6b26d510e18f11086c026aa	a las peliculas de dibujos animados japonesas se les llama manga anime|`|8e71b491163cfe40e86097c00c515968aa	Anime|`|c8e420363fac4cdec528894071cbf112aa	Anime creo que hace referencia a las series animadas basadas en los Manga, que es como se conoce popularmente al comic japons. Ovas son aquellas en formato pelicula de esas mismas series. Es decir, cuando las series se forman de capitulos de 40 minutos ms o menos, las Ovas duran como un peque?o largometraje de una hora ms o menos y suele ser autoconcluyente, es decir con argumento propio. De hecho muchisimas series animadas japonesas se componen de capitulos y Ovas que completan el universo de la serie.

43267a8ca0970de6d02aaaa047f04c51aa	I personally don't like rap very much, but it does take talent. You may think it sucks, but I am glad there are different types of music out there for all the different kind of people there are in the world. To answer your question, people listen to rap for the same reason you listen to rock, because they like it, they can relate to it, or it makes them feel good.|`|AA11711555	I agree with you. But, why do the Mothers Against Hard Rock single out rock music????? Rap is waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy worse. That pisses me off. Rock relaxes me.|`|645b6bce5d196ab4ba8288b7c1313c29aa	because it the best music out there and it connects with people|`|102685319f9c53843a199ee9d94441eaaa	I dont understand why people say that. Rap takes more skill than jumping up and down and screaming. They dont just rap about money cars and cloths. Its about there life and what they have been through there pain people can connect to them because theyve been through it too and they can relate.|`|6c78d18a01dadc1930b5285969d9a867aa	Listen to yourself. You obviously aint' no musician, people can listen to whatever they want. Different people have different taste and likings an am positive theres people who will find the music you like absolutly garbage! One more thing to say...... JAY Z an LINKIN PARK.... that works, doesn't it?!?|`|2088750e2e24db94af84bd0688460755aa	Like others here have already said, people listen to rap for the same reasons people listen to rock, jazz, country, etc.  Either A) they like it, B) they can relate to it, C) it makes them feel good, or D) all of the above.    I do understand why people come up with that kind of conclusion about rap; that's all you see on TV and hear on the radio.  But for the most part your opinion, like most everyone else's that claims they hate rap, is very one-sided.  Like I've said many times before, not all rap is like what you see on TV or hear on mainstream radio stations.  If you were willing to dig a little deeper into the genre, you'd discover that not all rap emphasizes materialism, misogyny and is filled with profanity.  As a matter of fact, there are a lot of hip hop artists out there who don't fit the "cookie cutter rapper" mold.  For example:    - Little Brother  - Mos Def  - Talib Kweli  - Common  - De La Soul  - Dead Prez  - The Roots  - Madlib (and his alter-ego, Quasimoto)  - Five Deez  - Ugly Duckling  - Slum Village...(and plenty more)    Unfortunately, you'll rarely find any of them in the mainstream media.  That's what the real problem is.|`|AA11877233	WHY DO YOU LISTEN TO ROCK PPL CAN LISTEN TO WHAT THEY WANNA|`|c165180d4ccb8862019d51260929ff85aa	Its the best f**kin music if you listened to it maybe you would kno that they have some point in it not all of them are about money, sex and drugs|`|9f10c56058c009be8a51136ceaf24935aa	You are a closed-minded individual, my friend.  Listen to Gorillaz.  Listen to Quasimoto.  Listen to the Wu Tang Clan.  Don't just go by assumptions that you've picked up from the average rap video on MTV, because yeah, that stuff (along with everything else they play on MTV) does suck.  Emo is the crappiest music I've ever heard.  It's just annoying pale people with no lives and no talent whining about their ninth grade girlfriends.|`|AA11867612	the answer is another question: why do monkey's eat green banana's?  answer: they don't know any better.|`|AA12339366	Today's rap is awful for the most part and you describe it well.  I am so over all that bling bling sh..t, it's lame and overrated.    However, when rap came to be in the early 90s it was more about people's life experiences, life in the hood/projects, gangs, hos, guns, drugs etc (Easy E, Dr. Dre, Tupac, NWA etc).  I think that's why people got into it because it was average guys "singing "about a not so privileged life.|`|AA11564872	i agree with you all the way rocker. i think that most rap fanatics are less intelligent

Gosto do tema que eles tratam mais acho que essa histria est mito repetitiva aquela coisa de um casal se junta e  separado por vil?es a eles se juntam no final... nossa isso t muito tosko! Eles deveriam mudar a histria um pouco! Eu gostei muito quando eles come?aram a falar de homossexualismo acho que seria muito bom pois eles poderiam mostrar que as pessoas n?o devem ser preconceituosas s que esse eles ?o deram continuidade com isso, a guria sofreu preconceito e depois saiu da novela... isso foi uma coisa que n?o agradou... poderia ter continuidade e seria algo bom.

O que mais me irrita  ver como muita gente fica emocionada e pensando em como o gugu  bom ao achar uma pessoa na misseria na rua e contar uma historia triste durante todo o programa e no final dar carro, casa, presentes, etc. ser que ninguem percebe que  isso que eles usam para atrair ibope? porque n?o dar esse dinheiro para creches ou institui??es carentes? Uma pessoa que ele ajude assim com casa, presentes, brinquedos, computadores, cursos, etc n?o se compara com dar alimento a varios que necesitam.  Como disse no come?o. esta  minha opiniao.

One thing I have a really hard time is is that in A New Hope, he tortures his own daughter. That is really messed up.

He is a genuine shade of grey in that he doesn't easily fall into either being good or evil. He did some very vile things in his lifetime but he also had an unflinching love for his wife and children.

Primeiro... acho q o diretor n?o deveria ter se apegado tanto ao filme antigo, com Christopher Reeves... no incio do filme parece q estamos nos anos 80!!!    Segundo, deveriam ter chamado o Tom Welling, do Smallville, pra fazer o papel. Ficaria mto mais caracterizado para os f?s q acompanham a srie. Sobre o Tom Welling ser mto novo, n?o tem nada a ver, eles tm quase a mesma idade, tanto q o Brandon Routh tb fez teste pra Smallville, mas n?o passou.

(I need to know, sometimes I don't have Faith in myself but my family does)  What I think is that you hold a lot of Emotions, a lot of feelings that need to get out. You get frustrated because you try to do something and it doesn't work out for you they way you want it to. Whether it being with family, friends, love relationship, or a project you started. You hold things in and you tend to take it off on the wrong person or the wrong time. As far as your business...it will pick-up slowly, don't get upset or frustrated if it doesn't work they way you want it to.

AA10252620	Chelo is one of the pioneer Texas-born Mexican-American recording artists responsible for the popularization of Mexican music in the United States. She achieved the status of an internationally acclaimed performer, whose work was known and loved throughout the Spanish-speaking world. Many of the boleros that Chelo Silva performed and included in her repertoire also reflected a certain nontraditional, almost rebellious image, generally not adopted by female singers. Her songs spoke of love affairs gone awry, betrayals, and desires that could not be subdued.    "Cha Cha" is the featured song and performance in the. Mis Universe swimsuit competition.

ed97a348f9476c44e1896fba82dbee4aaa	If you have a passion for it, you can work in film or theater, but be willing to take smaller parts and invest the time to hone your craft. Join your community theater. Take drama, literature and psychology classes. Practice improv. Learn jobs behind the camera and jobs behind the curtain. Read prolifically, especially the great dramatists such as Shakespeare,  Moliere, and contemporary ones like Albee and Williams.    Yeah, you probably have to go to Hollywood, New York, or the West End for fame and fortune, but the competition is fierce and the process can be brutalizing and humiliating. You'll need flexibility and thick skin. Think about auditioning for commercials. Investigate the equity theater option. You won't get paid, but if you're lucky the showcasing will get you seen.    Break a leg!|`|AA12260297	i want to be an actress and u really have to go 2 hollywood to get a big part!!

AA11614272	he wont cheat on her just to get some sex because her knows how much it would hurt her if he did that|`|1a5f110e8bf941639ca365fb6ea96df1aa	Some have found the lyrics of the song cryptic and claim that the singer never identifies what the "that" is that he is unwilling to do.  Although some people assume that "that" is an exophoric reference to a sex act, it is actually an anaphoric reference to the varying activities specified as antecedents in the lyric that the singer says that he won't do.    "I'll never forget the way you feel right now ..."   "I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way tonight ..."   "I'll never do it better than I do it with you ..."   "I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life ..."   In addition, the female vocalist identifies two other things that the lead singer denies that he will do: "You'll see that it's time to move on" and "You'll be screwing around." To both of these, the lead singer emphatically responds, "I won't do that! No, I won't do that!"    The phrase does appear as an exophoric reference in a song on the Steinman-produced album Faster Than the Speed of Night, where it is a piece of overheard conversation in a bar.|`|2234ca10f511649f7f031dafc8bb8664aa	He wouldn't share his Dr. Pepper.|`|1e84502373e700e925843b4a5c69837daa	He loves that person but not to the extent of loving forever, the whole song put together makes more sence. The woman in the song Do you love me, will you love forever do you need me, will you never leave me, will you make me so happy for the rest of your life, will you take me away will you make me your wife? So that makes more sence, right?|`|a16a22ace8245b49cbf622eeb05efad4aa	idk, but thats a badd-*** dr. pepper commercial....haha|`|65a788d6de6c70f87384c3f8999463e8aa	he won't cheat her.|`|e41c7ea732c4106f0534d71b0abf910faa	He won't tell her what the darn song's about.

Its a real p1sstake though when it was one i auditioned for and then see one of mates in it. Thats life though i guess. I do enjoy wathcing commercials especially the good ones and there are a lot of really good ones out there these days.

I AM kinda sick of hear Green Day, but I'll always love them and listen to them. "Move Along" was better than "Scars". I didn't like "Hustlin'", I LOVE "Ridin'"!!

d5cf554d5949b7efa05f3c6d5e95dfa4aa	i think he felt like he had no other way out. he was gona die no matter what because the ship was going down and that sea man thing was after him. so instead of going down queitly he went down with a fight. just my opinion tho. i have no idea if hes alive. i guess that part threes plot.|`|47b2b3727be5852c2390279734aea771aa	It was a little shop moment!    In this last scene with Jack Sparrow, he unlocks himself but is met with the Kracken..the monster that Davey Jones unleashes..and the monster belches into his face with the smell of "a thousand rotting corpses" and hits jack in the face with his hat and mucus apparently.. Jack just mutters under his breath.."eh. not that bad." Takes his sword.. and jumps into the beast. The reason they do it is to make it seem more questionable whether or not he got out of there alive... i suppose if he does live..he jumped into the heart of the beast and cut him apart from the inside because you obviously cannout get through the Kraken from the outside.   Or if he dies...the monster ate him. yes.      oh ...and elizabeth said that "they were after him and his ship, not them." They is in refrence to Davey Jones and his crew... and she said this as she was locking him to the pole.      (i hope someone out there gets the refrence to the musical Little Shop of Horrors)|`|AA11337663	i would love to help u,but i saw it a month ago and dont remember.lets wait for the dvd in a few months and find out again.  pirates of the caribbean:at worlds end coming may 2007.|`|86e513a31ff4a8cf23d7a16b8688cecaaa	The big octupus was following Jack Sparrow, so Elizabeth sacrificed him for the rest of them.

In this scene, Elizabeth says, "You came back. I always knew you were a good man." Then she kisses him to distract him while she chains him to the mast. She then explains, "It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry." What this means is that Davy Jones has commanded the Kraken to kill Jack, and it goes after Jack and anything he's basically in contact with. So, Elizabeth traps Jack on the Black Pearl so that the Kraken will take him, and this allows the rest of the group to escape.     By the time Jack freed himself from the shackles, he had nowhere to escape from the Kraken, and at the same time, it's sort of implied that he *is* a good man and goes down with his ship, sacrificing it and himself for the others. You'll find out what happens to him in the third movie which should come out May/June 2007. But he doesn't really die-- he may come close to it by landing in Purgatory, but he gets rescued by everyone (as indicated at the end of Dead Man's Chest).|`|7621828d5414f7036fedb6da614faaddaa	she said its after you not us and tells the others he sacrificed himself to save the others so when he gets loose its right behind him and he figures he would go down with the ship also he is found in purgatory with the pearl in the third movie|`|4d75bc271eec4d9717efc5e1e65a9b6faa	jack does live because he (johnny depp) is going to be in the next one. i dont know if you heard correctly but at the ending of the movie (2nd) the scary/weird lady said that they can find jack at the end of the world (rumored title of 3rd) and thats when barbosa shows up because she said that they would need a very powerful captian (something along those lines).    I think jack's compass made elizabeth (lets call her liz) confused. jack told liz that the compass shows what they really want. but it doesnt really make sence (i saw this movie the day it came out so i dont remember a lot of details). liz locked jack up dont forget that so she might have done it because she was still in love with will but wants to get away from all the troubles because if jack comes along the trouble will follow.    it really just depends on how the writers want to end. its either jack-liz or liz-will. i think and hope its liz-will because if it wasnt for the first one being such a big hit the series wouldnt have continued. plus its a disney movie.  So really there arent any answers to those loose strings that the 2nd one made yet.|`|AA11311552	He jumped in because he's brave!

Algunas drogas como la marihuana la coca hacen parte de la cultura de la humanidad que ha venido consumindolas desde hace ms de 7.000 a?os. Las drogas son patrimonio de la humanidad, pero por razones econmicas ahora estn prohibidas. No es cierto que las razones de su prohibicin sea para proteger la salud de las personas, poque si fuera as ya habran prohibido el consumo de alcohol y de tabaco, adems restringiran la venta de pegantes y solventes que tambin los usan con fines de modificar el sistema nervioso central.|`|0567d4d0cf467767d04ea896b5a2fa6eaa	totalmente en contra de cualquier tipo de drogas la vida es para vivirla pero sin recurrir a ninguna sustancia.por mi fuera,tabaco,alcohol,hachisy sobre todo las mas duras como la cocaina.|`|6c1a71383085411c10f4357aa9ba7645aa	100% en contra porque mucha gente las consume en exceso aunque tienes razon q el alcohol es una droga y cada vez mata a mas gente.|`|3d42b44103a7ed69c63b8067746fe4d0aa	Ahh !! ?que no son legales?.. el alcohol y las pastillas tambien son drogas en cuanto a la marihuana pues la encuentras en cada esquina, la verdad es que si las legalizaran y prohibieran las realmente peligrosas seria mejor..|`|9fc89eb8eb3eff062101e5ed8578a84aaa	totalmente a favor.|`|e8f6a3d224ffda0425bec815c48404c5aa	En contra , ROTUNDAMENTE|`|530207643b8eaa8a10cbbd58ad65a2f5aa	en contra|`|ae30f956a037c8971f3a09940c13c869aa	el tabaco y el alcohol no son drogas psicotrpicas como lo son la marihuana y sus derivados ( que pueden ser ms peligrosas)     pero que se lagalicen, por encima de todo est la libertad de hacer cada cual lo que quiera con su cuerpo.|`|8b7278ba3a82640e89985d6db607f6dfaa	Totalmente en contra.

Pero el que est metido en la droga, por lo menos no tendra que ir atracando a los dems, para conseguirla. Respecto al alcohol y el tabaco, creo que todo con la debida moderacin, no s tan malo, y si te acostumbras a consumirlo moderadamente, no me parece tan malo, siempre y cundo este tabaco y alcohol est bien regulado por las autoridades sanitarias y el alcohol no sea de garrafa, y el tabaco con unos niveles txicos, bien controlados para la salud.|`|720607ad2431ae21bfdf2db18c1c3fbeaa	no se, no se, no tengo ganas de pensar.|`|4acc3f6f2886a031d58f263bcbfbe505aa	Estoy absolutamente en contra, todo lo que pueda atentar contra la salud debera estar prohibido ya que la gente no somos lo suficientemente inteligente/consciente para prevenir el alcance de determinadas experiencias.

Thank you for bringing this subject up..|`|d4bd267533805f1f17be779e1dabcc35aa	Well I also believe in making the world safe for our children, but children grow up to be adults. So eventually the children u helped make the world safe for will be adults. An adult can make a choice to have sex and reproduce. A child should not be having sex.  So I believe in making the world  safe for our children so when my children grow up and have children the world will hopefully be safe for them as well.

Fez teatro amador e foi uma das criadoras do Grupo Asdrbal Trouxe o Trombone, que levou para o palco o comportamento dos jovens de sua gera??o. Chegou  Rede Globo trabalhando em programas de humor e depois em novelas. Aos poucos, Regina foi conquistando seu espa?o como atriz, humorista e apresentadora. Com TV Pirata, no final da dcada de 1980, ajudou a lan?ar as sementes para outro tipo de humor. Regina dividiu a cria??o do Programa Legal, que estreou em abril de 1991, com Lus Fernando Guimar?es, antigo companheiro do Asdrbal. As primeiras influncias sobre sua linguagem comunicadora vieram de seu pai, Geraldo Cas, que foi diretor geral e idealizador do Stio do Picapau Amarelo, da Globo, marco na histria da TV brasileira.     Regina admite que os hbitos de seu pai, "que parecia o prdio inteiro da Globo trabalhando", participando de todas as etapas do programa, foram uma heran?a profissional que ela cultivou.     Tambm a marcaram o pioneirismo e a ousadia de seu av?, Ademar Cas. Vindo de pau-de-arara de Caruaru, conseguiu se tornar um nome conhecidssimo no Rio de Janeiro, gra?as a seu trabalho no rdio. Durante os anos 1930 e 1940, colocava no ar, na extinta Rdio Mairink Veiga, programas que chegavam a durar 12 horas. Regina diz que outro tra?o importante de seu carter, o otimismo, pode ter sido herdado de seu av?. "Saiu de pau-de-arara, acabou morando em Copacabana, e continuava fazendo a sua carne de sol na janela de seu apartamento", conta a atriz. Aos 15 anos, Regina tornou-se independente de sua famlia, n?o por op??o, mas por necessidades prticas. Seus pais se separaram quando Regina tinha 10 anos. O pai foi para S?o Paulo. Alguns anos depois, sua m?e, Heleida, casou-se novamente e foi morar na Europa com o novo marido e as duas outras filhas. Regina decidiu ficar no Brasil e foi morar com amigas. Finalmente, se mudaria para a casa de uma tia, Julinha, de quase 80 anos.     Regina Cas  m?e de Benedita. "Eu coloquei nome de negra nela e isso  t?o verdade que, quando ela nasceu, as pessoas me perguntavam como estava a Sebastiana, confundindo com outro nome tpico", conta ela. Inaugurou um novo estilo de documentrios, um reality show com a marca Cas, que trata com respeito a gente e o cotidiano fragmentado da cultura brasileira. Um jornalismo mesclado com irreverncia e tra?os antropolgicos. " difcil afirmar que transformei o jeito que o brasileiro se v, mas  a sensa??o que tenho. Uma vez, estive no interior de S?o Paulo, numa cidadezinha, quase um quilombo, onde todos s?o ****** e pobres e tm um baile tpico, que  muito genuno e diferente. Mas eles tinham vergonha de n?o pertencer ao maior, ao funk. Nossa presen?a foi para eles quase como um aval de que o que fazem tambm tem valor. E geralmente temos esta impress?o", afirma a atriz.|`|966c4cf25a32ec67c4da07edeb5d53c6aa	eu acho legal  a maneira do programa dela, e almdisso ela faz um estilo de programa que ningum faz, que  mostrar a periferia, o sert?o nordestino de outra forma... lugares que ningum vai.....|`|e6dd1e09b20afaab3e53ffcb48399319aa	Muito sem classe, escrachada mesmo.

Voc ainda pode encontrar nas bancas at o final deste ms (agosto de 2006).    Na antepenltima pgina, em uma conversa com o Capit?o Marvel, SUPERMAN diz: "...por muitas raz?es, acho que, se me vestisse NORMALMENTE, eu seria no mnimo desencorajador e, para alguns ASSUSTADOR."    Ele justifica seu modo ridculo de se vestir (inclusive a cueca pelo lado de fora das cal?as) por que se ele se vestisse de maneira natural, provavelmente, na historia em quadrinho, ele seria visto como uma aberra??o.    Ele completa dizendo: "O traje cria um DISTANCIAMENTO ..."    Talves isso que torne as histrias do SUPERMAN interessantes e duradouras, ele tem super poderes mas tem sentimentos humanos: como medo de ser rejeitado.

Six flags was closed down and demolished already, so that's not an option.    Additionally, I hate to say it, but there is not much to do in Houston.  There are restaurants, there are stores to shop in, and there's business.  Everything else is typical suburbia.

Apologia barata de uma sociedade moderna desvinculada com aquilo que presta. No Brasil n?o mais se produzem msicas ( salvo raras e rarssimas exce??es) produzem lixi, lixo, lixo. Cara de uma sociedade que n?o sabe o significado da palavra MSICA.

Tudo era imposi??o. Seria como hoje fazer tatuagens, usar piercings bem aparentes no rosto e procurar emprego no Palcio do Governo, de preferncia no Gabinete. S?o 180o entre um lado e outro. S?o os extremos opostos. N?o entro aqui no mrito da quest?o, s estou dando um exemplo atual, sem comprometimento do bem ou do mal.  O que denota isso?  Que os precursores s?o pessoas que est?o contra as conven??es do sistema capitalista; est?o fazendo ou querendo fazer uma crtica social. Exteriorizar uma rea??o contrria.O pai e a m?e n?o fizeram isso, ou  eram contra ou poderiam at ter tido vontade, mas n?o tiveram coragem ou n?o puderam se expor para "manter-se". H tambm os que fazem isso, sem saber porque, s por modismo, mas isso j  outra histria.  No tempo do Roberto houve o movimento "hippie", que teve  origem nos Estados Unidos, na segunda metade dos anos 60, caracterizando-se pela sua oposi??o radical  militariza??o da sociedade e  Guerra do Vietn? (que comoveu o mundo todo) e seu slogan "Make Love Not War" (Fa?a amor e n?o a guerra) foi um dos mais caractersticos da poca. Passou para a Europa e difundiu-se pelo mundo, influenciando principalmente certos domnios culturais: msica, pintura, teatro.   A famosa pe?a "Hair", que quer dizer cabelo,  dessa poca. Todos os atores ficavam nus no palco, era um clamor  igualdade das pessoas. A msica da pe?a "How can people be so hard"  linda, s?o questionamentos que dizem  "Como as pessoas podem ser t?o duras/perversas, como podem ignorar seus amigos. T?o fcil ser duro, t?o fcil dizer um n?o..." e por a vai.  John Lennon, dos Beatles, fez uma mensagem de amor humano, vislumbrando o amanh? com "Imagine", que tambm  maravilhosa e fala de amor entre todas as pessoas do mundo,  a "ecologia" do ser humano.  No Brasil o movimento foi contra a n?o-violncia, pois a repress?o foi terrvel (Cad o cantor Geraldo Vandr? Sumiram com ele, por causa da crtica. A UNE tambm tem muitas histrias...e outras) e em oposi??o  sociedade industrial e aos valores tradicionais, preconizando a liberdade em todos os domnios, valorizava tambm a vida em comunidades . O lema aqui era "Paz e Amor".  Caetano fez "Sem len?o e Sem Documento". Chico Buarque fez aquela que, no momento n?o lembro o nome, que diz "mas o que eu quero  lhe dizer: que a coisa aqui est preta!"   O cabelo comprido dele  uma postura que continua sendo mantida. Marca os valores do movimento, a busca de um mundo melhor, mais igual...que n?o aconteceu. John foi assassinado, os rumos sociais n?o s?o satisfatrios, isso significa "Hair"...Apesar de tudo foi tambm naquela poca que Roberto viveu os melhores anos de sua vida, pois atenuava com suas can??es o momento t?o sofrido e ao mesmo tempo rebelou-se contra a deturpa??o da vida nas comunidades (hippies), por ter ocorrido promiscuidade da vida sexual.  O amor livre, que deveria ser o que disse John, para o coletivo, no sentido mais humano, passou a ser "tipo tribal", os que foram no "embalo", as drogas tambm rolaram, pois tudo tem dois lados e quem faz as coisas por modismo n?o tem convic??o e deturpa os valores, "pega o bonde andando e que ir na janelinha".  Roberto por seu lado quis salvaguardar a rela??o a dois, com sua msicas romanticas, talvez entendendo que por esse caminho  que chegaria  uma estrutura social melhor, que isso poderia dar um rumo a quem estivesse indo por um caminho de auto destrui??o. Acredito, que o dia que ele estiver contente com a evolu??o da espcie  capaz de cortar os cabelos!  A pessoa tem que estar bem consigo mesmo e com ele mesmo tenho certeza que est, pode at estar triste por ter passado pelo que passou (custou tanto para encontrar uma companheira ideal e a perdeu em pouco tempo) e ver seus amigos, Erasmo (suicdio da mulher dele) e Wanderlia (perdeu um filho pequeno afogado na piscina da sua casa) terem tambm sofrido t?o duros golpes na vida.  Maravilhoso o Roberto, que com seus cabelos longos reconheceu de imediato seu filho ao saber de sua existncia, enquanto outro "mundialmente" famoso destratou sua filha, n?o a reconheceu e mesmo depois de DNA, continuou desprezando-a e n?o quis conhece-la. O cabelo dele  bem curtinho, jamais teria um cabelo longo, tipo "black power"!  Quem critica o Roberto e seus cabelos s  capaz de ver o prprio umbigo, desconhece a histria da dcada de 60! Parou no Cabral? Vai conhecer Porto Seguro, que  linda, espairece, amplie seus horizontes e "se liga Man!"  Espero que tenha conseguido satisfazer a sua curiosidade. Achei a sua pergunta muito oportuna. Voc vai longe na vida,  uma pessoa em busca de "razes" e n?o se satisfaz com conhecimentos superficiais.

Cremes dentais listrados podem ser feitos incluindo dois cremes dentais de cores diferentes em uma embalagem especial. O tubo possui dois compartimentos, cada um com uma cor. Apertando o tubo, os dois cremes saem pela abertura; o compartimento externo produz as listras.  Para manter o custo da embalagem o mais baixo possvel, hoje  comum que os tubos sejam preenchidos com creme listrado.

O "Point" da Fenda do Bikini sem duvidas  o Siri-Cascudo, lanchonete do Seu Sirigueijo, onde Bob Esponja e Lula Molusco trabalham.

CURIOSIDADE:     O Presidente George W.

Para outras pessoas o beijo  o que menos compromete. Beijam muita gente, sem que isso signifique nada alm de prazer. A verdade  que beijar  uma das delcias da vida, e por isso mesmo vale a pena faz-lo bem. E voc, sabe beijar? Beija bem? O que  beijar bem?   Quem nunca beijou fica na expectativa de como ser. E s vai aprender beijando. N?o h outro jeito, n?o h curso, n?o h aula nem livro que ensine isso. Voc manifesta o desejo de beijar olhando ou aproximando-se da boca dela(e).

3f75c6902aa22951ec56bb13a45ded7caa	Ol Flavinha,    Tenho orkut e considero ele uma ferramenta interativa de enorme potencial de utilidade e valor.    Nele  possvel desenvolver uma apresenta??o de seu prprio perfil para uma comunidade global, referenciando sua forma de ser e de pensar, comportamento, gostos, interesses e expectativas.    Ele tambm permite a cria??o de foruns para troca de informa??es sobre assuntos de interesse comum, onde voc pode se inscrever e participar de quantos tiver interesse, sendo que alguns dependem da aprova??o de um moderador.    Como toda ferramenta interativa que envolve a participa??o de pessoas existe uma rela??o que precisa ser definida:    Qual o nvel de equilbrio admissvel entre QUALIDADE e BANALIDADE?    O orkut tem desistimulado seu uso a muitos usurios pelo fato de que ocorrerem abusos na dissemina??o de mensagens que insultam os outros, expalham virus, atrapalham seus foruns que recebem mensagens inteis ou provocativas insultando a todos, entre outros males, havendo dificuldade de separar o til do intil.    Nenhuma comunidade ser melhor do que a qualidade de participa??o de seus usurios.    A Qualidade referencia o compromisso em agregar valor, atendendo ao mesmo tempo interesses pessoais e os da comunidade de participantes.     Na vida,  muito mais rpido...    Destruir do que Construir,   Banalizar ao invs de agregar Valor,  Criticar ao invs de Ajudar,  Desrespeitar ao invs de Respeitar,  Pensar apenas em si mesmo, do que em Todos.    A Banalidade infelizmente, se multiplica muito mais rapidamente do que a Qualidade, pois n?o se compromete com nada nem com ningum.    Banalidade  um cancer que deteriora o respeito, a confian?a e a considera??o entre as pessoas.     Uma comunidade que n?o d aten??o  ela comete suicdio paulatinamente.    Sem uma Poltica que estimule e de sustenta??o a Qualidade numa comunidade, ela ser sempre Exce??o e n?o Regra.     N?o havendo uma poltica que controle o desequilbrio natural  entre a Qualidade e a Banalidade, esta ltima prevalecer, pois se multiplica muito mais rapidamente do que a outra, podendo tornar qualquer boa ferramenta desacreditada e desestimulante no decorrer do tempo, por melhor que ela seja em recursos.    Estamos correndo o mesmo risco aqui em nossa comunidade Yahoo Respostas, quem gosta de dar e receber o melhor, precisa lutar a favor da Qualidade.    Um grande abra?o !!!|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	eu tenho !  eu acho o orkut legal !  consigo conversar com parentes e amigos com mais  frequencia !|`|59004c973e8e8c9a98784884bff3b02daa	eu tenho  legal|`|b7cfadd44dd6aa9bc3b95fb84edd1473aa	eu tenho.......a pergunta  s isso......|`|d3db78d650189ddf5af253b4d208f4dfaa	Tenho...e hoje qm n?o tem?!

La pica se conoce comunmente como un deseo irresistible de comer o lamer elementos como tierra, tiza, yeso, virutas de la pintura, bicarbonato de sosa, almidn, pegamento, moho, cenizas de cigarrillo o cualquier otra cosa que no tiene, en apariencia, ningn valor alimenticio. El mdico gineclogo Hoover Canaval, profesor de ginecologa y obstetricia de la Facultad de Salud de la Universidad del Valle, considera que cuando las mujeres en el primer trimestre del embarazo sufren de pica se debe a un antojo especial que desencadena el organismo con el fn de obtener oligoelementos -zinc, manganeso, molibdeno, etc-. Tambin se puede asociar este trastorno a los retardos de desarrollo, las deficiencias mentales, antecedentes familiares del desorden o a disturbios psicolgicos originados en una infancia en un hogar muy pobre y con una carencia grande de afecto y amor.    El tratamiento para la pica depende de las causas que lo originaron. Si son deficiencia de oligoelementos se trata el problema con algunos suplementos vitamnicos o desaparece por si sola, si se trata de falta de amor u otras causas psicolgico-afectivas se necesita de terapia conductual-cognitiva.    Las complicaciones de la Pica pueden incluir desnutricin, problemas abdominales, obstruccin intestinal, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, envenenamiento por mercurio o fosforo y lesin dental.    Puede ser posible (pero infrecuente) para las personas con Anorexia y/o Bulimia desarrollar Pica.|`|f01517deae29f8b64a2a280e53af36b7aa	RECOMIENDOTE UNA CAMISA DE FUERZA,(broma)|`|15916c9a47057d37d03279d1890c3c8caa	quizas tengas un problema de hormonas..escucharas esto raro pero viene desde el embarazo, ha algunas mujeres embarazadas les da gana hasta de comer jabon (como mi abuela me cuenta que le pasaba) mi prima esta embarazada y come tierra y pienso que si una mujer embarazada tiene las hormonas mas alborotadas que una normal como tu, por eso pienso que es hormonal.|`|33e2cc11592f7d1e62cf157f33ca325eaa	Debes visitar un "psiclogo."Urgente.|`|51e00f5d67bb0a17ee3a50100feef65baa	tenes un tic oral, nervios o tas como una cabra.|`|a500f0e6ee98bade1c442e913e608c25aa	Por que estas enfermo quizas... ve a ver a un psicologo|`|8fc1089253d935288f63a3c342d2c43caa	estas loco ve a un doctor cuando empieces a comer mierda|`|AA10014472	Muy probablemente se debe a falta de alguna sustancia bsica en tu organismo.

AA10610800	Here's a little about her until you figure it out lol:     Paula Julie Abdul was born on June 19, 1962 in San Fernando, California to Harry and Lorraine Abdul. Her parents seperated in 1969. In 1981 Paula enrolled in Cal State Northridge. It was during this time she began a fifteen year struggle with bulemia.  In 1987 Paula wisely uses over $30,000 in savings to record a demo tape. In 1988 "Knocked Out" reached 48 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Paula's debut album Forever Your Girl is released on June 21, just two days after Paula's birthday. "The Way That You Love Me" is released in November of 1988. Paula continues her fight with bulimia and joins Over Eaters Anonymous.  Paula has her first number one single when "Straight Up" tops the charts in February of 1989. "Forever Your Girl" becomes Paula's second  1 single in May. In September "Cold Hearted" gives Paula her third  1 hit in only 8 months. In October of 1989 Forever Your Girl reaches the number one spot on Billboard's album charts, and spends over a year in the top 10. "The Way That You Love Me" peaks at number 3 in December of 1989.  In February of 1990 "Opposites Attract" becomes Paula's 4th number one single. Paula Abdul is the first woman to have 4 number one singles from her debut album. In Spring of 1990 Paula breaks the 28-year-old record held by Connie Francis when she spends her 68th consecutive week in the US Top 40. Paula also choreographed the Academy Awards in 1990. She has also done choreography for Janet Jackson, ZZ Top, Debbie Gibson, and many more artists. Shut Up and Dance, a collection of remixes is also released on May 8, 1990.  In 1991 Paula wins the award for "Best Music Video- Short Form" for "Opposites Attract".  In May of 1991, "Rush Rush", the first single from her second album Spellbound, is released. Less than one month later on June 8th, Spellbound hits  1 on Billboard's album charts and stays on top for two weeks. Just a week and a half after that, "Rush Rush" takes over the  1 position on the Billboard Hot 100. "Rush Rush" becomes the longest running single since Madonna's "Like a Virgin" by staying at number one for 5 weeks. "The Promise of a New Day", the second single from Spellbound also hits  1 in September of 1991. In November, "Blowing Kisses in the Wind" peaks at number 6 on the Hot 100.  "Vibeology" only reached number 16, where it stayed for 3 weeks, in February of 1992. The next month Paula gets engaged to Emilio Estevez and marries him in April. She would divorce him only two years later in May of 1994. Also in April 1992, the 5th single from Spellbound, "Will You Marry Me?" is released.  In August of 1993, Forever Your Girl backup vocalist Yvette Marine loses her lawsuit in which she claimed to have actually sung lead vocals on several tracks of the album.   In May of 1995, "My Love Is For Real" enters the Hot 100 at number 36. Head Over Heels is released on June 13,1995. Unfortunately, it would only reach  18 on Billboard's Album charts. Two more singles were released from Head Over Heels, "Crazy Cool" and "Ain't Never Gonna Give You Up", neither of them do well on the charts though.    On October 25, 1996 Paula gets married to Brad Beckerman. The wedding is included in Lifetime's Celebrity Weddings special, and also in In Style magazine. Paula met Brad on a blind date set up by friends in February of 1996.  January 12, 1997 marks Paula's dramatic acting debut when the ABC Sunday Night Movie "Touched By Evil" airs. Paula has also made appearances on CBS's "Cybill" and NBC's "The Single Guy".|`|54a8ad1f00ec6f2fdbdbc5a97f50ff84aa	for get all yall paula haters i love paula and she's the best and everything about her is not online so hahaha|`|d756ca08f4158bd3b0c26686f838769caa	shut up your just jealous that shes hot and famous .. and your not.    but um for the book? i have no idea i heard september 5th; i also heard this tuesday? idk. try calling a local bookstore; they should know something.|`|AA12149254	i pretty sure i know what it's gonna say    sample: Pretend to be judge on a future hit reality show to screw hot contestants and still kick them out of the competition.|`|7d90a3b4a28f2a07552e871d30e8ed53aa	Why would you want that?

La poca creo que era en los '40  '50. La cuestin que el padre no va a poder hacerse cargo de su prole y ella sale a buscar familia adoptante para cada uno de sus hijos. Creo que haba uno que era autista o con problemas mentales entonces ella decide que el que quiera llevarse al ms lindo y simptico de sus hijos deber cargar tambin con su hermanito con dificultades. Y ah empieza el drama, el normal pierde oportunidades por su hermanito. A la nena ms grande la devuelven porque la queran de sierva.

La pelota golpe a uno de los hombres, quien de inmediato junt ambas manos en su entrepierna, y cay al suelo rodando y gimiendo lastimosamente.     Las mujeres corrieron hasta donde estaba el hombre. Una de ellas, sintindose culpable, dijo: "Por favor, djeme ayudarlo. Soy quiropractica y s como quitarle el dolor si usted me lo permite."    "Ouch, auuuu, noooo. Estar bien... el dolor se me pasara en unos minutos", contest el hombre, mientras permaneca en posicion fetal, tirado en el cesped y con las manos en su entrepierna.    Ella insisti hasta que finalmente l le permitio ayudarlo; ella gentilmente le separ las manos y lo acost a su lado, le desabroch los pantalones, puso sus manos dentro y comenz a masajear.

En la siguiente sala, un hombre estaba colgado de los brazos y lo estaban azotando con un ltigo con puntas de hierro. El tipo sacudi la cabeza en se?al de disgusto.  Finalmente, pasaron a la ltima sala, donde otro hombre estaba atado a la pared, totalmente desnudo. Una mujer escultural le estaba prcticando   s e x o oral. El tipo indica:    "S, s, aqu es donde quiero empezar".  El diablo le pregunt:  "?Ests seguro? Te recuerdo que esto va a durar mil a?os".  "S, estoy seguro. ste es el lugar".

He's rarely allowed to play in any casino because he is a winner. Jake has taken in so much money over the years, he is the only client of his accountant and older brother Billy. One night, Jake, Billy and their other brother Joe are invited to sit in on a private game, where Jake is expected to lose to Dorothy Macha, a crime boss and local casino owner who can't play for squat, but always wins because people are too scared to beat him. Jake isn't afraid of Macha, and not only beats Dorothy in a quick game of chance, but takes every possible opportunity to insult the man. Jake and his brothers leave the game, and Macha puts out the order for a hit on Jake, who ends up working for and being protected by a pair of brothers, Avi and Zack, who are out to take Macha down.

These are all "free" stations (the free are in quotations because nothing is actually free).  Now, if I understand correctly, when you do get the Dish satellite or the Direct TV satellite, you get so many different cable stations BUT, I was told that for the channels listed above, you would have to pay for it. Kind of like the reverse of just having regular channels and then paying for HBO  and Showtime and Cinemax.  But, I am not sure who is your cable company. I am in North eastern New Jersey, right outside the New York area, and I have Comcast. Some towns (like Newark and Sout Orange) have Cablevision. New York has Time Warner. But, the general idea is that the "free" stations are the prime numbers and the "pay" stations are the HBO's and the Showtime's and the Cinemax's and what have you. The stations that you do not have to pay for would be like ABC Family channel, Bravo, The Discovery Channel and other cable stations that you can get if you have the box or "basic" cable.|`|7eafbf273bddc337e8ddec8b39509020aa	USUSALLY FREE .

As imagens da apresentadora e modelo namorando o empresrio Renato Malzoni Filho, 33, conhecido como Tato, nas areias de uma praia na cidade de Tarifa, em Cdiz (Andaluzia, sul da Espanha), rodaram o mundo e ganharam espa?o em diversos sites internacionais.    A pgina do programa de TV "Aqu Hay Tomate", da emissora espanhola Telecinco, reproduz o vdeo em meio a frases pouco discretas: "A ex de Ronaldo se satisfaz e seu amiguinho fica alegre. Pela frente e por trs", diz o texto inserido entre as imagens editadas.    O site diz ainda que a modelo era praticamente desconhecida na Espanha at encontrar o Fen?meno, que fez seu cach subir significativamente. "Aps sua ruptura com Ronaldo, Daniela Cicarelli refez sua vida. Esta brasileira de sangue quente passou alguns dias na praia de Tarifa, onde n?o se importou em dar uns 'amassos' em seu namorado", afirma a pgina.    Reprodu??o      Casal foi flagrado em cenas de intimidade     A publica??o "Intervi", tambm espanhola, descreveu as frias da modelo e do empresrio em Cdiz, afirmando que saram todas as noites e que n?o se importaram com os olhares dos turistas enquanto se beijavam e abra?avam de forma chamativa. O site tambm reproduz imagens feitas a partir do vdeo que circula na internet.    J o site do jornal "La Voz de Cdiz", que reproduz a vers?o impressa da publica??o, se limita a descrever parte das cenas, dizendo que a "ex de Ronaldo e seu namorado", aps trocarem carinhos na areia, tiveram de ir para o mar "juntinhos". No sbado (16), o italiano "Affari Italiani" j citava que o casal havia protagonizado "cenas fortes" na praia espanhola.    Vdeo    O vdeo que mostra Cicarelli e Malzoni chegou inicialmente ao YouTube no ltimo domingo. As duas primeiras cpias do material foram tiradas do ar pelo administrador do site na manh? de segunda-feira, sob alega??o de "viola??o dos termos de uso". Diversas outras cpias, porm, est?o sendo disponibilizadas no site, que as remove poucos minutos aps entrarem no ar.    Com pouco mais de quatro minutos, o material come?a com cenas de beijos e abra?os de Cicarelli e Malzoni na areia. Em seguida, o clima come?a a esquentar. O casal levanta da areia e, num passeio na beira d'gua, protagoniza carinhos e intimidades que devem ter feito os freqentadores da praia espanhola corarem.    Sem conseguir se controlar, Malzoni abra?a a modelo, que fica de costas para ele e recebe beijos na nuca. Abra?ados, os dois trocam carinhos n?o recomendados em pblico. No pice da intimidade, a dupla resolve entrar no mar, onde o namoro continua.    Apesar da decis?o do Youtube, diversos sites --inclusive blogs-- disponibilizam o vdeo livremente.

Com o passar do tempo, alm de ela n?o ter mais a Marlene Matos a frente de tudo, a forma de conquistar as crian?as foi modificada, porm sem atrativos. A Xuxa se perdeu no meio do caminho e n?o sabe mais como entreter a crian?ada.   Eu vivi a poca de ouro dela, agora  deixar que outras pessoas tenham oportunidade de colocar coisas novas na televis?o, pois  o que falta.  Ela deveria fazer um programa voltado para adolescentes, fez isso uma vez (Xuxa Park, se lembram???), continuar fazendo filmes... (msica n?o, pq n?o sabe cantar, desafinada!!!!)

Muito interessante tambm a atitude otimista do pai deles, que apostou alto, mesmo n?o sendo compreendido por outros. a m?e tambm se mostrou uma mulher de garra, suportando situa??es difceis em nome do amor. E outra pessoa que me surpreendeu foi a Zilu, que como vimos, deu muito apoio ao Zez nos momentos mais difceis, sempre colocando-o pra cima, incentivando-o e at indo  luta trabalhar para que ele pudesse perseguir o sonho.

Bought a bunch of flowers, just for her,   She says the burden's on the receiver.     I opened the door and you walked in,   (Sniff) The scent of wild jasmine.   The room, seemed to freeze in time,   My regular table will be just fine.     Radiant and elegant, you might be   But your concentration is so go-lightly   Both of your eyes reflecting the moon,   You really think you own the room.     CHORUS:   So What Game Shall We Play Today?   How About The One Where You Don't Get Your Way?   But Even If You Do,   That's Okay.   So What Game Shall We Play Today?   How About The One Where You Don't Get Your Way?   But Even If You Do,   That's Okay.     Try to pick it up, reading the signs,   It's turning out to be a real good time,   And who'd have thought that entertainment,   Lies in the winter of your discontent.     Now, sit at the table, face to face,   Queen takes pawn, check or checkmate!   I feel your foot brush against my leg,   I'm not that easily led.     You flutter your eyes and you toss your hair,   I have to say that it is kind of unfair,   Let me tell you baby now what's in store,   You win the battle, but I'll win the war!     CHORUS     This has been fun, I suppose,   Although my feelings are all juxtaposed,   But truth be told, I'm as fickle as hell,   But gentlemen never kiss and tell!

Not only that but some of the music you download can also carry a virus with it. Limewire used to be a really cool and easy program to download music from but everytime I attempt to download a song nowadays, it downloads and then plays absolutely nothing or only 5 seconds of the song then goes blank. So, I've come to realize paying a little money for music is a whole lot safer and less frusterating than downloading free music.     Try this site, www.gomusic.ru/    it's like 15 cents a song, $1.50 for the whole album, it varies but all you do is sign up, put down some money (I put down $20) so I have $20 worth of music to download, plus they give 30 free songs. I put down the money about 3 months ago and I still have $15 left plus my 30 free songs. All the songs are virus free and are the whole song! Takes about the same amount of time to download each song as it would for Limewire or any other program you use. I really like it and would recommend it to anyone who's fed up with downloading crappy versions of songs.    If you do not want to pay for music (that's the only part that sucks about that web site), try going to download.com and find a better free music provider.     Good luck!|`|AA12084728	Yeah Limewire is good I used it all the time. The only problem is sometimes it would say one thing and be another. Yes it is possible to get a virus just make sure you have protection against them and you should be good. Most of them is not really harmful just some adware. If you do catch one make sure you delete it right away and run your adware program.|`|e59af6208e1e56a90f8ba7a9ec28b025aa	I dont trust any downloading clients except limewire, it seems to be the only one that doesnt totally trash my computer with spyware.

8069521411ae5c50aa391787ae1886e1aa	Hi, for me, i got it from Yahoo Auction when there's a young guy selling off his brand-new ipod at SGD$400 as he doesnt listen to songs on the move. THat is a good $150plus of discount for me! You can try it Yahoo!Auction.   But however, do arrange to see the set before clicking the 'buy' or 'bid' button as some sellers are not truthful. They might put up a brand new looking ipod picture and when you actually buy over, you will get some 2nd-handed looking ipod.  Good Luck!|`|AA10726551	I am buying my girlfriend one for Christmas.

Take pictures while you're playing, and enter the pictures into baby photo contests instead-- less stressful on the child than dragging him/her to photoshoots and forcing a fussy toddler to behave and pose, let alone if you continue when they're older and they never develop a sense of security and normalacy in their life and don't know how to behave in the real world.|`|f2df320fc50e6b07c06df1942c5b43feaa	First of all i would advise to try internet modeling sites.

Artist: Air Supply Lyrics    Song: Making Love Out Of Nothing At All Lyrics        I know just how to whisper   And I know just how to cry   I know just where to find the answers   And I know just how to lie   I know just how to fake it   And I know just how to scheme   I know just when to face the truth   And then I know just when to dream       And I know just where to touch you   And I know just what to prove   I know when to pull you closer   And I know when to let you loose   And I know the night is fading   And I know the time's gonna fly   And I'm never gonna tell you   Everything I gotta tell you   But I know I gotta give it a try       And I know the roads to riches   And I know the ways to fame   I know all the rules   And I know how to break 'em   And I always know the name of the game       But I don't know how to leave you   And I'll never let you fall   And I don't know how you do it   Making love out of nothing at all       Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all   Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all   Out of nothing at all,   Making love out of nothing at all       Everytime I see you all the rays of the sun   Are streaming through the waves in your hair   And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes   Like a spotlight       The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost   And it's looking for a rhythm like you   You can take the darkness from the pit of the night   And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright       I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know   Well it's nothing till I give it to you       I can make the runner stumble   I can make the final block   I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle   I can make all the stadiums rock   I can make tonight forever   Or I can make it disappear by the dawn   I can make every promise that has ever been made   I can make all your demons be gone       But I'm never gonna make it without you   Do you really want to see me crawl   And I'm never gonna make it like you do   Making love out of nothing at all       Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all   Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all   Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all   Out of nothing at all|`|2cfaadfd7f1848472d4d85d15c66d005aa	The only one I can think of is Air Supply - the song Making Love (out of nothing at all)????

AA11198552	Pregnant Hi-5 star bows out  By Phillip Koch  February 26, 2006      HI-5 star Kathleen de Leon yesterday confirmed she is four months pregnant and will temporarily leave the hit children's band to concentrate on motherhood.      Overjoyed: Daniel Jones and Kathleen de Leon at their wedding  "We're over-the-moon," she said. "We just came back from our honeymoon and found out. It was a wonderful surprise. I've been pretty blessed."    The singer married Savage Garden star Daniel Jones on the Gold Coast in October last year with the couple honeymooning in Venice, the Greek Islands, Switzerland and Thailand.    "Daniel is so over the moon  he is looking forward to it so much," she said.    Since Hi-5 was launched seven years ago, de Leon, 28, and the four other band members have become famous around the world.    "They all cried when I told them," confided de Leon, who plans to complete a two-month tour of the UK and Singapore before going on maternity leave.

Muri de un infarto pero unos minutos antes le dijo a mi ta "la ni?a ya no viene" refiriendose a m. Mi mam cuando lleg a la casa me dijo que yo saba y no le haba dicho nada (an hoy lo cree). Mi beb igual se enferm desde ese da con neumona y no pude ir al entierro ni a los rezos, ya que estuvo enfermo durante 10 das. No recuerdo otra navidad ms triste y angustiosa.  Sin embargo, la he sentido siempre a mi lado acompa?andome y ayudndome a resolver todos los problemas de mi vida. Gracias abuela.

Victor Andres Mendoza|`|722d6143620f4932c5febf66e173ad7eaa	lo que pasa es que tiene dos explicaciones la del cine y la de nuestras vidas. te dire primero la del cine. Lo que pasa es que los humanos empezaron a construir maquinas robots capaces de servirnos como humanos, se fueron haciendo tan buenos que hasta podian tener sentimientos. Asi que los humanos los empezamos abusar de ellos, les poniamos tareas dificiles como si fueran esclavos. asi que un dia los robots hicienron un comite y pedian derechos como si fueran humanos, querian que los trataran igual. Obiamente los humanos se molestaron y rechazaron la propuesta, pero ala vez empezaron a esterminarlos para que algun dia no se revelaran ante nosotros. pero muchos robots sobrevivieron y entre ellos mismos construyeron mas robots para hacerle guerra alos humanos, asi que la guerra comenzo y nosotros ibamos perdiendo asi que fue ahi cuando taparon el sol para que los robots no tuvieran energia  si te fijas en Matrix 3 trinity es la unica humana que vio el sol real. bueno pero los robots se dieron cuenta que nosotros los humanos producimos calor que se puede transformar en energia, asi que ahi fue donde empezo Matrix 1 cuando nos usan en encubadoras para sacarnos energia y nos hacen creer que estamos viviendo pero en realidad somos sus exclavos, ahi es donde Neo es el que los va ha salvar. y lo demas pues ya lo viste en las peliculas.  La segunda es que se compara Matrix con nuestras vidas, podemos ser esclavos del gobierno sin darnos cuenta, o las compu se estan volviendo mas sotificadas, y muchas mas.  Pero eso ya es otro rollo  Ami el final no me gusto porque se mueren trinity y Neo.  ademas ahi no termina porque las maquinas no fueron vencidas solo hicieron la paz|`|27a0f24b84cd48dbaf4d685f8975e4c8aa	Para que puedas entenderlas un poco mejor podrias ver la pelicula de ANIMATRIX en especial los videos del segundo renacimiento.  Pero como quieres que te las expliquen ahi teva un resumen de como empez todo:  Resulta que el ser humano empez a usar a las maquinas para hacerse de lavores pesadas y aburridas, cada dia la hacia mas complejas al punto de que cre la inteligencia artificial, aunque la maquinas eran "leales" a los humanos no obtenian el respeto de ellos (osea nosotros) y existi un robot que termino matando a sus amos, (que tiene que ver con las peliculas, a eso voy no desesperais).  Como sea al robot le terminaron haciendo un juicio donde lo condenaron a ser destruido junto con todos los de su tipo y asi el hombre destruyo a millones de maquinas y a los que quedaron "con vida" fueron desterrados y al final estos robots desterrados formaron su propia nacion, curiosamente donde fue la cuna de la civilizacin humana.  Pasaban los a?os y esta nacion prsperaba mucho mas rapido que las naciones del hombre, las maquinas incluso piden formar parte de la ONU pero por el orgullo del hombre no los aceptaron y adems por miedo a ser superados la raza humana inicio una guerra contra las maquinas.  Esta guerra la perdio el hombre ya que las maquinas no eran afectadas por las armas del ser humano, desesperados por la derrota los ejercitos, decidieron acabar con la fuente de energia que tenian (el sol) y de esa froma cubrio el sol con nubes negras haciendo que el firmamento fuera obscuro y nunca mas se viera el sol.  Pero eso no detuvo a las maquinasporsupuesto tenian otras formas de conseguir energia y tras a?os de analisar las estructuras del cuerpo humano se dieron cuenta que el cerebro producia reacciones bioquimioelectricas y empez a usar los cuerpos de los humanos como baterias siempre renobables.  Finalmente, al darse cuenta que los ejercitos de las maquinas eran invenciblese el ser humano se rindio para no sufrir mas y asepto servir a las maquinas y las maquinas como un pacto a todos aquellos seres humanos que sirven como baterias se les puso en un simulador que les mostraba una vida en la epoca del esplendor de la raza humana.  Sin embargo algunas personas despertaron del sue?o inducido por las maquinas y formaron una resistencia contra ellas llamada Zion en fin espero te hayan servido estos antecedentes.

Sin embargo, queda muy lejos de la pelcula de mayor duracin de todos los tiempos. Y es que la pelcula ms larga de la historia dura la friolera de 5.220 minutos. O lo que es lo mismo, 87 horas. Vamos, que si usted tiene 3 das y 15 horas libres... la puede ver sin problemas. Si la quisiramos ver en DVD la cinta ocupara entre 18 y 22 discos...   El titulo del film es "The cure for insomnia", que traducido quiere decir "El remedio contra el insomnio", lo que da una idea de para que podemos ver la pelcula...   Solo tenia un nico actor en pantalla, Lee Groban (un poeta y artista visionario), y fue rodada en 1986, bajo la direccin de John Henry Timmis IV.   Estoy dudando si adelantarles el argumento, no vaya a ser que les fastidie la trama... bueno, voy a contrselo...   En realidad es bastante simple, la pelcula nos muestra al actor principal y nico, Lee Groba, leyendo un poema suyo de 4.800 pginas, interrumpido nicamente por fragmentos de pelculas XXX y heavy metal. Estos cortes sern para darle mas vida al film, supongo!   nicamente se ha proyectado una vez sin cortes, y fue el da de su estreno, el 31 de enero de 1987, en la escuela del Instituto de Arte de Chicago. El propsito original era el de "reprogramar" el cerebro de las personas que sufran insomnio y visionasen la cinta...   Yo al menos espero que no te hayas dormido leyendo la noticia, para eso est la pelicula!|`|f7c35c2be94951c37661c4000b11b443aa	BEN HUR.

f94KGqrraa	Es triste ver en la televisin este tipo de programas. En lo personal, la mayor parte de los productos que nos presenta este medio masivo no es ms que basura, que no aporta nada bueno a nuestra sociedad. En cierto modo reflejan una parcela de nuestra cultura la cual deja claro que al pueblo mexicano le encantan estos programillas y frecuentemente se ven atraidos por situaciones, temas, programas que lo nico que hacen es ayudarlos a escapar de su realidad aunque sea por una hora (no se cuanto dura el dichoso show de besos y arrumacos), y que los mantienen en un estado de verdadera ignorancia.  Sin duda, 12 corazones es uno ms de esos programas. No veo el sentido de ir a un show a buscar pareja -?de plano es tanta la urgencia?, ?una persona no es capaz de encontrarla de un modo ms "normal" valiendose de sus propias cualidades y no de lo que los signos del zodiaco hablen de mi o digan "cmo" soy?, ?quieren fama o de veras quieren amor? En serio ??qu onda?! sea lo que sea, no s que hacen ah... a menos que la paga  $$$ sea buena. Por otra parte, tal como muchos otros, 12 corazones, por lo poco que he aguantado verlo, me parece de lo ms vanal, superficial y tonto que puede haber. No es posible que se mantenga a las personas embobadas de este modo en vez de procurarles ambientes que en verdad mejoren su cultura -o si ya de plano por ningun motivo gustan de observar programas culturales o cientficos-  pues almenos deberian ocupar su tiempo en otras cosas. S que es dificil puesto que al pueblo mexicano lo han acostumbrado a esto de las telenovelas, realities, etc, etc... y tal parece que no piensa mover ni un dedo para exigir una television de calidad. En fin, me aflige que la gente se deje llevar por lo "atractivo" de estos programas, aunque aclaro, no todos pensamos igual, afortunadamente.

Datos y cifras   --------------------------------------...     Pas(es) Estados Unidos   A?o 1972   Gnero Gngsters   Duracin 175 minutos   El Padrino es una pelcula estadounidense de 1972 basada en el libro de Mario Puzo y dirigida por Francis Ford Coppola.    Pelcula basada en el libro, del mismo nombre, de Mario Puzo. Fue la primera de una triloga completada por El Padrino II (1974) y El Padrino III (1990). Ganadora de tres Premios Oscar en 1973, a la mejor pelcula, mejor guin de Mario Puzo y Francis Ford Coppola y mejor actor para Marlon Brando.    Presenta un retrato preciso y profundo de una poca y un ambiente, pero sobre todo es una crtica subrepticia a la sociedad norteamericana, las relaciones intrafamiliares, la prctica poltica y sus esquemas morales tratados sutilmente como trasfondo del guin mediante temticas relativas al mundo de la mafia, la inmigracin, la relacin de pareja, los sistemas de dominacin familiares, la violencia criminal y su asociacin poltica, etc.    Parte del atractivo visual y estilstico de la obra consiste en la interpretacin de la figura de Michael Corleone. En la secuencia inicial de la pelcula Michael se nos presenta con rostro angelical, incluso Coppola emplea filtros especiales que reducen sus arrugas y combinados con la iluminacin y el maquillaje nos ense?an un Michael mucho ms joven, recin abandonada la adolescencia. El brutal cambio que se opera en su alma cuando asume la herencia de sangre de los Corleone se refleja tambin en su rostro, que en la ltima escena es ya el de un hombre maduro, complejo, que mira directamente a los ojos y miente con todo su corazn.      Argumento  Don Vito Corleone es el jefe de una de las cinco familias mafiosas ms importantes de Nueva York en los a?os 40: los Tattaglia, los Stracci, los Barzini, los Cuneo y los Corleone. Cuando rechaza participar en el negocio del narcotrfico se inicia una cruenta guerra entre las bandas que casi acaba con su vida. Es entonces cuando el hijo menor, Michael, decide tomar las riendas de la organizacin, transformndose en un jefe fro e inteligente que acabar con los enemigos y rivales de la familia, convirtindola as en la ms poderosa de la industria del crimen organizado en Nueva York.

Non ho nulla contro di lei ma penso che abbia dato un'immagine troppo sbagliata di se stessa per poter restare in televisione. Purtroppo ormai  un fenomeno diffuso che chiunque venga accusato da un tribunale diventi un fenomeno mediatico. Alcuni esempi sono la Franzoni del caso Cogne, Luciano Moggi, Fabrizio Corona e tanti altri che sfruttano la televisione per cercare sostegno in stupidi ed ingenui adolescenti che vedono in loro dei modelli e dei miti. Il bello  che anche chi fa televisione si lamenta di tutto questo essendo egli stesso la causa.

SkRJNhuCaa	WHY specifically a Yamaha?    Yes, a smaller size instrument will sound different.    What you should do is learn to play a fullsize instrument (it just takes some getting used to unless you're extremely slow, like a 10 year old child or smaller).    A smaller model fullsize guitar (yes, they come in different shapes and sizes) would be a Grand Auditorium (the grand doesn't refer to the size of the instrument) shaped guitar.  They generally have excellent body of sound and are easier to hold than are Dreadnoughts and Jumbos.    Without knowing your budget it's of course impossible to give specific recommendations, except that you should look beyond Yamaha.    Tanglewood, Washburn, Ibanez, to name a few, all make excellent instruments that aren't going to break the bank.  Martin and Taylor are more expensive, but it shows in the quality. They're the standard any manufacturer aims for.|`|EQm2iCpaaa	Yamaha makes a nice model for ladies.  My sister has one and it sounds great.
