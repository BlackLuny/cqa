20090227141949AA97ZVG	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	College dilemma... please help!?	Ok, so currently I'm pretty set on becoming a pharmacist and have received admission to the following schools: Drake University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Purdue University, and University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Michigan.      Now, here are there pharmacy graduate program rankings (I'll be undergrad but this is for the future)      UMICH- #2   UIC- #9   Purdue #9   Wisc- #11   Drake (in des moines) #51      Now, right now Drake is my first choice because it's not huge like wisc and not right next door like UIC.. Michigan is verrrry expensive an purdue is also one of those schools that has gigantic lectures and overall populations.      My question is though, would it be a mistake to choose drake over the other schools? I mean, How much to employers look at the ranking of the school when you apply for a job? I know Michigan is very prestigious, but it's also a big school and very expensive. I read somewhere that going to drake might hurt you in getting a job because it's not well known and not as prestigious (it is a good pharmacy school though #51 isn't bad). Also, it's in Des Moines, not a terribly large/well known city.      Is it possible to go to drake's undergrad and transfer to UMICH for grad? or would they not accept my credits?      Please, I really need advice on where I should go!

I have never really chosen what I wanted to be and we have to choose our options next year and I'm worried! I want to do something to do with helping animals but couldn't be a vet as every time I see an animal in pain I start crying so I thought about being a marine biologist, like study the coral reefs, but there are hardly and job options in marine biology for practical work and I don't want to be stuck in an office all day. So, I decided to be a primary school teacher but don't have a passion for that like I do with marine biology! Can someone help me decide what would be best for me and what classes I need for either marine biology or primary school teacher! Thanks!      PS. I don't want to do Biology as a subject as I am vegetarian and believe using animal parts to view is barbaric!
