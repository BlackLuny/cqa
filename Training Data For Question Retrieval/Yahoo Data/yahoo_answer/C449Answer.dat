This seals the small gaps in the tape. THEN paint on the new color of the stripe.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	Another thing I've seen is any clear glaze, and you only paint the edges of the tape.|`|Lg4cmiL5aa	I have seen the episode but sorry still do not know what it is either. I have painted for many years and this seems to be a problem for everyone, I do not know why. There are two ways to get around it. After putting the tape down use the back of your fingernail to go down the edges of the tape. Most walls are not smooth therefore the paint gets in the gaps where the texture is raised. If you seal those gaps the paint doesn't get in. You just need to take time to seal it. The other way to help is when painting over the stripes paint in the direction away from the edge, or directly over the edge. Do not go toward the direction of the edge that pushes it under the tape. But good luck either way.
76JPOo3Raa	black mold is very hard to get rid of and dangerous to inhale.bleach and water should work to clean it up.if it comes back, repeat the process again.also,an old toothbrush would be a good cleaning tool.|`|jWtquDVUaa	Hi, after you find and fix the cause,use bleach to kill and clean it off. On the door gasket it will be best if you remove the gasket put it in a tub or basin to clean it in good shape. Then clean the refrigerator surface with bleach as well, before you put it back on. If you can't get it removed from the gasket, you may have to buy a new one. Depending on the refrigerator they are around $40 to $60.00.<br>  Good Luck|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Bleach water.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Rice appears to have been used by the Early Neolithic populations of Lijiacun and Yunchanyan. Evidence of possible rice cultivation in China from ca. 11,500 BP has been found, however it is still questioned whether the rice was indeed being cultivated, or instead being gathered as wild rice.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryza_sativa#History_of_domestication_.26_cultivation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryza_sativ...</a>|`|944iJNAdaa	History of domestication & cultivation<br>  <br>  Based on one chloroplast and two nuclear gene regions, Londo et al (2006) conclude that Oryza sativa rice was domesticated at least twice—indica in eastern India, Myanmar and Thailand; and japonica in southern China—though they concede that there is archaeological and genetic evidence for a single domestication of rice in the lowlands of China.[5]<br>  Abstract pattern of terrace rice fields in Yuanyang, Yunnan Province, southern China.<br>  <br>  Because the functional allele for non-shattering—the critical indicator of domestication in grains—as well as five other single nucleotide polymorphisms, is identical in both indica and japonica, Vaughan et al (2008) determined that there was a single domestication event for Oryza sativa in the region of the Yangtze river valley.[6]<br>  <br>  [edit] Continental East Asia<br>  <br>  Rice appears to have been used by the Early Neolithic populations of Lijiacun and Yunchanyan.[7] Evidence of possible rice cultivation in China from ca. 11,500 BP has been found, however it is still questioned whether the rice was indeed being cultivated, or instead being gathered as wild rice.[8] Bruce Smith, an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., who has written on the origins of agriculture, says that evidence has been mounting that the Yangtze was probably the site of the earliest rice cultivation.[9]<br>  <br>  Zhao (1998) argues that collection of wild rice in the Late Pleistocene had, by 6400 BC, led to the use of primarily domesticated rice.[10] Morphological studies of rice phytoliths from the Diaotonghuan archaeological site clearly show the transition from the collection of wild rice to the cultivation of domesticated rice. The large number of wild rice phytoliths at the Diaotonghuan level dating from 12,000-11,000 BP indicates that wild rice collection was part of the local means of subsistence. Changes in the morphology of Diaotonghuan phytoliths dating from 10,000-8,000 BP show that rice had by this time been domesticated.[11] Analysis of Chinese rice residues from Pengtoushan which were C14(carbon dating) dated to 8200-7800 BCE show that rice had been domesticated by this time.[12]<br>  <br>  In 1998, Crawford & Shen reported that the earliest of 14 AMS or radiocarbon dates on rice from at least nine Early to Middle Neolithic sides is no older than 7000 BC, that rice from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao sites indicates that rice domestication likely began before 5000 BC, but that most sites in China from which rice remains have been recovered are younger than 5000 BC.[7]<br>  <br>  [edit] South Asia<br>  Paddy fields in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu<br>  <br>  Wild Oryza rice appeared in the Belan and Ganges valley regions of northern India as early as 4530 BC and 5440 BC respectively,[13] although many believe it may have appeared earlier. The Encyclopedia Britannica—on the subject of the first certain cultivated rice—holds that:[14]<br>  Many cultures have evidence of early rice cultivation, including China, India, and the civilizations of Southeast Asia. However, the earliest archaeological evidence comes from central and eastern China and dates to 7000–5000 BC.<br>  <br>  Denis J. Murphy (2007) further details the spread of cultivated rice from India into South-east Asia:[15]<br>  Several wild cereals, including rice, grew in the Vindhyan Hills, and rice cultivation, at sites such as Chopani-Mando and Mahagara, may have been underway as early as 7000 BP. The relative isolation of this area and the early development of rice farming imply that it was developed indigenously.<br>  <br>  Chopani-Mando and Mahagara are located on the upper reaches of the Ganges drainage system and it is likely that migrants from this area spread rice farming down the Ganges valley into the fertile plains of Bengal, and beyond into south-east Asia.<br>  <br>  Rice was cultivated in the Indus Valley Civilization.[16] Agricultural activity during the second millennium BC included rice cultivation in the Kashmir and Harrappan regions.[13] Mixed farming was the basis of Indus valley economy.[16]<br>  <br>  Punjab is the largest producer and consumer of rice in India.<br>  <br>  [edit] Korean peninsula and Japanese archipelago<br>  Utagawa Hiroshige, Rice field in Oki province, view of O-Yama.<br>  <br>  Mainstream archaeological evidence derived from palaeoethnobotanical investigations indicate that dry-land rice was introduced to Korea and Japan some time between 3500 and 1200 BC. The cultivation of rice in Korea and Japan during that time occurred on a small-scale, fields were impermanent plots, and evidence shows that in some cases domesticated and wild grains were planted together. The technological, subsistence, and social impact of rice and grain cultivation is not evident in archaeological data until after 1500 BC. For example, intensive wet-paddy rice agriculture was introduced into Korea shortly before or during the Middle Mumun Pottery Period (c. 850–550 BC) and reached Japan by the Final Jōmon or Initial Yayoi circa 300 BC.[17][7]<br>  <br>  In 2

Experts recommend watering roses thoroughly twice a week. It would also depend on the amount of sunlight that is reaching your rose plant. Water these roses frequently for the first 2-3 weeks. This is needed because the top layer of the soil tends to remain dry.<br>  <br>  To grow roses, you would also need to take into account that some organic matter would be needed to add to the soil This would help to enrich the soil and also nourish the roots of the plants. Use organic matter like manure for better results. <br>  <br>  <br>  Other things you can give Roses to help increase blooms is Banana a peels and wood ash because banana's and wood ash has lots of potassium, just the thing to encourage blooms.

After their leaves were up, though, and the plant started receiving sunshine and the energy in the seed was used up, the plants in tissue would start suffering from lack of nutrients, and the plants in soil would continue growing vigorously.

You can also, try dotting bleach on a tiny spot, and let sit then wipe up completely over and over with a wet rag, if this removes the color, do more small areas, but get all the bleach out, thats why you do small parts at a time. Once its all bleached out,snip some fibers from a closet, go up to a arts crafts store and get a permanent marker that matches really well, and dot on color until its all done, let areas dry before doing it all, a stain or sorts is better than black ink.

The rose thorns (technically they are prickles, not thorns)  enable the rose to grab on to other plants and grow up towards the sun.  <br>  <br>  Rose prickles are not particularly good protection for the plant;  any gardener whose roses have been completely eaten by deer or rabbits can tell you this!  <br>  <br>  Incidentally, the difference between a prickle and a leaf is that a prickle is a modified leaf, while a thorn is a modified stem.

I have never had a bug. Wherever I move , it starts out bugs, but once I am there...no mo ever ever ever. Heres the trick. Boric Acid. Go to your Dollar Store and purchase a huge bottle of it, usually in the laundry detergent dept. Make sure it says like 98% Boric Acid. Shouldnt cost but 2-3 dollars. <br>  Take it home and spread it behind everything. It is a powder. Under the sink, behind stove, refrigerator, threshholds of doors, outside around doorways, windows, behind washer dryer, bathroom, in cabinets, sweeping it against the walls all the cracks and crevices, lining the walls, get the picture? <br>  Now to explain about this stuff. You never have to clean it up. Leave it. It is not a poison, so it wont harm your pets. It does not work immediatly, but once it kicks in, THEY ARE GONE FOREVER. Once the bug crawls across it, it sticks to their feet and body, they drag it back to the nest, it gets all over the rest of them. It slices them up on the inside. Like glass in their systems. Once they are dead, the particles are there, and the newly hatched eggs have to walk over it to demolish the whole bunch. Once that happens. It's done. Thats why it takes a while to kick in. If one happens to get in, give it a day or two and it will die. So if you are in an apartment, you can kill those too. Because they will eventually go back and infest the rest. It works on anything that crawls. <br>  Now give me the 10 points!!!!

They love fast food - oil, white flour, and sugar. They can also eat soap. Clean the surfaces that human beings normally see, then clean the dark areas where cockroaches live. Clean behind and under your fridge, clean your pantries. When the mess is cleaned up, put every food-like item into plastic containers (like tupperware), and make it so no cockroach could get in. <br>  <br>  If theres anything that a cockroach loves more than living in the dark covered in its own waste its doing that with 100,000 other cockroaches. Sanitize all surfaces that would otherwise be covered in roach manure. Bring light and cleanliness into the areas where they would live. <br>  <br>  Keep the perimeters of your home secured so that no cockroach can live through it. <br>  <br>  Try buying roach traps, specifically the ones that kill the eggs too. Killing the offspring means that eventually the rest will die. <br>  <br>  If you use bug bombs, don't fill your house with them and stay inside. Exit first, and don't start any fires. <br>  <br>  Call the pest control guys and ask them.|`|EFM5nn9daa	use boric acid to make a line wherever you do not want them to cross. They cannot cross boric acid.  So you need to kill there water source, without this they cant survive. Also make a perimeter so they stay out. Chances are your neighbors have this problem and they are coming from over there after you kill them in your house.  Use the Roach motels and a perimeter of boric acid they will be gone also eliminate water sources by perimeter of boric acid.|`|LBcHM3K1aa	An enviroment-friendly-method that I use is gather all old left over beers and pour an inch or two high in cans put them under plants around your garden and also under your sink, in dark places and also where you always see them.

It's an easy swap.|`|D6bBwVaIaa	if your pump does come on does it circulate water through the spa? if the pump comes on and does not circulate water then you might have an air lock. if so the you should use a water hose and put it up next to the jets and run water through everyone of them. this forces air out and water in and may clear up your problem. also check to see if any valves might have been closed when the spa was moved.
AA11313361	Home Depot/Lowes actually have them.  But they don't sell them.  They discard them after everyone purchases the wire.  So, if you want them from them you'll have to go dumpster diving.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to contact an electrician and ask him if you could buy an empty one from him for a few bucks when he was done.  Considering that he would normally toss it in the garbage, he'd probably take you up on the offer.<br>  <br>  Your next best bet would be to go ask a line worker for either a telicom company (like verizon) or the electric company.  If you see someone working on the line, ask him where you could get one.  He might have an empty one in the truck he'd probably give to you.|`|IKKVM3t6aa	You could try going to your local cable office.  They usally have a bunch of them sitting around.

If you need additional storage space, put your bed on a frame, and use plastic containers with lids to store stuff, whether it be clothes, or christmas decorations.  If  you do not have a need for storage, go for the on-the-floor bed.  My kids love this.  And when we buy bedding, especially bed-in-a-bag, we use the bed skirt  material to make extra pillows, and picture frames, and even valances for the window.   To make the picture frames,  get some thick cardboard and cut out frames, then cover them with the material.  Add jewels and pom poms from the local craft store, and put them on the walls.  It adds a lot to the room.  "Poor"  is only a state of mind.  Get real, mom!!
