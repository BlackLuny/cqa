Of these, which do you think have the most difficult time finding clothes?      1. Tall and skinny (Model Body, 5'8"+, Inseam 34+, Size 2 or less)   2. Short and skinny (5'2" or less, Inseam 28 or less, Size 2 or less)   3. Tall and curvy but not fat (Same as #1 but is curvy (Bust/hips are more than 10 inches larger than waist. Can fit any size)   4. Short and curvy but not fat    5. Tall and Large (Size 16+)   6. Short and Large.      I fit the short and curvy group and it's a pain finding clothes. Almost everything makes me look pregnant and is way too long. My inseam is longer than 28 but it's still a pain trying to find pants because apparently most stores right now consider a regular 32-33 and some stores don't carry a short (30-31), which would fit me just right. I think tall and skinny has it easy right now. My friend is 5'10" and is thin and she can wear most clothes right off the rack.

Obviously, there is a new trend emerging -       instead of cutting diamonds to show off a diamond's worth, there are now UNCUT diamonds for jewelery - like rings...      Here is my question though, what would one expect to pay for and uncut diamond ring? I mean, generally you would judge and price a diamond by the 4 C's...so if you don't actually CUT the diamond to more clearly evaluate the C's...then how do you evaluate whether it's priced correctly?      I'm just curious what you think. Also, if anyone has any link for somewhat INexpensive UNcut diamond rings for me to browse...that would be cool too! : ) Thanks!

20090205100843AABP2jx	Beauty & Style;Hair	How do I correct dyed hair from blonde back to dark brown or lighter?	A few days ago I colored my hair blonde, it was already dyed a few months ago and the shade wasn't as blonde as I wanted and it turned out more strawberry blonde, so since my roots were showing I decided to go lighter and bought a lightener in the blondest I could find and let it set on my roots longer then the rest like I would have always done when I dyed it before but that was red colors. Now my roots are bright blonde and the rest is orange-blonde. I would like to just make it a little darker, but if not I would settle with a lighter brown than my natural color. It's just to bright blonde. I have really oily hair so color doesn't hurt it, in fact it takes a lot of the oil out and makes my hair more manageable, but I don't want to fry my hair. Please help!

I've had it since it was a kid and it used to be kind of cute as it was dark, smaller and pretty flat. Well, as the years have passed, it's turned flesh colored and grown a bit so that it now has it's own profile and not as cute as it used to be. It's starting to remind me of a scaled down pencil eraser. I'd like to remove it before it grows any larger and I become the woman with that thing on her face. Wondering though if a dermatologist will do a good job or i should see a plastic surgeon. My face is otherwise perfectly clear and don't want to end up with a prominent scar. Anyone been through this and had good results with either doctor???

Well I bought this serum which is meant to help your hair go curly not frizzy, and I accidentally put too much on my hands, and slapped it onto the front of my hair.

My hair has looked greasy ever since and it feels like plastic, I think it's from the serum, as it only happened after I put it on.   It just doesn't seem to be coming out.   My hair doesn't usually look greasy, and it would be really weird if it just started now.   I wondered if any body knew any thing that I could do to try and get it out of my hair?      And also, has this ever happened to anyone else and what did you do?      Thank you :)

20090205115410AArnVtu	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Any other girls think guys are OVERRATED?	For some reason I find men to be very overrated compare to women. Teen girls OBESSES the Jonas Brothers when honestly I find them extremely ugly, Nick and Kevin are just EW, I guess Joe is OK but when they first became famous Joe was the ugliest but overall girls have there posters all over there bedroom walls!!! guys don't have posters of girls up UNLESS they're naked. girls actually take care of them selfs and groom.. we pluck our eyebrows, we don't have body hair, we don't have facial hair, we have curves, we have long hair, generally we're the better looking sex. and I noticed that a lot of guys look plain, because most of them have the same short hair.. but girls overrate guys WAY too much, honestly. like sometimes I see such pretty girls with fat ugly hairy men.. and when a girl is a little over weight its a big deal but when a guy is fat nobody notices it. people actually expect girls to be like stick thin or something. and some ugly fat hairy bald men expect sexy blonde girls.. it's like DREAM ON..      anybody else agree with me that men are way too overrated?

I am from southern Georgia, but I moved to Boston for school about 3 years ago. I was in the sun all the time in Georgia, in the summers and everything, and tanned very well and never noticed any freckling.        I had never used a tanning bed before, but it's so cold and dreary up here I decided to start going to a tanning salon. All of the sudden, I noticed a few freckles popping up around my hairline. What's going on? I'm not even in the tanning bed for that long! I'm confused -- I figured a day out in the sun would be way more likely to cause freckling than a few minutes in a tanning bed!      Does anyone know how to prevent this from happening?
