These three soul gems are at:<br>  <br>  Crayfish Cave, Zone 4 (Crayfish Steep), behind rock walls I, J, K.<br>  Nornal, Zone 2 (Nornal Ageasel), behind hidden door K.<br>  Squandered Mine, Zone 3 (Squandered Mine Wind Holes), behind rock wall G.<br>  <br>  Um, you can also find these soul gems randomly throughout the game, like in the mages guild halls (stolen gems will work)<br>  <br>  Then, talk to Melisande.

06df7be548fafbe99b9d683ebc91c586aa	Oblivion. It's completely f**uckin' amazing. You can do just about whatever the hell you want. Think of it as medieval Grand Theft Auto with more strategy and IMO more fun. Oh yeah and 100+ hours of gameplay. The 100 is bare minimum. Main quest = 20hrs  4 factions (+1 bonus available free to PS3 owners = 5) x 12hrs each = 60 hrs. 20 hrs + 60 hrs = 80 hrs. Dungeon looting and random side quest time = at least 180 hrs. 180 hrs + 80 hrs = 260 hrs. If you get GOTY edition (same price) you get the Shivering Isles. Another Main quest, two new towns, whole new sets of armor, assloads of new dungeons = about 100 hrs at least. So final (not counting Oblivion gate closing, dungeon re-runs or new characters) 360 hrs. You're welcome lol.|`|c3469736b9c4b2d479781f30acddd6eeaa	Call of Duty 4 or World at War (I prefer 4 but the online is great for either)<br>  <br>  Uncharted is a solid game<br>  <br>  Metal gear solid is supposed to be a greatest hits game soon, so might want to wait on that..<br>  <br>  Killzone 2 is out Feb 27th, should be good.<br>  <br>  Resident Evil 5 should be good too<br>  <br>  Rent Heavenly Sword, its good but short<br>  <br>  GTA IV is a good game too<br>  <br>  umm... thats about it?

qzwWVgWMaa	Game and other shops like that usually rip you off big time when it comes to trading in games. I was in the shop once when a guy handed in 4 PS3 games (all within a year old) and was offered €14 for them. They are €70 each new. It's ridiculous. The prices are usually about the same fi you want to trade for something in store. Somethimes they do have offers like trade in 5 games (all from a selection of 10 specific ones) and get a new game free but even at that it's a bit of a rip off. They then sell your old games for €25 each.<br>  <br>  You'd be better off selling them on ebay or even just giving them to a friend, they're not worth much second hand.|`|DkA3xaHOaa	Far better off selling it on Ebay.

Something happens in the pond where whiscash lives directly up from town square and this evolution cave appears. Either you can't evolve your pokemon's level is too low or they need a certain item to evolve. Try checking your pokemons bio in the team menu and on one of the pages it says evolution and whether your pokemon can't evolve yet, can't evolve at all or if it's ready too.|`|uAMUG0xaaa	Beat rayquaza, save the world, and continue playing and you will go into<br>  a completely different storyline, ending with gengar -spoiler filter-.<br>  When you first start the second storyline, a new cave will open where<br>  wishcash usually sits. When you get any pokemon (you, your partner,<br>  or the other pokemon that do thing with you) to a high enough level, go into the cave, and your pokemon will evolve. Another cool feature is that you get to choose which pokemon you play as. Example: you started<br>  the game as pikachu, and your chosen partner is charmander. When you<br>  get to this point, you can be charmander, then be pikachu whenever you want.|`|n5mbcJQuaa	Just like pokemon red first finish the game and go to whiscash pond and you so a cave then you're gonna find wailord (he's whiscash) he's gonna say (i dind't not memorize it because i dont have that game only red but need rescue) theres a stone in the cave i think?<br>  <br>  then you're gonna go there then evole (I think there are floors and i need rescue I forgot the code|`|AtVIezr6aa	you need to beat the whole game(beat rayquaza)<br>  <br>  and then do a couple missions then were wishcash is/was there will be a hole and if you go in there by yourself (feature after u beat game)<br>  and if your the right level and have the requirment you can evolve|`|NJgunXVOaa	Finish the game i think. i already have a charizard and blastiose

7IfyFXT3aa	Don't bother with Guitar Hero - buy Rockband (1 or 2), or if you're going to buy Guitar Hero, buy the "world tour" edition.    All the latest versions are backwards compatible (so you can later buy the dics for the older games), but you want the latest instruments, and more importantly, you want the versions (RB 1 and 2, GH 4) that have the additional instruments (drums and mic).      Depending on your budget, I would buy (in this order): Game (+1 guitar), 2nd guitar, mic, drums.  Having the full band is amazing, and will allow your daughter to have a few friends over to play.|`|uKrdjrJiaa	I agree with the above answer-rock band has kept my 10 year old daughter and friends amused for hours.Another good one if u have an x box is Im in the movies or Lips|`|4QYU0FJNaa	Hmm, not sure I agree with the above, I would just get Guitar Hero 3, which comes with one guitar, and buy an extra guitar for it separately for 2-player.    I have heard from a few people that the whole band function on World Tour is not that good, and the World Tour game is pretty much the same as all the previous games except it comes with a mic and drums which you pay about an extra 100 for.

47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	no.  its just a great big scam to get your email listed on a bunch of websites that send you spam mail|`|rBWm8pPuaa	No lol not unless you do what you want, they give you the PSP but need to fill out a bunch of forms|`|6difexIJaa	In personal experience, no.<br>  <br>  I wanted to test this out.  So a while ago I made a fake email (you WILL get LOTS of spam) I signed up for a "free ipod".  That redirected me to a site that listed a bunch of companies trying to get me to try their products or services for a cost.  You sign up for a set amount of these services (which spam you more later on) and you eventually get to more services.  Sooner or later I came to the bitter end.  I "lost" the ipod, but I was given a cheap book and some coupons.|`|E8gMdvoaaa	ya, but its spams. you get it if you fill out forms, but you have to buy other stuff. they make you buy stuff, and personal information|`|HKHytNNQaa	yes you can win,<br>  I won 3 times, <br>  Try this <a href="http://www.catchopportunity.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.catchopportunity.com</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|QroOULvPaa	only some site are legit. like this one.<br>  xbox live cards & points 4 free<br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cdq6a9" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/cdq6a9</a>

wcgm8Z4uaa	if your willing to pay the $15/mo. than get WoW. Its NOT the same thing over and over again. TRUST ME. i would think the sims is fun ,but can get old QUICK. Ive played spore, i thought i would love it...i didnt.|`|wfzgcOHYaa	sims 3 spore gets boring after a while a wowc is for nerds and geeks|`|94zGdzm3aa	I play both Sims (3 isn't out until like, June 2nd or something) and WoW...I love both! <br>  <br>  Sims is a 1 time buy though...it can get boring unless you have some download sites to browse to keep it 'fresh' and WoW is a fun, very social game and you never do the same exact thing twice, so don't listen to the 1st noob.|`|yk0a1sWHaa	i have never played sims 3 but i love the sims 2 so i think you should get that i don't know what spore and world of warcraft is but it sounds dumb so my suggestion is sims 3|`|aCiW36l8aa	i think the sims3 you can create your own ppl and controll them reproduce and much more imagine yourself all grown up in that game if your not grown up...lol|`|6C287vmdaa	GET SIMS 3!!! IT'S WHAT I'M GETTING 4 MY B'DAY|`|npLxPjfZaa	Sims 3 is WAY more fun and entertaining!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... idk what spore is and world of warcraft is the same thing over and over again!|`|McVl1LWJaa	Sims 3 is MEAN and spore rocks. you have to pay per month with WoW
O928WT4Taa	You must use 0 and Enter on the numberpad side of the keyboard! I think 4 and 6 on the number pad will work also. Do you have any buttons on your joystick? If so, you can programme them to rudder left and right!
nGYqrKPTaa	No, because there would not be a dark mon. in grave for ssing.<br>  <br>  Edit- It would just slow the deck even more. And I know that you won't always get d-fissure and macro, but you'll usually get it not to long after the duel starts.|`|QzD3rJtMaa	First of all, don't add Dark Horus as it sucks.  I think you should add Dark Nephthys.  However, only add Dark Nephthys if you add 2 or 3 DDR - Different Dimension Reincarnation.  This way if he gets removed, you can still Special Summon him and still get to destroy Spells and Traps.
lONG10uLaa	Why do you fail at spelling, capitalization, and punctuation? Get off your video games for a while, and study grammar.
iJvpuk3taa	They are pretty straight forward,You will need to practice offline until you feel comforteble.I switch to a track ball mouse a year ago playing COD 4.Ill never go back,movements are more fluid and faster.Natural like my own,not jerky.  Going on the Internet is no problem,its pretty easy. Its a fast hard core game,Alot more gore than the earlier games but the game play is fantastic.The graphics will blow your mind|`|vbcEmGqpaa	dude play more then you'll catch the controls I've played for a month only but i can play on veterinarian and survive
d9405VB1aa	What do you mean
xFAzk9j8aa	You go to the chest where you get the barrows and dragon gloves. You can also go to www.runehq.com for help on quest.|`|ObNA2sWNaa	Go to the chest and where you get the other glove you will have to read the quest.
d9405VB1aa	NO, NO, NO NEED FOR INTERNET    JUST SIMPLY INSTALL IT|`|mNi7KeRkaa	You'll only need internet if you are wanting to play against other managers online, but no-one ever does that! If you just want to play on your own, you don't need internet.
VTGrUZbOaa	try Philippines, It would be a greater unique experience!    I gurantee you with that! :)
IcEQcIWbaa	Sorry Buddy but All Psp models don't support SD card.  Only Memory Stick PRO Duo card is supported by the handheld console!  I mean the card slot is only for Memory Stick PRO Duo.    Hope u understand.  Peace!|`|FhXE8r1Faa	No, it won't work. It's because it doesn't say "Memory Stick Duo", or "Memory Stick PRO Duo". If you want to order an MS online, here's a link to a good priced 8GB memory stick.    http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sk...    That's all I got.    Good Luck!|`|cHqeaVZcaa	no its to small

But I am fond of granny squares. They work up so quickly and look spiffy. Plus, there are so many different versions that look great as a sampler afghan. <br>  <br>  And hats. Hats are easy and fun and something I like to wear.|`|MtikeJtRaa	I have crocheted a variety of things, but I mostly crochet afghans.  If I don't have someone to give them to, I donate them to the local children's hospital.|`|jjDZJmfpaa	I like to crochet baby blankets. I have crocheted larger pieces but the baby size I can finish faster and feel rather accomplished. I also crochet dish and face towels. I am working on doilies and other garments. I think coin purse will be next.|`|pUupRT4saa	Hi, everyone I love to make cat & dog leashes,baby booties,baby pacifier clip & more.

zubObcZraa	It's not worth it. yes, the 360 has a great online service and a very good library of games, but with all it's hardware failure issues, you'll end up sending it in for repairs, wishing you bought a playstation 3 or nintendo wii instead. take my word for it. i've had mine since last december and had nothing but problems with it. i've sent it in for repairs, and they gave me another 360, which ended up freezing with any game i put in it. don't get an xbox 360!!!|`|wKCMMPo2aa	360's are fine, but I'd perfer a Playstation 3 more. Xbox live is not necessarily "good" PSN and XBOX live are the same thing. Go ahead, buy it. But I'd save my money for MAG, inFamous, and FF13 Versus.<br>  <br>  Also, to the people saying that the 360 has the top-notch graphics, LOL, I have two words for you: Killzone 2.|`|sbAtOGREaa	def stay with a ps3....you have to buy wireless adapter for xnox which is like 100 bucks|`|DyB8Nr1eaa	Go with what you enjoy to play. And paying for Xbox live can be just a one time thing, you can get the prepaid cards at like...wal-mart or target for like 50$ for 12 months +1 so 13 months.|`|ApRVrgCbaa	answer<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Anl671j_WescP3TZo41GyQ7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090424185301AAFhOpL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|jeKyuDWDaa	stick with ps3<br>  its full potential has on its way-plus it can do way more stuff<br>  the xbox is done-there will be nothing new or exciting-just games on it|`|KVipGWNcaa	yyyyyeeesssssssssss because when u get one it brakes down and it takes 3 months 2 get back 2gether and it smells worse than an old sumo wrestlers FART|`|uNgw6F8vaa	definitely a PS3|`|D865ZwmAaa	PS3 all the way and plus Xbox is probley gunna come out with another Xbox soon so u would run out of games quickley|`|otdwuRgnaa	Of course get the best of both worlds.|`|TwXVmXWdaa	keep the ps3, everyone i know who has a 360 and has played a ps3 agrees that ps3s are better|`|rsi3hzmdaa	360|`|nVUtKWXVaa	Go for it...it has fun games that aren't for the ps3 if you already have one.|`|BgKaN7P0aa	dude get an xbox 360 way better !!!!!!!|`|z1I7iAQBaa	yes u should buy it|`|Ok9xWKqraa	Let me lay it out for you. PS3 comes with EVERYTHING, but the Xbox is customizable, you can buy what you want and only what you want. PS3's are pretty reliable, and lately Xbox has been quite shaky. PS3 comes with Blue Ray, but if you don't intend on buying Blue Ray movies, it's a waste. The real difference is the online, PS3 ails in comparison to XBOX LIVE and LIVE is now $39.99 for 12 months instead of the usual $49.99, there are around 2 million LIVE members and after you beat a games campaign you usually play online with friends or with a very large gaming community, which is an essential for gaming. Now for the PS3 online I don't know to much about, I know it free but I don't believe it has as many members.<br>  <br>         I own an XBOX, I've gone through at least three of them, yet I still love em'. But the main reason you should buy an XBOX is they have the Legendary three, Gears of War 1&2, Call of Duty 4&5, and of course HALO 3.|`|bkkhrZQsaa	An XBOX360 has some of the best graphics in the world of Video games. It is great for games such as Halo and XBOX Live I personally think that your crazy to not have bought it already! I think it's one of te best systems I have ever played and think you would be more then happy with it.
ObNA2sWNaa	you should get a whip obby shield and get enof money to get a sara sword.|`|qLaw1VELaa	bronze scimmy    or a whip (kinky)    or an armadyl godsword    or try a bronze spear    the training sword is amazin|`|Xz4y4oNwaa	your life back
qeu6vWCHaa	It doesn't sound like it's a router issue to me, but it's a possibility.    If you really are dead set on finding a good router you should go here:    http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/support/xbox/l...    There is a lit of compatible routers, with make and model. Those are certified and approved routers tested by Xbox themselves.    Best of luck.|`|5c46dcbb7205da275e2dc4490158184aaa	Linksys Wireless Router    If you have a modem linked to that, even better.    I hooked mine together..  And plugged XBL into the wireless one..    I can go on the real internet and play Live at the same time..  Which a lot of people can't!|`|IMjaLrHaaa	Bt home hub is one of the official xbox live routers and there are many more which can b found at www.xbox.com/support but bt arent a very good internet provider i would suggest virgin broadband|`|5NitHFxKaa	i got one from verizon for like $60 its really good.  R u playing with an ethernet cord or wireless?|`|4FTRLSwiaa	the best way is to sell your xbox then buy a ps3 then enjoy and you would of saved about 200pounds for blue ray and wireless adaptor|`|ZsnelFnkaa	well just direct connect ur ethernet cable to the 360 to the router then u will have full connection, dont go wireless or ur conncection will sometimes suck|`|YIWkhKGTaa	Dsl isn't the best internet for online gaming if its an option I would go with cable internet.  But dsl will work.  I suggest using the microsoft brand wireless adapter on the xbox (50 bucks on ebay) and I would use a linksys router.
53sVKcOeaa	Steam won't stop anyone registering a game twice it can't read the registration details as they arn't accessible outside the game. If you sell it on the other user will be able to use it to however they may not be able to get online if you kept it and had a no cd patch and was online when they tried to go online.|`|WAOkgdj6aa	No, it's not possible. When a guy is bought from Steam, it stays on your steam account. Steam games are not transferable. You can buy people games and gift them to accounts as brand new, but once you have the game on your own account, it is not transferable... even if you uninstall it from your computer.. Steam justs shows the game as "uninstalled".<br>  <br>  The only way you could do it is if the person whom you are buying it from, is giving you their account. But you have to be logged in to their account every time you want to play.<br>  <br>  -edit- don't listen to the guy above me. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I've been using Steam for years.
5b27e93596092617fa2e4f390a524b89aa	pray at chapel, or get cure disease ingrediant or get cure disease spell.|`|AA11036328	Its a simple disease.<br>  <br>  Use a cure disease potion, spell, or go to the Chapel of Akatosh.|`|de806d892f488d2e107b2a8309ac7276aa	Try:<br>  <br>  1) Cure disease potion<br>  <br>  2) Cure disease spell<br>  <br>  3) If you fame is higher than your infamy, go to the chapel and to the large shrine in the middle and press the A button.
FPsMtmThaa	Pretty, Ugly, Handsome, funny, hot, whatever.. what matters most is you, your positive attitude and your desire to do what you want to do in life.  If this is your dream then no one can stop you! <br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and watch TV or a movie tonight and count all the "ugly" and "hot" people.  I bet you'll find, depending on your definition of ugly and hot, there is a mix of both.<br>  <br>  Just look at Owen Wilsons nose. Not the best nose a man can ask for right?. But do people consider him ugly?  Not really.  Sure his nose is ridiculous but what does he do? He uses it to his advantage. That's what he is known for. But now after being in so many movies, people don't talk about his crooked nose, they talk about how funny he is. If you're an ugly guy, your confidence you exude to others completely covers the fact that someone would perceive you to be "ugly." If you have a good heart, positive attitude, and the confidence in life.. people, especially girls, will take notice and will understand who you are as a person inside. trust me, girls are VERY attracted to confidence. Doesn't matter what you look like.<br>  <br>  I'm trying to help you out here.  Not sure if I'm doing a good job but look.. we ALL go through an ugly phase. It's called puberty and it sounds like you're going through the process.  You have many years to grow and your face will change with it.  I wouldn't worry about it too much man. It will get better.|`|YIWSXFXXaa	well... I know you didn't want me to say this but, what does your heart tell you?<br>  <br>  I know that sounds cheesy!!!

0PT9sdm1aa	You can use WASD or the mouse to move at any time you choose.  You have to specifically change the keys if you don't want WASD to move you.  It works that way in all versions of Guild Wars.<br>  <br>  As for the 3rd person, you can also use the mouse to zoom in or out; you can do things first person if you choose, or you can zoom out to a third person view.|`|NPQ17XfHaa	Both WASD and arrows are default in all the Guild Wars games, including the expansion, as is clicking with the mouse. And yes, after you buy it, it is free to play. It is third-person, unless you zoom all the way in, in which case it becomes first-person (which is really only good for looking at things in this game).|`|5p3ygCI8aa	You can use the WASD keys or the mouse.  The mouse is used for clicking on NPC's to talk to them, but you can do almost anything in the game using hot keys,
OUXO6g6Laa	The only thing that's supposed to brick your DS is a very cheap cart that causes an electrical short.  I wouldn't worry about this.  Updating a fake R4 with new R4 firmware is supposed to brick the fake cart and maybe the memory card, but not the DS.  Go to the R4DS website if you want up to date fake information.|`|WAOkgdj6aa	R4's are illegal. Please do not post questions about illegal product.|`|0jkuZYkkaa	R4's are unstable at best. Sometimes they don't work, sometimes they do crash your DS. I personally use one, and its worked fine for me. Occasionally it freezes up or goes fuzzy but after turning it off and off a few times the DS works again. But sorry, I've never heard of a fake R4. They are kind of illigit things to have anyway. My advice is to see the R4 in action before buying it. Bring your DS to the transaction and test it out for a few minutes. If the seller will let you even ask for a couple days to test it out before buying. That's my best advice, sorry I don't know how to spot the fakes. Try wikipedia or google or ask or something.

y02PZj22aa	Have you thought about using I-cord over 5 or 6 stitches?  I-cord makes excellent handles with minimum stretch.<br>  <br>  For instructions and a video:  <a href="http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/knitting-tips" rel="nofollow">http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/knitt...</a> and scroll down to I-cord.|`|AA12177717	Any knitting is going to stretch, even if you felt it, under stress and the weight of the contents will stress it.  However, if you knit a handle with any of your stitches of choice, my advice would be to line it with fabric, which, unless your bag is felted, is a good idea for the bag, too.  The linings will keep things from stretching out of shape and keep the contents from poking out the sides of the bag.  They don't have to be fancy fabrics and it doesn't take a machine to put them in, simply slip stitch an appropriate sized rectangle bag to the inside and a strip wide enough  and long for the strap, with about a half inch extra on each side to fold in.  Your handle, btw, might just be a good sampler for all of the stitches you mention (except stockinette because it won't lie flat).|`|M9FQSKRwaa	i would say that seed or moss stitch wouldnt stretch much<br>  <br>  seed stitch<br>  Row 1 (RS) K1, *p1, k1; rep from * to end. Rep row 1. <br>  Row 2: purl the knit and knit the purl<br>  <br>  MOSS STITCH<br>  Rows 1 and 2: * K1, p1, rep from * across.<br>  Rows 3 and 4: * P1, k1, rep from * across.<br>  Rep these 4 rows for Moss St.|`|3apkkyPJaa	i think your best bet would be seed/moss stitch. (they're the same thing)<br>  <br>  if you want it thicker and/or unstretchier, try knitting in seed/moss with two strands held at the same time. you could use one strand of grey and one strand of purple, and make a kind of variegated new yarn.|`|28wl5rfVaa	I knitted a bag and I agree with the person who suggested the i-chord especially of you're not going to felt it. It will reduce the chance for stretching too much, it's easy and it works so well!

wBWaYcInaa	noooo. why did you knocked ho-oh out? once you encounter it and knock it out, there is NO way you can encounter it again because well, that's the way it is. a legendary pokemon like lugia and ho-oh can only be seen once in this game. so, die once you'll never see it again.<br>  <br>  unless you saved the part where you were on your way to meet ho-oh, sorry. you might want the 2nd option; get a help from your friend. if you haven't catch lugia yet, you might want to save your game before you encounter it and take lots of the strongest pokeball you have. or if you have any masterball, use it because you don't need to worry. and lugia's lvl is 70, you know what to do.|`|3Rm5ZiW1aa	If you've already fought him and beat him, then no, you can't try to catch him again. That's why it's wise to always save right before a legendary battle, since you'll only get to fight them once unless they're Latios/Latias, and the legendary dogs (Suicune, Entei, Raikou).|`|7TBhuJfdaa	Sorry, but legendarys (Entei, Suicine, Raikou, Ho-oh, Lugia, etc) disappear if you defeat them.<br>  <br>  If you really wanted it you could start again or get your friend to trade a Ho-oh to you (they could also clone it so you both have one).|`|5sOyWUs1aa	you cant. just like all the other legendary pokemon, you only get one chance to catch it. try action replay to get it again.|`|Qi3kJmZLaa	there isn't a way to recapture legendaries after you knocked them out. unless you saved before fighting him, ask your friend to trade it to you or use action replay
ozK2hKJZaa	Wrong section, it is supposed to be in the travel section, but the economic needs of Iraq are very tricky because they keep on putting on wars. The needs are stop fighting in Iraq, planting new trees and grass there because it looks brown there, and helping the other people in Iraq instead of fighting. Just like the news reporters, they don't fight with them to speak with them. It depends on the public about the economics. The people there can make rules for themselves. The economics there are also marginal, everything is brown there and they are still fighting.

L2S9jjdLaa	Playing roulette online will give you a better chance as there is a lot more choice of roulette games with much lower house edges than American roulette (0, 00) that has the high 5.2% house edge with 38 numbers.<br>  <br>  Microgaming a large online casino software provider has the game French Roulette with a special rule called La Partage. Under this rule, if you make an even-money bet and the roulette ball lands on 0, you lose only half your bet instead of your entire bet. This lowers the 2.7% house edge to 1.4%.<br>  <br>  Betfair roulette has a Zero house edge. 0% by removing the zero's from the wheel leaving 36 numbers only.<br>  <br>  Is there a secret to winning roulette? As with any gambling game you need to nurture discipline and use a strategy. When you are up you stop and withdraw your winnings, greed is the downfall of players especially with roulette and the enticing 35:1 straight up numbers bet.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	No, no secrets to winning at roulette, just betting systems that don't work, but look as if they might to somebody who doesn't know anything about probability.<br>  <br>  Other guy explained it pretty well about the 5.26% house advantage.<br>  <br>  You can beat roulette by cheating, some ways to cheat it....<br>  <br>  ---Wheel timing computers that can predict where within an accuracy of ~10 spaces the ball will land by clocking how fast its spinning around the wheel, and how fast the wheel is spinning. Its totally high tech, totally real, and its totally illegal, it does work though.<br>  ---Creating wheel bias, by modifying the wheel, or making it crooked, you really cant do this without getting caught, it becomes very obvious<br>  ---Detecting wheel bias, while this isn't really cheating, its simply taking advantage of a defective wheel, it can work, however your just not going to find any defective wheels, the casinos know how to detect it also, and they will detect it before you do, and repair the wheel long before you even get to place a bet on it.  You simply wont find ANY crooked wheels in a modern casino.<br>  <br>  That's all i got, just don't play the game, you will lose money.|`|crhJLuw5aa	Roulette is nothing more than a game of chance. For American roulette(double zero), the house has a  5.26% advantage over the player. What this means is that if you were to play $1 at a time, after many, many spins (the long run); you will probably lose about 5.26% of ALL the<br>  money you've bet. <br>  <br>  In other words, if you play for a month and bet $1 for 10,000 spins of the wheel, you'll probably be about $526 behind.<br>  <br>  That said, there ARE professionals who DO win at roulette, but their techniques usually involve cheating. They usually get caught eventually. The punishment is extremely harsh. Nevada's prisons are full of these people.

5p3ygCI8aa	Try using an ability that will make it go to sleep, and then a quick ball, or an ultra ball.

Have him buy it for max price, he sells it to you for the average price in a trade, you sell it at near max price.

gY84lr2taa	with emulators you don't save the game like you would on the gameboy. You go to file and click save. Then when you want to open your game- load up the game as if you never played it before, then once the song starts, go to file again and click Load. It'll open the folder you saved them in. Find your save game and it'll open|`|9FypqzHkaa	Some early version of the Fire Red cannot be saved, you can only save it by using the save game feature in the visualboy advance, but it isn't really a save, it just copy the current state of your game. In a simple word, you must be able to save within the game in order to continue the game after beating the elite four.

It can be sold at a higher price if the game is new, if it comes with other games or a game system, or if it includes added features in the game itself. Honestly though, for an old, somewhat out-of-use game, it can fetch a pretty penny (but maybe not ￡40+! [who would buy something like that?!?]).|`|NNriYavJaa	probably for a colecter a lot but for ebay 10-20 bucks....|`|9t8xJkgqaa	it is worth around $15-$25

U9sV2NcOaa	To start out with?<br>  <br>  Definitely Castlevania: Symphony of the Night hands down. This game made a huge turning point in the Castlevania series and it's on the playstation 1 (or on the PSP if you unlocked it, but that's including an entirely different Castlevania >_>). <br>  <br>  In this game, you control a half human/vampire named Alucard, who wants to stop Dracula from being revived and destroy his castle. However, he realizes that he's already in the process of being revived and that someone assumed control of the castle's power while this is happening (shocking at who it is O.O).  <br>  <br>  But, in all seriousness, if this would be your frist Castlevania game, start with Symphony of the Night for the playstation one. Great graphics, music, characters, and voices (eh...Not Shaft's actor though..) for it's time!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: TMitch, if you suggest Dawn of Sorrow, I would think he or she would need to play Aria of Sorrow FIRST, since that's the prequel. Otherwise, he or she wouldn't understand why Soma has the ability he has and why Julius wants him to stay away from the cult.|`|BDlDYPxOaa	You need to start the best one ever, Symphony of the night on ps1, or Dawn of Sorrow, or if you own a NES Simon's quest is fun but it's unbelieveable how hard it is|`|1hNyVKdAaa	you should start in the beginging, with an old nes system.
zKCgyHoUaa	Try downloading the Questhelper mod from curse.com.   Download the curse client first, then the questhelper mod from the list.

When you're done using it you should re-enter the cheat but instead of typing true at the end type false. This unactivates the cheat.<br>  <br>  More cheats if you want.<br>  <a href="http://www.cheatscenter.com/Cheat-Code/The_Sims_2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheatscenter.com/Cheat-Code/T...</a>|`|JAicBUHAaa	There is one, but you need to be sort of careful.  Type in the boolprop code (boolprop testingcheatsenabled true) and then shift click the mail box.  Shift click, and choose "Make friends for me."  Then you should have made friends with about 16 people.  They will not show up when you look for the little icons of friends, but they will show up under the job part.  <br>  <br>  Do not ever click debug mode when using boolprop.

E2FALlxraa	The system need's a memory stick. A 1GB memory stick is a good size to have. To plug your psp into the computer. First go to your psp, go to the settings page on the XMB and go to system settings. Then go to format the stick. This will put the correct folders you will need on your psp. then plug your psp into usb. Then go into USB mode. A popup should come up asking how you want to open it up. Go to "open folder to view files" Then the rest is pretty much self explainitory. Just drag the files into the folders. like if its a music file put it into the MUSIC folder. Now for running emulators you will need custom firmware. To get custom firmware you will need to make or buy a pandora's battery. Just google pandora's battery for more information.

The Disneyland encyclopedia has every ride, land, shop, restaurant and even people that have to do with Disneyland it will tell you everything and more. 101 things has secrets about rides and such that you may or may not know already. The hidden mickeys book will allow you to find the hidden mickeys in Disneyland and more there is even a web site that has even more that people find. <br>  <br>  What is nice is that if you have a library close then I would say to go there and see if they have these books that way you don't have to pay for allot of books you can decide which ones you may like best, our library has all of these books so it was nice to look at them before purchasing them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and enjoy!  *Jena|`|dhdz5uNSaa	I personally love THIS book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disneyland-Encyclopedia-Unofficial-Unauthorized-Unprecedented/dp/1595800336/ref=pd_sim_b_2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Disneyland-Encyclo...</a>|`|06a307f2aff20982eb063d66675040fcaa	You might like to read Mouse Tales and More Mouse Tales.

b46cdd1aa4bbf7a0605077b3b98e38b4aa	The Call of Duty 4/5 series is great for addictive play, Far Cry 2 is a beautiful game with lots of action, online kinda bites. I played Heavenly Sword found it less than Heavenly...It sucked to tell the truth. Grand theft 4 was ok but it was too easy. And online action is crappy. I liked Tom Clancy's End War but it was near impossible to find an online game.|`|X92FdfPeaa	The best game for you would probably be Metal Gear Solid 4. Its a stealth action game where u can basically kill a guy in 100 diffrent ways. Its awesome. It also involves shooting and the graphics are head on. And its on ps3!|`|58a280b909e38ffa527544e0e898256eaa	i don,t know if this will be of any help but try warhawk or medal of honor airborne  .|`|equzW2uvaa	gears of war is so fun try it|`|quYLRIrgaa	Killzone 2 is out next week!|`|MOjoa7Uqaa	buy more games.

O1nUSQ8Baa	Just because I like god of war, I have to give that choice my vote. I haven't played the DBZ games, but the gameplay mixed with the graphics and difficulty ranges in God of War make it worth it to buy that game. Of course, at this point, you can probably get a version used, which makes it cheaper.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ACG8cTpLaa	get god of war its hella fun

rgHnAPhAaa	I've played it. I didn't get scared at first since I've heard of it before and seen the reaction videos. I did it on my friend at a party once. Once he got towards the end, he jumped out of seat screaming and pushed me off mine for scaring him. It was classic. I had my camera, but didn't record it.|`|T0laSJ5Eaa	huh

You got screwed over.<br>  There is no way to gain Runescape gold besides earning it the hard way on Runescape itself.<br>  However, if the website had a Terms and Conditions area, read them.<br>  If it says it promised Runescape gold, then you could sue them.<br>  But JaGeX could probably sue you too, for trying to hack their game.<br>  <br>  Anyways. I have a feeling you won't get gold, and won't get banned.<br>  If you do get the gold, and do get banned.. then I have no more advice for you.<br>  If you find Runescape too hard, don't play it.<br>  <br>  - Best wishes, Ben.|`|7045569549a16a88ad40754be0b4a6f3aa	You cry...

When downloading albums/songs click 'Run' and it'll show up in uTorrent, which is where you can tick songs you want. It'll take some getting used to, but it is so easy. Sometimes it takes a while to download, but it all depends on how long your computer has been running during the day, so just be patient. Right click on the album when you've decided what songs you want, click on 'Bandwidth Allocation' and set it to 'High' to help songs go faster.

CSiFGHcGaa	A few variables/ possibilities: <br>  <br>  1. You turned off the console before you saved or you forgot to save. <br>  <br>  2. You deleted memory on the 360 without knowing it. <br>  <br>  3. You did not have enough room to save memory. <br>  <br>  4. The 360 maybe had a technical problem. <br>  <br>  That happened with my friend when we were playing Gears of War 2. We had to start the last level all over again.

f9soMMuiaa	If you can play Sims 2 ok, likely you can run Sims 3 as well. As long as your computer is purchased somewhere 2004 and beyond. Sims games don't take much, unless you want tip top performance for Sims 3. But if your'e just going to play Sims 3, it won't be worth it to get a gaming computer.

2ndiCI2qaa	Do you mean an OS for your ds card? I mean operating system. I have r4 ds. I get my software from the r4 ds site. One thing you can try is formatting your micro sd card, then putting the ds real software back on. (make sure you save all system files to the root of the memory card) If this doesnt work Id say to send your card back. I had a similar problem with my DS ONE card (60$ card). It went into save saver mode and never came out of it. :( On the brighter side my new card the r4 ds revolution costs only 25 dollars (including shipping) and Ive never had a problem with it.

6difexIJaa	I would choose paladin.  Paladins can be protection and take a lot of hits with a shield on.  They have auras which do damage to attackers, so even though you lose health you can slowly, but surely take a lot of hits thereby killing a lot of mobs at once.  In pvp, ret paladins are nasty and teamed up with a death knight tear face.<br>  <br>  Hunters are nice for solo grinding, but they get very boring after a while.  Also, it seems they are weak lately.|`|E8gMdvoaaa	( PALADIN ) a Human Palidan. there is lot of paladins, and they can heal but a hunter has a pet, so it can kill faster but die quicker. paladins kill slower and die slower.|`|YQYMPGK3aa	hunter! <br>  <br>  its the quickest class to lvl in the game. also super fun to play, dps is fun for pve and competitive in pvp.<br>  <br>  alli = dwarf hunter<br>  horde = orc/troll

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi, There are many games in the total war series:<br>  <br>  * Shogun: Total War was released in 2000 - I've played it and it was absolutely pathetic.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  *Medieval: Total War was developed in 2002 - I personally haven't tried it yet, but I doubt there are any major improvements.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  *Rome: Total War was made in 2004: You have already played it though. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  *Medieval II: Total War was released in 2006. This game was AWESOME and has so many enhancements. Here's a list of what it provides:<br>  <br>  1. Religion has a significant role in managing your empire, controlling the public order and gaining good standing with the Pope. For example, if you were Spanish and you occupied Marrakesh, a city in North Africa, you would need to convert the population. Priests, bishops and cardinals can preach the word of god across these islamic lands and help reduce religious tension. By building chapels and upgrading them gradually, you will see an increase in Catholic worship and adoption of European cultural ideas. This is beneficial and necessary for you to win the game.<br>  <br>  2. If you're pious enough, you can request or join a Crusade through the Catholic Church. The objective here is to simply conquer a selected province. Your army marches twice as fast because of moral boost and a feeling religious importance. If successful, you will gain unit experience, riches and respect from the college of cardinals in return. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, Islamic empires can initiate Jihads to protect their sacred lands or forcefully remove Catholic enemies. They too, get the same benefits. <br>  <br>  3. Different units are introduced because of technological advances. You would've already expected this, but the introduction of new units accurately reflects the Middle Ages, and also makes for some fantastic battles. Gunpowder finds its way into conflicts, where cannons and arquebuses (primitive guns) are created and used. Siege works can be built, so that ballistas, trebuchets and catapults can be constructed. <br>  <br>  Additionally, some non-combat units make their debut. Merchants use trade resources on the map to generate income per turn. Princesses can marry other faction princes, or travel distant lands for diplomatic negotiations. As previously mentioned, Catholic priests and Muslim Iamams can be trained through their respective religious buildings. Inquisitors (special judges of the Catholic Church) roam Europe searching for evil individuals like heretics and witches. Speaking of heretics, you'll find them walking the map randomly from place to place, attempting to turn your peaceful Catholic society into a blasphemous one! Witches can approach characters like generals and kings, trying to remove traits and cause havoc.<br>  <br>  Overall, combat is more exciting and tense because of the constant discoveries and innovations being invented. <br>  <br>  4. The programming for computer battle tactics and diplomacy is better, but still not totally fool-proof. The campaign map is bigger including the "Americas", more of Scandinavia, Russia and the Middle-East. The graphics when fighting are greatly improved, along with campaign map, which is more detailed. Two new types of cities can be built. Castles or normal towns. You'll need to adjust and choose which one is better based on their geographical location. Videos have also been made for assassination and espionage - which makes it a bit more enjoyable.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  * Finally, there is Empire: Total War, available from March the 4th 2009 (11 days time).<br>  <br>  1. It seems to be the best combination of turn-based and real time strategy gameplay yet. You re-create history in the 1700s era of colonization and imperialism, establishing settlements in the "new world", upgrading your technology and constructing necessary buildings to allow your population to live happily.. Real historical events also occur, keeping you up to date with what was going on in the world. As in the previous titles, religion and politics play a huge role in your expansion and self-preservation, but extra features have been added. It is also worth noting that religious ideologies and government affect diplomacy with foreign nations, and the stability of your faction.<br>  <br>  All units are accurately designed and implemented into Empire: Total War to provide you with a unique feeling of realism. The campaign map is also skillfully drawn from REAL satellite imagery. 3D naval battles have now been introduced, graphics refined and land conflicts adjusted for an optimal experience. Gentleman are used for encacting diplomacy (alliances, tribute payments etc) and Rakes can be used for espionage, plus assassination. Religion plays a role and of course, government types can be changed.<br>  <br>  2. It's even possible that up to 100 historical characters appear such as Napoleon Bonarprate, Charles XI of Sweden and George Washington.<br>  <br>  Use and take advantage of:<br>  <br>  - Artillery like cannons, landmines (primitive fuse wiring), grenadiers (iron ball with fuse-wire)<br>  <br>  - Gunpowder soldiers armed with muskets, pistols and bayonets, later better weaponry is invented.<br>  <br>  - Cavalry of all sorts, including elephants.<br>  <br>  - Different formations and cover systems to bring variety to unit choices.<br>  <br>  - Much more!<br>  <br>  <br>  3. 12 playable factions are available at the moment, and more are unlockable once you defeat them in your goals for domination and glory. So far, 11 have been confirmed.<br>  <br>  - Kingdom of Great Britain<br>  - Kingdom of Prussia<br>  - Kingdom of France<br>  - The Ottoman Empire<br>  - The Spanish Empire<br>  - Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth<br>  - United Provinces (Dutch)<br>  - Sweden<br>  - Russia<br>  - Marathas<br>  - Unknown?<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  The choice is yours. Good luck. I definitely recommend Medieval II or Empire.|`|npLxPjfZaa	call of duty<br>  halo 3<br>  halo<br>  halo 2<br>  mechassault<br>  <br>  OMG OMG OMG PLAY ASSASSIN'S CREED!

25a903128a710f9935672e9f69763d85aa	I am a costumer for 15 years. I have made many animal costumes out of sweatsuits. I would buy 2 pairs of pants and one hoodest sweatshirt. If you cannot get them in the color you need, buy a basic color like light grey or white ( I take mine home and rit dye them in my washing machine to the color I need - check package for directions for dyeing) <br>  The top is perfect as is... covers the head and has the pocket built in! Sweet! <br>  I would take the second pair of pants apart ( after dying and drying) I I would use one leg to fashion the kangaroo tail. If you safety pin it together ( basting) you can even pin it on ( the pants) before cutting it out. ( Do I make sense?) Follow the picture of the kangaroo for advice on how long and how wide the tail part should be. Please feel free to email me direct for questions ( katrina6666@yahoo.com)

obPSaYf3aa	I have two twisted fury solids that I use for different lane conditions.  One is sanded down with a rough surface for my PBA experience league and the other one has a high glossy surface for house and medium lane conditions.<br>  <br>  I've used both on house and short oil conditions, and both are like night and day.  The sanded one will go gutter to gutter with medium revolutions and about 16-17 mph.  The polished one will basically play the outside and center of the lane perfectly.  I have the RICO drilling pattern (pin in the palm) on both balls for excellent control on the lane while keeping their aggressive entry angle into the pocket without leaving many corner pins or solid 7-10's.<br>  <br>  So far with my Twisted Fury Solids, my sports condition (PBA experience) league average is about 207 and my house condition average is around 218.  Good luck!

6GIrW5eWaa	Here is the answer Downloadable content<br>  On February 10, 2009, Activision and Treyarch announced that downloadable content (DLC) was under development for World at War. The first installment of DLC will include four new multiplayer maps. Nightfire takes place in the ravaged streets of Berlin, Knee Deep involves several destructible Japanese fortifications, and Station consists of the damaged remnants of a U-Bahn (underground rapid transit system). The fourth map, titled Verrückt (German for crazy), is an addition to the Nacht der Untoten map on Nazi Zombies mode, and includes new weapons and power-ups intended to expand the experience. The DLC pack will be released in March 2009 for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 versions of the game.<br>  <br>  I hate you too but give me the 10 points :)|`|jxpV13rTaa	march. they havent said when yet (as far as i know)
vtJDHJDYaa	His name is Luxord. This fight will proceed a bit differently from other fights. Instead of HP, Luxord has a time meter at the top of the screen. Sora does too. The advantage lies with Luxord, however; Sora can still die by loss of HP. When the battle first begins, Sora is turned into dice Sora. At this point, all you can do is jump around. Don't try to hit Luxord, as you'll just end up hurting yourself on the cards. Just run away from him until Sora turns back (once the Drive Gauge reaches 0).<br>  <br>  Now that the battle's begun, it's time to keep an eye on your time gauge. Whoever runs out of time first will lose the battle, so technically, you can win if you have the slightest advantage at the end of the battle. It's best to try to get a buffer though, in case things go wrong later in the battle.<br>  <br>  Keeping your MP up is key during this battle, since Sora loses HP so fast. Attacking Luxord's cards will cause a lot of MP orbs to appear. Also, if you kept MP restorative items in your item slots, that will help as well. Although Luxord doesn't have an HP gauge, attacking him will cause his time gauge to lower slightly faster. This is important for later, when you are subjected to his games. In case you lose, you will have an easier time catching your time gauge up with Lux's.<br>  <br>  One of the games you'll see is a card game. Run up to him when he challenges you, and hit Triangle. Cards will spin around Sora, and the command menu will scroll many Xs and an O. This is exactly like the Gambler minigame; just wait until the scrolling O gets slow and hit X when it crosses the top command box. This will cause Luxord to lose a lot of time and release HP orbs. Losing will cause Sora to turn into a card. You can actually attack as a card, but it's still not recommended.<br>  <br>  When Luxord turns into a card, you'll have to pick him out amongst a series of other cards flying around the area. You'll want to try to be as accurate as possible. Use Flip to turn the cards around. Flipping a blank card (turn the camera to see what's on the other side of the cards) won't do anything, but flipping one with a clock on the back will cause you to lose time, and the ones with the balls of fire on the back will hurt you.<br>  When Luxord's time is almost out, he'll litter the floor with dozens of cards. At this point, he'll teleport around and start slicing at you with cards viciously. You can run from these attacks fairly easily (especially if you have any of the Drive Form abilities). After that, he'll appear at the far end of the area, and Sora runs after him automatically. A wall of huge cards appear around Sora, and you need to get four O commands on each box in the command menu to win this little game. The O commands scroll by much more often now, so don't be cautious about hitting X when you see O scroll by, since they come in clusters. When you've done the first box, scroll down to the second and repeat. Do the same for the third and fourth boxes (the fourth will be a little hard since you can't see the Os coming). If you win this little game, Sora takes the cards and flings them all at Luxord. This should take away most, if not all, of his remaining time. If you happen to lose this one, Sora will lose most of his time. Not a good thing, obviously.<br>  <br>  Once Luxord is out of time, attack him physically to defeat him.|`|PTovC2Dqaa	The guy you're talking about is Luxord from Organization XIII. His special power is Time and gambling with cards and dice.<br>  <br>  The battle against Luxord brings something new to the table. Rather than attacking an enemy's HP, this battle is fought against Time. Both Sora and Luxord have bars that represent time. Whoever's Time bar is emptied first loses. Unfortunatley, this doesn't prevent Sora from dying if his HP reaches zero.<br>  <br>  This battle is a mind game than one aspect. Being a gambler, Luxord is interested in changing Sora into a card and a die. Magic and Items are unusable during these forms. There isn't really anything to respond to being shape-changed; just bounce or glide up to him and attack to apply pressure. This keeps him from using too much damage on Sora when you can't heal.<br>  <br>  Watch for an opportunity to flip the cards with the Flip Reaction Command while focusing your attacks on Luxord. Watch for him to turn himself into a card. When this happens, keep track of Luxord's card as it is mixed with others. When the cards stand up, use the Flip Reaction Command on him.<br>  <br>  Toward the end of the battle, Luxord spreads cards around the floor. Jump around to dodge the cards he throws as he teleports around. If you have obtained the Final Form's Glide ability, use this to keep at a distance from him.<br>  <br>  During this fight you also get the opportunity to use the Begin Game Reaction Command, which turns the words in the command bar buttons to turn into Xs and Os. The idea is to press the button on an O as they rotate by to avoid being cursed and turned back into a die or card.<br>  <br>  For defeating Luxord, Sora gets a +5 HP boost and the SECRET ANSEM'S REPORT 9.|`|0FK7ERJ7aa	God his name is Luxord!!! Why cant you remember the Brit?!?!<br>  <br>  ...anyway...dont hit the cards with the big black swirly holes....they subtract time....the green cards i think slow time or add time...anyway...hit him until he go fadey....

wYcRdfXmaa	Open for business does not have any new creatures to turn your sim into. However, you can build servos (robots) that have needs and are basically the same as regular sims. If you want to actually turn your sims into creatures, you will need one of these expansions:<br>  <br>  University: if your sim dies, you can go to career rewards and use the resurrect thing (don't know what it's called exactly) and call the grim reaper. If you select the sim that has dies and give the grim reaper a small amount of money, your dead sim will come back to life as a zombie. Zombies are slow moving and have altered personalities as compared to what their personality was when they were normal. <br>  <br>  Nightlife: In nightlife, you can journey downtown during NIGHTTIME and find a vampire. If you become Friends with the vampire, you can be bit by them and be turned into a vampire. However, you can't go outside in daytime or else your sim will die.<br>  <br>  Open for Business: None. Only buildable servos<br>  <br>  Pets: While at home in the evening hours (7pm-7am) a dog with glowing yellow eyes may appear. If you make friends with this dog you can be bitten (or something) by him and you will turn into a werewolf. I don't know much about werewolfs into the sims 2 as I have never had one.<br>  <br>  Season: If you spray your plants enough you can turn into a plantsim. Plantsims have green skin and ugly hair that you can't change. They only have three needs: sunlight, water, and love (social). They can also asexually reproduce. <br>  <br>  Bon Voyage: Bon Voyage doesn't have any new creatures to turn your sims into. But if you ever find a map called "Hidden cabin" then you can visit a secret lot when vacationing at Three Lakes. Here you will find bigfoot! Bigfoot is very friendly and if you make friends with him, he can come to live when you when you return home.<br>  <br>  Apartment life: Apartment life has one of the best creatures ever. Witches! If you make friends with a witch (they wear pointy hats and tattered clothes in game) you can ask them to teach you the ways of the light or dark. Eventually, you will become a witch and you will be able to mix potions and put a variety of spells on other sims (good and bad). You can also summon a spectral cat! I'm not sure what the purpose of the spectral cat is, but you can only summon it if you have pets expansion.<br>  <br>  Woah ok I'm done.|`|qKM7rzTCaa	I've had this expansion pack for quite some time, and have never been able to turn them into creatures.  I've also never heard that this was possible.

08q4OGkGaa	m assuming your talkin bout fallout 3 and u just have to keep playing or do side quests to get you xp and until u get 25 explosive u cant disarm or explode it, but since exploding it or disarming it isnt a main quest you dont have to do it but just keep on with the storyline and when u finally get ur 25explosive teleport back to megaton disarm and just get back on with the storyline <br>  <br>  hope this helps =)|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Since you haven't said which game you're playing, it'd be difficult to help.|`|aR8GDOqVaa	welll u gotta drive the car to the pizza place nd then find  tank nd ask it to take you to covent gardens and wen u get there find the hobo on the rose garded|`|XnuW7Vsvaa	Well have u tried taking mentats? That helped me, but u might also wanna try to get any clothes that brings explosives up like the Blastmaster helmet|`|qza4S3Jnaa	I myself blew up the city, as I saw it as a much easier and fun method. But the easiest and quickest way is to use some mentats. Happy Gaming!!
e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	There's no set password for that door. It's been lost so sawys the mayor of little lamplight and joseph [I think thats the kids name]  You have to hack it.<br>  <br>  Just SAVE before hand.. you can either randomly click words than after 4 tries and failed.. you can reload [or after 3 log out and log on to make sure you dont get locked out].  Or get a pen and some paper and try to get a word with more than 4 letters correct and go from there.<br>  <br>  Incase you don't know how to hack properly.. the letters that are correct are in the RIGHT place.. so 3/4 words for TORN try WORN or HORN.  So just write out the word and try to find similar words with the amount of letters correct in the same place as the original word..<br>  <br>  Boy does that not makes sense? darnit <.<|`|jxpV13rTaa	the password? if your at the gate with the kids guarding it, you have to find the mayor and tell him you want to pass through the gate..he will try to convince you otherwise, but be persistant. he will agree to open it and start running towards the gate. follow him and it will open when you get there.
