AA11487579	No one serious believes that debt for it's own sake is good.<br>  <br>  But the things that debt indicates often are signs of a vibrant economy. If people have debt, that implies that they own important, durable goods like homes and automobiles. It also implies that the banking system is reasonably well-developed since it is confident enough to be handing out loans. Also, government debt actually allows the government to be more flexible with its policies, because if they have debt (usually in the form of things like treasury bills or savings bonds), they can buy back some of the t-bills or bonds, increasing the money supply. You don't need nearly as much debt as the US has to do this, but you need some.<br>  <br>  It's never good to look at how much debt a country has and use that to say it's weak or strong. By itself debt is generally a bad thing, and it's better to have less--but it just so happens that lots of people and countries with debt are able to get nicer things that in turn can spur growth.|`|5Snex2peaa	You have to look at the economy as an economic power game.<br>  <br>  I had a sales manager for XEROX tell me that he liked for his salesmen to be in debt because it made them hustle.

TluWzYAJaa	Perhaps the fact that she is growing emotionally closer to you is triggering some past emotions.  So in part it's fear and worry.  She is letting some of her guard down in this relationship with you and it's bringing back emtions that perhaps were buried.  Take this as a growth thing.  Just keep doing what you're doing and show her that she can trust you as a friend that would never hurt her.|`|2OU6UNW4aa	her head is just playing games with her. she has had abusive relationships in the past so her mind id making her think that every relationship will be this way, even though she doesnt feel this way. just reasure her that you would never hurt her and you guys will get through this together. eventually the dreams will stop
ruVqXadNaa	At some point in time you are going to have to associate with her, especially if you are doing a project with her. My advice would be to shake it off as best as you can and keep in mind that all the stuff she is doing won't get her far and will ot make her as successful as someone who works hard (sloppy work or not). Do the best you can to tolerate her and make it known that she must help with the project and that you will not do all the work. She needs to know that if she doesn't do her share of work the two of you will get a bad grade because you are not doing it all. However, don't give her more or less work than what is fair because if you give more she may be less inclined to do it and if you give her less she may believe she'll only have to do a little bit....<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps....|`|MOXa0tvOaa	You're always gonna meet people like that...It's best to just ignore it.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well it seems odd that you would even have to ask, but no, you don't need to be around anyone that gets on your nerves, or anyone who behaves in this manner.

YQOT68xFaa	Very important to me. I am a born again Christian, so it was important to me to marry another born-again Christian so we'd be plowing the same furrow in life. It isn't that I dislike people of other faiths, or atheists; I don't. It's just that we need to be in agreement about matters of faith, and that would not work out so well if I'd married an atheist or a Buddhist, or even someone like a Mormon or Catholic, because of a profound difference in beliefs.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  "I doubt I could have much of a relationship with a person that was always damning me to hell."<br>  Wow, way to assume there hun. Is this your estimation of Christians? I'm a Christian; I've been on this forum for months and months. Ever heard me damn someone to hell? And there are plenty of other Christians out there who don't do it either.<br>  <br>  "Sorry, I don't think things like french kissing or swearing are offenses worthy of eternal damnation"<br>  Guess what. Neither does the Bible. If you've ever read it, you'd know that.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I am an agnostic, so it is not important to me.  My husband is an atheist, but I wouldn't mind if he got religion, though it would surprise me somewhat.  However, if I was religious, I imagine it could be quite important to me.|`|yiHsLtPdaa	For me it would be the other way around. I could never be with a bible humper. Assuming I was interested in a relationship or marriage, the no belief in God would be a relief to me.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I could probably handle being with a guy who idly believed in some higher power and didn't make religion a major priority in his life. But I would prefer an agnostic or atheist.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Deep down it does matter to me. So, yes it's very important.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Well, I am open to hat the "truth" might be. I am non religious but spiritual. I do believe in God or other supreme being. I probably would nt have wanted to marry someone who wasn't on the same page as me.My  husband and I really enjoy taking about spiritual ideas and also I refer to God from time to time, I wouldn't want to be married to someone trying to talk out of my beliefs. On the same not, I wouldn't want to be with someone who was very religious of any sort, but spiritual is a must for me.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I am already married but I can tell you that believing in God was the most important thing to me.  We were not from the same religion but were both Christians.  We wanted children so I made sure that he was okay with the fact that they would be raised with my beliefs which he didn't object.  I'm a Catholic and two weeks before our wedding he surprised me by being baptized in the Catholic Church with my parents as his Godparents.  He had seen the Priest and did everything he had to do to become a Catholic without me knowing.  I'm sure that nobody ever had a greater gift than the one my husband gave me for our wedding.  We now go to Church as a family with our three wonderful children.  One of the most important thing in a marriage is the values you share.|`|PwvU3LQBaa	Not important.  Actually, I would prefer it if they weren't religious at all.  I am not so I don't want to be preached at all the time.  I am glad my husband is not religious, actually, I don't even know what he fully believes and he doesn't know what I fully believe either.  Religion doesn't come up with us, and that is the way I like it.  Neither one of us is Atheist, we are more Agnostic.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	Religious people are just going to have to deal with us agnostics/atheists standing shoulder to shoulder next to them, living with them and being neighbors and co-workers and fellow taxpayers and citizens, sending their children to the same schools, etc. It's just the way things are now. Agnostic/atheist people no longer have to hide that they are agnostic/atheist. Believe it or not, we prefer people who are more compatible with us, too.<br>  <br>  What is this supposed to mean?<br>  <br>  "I would never marry, or be in a serious<br>  relationship with somebody who is an Athiest. I think that would truly<br>  compromise my integrity as a man, and a human being."<br>  <br>  Get over yourself. I know that I am not compatible with a man who is theist but I don't go around saying that he would compromise my integrity as a woman or as a human being if I were to get involved with him. This is precisely the reason why I avoid dating theists. <br>  <br>  "But I am open<br>  to being a witness and telling them about The Lord. So it would be<br>  wrong for one to ignore, when that could be your chance to draw someone in. "<br>  <br>  Again, this is the reason why I avoid theists. It's very awkward to have someone try to sell their religion to you. It's very awkward to be close to someone who deep down, thinks you're going to burn in hell and that he/she has to save you from that.<br>  <br>  I'd rather just avoid it altogether and associate mostly with secularists, agnostics and atheists. I do have theist friends and even religious friends but I am not dating them or marrying them.|`|ZWePAEZUaa	However.  I love you all,  I really do.  Thank you kindly for answering<br>  an important question.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Not at all.

If he has one, I'd prefer he kept it to himself most of the time. I have never put much stock in mythology, other than for entertainment purposes.<br>  <br>  It's very important that he's of good character and we have similar morals and values, but I actually prefer if he not be all that religious because I don't want it to be an issue, and I really don't want to hear about all the time.

I don't want him to attempt to convert me every time we're together.<br>  <br>  That said, I don't exactly want a man who believes in absolutely nothing either. I might not believe in God or any of that but I still believe in something.<br>  <br>  If that makes any sense. =D|`|cf105WLxaa	It's more important to me that my boyfriend doesn't believe in god.

It's like a Hieronymus Bosch painting!!!<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry, I don't think things like french kissing or swearing are offenses worthy of eternal damnation, but then again I don't have my head thrust in some archaic book 24/7 either.|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	As an agnostic it would not matter to me at all. The only thing that would matter to me is that he respects all other religions and does not try to force me to change my beliefs. I don't care what religion people say they are; I care about the morals they live by. <br>  Out of interest can I ask; If you had to marry one would you rather marry an atheist who lives by the morals of the bible (i.e. follows the commandments, is kind and loving but does not believe there is a god) or a Christian who believes the bible speaks the truth but does not follow the commandments (i.e. believes the bible is the word of God but does not obey it)?<br>  I was just wondering because to me what people believe about the creation of the earth matters very little (there is no real conclusive evidence proving anything yet- even science leaves many unanswered questions) but instead I feel how people live their lives is important.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	Giving the word marriage and partnership respect is all I would really care about. I would want to be in love with that person and that person with me , because if he/she is in love with me , it would be easy for me to convert that person as well as convince them my religion isnt that bad at all. But all in all I dont care about color , so why religion? All I would want is for that person to respect my religion and not hate it unlike most obnoxious atheists blaming religious people for excluding them when they do that themselves.  I would want that person to be a understanding polite person too.

ZMQLV1t4aa	its true that the "truth hurts" but it doesn't kill! If you walk around telling the truth, it is true that you will hurt feelings in one way or another but they will not die lol. Neither emotionally or physically. I think that's an over dramatic statement. Truth hurts but so does lying. Just not right away. Truth hurts at the moment you say it, lying creeps up on you later when you least expect it. Their are ways to tell the truth but in a "kinder" way. I'd rather hear the truth then be lied to. Some times you have to stop worrying about others feelings SO MUCH. You can consider there feelings, but if you dance around them on egg shells so much, you'll find yourself lying about everything and who you are to please them.|`|urs7M4ITaa	Well there's honesty and there's brutal honesty. And with some people you can be brutally honest with them and know they will be alright about it and there are others who you would make cry. If you are worried about offending people too much then you have to learn to choose your audience if you know what I mean? The key is knowing who you can say what to. With the more sensitive people, if you really have to say something, you gotta' say it in the nicest possible way but with people, probably good friends who know you better, you can probably be more blatantly honest and have them take it the right way. But you have to be careful that you don't just insult people you know? Especially people who don't know you that well, won't know how you mean certain things. You might think you are just being honest and they might think you are insulting them. So my advice to you is to make sure that people understand what you mean when you say things and choose your audience carefully! All the best babe...|`|HeE9lqi5aa	so true. i have a big mouth too and i usually end up hurting people when i "SPEAK THE TRUTH". i guess the best solution is if we think before we speak. however, if u r a polite person and r very chivalrous then honesty doesnt hurt. people will welcome suggestions if u r polite. so try too give a big smile and talk to people. :D|`|MOXa0tvOaa	Yeah, honesty does kill.

Men taking synthetic testosterone can have very serious health ramifications including an increased chance of breast cancer.

OR if someone dies from improperly using efferdrine.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Connor, I disagree with your assessment of steroid users. "Steroids are for lazy guys who aren't man enough to build muscle on their own"<br>  If a person takes steroids, it doesn't mean that they can just sit there and grow muscles without still working their *** off.  Steroids do allow you to build more muscle because they allow you to work out at a much higher intensity. Scientifically speaking, this is not natural and could be considered cheating, but then why then aren't protein supplements, creatine and a balanced diet considered cheating as well?<br>  <br>  Just something to ponder.  There are health risks to taking steroids/testosterone, but mainly because it is often used improperly.<br>  For instance; If you look at the top 300 reasons people are brought into emergency rooms, overdoses on steroids use/complications are somewhere around number 297 in the list.

S08uUTbbaa	A planned economic system is set up based on the subjective desires of the planner.  This goal usually includes some type of income equality or production schedule/rationing to ensure that each person is treated equally.  The result is generally a lower overall standard of living, but most everyone has an equal amount of nothing.  A problem is that the system is entirely subject to the whims of the planner, who could be wrong in his supply/demand calculations or biased toward his friends.
pQGUPITeaa	I guess it might suggest that if men only use half their brain, they shouldn't be allowed to have any jobs involving evaluating beauty - such as beauty pageant judge, art critic and so on.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Nice. Now I know why I find almost every woman attractive.|`|oFR4yvHaaa	Men are wired differently.<br>  <br>  Women judge beauty more on "usefulness" to THEM. This is why they often have to get to know a guy before finding him attractive.<br>  <br>  Men don't care about usefulness... we see beauty as beauty, period. That's why we can hate who a woman is and STILL find her attractive at the same time.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I don't know much about brains but my guess is that a difference like this would be hard wired. Men and women have adapted differently on many levels.|`|WKtakdsOaa	I dont really think I see beauty differently to men. Everyone has different tastes and its an individul thing|`|ZjCurM7saa	It's because men can do with half a brain what takes women their whole brain.|`|KF8CHY2faa	Good question, I actually think it's a little bit of both to be honest. For example, men will always (in most cases) be attracted to the shape of a woman body. May he like her hips and thighs or her T&A; a man (in my opinion) will be 'hardwired' to be attracted to the shape of a woman.<br>  <br>  But, as we evolve, the idea of what forms the attractive female anatomy changes. Example, there was time when a size 14 was sex (in my opinion still is). Marylin Monroe was this bombshell that captivated the imaginations of many men from all walks of life. She was what today's society would consider 'plus size'. But with this diet craze that has swep the nation, our men (soceity) look more for women who pretty much look like they haven't eaten in days. Not all men feel this way, some still prefer the curves, but our society feels that a size 14 means she's had one to many cupcakes, thus making her unattractive to many. The images we see in the media has convienced many woman that in order to be considered attractive, you must be able to see her rib cage. <br>  <br>  But you know what's funny about all this, there was a study conducted recently where a group of men had female models walk in front of them of all sizes. And the men picked the women that they perceived to be 'perfect'. And almost every woman they picked was a size 6 to a size 14. But when they where given pictures of women that they thought where 'hot', the women they picked as being the most attracitve where a size 2 to 6. So when the woman where in front of them, they picked the more 'curvery' women; but when they where looking at them in pics they thought the women where all the same size. Odd huh?

They are also there to make sure that you don't get shot if you ever say this in public. No they can not be there before you dialed 911 but guess what you can't defend your family before you see them in danger; no difference between you or them.  Actually there is a difference they risk their lives so that you can have your messed up opinions about the law and law enforcement.  And that "corrupt law" makes sure that those "worthless" cops don't just put you away for reading this. <br>  <br>  You should keep these type of opinions to yourself.

It serves as a last resort for when people are in dire circumstances and cannot afford to live off welfare to support them in their needs.<br>  <br>  However, the underground economy may not be a good thing as it can be bad. Particularly people who make a living from selling in the black market may not do so because it was a last resort, but however, they simply just chose to do so because perhaps the lucrative business of illegal trade was alluring enough for them to join. For society this is bad, because there is corruption. Not only that, it can serve as a plague for society as more people are hooked onto these harmful drugs.<br>  <br>  ________________<br>  <br>  BTW<br>  <br>  When calculation for GDP, economists estimate as to how much money circulates in the underground economy.|`|VuLiR7SCaa	Black market to me can go both ways legal and illegal.The black market is how third world countries get a hold of certain items at times, whether it's for a good cause or not.

This might mean the government would have to cut expenses and/or increase taxes.<br>  <br>  Not paying the debt is far less likely than say, not paying social security or cutting social security and medicare and such. More likely than that is an increase in taxes and some cuts- well, see Obama's proposals for reducing the budget short fall...
0n04tIJ6aa	IMHO it is because we put the onus on men for evolving the financial initiative within the whole archaic media driven present day courting ritual.<br>  <br>  You can observe this every Valentines Day. How many news segments /articles actually focus on women romancing their men with gifts? Bet it will be a bit harder to find. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying women "expect" romance on this particular Hallmark Holiday..but a lot do. <br>  <br>  Instead of putting the financial onus on men during these times we flip the expectation around that if he performs the initiative the probability of the woman reciprocating will increase. Generally we see it as her putting out.<br>  <br>  There are times when I would like to see the initiative reversed.  A healthy balanced romantic relationship cannot be nurtured if the initiatives and expectations from both individuals are one sided.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I think because men are under more pressure to be wealthy and be the provider.

I personally don't consider my boyfriend cheap if he doesn't get me anything for valentines day.

I am very grateful for what my boyfriend gives me, and when I have money I, too, like to spend it on him. It should go both ways in a relationship.|`|c1iopYwbaa	Sometimes its not the woman being cheap. Now i hear many people complaining about their man being cheap but sometimes thats not the case. Now a days lots of men are cheap by asking a woman to do this and that for them which is 100% rediculous anyways...Well this answer is just from experience.|`|2eWVaB9Waa	Couples would be a lot happier if they realised that no material possession is better than actually being and doing things together.|`|Xy1XH5gVaa	You really are generalising too much, it make the question sound less intelligent than it should.|`|2UnjeOQUaa	Maybe that is the trade. Man pays - Woman skanky|`|ZqjGWbavaa	This is a very good example of why there's a serious problem with gender roles in modern society. While the feminist movement has liberated women from many of the restrictions and limitations placed on them (which is good) no change has come to men's roles. Things like unequal laws are just a symptom of attitudes in society, things that both women and men enforce on men. Always paying for dates is a good example of this.<br>  <br>  The bullsh*t about women's wages being 70% (or 77%, or 76%, or whatever number NOW wants to quote this week) is just that, bullsh*t. But even if it weren't, men making more money is no reason why all men, everywhere, should buy women dinner most of the time (or worse, be obligated to buy them expensive gifts on VD). If one partner makes more money than another, it could make sense for that one to buy dinner, if both are comfortable with this. When my friends have gone out to dinner, my (female) best friend has bought me dinner several times, because I couldn't have (and wouldn't have) afforded to go out with them otherwise. I could see this making sense for a dating schematic too.<br>  <br>  But putting the financial expectation on men just because they're men and they're "supposed" to, or they're negotiating buying sex from the woman is retarded. I don't need sex badly enough that I'm willing to float it an unlimited supply of money.<br>  <br>  None of which really answers your question. Attitudes about gender roles have not changed sufficiently (at all, really) for men and they're still expected to operate like women belong on pedestals and as if their "flower" (as one male friend of mine actually referred to it) is something to be bought and bribed. It's dumb, and it doesn't belong in an egalitarian society.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Women are very generous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, with my money<br>  <br>  they are only cheap with their own.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's a nesting instinct ?|`|IwUpusQiaa	silly double standards and society's high expectations of a man's weight in a relationship.<br>  just disgraceful.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	If a woman wants equality then every once in a while she should pay for the meals and pay for the movies. I mean, it is only fair. It is not fair to expect a man to pay for everything. In this economic depression, people are losing their jobs; people are cutting back so, yes, every once in while it is a good idea for the woman to pitch in during a date.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I'd never call a guy cheap for those reasons. Honestly the people who would I think are very shallow and unhappy, unless they have good reason (e.g. he NEVER pays for anything and even borrows their money to buy her gifts, which I have seen happen to somebody until the guy ran off)<br>  <br>  In my real life the finances of dating have never come up with anybody I've dated or any friends, the girls I know are all too busy getting to know the guy rather than find out what he can pay for.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Too many women have been sold lies by feminism that their company is value enough for any man's money. Providing he pays for it - he is rewarded with the pleasure of her company.<br>  <br>  What these individuals fail to realise, is that in today's world of equality (lol), a man's company is just as precious and rewarding as is hers. So, she should be offering to pay a bit more often (so it's closer to 50/50 instead of 0/100)|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I'm generally a very cheap person, and I like it better when the guys I date are the same way.

I have very strong hate towards some people (not getting into details), but some of them are so ignorant and inconsiderate etcetera. Smoking weed is the only thing that helps. Telling people doesn't do anything, and bottling it up only works temporarily. Weed brings you to an understanding of things, and really calms you down, be you angry, sad, or anything. It's hard to explain. Just smoke weed and you will know.

a0e860622cad16b1ca5481f614822134aa	Intervention helps a lot. I used to use marijuana heavily and my friends, not my family, talked to me and just said that I was getting out of control and needed to stop permanently. That really spoke to me, because I've always listened to my friends more than my parents. Moreover, they all decided to quit with me, and that made it a lot easier. This had a great affect on me. When I still smoked, I had mediocre grades and was not planning on going to college, and now, 6 years later, I'm finishing my doctorate in cognitive psychology at Cornell, and was just offered a professorship at Cornell upon completion of my dissertation defense.<br>  <br>   I don't know if any of your ex's friends enable him to drink (but his new girlfriend obviously does)  but it's gonna talk all of the people he cares most about sitting down with him and telling him that he's...killing himself, and don't be any nicer than that: he needs to hear the truth. Hopefully, hearing how his drinking affects himself and especially everybody close to him will help him get inspired to quit drinking all together. After all, he is truly the only person who can go through the quitting process, and if he falters, then he will fail.

So the best that you can do is to let them know that you're there for them, with out enabling them to continue with their drinking and that you'll be helpful if and when they want it.  Most of this can't be done with out support from others. Either doctors AA or some other organization that works with alcoholics.|`|AA11780840	Unfortunately, you need to let him hit rock bottom.

This is the only way he will sober up in a heartbeat. Being taken away to jail.... again. Touch love...He needs to go in to rehab..<br>  Intervention....<br>  Good Luck ...

AA12298537	First of all, loneliness is a very tough challenge. I respect your situation.<br>  <br>  It's pretty counterintuitive since you need success in social situations, but are you perhaps 'too' afraid of making mistakes ?<br>  <br>  Babies learn commanding their limbs fingers etc. with a lot of trial and error. Bringing their finger to their forehead takes a while. They first move both hands to their face. Only after some time they form a more delicate and precise control over their movements.<br>  <br>  So even though it's literally painful to be rejected, it's a good idea to keep trying (not too hardly, just getting out, being there) to immerse yourself in social situations.<br>  <br>  Being challenged in multiple areas, perhaps even constantly questioning your orientation in life, it's only natural that your concentration on classes and your self esteem fall down.<br>  <br>  Finding motivation to do stuff can be a little tricky if you are expecting something to happen. However if you can enjoy the very basics, it can lead to greater fulfillment in time. <br>  <br>  Just to be out and enjoying it a little. Maybe not making friends right away. Or not getting good grades right away. But starting to get interested in the subject at hand at that moment. Slowing down, taking your time, even though the anxiety and doubt keep pushing.<br>  <br>  Again it's not about holding yourself against your urges, but accepting the situation.<br>  <br>  Cheers =)|`|2U2dqAa3aa	I would start with the college counsellor which should be free.<br>  <br>  On a larger view, I would try to get a hobby that hopefully involves others.<br>  <br>  Spend some time outside every day, it evens out your system.<br>  <br>  If you're in a dorm, keep the dorm room door open and you'll be more in touch.

8d8ejHPfaa	Mig.....*sigh*....I don't know what to tell you, you're only in 8th grade, and you've spent the last 3 years carrying a torch for a boy who you apparently had a relationship of some kind with for a year in elementary school?  I realize that a lot of the crying and stuff just goes along with the territory and has a lot to do with hormones and stuff, heaven only knows I cried all the time at your age, but this doesn't sound healthy, even for an adolescent girl, it sounds like you're obsessed with him...Mig, I think what you should do is tell your parents that you are depressed, tell them why you're depressed, and see about getting some counseling.... I guess he must have been your first love or something, but if this is how it is now, what's going to be in high school, or college, or after college?  Are you going to hang on to something that happened in elementary school for the rest of your life? It sounds like you are spending an awful lot of your time thinking about him, are you doing anything with your life besides that, or just spending every minute of your spare time thinking about this boy?  Do you have any after school activities, or clubs or classes you could do to help get your mind off of it for a while?  Someplace you can go meet other people?  If not, I hope you can find your way to joining a youth group or something where you can go hang out with other young people, and meet new boys to appreciate...good luck Mig...|`|YaM8Elxtaa	You could try hypnosis.

Alot of people are like that.<br>  <br>  Sorry if that doesn't help- I'm kind of dumb!!!|`|4zscfvvoaa	You question leaves me to draw many conclusions.  Are you wondering if you have to be feeling-less to be a sociopolitical killer or something?<br>  <br>  You sound as if you have some slight issues to work out.  You sound as if you are anti-social and possibly have some anxiety.  You don't have to be feeling-less to have a psychotic episode.  Anyone, and truly, anyone can have a psychotic episode if the right seres of events fires in a short period of time.<br>  <br>  You should talk to family, friends, or professionals about the issues that you are having.  Some find strength and re-enforcement through spiritual paths.  Meditation practices could help you to control your anger.<br>  <br>  You will only rep what you sow.  The more effort you put into self improvement, the more improvement you will gain.<br>  <br>  You state that you hate even yourself.  This is a big issue.  I would not take this lightly if I was you.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	A sociopath is someone who doesn't care if what they do hurts others in fact they get a certain amount of satisfaction in hurting and controlling others.  They want things their way and they don't care what they have to do to get it.  They have no real conscious and don't care that they don't. Someone who's psychotic is someone's who's lost touch with the reality that everyone else shares.  IF you've become psychotic that means that what you're experiencing isn't what the rest of the world is, So because you're having severe problems does not mean that you're either psychotic or a sociopath.  It means that you have to get the help that you need and to want to change things in your self and in your life.|`|AA12059817	Psychotic means having to do with the mind..so chances are your already psychotic. It could be a personality disorder, or just depression, or a mix. I'm sorry your suffering. For the title question..no you don't have to be feeling less..I think most people who are that way (really messed up) it's a matter of to strong of emotions, rather than none at all. I'm considered "psychotic" and my issue is definitely way too much emotion, and not enough rationality-or reality for that matter.|`|XhzvFAK2aa	Sort it out with yourself, or you will end up a basket case and other people will treat you that way- you will be really unhappy.  See a prof, and don't let it go on, some nasty mechanisms could come into play-unconscious psychological defense mechanisms. You don't wanna be la-belled as either, you could end up with a bad reputation, and i am guessing you are still young-not good for you or your human relationships. I know being in human race is tough, and people are rotten and callous, but there is still a lot of decent folk in the world, that would be good to be around, for you. Don't close your mind off to it.  Good wishes.

9b6acf55d27a39548c86f16f9efbd431aa	If a person mistreats me I would rather assume that they have a personality disorder than attribute their behavior to their race. That's why we have so many problems getting along.  Sometimes a person has had a bad day and sometimes you run across a person who is just anal-ly retentive by nature. As for the sexism part. IDK, I wasn't there to witness the scenario.  <br>  <br>  P.S.  Is this a parable or a real story?

Why didn't you get out and punch her?  you would've done the world some good getting rid of a crazy.  : )|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Well seeing as you don't know what she said I don't have a clue if it was sexist or racist. In fact, maybe there was more to the incident than you witnessed.<br>  <br>  But she does sound like she has anger issues, a lot of people get really mad - road rage! And yeah possibly if he hadn't been a guy and hadn't been black she wouldn't have yelled the help though it really depends why on earth she was doing that! So considering I don't know what went down really, and don't understand her behaviour at al, then I can't hypothesise what it would have been like with somebody else.<br>  <br>  Two white girls can have pretty big fights together about parking spaces and stuff.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|qgL98Wv2aa	i think she yelled because she has a mental problem like maybe being bi-polar or something to the effect......please all of you PC people out there don't say that i'm insensitive to those kind of people just realistic to the fact they can act this way........|`|goSI2nAEaa	There are so many crazy people out there.

It was a good thing he wasn't the type to produce a gun or gotten out of the car to knock her head off.|`|fJy0vN7daa	The women had ISSUES!!!<br>  <br>  Maybe she just got dumped and took it out on the guy.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	She probably was, but I can't say for sure.  She sounds like an idiot though.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Possibly.  It sounds to me that she was just having a bad day.|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	It's possible, but there's really not enough evidence.  She was probably just taking out her anger on some innocent guy.  That may irrefutably make her a *****, but it doesn't necessarily make her racist or sexist.<br>  <br>  Olisbos:  Just because the Klan was created by men does not mean women had no involvement in lynchings.  In the earlier days of the Klan if a white woman felt she had been disrespected by a black man, that person would likely end up lynched.  Women attended public lynchings.  Just because they were not technically official members does not mean they had nothing to do with the organization.|`|vvgmyX04aa	Yes of course she was. Women are conniving evil creatures who will do anything we can to get over on men!<br>  <br>  But you knew that already, didn't you?  After all, that is the moral of this story and all of your other stories about women here.
NAGiNKFWaa	I am potty training a new puppy and I take her potty every two hours day and night.  The complexity of my day to day life is to function without sleep.  I have to manage to make breakfast without burning it, or some days I have all I can do to put cereal in a bowl and pour milk over the cereal and then I have to manage to put the cereal back on the shelf and the milk in the fridge all by myself.  It takes me all day to pay the bills that used to take an hour of my time.  It took me 4 days to get my plants watered, and it usually takes one day.  The ironing piles up for the weekend when I make my husband watch his puppy while I get the ironing caught up.  Sometimes I even manage to brush my teeth more than once a day.  A complexity in my husbands life would be.....covering shifts when his staff gets arrested, but the school has a hiring freeze.  oops|`|bjqjkDMHaa	To me, the way people interact.

H2oCXK35aa	To dream that you are holding hands with someone, represents your connection with that person. Your dream may also reflect anxieties about losing touch with him/her or that you are drifting apart.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|gplfqOEHaa	That his feelings for you are more stronger or will be.|`|JmtCvoqMaa	Maybe (unless you're already going out with him) it's telling you that you should ask him out, or tell him how you feel. <br>  <br>  I've had several drems like this myself and far from leaving me feeling happy, they leave me feeling empty and confused... but that's because I'm in love with him and he doesn't feel the same way.  <br>  <br>  I've liked  him for four years now and I'm trying to move on, but it's so hard. I suggest that you tell the guy about your feelings so you can move on with your life quicker if he tells you he doesn't feel the same.
89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	There are people like you out there. Go out and meet people. Most people really don't know how to handle themselves either. You can get mad at yourself but that won't help. Practice makes perfect. You may anger a lot of people along the way but once you feel you've gotten better you should try contacting those people and show them that you've changed. Confidence is something that is really hard to get, just put yourself out there and keep on going with your life. You'll get better if you meet new people. And at the end of the day you can look back at what you did and feel confident that you at LEAST tried.|`|BgdwgVtKaa	Take it positively like, you know:Being angry sometimes helps you to be motivated and get you determined to succeed.|`|dB2uMDb5aa	no i dodn't think its norman but howevery in your case it could be yes i can see that you have had a hard life i think that you spent a lot of years being abuse, so you did what you hade to do at that time, so i think you should put it all bhind you and start a new life allso if you or takeing a lot of pills to set thrue the day that could be part of it  i hope you do find the answer you or looking for  may GOD bless|`|paQl4u9laa	physchiatrist|`|4Vswcoqeaa	Be glad at least you are keenly aware of your situation.  Too many people just act like blind [insult].<br>  There certainly must be folks out there, who although can't see things entirely from your side, will understand your shakiness is just part of your nature.  I think eventually you'll run into someone who could spare a moment to actually listen to what you have to say instead of dismissing you.  You've gotta have faith in that.<br>  And also remember, this "life" you think you've missed out on isn't all it's cracked up to be.  If you didn't have this problem, you would have some other problem.  But do relax!  Don't try to simply appear relaxed- this will only make it worse, for relaxation shouldn't require effort.

He took huge risks and in all honesty, it's made sex less taboo as a result of it.  The first playboy came out in a time when sex was kind of a dirty little secret if you weren't married.  Married couples on television programs weren't even shown sleeping in the same bed.  Nowadays sex is generally seen as something natural and not something to be ashamed of.  Hef had a lot to do with making that possible.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Personally, I don't give two straws for what he did for the "adult entertainment" industry. I think he's a dirty old man. <br>  <br>  But I guess you're right, he is a good businessman. He's certainly succeeded at what he does. Although really...how hard is it to sell a magazine full of naked women? LOL Pretty much anybody could do that.|`|YwE5kIB8aa	I concur with furry guy, the luckiest man on the face of the planet in the history of the world.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	I like him but I feel as businessman he could not keep up with the times as pornography evolved in the media and sexual imagery became more sophisticated his PlayBoy was kinda dinosaur of dirty mags. I feel he is like Russ Solomon of the Tower Records fame. Yeah, he was great at first but as times changed he was stuck in his ways and could not keep up with the times. Also, he was one-dimensional as a PlayBoy publisher. I was looking at Gene Simmons' magazine Tongue inaugural issue and it featured all the Play Boy bunnies from the past year and truth be told, they all look the same! It was mostly white women who were blue eyed, blonde haired, slim waist, and it was the same over and over and over again. Have some ethnic variety with your dirty mags is what I am thinking.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I like him.  I don't care what anybody else says, the guy's okay in my book.  He seems sweet, funny, and obviously a smart entrepreneur.  Plus, I love the fact that he describes his youth as "really bisexual".  I like a man who's open like that.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying he's incredible or anything, and I'm not saying that Playboy isn't without faults (because I have quite a bit of criticism for them, especially about airbrushing!) . . . but Hugh Hefner is okay by me.|`|nhZb43pIaa	I think he's just ick...icky, creepy and pathetic.<br>  Business wise he really needs to update Playboy......boring, zzzzzz.<br>  As far as him lighting a fire under the adult industry, ah, not so much. It was already heading that way, 1960 was right around the corner.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	he is the luckiest man on the planet AND the smartest man on the planet. no doubt in my mind about it.
sAN0IDOeaa	the world should promote better behavior and not try to constantly show ideas that hurt people in any way(like constantly showing completely fit people when there are so many obese people)|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Most people prefer information that is honest and trustworthy and benefits all who seek it
cKbeUyq9aa	I'm not sure how to answer this to be honest. I'm 15 and I'm the same. I'll be happy and everything for about 4 hours and I'll be confident, cocky and be funny, it's really good. However, I remember about all the bad things in my life at the moment and it all comes crashing down again.<br>  <br>  The thing I suggest is to never regret anything, if there' something you want to do, just do it! This will give you the feeling of relief and make your mind positive because you've done something you wouldn't normally do.<br>  <br>  Also, no offense, but it could be your hormones are you in your teens because it could simply be puberty.  If it is due to puberty then you basically have to wait it out until you cheer up again.<br>  <br>  My final advice is, do you have a boyfriend? I've always found out that I'm a lot more happier when I'm 'with someone'. This is probably why I get moody anyway (having troubles getting a girl a like...anyway..)<br>  <br>  I hope I've helped, I know what it's like you just have to try and get past it.|`|AA11899313	Don't know, but if you are one of those 'good mood in the morning people' who were to always shine out at that time, then I'd hunt you down with my 'Brilliant Mood detector', and dispatch you ....to some far away place via DHL or some other carrier ~ where you'd be put to work for one the many 'Fake Lottery Winners' scammers in Nigeria.<br>  <br>  There you'd be made to work 24 / 7 typing their stuff up ...and teach you some severe lessons in the process.<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|4Vswcoqeaa	Ups & Downs are part of the human experience.  You only recognize certain moods as "good" because of their contrast with moods that are "bad".<br>  <br>  Just try to talk yourself down when you go to either extreme.

iUzSlmSbaa	I don't know if he just said on the spur of the moment in an argument that he doesn't love you anymore.. people say a lot of hurtful things and don't really mean them.. but the last thing they want when in a kind of rage.. where they are so far as already packing some of their belongings and wanting to drive off, is to talk common sense.. I think that this argument made him fly off the handle completely to jump up from the argument, and throw some clothes and belongings in his suitcase and take that suitcase to the car.. that was all very impulsive action.. not a thought through action.. He had not made a plan to leave you.. otherwise he would have found some time when you were gone and would have packed all of his belongings properly.. then he would have told you '' I don't want this here anymore, I don't love you anymore'' so I don't believe really what he said is what he meant.. I think he was not himself at that moment he said those words... he doesn't only want to come back because of his dad... maybe partly because of his problems with his dad but also because he is not sure what he feels.. he needs some time to think. So I believe whatever you do, you should talk to him and ask him when he has calmed down..  what exactly is going on.. it's never good in the heat of the moment to want to talk sense to someone who is in a rage...you should have let him go... but it's understandable you wanted to know then and there why he was packing..  this is an impulsive guy.. I don't know how much he loves you.. but he didn't mean what he said, the way he said it..  I don't believe that he doesn't love you anymore at all but I would not be sure how much he still loves you...  He owes you a lot of answers to your questions when he has calmed down.. and you know him better than we do... but this is a guy who acts on impulse.. so also what he says is often done on impulse and therefore some of the things he says, he regrets later and didn't mean them.. so I don't believe that he meant to say he doesn't love you anymore.. he really resented to talk common sense there and then.. but you both urgenty need to have a lenghty discussion.. put everything on the table and talk to each other. respectfully.. listening and talking.. If he was usually an honest guy.. then he will tell you the truth now that he has calmed down.. if you could believe him to not lie.. then he won't lie to you now just to get back with you if he really doesn't love you anymore.. in any case.. you both should talk.. this was totally a chain reaction, not a planned blow out, he acted without thinking and planning so he did not plan leaving you that day.. that happened because of the argument.. he flew completely off his handle. so whatever happens you should talk to each other and clear the air.. and find out what you both still mean to each other.. he will tell you now that he had time to calm down..|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Probably so.  You say things you don't mean sometimes in the middle of a heated argument.  If I were you, I'd leave him alone though.  Too much fighting involved with him.|`|MOXa0tvOaa	When people are mad/upset they say things they don't mean. I'm sure he didn't really mean that...|`|4EHhiA47aa	I can tell by your question that you already understand what is going on here. You have two concerns as I understand your question. First, you believe that you may be to persistent in trying to get an answer that will settle your issue. Second, you are asking does your boyfriend really love you or is he only interested in doing things his way when he wants. <br>  The answer to your question can only be answered by you and your boyfriend. I do get the feeling that you can be more demanding than he desires, especially when he is upset. You need to look at your past relationships and see if there is a pattern. While talking out your differences and resolving issues is a great idea, both parties need to be ready to talk and LISTEN. I would recommend that you try and let some time pass before coming up with the big answers.<br>  <br>  As far as your boyfriend goes. Is he psychologicaly balanced? What do you know of his other relationships? Is he a controlling person? Is is a spoiled brat who still hangs onto Momma's apron strings? Does he have the habit of blaming others for his problems?<br>  <br>  The fact that he called you after ALMOST having an accident does not mean he loves you. It could just be a call for pity. you need to look at all of these factors and play it one day at a time. If he is "in love with you" he will be there. His attempt to contact you after he cooled down indicates that.<br>  Good Luck

What makes me happiest is when she has a "good potty" Apparently the purpose in my life at the moment is to potty train another puppy, after I just got done potty training another puppy.  My dogs are clearly my reason for living and the reason I go through the insanity of training over and over, again.  The stress of training a puppy is clearly overwhelming, but if you survive it, you end up with a well trained, stable dog, and that is worth all the drama.  We just decided to take a nap, so maybe I get to spend 2 hours on the computer before we go potty again.|`|AA11899313	What makes ME get up in the morning?<br>  <br>  The bloody alarm and a need for tea and toast ...AND a desire to end the awful surreal dreams I have as a result of the medications I take.<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	I get up in the morning simply because I know things will get worse if I stop doing so.<br>  <br>  But I'm working on finding better reasons.

d20c758729ff5fc1bce5eab1c9b36379aa	There are probably a small percentage of men who lie or do terrible things.  That is not to say that all men nor all women act in bad faith.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	You are probably choosing some bad men to be partners with.<br>  <br>  Personally, I see no reason to lie about things.  I'd rather just tell the truth and move on without having to watch my back or be careful of screwing up and exposing my own lies on accident.<br>  <br>  And as for taken men, I imagine it's the same thing.  Though, I can see logic in lying to avoid nagging.  It's not like you can back hand a woman to shut her up nowadays.  So the more legal method is to simply withhold any info that would result in nagging.  Personally, I just laugh and go back to what I was doing.  But, I can see why guys would choose lying to avoid nagging.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Of course it's a choice.<br>  <br>  Stop dating liars. First lie he tells, dump his butt. Not all men lie, you know.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Yes, we do.  There is a switch that locks in as soon as we're in a relationship.  It goes from "Semi" to "Auto" much like an automatic rifle. It's a defence mechanism designed for self-protection. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, I just have a hard time handling this generalistic question.  How is this any different from when a man asks a woman if they're ok, and the woman says "Yes, I'm Fine", when honestly they're not really fine, they're really just p*ssed off and want the guy to try and figure it out.  Is that not the same thing as lying? To me it is. Is that not 'automatic'? <br>  <br>  Lying is about choice.  I think you know the answer to your own question.|`|6LPts66haa	Cassie, he lied because he thought your mom was a gold digger.

VvGOKmVAaa	Buckley 'll do that to ya ;-)<br>  nah seriously though, I never truly appreciated Jeff's brilliance until I listened through the headphones one night on my way to sleep. It's amazing what you miss until you REALLY listen. Grace was the song that hit me too (unfortunatley not quite in the same way as you dammit!) but emotionally. I found myself blubbering like a baby before the song was over, and not because I was sad, but it was more like a  total release of emotion, similar to that of being completely overwhelmed. there are many Buckley enthusiasts who have had similar experiences I'm sure...makes me glad that I am one of the lucky few, along with you it seems, that 'get' him.<br>  <br>  ;-)
8VUZDKdAaa	Yes I have been seeing and hearing those Cash for gold commercials for 5 years now and thought the same as you!!<br>  <br>  Amazingly, the other day I was listening to sattellite radio and heard two SEPERATE commercials back to back...  The first was a cash for gold commercial with that wonderful line  "after all cash is more valuable than useless jewelry in your drawer",  <br>  <br>  and the second was a different company stating that gold is the way to secure our wealth, urging us to BUY GOLD!!<br>  <br>  I could not believe these commercials were actually aired back to back, it's as if the ignorant majority were being made fun of.<br>  <br>  This film really nails it.

Still, there is some new money being created, mostly by the FED, and it is possible we will see higher inflation rates in the future as a result, but the FED will raise interest rates then to cool it.<br>  <br>  Money is not valued based on gold reserves, it is valued based on what people are willing to trade for it, same as anything else really.
lFzXZQQDaa	Responsibility is important because it teaches you to be independent.<br>  <br>  It changes your life when you get to the point where you need to start being independent and more responsible.|`|92yiQo7uaa	You accept that you are the boss/CEO of your life and stop blaming others for your life conditions.

Maturity, usually means that you have some youth, but the wisdom of experience, and take responsibility for everything about your life, encourages better feedback and and outlook.  That aside, it depends on life circumstances and whole experience, facts etc.  Hope gives you a few ideas.  I reckon everyone should know this.|`|8LhEs3WLaa	When you don't take responsibility for your action you will not learn the lesson of what you have done. This will cause you to make the same mistakes over and over again. If you lay blame on someone else for your actions you will eventually feel guilty. (Even 10 years down the track it could pop into your head). Being responsible for your actions starts as a child and you cannot progress into adulthood without it. Being responsible is not only for things you have done wrong but will give you joy when you have done things right.|`|cb422b6c3f9c9f2317116c9a1fcfe7d7aa	If you are not a responsible person--you  would go around naked--be destructive--never hold a job--not be able to raise your children or even have a good marriage.  Life would be useless without responsibility.

AA11707728	Usually, a person who accuses others of being judgemental is doing something morally wrong.....a drug addict, for example, is doing something anti-social, for which society would, at best, reject them for and, at worst, put a bullet in their head for (research the history of drug abuse in china....cough).<br>  <br>  There is a term for someone who does something wrong and then manipulatively trys to get you to accept that bad behavior from them by claiming something is wrong with you for not accepting it....assholism.<br>  <br>  And quite frankly, the only thing these people understand is 5 across the eyes.

S08uUTbbaa	A market economic system does not have any explicit social goals.  the entire system is oriented around the satisfaction of individual wants and needs.  The idea is that the sum of each individual's maximized utility equals the greatest societal utility.  There is little more to the idea of any kind of "social goal" to market economics than that.  It should be duly noted that the greatest social utility is not always achieved by maximizing individual utility, due to externalities and other forces that are not captured in conventional markets.
qgL98Wv2aa	definitely the right to vote........the birth control pill........being able to work while married it was common practice for businesses not to hire married women so that they wouldn't have to deal with their jealous husbands|`|gmaCvh00aa	You could add in women getting the right to legal assistance if they've been beaten by their husbands.  This wasn't even addressed in print media until the mid-1970's. During that time period several women who were in prison for killing their husbands appealed on a self-defense basis and won.  It wasn't that long ago, but there was a lot of resistance to the fact that they had killed their husbands even after years of documented police calls and beatings.  That's when the laws came out that said the police had the right to arrest an abuser whether or not the spouse pressed charges (spouse 99% of the time being the wife).  Before that the woman had to press charges and they wouldn't because they knew they'd get hit some more.|`|goSI2nAEaa	hmm, let me think<br>  ~how about women earning the right to vote<br>  ~women and the glass ceiling<br>  ~women's prochoice rights<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

5M0FBU89aa	Actually, I think anyone over 12 gets the adult test, but I could be wrong.<br>  <br>  Low IQ - Mentally Retarded 70 - 79<br>  Dull Normal IQ 80 - 90<br>  Normal IQ Score 91 - 110<br>  Bright Normal IQ Score 111 - 120<br>  Superior IQ Score 120 - 130<br>  Very Superior IQ - Genius IQ Scores  131 and Above<br>  <br>  ...So you're bright...  Congrats!<br>  <br>  Statistically, for "standardized" IQ tests, the following applies;<br>        2.5% of people are mentally deficient / impaired / retarded (under 70)<br>        50% of people have Intelligence Quotient scores between 90 and 110<br>      45.5% Have Bright to superior intelligence between 111 and 129<br>        2.5% of people are very superior in intelligence (over 130)<br>        0.5% of people are near genius or genius (over 140) <br>  <br>  BUT....<br>  Pretty much *anything* can influence an IQ test-  getting a good nights sleep/ partying all night, cold/flu, eating breakfast, etc.<br>  <br>  You will prolly do much better - Even going to the Superior or very superior range when you get a little older. Most people can improve their IQ by 10 points without that much effort.|`|YuUNESK5aa	It means your smart :)<br>  take it as a blessing

Or maybe someone has started rumours about you and something you were told was exaggerated by you ( giant egg).The dinosaur represents the burden of carrying something on your mind and it is 'eating' you.The dream is guiding you to relax yourself. It could  be also something you observe going on ( not related to you ) thus watching from a tree.Confront it and either accept it or solve the problem by talking with someone about it. You know what it is that troubling you so you have to do your best to solve it.|`|KRo3Ik3Baa	The house represents a friend that you are not sure you can trust, but you will have to think about who that is since it's in your subconscious, than take measures to watch what you say and do around that person.  The dinosaur is some situation you are watching unfold in your life, but you are not the main character in that event, you are witnessing it.|`|9CK62mixaa	First of all, in order to answer to your dream question, who was eating everything? ("And it started eating everything") The egg, You or the lady in the street? <br>  Okay, I'm assuming the egg, if it was the egg, who or what was in it?<br>  <br>  In most cases, dreaming of animals shows our inner selves. Certain animal characteristics or behaviors are associated with the dreamer. When you dream of an animal, see what associations it has for you.<br>  <br>  There are three main things you gotta keep in mind, a house, arrows and an animal?<br>  Do you feel safe going to this house, if you are who's house is it?<br>  <br>  Do you feel like you are being pursued?<br>  <br>  Is there any possibility that you might be pregnant?<br>  <br>  Also you may find some of the answers here: <a href="http://dreamdoctor.com" rel="nofollow">http://dreamdoctor.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mythsdreamssymbols.com/dreamforumdictionaries.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mythsdreamssymbols.com/dreamf...</a>|`|Ptfetyulaa	It mean you should lay off the hot sauce.<br>  I had these dreams before, and I was eating pickles and ice cream together before bed.|`|6IjBUqAfaa	Dreams don't have a meaning.

The giant egg with the dinosaur could big a big problem you are facing or someone you do not like. They are ruining everything in your life for what you have said(the arrows) while you sit and watch because you don't know what to do but you watch in secret.|`|BNqrvZyhaa	Ok mind you this is just a guess but maybe you feel hurt lately but you don't know why or from where. Have there been any major problems in your life lately? If so the dream may symbolize you running away from your problems and hurts. Instead of handling or solving the problems you are just watching them unfold. They seem too out of control, you feel like your life is out of control. Everything I just wrote down could be something you are aware of or a subconscious thing, or neither. I hope this helped. Good luck with your dreams (:|`|XWd8eboRaa	maybe it was things you thought, heard, or seen recently all mashed together, <br>  <br>  For instance, did you see an action movie?

The Department of Health and Human Services released a survey estimating that child abuse and neglect in the United States nearly doubled during the seven years between 1986 and 1993.<br>  <br>  It is estimated that there are 60 million survivors of childhood sexual abuse in America today.<br>  Source: Forward, 1993.<br>  <br>  Highlights from 2000 include the following as reported to law enforcement:<br>    67% of victims of sexual assault were juveniles (under age 18);<br>    34% of sexual assault victims were under age 12;<br>    1 of every 7 victims of sexual assault were under age 6;<br>    40% of offenders who victimized children under age 6 were juveniles (under age 18). Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)<br>  <br>  In the adult retrospective study, victimization was reported by 27 percent of the women and 16 percent of the men. The median age for the occurrence of reported abuse was 9.9 for boys and 9.6 for girls. Victimization occurred before age eight for 22 percent of boys and for 23 percent of girls<br>  <br>  An average of 5.5 children per 10,000 enrolled in day care are sexually abused, an average of 8.9 children out of every 10,000 are abused in the home<br>  Source: Finkelhor & Williams, 1988.<br>  <br>   "The earlier studies found that one-third of juvenile delinquents, 40 percent of sexual offenders and 76 percent of serial rapists report they were sexually abused as youngsters."<br>  <br>  So, one answer to your question is: any background anywhere!|`|FB5IjcHeaa	Some come from a very stable background and others a very sick family unit.

Such rapists would grow from the family where the father treats his wife with the same disregard or somehow gained a perception (led by friends of such nature) of woman as frail and submissive that further may lead to sexual objectification. (a milder from of this issue can be seen as promiscuity)<br>  <br>  More brutal rapes, like by genuine criminals, goes beyond sexual objectification. The abuse might have been imposed onto the rapist to the point of pathological insecurity and thus he seeks the opposite extremes to "allude himself" that he is in the side of dominance. Or he might hold a vendetta to the woman who had mistreated him (can be as lenient as dumping if the rapist originally has low self-esteem).<br>  <br>  Sadism paraphilia can also contribute to rapes, as sadists combine the concept of causing pain with sexual gratification, sadists that lose control over their libido and harbor the same disregard to women can become very dangerous rapists as well.<br>  <br>  Some family that strictly enforce abstinence may cause severe sexual tension to the adolescents, without proper release (i.e. masturbation) it may become a motive for violent outbursts of libido that goes beyond reasons and consequently leads to rape.|`|CsrtmXf2aa	They come from all backgrounds.  It's a socialized and/or mental issue and/or environmental factor in someones lives. It is also a means to feel powerful over someone weaker.  People who do this may have been abused, and/or have issues with woman and/or are sexually over stimulated.  They would be characterized as abusers.

IesiHHdxaa	Okay, keep in mind what Globalization does. When an area becomes Globalized, it is connected with many other cultures in the world, and generally speaking, industry becomes more prominent in the area. So what he is saying is that when this happens, the area that is globalized does not (in a sense) get destroyed, but because of the various cultures of globalized society, people start to turn away bit by bit from their own culture and conform with globalized society. For example: say western shops and other businesses come to a country in the middle east like the UAE. If you are an older Muslim nomad who is used to their traditional way of life, and all of the sudden this globalization takes effect in your country and all of your grandchildren are starting to get into things like skateboarding, hip-hop, other western things, and they have decided to live in a home wearing modern cloths and driving cars instead of roaming the earth, wearing traditional clothing and riding camels around, you have witnessed globalization. The locality still has some identity and therefore has not been destroyed, but people are not participating in that culture like in a traditional manner like grandparents because of how they now live, and therefore part of that cultural experience has been lifted out of it's traditional anchoring. Also keep in mind though that it doesn't always effect all places and that's why they say "particular localities" instead of like "all" or "most localities"
