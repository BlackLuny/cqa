I am a waitress and I know that I give good service even when I am at my worst.  I don't understand why people refuse to tip.  Even when its not me, my fellow servers also get stiffed when I know they do a great job.      And one more question... why do people thing $2 is a good tip?  Its not... unless your bill is $15 or under.      Please answer both questions!
