20090223055344AAwubBw	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	I have a Goodman GMS9/GCS9 Gas-Fired Warm Air furnace and it's not working.?	The Induced Draft Blower starts to run but there is no furnace operation.  The Integrated control module diagnostic LED is flashing 3 flashes.  The possible causes listed in the manual say:      1. Pressure switch hose blocked, pinched or connected improperly.   (I took of the front cover of the furnace and looked at this rubber Pressure switch hose and it looks fine to me)      2. Blocked flue and/or inlet air pipe, blocked drain system, or weak induced draft blower.   (I went outside and checked the flue and inlet and they both look fine, with no visible blockage.  I inspected the drain system that comes out of the side of the furnace and that also looks fine, with no visible problems.  The Induced Draft Blower sounds fine when it kicks on too, sounds strong with no audible odd or weird noises eminating from it.      3.  Incorrect pressure switch setpoint or malfunctioning switch contacts.   (I don't have any idea how the pressure switch setpoint could be off since I have never adjusted it and I have no idea how to adjust it or what would even be a proper adjustment of it.  As far as malfunctioning switch contacts, I don't know why they'd be malfunctioning, the furnace is in a clean dry furnace room with little or no dust and very little moisture.  Visibly, all of the contacts look great.      4. Loose or improperly connected wiring.     (I don't know how any of the wiring could be loose or improperly connected because the furnace has run for 3 years with no problems)         This problem all started about 4 weeks ago when the furnace would run, but never for long enough to get the house warmed up to the adjusted thermostat tempurature of 69 degrees.  It was keeping the house heated at around 65 degrees at that time.  Now it has entirely stopped heating whatsoever, with the blower turning on and then the Integrated control module LED goes from steady on to THREE quick flashes, meaning that there is a problem.  The flames never ignite and then the blower eventually turns off.        The gas flow is definintely on to the furnace and I have just recently installed a new filter.         Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm layed off and I really don't want to pay for a service call here.
