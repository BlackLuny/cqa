lgNr4wVIaa	Theres one near grossmont center off of the 8E, near the ralphs and flower shop.    8820 Grossmont Boulevard, La Mesa - (619) 463-0214|`|AA11452852	Don't bother.  Prices at Circuit City are mostly HIGHER than they were before the bankruptcy.  How can that be?  The 10-30 percent off that they are currently advertising is based on the list price.  But Circuit City usually sold at a discount.  In most cases--and especially for items that were on their weekly sales--their discount was better than what is currently being offered.      If you want to read a revealing column, check out this blog entry from a Circuit City employee:  http://consumerist.com/5137068/6-liquida...    At some point, the prices will go down.  But you are mostly better off buying online, at least for now.      I hope this helps.  Good luck!!
ZaadvJAXaa	I don't know of any websites, but I HAVE heard that most of the counties have closed up shop so to speak, and are now more "centrally located" because of the economy.  Many of the workers of the county offices on the lower rung of the ladder faced unemployment, while the higher-ups were moved to the "new" office.  For some, it is a far distance to travel, but they could choose to have a 4-day work week and things of that sort.  That's about all I know.  Good luck on your report and I hope you find more information.  = )
AX0hvk6taa	Try wikipedia.org    Or if you have specific subject for your homework, try the search engine. For example, you want to search on subject "music industry" then write in search bar "music industry+germany"    goodluck

dZxjXHA2aa	Try local salons, a lot of times they hire high school kids to sweep up hair and wash towels and stuff on weekends and after school.  Put up flyers to babysitting, try hitting up older people or people with lots of kids in your neighborhood to run basic errands for them for a fee (groceries, runs to the post office or drug store, etc.), take up simple basic house cleaning in your neighborhood put up some flyers to dust, vacuum, etc. and just book 2 clients on a Saturday at $25/pop|`|NWH4pySHaa	summer is coming up-you could try local day camps or even farther away sleep-away camps, they usually pay well.

NxzMU91qaa	You cannot simply buy it at a local store, especially since they make them in Hong Kong, I don't know exactly why but you definetly cannot buy locally. Its something to do with the use of piracy an R4 can grant.    Hope that helped.
96pG4IVGaa	I do not know about the university itself, but if you want to go there thinking you will be near the Miami you see on TV, think again.     This is not near Miami Beach and South Beach, it is about a 20minute to 1 hour drive to the beach depending on traffic. My roommate went to St Thomas and didn't seem to enthusiastic about it. He wanted to transfer but couldn't afford to lose the credits. It is very highly diverse, meaning it is a minority majority school. I have heard complaints of not being able to understand professors. I have never met any one who has grown up in south Florida that has attended this university.  I think it must attract people that think it is 'Miami" so it will be fun. It is local reputation would be summed up in, "why did you go there?"    The truth is that Miami main land is not a very nice place to live it is poor, high in traffic, lack of public transportation and nothing but a ridiculous nightlife scene that gets old after 2 weeks. The only saving grace for miami is its young art scene, if it was not for that it would be a total hell hole.|`|pVSdIinKaa	not sure about the learning and teaching but the campus is huge. i pass by it once in a while. the location meaning the neighborhood is not that good. but is a very very nice campus lots of trees surrounding it, gated all around and i never heard anything really negative about it. take a tour or look it up some more.

AA11452852	If you leave your job voluntarily, you are not entitled to unemployment benefits.  You only get unemployment compensation if you lose your job through no action of your own.  That basically means being laid off.  Quitting for personal reasons (even good ones) or getting fired for cause is a disqualification.     I know this is not what you wanted to hear, but you need to be aware of the reality here.  I hope this helps!!
