20090221002901AAeeXyU	Dining Out;Fast Food	I got a job at Taco bell and im wondering how hard is it to be a cashier, especially on weekends.?	im David, im 17 and I recently  got a job at Taco bell and im starting next saturday. I hate my friends for telling me how hard using the cashier is. Im very stress and worried about that, and usually i dont worry much about things like this. It feels like the first day of high school...kinda. So is it REALLY HARD being a cashier? like, will i remember all those things, and if you know, how long did it take you to learn how to use the cashier completely? also, i have transportation problems. I live like 5 miles away from the taco bell i am going to work for, and i dont want to tell him i might have such proms cuz he might fire me...well im unsure. And.........MY BOSSS told me that sometimes i might have to fill in someone else's shift if they cant come (basicly that i should expect to work from 3pm to midnight sometimes), and i forgot to tell him, although he might know already, that IM 17 not 18, i live in LOS ANGELES, anyone under 18 cant be walking in the streets after 10 pm without an adult!!!! iS HE IGNORANT OR WHAT???? and the bus ride from work to my house is like 1.2 hours!!! i dont even know if the buses operate that late! PLEASE help me with advice and some answers, i will appreciate it so much! thanks!
