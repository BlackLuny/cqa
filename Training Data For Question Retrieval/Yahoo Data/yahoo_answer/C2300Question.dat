20090205041645AAQ6oVC	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help me with this essay!?	Here it goes:      With the fastest growing of the economy and the lack of time, many people have been working in this new way of work.      One good example of telecommuting in our modern society is when a woman have to take care of her little baby but at same time she wants to work. As long there's no one to take care of her baby, doing a telecommuting work at home, she is able to work and take care of her chield with no worry.      Many young bussiness men start their carrear by saling their products online just being at home. It is important to mention telecommuting advantages such as low investiment because all you have to do is to buy a computer and have a internet connection at home or wherever you wish to work in.       The schedule is for sure the best point in this type of job. You do not have a specific time to get sarted. That means you can work whenever you want as long you want, however, such a lack of commitment requires a lot of determination. If you are not a determinated person or a responsable one it is better to look for a regular job.      Finally, I like the idea of freedom that the telecommuting jobs can offer but, as mentioned, it is important to have determination and be serious when working. Things will not go fine as long we mix personal life into work life.      Please, make any correction if necessary. Thaks!

My niece, a high school junior who has a 4.35 (with AP courses) GPA, wants to go to a private, very expensive university which is 200 miles from home. With scholarships and student loans she'll owe about $200k when when she graduates in 4 years. Living expenses there will be $12K a year.       She can get the same degree at our state university for $50k and probably can get most of it paid in scholarships.  She won't even talk about it. We toured both campuses and she says state u doesn't "challenge her enough". Her mom cannot afford to send her to the out of state private school and we have talked ourselves blue in the face trying to make her see. She'll be 22 and $200k in debt. Even our campus guide on the state school tour told her he couldn't go to the private school either because of the money issues.       She mainly wants bragging rights for going to a private school and since my son (her cousin) is going to the state school, she wants to be different      Anyone have any wise words for her?  It might sound better coming from a stranger than from us. She thinks we just want to hold her back...

Ever since I attended the school, people have always compared us (she was there first). However, everyone always talked about how I'm such "a great pianist". I never did anything to fuel these conversations, I simply practice and perform at concerts. Once, I had to perform at a concert before she played her instrument, and she rolled her eyes before taking the stage. (I have never done anything to her, in fact, I even congratulated her after her recital - but still, she mostly gave me the cold shoulder).        One semester, we were both taking a composition course and the girl asked me to play the piano part to one of her pieces. I was surprised, but I thought that she had simply decided to be friendly. I agreed to play.      She gave me the score and it contained lots of sixteenth notes and grace notes that do not lie under the fingers well (she was not a pianist). I asked her about the tempo of the piece and she said that it was very slow and that I didn't have to worry. Because we were using many of the same instrumentalists, she also requested that we hold our practice at the same time and take turns working on each of our pieces. I agreed to this also.      During the rehearsal, she started out conducting at a breakneck speed. I noticed that all of the other instrumentalists had whole notes and I was the only one with faster notes. (The saxophonist had a few triplets for about four measures, but he had his part for about three months because he was her boyfriend.) I could barely keep up, and I'm usually a competent pianist. Every time that I would make a mistake, she would look at me with an evil look and then look at her friends with a smirk. She then began to conduct even faster, almost to the point where it fell apart. She would call out every note that I missed (as if she had perfect pitch and I didn't - we BOTH do.) Her presence and her attitude made me so nervous that I missed even more notes because she stood extremely close to me and look over my shoulder as I practiced and announced my mistakes before taking her score away. In addition, she used up all of the rehearsal time, which she said that we would share, so that none of the instrumentalists had time to practice my piece.      Afterward, she sneaked and told the teacher of the class that I did not do well in rehearsal and that she couldn't use me as a pianist. On top of that, she boldly stood in the practice room and called out every note that I missed and then asked for her piece back.      As a competent musician, I have never been through such an ordeal. What do you think that she was trying to prove by making me appear to be incompetent? Was it on purpose or an accident?      Additional Details:   (By the way, I think that she might be a little "unstable" in her perfect pitch abilities because I often notice her humming flatly and then playing a note on the piano to get into "tune" for that day. People with perfect pitch usually don't have to do that.  I know that perfect pitch and singing are two different things, but it seems as if she is memorizing certain pitches for the day or something...)      I don't know... she could be faking the whole "perfect pitch" thing... but I haven't told anyone that; it's her business!

20090205070426AAbIO95	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Whats on your mind? Read below and respond.?	I agree with the POTUS, we have to act accordingly and swiftly. The scenario is overly obvious, the distribution of bail out funds given to the financial arms of this nation is not in use to bring about change and the ways that business was being conducted, rather these funds have been put into play to strengthen their immediate fiscal need. If you look further at the situation, a good business would prefer repayment of principle in times of crisis over profit. We are not seeing this with these companies, we are not seeing the high interest charges fall in order to bring payments back in line, thus continuing suffrage throughout the nation at the worse time in history.       Furthermore if your Senator or Rep. in Congress is not acting in the best interest of the people in your state, we have something in the US that says we can have them recalled back home and replaced. So those members of Congress and the Senate who continue to drag their feet, beware your state has eyes and they are watching you.

20090205072603AA13gSs	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I have two job options. Which should I take?	My current job is with a student loan company that has been downsizing since August 08. Out of a call center of 150 people, they kept me and four others. Every month they wait until the last minute to tell us whether they will extend our job for another 30 days because they are trying to find a buyer for the company so that we can start lending again. I LOVE this job, but right now I only take a call about once an hour and I never know month to month whether I'll even HAVE a job. The pay is great and the benefits are awesome but now that my husband is being laid off from his job I feel that I need something I can count on.      The other option I have right now is a temp to hir job at an accounting firm. I would be the receptionist. It's really laid back and they are willing to train me to do taxes, etc. Thinking about my future, this has the most potential. While I'm a temp (the first 500 hrs) I'll be taking a 2.5$ pay cut from what i'm making now. Once they hire me full time they'll raise my pay but I'm not sure to what. I won't have a chance to get benefits until JUNE 09 but once I do they pay the premium %100. It sounds like an amazing opportunity, but I'm having trouble letting go of my current job.       What should I do???

I am obtaining my degree in English to teach High School English. I live in Texas and am aware of the low cost of living in Texas. But I like the idea of living somewhere with more then one season (Texas seasons: Hot, and hotter).      I am looking into New Mexico, Colorado, Virginia, Mass., New Jersey, Washington, and Texas. I am considering Texas still because the cost of living is great.      Anyways, I want to move, and just need help balancing the cost of living for these states, teacher annual starting salary (but it is merely a means to an end to continue my education and become a High School counselor so I can help the students).      Which state has snow yearly that you can snowboard and ski? I am very big outdoors. Where is the cost of living low? Just need help!      Any other states to offer opinions work too!

20090205075300AAcpWPA	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can you review my speech?	its alread done and the topic is love      Love              Love is a confusing thing. You can love someone and not like them, and you can love someone but not trust them, and you can love someone you barely know. Sometimes you learn to love someone, and sometimes love may vanish before you even know it. But when you do love someone, you want to fight their battles for them; you want to protect them from sickness, from danger, and traumatic experiences. You would give life and limb for them, if it meant protecting them from harm. So what is love? It’s the insanity that brings you closer to a person, and that keeps you together through thick and thin, good times and bad, through sickness and health, to death do you part. That what a marriage vow is, it’s a vow of love.         And you can love a person, such as a relative, friend, neighbor, complete stranger. You can love an animal, a place, even an ideal. Love can be a strong feeling of like; it can be affection, or desire. In the U.K, it is even a term of endearment, such as dear, sugar, or darling. Love means that you care about a specific person or animal, and that you are concerned about them.   During hurricane Katrina, many people were told to abandon their homes, but thousands, stayed behind, unable to evacuate with their beloved pets, or seek a safe haven in a shelter with an animal. They ignored their own personal safety and risked their life because they loved their pets. Sadly many people and animals perished, and the backlash created a new law. A state must have an evacuation plan that includes pets, so that their owners will not risk their life for the love of a pet. The departure of a loved one, if temporary leaves us disheartened, and a permanent departure leaves us depressed, miserable, and feeling empty, vacant, meaningless. The pain may never disappear, and even if does, it may take months or years.  Love is so strong that it can cross barriers of language and race, and can cross cities, states, continents, and oceans. Love is a necessity for children. People and animals will suffer if deprived of love. Psychologist Harry Harlow reared monkeys with two artificial mothers, one a bare wire cylinder with a wooden head and an attached feeding bottle. The other a cylinder with no bottle but covered with foam rubber and wrapped in terry cloth. Harlow’s discovery surprised many psychologist: The monkeys much preferred contact with the comfortable cloth mother, even while feeding from the nourishing mother. Love is love, it cannot be manufactured, or processed, or mass produced, and mankind cannot function without it. Mankind dreams about love, writes books about love, and makes movies focused on love. You call it madness, but I call it love. Love surrounds us, the love of mankind, the love of ourselves, and the love of life. Nothing can stop love, and it will preserver as long as mankind.        True love cannot be destroyed easily. True love is for life, and knows no limits. Romeo and Juliet were determined to be together, and in death, they finally succeeded.  Though not as dramatic, hundreds of thousands, millions even struggle to be together, because of differences such as money, age, and race and other social barriers. But everyday they do succeed, through adversity; they accomplish true love, and try to live out their life happily ever after.

Take a look around your home, school, or any building, and complete these three activities:      Find five rectangles. Measure and record the dimensions of the rectangles in centimeters. Make sure at least one of these rectangles is a golden rectangle where the length is approximately 1.618 times the width. (In other words, the length of the rectangle should be a little more than ? times the width of the rectangle.)          In your notebook, make a scale drawing of three of the rectangles you have identified. Be sure that only one of the three rectangles is a golden rectangle.          Ask your friends and family (at least five people) which of the three rectangle drawings they find the most pleasing to view. Keep track of the results of your survey.    Part 3: Go to the discussion area of the course and make a posting in the Golden Ratio area. Your posting must include your responses to the following three statements:   Describe the three rectangles you used in your survey (give the measurements). Give a short statement about the rectangle your friends and family found the most pleasing to look at.         Comment on the following question: "Based on your research about golden ratios, do you believe there is something aesthetically pleasing about the ratio?" Be sure to support your response.         While you are in the discussion area, read another student's posting. Take a moment to respond to their posting. If you are not sure how to post a discussion item or respond to another student, go to Course Information and review the information.

Sentence Structure        Word Choice and Voice        Organization        Conventions and Mechanics             --------------------------------------...

Timed writing        Practice writing assessment        Discovery writing        Freewriting             --------------------------------------...             Question 12 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      Why can’t writers only use spell check to edit their work?        Spell check has very few common words listed.        Not all computers have the recommended version 5.0 or higher.        Spell check can tell if a word is misspelled, but it cannot tell if a word is misused.        Spell check misses seven out of ten errors in most programs.             --------------------------------------...             Question 13 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      Which statement best describes the topic sentence of a paragraph?        It connects one paragraph to the next.        It gives transition information for the next sentence.        It states the main idea of the paragraph.        It gives specific details about the main idea of a paragraph.             --------------------------------------...             Question 14 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      When editing, how can a writer fix a sentence fragment or incomplete thought?        Read several sentences and combine them all into one.        Add more punctuation to the sentence.        Leave sentence fragments within your writing, as they are important in effective writing.        Read each sentence carefully to find the subject and verb, adding a subject or verb if either one is missing.             --------------------------------------...             Question 15 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      Why should you replace “to be” verbs to improve your writing?        Since they are often misspelled, it is best not to use them very often.        Specific, lively verbs are better choices in effective writing.        Subject and verb agreement is more difficult with “to be” verbs.        They are misunderstood and should be limited in your writing.             --------------------------------------...             Question 16 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      When you are peer editing someone’s work, what is the best way to help the writer improve the writing?        Be extremely critical and point out all the mistakes.        Be positive, constructive and ask questions for clarification.        Be sure to ask what version of spell check they are using.        Be sure to rewrite the main idea and supportive details for them.             --------------------------------------...             Question 17 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      Which one of the following is NOT an example of publishing?
