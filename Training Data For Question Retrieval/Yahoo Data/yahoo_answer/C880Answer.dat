What I mean is if you are qualified for a job list the things they are looking for in your summary of qualifications (in a sescret yet professional way). I'm not saying lie, it just that I was reading online and read an article about how to get your resume noticed, one of the most important things they mentioned was to punch up your skills by adding what is most attractive to your prospective employer.

I have been working at home successfully for the past 2 years so I know what works. My online business is recession proof despite what the news is saying about the economy.    There are many work-from-home programs on the Internet today that will promise you the world, however most of these programs don't deliver on their promises. If you aren't careful you will end up joining a work-from-home program that just takes your money and leaves you with an empty pocket.    I know from firsthand experience which programs actually work and which ones will just steal your money. See, two years ago when my company was having layoffs I was worried about losing my job, so I started searching the Internet for ways to create a part-time second income.    After investing 8 months of my time and over $5700 in bogus money making programs I finally found a few work from home programs that actually work. Of the 28 programs I signed up for only one of them made me money. I have provided a review of this powerful system which you can check out.    I am now happy to say I no longer have a job with my previous company. No, I wasn't laid off, I retired just 6 months after I started using this system. I have been consistently earning between $15,000 and $22,000 per month using this work from home system.    Check it out and I hope this is the answer you've been looking for.

Z2iQdl53aa	I'm 16 and I've been looking for a job since I was about 13, too. Unfortunately, due to age laws, there are many jobs you cannot do. Also, many large companies (clothing outlets, supermarkets etc) will not hire you until you've finished your GCSEs.  I would say your best bet, if you don't want to babysit or have a paper round, is to get a job in a hairdressers as a Saturday girl.

QX3KiSxyaa	Hi--you can certainly be a lawyer that makes a LOT of money but expect to never see the light of day.<br>  <br>  Lawyers in general need to like reading, they read a lot, they work on reading, processing what they've read and then giving an answer based on their experience, their legal education background & what they've read in past legal journals and reports to give you an idea of how to present the case.<br>  <br>  It's true--most lawyers do make a good amount of money per hour. The issues come to billable hours and non billable hours<br>  <br>  Most associates at major law firms need to build 1400 billable hours a year--that means work directly relating to the case. Not checking email, taking time to surf the net, going home to visit your spouse or spending time researching a related topic with the hopes of finding a needle in the hay-stack.<br>  <br>  This usually requires for you to take on a LOT of cases and work many many MANY hours of overtime. <br>  <br>  I worked as an assistant for over 6 yrs at 3 different law firms & can tell you that most lawyers are ppl who've always done exceptionally well in courses that test their anaylitical skills. They are ppl who recall figures & facts quickly and don't have to 'sit & think' of the answer.<br>  <br>  Not to say THOSE other ppl can't become lawyers either just that the majority of high-priced lawfirms do come with highly paid lawyers who are just so busy that they have to spend a portion of their salaries to hire personal chefs because they simply aren't home ever enough to cook. Seriously.<br>  <br>  Doesn't seem like a bad idea now but when you get older--past 25--your energy goes down and then you're working 60+ hours a week, maybe you're getting 20-25 hours of BILLABLE time in that 60+ hours a week. If you have ASSISTANTS and students helping you--maybe you can bring that up to 45 hours a week? I am not sure but it's possible.<br>  <br>  Many Law firms do have job shadow days for students and it would be worth your while to write a few firms and ask for information interviews.<br>  <br>  Plus lawyers are relatively easy to find in any adult social circle, so another option would be to ask around to everyone you know if they know a lawyer. If so, can you buy the person a coffee to ask about their day-to-day.<br>  <br>  Overall, the work can be interesting. There certianly are interesting cases out there for certain. Finance, insurance, personal injury, corporate litigation, patents, trademarks, copywrites--all equal $$$...<br>  <br>  Family law--not so much<br>  Criminal law--not so much<br>  <br>  That all said--law degrees OPEN A LOT OF DOORS! And even if you did go to law school, got your degree did your year of articling and then worked for 2-5 yrs to pay off your loans and save money for your house--you'd have enough experience to keep you going throughout your life.<br>  <br>  I think lawyers make really interesting ppl as long as they were to start out with. If you become a lawyer because you hope to make $10K a day--chances are you'll kill yourself trying.<br>  <br>  Most articling students start at $50-60K but they work 80 hours a week! (Or close to it). Many articling students have been known to keep a toothbrush & a change of clothes at the office as they are there SO Much! Sometimes its too hard to go home in between days due to the work load.<br>  <br>  Almost ALL lawyers who were not partners, lived within a 30 minute walk to the firm because they were ALWAYS working! Most firms are downtown & that means higher rent.<br>  <br>  I would say that you CAN make a LOT of Money eventually & overall with such a job. Certianly I'm NOT disagreeing with that.<br>  <br>  However, are there other jobs that you may enjoy more and make less--most certainly. It's also a very high stress job and that's sometimes not worth the salary attached but that's something you can find out for yourself.

You're allowed to write your name/address on the check, so there is no issue with printing it. <br>  <br>  However, doing this is a waste of time. However receives the check will run it through a machine and will likely know that the check is temporary.<br>  <br>  I would just go to the bank and withdraw cash.

I know that at my bank, people's names and account numbers are frequently typed on to "counter checks" with a regular old typewriter, and that works just fine as far as the bank is concerned. It does not mean, however, that a merchant will accept them. (They do not have any confirmation that those checks actually belong to you.) <br>  <br>  Also, maybe you can just go to the bank and request a withdrawal? I am sure they will be glad to help you. If they don't, then you should change banks.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	About the only thing you can do with those check is pay the phone bill, cable bill and utility bill.<br>  <br>  Your bank should have given you a Debit Card... use that until you get your checks.<br>  <br>  Frankly... what do you need checks for anyway?

Trying earning money from your parents by doing chores or even selling some of their unneeded things on Ebay and charging a commission.

You will also need great references since you don't have work experience. Talk to teachers, counselors, clergy, coaches, club sponsors, and directors of places you have volunteered or people you have done casual labor for and ask them about giving you a reference. Get accurate, current contact information for them and ask them to be ready to get calls for references from potential employers.<br>  <br>  Remember:<br>  Most businesses are individually owned and operated so it is the owner’s policy and past experience with minors that will determine if they will hire you.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|IIpEaDCcaa	Publix, Albertson's, Winn-Dixie<br>  <br>  keep in mind that this may vary from place to place|`|k59o2PZaaa	If you're looking for a summer job and work near a Six Flags they hire 15 year olds.

To have the CHANCE to be a successful fashion designer you need lots of talent, connections, dedication, intelligence, and luck. As for the salary of a fashion designer, it varies A LOT you could be earning a petty 25,000 or millions each year. It's not a career path that you would choose just to be rich and famous, you would have better luck marrying a rich guy than becoming a famous fashion designer.

457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	Screenings for STDs are very rarely covered by health insurance.<br>  <br>  Before having the screenings done, you should call your insurance company to find out whether they would even cover the tests.<br>  <br>  If its not covered on your policy and you have it done, you'll be responsible for the full billed charges.  Which generally run anywhere from $300-$500.<br>  <br>  I used to work for a large health insurance company in the customer service department, and I'd get angry calls from parents all the time.  "My daughter just got a bill for $450 worth of lab work.  Why weren't the labs covered?  What kind of labs did she have?"  Of course, I couldn't actually tell them that their daughter had a bunch of STD screenings done that weren't covered on the policy.  So, I would have to tell them "Your daughter had screening lab work that was not a covered benefit on your policy.  Unfortunately, due to privacy laws, I cannot tell you what specific lab tests she had done.  If you'd like that information, you'll have to check with your daughter."  (Some of those fathers were awfully angry too - I'd hate to have been the daughter when they confronted them to find out what kind of "lab work" they had done.)<br>  <br>  Long story short...<br>  <br>  1)  Odds are these tests will not be covered by your health insurance company.<br>  <br>  2)  Whether they are covered or not, your insurance company can't tell your parents what specific lab tests you had done.  However, your parents may find out that you had lab work done (especially if the labs were rejected as non-covered).<br>  <br>  3)  You're better off getting the tests done through the health department, if you're paranoid about your parents finding out and/or don't want to have to pay the bill out of your pocket.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Any claims that are submitted to your parents BCBS MAY show up as an explanation of benefits to your parents home.

If the applicant does not meet your criteria, pass. Income should be at least 3 x rent, no evictions, no court judgments, no drug, sex or violent convictions of any kind, no collections, 2 years of positive landlord references, 2 years of stable employment, etc.<br>  <br>  If an application is not turned in fully completed, the applicant has just screened themselves out of your apartment. If an applicant does not want to provide you the info you require, you do not want that applicant as a tenant.<br>  <br>  If any of the info given on an application is untrue, the applicant has just screened themselves out of your apartment.<br>  <br>  You should do the free checks next. Most states have court records available online for free. You can also go to your local court house and run a check. Any evictions, Small Claims or civil claims judgments and the applicant is screened out.<br>  <br>  Some states have criminal records online, which can be searched for free. You need a full name and date of birth. If criminal checks are not available online, go to your local police station. The cost is minimal.<br>  <br>  Next would be the credit check.

ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	It depends on the type of sales job. If it is a retail sales job you will greet people and see if you can help them make a purchasing decision. You may also want to attempt to up sell them to something of more value or sell them other items which may compliment what they have already made a decision to buy. <br>  <br>  Route sales is where you run a weekly route and replenish current inventories and try to get your customers to try new products as they come available. They normally deal with retailers. Some of these people actually sell and deliver their own products. Route sales would include things such as soft drinks, beer, snacks such as peanuts, crackers, etc., bread and milk. These items are things which must be replenished on a regular basis. The route sales person will mostly see the same customers each week or so.<br>  <br>  I consider the professional sales person as one who does his own prospecting, qualifies his prospects, makes his presentation and closes the sale. He will likely service his own accounts but may not see them as often as the route salesman. Customers rarely come to him. He works a territory. His territory could be regional or national. Some salesmen work a vertical market such as all pharmacies or picture frame retailers or certain types of manufacturers like riding saddle manufacturers. This type of salesman plans at least a week or more as to where he will be working and how many calls per day or week he will make. <br>  <br>  The final type of salesman is the manufacturers representative. He may work with one or more manufacturers to sell their products in a certain area. He has his own company or works for a manufacturers representative firm. He could work a small or large territory. <br>  <br>  In all sales the salesman helps the customer to make a decision to purchase the product or service they are selling.

Heres the thing though: with the eco. kind of bad right now you might want to think about credit. If you must get one now, try a secured credit card with the bank you already have a relationship with. The only difference is with a secured you give the bank an amount say$500 and thats your credit limit , if you default or cant pay for any reason they pay off the card with that $ with an unsecured card your balance depends on how much they think you will be able to be responsible with and if you default its on you to find a way to pay. They both report to all three credit bureaus.|`|S0XRVANDaa	well one thing you dont want is a credit card in the long run it costs more money to use a credit card if you want a good score try getting a loan threw your bank start small like a $1000 and cell phone companys report too there are alot of ways to up your score without getting a credit card|`|eqJiIQGeaa	I think you should just wait till you buy your car...

l7fyLFFtaa	Working at camps is awesome. i have been in the camping industry for years and am currently the director of a great day camp. Unfortunately its not in your area. <br>  <br>  Most camps will not hire anyone under 18 years old to be a counselor. Some camps will hire 16 year olds to wash dishes and work in the kitchen. <br>  <br>  At most resident (sleep-away) camps 15 year olds are still campers. However, some resident camps and many, if not most, day camps have a CIT (counselor-in-training) program. This is where you help out the counselors with special events, activities, games, rounding up campers, etc. Basically you shadow the counselors and are their helpers. The idea is that you learn about being a leader and mentor shadowing them. You do not discipline campers and are never left alone with them.<br>  <br>  Some camps will do some leadership training with their CITs. This is what I did when I was a CIT. I have to tell you though, it is kind of like classroom work and can get pretty boring (depending on the program). These types of CIT programs are usually at resident camps, but at most day camps its not that way.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the short answer is, NO, you cannot be a counselor at 15. The good news is, you can be a CIT which is almost as good (if not better since you don't have to actual be responsible for the campers). The campers really look up to CITs. Of course you don't get paid, its either a volunteer position or you have to pay for the program. I will say though, you will have a blast being a CIT. I highly recommend it. Start looking now though before all the spots are taken.<br>  <br>  Check the local YMCAs and Parks and Recreation departments for local CIT opportunities.<br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|B1wBXvqyaa	no im almost certain they wont hire you but you can get hired to watch over kids and stuff

And why should your parents take such a negative view about "gays" and prosecuting you for such leanings ... since as we well know, isn't being gay a biological inherited condition which your parent are possibly partially to blame.

ZFo3XOURaa	Housing prices in most of the country will fall further this year. In some areas they will fall further than others. I believe you should be ok waiting to buy your home through most of the year but if you choose not to buy pior to December 31 2009 you will for sure be out 8k that is being offered in the Obama stimulus plan. You will also loose out on excellent interest rates. Right now interest rates are around 5.375% and the historical average is around 8.5%. And for each 0.5% interest rates rise the price of a property would have to fall 2.5% to keep the monthly payment the same. This means that prices would have to fall 15% to make up for interest rates returning to the historical average and they will towards the end of this recession.|`|Hzj6vBKhaa	I think we're pretty close, may drop a little more but will prolly hit bottom the end of this year.

QX3KiSxyaa	Hi--first if I were you, I'd find a local youth centre or even find a successful youth centre & travel or email or call them to talk to them about their experiences.<br>  <br>  You want to fully understand every single thing they have ever had to deal with. It's important to realize that you'll most likely be asking for public funding which is limited & has always been limited to youths.<br>  <br>  THEN do this:<br>  Another idea would be to start with your local community watch group or police station and ask them what they feel would help the community most. They are the ones out & around, they are the ones who will help build your case to the government about the need for such a centre--which usually work off the requirement to "keep youths out of trouble".<br>  <br>  Find out from organizations such as the YWCA or the YMCA & Boys & Girls Clubs--if they have any positions volunteer or paid to help you learn your practical skills set to help you get to this pt.<br>  <br>  Also you'll want to take courses in drug addiction, suicide prevention and other such "not so happy side of life" courses so you can deal with that sort of thing--something that will probably occur when dealing with "youth". You never know who's children you'll end up taking care of :{.<br>  <br>  It's SUCH a great idea, LOFTY but AMAZING! & I think you should GO FOR IT! But expect it to take a good many years! Realize you'll have to work with MANY community groups along the way. You'll need Everyone support!<br>  <br>  Plus realize that SO many of these places work off "board of directors" and they are volunteer positions not usually paid work.<br>  <br>  Plus you probably won't get paid much for your amount of time & effort that you'll put out.<br>  <br>  "CEO" is such an "old school" business term however I understand what you mean behind the word. That you want to be in charge & that you want it to be yours.<br>  <br>  Youth centres in general are owned & helped run by COMMUNITIES.<br>  <br>  It's always that 1 person's idea--and that 1 person is DESPERATELY needed to do that! To get the ball rolling! <br>  <br>  Then a grant proposal needs to be written & supported by community leaders. <br>  <br>  If granted--you have money but do you have a hall? A place to "house" said centre? Once you get that--you need a board of directors if not before hand.<br>  <br>  Everyone has a job on the board--someone is the secretary, someone else does marketing & PR, someone else makes sure the building is solid, safe & yours to use, someone else does accounting, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  But each board of directors does need a leader--but they are elected--and may not be you--not a bad thing after the first few years. You may decide by then you'd rather be a program director or the main contact person and let other ppl be in charge of all the "hassles".<br>  <br>  It's a HUGE MOMENT-AS JOB that you're taking on!<br>  <br>  God love you for it!

Tl82rbtZaa	Definately. First of all, have you contacted the club owner to let them know about the mistake?...If so and they were of no help go to your bank or whoever issued you the debitcard. All you have to do is explain that you want to fill out an Affidavit of Unauthorized Debitcard Activity. Explain to them that you contacted the club and the outcome...and that you paid cash and had only used the card to hold the reservation etc etc. Be quick about it though, you only have 60 days from the date of the charge if it's a mastercard or visa card to dispute the charge. Anyways, once you report it to your bank they should take care of it. One more precaution I would do is close that card and request a new one....just to keep that from happening again.|`|L9wHaNiBaa	You need proof you paid cash for the same service and a bank statement for the other charge. But typically a mistake is a mistake and they should put the cash back in your account electronically or give you the cash. So Yes|`|1HLIKuTvaa	I assume you used a "debit" card as a visa or mastercard based on how you wrote your question (otherwise you had to share your PIN...).  <br>  <br>  The answer is you can dispute the charge exactly like you would if it were a credit card.  Call your financial institution.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	How did they get your card number if you already paid cash?  Or did you use your card to make the reservation and then pay cash when you got there?  You should probably take it up with the club.
3mAgM405aa	Because of your lack of knowledge and experience on how table reservations are disbursed; you got caught up with an unscrupulous club promoter who was essentially deceitfully and took your money without rendering any actual service.  Should you know where the promoter lives, you can serve him with a complaint after filing the necessary papers at your small claims court.  He'll have to explain why he charged you and what's his authorization for doing so.  Merely having the issues addressed in a court of law is enough to cause the promoter to be fearful and have second thoughts... even to move him to not show up at the hearing.  And should he fail to appear, you will be granted a default summary judgment which you can then serve on him to recoup your original payout.  Again, you have a good case against the promoter; not the club owner.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1NWjta2jaa	The easy way is to call the card company and tell them you want to dispute charges.

eACZ1Rhjaa	You are lucky if you break even, if you had a huge route with experienced technicians you can make money but just owning a few you may pay more for repairs and transporting the machines than you make.<br>  <br>  I did the accounting for a vending company once that made a nice profit but they paid the workers about 3 times minimum wage. The workers knew how to repair and take scrap machines apart for parts.<br>  <br>  Where I work now we get vending machine owners in, the frozen food don't work long then sit empty and moldy until they haul them away. They have to stock the candy and chip machine about daily so assuming you sold 100 items a day at 75 cent and paid 45 cents for the product you would make a gross profit of $30. Some days nobody is working like weekends and holidays or when we lay a lot of people off so you would be lucky to gross $150 a week. After paying payments on your machine and the price of fuel to get to the supplier and then fill the machine you wouldn't get much for your time. Broken machines would cost you to repair.

SeB1apyzaa	The durability and engine power of tractors made them very suitable for engineering tasks. Tractors can be fitted with engineering tools such as dozer blade, bucket, hoe, ripper, and so on. The most common attachments for the front of a tractor are dozer blade or a bucket. When attached with engineering tools the tractor is called an engineering vehicle.<br>  A bulldozer is a track-type tractor attached with blade in the front and a rope-winch behind. Bulldozers are very powerful tractors and have excellent ground-hold, as their main tasks are to push or drag things.<br>  Bulldozers have been further modified over time to evolve into new machines which are capable of working in ways that the original bulldozer can not. One example is that loader tractors were created by removing the blade and substituting a large volume bucket and hydraulic arms which can raise and lower the bucket, thus making it useful for scooping up earth, rock and similar loose material to load it into trucks.<br>  A front-loader or loader is a tractor with an engineering tool which consists of two hydraulic powered arms on either side of the front engine compartment and a tilting implement. This is usually a wide open box called a bucket but other common attachments are a pallet fork and a bale grappler.<br>  Other modifications to the original bulldozer include making the machine smaller to let it operate in small work areas where movement is limited. There are also tiny wheeled loaders, officially called Skid-steer loaders but nicknamed "Bobcat" after the original manufacturer, which are particularly suited for small excavation projects in confined areas.

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey.

That would have had instructions on how to disperse assets.  If not, you are going to have to jump through the hoops.  Just realize that its most likely going to happen quickly, and they are most likely following the rules that they have set for themselves.  If your name isnt on the stocks, they want to make very sure that they are not transferring stocks that shouldnt be transferring.  That would be a major law-breaker and could get them shut down.  That is why they are being so careful and picky.

Les règles concernant le licenciement ne s'appliquent pas. Toutefois, la rupture ne peut être fondée sur un motif discriminatoire ; et si elle est fondée sur un motif disciplinaire, l'employeur doit respecter la procédure disciplinaire.<br>  <br>  Donc la rupture ne doit pas avoir lieu, pour moi. Surtout si l'employeur donne une fausse raison lors de la rupture de la période d'essai. <br>  Ton cas est particulier je ne peux que me référer aux textes de lois et la loi dit que la période d'essai peut etre rompue librement.

f3c5e64c49fc8e39fccbb756caea9dcdaa	Allora, sono tutte e 2 società di capitali, ma ci sono molte differenze. Le principali sono queste:<br>  <br>  Nelle società per azioni i soci rispondono limitatamente al capitale conferito, ovvero alle loro azioni. Il limite minimo di una spa è di 120.000 euro. Le spa possono emettere azioni e obbligazioni.<br>  <br>  Nella srl il capitale sociale non è ripartito in azioni, ma in quote. Il limite minimo perchè esista una srl è di 10.000 euro. Le srl possono emettere obbligazioni. Anche qua la responsabilità è limitata alla quota conferita.<br>  <br>  Diciamo che la Spa è il tipo di società piu grande, piu importante tra i tipi di società di capitali.<br>  Tutte le altre differenze non posso spiegarle qui.. Se ti interessa saperle in modo approfondito, procurati un libro di diritto commerciale. <br>  <br>  ps: comunque le spa non sono necessariamente quotate in borsa (come ha scritto qualcuno sopra).<br>  Ciao|`|26a099e2e26aa020898398b15cffa42eaa	spa= societa per azioni.E' una societa quotata in borsa dove dei soci azionisti ne comprano o vendono le azioni in base alle quotazioni borsistiche.<br>  srl=societa responsabilita limitata: Due o piu soci titolari di un'azienda in caso di fallimento non ne rispondono con il loro patrimonio personale ma rischiano solo fino al valore dell'azienda stessa.|`|8e0cf41fd84bc22b9e3a2cad272ecc88aa	solo per completezza aggiungo alla ottima risposta data da x_kellyol... e a ragion veduta essendo un amministratore di società che i soci sia di una srl che di una spa possono rispondere con capitali propri, al di la del capitale sociale, se hanno prestato garanzie e fidejussioni personali a favore di banche o compagnie assicuratrici per ottenere un fido da una banca (in genere superiore al capitale sociale) o per essere supportati in un contratto che preveda cauzioni|`|feefe18c526bf14bc749315794bb7343aa	s.p.a. significa società per azioni ed è formata da azionisti che posseggono appunto azioni quaotate in borsa mentre una s.r.l. è generalmente una società più piccola formata da 1 o 2 persone che non rischiano il capitale proprio.x quanto riguarda la scissione di una società nella s.p.a. se la dividono in base al n di azioni possedute. spero che le mie riminiscenze scolastiche ti siano utili e che siano corrette! baci|`|06d0b6284bcaaa139de454f87769cde5aa	Nella s.p.a. i soci risondono con i patrimoni privati alle perdite dell' azienda.<br>  La s.r.l. la responsabilità dei soci è limitata al capitale versato
f22b3033edaff8e5a2fac6289399b9fbaa	visto che lavoro in banca ti do alcune informazioni.<br>  Innanzitutto devi specificare se intendi aprire un conto valutario residenti (cioè tu sei cittadino italiano) o un conto valutario non residenti (cioè tu non sei italiano).<br>  La differenza non è da poco in quanto il regime fiscale è diverso. <br>  Se tu infatti sei straniero in italia non ti vengono applicate le imposte (27% sugli interessi) ma ti danno il lordo e sarà tua cura dichiarare i proventi nel paese dove effettui la dichiarazione dei redditi. Viceversa, se sei italiano, ogni anno in dichiarazione dei redditi devi indicare gli eventuali proventi differenza cambi realizzati e pagarci le tasse.<br>  <br>  Detto questo l'apertura di un conto valutario non ha costi differenti rispetto ad un conto corrente normale. Il tasso di interesse è evidentemente calcolato sui tassi della valuta di riferimento (per esempio il tasso del dollaro è un po' più alto).<br>  In teoria, dico, molto in teoria, i servizi connessi al conto sono uguali a quelli  di un conto corrente normale. Cosa significa: che si può emettere un bancomat ma io sudo già all'idea di doverlo fare in quanto sono più che convinto che alla fine non ci riesco (le procedure fanno decisamente pena).<br>  E' chiaro che sui prelevamenti bancomat dovrai pagare una tasso di cambio che ragionevolmente ogni banca modifica a suo vantaggio.<br>  Una domanda: a cosa ti serve un conto in dollari? Solo per acquistare dollari da tenere lì ed eventualmente rivendere ad un cambio più favorevole? Se così è, a mio giudizio non ti serve un conto in dollari ma ti serve un fondo monetario espresso in usd. Sono investimenti che, investono in bond governativi a breve termine espressi in dollari. Danno il tasso di interesse di un bot americano diciamo e in più sono a rischio cambio cioè, se il dollaro si apprezza guadagni la differenza sul cambio.<br>  Oppure hai dei dollari in mano che non vuoi cambiare perchè in questo momento non è favorevole farlo. Allora qua ti conviene tenerli in mano almeno non paghi spese.<br>  Il conto, a mio giudizio, serve alle aziende che operano con l'estero e lo usano soprattutto per fare operazioni di copertura sui cambi (cambi a termine, swaps, options, etc etc)<br>  Tieni conto di una cosa. le previsioni sul dollaro da qua a 3 mesi parlano di un cambio a 1.32 circa.

AA10464818	Here are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: <br>  <br>  1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.<br>  <br>  2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!<br>  <br>  Recommend Site Scripts (various) <a href="http://php.resourceindex.com/Complete_Scripts/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/" rel="nofollow">http://php.resourceindex.com/Complete_Sc...</a><br>  Big Nose Bird Recommend this Site <a href="http://bignosebird.com/carchive/birdcast.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://bignosebird.com/carchive/birdcast...</a> <br>  CGI Resource Index <a href="http://cgi.resourceindex.com/Programs_and_Scripts/Perl/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.resourceindex.com/Programs_an...</a><br>  Hostscripts <a href="http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/Site_Recommendation/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_an...</a><br>  <br>  3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.<br>  <br>  If you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day." <a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/201...</a> <br>  <br>  4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html</a><br>  <a href="http://i-newswire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://i-newswire.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/add.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pr.com/press-releases" rel="nofollow">http://www.pr.com/press-releases</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prfree.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theopenpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theopenpress.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.przoom.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.przoom.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prweb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.prweb.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newswiretoday.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswiretoday.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.free-press-release.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-press-release.com/</a><br>  <br>  5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.<br>  <br>  Here is a comprehensive list of where to submit your articles <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AhzreGmnCUicOoyedqypscUjzKIX?qid=1006022407481">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=...</a><br>  <br>  6.

Usually companies charge hundreds of dollars to simply pull your credit and send correctly worded dispute letters—this is the key…..people will tell you that you can do this yourself for free but the truth of the matter is that the credit bureaus will throw your letters away or simply reject them.  There is an easy to use online kit that will deliver the results you want available for just $19.95 at the source website.  A similar kit is being sold via infomercials and radio talk shows for seventy dollars more but they try to solicit you repeatedly for other services after the fact.|`|0bff142a0602f4632f3f296f090bb501aa	30 days.

g9F8NFmIaa	It certainly depends on where. Prices are lower and inventory is higher, but theywill eventually go up, as will rates. That's the thing that makes this a good time to buy, rates are still good, that makes a big difference in the big picture. With summer time approaching, that's peak buying season, so prices will start to go up a bit.|`|ieNPpJr1aa	if interest rates are low and you are a qualified buyer than it's a good time to buy.|`|b58e222af3e2f0779ed8b08c564ff80faa	It's really an impossible question to answer.  If Tampa is experiencing employment growth and inmigration, you are probably pretty safe.  Just don't expect those eye popping value increases of the bubble days.  If the value of your house goes up 2-5% per year that's pretty good.|`|8aff3273c58f79ec9f50dd00e90f9e7aaa	I don't know specifically about Tampa, but most markets are having similar symptoms right now.  I am a builder, and things seem to have stagnated as far as prices go.  The biggest problem was that everything appreciated way to fast, and the cost of living did not keep up.  People couldn't afford to own anything anymore, and prices stagnated or slid to compensate.  Couple that with the fact that speculators were flipping houses at ridiculous rates, and the overpriced market became flooded with homes - way more than there were buyers.  If you look around, people are still buying homes, even in the same numbers in many areas, but there is a 6-7 month supply in most markets, nearly double the economically beneficial 3-4 month suppy.  In my estimation, these items make now as good a time as any to buy.  Interest rates are still comparatively low, record foreclosures have lenders bending over backwards for qualified buyers, and buyers own the market, not sellers.  Your house may not appreciate at record rates the way they did a few years ago, but it will appreciate, especially after the cost of living corrects itself and people can afford to buy again.  Except for the past eight years or so, real estate has never been a short term investment anyhow.  It all boils down the the most basic of economics - supply and demand.  Over abundant supply puts the buyer in a great position!|`|AA11591142	There is no guarantee prices will go down, but I can guarantee they will go up eventually, given the continuous rise in population and erosion of the value of the dollar. Interest rates are relatively low, so now is a good time to buy.
KH9jQLIhaa	No, you don't really need friends to introduce to to jobs that provide good prospects and promotion, just like you don't "NEED" a billion dollars, but wouldn't it be nice to have?<br>  <br>  Like it has been said, "better to have and not need than to need and not have!"|`|ad0825ae5cbc73af1fce87d4ab639149aa	Not sure of that. However, I have heard that getting a job through networking is the most easiest way. Normally, you can skip the formal interview and maybe get hire with just your friends' recommendations.<br>  <br>  However, it also means you have a greater part to show you live up to the expectations. After all, if you fail to perform, your friend gets implicated as well.

You could even take some courses somewhere else if you can afford it. I found that one of the limiting factors was the cost of the software that you need to do the animations.|`|l4Rbb8Q5aa	If changing schools is not an option, and your school has an art or communications department that offers classes in graphic design applications such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Flash or video editing, enroll in a few of those. It's the long way around, but those apps are usually the foundation before 3D and broadcast design apps.<br>  <br>  What you really need to do is get yourself into a school in California, USA that offers full bachelor's degrees in the field. There is also a cluster of schools in Vancouver BC, Canada. If you are in Europe, the University of Brighton offers excellent programs as well. France has notable programs as well. If you are in Asia, I imagine Japan is full of cutting edge computer animation study programs.

That's a government default, and government doesn't report until it's bad.<br>  <br>  You can write all three credit bureaus and explain it, and they have to include your explanation.  Or frankly, you can pay the state fee finally and see that it gets removed.

What's left over is deductible.  If the total is less than 2% of your income, there's nothing left to deduct.<br>  <br>  THEN - if you still have an amount that you can deduct - it goes on your Schedule A...itemized deductions.  If your total itemized deductions are less than your standard deductions - then you're better off not itemizing and just take the standard.<br>  <br>  So for a lot of folks...employee expenses either do not exceed 2% of their income - or they don't have enough other deductions to make itemizing a good idea.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	You cannot.  In order to file, you would have to itemize your expenses instead of taking the Standard Deduction.<br>  <br>  The Standard Deduction is much greater than any amount you would be allowed to claim as a business expense because those expenses are limited by your income.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why the employer "requires" her to travel to people's homes and will not reimburse that travel.  It doesn't sound right to me.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	In order to claim mileage, you have to have enough deductions to itemize. If you do not have a home loan, or do not owe much on it, you apparently come out ahead taking the standard deduction.<br>  <br>  You would need at least $10,900 in deductions to itemize, since that is standard deduction for a couple.|`|Pm7EHLARaa	If she is W2 employee:<br>  This deduction is itemized deduction.

eACZ1Rhjaa	It means an amount that makes a difference. <br>  For example capitalizing assets. A asset is furniture, buildings, equipment or vehicles that will last over one year. So when you start a business you capitalize the original purchases and depreciate the assets. <br>  Some assets that will last a year or more like a waste basket aren't worth the trouble of depreciating and tracking them even if one might last 20 years.<br>  An audit might find you should have capitalized some assets but the auditor declare the error isn't material if it doesn't make much difference. <br>  A big company like Boeing might not capitalize a desk that cost $1,000 where a one person office might. It would be a material asset to the smaller company but just another expense to Boeing.|`|hMR0aVVAaa	in accounting, it is about how significant an amount is...or significant enough to affect a company's evaluation or decision..for example a miscellaneous expense amounting to $ 500 in a company which incurs overall operating expense of say $ 1 000 000, relatively speaking, the amount of 500 compared to 1M is deemed insignificant or 'immaterial' that there is no need for you to disclose it in a financial statement..if you have an expense amounting to $ 150 000 then you have to disclose that amount because it is material.. I do hope that you're referring to an accounting definition of materiality..:)

I really, really thought I wanted to go to school in New York City, but when I did a tour of NYU, I instantly realized that it wasn't for me. I knew the second I stepped onto the campus of another school, that that's where I wanted to go. I'm not saying it will be that instantaneous for you, but I think it's really, really important, and will help you make this decision for yourself. Good luck!|`|LRbWZhvnaa	AWAY FROM HOME.

Unless you went to a dental technology trade school, it's unlikely that you'll spend much time your first year or so in college studying much other than basic core requirements anyway. Just the experience of college life on your own will inspire you to decide a career path.<br>  <br>  Dental medicine would be a more secure and stable career path. Graphic design is much more exciting and a lot more fun but employment is a roller-coaster ride. Every time the economy goes south, creatives are the first to be laid-off. As for HR management, I know a whole lot of HR folks that have been laid off and are having difficulties finding work. With graphic design, one can always freelance until the next job comes along<br>  <br>  As to community college vs 4-year universities, statistics have shown there is no difference in education quality for students who spent 2 years in community college transferring to a 4 year college. Community college is more nuts and bolts. Show up. Go to class. Attend a few extra-curricular activities and study. 4 year college is an experience of total immersion, and for me, was the only option I would consider.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck.<br>  kmr|`|d4af98bef4634072715e0b3c20d8beefaa	When going to college I would recommend that you go to a college AWAY from home. that way you will figure out what to do with your life.

eACZ1Rhjaa	Go to the bank and talk to them first thing Monday. Try to explain what happened and what you are doing to be sure it never happens again. Get the money Monday even if you have to borrow it from someone or get a payday loan. The overdraft fees and then a daily fee might end up costing you $120 if nothing else clears before payday. This is one of the few times I would suggest a payday loan it might cost you $25 to borrow $100 for 4 days but save you 80 or more.

P87DeizZaa	The plain answer is NO.  If you are talking about jobs where your employer gave you a W-2 at the end of the year, then the IRS knows that you earned the income.  The bottom line is this--legally you are required to report "income" in the year it is earned. <br>  <br>  If you "forgot" to include income from a certain W-2, then it is basically a roll of the dice if the IRS flags your return or not.

kho74FORaa	Downtown LA is a very big place. If you are in the area of Wilshire for example, you could pay anywhere from 2500 to 8000 dollars/month. In Korea or China town, anywhere from 1500- 3000 dollars/month. It really depends on where in LA that you are looking and if you are looking for furnished or unfurnished. Bottom line is, you can expect to pay more money the closer you go west from downtown center, less going due south and more heading north. If you are going east, you will probably not want to go live regardless of how much it costs.....|`|AA12010102	You need to go to craigslist.org and see what the current rental rates are. This is a great website and many people will often include photos of the property. Monthly rent is going to depend on many things, including how old is the home, has it been upgraded recently, what is the exact neighborhood its in, etc. Also, rental prices have been coming down slightly in many areas... so keep this in mind. You can also go to the major rental company websites like Archstone.com and see if they have apartments in your area. They are very competitive and this will also give you a good idea of what rent prices are. Their prices can also change daily... depending on how many days the unit has been vacant.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

There are a lot of programs out there for first time home buyers. Also have your credit checked, if it's bad clean it up. You need to make a good impression on the bank. I would shop around for a loan officer before you choose. Be specific about what your needs are like closets, garage, busy streets, things like that. Be honest, if you don't like the home say so, because you have to live there. I hope this imformation is  useful to you. Good Luck.|`|c1ab66176eebc0123398fe4d6446339baa	1. Get pre-approved.<br>  2.

Don't neglect the annual "Bibles" of the working writer, Writer's Market and/or Fiction Writer's Market [both annual; both from Writer's Digest].

The minute you give them your credit card and personal information you have now opened your computer to unwanted cookies on your hard drive, annoying pop-up windows and if you are on a PC you open your computer to viruses that can wipe you out.<br>  <br>  A lot of work to collect the "reward payments" that payout is not worth the effort over time. You will need to sign up for many types of offers, most of which require you to use a credit card. You start a week trial service with varies types of businesses or services, such as, an Internet service provider, book club, credit monitoring service, etc. to get your reward. If you don't cancel the trial, you end up being charged for the service and each service has different rules about how and when you can cancel. Very cumbersome!<br>  <br>  Since you will need to sign up for at least a dozen offers before you get to $100 in rewards, it's very easy to forget what you have signed up for, or the problems you will have canceling in time to to be charged the full amount. The Cash Create recruiters you see here over exaggerate how much money you can earn because once you've done the high-dollar trials ($8-10 each), you are left with small rewards of a dollar or two. The survey business is not an efficient way to make money and you are more than likely to loose money in the end.|`|483e1ea94df14d3af6c998975d077d6daa	Depends where, how many hours, etc.|`|807602a6204aafc4f5dd20798866391faa	not much you could train a monkey to cut hair|`|9e6577fa4c7605c124ba14e4c854879daa	anywhere between ￡70 and ￡100 roughly<br>  not very well paid is hair and beauty, thats why it helps when people tip!|`|df084e1cddef40897f75ed3d281310d3aa	it all depends on how qualified they are, and how many people they have had their haircuts / coloured as most of it its based on commission - hope this helps

77cdf09dcf79edd6fc4d43e1c87004edaa	I would still give a notice.  See if you cannot get your new employer to start you one day later; explain to them that you are currently on a temporary assignment and you would like to give them a days notice to be fair.  Most places will accept this; it shows that you are responsible and are not out to just up and leave on a whim.  <br>  <br>  Also, what if you need this agency for another position in the future? or for a reference?  Try and give them the additional day that they are asking-  don't burn any bridges.<br>  <br>  Definitely put it into writing and thank them for the opportunity; as the company is more apt to give you a good reference when they report back to the temporary agency.  Since it is a temp position, they should understand as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck with you new position.|`|892d3e41c3c90a7ab7da534281e8ede3aa	Be truthful.  Tell them that some time ago you applied for this position and that it has been offered to you to accept in a very short time span of two days.  Explain that you have always given sufficient notice when ending an assignment however, they have not left you with that option to do this since this offer is very time sensitive.  You don't want to miss the opportunity that has been offered to you. Tell them this is a career move that you have waited a long time for.|`|a44401a5ad3ece1cd01a105d1f1b8a77aa	To tell your supervisor at the temp job is no problem.  Tell them plainly that your last day is whatever.  Temping works both ways.  Its easy to get a temp worker to start and equally easy for the temp to bail out.<br>  <br>  Telling your temp agency supervisor is another thing.  Make sure its ok.  Some temp agencies will put you on the back burner if you do this.  Sometimes you won't get more assignments.<br>  <br>  So don't worry about the people you're reporting to.  remember, they're not paying any benefits for you.  Don't feel bad about leaving, its your right.  Just make sure you handle the situation with the agency correctly.

09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	Be very careful!  I asked a similar question and received many answers; unfortunately, I could not decide from the answers which jobs were legitimate and which were not.  I was warned about survey sites (e.g., treasure trooper and cash crate); I was told that if you sign with them, your email will become swamped by requests for surveys.  Additionally, the surveys do not actually pay very often and request personal information which you might not care to give.  Many of the on-line companies require you to pay a fee or ask you to buy or sell products, so are questionable in my opinion.  In fact, by the time I had investigated the answers that I received, plus having visited sites on my own, including several who provided scam warnings (for instance, never become involved with any organization which wants you to transfer money or checks), I tended to agree with the answerer who advised me that 98% of all on-line career offers are scams.  You are quite young, too, so that if your age becomes known, there will be many unethical scammers hungering to take advantage of you.|`|c96dac2e1de0d7d694b624a0a64bc846aa	check this site man|`|9b1b6b7a9bc7be4d47ea1d5da30e4f6eaa	You could write articles,sell on eBay,make a website,take surveys.

When I mention Leveraging, I mean to partner with as many organizations and businesses that have the venue to reach your desired clients/customers in a large scale consistantly. You want to take advantage of the latest trends like text messaging and use e-commerce in many different areas to get your organization noticed. Partner with companies that have a customer/client base that is primarily already on the internet, and develop your organization to be part of their search engines. For example, with my company, other businesses like The ESPN Store, Best Buy, and Circut City (just to name a few) have partnered with my site because every person that is a business partner with me has additional sites which reach in many different states and countries. The companies see the power of the internet, and bid for prime real estate on my site and the sites of my business partners. This gets them the exposure they need to reach the e-commerce consumers at a much faster and cheaper rate than going the ways of developing their own site and just having that. You reach a larger audience if you become a part of other e-businesses search engines.

b9e2bb5a25c57cc333a03588822952e8aa	I live in New Jersey and used to be a loan officer, so I've had a lot of experience looking at housing contracts that people have used as a source of income to get a loan.  In the state of New Jersey, any type of rental contract is not allowed to be for longer than 365 days.  The contract should be renewed on a yearly basis, and re-signed, if renting for longer than a year.  If your friend signed to a one-year contract, the landlord can (and should) hold her to it.  If the contract didn't state specific dates, it wouldn't hold up in court.  You, as the sublettee, are off the hook completely, if you want to be.  Good luck!

SIRI is still rated as a hold and this is centering around the whole merger thing. But Chrysler just announced that they will be "first to market" with Sirius backseat TV. And Ford has just announced that they are making Sirius a standard option in Lincolns in addition to already doing so in many of their other makes and models.<br>  <br>  So it's all a waiting game. No big gains as of yet and one could lose all of one's money on it or it could truly take off by years end. Then again the share price is only $3.11 right this second. So even if you bought 100 shares or less if it tanked you would not be out much but with a chance to make some..... which appears to be likely at this point. <br>  <br>  Especially since they are going to start offering TV. Plus eventually people will demand remote access to the net and video. The cell companies try but it's not working. The only way to offer this will be via satellite. And Sirius and XM are the only two companies set up to do this even down to the retail level. Plus Apple, media companies, etc. will want to buy or partner with them rather than trying to build from the ground up.

0b09e77e84e77844850e09ff87b52905aa	There are some staff pharmacy jobs that are mainly inputting, making IVs and checking orders.  But, pharmacy is a diverse field.  I'm in management now but I still staff every 10-14 days to keep current.  When staffing I would read and input orders, counsel patients, provide information to nurses and MDs, make IVs, prepare drugs during resuscitations(very stressful), evaluate drug therapy and make interventions.  It can be monotonous at times.  But, most days it's interesting.   In a hospital you do not just count pills.  Most items in a hospital are unit dose items.  We sent up enough for 24 hrs.  Techs get all that stuff ready and you check it.  Depending on your duties, it can be a small part of your day. Now, clinical pharmacist do much less or no inputting.  They spend a lot of time counseling, providing information, doing inservices, DUEs,etc... They do more with drug information in greater depth than staff pharmacist.  They usually round with the MDs, although staff pharmacist do as well.  They usually have students and teach classes.   <br>  Pharmacy can be boring, but does not have to be.  Most people that say it's dreary have no idea what they are talking about.  They have no idea what a pharmacist does.  In fact, many hospital staff have no idea what pharmacist do day to day.  I've always thought that retail pharmacy would be dreary and stressful.  But, I have a cousin that has been doing it for years.  I reserve judgement as I haven't done it that much.

Everyone of us is born with both side of the coin; that is, the positive and negative side of us. We are born into this world with at least some level of intelligence and gifts, if not alot, so it is up to us to develop them. Whatever gifts or talents are we have been given when we were born are for the purpose of ensuring our basic survival when we become independent so that our parents can be discharged from their duty of financing us and the responsibilities of having to maintain us financially. In order to be able to know what one's own potential is, he/she will have to expose himself/herself to different things and environment. Even social life also plays a part. We must explore our own self to guage what are the gifts and talents we have in ourselves by taking up different challenges and also by exposing ourselves to different situations and problems in life. Challenges in life are meant to mold and strengthen us as for every hurdle we overcome we will become a more stronger. smarter and wiser person. Through that we can grow be become  a better persom in many expect. We will also realise the values of the things in our lives and also the purpose & meaning of life. With that we can also edify other people in return we earn respect and gain a sense of satisfaction which money cannot buy. We will continue to grow as learning is a on-going process and for as long as we live, we do not "graduate"  from the "big classroom" (this world). We will only "graduate" when we kick the bucket. <br>  <br>  Back to the two sides of the coin again, since we are made up of both the positive and negative sides, why choose to look at only the negative side of yourself?....right? No one is born a "single-sided coin". It is only a matter of which side is more clear-cut, that's all.<br>  <br>  As the saying goes, "You are what you think" so choose what'ss positive because positive thoughts attract positivity and the same is true for negative thought.<br>  <br>  Give it a thought....list down whatever your mind has about yourself and then use two difference colour highlighter to highlight what's positive and negative, your strength and weaknesses, your skills availability and lackage. You'll soon find that the answers lies in nowhere and with nobody except in yourself. <br>  <br>  I know it's a little long-winded but I'm sure it's detailed. Just a sincere sharing. Hope you'll find it beneficial.

AA11298150	go to walgreen <br>  or a walmart|`|uw3J8M0waa	Here is a short list of jobs which you can create  to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Become a "poser" who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions. "Posers" carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums. Again, contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners, accordingly. The hourly pay is around $10-$12 per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities.<br>  <br>  3. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  5. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  6. Become a proxy/stand-in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home/apartment. Acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor. Charge $1 per each package handled by you.<br>  <br>  7. Consider becoming a restaurant-cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants-cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers. Whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list, you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time. And when their name/assigned number comes up; you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served. The call back fee is usually around $0.50 cents on a per head basis. For example, a couple would be charged $1.00 while children under 6 would not be charged. Placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant -- often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system. You realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile. The restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison.<br>  <br>  8. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3JIqhBmZaa	You're very limited.

AA11966821	Medical transcriptionist requires superb command of English and of very technical medical terminology.  Medical transcriptionists will, for example, transcribe pathologists' reports dictated during autopsies, medical technologists' test results, radiologists' reports, doctors' reports.  Listening comprehension must be excellent, and you need good computer skills (Word especially), plus know how to use the Dictaphone and other transcription systems.  Non-native speakers are unlikely to have such a solid command of English plus the listening comprehension skills to transcribe the spoken word accurately as well as rapidly.    You will also need extensive experience in a doctor's office, laboratory or hospital for experience, references, and referrals before you can strike out on your own and get freelance work.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	It doesn't matter if English is not your first language as long as you are fluent in it.

Giardino di proprietà) previa richiesta di subalterno catastale se non registrata al catasto con una propria autonoma particella e subalterno.<br>  Se io ho acquistato una pertinenza, anche successivamente al Cespite principale, nello stesso o meno fabbricato (max 500 metri di distanza?) ho creato un VINCOLO di Pertinenza; Si può eliminare questo vincolo pagando le Tasse dovute ovvero la differenza fra le Tasse dovute e quelle pagare in agevolazione "prima casa".<br>  Il motivo è semplice perchè se così non fosse, ogni cinque anni, potrei vendere una pertinenza (acquistata con le agevolazioni "prima casa") ed acqustarne un'altra con gli stessi benefici.

You can get it at an used book store - or Amazon.<br>  <br>  Warning:  Jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST!!!  Law is NOT a good field to invest in!!!  Reasons?  We simply have WAY TOO MANY lawyers, very bad economy, today too many people think (mistakenly)  they can do their own legal work thanks to the Internet, law schools today are churning out WAY TOO MANY graduates for the economy and demand - but the law schools won't tell you this - law students are easy money for them.<br>  <br>  So even IF you do make it through law school, you probably won't be able to find a job.  There are MANY attorneys today working as paralegals and secretaries just to keep their bills paid.<br>  <br>  Suggestion:  Go into the field of Healthcare!!!!  There are LOTS of good jobs there!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|w9EQcmQ4aa	There are lots of fields you could get into with a law degree.

They built a very large business very quickly by doing the following...    1. Find a business or home that's fairly large.   2. Offer to mow it for free (yes free, you'll see why in a second) and do a GREAT job. Trim, blow off clippings etc.  3. Quote them a moderate to moderate/high price since they can now see the awesome quality you do.   4. Arrange a specific day/time to come and do their lawn or business.  5. Subcontract some help for as cheap as you can, leaving yourself a decent profit. It's best if you can get 3 - 5 guys to help for an hourly rate (just above minimum wage).  6. At the appointed time/day descend on the lawn with your crew like locusts. The goal is to get the job done quickly with the same quality.  7. Repeat and schedule 6-8 jobs per day. You will have some massive volume quickly.    The people I know that did this plan would send out 2 guys to do the work and give the quote. These two guys would do this 6 days a week arranging the work and scheduling everything. Then they would have a crew of about 10 - 12 guys knock out the lawns in a fraction of the time. These guys would do about $5-6K per day from the volume. Yes, a decent amount of the money went to pay their crews but they still made a mad money. In fact, they do so well that they only work 9 months a year and take the rest off.     Now a couple of warnings. You need to stay on top of your crew, budget for income and expenses and keep up with payroll (this can be outsourced).   Whatever you do, start small but have a big goal in mind and work towards it. There is nothing better than the young but patient entrepreneur.    I hope this helps.

Although it may seem like you're the only one that needs the income, you might find that some of your friends may be willing to help. I had a friend 2 summers ago that started his own lawn business and after 3 or 4 summers of mowing, trimming, raking, shoveling, digging, etc. of various lawns,  he was at the point where he was making up to $3,000 to $4,000 and more a summer, and was able to pay me and one other person for helping him. I made upwards of $1,000 over the course of the summer. Of course, that's after 5 years of experience and marketing himself, so I wouldn't expect to make that much up front, ($3,000 or $4000) but you could certainly get there. So, just an idea. It helps to have friends that are willing to help you, but nothing beats the good old ipod and a lawn mower!|`|k2zghjkbaa	LOL not to sound cliche or anything but you could set up a lemonade stand, or mowing peoples grass, or you could just get a job at a restaurant or gas station or something of the sort.

Hope it helped!|`|6ohrp7MEaa	If you live in an area where there are store fronts, you could get the equipment and wash the windows on the fronts every few days.     You might also make money cleaning out people's garages.     If you live in a neighborhood and you or your family are friends with neighbors, you might be able to run errands for them. When I was sick, I used to hire someone to get my groceries and run to the copy store for me and stuff like that.    Another thing is hauling garbage out to the curb for people. It's a chore most people don't like and would pay someone to do. If you charged $5-$10 per house per garbage day, you could easily clear $25-$50 in one morning.    As others have mentioned, people always need trimming and lawn work done. If you have access to a rototiller, you might be able to rent your services with that for people who want a small garden in their backyard.    You're going to need to advertise somehow to make this happen. Normally, flyers and newspaper ads are your most economical options.

afa068247a2da699f9e7513a17e8b3d9aa	Being a nanny is a great job if you love kids and have a lot of patience. The worst part of the job is usually dealing with the parents, who can sometimes be demanding and ask you to do things you didn't really sign up for. There can be very long hours and sometimes you don't get a break for days (if you are a live in nanny) I have been a nanny for the past 3 1/2 years with different families and have had both good and bad experiences. There are some great perks such as a company car, travel, free food or room+board, etc. Another bad part is that when you no longer work for families, it is very hard to leave. You are practically raising the kids and you grow very attached to them. All in all, it is a great job with good money involved -- just know what you're getting yourself into!!|`|3f43024b890acb9ec398f800fe6b3de7aa	Depending on the parents' lifestyle you may just be working five days a week during business hours or could be there 24 hours a day 7 days a week.<br>  If you enjoy working with children and can handle input from the parents, then you will do fine.

cJqrSfBXaa	First off, never take gossip as fact.  You do not know the agenda of this other person who supposedly over heard your boss saying something.  <br>  <br>  How I would handle this is thus:<br>  I would go in and sit down calmly and talk to your boss.  Tell him that you are aware that you do your job to the best of your ability, but feel that you could improve in some areas.  Ask him to evaluate your performance then take his advice.  Do not whine, b***h, relate gossip, brag on yourself,  Show yourself willing to learn.<br>  <br>  If he says that you have too kind of a heart, then accept that and ask him for tips on changing this.  We have that problem with some at the company that I work for.  One of our dispatchers sees only the good in a person and will make excuses for a bad employee until the cows come home or they screw up so badly that it cannot be explained away.  This attitude on this dispatcher's part makes difficulties for the company and costs them money by keeping a bad employee.<br>  <br>  A supervisory position, which is what I assume you are wanting, requires someone who must be able to accurately and unemotionally judge the quality of the employees working under them, be able to lead them to do better, or terminate their employment or at least be able to write them up for HR to terminate.  <br>  <br>  A word of advice, I am a top notch employee, I know it, the companies I work for know it, but I have room for improvement...so do you.  A little humility allows for continuing to learn and advance in one's chosen field.  I would also suggest that you do not discuss your problems with the other employees you work with.  This will only cause gossip and will most definately get back to your boss.  Believe me, he will not appreciate hearing about it from others and that you are creating drama in the workplace...the best thing to do is to go directly to him.<br>  <br>  Good luck lil sister!|`|4dae531c9c6e33259e0ad56888835d2faa	I think you might be at the wrong place at the wrong time....

Some like you to sleep with them some like a littel tease for their oogling eyes, what you need is to get a grip of your career and try and find a happy chappy job where you think you can excel for your goodness.<br>  A little bit of bitchiness is a requirement these days to go up the top but its also called Aristocracy and a Cheeky edge.<br>  <br>  It would have been helpful to know what you actually do as in career wise...but if you do need to confront him, go to his office and tell him you need to talk! and just say it openly,  dont rely on people telling you theor stories....it could be something totally different.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day there are a thousand jobs out there, and if you have exceptional talent, I dont see why you cant go in front of the queue.

They can put you on a 36 month plan and deal with your creditors for you.  You can and should take these steps to make your headaches go away.  You wont be able to use your credit so much for those 3 years or so but again, you will be out from under your debt and can move forward.  My brother in law used the source website and had great success after calling their toll free number.  Good luck.|`|kDXrv8yfaa	get a loan and make sure the interest rate is lower than what you pay now and it better be fixed too.<br>  Pay the credit cards with it.<br>  Now you are paying less interests.
eY0MhGfmaa	First, cut up the credit cards!<br>  <br>  Second, don't touch the 401K.<br>  <br>  Third, negotiate with the credit card companies. Tell them the situation you're in, tell them how much you can pay and when you can pay it. Then DO what you promise.<br>  <br>  They should be willing to work with you if you demonstrate that you are trustworthy and your bad situation is temporary.<br>  <br>  Get out of debt and stay out of debt. Learning to live slightly beneath you means and save your money will ultimately lead to wealth-building.|`|WlhKoxulaa	If all of the other suggestions people are suggesting do not work for you..  Then and only then if you absolutely have to touch your 401k, it  would be better if you take a LOAN from your 401k to pay off some of your credit card debt instead of withdrawing the money.   This is better then a withdrawal for for 2 reasons. 1. If you take out the money as a loan from the 401k,  you will be able to pay back the loan over several years and the money plus interest will go back into your 401k.  2. You will not have to pay taxes on the money you are taking out as a loan, like you would if you just withdrew the money from the account. <br>  <br>   If the 401k loan repayments are too much, just reduce the amount of money you contribute to your 401k plan on a weekly basis to make it balance out.  Try to put some money aside if you can, and when you have enough saved,  pay off your 401k loan balance at one time. Then start up your deductions again to add to the 401k. <br>  <br>  This can work well, because you end up getting rid of some debt, avoid early withdrawal  taxes, and instead of paying interest to the credit card company, you are paying yourself interest. If you reduce weekly contributions to equal what the 401k loan payments are,  you will pay off the loan, but not notice a difference in your paycheck. Check with your HR person to see what payments on a $3000 401k loan will be, and then see how this would work for you.|`|DUNi6RPtaa	If you owe money each month to several different credit cards then it could be a drain on your disposable income. You may find that almost every bit of what you are paying out monthly is only covering the interest as well. One way to take care of this issue is to consider credit card debt consolidation. It can help you to achieve your dream of being debt free in less time. If you want to know more on how to get out of debt check this out <a href="http://www.easy-creditcard.com/credit-card-debt-consolidation/credit-card-debt-consolidation-advice-on-becoming-debt-free/" rel="nofollow">http://www.easy-creditcard.com/credit-ca...</a>|`|Gun3UGzaaa	Don't do it.  At your age, taking money out of your 401k will bring tons of tax penalties - at least 50% of the value of the amount you take out.  In other words, you would have to take out $6k in order to get $3k.  If you are paying on time, try to find a lower rate, especially 0% interest rate card, and transfer the balances. The website fivecentnickel.com has some good advice on this.  Otherwise, get another part time job and pay as you go.|`|dafae2ae3b86a68e315dfbc92b268dc5aa	Early  with-drawls  from  retirement  plans  become  taxable  so  you'd  loose  at  least  15%   plus  the  10%  penalty <br>   for  a  total   loss  of  25% .<br>  I'd   vote  pass  on  that  option .<br>  <br>  Keep  plugging ,  you  will  find  something .<br>  Have  you  considered  restaurant  work  ?<br>  Its  flexible  and  can  be  part  time  . .  .<br>  <br>  Good  Luck<br>  <br>  >|`|b5CuYq17aa	Well, taking money out of your 401(k) is never a good idea unless you are in danger of losing your home.  You pay taxes plus a 10% penalty and then you also lose all the growth on that money.  Think what that $3,000 would be worth in 40 years!!!!!<br>  <br>  Call all of them and work out a payment plan and try to get your interest lowered or stopped.<br>  <br>  Then, make the minimum payments on every one of them. On the lowest dollar value, put all your extra effort toward paying it off. Once it is paid off, then roll that extra money to the next largest balance. Continue this snowball until all your debts are paid off.<br>  <br>  You probably need to cut your expenses back to the bare minimum. Get rid of cable, cell phones, internet, etc. Lower your electric bill, gas bill, water bill, etc. Don't eat at a restaurant until your debts are under control. Take a sandwich for lunch. Cancel the gym membership.<br>  <br>  Try to increase your income by getting another second job. If you have a car with payments, get rid of it, and buy a good dependable used car for CASH.<br>  <br>  Go to the library and get "The Total Money Makeover". Read it and follow it carefully.<br>  <br>  Go check out Dave's website as well:<br>  www.DaveRamsey.com|`|i9NAcRwBaa	As several other answers pointed out, you're going to have to pay taxes on the money you withdraw from your 401k, so you're not actually going to get the full amount you withdraw to pay off your debt anyway.<br>  <br>  Something else to consider is the effect of the market turmoil over the last several weeks. If your 401k is invested in the stock market, you've probably lost a fair bit of value.<br>  <br>  If you withdraw money from it now, you're essentially "locking in" those losses because your investment won't have the chance to increase in value again.<br>  <br>  You're young enough that you are almost guaranteed that your investment will increase in value back to where it was or better. Even if it takes 10-15 years for this to happen, any losses that you've experienced right now will be corrected.<br>  <br>  If you really want to increase your debt payments and get it paid off asap, you'd be better off to stop any further contributions to your 401k and use that money to pay down your credit cards.<br>  <br>  Just be aware that by stopping your contributions, you may also lose any matching contributions from your employer.<br>  <br>  What you need to determine is which is the best investment for you - your 401k or your debt? If you're paying 15% interest on your credit cards, for example, putting the money against that essentially earns you a 15% guaranteed return. Can you make that if you contribute the money to your 401k?
iDlC7M4paa	One thing not spoken of in the TV is that credit cards are unsecured debt, and if you don't pay the cards, they can't take anything or do anything about it! <br>  If you were to stop paying, they will try to take you to court, but really they can't do a thing. They will just waste lawyer money and court time to scare you into a settlement.<br>  I know this because my father had to accrue alot of credit card debt after his 2nd heart attack. He owns a small landscaping business. The 2nd attack occured during the summer, which is a busy time of the year.<br>  The year following the 2nd heart attack, he had a 3rd one, during which he opted for a all-out bypass. This happened in the spring, when leaving winter. You don't make money in the winter landscaping.<br>  Being out of work for a month or two, he called all companies far in advance to let them know and to make a better payment schedule.<br>  All worked with him except for Citi. He had $20,000 owed to them.<br>  They were rude so he said "F&*^ you."<br>  He stopped sending payments. They called often. Several months later he had a notice for court.<br>  He got a lawyer, which cost him $500. Since credit card debt is unsecured, there is no law saying we must pay this money back!<br>  The $20,000 was written off. Citi just take you to court to scare you.<br>  Just a big waste of the judge's time and everyone. Court was minutes long.<br>  <br>  One note however, is that the $20,000 write off is considered income on your taxes... So you will get a 1099 with $20,000 of income.<br>  <br>  If you can't pay credit cards, don't.<br>  <br>  Be cautious about credit  help agencies as they are there for the benefit of Citi, not you.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	you say you are having serious trouble making your payments, but if you are still making them anyway then your credit rating is still good...if you can keep from messing that up then all the better.  Debt consolidation takes a tole on your credit rating too and in many cases even more of a toll.  Keep trying to get a second job or just a new job that pays you more money and keep those debts paid.  If you are unable to keep your debts in good standing and your credit goes south...then go bankrupt...it won't be so bad and it goes by quickly and after the discharge aprox one year...you can get a secured master card from Capitol One and start rebuilding your c redit.<br>  |`|AA10423600	The previous answer is doing an awful lot of wishful thinking if he thinks credit card companies can not come after you.<br>  <br>  That may be true in a couple of states (Texas has no wage garnishment laws for example)....but most states they WILL sue you and they WILL garnish your wages or take your bank accounts.  In Michigan they can take seize property and take your state income tax returns.  So take such advice with care.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I would need a lot more info.  But here is what I usually tell people.<br>  <br>  Start by sitting down and making a very serious budget.  No more dining out, entertainment or wasteful spending.  No Cable TV or cell phones, learn to car pool, and learn how to shop with coupons.<br>  <br>  Then, after figuring out your budget see how much "disposable income" you have left to pay your debts.  <br>  <br>  Now, contact all of your creditors and see what sort of deal they will offer you to settle.  Will they reduce your principle (not likely).  Lower your interest rates and freeze the late penalties (maybe).  <br>  <br>  After doing all of this, do you have enough "disposable income" to make the bills?  If so, follow that plan.  <br>  <br>  To pay off a $20k debt over 3 years, you will need about $500 a month.  Can you afford that?<br>  <br>  If not, then you may need to consider bankruptcy.  But note that unless you qualify for a chapter 7, you will be doing exactly what I just outlined.  The court will force you onto a budget and take whatever disposable income you have.  You will be living very tight for 3 years.<br>  <br>  But in exchange, your creditors will be forced to stop harassing you, stop charging interest and late fees, and accept a lesser amount on the debt.  <br>  <br>  It will be on your credit report for 10 years, but generally your credit will improve within a year or two after the discharge.  If you plan correctly, you will be in decent shape after 3 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|37qSY5smaa	My advice would be to avoid filing bankruptcy completely.  Here is why,  NEW LAWS  have made it a lot tougher to file for personal bankruptcy and now you have to pay a lot of the money back.  Your bills aren't just wiped out after 7 yrs.  Depending on what you own, the bankruptcy court will send out someone to inventory your house and they will confiscate your valuable belongings. Don't think you can sell off your big money items (like electronics etc.) and then declare bankruptcy because they will check any purchases you have made in the past year.  That could even keep you from being eligible for bankruptcy because they would consider it fraud.  I am not kidding, I know someone heading toward bankruptcy and it's not as easy as it once was to just wipe out your debts.  My advice would be to go to a credit/personal finance counselor and have them help you set up a payment plan.  Sometimes credit card companies will set up a minimum payment plan if they know you are willing to cooperate with them.  The more bills you run up with credit card companies, the more interest they charge you, so you are throwing a lot of money away just by letting the amount get really high.  By working with a credit counselor to manage your payments, the credit card companies will probably be willing to lower the interest rate you are paying.  PLEASE get professional advice before you decide to try to file for bankruptcy.  Good luck!
Pjm9pg7iaa	Wall Street Journal had a big article about the problems with the "debt consolidation" industry. A high percentage of scammers who take your money and do not pay.  It is so bad that American Express will no longer deal with 3rd party debt companies. They will only deal with you directly.<br>  <br>  Bankruptcy clears things up quickly. It used to hurt you for 7 years. It is still bad but you will get credit card offers 2 weeks after the bankruptcy is discharged.<br>  <br>  Or you call everyone you owe money and promise not to forget about them but you just have no money now. And send them $2 a week for as long as it takes..|`|MYjY3LDbaa	A debt consolidation is better than bankruptcy.  <br>  <br>  First, stop using the credit cards. Then keep making minimum payments on all except the card with the smallest balance.  Put all extra money toward paying that card off. Keep that going until all cards are paid off.<br>  <br>  If you choose a consolidation approach, you have to pay off the debt with the same urgency as the procedure stated above.  If you don't the interest will eat you alive.  Understand that a consolidation doesn't reduce your debt, only spread it over a longer pay timeline, thus it ends up costing you more over the length of repayment.<br>  <br>  Bankruptcy will ruin you for years to come.  And yes, your employer can pull your credit report.<br>  <br>  As far as a second job, take anything that will bring in money while you look for better options.<br>  <br>  You can do it.  Get it done.

The maximum a wife can claim from her existing or even a divorced husband is the monthly maintenance if she has no means to maintain herself to prevent her destitute condition or place to reside if she doesn't have a place to reside till the time she gets remarried or acquires a place to reside in this case too there is no hard & fast rule that the place of residence has to be the place belonging to the husband it can be any place which the husband according to his capability he can provide on rent or otherwise for her residence.

So no use transferring the titles of your flat in your father's name which won't serve any purpose rather add on your problem as after the death of your father all his other legal heir other then you will be claiming a share in that property, now even after getting rid of your wife by decree of divorce & final settlement of all the property/financial matter with her, new claimants will be sitting on your head just for nothing, then again you will seek legal relief from them.|`|WYjbuu6saa	You better seek the advice of a real estate attorney!!!<br>  <br>  |`|6420863db80e72b5bcabe473e6c08b36aa	Get the 'Gift Deed' prepared and get the same Registered.<br>  <br>  This is simple.

Rob can claim that he was told this verbally by Felicia, but since Rob did not pay for the use of the rooftop, and Felicia had originally agreed to it as a favor, Rob has no legal standing.

However, he should have had to file last year (one time only) in order to receive his $300 stimulus rebate check.  If he did not file this income last year and did not get a stimulus check, he can still file this year to receive the stimulus for 2008.  Check with your local tax office for free assistance and filing help to help file his return.

lo0SpHzNaa	http://www.freewebs.com/whowantsmoney/   Do it|`|OOkNg0IIaa	There are a good bunch of paying survey sites out there...and yes paid surveys are real, but the problem is that there are far more sites "posing" as surveys out there than there are real ones. I first started doing surveys about 5 years ago. I signed up with over 300 sites (today I am with well over 600 sites) and now, I regularly get paid by about 50 of them.    My first month I made a whopping $5. The next few months were more of the same. But I stuck with it and was patient. Today, again 5 years later, I regularly make at least $600 on paid surveys.    Here are the key things to remember.    1. There are no guarantees with surveys. It's all about your demographics. Sometimes they will want teens, other times they will want working moms, other time they will want physicians.    2. You really need to be with the biggest group of legit sites you can find. The more sites you are with, the more likely that you will actually match up your demographics with surveys and get paid.    3. Don't ever pay for a list. Period. All of the same information is out there for free.    4. Be patient. If it works for you, it won't work instantly. I can't tell you how many people have contacted me saying "I am giving up after a month." Well, like I said, if I did that I would have stopped making $5.    But the upside to surveys is that there is no risk. You don't spend any money and if you try it and like it, great. And if you don't you walk away. If you want to check out my blog where I track the survey sites that have actually paid me, feel free to visit http://www.thesurveystar.blogspot.com    Good luck!|`|CVdpAnRAaa	Ciao is very good, i have often received payments from them.

EDIT TO YOUR COMMENT:    You can't get the same amount as your friend because you don't have the income.  You would never qualify for that amount because you would never be able to make the payments.    EDIT TO YOUR LAST COMMENT:      That may be...but does that amount include your taxes, homeowners insurance or PMI?  What about your utilities?

AA11206283	If he is in title and you are not, his property MAY have to pass thru probate before it can pass to you in some states. If you are in title as Husband and wife, tenants by the entirety with right of survivorship, the deed will pass to you without probate; the mortgage would still be your problem.    Any real estate lawyer can do a deed of gift adding you to the deed for probably less than 100 bucks and whatever the recording fees are.|`|yHl7RIuOaa	Use "Quit Claim" deed whereby your husband will grant his sole interest in property to you and him . So John Doe will grant his interest to John Doe and Jane Doe.      Your county will will charge you a nominal fee to record this. Your county may have a form to use or otherwise contact a title company or attorney to do this.    Note you will never be on the mortgage loan.

SIhxrxD3aa	Dental hygienist doesn't necessarily make more than a veterinarian.  Veterinarians start out making about $60,000/year and that's about average overall for hygeinists.  So, I think that 10 years into either field a veterinarian would be making more.  However, it is more expensive to go to vet school than dental hygiene school and you would graduate with a lot of debt.  You shouldn't base your decision solely on money.  Veterinarians make enough to be comfortable even with those loans.    But, being a vet is more than just liking animals.  You have to like medicine and science as well and do well in science courses.  It's difficult to be a vet and many people who go into it based solely on a love of animals and don't enjoy any of the other aspects end up getting burned out.    Loving animals too much can often get in the way if you're a vet because you have to euthanize animals, sometimes for silly reasons and you have to deal with owners that aren't treating their animals the way you think they should be.    The best way to decide if veterinary medicine is for you is to spend some time working in a vet clinic.  This is required anyway if you decide to go on to vet school.  Even if it's only in a voluntary, or observational role you will get to see exactly what a veterinarian has to do all day long|`|6HgiNCmqaa	its always best to have a career u like. if u get lots of money for u job but complety hate it, than thATS when u will regret|`|Lp1NyTfyaa	Try to work or volunteer at a vet hospital to get a feel for the work.  I used to want to be a veterinarian because I love animals too, but it is a lot of school.  First you need a bachelors, which takes four years, and then you need your DVM, which is another four years.  And, the undergraduate curriculum is heavy in the math and sciences (calculus, physics, chemistry, biology).  I wasn't good at this coursework, so now I plan to do either law or guide dog mobility training.  But, if you're a math/science person and you're willing to do the schooling, I say go for it!|`|DZB0WCmmaa	I'Ve got a vet friend-over her 40ies and her job is her life and her passion.

AA10464818	It is indeed the essence of DROP SHIPPING --- IF AND ONLY IF the first seller is aware that they are doing this for you    Chances are the seller will not agree to do it; afterall, the item sold way more than when they sold it    Plus, they can't send it to anyone other than YOU because they need to protect themselves in case you complain. They will have no leg to stand on if they sent it to your buyer, and not to you if you complain (e.g. your buyer did not receive the item or did not like the item).     If they ship the item, the seller will want to have a tracking information to show the item reached YOU -- their buyer (and not your buyer)    If you're going to do this, do this on YOUR OWN and do not involve the other seller.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I wouldn't.

There is nothing your friend can do, except get an operators policy.  At least that way he's protected.

Hope she can afford it if he does call. And if he does, I hope she never lets him drive her car again, since he could cause her to get sued for everything she owns, or ever plans on owning for the rest of her life if he gets in an accident.

Or if you have not made any arrangements for good faith payments.   I don't think you got the question out right - You are making child support payments.  You are not on child support - your child receives child support.    Why not call the "probation" department (that is what child support enforcement is referred to) and make sure that your pay is automatically deducted and how much so you can keep track if not detailed in your pay-stub, etc. Something like this should always be confirmed as those agencies are known to make mistakes.

Or was it you Big Woolf?|`|yO5tm6e1aa	TurboTax has a 1040X feature.  It'll guide you through the whole process.    I suggest you wait until at least mid February before filing any taxes (or amendments).  Investment income often comes late.  And, sometimes companies send corrections too.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Good luck.  Your first mistake was in using TT in the first place.|`|AA11414777	You can file the amended return through Turbo Tax but you should wait until the refunds come before filing the amended return.  To file sooner could slow up the refund.  Just make sure the amended return is filed before April 15th and if there is any monies owed, send it along with the amended return.  Chances are that the IRS would catch the stray W-2 at a later date and that could cause your step-dad to owe interest and penalties if not paid before the April 15th.
fFnsJ7maaa	I would imagine that any publicly traded company would be a bit more diversified. I googled "Asphalt Market", and found a link to a report about the market.
