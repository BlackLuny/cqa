20090220220409AAQwpXR	Social Science;Psychology	I have trouble communicating because my mid seems not able to get thoughts into words?	When I try to talk to most people what I want to say and what comes out are different. Like the second or third word of what I want to say comes out as opposed to the first word and then I get so annoyed I just stop talking and feel like smashing something (please don't focus on this.) Anyway, I'm not dyslexic. I can read perfectly fine it's just I have trouble communicating. I feel like my thoughts come to fast to select what to say first or something. When I get certain thoughts I have to make sure I write them down quickly so I don't forget them because things are always going through my mind. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

20090220220949AAAOUVB	Social Science;Psychology	How to cure social anxiety disorder?	I'm going to make this fast. I'm a very quiet person. I don't like to socialize too much. I don't like making friends very much and much prefer to stick by myself and do things independently and alone. So I prefer it that way. BUT, I am also shy. A lot of introverted people have no problem speaking up in public when necessary, they just prefer not too. The problem is I have shyness AND am introverted.       Anyway I have problems engaging in simple social situations. For example I dread going into the office at school and see it as a tremendous burden. I have trouble looking people in the eyes and also when I have to hand small items to other people I'm afraid they ill see my hand shaking. I know this is really pathetic, but I would just like to be able to communicate with people when necessary. I don't want to be sociable, I just want to know how to be able to be confident when these skills are necessary (e.g. going into the office at school.) Thanks.

20090220163703AA8qXFt	Social Science;Economics	Couple of economics questions (macroeconomics)?	1) A new financial innovation results in people switching their funds from checking deposits to savings accounts. The quantity of M1 ________ and the quantity of M2 ________.    a) decreases; increases    b) decreases; decreases    c) decreases; does not change    d) increases; decreases      I think the answer would be a here since savings accounts are not part of M1.      2) Which of the following best describes the chain of events in the money creation process?    a) Low interest rates discourage people from holding currency. When they deposit the currency, interest rates rise, increasing the quantity of money.    b) Desired reserves increase, encouraging banks to seek new deposits. When the new depositors come in, desired reserves decrease and the quantity of money increases.    c) Currency is drained from the quantity of money into the banking system, where it is lent out. The loans are spent, increasing the currency drain and also the quantity of money.    d) The monetary base increases. Banks acquire excess reserves which they loan out, increasing deposits and also the quantity of money. The new deposits then create additional excess reserves.      After looking at the money creation process, d sounds like the right answer here.      -Thanks for any help on either one.

20090220180044AAkdOrQ	Social Science;Psychology	Do you find it hard sometimes to be emotionally "appropriate"?	I work at a food shelf and I was calling people to remind them of an upcoming distribution. One lady started telling me all her woes and I was tired and cranky for lack of sleep the night before. All I said was "sorry" without any emotion and I know she was taken aback by it.      What do you think? Are you responsible for coming up with the "right" emotion in a circumstance regardless of your frame of mind?      Personally, I felt kind of angry that I was expected to respond at all. If I was talking to her now I would have a kinder response.       Was I wrong?

20090220180102AAYGwqX	Social Science;Psychology	What is this, a past life or a product of my over-active imagination?	For as long as I can remember I've been seeing in my mind's eye a very lean, thin boy dying of the bubonic plague in Europe. His family abandoned him and he was left to die all alone. His body is ringed with big dark black spots everywhere and he can barely move. He is in the bedroom of his house upstairs where I see red light from sunset shining through. So what is this do you think? I've always had a strange fascination with the middle ages and have had other similar things in my mind's eye. I can see this as if I was there watching the whole thing. I wonder though if as a child I heard a story about something similar and had such a powerful imagination (that I basically don't have anymore) that stories told to me would form "memories" in my mind that seemed as real as reality. So what do you think this is about? Any ideas are greatly appreciated...
20090220175116AAmUu8o	Social Science;Psychology	What characterizes an attitude of self-sacrifice in high-risk jobs?	OK, this is a bit long. First, it's not for homework. I have been considering doing a small documentary project. It's also a complex question about human nature. If you can't be bothered with reading the details, please move on.      It starts with a silly thing.      In the movie Bad Boys, there are two black cops and two hispanic cops and they have playful friction - UNTIL things hit the fan.      The clincher at the end comes when one black cop says 'this ___ is real. This could get you killed.'      And the hispanic cops become serious and drop the competitiveness to (and this is the point) put their lives at major risk. This arc is repeated in the second movie.      Now Hollywood is Hollywood and everything is exaggerated, BUT, I know this does happen in real life. And that is what I am asking about.      There are two concepts here: altruism and an exaggerated response to an overwhelming challenge.      I want to apply the 'magnifying glass' to real life jobs involving major risk:   police, military, firefighters and in some cases doctors and others.      The Question:   How does an individual reason out to themselves that it is important or 'worth it' to do something that may or in some extreme cases _WILL_ get them killed?      The obvious answer is that they could be playing to a greater good: protection of land, protection of a system of ideals, responding to commands from a perceived higher authority...      But I want to examine specifically when this is not the case. I want to know about when the 'good' that could result from such an action is small. For example: protection of an unknown person, ESPECIALLY where the person is not in a life/death risk situation, action where the result will likely be unknown or insignificant, action where the risk could easily be taken by someone else to whom the result is more pertinent...      Personal experiences are welcome.   Educated or well-thought out responses are also welcome.

20090220180627AAHUg7Z	Social Science;Psychology	Any advice on how I may strike the mood or get something going?	There was and is things striking in the way. Me and my husband have been married for a week but from us having a small budget it was through the Justice Of The Peace and no honeymoon. At first bad news struck about a relative being in the hospital which made us worry. We know now she is out and ok. Also during this time, a friend was spending the night for a few days and brought his PS1, PS2, and PS3 leading my husband and another close friend who is currently under a small budget and half way lives with us (he has an apartment he can only afford rent on) to play the games nonstop and not sleep much. Unlike most men, my husband isn't always in the mood 24/7, though he is who usually starts it, and we have with the friend who half way lives with us here. He is now catching up on sleep, but when he gets back in gear I don't know how I can strike the mood from our friend leaving his PS1 here, our other friend being around so often, and I also being 38 weeks pregnant. What can I do? I know right after birth you can't make love and I wanna schedule an appointment with my gynecologist asap after about maybe going on birth control since I wasn't on it before and we used condoms. Any ideas how I might be able to get something going with my husband? Even before we were married it had been a little while.

The guy is in his 40s, single and kinda gives me the creeps (although he's never made any advancements towards me),  My friend says he has caught this guy staring at preeteen and teenage boys (undressing with his eyes), and once told my friend that he "likes them young and naive".  I don't see him as a personal threat to me, but I worry about my friend who is 15 and looks younger than he is.  But I haven't actually heard anything my friend claims this guy said, nor have I seen him do anything wrong....he just generally creeps me out even though I have no solid evidence.  What should I do?

Do you think if a company are deferring shares from 1p to 0.01p and increasing the numbr of shares on the open market by 10 times is healthy. It mean i have ten times the number of shares so 4.5 million but the new price of them is 0.01 so the value stays the same 4.5k. However the number of shares on the open market is not 1.5 billion instead of 150 million. Suppy and demand suggests it won't go up as there are floods of shares on the market. Do you just think if a company is going the route of deferred shares it is about to go bankrupt to liquidation.

In my dream it was black and white and I noticed a hole on the inner side of my right elbow. It was a hole the size of a quarter and I could see into it. When I went for a closer look it was dry and hollow and I could smell dead flesh. I didn't see any muscles or bones, just a few dried veins. I then took a look at my left arm and saw the same thing, but it was a much bigger hole. What really freaks me out is that I smell the dead flesh. I'm perfectly healthy and I've been having the same dream for around 4 days now.      If anyone can help, thanks.

I am embarrassed to talk to my friends and family about it because I feel like some pretentious teenage whiner. I've had a death in the family and some falling out with friends, but that happened a while ago and I feel like I should have gotten better by now.      Every time I think about being depressed I get angry with myself because I know my life is better than so many people in the world, but I can't help it. I've thought about killing myself, but then I realize I just think about it because I crave attention and it makes me more angry with myself. It's like a vicious circle as I get more angry and depressed.      I am embarrassed to talk to anyone about it so I act like nothing is wrong. I know that people who answer are just going to say I need to talk to someone close or something, but I feel guilty about doing that because my life isn't "bad" or anything, and it's not like my family is struggling, so I think they'll just think of me as some whiner who wants attention.      Is there anyone who has gone through the same thing who can give me some advice on anything else that you can do to get through it?

20090220191938AAzh3UQ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Women, do you think we will rule the world?	Women have caught up with men in many fields, often overtaking them already. Given equal chances now, women are scoring much better in all fields of education, leaving their male fellows far behind.   We will see a new generation of Alpha women who, at an average, will outearn their men and be in charge in the relationship, being the main breadwinner, with their men, in many cases (if not as a mainstream phenomenon) staying at home, doing the housework and raising the children, taking their wifeâ€²s last name in the marriage and lovingly relying on her guidance and leadership, supporting her career.   If the trend will continue, showing that women are better equipped with the necessary skills for our future society, it will be natural if they take over to lead us. It is time to turn the tables. I would like to give it a try.

20090220193739AAJIjcL	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What do you do when you don't like any of the women who like you nor what turns them on about you?	I hate how I look. I'm 6'3", broad shouldered, and started losing my hair at 17, so I'm forced to shave it now, so I look like some meathead soldier or cop or something.      I've never attracted a single girl I liked, and I gave most of them a chance just to make sure I wasn't making snap judgments. Just as I predicted, they were needy, desperate, and looking for a father figure. Creepily enough, all of them wanted to be dominated sexually: if I held them down by their wrists and overpowered them, they were in ecstasy and I hated myself even more.      I can lose weight, but I can't get my hair back nor can I change my general stature. I hate it, but I can't do anything about it. I don't know how to get over it.      Oh, and please don't tell me to "learn to love yourself the way you are" or assure me that "some girl will come along who loves you for your inner beauty". I'm immune to pop psychology platitudes.

20090220190917AAa9Ab2	Social Science;Psychology	Guidance counselor is brutal towards me when I needed help?	Okay, I don't know what to do. There's a teacher who's harassing me, Short version of story :      Teacher made us (every student) grade each others papers and I graded a guy's paper who was almost completely flawless and she called me a liar and lazy for not "properly" grading it. I didn't do anything wrong anyway. I did as what she said and she said I was lazy for that..... I find it really offensive and inappropriate for a teacher to call a student 'lazy' and a 'liar' and she's the one who's lazy. She's the teacher, she should be grading the papers, not us. She also said I was using a "blue" pen when I was using a "BLACK" pen and she rolls her eyes at me when I told her that.      So anyways, today, I went to the counselor for some help and my counselor started to be completely brutal to me and say things like I change the story.... I don't know where she got that from. First, I told her the story and she kept interrupting me so obviously, she WOULD have problems understanding it when she didn't even let me finish. Then, she wants ME to TALK to the TEACHER.... Why on earth would I talk to a teacher who calls me a liar and lazy when that teacher herself falsely accuses me of things and refuses to listen when I defend myself. This counselor isn't even a counselor to start with. She was a kindergarten teacher for 9 years and this school hires her....      Anyways, please help. Idk what to do now. It seems like this no-brained counselor doesn't want to help and only want to criticize me and support the teacher because she USED to be a teacher..... Also, don't mention my parents because they abuse me and this is why I'm really sensitive not only to myself but to everyone around me.      I'm getting once-a-week counseling because of things with my parents and such so you don't have to worry and thanks for your concern.

Theres nothing wrong with me, and theres no reason I shouldn't, but maybe I would if my bad thoughts about myself didn't exist?

20090203102622AAiRmoU	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	If a woman's prerogative is to change her mind (be flakey) how can you blame men for being insensitive?	I used to model and I knew plenty of girls who modelled, and let me tell you these girls are anything but sensitive to men.  They would tell me amusing stories (to them) of guys wanting to commit suicide when they dumped him, how when they were in their mid-teens guys would cry and that would just make them laugh.  I even heard above-average looking girls having a big laugh about that.  I have gay male friends who told me what a lot of younger women really think of men.  Fast forward a few years.  Do girls/women ever think that their capriciousness might have something to do with men's attachment issues?  Men develop a thicker skin.  Maybe some guys think, "we'll this girl will break my heart, so at least I can have her bust my nut."  Did you ever think that when you dismissed guys right and left, ones who were perfect gentlemen to you, but didn't drive the right car or live in the right neighbourhood, or knew the right people, when you were younger that that behaviour repeated by you and your peers may have something to do with the fact that guys are such '@zzholes' and don't want to commit?

So, my mom does daycare and one of the kids said something about him and his friend in reference to color. I don't remember exactly how it started, but at one point I started asking him about everyone and he very nonchalantly, as if I was pointing to letters and asking him to identify them, assigned a color to each person. I'd be like "what color am i?" and he'd say "red" then "what color is my sister?" "um... purple" etc. I have two friends with very different forms of synesthesia and i've looked up a few things about it but i haven't seen anything about people being colors. I can't really ask him for details because he's only 2, but there could be something more to it.

20090219111932AAyjrYh	Social Science;Psychology	Girls only. If you found a guy and he was 3 inches tall, what would you do?	Would you have him paint your toes?   Would you step on him?   Kidnap him?   Would you enslave him?   Have him kiss your feet?   Have him rub your feet?   Sit on him?   Tattoo him and (where)?   Make him smell something bad?   Stuff him in your dirty sock?   Have him do Other stuff? (anything you can think of.) funny is good too.      But if you have a better answer then go for it. I'm writing a story and need some ideas and basic plots.   I am actually thinking of having 3 different girls come into the story at different time. One is a good friend, one really mean and cruel and one who falls in love with him.   Thanks for your help.

20090219124406AAv8ZGC	Social Science;Psychology	Women, do you get jealous easily?	I am addressing this question to women age 30 and up only. I am curious if any other women this age, besides myself, have problems with jealousy that seem to come out of the blue when you encounter younger women who are very pretty or attractive? I don't want to hear any lies like "no, never" from those of you who do experience this. I want to hear honest answers. I think I have a major problem with jealousy because every time I see a girl who is young and very attractive, I get so envious that I almost become sick to my stomach and have this never-ending, stupid fear that she is somehow going to go after my man, even if he isn't even with me at the time. I have spoken to my psychologist about this and she has said this appears to be a common problem with women my age. I want to learn how I can deal with these issues.

But have you ever resumed a friendship after breaking off ALL contact with ex? and if yes when did this happen? (a few weeks or longer time after the breakup?) I'm assuming that both partners would be willing to be friends.      how did you re-establish contact?

20090219124746AA1kRmX	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I feel like I need to die, even if I don't have a reason for it?	-I'm NOT tired of my life.   -I do not have a screwed up life.   -I do not want public attention.      YET I feel like I should die as fast as possible. I seriously do not know why, but all of a sudden I get these thoughts, and I say to myself "I wish I get leukemia, or any kind of cancer, or die all of a sudden.   Weird, I know.      But that's probably because of my mom and my medical history.      -I was born with a bad sinus (most of the people in my family background have sinus problems, but I got the worst). I will require 2 surgeries in the future.   -I had my appendix removed when I was 12....ok, that's common.   -I was diagnosed with the presence of stones in my gall bladder while I was having my appendix checked.   -I had Pneumothorax when I was 14.   -I also had my Gall-Bladder removed when I was 14.   -I recently got glasses, cause once again, the faulty gene has blurred my eyesight (yes it's genetic...my optician said so, and I was the only one left in my family of 4)   -Now just today, I had a bad headache, at the back of my skull.      I told my mom about this headache, and she replies "I don't know what to do with you. You are a bag of diseases. I don't know how long I can take care of you like this. I'm really tired and I think I'll die taking care of you. You have to stop. The next thing we'll find you you got tumor in your head!"      That's what hurt me bad...now I feel like I'm a burden to my parents, and if I just die, they're gonna be free.      I got really upset and blurted out "Then good! At least you'll get rid of me if I die!"   She replies "What is there to get rid of? My life won't end if you die."      She had a point, but it was the way she said it.      Now I'm just wishing I get some BAD disease that should kill me right away, and finish off their problems all at once.      So, what do you guys suggest I should do, cause talking to her will make things worse...she doesn't like it when I tell her that she hurts me...she gets mad and blames me for it.      Also, is it totally abnormal for me to feel this way, cause according to my mom, I have no emotions and I'm a stone cold person who'll absorb everything she says.      Also, what would you call this feeling?   (I'm 16)

20090219111455AA4jgdz	Social Science;Psychology	Overcoming a miscarriage..?	I had a miscarriage 3 weeks ago. It was my first pregnancy. It has been difficult for my husband and me. I have seen him very sad lately and I donâ€™t know how to help him.   His family and relatives know about what happened, but I feel that he didnâ€™t get enough  support from them. His parents left for a trip the day after we found out about the miscarriage. His mom and dad called a few times. His sister called only once. Nobody else called.     I am still super sad, but I talk on the phone with my family and relatives and e-mail my friends almos everyday, all of them live in another country.     I donâ€™t know how to help him, I know men are different, but I still believe he needed more support from his family.  Probably I am wrong.   What should I do to make him feel better? What activities should we do as a couple to overcome this sad moment?  I canâ€™t think right now and I need help.

It makes her not like her self and trying to figure out why people don't like her or look at her a certain way.

20090219115050AAWxdYE	Social Science;Psychology	Do I have a Normal/Gifted/Genius child ?	My daughter is 25 months.    She knows the sequence of tasks. She tries to tell me her short term ( 1-2 hour) schedule at times. That.. first she wants to do coloring , read books and then breakfast, water.. It includes things which I have not done with her before.       She is not a TV person but showed interest in potty training videos. With very little effort from our side (some books) she got trained at around 20 months.       She has been a very stable walker since long. She could jump with both feet when she was not even 18. She started walking around 10 months. I could make her walk with support when she was six mnths. She is an extremely alert and careful person. She knew the cause and effect things in 18 months like if I place the cup on the edge of a table , she will ask me to shift it â€¦ it will fell down.        She has a very long attention span. If something is of her interest she sits for long time. She loves stories. She makes stories and tries to tell. She tries to do funny stories even. She tries to make us laugh.   .       She could read few words like pig, fat, big when she was about 20 months. She knows all letter sounds. She reads simple words on her own. If you ask her to point a word in the book she will point to the right word most of the time. We do not speak English at home. She has not been out to any Daycare/Pre-School environment yet. We always had a Hindi Speaking family member or nanny with her but she picked up things from very little opportunities she has received so far. I do have one First grader at home. I speak Hindi(other language) almost all time. When I first started reading books to her regularly she was the one taking initiative to show me the things all around her. If I read ball, she would bring the ball. If I read clock, she will point to real clock etc at very young age (Now I donâ€™t remember that).  Now I donâ€™t read her those kinds of books.          She could tell about her physical health when she was very young. Like tummy ache, ear acheâ€¦ The symptoms appeared to me 1 day late when she had fever or hard stool next day. She at times asked me to put medicine in her ear when there was little wax.          She remembers olds events very well.          She sometimes walks stairs one leg at a time. First time she did was about 20 months only. She was running away from a stranger at my home and went upstairs as quick as she could. She speaks Hindi and English both languages very well.          She is very much sympathetic to situations. If I am sad, mad, irritated she knows that.       She knows how to take turns, share things very well.       She holds crayons and pencils really good. Even if she can not but tells that she is drawing a picture of dinosor, Ananya(her name), Wolf etc. She can make horizontal, vertical lines, circles , some alphabets.      She does not give problems at bed time. She has been knowing the difference of day and night since long.       She can count till 10 very easily. Things like how many buttons I have on my sweater.       The biggest reason I started documenting this is.. She has been really very cooperative child. She is not fussy about anything I would say. She agrees to new things as easily as she follows her old schedule.       She has completely changed my mindset. With my elder one, I was a parent who always thought that trying to teach something before 4 year will turn off childrenâ€™s interest. Or it will be too much pressure etc. They are too young to do any work. Their hands are soft. I had so many reasons that I did not really work with my elder one till she turned 4. I used to read books to her and that was all.          With my second one, I feel like I am now a different person. I often find myself telling my friends about the power of showing the flashcards, giving them crayon, tracing books etc. If I donâ€™t do these things my younger one specifically asks for things. I think she is gifted. Am I being biased?
20090219115424AA5kQJK	Social Science;Psychology	Just tired of interacting with the human race, any advice?	Hi,     More and more, the older I get, the harder it gets for me to talk to people and deal with them. I find most of them tiring and I am not treated well by them. I see myself as a good person who tries to be fair and decent, but I guess that's not how the world in general sees me, because people as a rule don't like me and don't pay any attention to me and in general treat me like I am invisible. I have never really been able to understand why and I am pretty much overwhelmed with the world.  I kind of need to interact somewhat to earn money so I wish I could make it easier, and of course it would be nice to have friends etc. although I don't see that ever happening.   I don't know if anyone can offer any advice.

We live in Iowa and the recession hasn't been bad here, but you can tell the recession is creeping up on us. My parents are making more than the average american, but we've been saving all our money. Everyone on the news keeps saying how bad the economy is and freaking me out A LOT lately. And Obama's new stimulus plan kinda scared me even more because were spending even more money when we owe so much to other countries. Overall, I just want to know if the economy is going to get better and how long will it take? But if its going straight downhill forever, what can we do to keep our heads above water.

Another time I had a dream of my grandma (she appeared in my dream and sat down. that was it) Three days later she passed on.    I have many examples. None of these dreams are good. Wish they were but no.    Now are they premonitions? Or coincidences??
