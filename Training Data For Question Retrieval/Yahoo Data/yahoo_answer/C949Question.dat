20090128152732AAlENpG	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Young couple with pretty good income, but low down payment, can I buy a home?	I've gotten through advanced calc and computational analysis courses, but navigating the world of finance and mortgages is still a bit daunting..  any help would be appreciated:      I make $75-80k and my spouse makes about 40.  We've been renting in the MD-DC-VA suburbs for 4+ years, with perfect rental history (paying about 1300/mo), and have average credit.      We'd be first-time buyers.  I know we could easily swing the monthly payments, it's just the initial costs I'm not sure about.      Anyway, given this income (total about 110k/year before taxes), and a small (say 3-5k) down payment.  What options, if any, are there for buying a 250k-300k (town)home? (we're 25 years old if that matters)   I'm aware of FHA loans, but how/if they would help lower the inital costs is still a mystery.      Thanks!

20090128153452AAHQrNJ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can our landlord make us get rid of our dog on our lease?	Our landlord was informed that we could not have our dog by his insurance company. He is a Pit Bull Terrier. Apparently they saw him through our fence doing a yearly inspection. I did not see anyone, or possibly I was not home. Because of this, he is telling us that we have to either get rid of our dog, pay $600 for him to switch insurance companies, or be evicted. This dog IS on our lease, and we have lived in this house for over a year and a half. This dog is a part of our family, we have had him for almost 6 years. We don't have $600 to give to him, nor do we feel that we should have to. His home insurance is not our responsibility. And I feel that he has no grounds on evicting our family. We will be moving in 4-5 months due to the military, and we are not willing to move before then.      I guess the real question is, what can we do?

20090128153621AA9Y4Re	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	How many  Cover Letters should I write  ?	I would like to apply for two positions in the same organization and they both have different requirements.  So how many cover letters I should write ? Because I have heard that I should always write one cover letter tailored to that specific position.    This is where the dillemma is: I have to paste the Cover Letter (CL)  in the box. Once I apply for the first position, I have to paste the accompanied CL in the box. Now when I apply for the 2nd position,  I have to  delete the 1st cover letter which stays in the box  and paste the 2nd cover  letter in the  box.     But if I delete the first cover letter, will the hiring agency see the first cover letter or will  they see only the cover letter that I pasted for the 2nd position?     If they don't see my cover letter for the 1st position, they will think I am applying for the 2nd position.    This is confusing

It is my last semester and I have used up all of my tuition assistance, including FAFSA and private student loans.  My credit is not great due to the fact that I screwed up on some credit cards when I was younger, so I cannot get a loan through a bank.

I would like to specialize to become a nurse anesthetist but I'm becoming overwhelmed by all the requirements to get into a program for this training.    I've already received an BS in Human Sciences and it would appear that I will need to attain a BS in Nursing before applying to a program.  Over all I'm looking at another 3-5 yrs of education before I can even apply to a program for my goal.  Then the programs are requiring 1-2yrs of critical care experience and a load of cerfications.      I'm just starting to second guess this interest.  I'm thinking I need to rethink my current education track.  Take the requirement courses I need to enter a BSN program at the community college and transfer in.  Forget trying to complete the program at this level (associates degree) and cut back some on education length.     To anyone who has gone or is going in this track with their career in nursing, how difficult was the application process?

20090128155543AAYEgJ4	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	What job should I choose?	Okay so I am confused. I am preparing for college. For a while I thought that I wanted to be an accountant but I didn't know much about it. I've researched it and it seems to be something that I'm interested in. I am still keeping my options open though. I'm not for sure if I want to be an accountant. Then I came along the idea of being a wedding planner. It is something that I am enthusiatic about, and I know that I could do it well. So I told my mom about me wanting to really be a wedding planner and she wasn't too happy. She wants me to be happy and so do I. I just think that I would enjoy wedding planning more. My mom says that with the economy these days wedding planning wouldn't be a good thing to pursue and I kind of agree. I think that she wants me to have a full time job for the rest of my life where I make good money, but I eventually want to have kids and get married and I don't want to be a full time working mom or full time stay at home mom. I want to do something that could be a tad more flexible. I am going to major in Business so I have a while to think, but I think that I am going to be a wedding planner. My mom is paying for all of my college with help of scholarships and I don't want to dissapoint her. What am I supposed to do? What might be another job that I might be intersested in. I love planning, organizing, making goals. I am good with computers and love dealing with people. Thanks.......for reading this absurdly long comment. ; )

20090128160411AAdrXRx	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Need help sorting out options to get out of debt?	We have 12,000 in school loans, about 2,000 in medical bills, 8,500 in auto loan, 4,000 in credit card debt, and 124,000 owed on our house.  With that said we will be receiving 5,000 for tax refund.  We have 3 vehicles (one that needs 2,000 in repairs that is paid off, another that is paid off and the family van that we are in the process of paying off).  We need 2 cars, so one could be sold.  We will be selling our house in the spring and living rent free in our parents house while they are away for a year while my husband goes back to school, so we could use our equity about 24,000 to pay off all debt and have less to put down on another house when we decide to buy.  What would you do in our financial situation?      Option 1:  Sell the van.  It is worth about 8,200 and we owe 8,400.  We then take the $230 car payment and put it towards paying down debt.  However, we would need 2,000 to put into the broken down car.  Or/and sell the broken down car worth $500 in it's current state.      Option 2:  Using tax return to pay off credit card debt and them some      Option 3:  When we sell the house pay it all off and have less money down on a new house when we decide to buy again.      I don't know...I see these options are right around the corner or sitting on my lap so it is nice to see a light at the end of the tunnel, but was just looking for some financial advice.

I'm applying for a specific job and I want to list my most recent, but also my most relevant, experience.

I went and opened another Roth upon finishing school. Later I was again at the bank with nothing but 300 dollars but wanted to deposit this in my Roth. The broker said I was unable to deposit funds on an IRA ROTH(Which is a lie, or else I would not have opened the account.)The broker said I needed to talk to someone else that would set me up with something I would be totally crazy about. I had no idea what was going...I felt as if I was on trial w/o anything, not even a say so. This chic set me up a Traditional IRA with a 75$ annual fee that would be freely deducted from the money every year. I ended up losing 600 or so dollars in the first 6 months I had it opened. I did not even have enough time to close the deal the two brokers made with each other.?No, the money is not refundable says the securities dept. and they are sorry but everyone is losing money in there bank accounts these days.

20090128164818AA5YSse	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Math used in Accounting????????????	ok so i am really passionate about becoming an accountant as i have taken it in both grade 11 ( 91% final grade) and this year in grade 12 (85% final mark). Accounting comes easy to me since i understand it so much. But i was told that i had to take 2 math courses so i took advanced functions and calculus. I just finished functions since i had it first semester and i bombed it ( 51% final grade) Now i'm have to take night school to boost my mark so i can be accepted to university. The problem is, in functions we mostly looked at  properties of polynomial, rational, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions. I honestly believe that this math has nothing to do with accounting. Maybe it does. So, i have calculus next semester which is just building on what we learned in functions. SO,  will the math programs that i'm taking help me at all with becoming an accountant or am i taking them because universities require them. i am asking all accountants out there, do you use this type of math at all or do u just use the basics with a little common knowledge.       Also, i live in Ontario, Canada if that helps anyone.

I'm a sophomore, and here recently I have thought about what I am to do with my life. I really like to express myself, and can easily channel this "self expression" into drawings, paintings, sculptures, ect. and writing. Which do you think is the most logical, rational one for my person, this generation?   I understand that this kind of question would be hard to answer for a person like yourself, not knowing me.      My Art:   I like to create drawings of abstract thoughts, and have considered the tattoo profession.       My Journalism:   I love to write, to think of unrealistic and realistic stories and jot them down on paper. I am getting a C in English . . . but this is because of spelling tests, I have a problem with spelling, and am working on it. My stories are great though Mrs. K., my English teacher, says she can her the passion in my written voice.      So any advice?   Anything?      Thank you oh so much,   Kelsey Lu
20090128170003AAWzjL2	Business & Finance;Credit	I had GREAT Credit, and now it's all a mess. How do you fix it?	someone attempted to take my identity in june. before that, i had great credit for my age [23]       since then, it's been harder for me to find ways of paying because i always paid online. I  can't pay online anymore because of the identity issues. The bank told me i shouldn't get checks because of my situation and that the criminal could be doing something called "check hiding."    my situation involved not only my SSN but my bank accounts, which is why the bank was involved.      So anyway, ever since then, my once great credit has gone downhill. I tried to apply for financing on a bed and I was denied a few days ago. I also tried to apply for a store credit card a few months ago, and was denied then as well.       I don't have a lot of lines of credit open.       3 store cards   1 car loan   1 cell phone bill [does that get reported to the creditors?]   car insurance       on one of the store cards, mandees, they charged me late fees because I couldn't access my bank accounts [this was during the ID teft] and couldn't pay them what they needed at that time. I told them it wasn't fair that I had to pay and the situation. They reported me to the credit bureau, and when I went to go pay it recently to clear the issue up - i was told I had a zero balance.  The charges were removed but I'm pretty sure it's on my credit report...so i was reported for charges that don't exist.      I don't know how to fix my credit, I just want to move past all this and have a decent life, one in which I can purchase a house and get a new car and whatever else I'll need to do.

There really isn't any storage for me to use aside from the closet. At first it was okay, but now it has become a burden not having access to use the closet. Before I say anything I wanted to know if I have any legal ground to stand on? Since I am renting the room and is the closet considered a part of the room? Because he would need to enter my room to get anything out of it. So I was curious what my rights are as a tenant. Does a rented room include things like closet or any storage inside of it?

Now I am a little worried that if I call the insurance company to tell them i am no longer an employee there, there will be penalty for telling them about it only now! How should I tell them about it? I have/had no claim by the way and the insurance is for real estate properties (rental Business). I just don't want them to update I lied or something and then i will not be able to get insurance at all, not even from other companies or at least not for a good price - that is my main concern. Is it better to come to their office to explain the situation instead of calling!? Any advice how to avoid negative consequences in this case would be highly appreciated! THANKS.

On 08/08 my neighbor put up a fence without senting me anything in writing prior to installation. I have not seen any estimates or what matetial will be used for this project.  On 1/09 I got a certified mail letter demanding money for 1/2 fence cost, or I will be sued.  He claims that according to Idaho State Statute "35-1003", if it's required for protection of the rights and interest of one party that a partition fence be made between them, the other, when notified, must proceed to erect, one -half (1/2) of such partition dence, on the line of said land. And if, after notice given in writing, either party fails to erect and complete, wihin six (6) months time thereafter, one-half (1/2) of such dence, the party giving the notice may proceed to erect, the entire partition fence and collect by law one-half (1/2) the costs of such fence from the other party, and he has a lien upon the land thus partitioned.   You can not just build something without letting the other party know in writing.  What can I do about this? Please help.

20090128180250AAYKYvR	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can I break my lease at my apartment due to noisy neighbors?	I have been living at my current apartment for 6 months now and since moving in, I have had problems with the tenants above me. They have a dog that constantly barks that wakes me up at 5 AM every morning. They also let the dog out on the deck at 6 AM to urinate which then drips down on my deck causing a very unpleasant smell.  They also sometimes play loud music late at night which keeps me awake. I have always been VERY healthy until moving in here and have had numerous viral and bacterial infections since moving in here. I have also been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder since moving in which has made me a nervous wreck. I believe all these problems are derived from the stress and lack of sleep since living here. I have made several complaints to the property manager and have even called Seattle Animal Control a few times and the problem still occurs. I have a lot of documentation and neighbors who are willing to vouch for me. Is there anything I can do to get out of the lease?
