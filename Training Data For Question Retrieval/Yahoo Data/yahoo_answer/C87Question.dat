20090309132039AAva1hb	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	If I'm driving 57 in a 55 mph zone, and someone going 99 mph crashes into me, am I at fault?	Apparently, people think it's OK to go much, must faster than the speed limit, as long as they go to traffic school or as long as they pay the ticket.  In fact, 9 times out of 10, people think they can get out of the ticket because the officer wrote down the wrong address, the sun was shining at the wrong angle, the speed limit sign was tilted at an odd angle, or the officer wasn't wearing his hat.      Meanwhile, I'm pretty sure that even if I'm going just a few miles over the speed limit, I could get pulled over, arrested, and beaten or Tasered if the officer thinks I'm enough of a criminal.      So, to all of you people who think speeding is OK, would I be at fault if you smashed into me when going 30 mph or more faster than the speed limit?  I'm far from being a perfect driver, so I'm sure some police officer would find a way to find me at fault.

The instrucctions say:   By law, the required vaccines include: mumps, measles,   rubella, polio, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, pertussis,   influenza, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenzae type B,   varicella, pneumococcal, rotavirus, hepatitis A,   meningococcal, human papillomavirus, zoster, and any other   vaccinations recommended by the Advisory Committee for   Immunization Practices (ACIP).

20090309131909AAP64Ut	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I believe I have been violated by the legal system.?	I believe I have been violated by the legal system.               After becoming older and slightly ill, I was deceived by my physician husband who sent me to “recuperate. He assured me I would “feel’ better in sunny California away from the bitter cold of northern Montana. He was my doctor so following his orders I went to my daughters in California. ”.  Upon returning home I found he had divorced me, moved in my replacement and left me homeless and penniless.  He claimed I had deserted my marriage, although it was his idea.         I found an attorney who was willing to take the case with very little money in advance. I was assured we would get a “equitable division of property "  The attorney neglected to file the required papers in a timely fashion. She told me she “forgot” The judge found in favor of my ex-husband.       So now I feel like I was not only violated by a husband who was bored with me but by a judicial system that didn’t care about me.  Is there any chance this can be made right? Are lawyers or judges held accountable to people?  Is it possible the lawyer or the judge was paid by my ex-husband and his new wife? Do I have any rights here? I am looking for advice on what my next step should be, or am I just out all those years of marriage. I was left with what I took in my suitcase to my daughters.

I understand the need for military recruits to be healthy and free of any health problems, however, I notice that some members of the military smoke.      I often notice this because there are two military recruiting offices next door to each other near my house (army and navy respectively) and sometimes the recruiters step outside for a smoker's break.      Now, I'm not trashing on smokers or anything but how can the military recruit the healthiest and strongest individuals and yet overlook the unhealthiness of smoking?        And yes, this question is coming from a non-smoker.

Why do we have to sign a slip when the drawer is short or over? Is it fair? I think that the register operator should only be at fault if they steal the money. Shortages and overages are going to happen sometimes -- people make mistakes. You only will be audited when your drawer has a shortage of $20 or more. Last year, we had a drawer shortage of $60.38. All three of us had to sign a Register Audit Form. Is it that serious? A store that does over $200,000 in sales a day getting worked up about $60.38? No one stole the money. Sharing registers is dangerous. It was just -$60.38. It's not going to kill the store. Another cashier had a shortage. Her drawer was short by $317. No harm done. Mistakes happen, but they should not happen all the time. Which reminds me, where the hell is our bonus? We haven't got one for 2 years!!
20090309133059AAx8DDg	Politics & Government;Politics	Why does the Obama administration back immunity for the author of Bush torture memos?	In legal arguments before a federal court in San Francisco Friday, the Obama administration stepped in to defend one of most notorious figures in the Bush administration, John Yoo, author of legal memoranda used to justify torture and indefinite detention without trial as part of the "war on terror."   The intervention makes clear that the Obama administration opposes any serious effort to shed light on the attacks against democratic rights carried out by its predecessor or to hold any officials of the previous administration accountable for their actions. Moreover, its court interventions amount to a defense of the Bush administration's assertions of quasi-dictatorial presidential powers.   So clear is the continuity between the Bush and Obama administrations in this area that the Wall Street Journal published an editorial Friday, headlined, "Obama Channels Cheney," hailing the new administration's stand on warrantless wiretapping. "The Obama Justice Department has adopted a legal stance identical to, if not more aggressive than, the Bush version," the newspaper's right-wing editorial board gloated.    http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/mar200...

Most people argue about the moral issue of cloning embryos and destroying them to use their stem cell lines, and are opposed to such research.  But, is anyone opposed to ALL stem cell research?  I am including adult stem cells in this.      Sometimes, I worry that we, as a species, are so focused on finding new ways to cheat death and suffering, that we are okay with "playing God" to do so.  With "playing God", I am referring to any use of stem cells in any artificial way (i.e. to re-grow body parts/tissue that has been destroyed and is not naturally grown to do a job).      NOTE:  I am not necessarily against stem cell research, but I am most certainly on the fence about it.  And all I really want to do is open a dialogue about it - I don't need to hear a sob story or a bunch of insults to my intelligence, moral character, or political viewpoint.  Just dissociate yourself from the emotion of the debate, and let your mind speak.

20090309145648AA7pmDs	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is it illegal to sleep on Skid Row?	I heard Skid Row in Los Angeles is one of the poorest places or at least one of the most compacted places in the country with homeless people sleeping on the streets. Is that illegal? I guess sleeping anywhere other than official shelters would be illegal because homes are considered private property and benches and parks and paved streets are considered public property so either way someone owns where we stand, sit, and lie because the government officials (cops) patrol parks, street sweepers clean streets, and people own houses when they buy up homes and pay the annual note. Still you'll likely hear of thousands of people or even see them just sleeping on benches or in alleys and no one arrests them. Someone commented before that maybe there are so many homeless people that the cops don't even bother anymore. I mentioned that because I posed a question before about sleeping in parks and was told that everyone has to leave after it closes and you need a permit to stay there. If they are sticklers about parks I wouldn't be shocked if the law enforcement started requiring permits for people to sleep anywhere; bus stop benches, subways, alleys, anywhere other than an shelter or a house (the only free place being a shelter). Okay the other free place is a prison or jail cell but that has a lot of negative stigma attached to it. They feed you and give you a place to stay but you have this violation next to your name that scares people away from you and plus I think jail and prison is associated with evil and hatred and violence and everyone staying there being angry and volatile. Other than that it is almost like law enforcement doing some people a favor giving them a place to stay and food to eat: if people look at jail and prison like that it's not really that bad. I guess part of it is they don't like the idea of being jobless, having no money, and being locked in a building with a bunch of angry people who yell and harrass each other and then having violations on paper next to their names that say everyone in society (the civilization of the town or city) must stay away from him because he is a "bad" person.

20090309144720AAvd5Eg	Politics & Government;Military	Media in the Navy can it be that good!?	Well to start out I am 21 years old and I work at a News Broadcast station as a videographer and editor. I noticed that the Navy is hirering in Tampa for just those postions but I am a bit skeptical.       I talked to the recruitter and he assured me that I would not have to leave the country, and that I would never be near conflict. I would get a m-f, 9-5 work day and basically just do exactly what I do now, produce the news but for the Navy. My wife and I would be eligible for on base housing or housing in town. I would recieve all the benefits and I would start out around 30k/yr. Of course all of this sounds AMAZING, for my career and my family.      I am just worried about being lied to and taken advantage of. Is all of this true, could it really be that good? I do not want to enlist and then be forced to leave the country or move or be seperated from my wife. I have real professional experience in just the field they are looking for. I would love to be apart of the Navy broadcasting and obviously love to recieve the benefits that come with it. But I refuse to be lied to and taken advantage of and jeopradize my family and life.      Can anyone please give me insight on this?      Thanks in advance,   JPD

I guess Newt Gingrich isn't hot enough to sit at Limbaugh's "cool table" in the cafeteria.  LOL!   "I'm frankly getting tired of talking about Newt. I mean, it's a pointless exercise," Limbaugh said of Gingrich.  "I'm surprised by nothing when I'm dealing with people in the media who think they're in politics. ... They are fly-by-night operators, and most of them stand for nothing until they see a poll about what the American people want, and then they go out and try to say one way or another what the American people want while trying to falsely hold onto an ideology at the same time — and you can't count on them."   "They're running TV ads against me. Newt Gingrich wishes they were running TV ads against him."   Reminds me of that movie "Mean Girls".

(I'm Hispanic, and we have long names)      I'm 15, 16 in April 4th. I want to change it to Sierra Lydia Alexander.      My Reason...: My parents didn't name me, a nun did after her sister, and I don't even know her! I hate long names, Luciann is a mess, I try to go by Edith but it's not enough. I hate my dad with passion, and that lastname reminds me every bit of him >:-( and my first name was unheard of practically until Jessica Alba became so well known.      Why I want the new name: I love the name Sierra means mountain, which is my favorite view of nature, and it's originally Spanish but known in the US. Lydia is a gorgeous name and in my opinion flows nicely. Alexander is a last name I can really live with, and I would like to give my baby also when she's born (July1st).      My mom and step dad will say yes, so, How can I change my name if i'm a minor? Some more information:      I'm becoming a US citizen this year, the last name Alexander is NOWHERE in my family and i'm not marry or know anyone who's last name is Alexander.
20090309163533AAgJnTU	Politics & Government;Politics	What party am I???????	Your Resolved QuestionShow me another ?        What party am I      The Economy:   Lower spendings   A tax system that is between progressive and flat   Lower corporate taxes to create more jobs   Removal of subsidies.   Stimulas Package-It may work but I have doubts. They tried this in Japan in teh 1990's and it didnt work. This might increase our national debt. We will have to see.      Health Care:   I would like a universal system but its going to be hard to set up that. A universal system will increase taxes and decreases the amount of choices. Hopefully I can establish a system where universal health is available to those who cant afford private sectors. Those who can afford more should apply in the private sectors-more choices and hopefully less taxes.      Welfare: This should be limited to those who are handicapped. The rest should go get a job.  Workfare for the able bodied who are poor      Education: Promotion of School Choice. We have been spending money for school and this has gotten us no where. Spending money isnt enough. We need School choice. This way, the schools will be forced to provide good-quality education which would result in better standards.      Defense: We should not spend excessive money on the military but just enough to ensure national security. The Iraq War is a waste of time and I think we should graduately pull out. I support the overall war on terrorism.      Immigration: If one is not in this country legally, he/she should get out. That is the law.      Social Issue:   Marriage: We should have civil unions for everyone rather than marriage. This include the homosexuals. Those who want marriage should get it from their church/religious institution.      Abortion: Only during the first trimester, otherwise, it should be consider illegel.      Prostitution: There is no point in the gov. interfering in that   Porn: See prostituion above.   Support separation of church and state and individual freedoms.      also, I dont support israel.      what political party of I?   Am I a Democrat, Republican, Independent, Libertarian, Socialist ect.   If you do not wish to vote for me, tell me why?      im 16 years old

First to help I drive a 98 four banger S-10, it would take me the two miles to get up to 67 ( what he said I was doing in a 55) and she was in a Buick SUV much bigger than me and obviously hid the cop from me so I would imagine me from him since I didn't pull over until I noticed the guy in font of me pulling over. The question, is that bull that he could even do it and should I waste a day of work to argue it in court being that it's my word against his.

20090227152703AA5JCd4	Politics & Government;Embassies & Consulates	Messed around regarding Passport office job and retraction of job offer, please help.?	Well, in mid-november I received a letter congratulating me on passing the interview-and gaining a civil service job providing my security checks and references were satisfactory.  I left my previous job at the end of December, as, every time I spoke to someone at HR there they would keep me updated with how my application was coming along.  Every time I rang them up they would lead me to believe that the checks wouldn't take much longer.  A few days ago however (end of Feb), I receive a letter explaining that unfortunately all the positions were now filled and I would be placed on a merit list for 6 months but as the recession is occuring nothing might happen.  Ringing up, I was apologised to by a rather unapologetic member of HR but they said this happens.  I am more annoyed about the fact that I could have gone for other jobs but I was given hope every time I rang up that the job would start soon, and I was pleased as this would be the best job I could ask for.  They said that my references and checks were good.  Do I have any rights here? I was dealt with in a very unprofessional way that has ultimately made me lose out on a job. Are the government allowed to shaft everyone because they have the power? I am aware of a recession happening, a 2 year old child is too, so why advertise jobs knowing you can't take the people on, don't they have economists for this sort of thing? Sorry I'm ranting now...any experiences or help would be much appreciated thanks :)

Not all change is for the better. I'll turn in my guns when he proves he was and still is a native citizen. Not born in Kenya as relatives and officials there claimed, not having surrendered citizenship in order to attend school in Indonesia. Not having travelled to the UK from USA on a foreign student visa, or attended college with foreign aid. All things he has refused to document.

There's a little random patch of grass and dirt down the road from me, and my friends and I like to go down there on our bikes and go off jumps there.. And usually it's just me, Nate, and Downs.. But today Nate's brother, Sky was out there too.. And Downs and Sky don't get along to well.. And Sky started teasing me to the point where I got a little more than annoyed with him.. And then when I was walking down the hill he tripped me.. Now Sky and I are friends, and he just likes to annoy people.. So I didn't worry about it too much.      Well, I didn't worry about it too much until Downs flew out of my peripheral vision, and pinned Sky, and started screaming at Sky to leave me alone. And after he let him up, without hurting him or anything, Sky went home.      And then Sky came back with an axe and literally /chased/ after Downs until Downs hopped back on his bike and took off, while Nate and I carefully wrestled the axe away from him.       ... Sky and I have been friends for about three years.. Really good friends, too. But lately he's been really angry/aggressive.. With anyone who even slightly irritates him..

20070809215809AARXEVf	Politics & Government;Immigration	Clearing the air over illegal immigration?	I have a few points I want people to answer me on.  The most common arguments I see here are:   1. Europeans came illegally   2. Illegals do work Americans won't   3. America stole land from Mexico      Let me just ask a few questions.  (1) How did Europeans come here illegally if there was no government set up.  There were no immigration laws at all.  It's not illegal if there are no laws to govern the act.  (2)  If illegals do work Americans won't, how did we ever survive?  This country has been here for 300 years and the sudden rush of illegals has only happened recently.  Oh that's right, Americans did those jobs, not illegals.  If we did them then, why not now?  (3)  America DID NOT steal land from Mexico.  We fought for it and won.  Mexico signed the land over to the U.S. fair and square.  Last time I checked, that wasn't stealing.  So my question is, how do you argue against those points?

All of it should have went on this months bonus check but when he got it today it was only about 200 more then usual. They had a good month though to so the extra submission may not be on there at all. He said he did way more then 20K worth of submissions and it should have been a lot more and the owner is more then likely just didn't include it on his pay check and screwed him and a few others out of a lot of money.

I've recently moved into a new apartment and the tenats in the adjacent apartment have complained of a slight smoke oder in the corner of their kitchen.  To rectify this situation, I have agreed to smoke the majority of the time outside.  I am disabled and I'm not able to go outside all the time due to weather and time of night.  Despite my efforts the tenants have still complained about the oder.  The other day I received a notice that stated that I was no longer permmited to smoke in my apartment, and that if I did, I would be evicted.      I do not have a non smoking clause in my lease and the building I live in is not designated as non smoking residency.  The landlord has not made any attempt to resolve the issue.  There are 12 windows in my apartment and all are stuck/painted shut and cannot be opened.  Can I be evicted even if don't have non smoking clause in my lease? Do to my disability, does the landlord need to make reasonable accommidations for my disability and solve the issue of smoke going into the other apartment? Were can I find update information on evictions for smoking in the absence of a non smoking clause?

20090309175412AAd0Y99	Politics & Government;International Organizations	Does this idea sound crazy, or what?	I was recently on a Luke 18 retreat. We began to discuss one world currency. My friend seems to think it could lead to the end of the world. His theory is so close to true, that it is kind of scary. Take a listen.      (First, I am a Catholic. Most of this theory deals with the Holy Bible. Please do not religious flame here. I respect your different religions, please respect mine.)      The Bible speaks of the beast (satan, the anti-Christ) at the end of the world. It says that those who accept the mark of the beast will be doomed to hell, but those who do not accept the mark will be cast out from society. I know what you're thinking...what does this have to do with one world currency? Well, one world currency could be used through a marking system, possibly a printed bar code or tattoo that will be printed on the body to be scanned and used as your money system. This could be the sign of the beast. And like the Bible says, those who do not accpet this sign will be marked out of society. (meaning if you do not take it, you will not be able to buy things.) After this one world currency and new world order is developed, the Christ will return in a blaze of glory and will fight of satan. He (Jesus) will find those with the mark and damn them. He will find those without, and bring them up with him.      This theory is very scarry because it is very possible that it could become a reality. This is strictly my friend's theory, not mine. sure, OOC (one world currency) may not be used by marking of the body) but it is possible. What do you think about this? Will OOC end us?      (This is my friends theory, again. please do not think I'm crazy....blame him!)      As a final question, do you think OOC will hapen? Please give an opinion about both the theory and if OOC will even take affect.

Call your two Senators today and tell them to vote NO on the Obama/Pelosi/Reid $410 billion Omnibus that increases spending by another 8% and funds 8,500 pork barrel earmarks at a time when hundreds-of-thousands of Americans are losing their jobs. The number at the Senate switchboard is 202-224-3121.      In a nutshell the Obama budget      Spends more than any budget in American history and admits to a $1.75 trillion deficit.   Creates a "Cap and Trade" system that is an ENERGY TAX on Americans.  The Obama budget admits this tax will be at least $645 billion in the first 8 years alone.  Prices will go up on gasoline for cars, energy to heat and cool your home.  Prices will increase on just about every good you buy -- from food to consumer goods because of the higher energy costs to grow the food and make the goods.    Combined with the Stimulus, the Obama budget brings back the old social welfare system that trapped so many Americans in despair while wasting billions.         I’m asking you to educate yourself and friends on this Obama budget.       http://www.americansforprosperity.org/       Isnt education the key? Shouldnt we know everything we can about things?

20090309130844AADrsHR	Politics & Government;Politics	What would you consider a viable, cost effective health care plan?	No reasonable person wants to deny health care to anyone in need.  However, it appears to me that the government is assuming that every single man, woman & child is in dire need of these services.      Since medical care is imperative for those in need, why won't the government trash all unnecessary pork from the budget and use these funds as their 1st priority.      The majority of the U.S. population are healthy.  I raised four children who always received their shots, were treated for a broken bone from falling from a tree or maybe a sore throat, etc.  None of my children, myself or my husband ever had to be hospitalized.  The same is true for all of the families I have known all these years.  Therefore, I believe, this should be considered.        This way there will not be rationing, long waits for appointments, lower insurance costs for the healthy and those with serious and continuing medical needs can be taken care of through good government programs.      Health care for children is necessary but why don't they take into consideration the fact that children need fruits, vegetables and balanced meals, good hygiene, more physical activity by at least mandating it in schools again.  However, the price of fruits, vegetables, milk, bread, cereal and other proteins are beyond the reach of the average family.  These costs will only escalate when the carbon tax is imposed and transportation costs will be passed on to the consumer.  We keep hearing about the growing obese children and population but their main diet is composed of high carb and junk food.      People with AIDS, MS, Hepatitis, Sickle Cell Anemia, Diabetes must have help and all deserve the best treatment available.  Their prescription costs should be based on ability to pay.  At present many life threatening diseases are not covered by local health departments and yet, we are spending billions on abortions for the whole world, billions for AIDS & other STD's to many other countries.  We need to take care of our own problems first.  Compassion is great but 'charity should begin at home'.      I'm by no means an economist but I just feel there must be a better way.  In my view the government just doesn't look at reality and eventually they make circumstances worse & screw it up entirely.  Just like they did with S.S., Medicare & Medicaid.  Now they have to redo these programs and it will end up costing us more and getting less.  They spent these funds on their other pet projects for all these years and now it's on the brink of disaster.      Just your opinion please.

"It was hard for me to believe that you were entirely serious about that socialist question," he told reporters, who had interviewed the president aboard Air Force One on Friday.      Opening the unusual presidential call to reporters by saying that there was "just one thing I was thinking about as I was getting on the copter," he said it wasn't he who started the federal government's intervention into the nation's financial system.       http://washingtontimes.com/weblogs/joe-c...

Ill give you an example as to what I define to be a backward society.   Image - Body image, facial image and whatever else there is, we as a society have become obsessed with how we look. Females are expected to have the perfect image, porn star breast, small waist, long legs and a clear face. How many people are really like that. I was reading about how some young girls become suicidal due to wanting to look like this - an image the media has helped to sell or having breasts that they think are unattractive. Now I don't think this is in anyway progressive and as someone who may be considered liberal I find this idea disgusting. I find strip clubs, gentlemens club and pornography sick and not in any sense liberal.

They have given him full time hours for several months now but have not given him the postion change or whatever else they are supposed to do to consider him full time. His schedule goes like this: Sun6a-2p Sat6a-2p Mon2p-10p Tues10p-6a Wed10p-6a Th&Fri off. Don't get me wrong we are very grateful to have jobs but he has repeatedly asked his boss to change the schedule as the third shifts are so disruptive to his sleeping and actually cause him to technically have 1 1/2 days off since he is still sleeping on the first of the two days off. And, combined with the first shift on his next day off that means that he has a hard time getting back to sleep to get the necessary sleep before working again, and it feels like a vicious cycle. It is effecting our quality of life, and I don't think he is even getting the extra overnight pay either. Is there a crappy schedule law or something else that would apply to this? Or some advice? Thank you in advance.

20090309130306AA6pVk7	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How would I claim land behind my property?	To the rear of my property there is derelict land that used to support garages owned by the council.  They have now been knocked down for approximatly 5 years and no one maintains this land.      Behind this land is a field thats joins it but is seperated with a fence.        What steps would I need to take for me to eventually own this land?      Also 3 of my neighbours back onto this land.  There would be no dispute as we would just need to all extend backwards.

20090309134246AAOcYF9	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can my boss really get away for not telling the truth in my unemployment case?	He's basically saying that I quit but the truth was that he was short on money & sat down with me & communicated about my layoff. It was a verbal agreement. As intimidated as I already am with stress from the economy too, he is telling EDD or unemployment services that I quit. The problem is that I made a mistake by sending a arrogant letter to the whole team that I was hired somewhere else just to even out my layoff. I know they are going to use this letter against me but what can I do to protect me from this injustice? Do I deserve this? Any help will be appreciated and please be honest. Thank you.
20090309134839AAKmTtY	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	My apartment complex is trapping me in my lease! Help please!?	I've lived here for 2 years, and my lease is up May 1st.  They sent me notice to renew and I did not submit it ASSUMING that I was not going to renew.        They explained that the lease states that they need 60 days notice if we are to NOT renew.        So as of today, I'm giving them 51 days notice, and am automatically renewed for another YEAR.  If I want to break this renewal, it will cost me 3 months rent. That's about $3,000.      I don't have a job, I'm living off of savings. I'm a college student and barely keeping my head above water as it is.         What are my options?       Thanks to anyone with sound advice.

Seriously, do you consider that you elected a "man" into office that can look his children in the eyes and say "I support ending the lives of people like you"?  Barack Obama encourages woman to have abortions on the taxpayer dollar. He condones destroying the most vulnerable lives, what kind of "man" would support something like that?  I am an atheist, so save your "religious nutcase" responses.
