WuskPQ6Qaa	You need to make them check for your spine you could have a slight curve in your spine which can cause all of this, it could be a disease in your abdomen, or it could just be stomach gas, but what you've described sounds very serious, so I suggest you explain to the doctor everything you explained here|`|ON84EQaBaa	sounds like gas.
VCIZJQCJaa	2 years is a long time to be in pain it might be that you have a cold and just got over another.you might also have the flu on top of everything else.drink lots of fluids so you don't dehydrate try not to eat anything greasy of spicy.do you have a thermometer?see if you have a fever.this double cold has taken it's toll on your immune system.when you get over this episode start on a healthy diet eat plenty of fruits and vegetables take vitamin c and a vitamin pill.i think you really need to start building up you immune system,.but not now just get well for now.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	This sounds like a disease I have called Chron's.  It took them forever to find it in me to.  Ask them to test or look for that.

But talk to your doctor because it requires meds.|`|blqaXArhaa	Hmmm... abdominal pain? It sounds like appendicitis but you wouldn't have that for 2 years. Maybe you should ask your doctor about that.

So take care ..|`|AA11434633	We have a different breed of dog, a Yorkshire Terrier crossed with a Jack Russell Terrier, that's been diabetic for about 3 years now.  In fact, it was my own recognition of the symptoms of diabetes (I'm a type 1 diabetic) that got me to test a sample of her urine.<br>  <br>  The test showed the presence of glucose so my wife immediately contacted our local vet.  The receptionist/nurse there told my wife not to panic as it was different in dogs, compared to humans.  I didn't believe this, so did some online research for myself.  Within about half an hour I telephoned the vet's surgery and requested that I be allowed to speak with the vet herself.  She agreed with me that the receptionist/nurse should not have offered that information as she was wrong.  We were requested to take our dog (the middle one of three that we have) to the surgery immediately ... which we did.<br>  <br>  She was started, straight away on insulin injections, just as soon as the vet had taken a blood sample and tested the blood for the presence of glucose.<br>  <br>  Our beautiful baby is now on two injections a day, and a controlled diet.  We have to make sure she's not stealing her sisters' food.  (They're not actually sisters.  That's just the way that I refer to them.)<br>  <br>  On talking to our vet, we are led to believe that diabetes is not so rare as you might think.  Sadly, many cases are not discovered until such time as a pet ... be that cat or dog ... is seriously ill.<br>  <br>  Just as with humans, diabetes can have several conditions that accompany it, and without due diligence, complications can easily set in, causing untold suffering.  Our poor baby already has severe cataracts in both eyes and can barely see where she's walking ... often walking into things, such as doors left ajar, broom handles, when the broom has fallen over, etc.<br>  <br>  We visit our vet every 2 or 3 months for blood samples to be taken and sent away for analysis ... as well as giving an immediate blood glucose reading.<br>  <br>  Our baby is 12 years of age now, and we'll, hopefully, have a few more years yet with her.  (I'm a big soppy git that cries when pets pass over.)<br>  <br>  I do hope that you find it easy to learn how best to take care of your Labrador mix baby.
mAp90hEeaa	You should be using your inhaler regularly on a scheduled basis while ill.  Taking tylenol or ibuprofen (motrin/advil) on a regular basis for fevers/body aches.  Rest as much as possible.  Dramatically increase your daily water intake.  Run a humidifier in the bedroom where you sleep.  All of these will help.|`|HWEjZ6tCaa	Take 2 tylernol (tylenol is best if you have any nausea) every 4-5 hours to ease fever and aches. Mucinex helps with conjestion and coughs. Also, take 2 puffs of your inhaler ever 4 hours (or as prescribed for wheezing- i'm just reading off of mine). Also, lots of water (gatorade if you are naseous- the calories in gatorade should keep you from getting sick)|`|461411165b47f11271f6827674ccc7ddaa	Drink plenty of fluids, take paracetamol to ease the aches and pains and if you are congested try inhalng steam from a bowl of boiling water with a towel over your head. You can add a few drops of obus oil or cvick to the water if you like.

No3VoDCqaa	Hi, don't worry, what you're describing doesn't sound like anything serious.  It is most likely caused by the tearing of small blood vessels on the surface of the rectum and that is why it burns, and because it is a fresh cut, that's occured as you poop, the blood is bright red and visible on the stool and it happens each day because it hasn't had time to heal, and each time you pass a stool it starts to bleed again.  <br>  <br>  At 13 years old you are very very unlikely to have colon cancer, and colon cancer related bleeding is typically different to what you've described - the blood is dark red/brown colour, often foul smelling and not usually associated with any pain/burning.<br>  <br>  Whereas with piles/haemorrhoid related bleeding, which is caused by vessels in the lower rectum, like in your case i suspect, the blood is bright red, and painful and on the stool and often on the tissue paper too.<br>  <br>  However, if it persists, or you are feeling unwell, you should see your doctor, and ask a parent for advice - there are medications that can help - for example you could use a stool softener to reduce the pressure on the rectum and allow the cuts to heal.<br>  <br>  I know it's an embarrassing thing to talk about, but at some point in everyone's life it will happen, it's very common.<br>  <br>  Best wishes, jim|`|b3a0ff51ff5abf43910afdf0478e30f0aa	Could also be a hemorrhoid tell a parent and go to the doctor,|`|nqFAFkWtaa	f it s serious u need to go to the doctor have a check-up to know wat s it okey,,for u to prevent f its rele a probz.|`|OQRlcIvzaa	Uh, you might have dysentary, colon issues, or intestinal issues.

ZcfZx60aaa	You need to go to see your doctor. It could be a number of things: lower GI bleed, cancer, colitis, worms, etc.<br>  You doctor will test the stool and do other tests to find out whats wrong. <br>  Don't delay!|`|RKw56KZaaa	It's probably a hemorrhoid, did you do any heavy lifting or really exert yourself?|`|mAp90hEeaa	This occurs when you try to poop out some hard stool.  It makes a tiny tear in the lining of your rectum and bleeds.  These usually seal themselves up without any treatment except for keeping your stools more soft by increasing your daily water intake and your intake of fresh fruits and vegetables.  You can go to WebMd.com and type in the search line "constipation" and read up on suggestions on how to keep your stools more soft so this won't happen again.|`|MteOgApuaa	You need to definitely get to a doctor. It could be nothing, but could also be serious.

1PLFUli0aa	hey hun, I am 23 years old and diagnosed with type 1 at age 8! sometimes highs can sneak up on you. when I am having my period, my sugar goes crazy during that week! so that could have something to do with it. or you have eaten something this week that affected your blood sugar this week. (peanuts were my weakness, and I didn't realize how much they spiked my sugar until I quit eating them!) Stress has a lot of effect on blood sugar also. If I have a stressful week, I will have crazy highs and lows. <br>  <br>  If you will figure out what is stressing you, or what you have changed in your diet, it will help. these things do happen, and if keeps on like this, see your doctor. I would bet that it is either stress, diet change, or cycle related! <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|S7TVjfmQaa	You didnt say which kind of insulin you use and what do you do when you are high .But what is related to me when I get cold my insulin dose is not enough and I should increase it. sometimes my BS is high so I INCREASE MY ACTRAPID INSULIN HERE NOVOLOG BUT I dont get enough carb so I HAVE A LOW BS .With a little play with the ratio of insulin to carb I control my B SUGAR.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Could be from an illness that you recently had, infection, or just need a change in the dosage of you insulin.

I am guessing that your insulin to carb ratio needs adjusting.  You need to count your carbs accurately (even if this means weighing and measuring stuff) and then take your insulin BEFORE you eat.  Write down what you eat and how much insulin you took.  Check your sugar 2-3 hours after you eat.  Write down all the data.  You may find patterns of certain foods bringing you way high up or down.  You may need to adjust your insulin to carb ratio for different times a day.  Also, your insulin to carb ratio may need to be tweaked on weekends as opposed to weekdays.  My son is 16 and he is on an insulin pump.  His insulin to carb ratio changes throughout the day and once we got that figured out he's had waaaay more good numbers than bad.  He keeps a log every day to look for patterns and adjusts as needed.<br>  <br>  Another suggestion, is to see a different doctor if that 's an option.<br>  We work with a wonderful diabetes educator in addition to the endocrinologist.  Please check out www.integrateddiabetes.com - they can help you get  your numbers in control (but this is not free).  He's in the Philadelphia suburbs, even if you are not in Philly he does remote help on line.  He's a type 1 diabetic himself so he really understands what you are going through.<br>  Good data and good diabetes control go hand in hand.|`|mAp90hEeaa	This is usually caused by an illness or infection.  If you have a cold, sinus congestion, cough, symptoms of a urinary tract infection, sore throat - all will throw your blood sugar levels off.  It can even be a minor illness but your body is trying to fight it off, thus the wildly fluctuating levels.  Might be time for a check-up with your doctor.

RvddYKqjaa	I think they work when there are less visitors in the hospital. Most hospitals try to work around visitors. They really don't stay in one spot that long. Hospital staff awakens you all night too. I don't see that it's a very big deal. People don't usually stay in the hospital that long and they can go home and sleep. <br>  The hospital administration makes this schedule for a reason, and I can't think of another reason why they should change it. I don't think it harms anyone.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	They shouldn't use them when patients are trying to sleep.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	i see your point, because i not only work for a hospital but ive had 22 surgeries and at least 20 ive had to spend at least one night at. i think it is rude and inconsiderate of these people to do their jobs at night (no ok that sounded wrong) because there ARE graveyard shifts so i really cant say anything about that.....BUT the one thing that patients can do is call the nurse and have them close the door..BUT another thing that i know plenty about is that no matter what, you never get any sleep in the hospital anyway. all that medication, the IV drip, your own machines going off at night, AND the nurses coming in to check on you every hour or two.....its kind of a lose lose situation... now speaking on the side of actually working at a hospital (which i do) like i said before people are just doing their jobs and should not be punished for having the graveyard shift.. sometimes the best times to do things is in the middle of the night...and people have to get paid some time....so here are both sides of the situation...i agree but then again i disagree

Some people need to keep switching sides to avoid getting bedsores from sleeping on one side and some people prefer one side to the other.  Apparently far more people sleep on their right side than their left side.  A survey that I came across last year found that of all the people who sleep on their side something like 87% sleep on their right side and only 13% sleep on their left side.  The survey did not suggest a reason for this big difference.  Perhaps right handed people prefer their right side and left handed people prefer their left side.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	ive been sleeping on my left side since i can remember...and i have had no medical conditions (as far as my heart is concerned) so i think its an old wives tale|`|dOix26N3aa	I've been doing it since I was a kid - and I'm 49 now.

Fortunately I was able to overcome mine when I became sexually active, I found myself in some post sex situations where I had to go and could not. butt Finally overcame these issues now to the point that I can let someone Else hold my penis while I urinate.

If you tell your anesthesiologist, or ANYBODY that is going to sedate you for ANYTHING that you have that reaction, they won't give you the drug.<br>  <br>  I'm surprised they didn't just reverse the midazolam (generic name for Versed).<br>  <br>  You may have similar reactions to Valium, Ativan and other drugs in the same class (benzodiazepines)<br>  Here's a list:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_benzodiazepines" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ben...</a>|`|c55O7jqXaa	Dr. Rob is right and you need to get a copy of your medical records to find out the exact medication that did this to you so this hopefully doesn't happen again. This happens to more people than you think. It happens with other drugs too. I have this reaction to Vicodin and my pain shoots out the roof and have all sorts of side effects that are the opposite of what it is suppose to do. <br>  <br>  It is just very very important because if you do have this kind of reaction the next time it happens it may be worse. Each time you are exposed to a drug that you are allergic to the symptoms gets worse each time.|`|45qyvYU2aa	It's called a paradoxical reaction and should be noted for future surgery cases.  Just let your anesthesiologist know prior to having surgery in the future as there are different induction agents that can use.

Instead of having chips for a snack, have her eat fruit. and so on and so forth. She also has to excersize alot. Running is usually the best, but really any type of excersize is good. Check her BMI. just google BMI calculator. Being overweight has to do with height and weight not just age.<br>  Throwing up will not help her because she will be throwing up nutrients that her body needs. In order to lose her extra fat she has to workout more.

People with presbyopia have a hard time focusing up close and find themselves having to hold up reading material at arms length to focus. They may also have headaches and eyestrain when doing work close up.<br>  <br>  There are, literally, millions of sites that explain what presbyopia is (Yahoo! Search locates 2,400,000 sites that include that word.  Other search engines may locate even more), and I've included just one below.<br>  <br>  If you believe you have specific eye problems, you should see an optician for a definitive diagnosis (or diagnoses, if there is more than one problem).<br>  <br>  Be well, young sir.<br>  <br>  P.S. Having poor eyesight does NOT reduce your expected lifespan, so you CAN live with it ... unless, of course, you're stating that you have a mental health issue too.

AFi5kTiEaa	If you want to loose body fat, you need to change your diet.  If you are eating more than you used to you are probably just burning those calories.  If moderate is your comfort zone and your are doing 10 min on low intensity, you are doing 50 minutes of not really working your body that hard.  Increase the time you are riding to high for 30 minutes or more, even if you have to shorten the time on the bike.  you should be really sweating...really.  I like to run, but i do do the bike but only 15-20 minutes, after 5 minutes the sweat is poaring off of me, i go really fast, then slow it down for 30 seconds then speed it up.  so speed it up alot and you will notice a difference.  Weight training also burns fat so you should try some weight machines.(it made a huge difference for me)<br>  <br>  It sounds like you arent working out hard enough...to me.  I dont feel i have done enough unless i am really sweating.|`|cIFXxcqPaa	burning fat can be a tough task! <br>  <br>  the fast paced walk would be the best thing to loose body fat. around 3-4 miles per hour. <br>  <br>   For your diet you should try to stick with healthier stuff. vegetables wheat, not a lot of oily foods.|`|2RzEaod9aa	So you didn't change your diet, you're just eating more.<br>  You're training mostly in your comfort zone.<br>  <br>  <br>  So you eat more and you aren't challenging your body...and you're wondering why you haven't changed?<br>  <br>  <br>  Tip #1: Get over the comfort zone. You shouldn't even LOOK at your comfort zone. You should blast way past it if you ever hope to make a difference.<br>  <br>  Tip #2: Eat properly. Eating more is fine when you're exercising...you NEED to, in fact...but you need to eat properly. Eating junk isn't going to help you.

When you take them off do you still have headaches? Sometimes if you are getting used to wearing glasses this can happen. However, the only time I've had headaches from wearing glasses is when they totally messed up on the prescription lenses and made one of them way to strong for my left eye. I started seeing in 3D. Go back to the eye doctor and see if the glasses are a little too strong for you. If its too strong it makes your eyes strain to look through the lenses.

AA12144656	Been there done that!  Yes, for sure start out with the elliptical and the treadmill. Listen to your body, and if something bothers your knee switch to something else.

Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true.

MzWM9rBRaa	The actual acai berry does not promote weight loss... most of the diet products you see have other supplements in them to suppress appetite and provide more energy.  The acai berry part is designed to "flush" out your body with antioxidants.  The rest of the products are designed to help supplement weight loss.<br>  <br>  But like any supplement it won't work unless you're eating properly and getting exercise.|`|qQT8LQlKaa	Theres really a lot out there.

The only test is from the University of Florida saying that it has shown in the lab that the antioxidants it contains have fought cancer cells, especially leukemia. Otherwise, it is one of the fab diets that aren't proven to even do anything. However, users usually say that they have less of an appetitie if they include it in meals but to gain the real benefits of the berry you need to consume both the juice and pulp.|`|8ut1Hd0Maa	Hi crochetgirl I didnt have any problems with it at all and lost more or less 20lbs in a few weeks.

Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance to get rid of that belly fat (which i'm sure isn't that bad hun!! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, im not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, beccause the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain,beans, or nut ailes<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire Kosher aile has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious!<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... ummm lets see, what else? theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of carbs in it depending on which version you get.

The Vitamins A,D,E & K<br>  are Fat soluble. If you don't have Fats then these Vitamins are not absorbed by your Body and you develop deficiency. Carbs gives you energy and sense of fullness. If you don't have carbs you may tend to overeat|`|lHlFxeaCaa	Kind of...maybe. Fruits and Vegetables are loaded with water, and seriously, water is the key to weight loss. Your kidneys process your water, but also need water to function. If you're dehydrated, like most of America, you're kidneys won't be doing much, though your liver will. If you start to drink massive amounts of water, though spread it out throughout the day, you can be as thin as you want...<br>  <br>  I drink around 40 glasses of water a day, and I'm serious. I drink two glasses each 45 minutes and thats how I maintain my stability.

PCokptp9aa	The other day this happened to me, how fun?  I pulled my shirt down, and started freaking out.  I had gym next period, which could have gone horrible, or perfect.  I ran to the gym building and in the locker room and changed super fast, then I went to the bathroom and put some toilet paper down there incase any more was to leak through.  After gym, I changed into my jeans, and kept my extra long gym shirt on.  I put my shirt over top of it, and it looked fine.  Thank goodness my gym shirt is long and dark!  But if I didn't have gym, I'd go to the bathroom and do what I did, and pull my shirt down, or wrap a sweatshirt around my waist.

bFIKTjQVaa	I got all 4 of mine pulled during Thanksgiving break 2008...no turkey for me :-(  The dentist gave me some antibodies and <br>  hydrocodine for pain...I probably spelled that wrong. I was still in pain so he recommended that I take 4 moltrin along with my hydrocodine. I slept through the pain and I kept an ice pack on my mouth. <br>  <br>  My dentist gave me a "happy pill" to take the night before my appointment. He then gave me some meds to put me to sleep once I got there. You shouldn't feel too much the first day...just make SURE you take your meds as perscribed...don't wait to you're in pain. My left side healed perfectly but I had complications with my bottom right so it took a lil longer to heal. Without any complications....the whole process really isn't that bad. I actually liked my "drug comas". lol! Slept like a baby! Good Luck! :)|`|LJkPRqN0aa	i got all my teeth out at the same time, yea the first day is tough but honestly my mom bought me this head ice pack with pockets that you can put ice in that are on your cheeks. that helped with the pain AND the swelling. and i swear.....i was up and going out to places 2 days after the surgery... to me it was nothing, i took tylonal and was completely fine.... <br>  <br>  the drugs or (IV) which is what you will probably get to be put under will make you groggy for the day of the surgery but you will sleep it off. no worries (: ive had plenty of surgeries and they have all been like that but you will most likely just want to sleep anyway. so its not like you will feel "doped" like an illegal drug or something. its not bad at all.... ive had 22 surgeries and have gotten use to the feeling so im telling you its not as bad as you think. if you take one advice from me GO BUY A HEAD ICE PACK!!! that will save your life (as far as pain and swelling) ooh and also dont eat too hot or too cold things the first couple days. because that can cause dry sockets and those are not fun apparently. also DO NOT drink anything through a straw. the sucking through a straw can mess up the healing process as well...good luck and you will be fine :)|`|34b7iK7Jaa	They should give you some pain medication after the extraction. Just take those when you need them. Also it's VERY important that you take your antibiotics and anti-swelling pills.<br>  <br>  I personally got my wisdom teeth removed 2 days ago, and I only had pain on the first day. Today I'm eating pizza xD. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.<br>  <br>  When I got mine removed I had IV sedation, afterwards I wasn't tired or anything, I ran around the grocery store buying a bunch of soft foods I didn't even need. I hope your experience is just a pleasant! I only took one pain killer and all it did was make me really sleepy. The rest of the pain killers are sitting in my garbage bin. :)|`|YE3RREngaa	The drugs will probably dope you up depending on what kind you can get...talk to you doctor about what prescription you get if that is an issue for you...let him/her know what you want and he/she should help you...<br>  <br>  Also you aren't supposed to drink through a straw for a few days after because you might pull out a suture...make sure you follow your doctor's rules...|`|phcCiRncaa	They will give you something for the pain, depending on your age and the severity of the tooth.

As for a diet I say eat a good mix of fruits and vegetables with yogurts and other whole products that will make you full with less calories instead of all the bad stuff. Plus, eating bread is good for energy but too much of it will hurt you. And when all these other people say less than 2,000 calories a day that is not true at all and in fact can hurt you since when and if you start eating regularly again your body will react to it negatively and you will gain weight back really fast. Plus to preform correctly in sports you need to hold your calorie intake.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|9cBAUMnNaa	First of all girls can grow till they are like 18. Guys can grow well into their twenties. The only way to get taller is your own growth hormones. Milk will give you strong bones but no height. Your boobs might get bigger throughout your teens gradually or suddenly just get big. I had a friend who was totally flat at 14 and when she was 15 got to a C cup and now at 18 she is a DD. Mostly height and body type, size, etc. is genetic. Think about parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents and that is probably what you will end up like. One way to look taller is to have excellent posture which all you need for that is practice and good stretches and strengthening exercises for your abs and shoulders. Your ear should line up with your shoulder, shoulder with hip and knee and lastly ankles with knee and hip. Basically your whole profile should follow the same line.|`|aOJ6nTWnaa	LMAO.<br>  Drinking a lot of milk will only make you fat, and if your breast haven't started growing by 16, you're going to be a flat chested little boy for the rest of your life.

It is not the enemy, not the battleground but what goes on in your mind that determines victory or failure. The body can take a lot when extended! Over time both the physical body and mind ages. This need not be a depressing thought. The wisdom accumulated can Transcend both time and space. Great concepts and ideas lives on. Their legacy - a better world where others can stand and look further for the cycle to repeat itself. This is the true GOD - independent of religion. Think in terms of what you can give rather than what you can take. All resources are finite, that includes time and your brain.

But you sound like you are at least doing something about it.  You are seeking professional help and that's the first step.  Keep in mind that it does usually take up to 4 weeks for antidepressants to start having an effect.  In the meantime, the things I do to make myself feel ok (I don't say good, because I think that can be unrealistic sometimes if you are severely depressed) is to force myself to do things that I know I used to enjoy.  It is REALLY hard to do, but afterwards I really feel a little bit better.  Just that tiny piece of relief can be enough to get you through another day.  I also find talking about how I feel as much as possible tends to help, talk to anyone you can trust - friends, family, etc.  And remember that depression does get better, even though it feels like it will never be better.  Even without meds etc., it usually goes away after a time.  And you are hopefully speeding up that process.  So just wait it out, and hopefully things will feel ok again soon.  Good luck :)|`|TrTfowAQaa	be careful what meds you take... I was at my end and the dr wanted me to take zoloft...4 or 5 days on that and I was planning how to make my death look like an accident :o so I tossed em in the trash and got a bike. I still take valium and that helps to keep me from getting twisted up too tight. I hope you find something that's makes it feel better... maybe finding a library that does story time for little kids so you can read to them and see how happy you can make them...even something like getting a pet rat can help...they love human company and warm up to you in a short time...then you have another life depending on you...i've call suicide hotlines and that would get me through the night... just know in your heart that this too shall pass and the flowers in life will bloom again...

Your body is going through a whole lot of damage control at this point.  However, if you are breastfeeding you might want to call your ob/gyn or a lactation consultant to eliminate the possibility of duct infection or mastisis.  (If Breastfeeding)Avoid ibuprofen and stick to tylenol, it is a better option for baby as there will be slight absorption into milk.<br>  <br>  If the fever remains or gets worse by morning give your ob/gyn a call.  Better safe than sorry.

It doesn't matter whether she is a virgin or not. A woman's vagina is somewhat like a balloon. It is flexible and can expand or contract as needed. <br>  <br>  For example, if you have had regular sex but then become celibate for a long period, your vagina will become shorter and lose some of its elasticity. You will be almost like a virgin again, and when you have sex again it will be uncomfortable at first. With regular intercourse, in time the vagina will lengthen again and become more flexible.<br>  <br>  Women who have had vaginal births will be larger "down there," but no one is too large to keep a tampon inside.|`|955YoHvVaa	Yes, you can wear tampons if you are not a virgin.

You do nothing, but maybe think up a better question. Maybe a truthful one this time...in a teen category.|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	Tell your mom. I know it may seem childish, but it's always something that's always a choice. Your mom will and should confront her mom. Also, have your friend over for a few days. It'll help her.

With this situation going on, it sounds like this family is in crisis and have no reserves to cope anymore.  With an outside person intervening, they may be able to get the help that they need from a Hospice Nurse/Hospice care, some counseling so that they can continue to deal with this.  And, your friend should not be in pain.  She needs to be talking with her doctor about getting more medication for the pain.  Getting the services of Hospice can greatly help this family cope with what is going on, is the go-between for the patient and doctor so that your friend can be comfortable for however long that she has left.  You need to tell someone soon so that they can get the help and resources that they both need to get through this very difficult time.

Where are you feeling pain?<br>  <br>  The best thing I find for dealing with stress and anxiety is through physical activity.  Trying going for long walks or jogs or pick up a sport.  Maybe try yoga?<br>  <br>  Not sure if this was the kind of answer you were looking for..|`|1CgK5Le6aa	See, the urgency of your question is part of the problem. Life isn't urgent. Some of this is perspective. Your question is how to let go of tension that makes things seem urgent. First off, you have to live healthfully. Eat in the morning.<br>  <br>  Therapy might be necessary. Be wary of medication, it's another word for drugs. Be wary of drugs, as well. They only add to the problem (trust me on that). But there might be things in your past that you need to remember and deal with, a therapist can help with that.<br>  <br>  Number one. Breathe. Breathe deeper. Keep breathing. Keep breathing deeper. There are many ways to use rhythm to relax, but if the rhythm of your breath isn't there, you have bigger things than anxiety to worry about (I'll let that one sink in). Drummers lose themselves, but you can't well bring a djembe to school.<br>  <br>  There are things like yoga and tai chi that one might not be able to do in class, but the practice of which benefits all day. These will also teach you to breathe, which you can do anywhere, including school. This is the basis of meditation, and if you start meditating (which is inherent in yoga and tai chi, but can be done literally anywhere) all the better. If you don't meditate, the breathing will still help.<br>  <br>  Inhale as long and slow as you can, fill your lungs. Smoothly transition to exhaling, don't hold your breath. Exhale as completely as possible, and smoothly transition to the inhale. This might make the anxiety worse for a minute, but keep going, it will feel better. Continue this breathing until you're past the point of relaxing. <br>  <br>  There is no magic bullet. Man is run by fear, it is instinct. But it shouldn't consume your life. Also remember that you're at the heart of adolescence, you're starting to be able to understand without being able to really understand yet. It's normal. All of this is normal. Keep your chin up and breathe. Everything bad passes, sometimes it takes some time. You're learning to deal with life. It's not always easy, but it's entirely worth it. I've been through this gamut, and I can assure you when you're on the other end, it's more beautiful than you can imagine. You're climbing the rock face to a plateau, when you're out of adolescence you'll be on top. It's just a difficult climb<br>  <br>  Chinese medicine seems more capable of dealing with this than Western in my opinion, so if you can finagle that option, all the better. Tai Chi is a big part of their medicine. Any physical activity is good for this too, so start jogging, swimming, fencing, skiing, whatever. But it all boils down to deep breaths and remembering "this too shall pass". All that said, I am not a doctor. You don't want to hear it, but I do recommend you talk to one about this, and ask him what he recommends. Anxiety is a chemical reaction, all my advice will help, but I don't know what your body is doing. He will.
3R4WcWLWaa	I have gone through allot with my knee. When I was 8 I did my ACL, I had it reconstructed at 13 and blew the ligament again at 15 and now I have cartilage damage at 18. Keep ice on it for sort of half an hour at a time, thats very important. If you can put weight in it then it should be ok, but if the swelling doesn't go, go to the doctors. Its better to be safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  good luck<br>  <br>  xx
owjZhOOhaa	since you are still having these symptoms i would recommend that you go ahead and see a doctor.
AA12393936	You're not saying where you hurt.  It could be something as simple as constipation or as serious as cancer.  No way for anyone but a doctor to diagnose but if it's been three days and you're not even drinking much, you're becoming dehydrated and could end up in the ER.  Get to an urgent care clinic if you can.
5rsN7VsUaa	Thezzy,<br>  Thanks for your question. The symptoms of toxic mold exposure vary depending on the duration of exposure times. In the beginning, as the toxic mold spores are inhaled and introduced into the entire system of your body, organs, brain, blood etc you will notice respiratory distress (often misdiagnosed as asthma), headaches(debilitating at times), the onset of chronic fatigue, anxiety, confusion, inability to concentrate and flu like symptoms. The longer your exposed it can lead to severe brain damage similar to blunt force trauma to the head like in a car accident and death can occur. Toxic mold is SEVERELY toxic to humans and animals.

461411165b47f11271f6827674ccc7ddaa	it sounds as though it is being caused by anxiety to me - you should try lying down and doing relaxation exercises breathing slowly and deeply - this will slow your heart rate down to normal. it sounds as though you are getting hyped up and creating too much adrenaline in your system.<br>  If after relaxing and deep breathing for half an hour your heart is still beating abmormally you should see your doctor or got to A&E.
MyUi3Blyaa	Your mom is absolutely right.<br>  A breast cancer lump is obvious on inspection by your mom or a doctor.<br>  I don't blame you for being terrified but relax a bit.|`|AA11020187	If you asked your mother you are probably too young for breast cancer. Mention it the next time you go to the doctor and if the lumps grow in size let your mom know.|`|H4dswqRlaa	Some women have lots of harmless lumpy features. It probably only means that an actual cancer could hide among them longer than it should be allowed to get away with! One lump or two, different than everything else surrounding the area, should be checked right away. Further complicating the issue is that there is a wide blurry line between fast tumors and slow cancers. The thing any lady with cancer in her family history should do is to avoid common nasty poisons like the mercuric preservative in most water-based paint which takes months before it stops making people sick. And the known carcinogens in fresh tar fumes, as the tar causes cancer in white rats if you smear it on their backs where they can't lick it off. And of course, don't smoke, as the tar in the lungs is right up against the breast tissue. Regards, Larry.|`|yvQpQjv1aa	you just found it, so now is the best time to go to the doctor. no point stressing about it, hoping it will go away ,it may be nothing, but let a doctor determine that. not people on the internet. remember if it is cancer the sooner the doctors start to treat you the better, and if it is not then the sooner you can stop worrying about it! good luck.|`|QS9JDB6Yaa	who knows? you should go to a doctor and have a check up, just to make sure.

It is clear you do not have an STD or HPV if you have only ever had 1 sexual partner and he was tested. Your symptoms: Severe Acne, Cramps in my back and lower abdomen, Headaches,Upset Stomach,Weight Gain and Extreme Hunger and Thirst are all common of PMS and it is common for women's periods to change and become irregular, including bodily changes. PMS can cause weight gain, they change your eating habits and mood during your period and may encourage you to eat more. <br>  I had an extremely regular period, I knew what day it would be coming each month, did not have any pain etc, then all of a sudden one month I had really painful, heavy and irregular periods. But, 2 years later they settled down again and now, I am on BC so they come at a set time with little pain and extremely light. Have you discussed your periods, pain and perhaps getting on BC with your doctor.

AFi5kTiEaa	Well, riding a bike for about 2 miles cant take you to long, so i would suggest riding for longer.  I think i do 5 miles in under 20 minutes, its been a while.  Ride for 30 minutes and use the resistance on and off.  since you are going to be in boot camp (a KILLER) you need to start running.  you will HAVE to do it so you should start now.  You should do crunches..google different ab workouts there are alot of different ways to strenghten your abs.  Start with the girly pushups and work your way up to the "manly" ones.<br>  <br>  You mentioned the freshman 15, so if you are going away to college there will probably be a gym at the school.  you will be able to really start working out then using weights and different cardio machines.  that will really help you.  You can find things in your house to use as weights to strenghten your upper body.  gallon water jugs filled, hold on to the handles and do arm exercises.  soup cans,.<br>  <br>  You said you have no money, i totally get that BUT, if you have $10 a month you can come up with and have a planet fitness gym in your area it would be well worth it for you to join.<br>  <br>  good luck, start now and good luck with your future!!

AA10450066	Congratulations on not mixing. It sounds like an upper respiratory infection. Try a decongestant for the stuffy nose.That's the reason for the cough because the fluid is running down the back of your throat.If you want to take something for your pain do so.  If you start a temp then take some tylenol, and as you know the water is important too.If it doesn't break some by Monday call your doctor to see if you need antibiotics.You can also get a prescription cough med so you can sleep. If the cough doesn't stop try honey in some tea to soothe your throat.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	what are you talking about? what medicine? are you expecting someone here to prescribe a medicine for you.

aBZ6PIY9aa	about losing a tampon, that is impossible unless you have a deformation of the uterine and vaginal walls.  When you insert a tampon, your uterus is a muscular wall that will not let it go any further. This is also where your cervix is located. Your vagina is only a little bigger than the tampon you are inserting.  When a finger is inserted into your vagina, you can feel your cervix, feels like a little nub, and you can feel the wall of your uterus.  It is not just open to the contents of your abdomen.if it was everything would fall out of your vagina.|`|oonQOuPsaa	I TOTALLY agree with your tampon theory.

2Y9pejG6aa	It really depends on how bad you are ie what kind of level of care you require to ensure your safety.  I have been hospitalized twice.  Once was in a relatively low-maintenance type of place, a youth clinic where I had my own room and bathroom with a bed and table/chair, I got to have all my stuff including mobile phone/computer etc and I could come and go as long as I told staff when I would be returning.  The second time I overdosed and was really quite unstable, and still wanted to kill myself, so I was admitted to a more secure unit.  This time, they did take my things away including my phone, and the room was very small containing just a bed and nothing else.  Not a padded cell, but a sort of cell nonetheless (although you are not locked in or anything...you can go out and watch TV in a communal area).  The bathroom was shared and was a hole in the wall where water came out, a toilet and a small basin.  I had to ask before I was allowed to get my shampoo etc. and the nurses had to get drinks of water for you etc.  The thing in common between the two places was that you get checked every 15 minutes by nurses, even when sleeping so there isn't much privacy.  It really was not a lot of fun.  But those types of places are really just for crisis control and you tend to not have to stay there very long.  I was assessed by a psych team for two days and then discharged, and referred to outpatient care.  Hope this is helpful for you :)|`|0BdTKNZzaa	The staff are really mean and only let you watch the test pattern on the TV.
Cfe7NoTdaa	Here's the thing, If you do these two exercises all the time you'll get what's called muscle memory. You may not gain a lot of size or definition (you almost certainly will gain some) but you may come out of it being able to do 300 push-ups and sit ups instead, which is a pretty good result. I'd recommend mixing it up by doing different kinds of push-ups, pull ups, sit ups, and then some crunches (lifting your neck and shoulders barely off the floor while in the sit-up position) and then doing lots of stretches for your upper body...that will definitely give you a lot more definition. Stretch every morning and every night on top of your routine and I can almost guarantee you'll up your tone/definition results by 50% at minimum.|`|kf26i7J1aa	hey well im a girl so our bodies are different but i eat junk food a lot with some healthy snacks in between and i only way 68 pounds.

DBUmR8FTaa	The Psychiatrist will put you at ease and make you feel comfortable. You will be nervous at first but they have a way of getting you to talk and feel good about yourself. It is like having a best friend that you can talk to and knowing they will help you. You do not have to let anyone know that you went to a Psychiatrist. It is not their business. Don't worry about future employers they can not ask and it is not on the application form.It is nothing to be ashamed of. It is good that you are getting help.You will not be locked up. you will get the help you need they will find out why you are derpessed it could be something as simple as medicine.You will be ok don't worry|`|AA11610448	probably the first thing s/he will do is to take a look at your medications and run lab tests and just talk to you a bit to see how treatment and things are going for you.|`|e72ee774f8daf9ca729e809880c5d0f6aa	Psychiatrists are humans. There are good ones and there are bad ones. Choose wisely. Do referrals and reference checks. Fortunately we are living in a better informed world. Anyone, including future employers are more understanding of what you can offer rather than the rough patches which everyone goes through sometime in their lives. If they don't, just move on. They are not worth bothering with or wasting your time on! Kind Regards and Good luck with your life.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	Just answer his/her questions honestly. They're not out to eat you, or lock you up. Just be honest and you'll be fine.  And No, future employers are not going to find out about your sessions. There are laws that protect your doctor/patient relationship, and psychiatrists are bound by the same laws.<br>     Don't be afraid. The psychiatrist is there to help you - not lock you up. He/she will understand if you have openness issues; there's lots of people that do. Just because you're shy at first does not mean they're going to lock you up.

But she could be having absence seizures, which is like people just go out of it for a while, they don't know it's happening, it's like they snap into this trance (it's cuz their brain is firing really randomly, it just sort of puts the body into zombie mode) and then they come out if it in a few minutes or seconds, they don't even know it happened.  She might just be daydreaming, I have ADD/ADHD, I daydream a lot and I will be thinking about something then look up and realize I just heard somebody talking but I wasn't listening at all and I have to get them to repeat it.  as for the attitude thing...totally normal, totally normal.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is a potentially faital illness that can affect anyone but most common in menstruating young women using tampons, it's caused when the common bacteria staphylococcus aureus start to produce TSS-toxin1 that gets into your bloodstream and attacks your body. <br>  <br>  Initial symptoms are fever, sore throat, headache, aching, vomiting, diarrhea, red eyes, skin flaking around hands and feet and low blood pressure. Symptoms begin after your period starts, and you may not get all symptoms, but if you suspect TSS remove the tampon saving it then go to hospital telling them you suspect TSS, even if you have doubts quick action may save your life. The serious phase lasts 4-5 days and it can kill within a week, survivers are left with serious life-long health problems. <br>  <br>  TSS is linked to tampons due to synthetics used in the 80's that weren't safety tested, many women died but manufacturers ignored the problem, continuing to promote the tampons until they were banned years later. Since then other harmful ingredients have been used, but as manufacturers are self-regulated and there are no independent safety tests so little is done. Even without harmful ingredients TSS is still a risk along with many other health problems due to vaginal damage caused by tampon use, manufacturers legally have to warn about TSS but not about other risks. TSS is rare but statistics only count 1/3 of all cases so unfortanatly people don't take it seriously and so there's a lot of missinformation – for example people say you can only get TSS from leaving a tampon in too long, which is simply untrue as TSS is always a risk with tampon use. <br>  <br>  TSS is totally avoidable by using pads or cups instead of tampons, or at least using organic tampons which are free from synthetics and chemicals that increase the risks. For each 1g increase in absorbency TSS risk increases by 37% use the lowest possible absorbancy, changing absorbency as flow changes. Never use tampons when not menstruating, during light flow or while sleeping as there's no flow so tampons absorb more vaginal fluids causing vaginal damage. Using tampons all the time increases TSS risk by a factor of 33 so switch between tampons and pads. Change every 4-6 hours, TSS is always a risk but the longer you leave a tampon the longer bacteria have to multiply. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toxicshock.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.toxicshock.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.spotsite.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.spotsite.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.tamponalert.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.tamponalert.org.uk</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.frontiernet.net/%7Eruthb/Tampons.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.frontiernet.net/%7Eruthb/Tamp...</a>|`|955YoHvVaa	Tss stands for Toxic Shock Syndrome..basically its associated with tampon use..|`|oonQOuPsaa	Toxic Shock Syndrome.<br>  This is when a tampon has been in for too long. the blood gets clogged and...yeah.

She needs to see a dr right away to get her bipolar under control.|`|mAp90hEeaa	She will not die from this.  These statements are her mental illness talking and she believes this to be true although she has no basis for her statements.  It sounds like her illness is not under very good control because many people who are bipolar can lead somewhat normal lives when they take their medications every single day without ever missing any doses.  You might give a call to her doctor since you are the one living with her and relay to her doctor's nurse her behavior and her statements and then convince her she needs a check-up so her doctor can adjust her medications.  Then, once they start working, you might have a quieter time in your household.  Her doctor/psychiatrist is the only ones who can make this better for you.  Get her an appointment with whoever manages her bipolar meds.  Sounds like she is way overdue for a check-up.|`|AiLpsPWHaa	I don't really know anything about it but read some information on here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bipolar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bipolar.com/</a>|`|kXGpShxraa	tl;dr sorry. :/ but uh, what i got was i think she's having a stroke.

Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance to get rid of that belly fat (which I’m sure isn't that bad anyway hun!! :)<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious! (Veggie section even though it’s a bean loll)<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get. BUT make sure you get the 100% whole wheat ones ya know?-just to be the healthiest. There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!?

iPsFTNivaa	First off, if your bite plane (that is the proper term for it) is removable, then by all means, remove it when you eat.  If you don't, you could break it while eating.  And, yes, your back teeth will continue to erupt until they touch so it is very important that you wear your bite plane all the time (except while eating and brushing).  Everytime you remove it for any length of time you will undo the progress you've made by wearing it.
Bs4BBJSPaa	put gauze on it and put pressure on it if the blood soaks through put more on top of the old gauze if it doesn't stop in 3 days then i would take him to the er weather he wanted to go or not he is just scared to get stitches witch i would be to.  tell him not to bend it even if the cut is not at a joint when he moves it the body sends more blood to the finger witch causes it to bleed more if you do take him to the er tell him that every thing will be fine and that every one gets hurt and needs stitches some time.|`|gVejeg9maa	Ok first I don't know where people get the idea of what stitches are for or why they need them.  But sutures(stitches) serve two basic functions: 1) stop bleeding 2) help prevent infection.  It doesn't have anything to do with how deep it is or how bad it looks. Period.  If the bleeding hasn't stopped go get the sutures.|`|2MtDp74raa	well.....sounds like its not a small cut. well...if he loses enough blood....he could bleed out. then he'll pass out....and you'll have about 2 minutes to get him to the ER before some permanent damage is done.<br>  <br>  if it IS a small cut...then he could have leukemia. get his *** to the ER, or call an ambulance/the cops if he wont go.|`|AA10604086	Get to the ER.

Get going now!|`|DoHaUEziaa	Well, it's very possible he damaged tendons, ligaments and/or nerves. With it still bleeding, it sounds like it's not healing properly and may require stitches. He would be feeling faint if he lost that much blood. He should go to the ER just to be sure.
fk9AvB25aa	HSV1 can not turn into HSV2. They are slightly different strains of herpes which don't turn into each other. Cold sores are very contagious and can be passed to the genitals at almost any time, but there would be more of a chance of contracting them while there is an out break.<br>  You can get HSV1 genitally, it's usually passed on when some one with an out break of cold sores gives you oral sex. HSV1 and 2 can have similar if not the same symptoms. You could have the same symptoms that you get with genital herpes, when you get an out break of HSV1 orally. <br>  With genital herpes there could be blisters that burst then form open sores and scab up or there could e cut like lesions appearing on the genitals. <br>  HSV1 usually likes to live on the mouth and HSV2 usually likes to live on the genitals but HSV1 can be passed to the genitals and HSV2 can be passed to the mouth. Their preference in location is mainly the difference.<br>  I have HSV1 orally and genitally and HSV2 on my genitals.|`|dtzlrB9Faa	Oral HSV-1 can become HSV1-genitally.  Since this is not the site of preference for HSV1 the outbreaks should be less frequent than if you had them orally.  Many only have 1 outbreak if they get HSV1 genitally. <br>  <br>  Genital herpes typically refers to anything below the belt and can be HSV1-or HSV2.  HSV1 never becomes HSV2.|`|Bldp1kAdaa	hsv 1- 40% of people get one outbreak and then never again<br>            50% get 2 outbreaks then never again, and then the last 10%  <br>            get chronic outbreaks<br>  <br>  hsv 2- Some never get any symptoms, but most will get 3-6   <br>             outbreaks a year while on some kind of medication<br>  <br>  hsv 1 is hard to spread genital-genital, herpes researchers have never even seen a case. but i actually spread it to my boyfriend who already has cold sores because it was during my initial outbreak! so never say never.

5PIgZ7tFaa	Medications don't work all that well for BPD. They just mask the symptoms, and don't really fix the problem. BPD is a personality disorder; not an organic problem like bipolar or schizophrenia.<br>      There is an effective treatment called Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Google it.<br>       While medications might help your symptoms temporarily, they won't fix the underlying causes of the disorder. That takes time, and a willingness to change one's whole way of thinking. That takes therapy, and a lot of hard work.<br>       A borderline has been trained to act the way they do, and it takes a lot of effort to UNTRAIN themselves. Medications are a band-aid solution to a deep, complex problem.|`|q0HVCvqMaa	I disagree with cultural vandal. My doctor was very emphatic when she told my spouse and I that BPD is partly  'organic' (i.e. brain chemistry) and behavioral and that a combination of medications and talk therapy is the best way to go. As the others have said, see a doctor and get professional help. You may have to see more than one doctor and try more than one medication as everyone reacts differently to meds.|`|28RK2hKBaa	Every person's brain is wired differently and what works for one person might not work for another. I have heard that mood stabilizers and anti-depressants together with DBT therapy work best. But again, I think it varies per person. good luck!|`|xwfdn6Xkaa	Speak to your doctor, and don't be doing your own treatment.|`|AA11610448	usually, it's hit or miss until they find the right drug or combo.  i take zoloft and wellbutrin, they seem to work well for me, but i've been on lots in the past.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	I'm with Margarita. Your psychiatrist will evaluate you and determine which medications are best. This will most likely be an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic depending on how severe your symptoms are.
5b5d4988ba65f4dbcc18b4ea2051bf82aa	I suppose the stethoscope phobia could be from anything, how old are you? could it be an age thing? <br>  The way to look at it is it's nothing embarrassing to have a nursse or doctor listen to your heart with a stethoscope, everyone has had it done sometimes even the nurse or doctor listening to you, it sure beats them having to put their ear to your chest to listen!|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	about your possible heart condition....get checked by your dr|`|2MtDp74raa	sounds like your phobia of stethoscopes is not your biggest problem right now. talk to your doctor ASAP about your heart problems, because this is NOT normal and could be signs of a serious and growing problem.<br>  <br>  get over your phobia of stethoscopes. just close your eves and think of something else.|`|eMXIQaQlaa	If you feel like your heart is having a problem then it would probably be in your best interest to see a doctor. Don't let your phobia stop you.  <br>  <br>  Your phobia probably has something to do with a past experience or something that you associate with that object. But in reality, whatever happened was probably a long time ago and probably wasn't actually that bad. If it happened when you were a kid, you might not remember, but a child's mind can turn just really normal things like a doctor listening to your heart into something entirely different. <br>  <br>  Just look at the stethoscope like you would any other object, like a spoon or a pen or something. Pretend it's something else. Give it a funny name if that helps you. Turn whatever about it scares you into something funny. You will probably eventually just grow out of it.
MSLYlm8Laa	i have the same problem. my strategy is to think about the root of your fears, and prove them irrational. for example, if you think you are having a heart attack, think about this:<br>  <br>  *the drug shrinks blood vessels, making the heart work harder.<br>  *that is why i can hear  it beating so loud.<br>  <br>  next, take steps to calm down, and focus on those.<br>  <br>  *breathe in, out, in, out <br>  * im okay, it's just my brain playing tricks on me. its the chemicals screwing with me, im NOT dying.<br>  <br>  Finally, try to enjoy the high. think about all the good things you have coming (summer vacation, seeing freinds, going on a roller coaster). try to relate the high to really good things. Eventually, you will shape it into any euphoric feeling you want like falling or going fast, or eating something really good or even orgasm. then, every time you get high, you will love it.|`|AA11610448	panic attacks are a common side effect of marijuana (thc.)|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Oddly enough there is an underlying reason for your attacks not just your smoking and drinking. You are afraid of something, someone finding something out, a fear of death, financial trouble, being alone or chaos at work. One thing you need to do is take some deep breaths in and out, for some people breathing into a paper bag works. See a counselor she can help you get to the root of your attacks if you don't know yourself. I myself used to have these same kind of attacks I never used drugs but the temptation was always there from other people I knew. Taking a few deep breaths every day any time you feel like you are going to have an attack just close your eyes and take some deep breaths. These attacks are caused by irregular breathing once you get your breathing under control over time the anxiety attacks will cease to exist. I found out my attacks were related to a general fear because I would start to have an attack anytime I talked about my fears to anyone. After I conquered my own attacks I helped a friend of mine conquer his through many conversations and prayer. He wanted to give up so easy thinking he would never get past his attacks after having them for several years but he did. Don't ever give up on yourself if you want to get past it and beat it because it will eventually control you. You have to control it before it controls you! Drugs Drinking and panic attacks are the devils way of getting us under his control and the fear is not of him.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Drinking beer and using recreational drugs is called self-medicating. It's bad. You should see a mental health professional to find the root of the problem.<br>  <br>  If you start having a panic attack you need to ground yourself by focusing on an object that is close by that you can hold in your hand. Focus on every physical aspect of that object and block everything else out. <br>  <br>  Taking deep breaths - which feels impossible - with a paper bag will also help regulate your breathing, which can prevent an attack from happening, or make it less severe.|`|xuZ656VVaa	my brother has anxiety/panic attacks, and i hate to see him like that. if your comfortable with expressing our feelings to someone you just meet, you can go to see a consuler, that has been really helping my brother. anxiety/panic attacks can lead to depressian of they are that bad, so if they are, you can take anti-depressesions(or however you spell it). but dont take them just to take them. i hope i helped, and i hope it gets better.|`|8RqmZ3zpaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZEH4E6BY..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZEH4E6BY...</a><br>  <br>  I found this youtube video quite some time ago when I was battling with my Panic Disorder.

78a5a61da0c084ee17a4bd8a260bb037aa	Eating healthy and exercise are the best natural ways to lose weight.  Avoid fast foods, white flour, processed foods, hydrogenated oils, sugar and corn syrup.  Drink lots of water.  Low fat dairy products are very good and some studies have indicated that the calcium in them helps with weight loss.  Also, eating lots of fresh fruits and vegetables (watch the fatty dressings), lean proteins such as eggs and lean meat, beans which are high in vegetable protein and fiber and fiber-rich whole grains will help a lot.  Drink water instead of soda.  Oh, and I will give you a link to my favorite website.  This gal is amazing at giving tips on making junk food healthy.  Yes, soccer and the trampoline are very good activities.  Walking is also good and it's free.|`|kf26i7J1aa	I do not weight much, and I keep it that way by playing sports. I used to play soccer, so that's a good sport, and trampolines will help a little if you jump on it enough. I also play basketball, and running hard really keeps me thin. Also, check your diet. Don't randomly decide you're hungry and then eat cookies. Either ignore that feeling until the next mealtime, or eat something healthy/healthyish for a snack. (Granola bar, apple, orange, carrots, yogurt. . .) If you have friends that live in your neighborhood, walk to their house or walk them home if they come over to your house.|`|DZvhiX8Raa	well im sure theres a way to, but i would recommend that you dont eat after 7 and dont eat a lot af junk food you will probably lose it in like idk a few weeks maybe
57j6hSjNaa	The cheapest way for teeth whitening is brushing with baking soda couple times a week and rinsing with peroxide everyday.. The baking soda cleans the stains off the enamel, because the invasive particles are going to polish the yellow layer off your teeth. Try it for six weeks and use straws when drinking caffinated beverages. You will see a improvement in your smile. <br>  <br>  ***Note: [Do not use the baking soda more that twice a week, because it will wear the enamel.]<br>  <br>  Or if you don't mind paying for a dental office visit, try the zoom whitening. It whitens up to 10 shades brighter in an hour.. Also, a cheaper route at the dental office is a bleaching tray. You will get a personalized bleaching tray and use it a home for about a week. The dental office bleach has a higher concentration of bleach than store bleaching products. <br>  <br>  Good luck !!|`|IXLrUEWdaa	If you can't do office bleaching do crest white stripes they work very well.

AA11292270	I completely agree with you.  I went to those meetings for nine years.  A waste of life indeed.  The "disease theory" is just a way of setting up the medical care system so that "rehab centers" get paid for doing faith healing (AA is nothing more than faith healing, and 95% of treatment centers are based on it).  As far as never being healed, all I can say is, I've been continuously abstinent from alcohol for over ten years.  There is no struggle with staying sober.  I don't call myself an alcoholic nor to I consider myself "recovering" for life.|`|AA10450066	No, it's not a waste for the people that live with these diseased yes I said diseased people. This woman is showing great pride in her situation and dealing with it like any mature person would. If you've been able to live so far without having to ever confide in anyone for anything then good for you, but eventually you're going to want someone to talk to to keep your sanity. The way you decide to do this is your decision, but don't put people down that take these meetings seriously and use it to get through life.|`|cWBFNoWMaa	An alcoholic is always an alcoholic.  They are never a cured alcoholic but a recovering alcoholic.  Most go to meetings all of their lives.  Some go to meetings every day.  What would be a waste of life would be for them to continue drinking.  an alcoholic cannot control their drinking.  One drink leads to 100.  Better to spend an hour a day at a meeting than the rest of your life drunk.  Go to the AA website to learn more about AA and how and why it works.  I think you will change your mind about wasting time.  No, I am not an alcoholic but am familiar with the program and know it works|`|XSNdj7Meaa	I think each person finds ways to cope with being an alcoholic or dealing with an alcoholic. While I would not go to AA meetings, maybe for her it worked.
gSo4dR7oaa	Yes, it is possible.  Age doesn't matter.  What matters is the amount and frequency of drinking over a long period of time.  Also, people's bodies react in different ways.  Some people wind up with liver damage sooner than others.<br>  <br>  Drinking alcohol is VERY  HARD on the liver.  Your doctor's preliminary diagnosis does not surprise me at all, given your history.  However, you always have a right to get a second opinion.<br>  <br>  You say you've "only been drinking daily for about 6 years."  That is a long time, especially since you actually started before that (even though you stopped for awhile.)  <br>  <br>  You also say that you never considered yourself an alcoholic.  Daily drinking for that period of time is an indication of alcoholism.<br>  <br>  Please follow through with testing so you can get an accurate diagnosis, and referral to a specialist if you do have liver disease from drinking. I suggest that you also get professional help to quit drinking.  Continuing to drink will do more damage to your liver, cause more problems, and could kill you. Please get some help. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10450066	Join the club.I also have a cirrhotic liver, but not due to drinking.It was because in the 1980's I had a blood transfusion and got hepatitis C.

You're still young without any other health problems.Stop drinking and take the treatment for it. I can't anymore because I'm not healthy enough otherwise and it takes 6 months but it'll give you more years of life.Good luck and hope this helps.You're not alone.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	You say that you were drinking everyday, but how much were you drinking?  Anything more than 1 glass of wine each day is unhealthy.  You don't have to be an alcoholic to damage your liver.  And it is possible that you had a weak liver to begin with.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	The blood tests will tell you.  I don't think the crowd at Answers can tell you much.  Good luck.|`|W4whHKmxaa	Yes, it is possible.  Some people are more<br>  sensitive to alcohol than others are.  Some<br>  people can drink all their lives and never have<br>  any problems at all...others are not that<br>  fortunate.  For those who have a sensitivity<br>  to alcohol, it doesn't take much to cause a <br>  problem with the liver.  <br>  <br>  Let me fill you in to what may occur now.<br>  You will be told to stop drinking, any drinking<br>  now may cause more liver damage.  You will<br>  also be asked what medications you are taking:<br>  be sure to tell the doctor all over the counter,<br>  herbs, herbal teas, vitamins, minerals, and<br>  drugs prescribed by other doctors.  <br>  <br>  The doctors do blood testing to see how the<br>  liver is doing:<br>  (1) The liver enzyme levels will tell them if<br>  there is damage to the liver cells<br>  (2) The liver function tests will tell them how<br>  well the cells of the liver are functioning to do<br>  the job of keeping the body healthy<br>  (3) The viral testing to be sure this problem<br>  isn't caused by something else like a <br>  Hepatitis virus known as Hep A,B,C, etc.<br>  <br>  By these blood tests, the doctor has a hint of<br>  something being wrong.  It takes further testing<br>  to see more, such as an Ultrasound, CT scan,<br>  or MRI.  None of these cause any pain.<br>  <br>  The doctor may examine your abdomen in<br>  the upper right hand quadrant, just under the ribs.<br>  He is trying to feel if the liver is enlarged <br>  in size.  Let me explain what happens:<br>  If the liver cells become damaged, the <br>  immune system of the body responds to this<br>  and causes inflammation to develop in the<br>  liver.  This inflammation will cause the liver<br>  to enlarge in size.  If the alcohol consumption<br>  is stopped and the inflammation that has<br>  developed because of its effect on the cells...<br>  the liver cells may heal and the condition <br>  can be reversed.  <br>  <br>  An Ultrasound film being done will show<br>  the inflammation, how well the blood is flowing<br>  through the liver, if there are any growths in<br>  the liver and will help the doctor diagnose<br>  you and provide treatment.<br>  <br>  The doctor can give you medication to help<br>  you stop the alcohol and to help relieve the<br>  symptoms that occur by stopping.  You could<br>  be with a support group known as AA to do<br>  this or you can also try a detox program at<br>  a hospital.  There is help. <br>  <br>  Be very careful taking any over the counter<br>  pain medications.  Taking Tylenol with<br>  alcohol can cause immediate cell damage to<br>  the liver and there are other medications when<br>  taken with it can have this same effect. <br>  It is best not to take any medications that<br>  are not prescribed or approved of by your<br>  doctors.  The reason for this, is because<br>  most all medications go through the liver<br>  first to be broken down before going to the<br>  rest of the body...and some are alot harder<br>  on the liver than others are. <br>  <br>  You need to stay as healthy as you can right now.<br>  Try to wash hands often: wash any fruits or<br>  vegetables from the grocery store that other<br>  have handled; wipe off shopping cart handles<br>  with germ killing wipes like wet ones; carry<br>  purell or something to put on your hands to<br>  disinfect them when touching things other<br>  has touched; stay away from eatting at<br>  open salad bars where people sneeze or<br>  put their hands into it.  You don't want to<br>  place yourself in a position now of getting<br>  ill some other way as it will delay the healing<br>  of your liver and also force you to take even<br>  more medications. <br>  <br>  The best doctor to be with right now, if<br>  you do find out you have a liver problem...<br>  and also for those other conditions, is a<br>  gastroenterologist (deals with the whole <br>  digestive system) or a hepatologist<br>  (specialist in the liver).  <br>  <br>  A test that the doctor will do, usually as a last<br>  resort...because it is invasive...is the liver<br>  biopsy.  It is the best test now available to<br>  determine how far along a person is in the<br>  disease of the liver and also how much damage<br>  may be done. <br>  <br>  It is terrible waiting for the results of testing.<br>  It would be wonderful to know that this was<br>  caught early on and that, by stopping drinking,<br>  it could be cured.  <br>  <br>  If this is inflammation and the drinking is not<br>  stopped...it can lead to a disease known as<br>  cirrhosis of the liver...where the liver cells<br>  die off and it will keep progressing...there is<br>  no known cure once it reaches that stage.<br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/art...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cirrhosis/DS00373" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cirrhos...</a><br>  <br>  I would like to give you a link to explain what<br>  alcohol does to the body of someone who<br>  is sensitive to it.

Unfortunately, it is possible for you to have damaged your liver.  You seem awful young but everyone is affected differently and what damages you may not damage someone else for a longer period of time.  My grandmother smoked her whole life, quit when she was 85 and died at 96 of old age with perfectly clean lungs.  I have a relative who smoked a much shorter period of time, is much younger and is dying of emphysema.  It just depends on your body.  I myself am allergic to alcohol.  I can barely tolerate the sugar alcohols they use in sugar-free candy.  I hope things turn out well for you.  Perhaps now is a good time to think about quitting and doing things that are healthier and better for yourself.  Don't you deserve to be healthy and well.  If you have been drinking daily for 6 years it might be a good idea for you to visit an AA meeting because it sounds to me like you do have a problem but are in denial about it.  Whatever happens, good luck and I wish you the best.|`|a5SIZIOZaa	Look, you know how people say everyone is different? Well that's true about body organs... It's like having a man drink and smoke for his whole life and live till he's 102, and then have a man live and not mess with any of it... and die at 50... it depend on the person.<br>  In the short it is possible and if your doctor said it, it might be true... I can suggest getting a second opinion... if it's true... lay off the alcohol... it isn't great for your body anyways... Of course I speak as a person who has NEVER drunk or smoked... it messes with 20 something organs... All you can do from here is do better :)<br>  good luck|`|ciXSjbCiaa	Yes, that is absolutely possible. You have been drinking a lot. Some studies show that 3-4 drinks a week is at a toxic level for some women. If you have been drinking everyday for the past six years, that is an enormous amount. The best thing to do, the best treatment for your condition is to stop drinking cold. Really, the liver can heal itself pretty well if you just stop drinking all together. If you don't, you could end up with liver cirrhosis and that is not something you ever want to deal with. If you are relying on alcohol for personal issues, maybe seek therapy so that you don't go back to using it as a protective mechanism.|`|rRIiY6Itaa	When I drank soda daily everyday it had a massive impact on my physical being. My bones felt weak and were sensitive along with my teeth hurting with little nutrients to my dry skin. It can have an effect.<br>  <br>  Alcohol has the ability to go threw the aligning of your liver over time. If you were going to to drink everyday at a certain time. Your system isnt going to clear the alcohol from your liver in 24 hours. It just takes a cup(key word) of alcohol a day for a few years to have an effect. Logically, I can see how it can effect someone. Its like saying a apple a day keeps the doctor away.<br>  <br>  So yes, it is possible. Though, there should be some other sort of testing because you could have a crooked doctor.|`|bCmqScVlaa	Yes, it is possible to have liver damage if you have been drinking since 98 even if you had a break.  This is your wake up call from your doctor.  Ask for a copy of your lab results.  Most likely your liver enzymes AST/ALT are going to be elevated whether or not there is permanent damage to your liver.  Drinking will irritate the liver and cause them to rise.  You will want to look at the results of your biliruben, INR, and especially platelets to find out if liver damage is more serious.  That could mean you have cirrhosis which is permanent scarring of the liver.  I'm sure your doctor will explain the results to you.  <br>  <br>  You must stop drinking forever because anyone that starts drinking at noon and does it daily is an alcoholic.  But you are right in taking steps to do it safely.  Ask your doctor, or AA could also tell you what you need to do.  You are not able to take just a drink or two and quit.  Even if you do have the early stages of cirrhosis, you can still get well and stay healthy as long as you don't do any further damage to your liver by continued drinking.  It's only in the later stages of cirrhosis that can be fatal unless one gets a transplant.  <br>  <br>  I'm really glad that you are scared.  I hope that fear is strong enough to make you stop destroying your body with drinking.  You're very young and hardly have had a chance to really live your life yet.  You have to find a way to live your life sober to keep your health.  I wish you the best.
m3Vf6nbeaa	i know how u feel. i did alomst the exact same thing in october except on my dresser. i went to the doctor and got it xrayed and it was a waste of money. they couldnt do anything since its the little toe and my toe was black and purple then green and yelow|`|qImMwhUHaa	If the pain and swelling is located to the toe only and not the foot, from my experience, they can't really do anything. They tape the toe to the toe next to it to help it heal. If you have insurance, I would go ahead to the ER. If not then wait it out for a few days but if your foot is involved at all you may need x-rays to determine if you have a broken bone in your foot.|`|gVejeg9maa	Prop you foot up and put an ice pack on it.  There is nothing they can do for a broken toe.|`|azxbIaVfaa	go to the doctor!|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	yup sounds broken.<br>  <br>  I'd get it xrayed|`|pGBTHEjtaa	Go to the hospital get it checked out.

YXpmzeVqaa	Please stay away from Chantix!!!!! I went through a bad relationship, got out and got myself on track and was feeling awesome about the future. Decided to stop smoking and went on chantix....One month later I tried to commit suicide, was horribly depressed, moody, irritable the whole nine yards. Not to mention the horrible horrible nightmares that I had.....I think chantix is BAD news!!!|`|ivhnVbbraa	I took chantix and I just felt a little sick to my stomach and had vivid dreams. Not scary ones and it did help me to quit smoking. But I have had friends that is gave really bad cramps and bloating. Another had nightmares that made him paranoid and he would get up and stand in his kids room to make sure she was ok. But none of that happened to me. So it's a chance you would have to take if you wanted to. There is the patch (gave me a rash) and gum (did not help me at all) or cold turkey if you think you can manage. That's how my fiance quit!|`|4cfX7AThaa	Look, my grandfather smoked till the day he died at 90....if your feeling good, don't try to look to find ways to bring yourself down!

Varenicline is in a class of medications called smoking cessation aids. It works by blocking the pleasant effects of nicotine (from smoking) on the brain.<br>  Nausea occurs commonly in people taking varenicline. Other less common side effects include headache, difficulty sleeping, and abnormal dreams. Rare side effects reported by people taking varenicline compared to placebo include change in taste, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, and constipation. In May 2008, Pfizer updated the safety information associated with Chantix, noting that "some patients have reported changes in behavior, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thoughts or actions."<br>  Please see the web pages for more details on Varenicline (generic name) Chantix (brand name).|`|sw2R5A9iaa	the worst is nausea and it only happens when the patient smokes!!  otherwise, speak to your doctor.
Vj13f7zmaa	Possibly a mild case.  If you had it full out you would be vomiting and diarrhea all at the same time and would feel as if you were dying.  I know.. I had it twice.  But you probably have a mild case of it or of one of the other food bacterias.  There is nothing really to do but wait it out.  Good thing if it is salmonella it will run its course in 24 hrs or so.  If you aren't vomiting then you will probably be just fine.|`|pha427Puaa	Possibly. Make sure you stay hydrated. Infection occurs 8-72 hours after ingestion of infected food or water. Symptoms can last ~5days. Usually self limiting. See a doctor if you get dehydrated, have blood in stool and fever.|`|4PLC1aEJaa	go to the hospital|`|01Mu3wUeaa	What color is the feces?<br>  <br>  Are you experiencing bad stomach cramps or just a stomach ache?<br>  <br>  Doesn't really sound like salmonella to be honest.<br>  <br>  Sounds more like Noro virus.<br>  <br>  Don't waste your time or money at the hospital/doctor unless your illness persists for more than 3 days.<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep hydrated and rest in bed.If it is noro, you should feel better within 24 hours or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  Prevention:<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|emkT1a6raa	could be. go to a doctor/hospital

LP1vTJCFaa	I have also had problems like this and also deal with anxiety issues. I believe that the feelings that I have towards my parents health is simply an anxiety issue on my part. The best advice that I can give is to work through it and work yourself into knowing that its nothing that you can change, so its only going to hurt yourself to continue worrying. The thoughts of dying or others dying is a hallmark of anxiety and panic attacks. You are correct, I am a little younger than you and have parents in their 60s. My anxiety took over my life for at least a year before I worked it out myself. I felt drugged under all of the medicines and just stopped them all and worked through it with the help of family and friends. I completely understand the having problems with life changing, but my best advice is that you just have to accept it and beat the anxiety or it will continue to rule over you.|`|TrTfowAQaa	my doc said "the fear of having the people that are close to you dyin is a normal side effect to growing up in an unstable household " my dad drinks A LOT and always has... i'm very close to my mom and i've never had anyone close to me die...I feel your pain i'm not sure how I did it but I've resolved it inside myself.

A circle has no beginning and no ending. Day follows night, Summer follows winter. Birth follows Death. Each spin of the circle brings new growth and new life. If we think in terms of what she has done for you and then in terms of what you can do for her and then your own progenies etc life becomes less morbid, less inward looking and more towards regrowth and the dawn rather than the dusk. The "marks" you leave for your fellow travellers determines how happy you will be and how happy, others blessed with your company will be. That includes your mum! Good luck and God Bless.|`|vAAGriFkaa	It's normal to be afraid of death - most of the people at some point in their lives go through that crisis. In your case, it sounds a bit more serious because you are very close to your mother and it seems you might be obsessed with it.<br>  If you have been thinking about this issue for a long time (more than a month or so) than maybe you should see a shrink or at least talk to someone close to you (not your mother) about it.<br>  Try see things in a rational way and enjoy your life.

See a Dr for an evaluation and maybe meds and suggest cognitive behavioral therapy with your Dr. HUGS!!|`|AA11820571	I think you need to understand where this fear started and why. Also, understand that life is all about life and death, nobody lives forever and you will survive her death. It sound like you may need to learn some good coping skills.

AA11352641	Extremely well conditioned athletes have a slower heart rate because their heart muscle pumps so efficiently that is doesn't need to pump fast. Unless you plan on being a serious triathlete or runner, don't count on this happening. <br>  <br>  Regular heart rate is 60-90. Below 60 is too low and above 120 is considered tachycardic (too fast). Everyone's body is different though. My resting rate is usually around 90. Women typically have higher rates than men because they are smaller and have less blood volume. There are many factors within your heart electrically that exercise will not change, but meds will. Any doctor will tell you the best way to avoid heart disease and diabetes is thru good diet and exercise, not a slow heart rate.|`|AA12198082	heart rate in normal conditions can be lowered with exercise. <br>  The healthier your heart and body the more efficient your heart is and therefore has to work less to produce the same effect.<br>  <br>  This is why endurance athletes have great heart rates.<br>  <br>  I would recommend cycling or running. Even if it only helps a little it can only help.|`|t81MEJ82aa	You don't have to run a marathon to have a lower heart rate. Runners and cyclists have lower heart rates because they do cardiovascular workouts more often. Doing cardio is their profession.<br>  <br>  Yes, your resting heart rate can be lowered by doing cardio consistently. Aim for 3 times a week for at least 30 minutes. Also, I didn't see anything about your diet. Having a healthy diet can only help.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you are young, which would explain your doctors in the past have never said anything. Not that it doesn't matter at a young age, but the effects are pronounced in people middle aged and beyond.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	It'd be interesting to see the information you've been reading.  Regards high heart rates, odd as it may sound but most overweight people don't have slow metabolisms, quite the reverse, so I wonder if there is a degree of "chicken and egg" about the information.<br>  <br>  Okay, so can exercise decrease your resting heart rate, simple answer yes it can.  You can also take up things like Yoga which with practice you can use to drop your heart rate to quite low levels.  Yoga can even help you relax when you have interviews or appointments with the doctor, so those measurements you gave would have been lowered.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you exercise you are less likely to suffer diabetes or cancer anyway!<br>  <br>  ---<br>  I sound sooo new age...

aBZ6PIY9aa	you take 21 "active" pills and during the placebos you should start your period. usually around the 3-5 placebo pill. your period may still be the same length as normal or it may be shorter.  and it is not necessarily considered a week early, on the 3rd placebo it would be cycle day 24, on placebo day 5 it would be cycle day 26.  So everyones cycle is different lengths usually between 26-30 days from start of one period to start of next period|`|5wDSSzaVaa	You should have three weeks worth of pills with hormones. The last week, in your case I'm guessing the green ones, are your placebos. You can take them or not, but either way, that's the week you should have your period. You won't skip your period unless you skip the week of green ones and start taking the white ones immediately.<br>  <br>  You should have a period every four weeks, hence the three weeks of white pills and the "fourth" week when you have green pills is when you start your period.<br>  <br>  If you have spotting in between or you don't have a period during your placebos, check with your doctor. You might have the wrong balance of hormones for your system. It doesn't necessarily mean you're pregnant unless you're having unprotected sex while starting brith control.|`|1OA8ZegTaa	You should get your period sometime during the placebo week.

Younger than that the baby usually can't survive on it's own. At 24 weeks they need a lot of care, breathing aparatus and so on, and most don't survive, so it's considered legal up to that point.<br>  <br>  There are different methods too. Up to 6 weeks they can give pills to  induce a miscarriage.

3c7af99d45cd29de4b5830261c158f92aa	The ammonia contribute to the release and absorption of the nicotine making the cigarette more addictive. Other chemicals are added to enhance flavor and reduce some compounds that make the smoke too harsh.<br>  There's no real need to improve the taste of tobacco. I used to smoke real tobacco (no treatment) in cigarettes made with corn skins (chalas). The taste is great (at least I liked (and I'm not the only one)) but you can't chainsmoke them. The smoke is heavy and really harsh to the throat.<br>  And it's the kind of cigarette that sells less. The industry makes cigarettes that are easy to smoke and more attractive to more people in order to increase the size of the market.<br>  <br>  I don't smoke anymore, I've been out of smoke for many many years. But I still remember those chalas and I'd like to have one once in a while. You can also get cigars made with natural untreated tobacco. Or maybe not due to the cuban embargo... but I can.|`|V4ohsvG4aa	Well, if you just put nicotine in, it would be kind of tasteless, gross, etc. The other chemicals are primarily used to kind of 'flavor' the thing so that there are buyers. Also, you can't smoke with pure nicotine, that would probably kill you. Yes, it is harmful, especially with all the added ingredients in it.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	i dont think the harm of cigarettes would be cut in half, <br>  since i never heard of anyone addicted to ammonia

GGnaREcbaa	Your routine is pretty insane. lol<br>  But yes, it is very possible, but at that rate, you'd loose more that 10lbs in one month, which is bad. 10lbs is a very reasonable goal. I would at least give my body 2 days out of the week for rest or else you'll injure yourself. Then you won't want to exercise for a good while cause your hurt. <br>  <br>  Stretch a lot to help your muscles grow. Think of your muscles as furnaces...as they grow (I don't mean bulky growth)..they burn off all your fat.<br>  <br>  Also, remember food weight and water weight is way different than fat weight.

Your diet intake looks good and you have regular moderate to intense exercises activities in your life. These regular activities could present a problem because your body maybe used to constant workouts and not lose weight as fast as you want, I would probably talk to a personal trainer or do some internet searches to find out different areas in your body like thighs for instance that you can target to lose more weight, I hope this helps you.

They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.  When you get regular, your period will start anywhere from 25-35 days apart and all are normal, but most are usually about 28 days.<br>  <br>  welcome to womanhood..|`|wuZXqYPGaa	ya when ur young like 13 you dont really know ur cycle all too well. you got to keep track of ur period cycle every month on the calendar to know if its normal for it to not come every month. if it makes you feel better when i first started my period it was soo off and it came unexpectidly not perfectly every month, and now my period comes once every two months, its rad... so dont worry too much about it, unless you develop major problems with cramps or abnormal flow no frets :)|`|1OA8ZegTaa	It is normal when you are young that your period is irregular.

MRI is structual not functional. If you want to see differences between a clinically depressed brain and a healthy you would need an fMRI (functional MRI) that measures differences in METABOLISM not structure/anatomy. You can see variations in a whole host of psych disorders but they aren't diagnostic by any means.

qImMwhUHaa	The "bite" is probably off. Just call the dentist and they will fix it for no charge. Make sure he uses the articulation paper (looks like ink paper in a clip) that you bite on. sometimes they get in a hurry and just don't. That's what it sounds like to me. OR it could have been a deep filling that he didn't get all the way out and it abscessed. In that case you would need a root canal.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	could be infected..see a Dr or go back to the dentist...you need antibiotics.|`|AA10216571	If I were you I'd call my dentist.Sometimes a filling causes the bite to be off a little and has to be  adjusted.|`|c63c1a8a3f313613d03647643c55dd58aa	Maybe the Dentist needs to re-check your bite.  You could be biting too hard in a area near the filling and the filling could be "higher" than the rest of the teeth.<br>  Spring is also a favorite time for root canal flare ups too.<br>  I would get bite-wing rechecked for sure.....|`|4UV5423Qaa	she's right. did they give you antibiotics? if they did, did you take em all, and as instructed? make sure you do when they do and youll be ok. learn to love the pain. crave it. be one with it.|`|cRjRZ2lEaa	You should go see the dentist. I had some fillings done a month ago and my teeth were sore for maybe a week or 2, but then the pain went away.  If it isnt going away, you may be getting an infection.|`|HV648cg5aa	The filling may not have covered the whole section it was supposed to, or you may not have had the whole cavity removed, or there may be an infection.  The other possibility is the tooth may just be sensitive.<br>  You should go see your dentist again.
UJD2eYebaa	Did you use a new bath product or lotion?  I'm guessing an allergic reaction to something.  My daughter used a ton of bubble bath one night (like the entire bottle) & immediately broke out all over.  Of course you should get it checked by a dr.

N9nJWYa5aa	Yes your diet can affect your brain, if you eat the wrong foods you'll be sleepy and inattentive, you can even feel slightly fuzzy, almost drunk.<br>  <br>  Frankly your diet is so extreme I'm surprised you have the energy to jog for even 20 minutes!  You certainly need to eat more for breakfast, try to include some complex carbs, to keep both your physical and mental energy up.  When it comes to your lunch, you can eat pretty as much green salad as you like (go easy on oil based dressings though).  For your dinner, make sure you are not eating too late in the day, but this would be a good time to try and get more protein into your diet.  Above all, try to make your diet more interesting, you have well more than a 1000 calories to play with per day if you want to be fit and lose weight.<br>  <br>  If your diet is making you lackluster and by the sounds of it a bit depressed then ask yourself - is this truly healthy?|`|xlo64cWzaa	It can but honestly it depends all on what your limiting yourself from. If your going to be eating alot of carbohydrates it will keep you more awake and give you more energy which will be good.But i cant think of anything that will treat you brain badly. Take some vitamins and minerals to help with the tiredness and eat a good amount of protein and carbohydrates that will make you less tired and give you more energy.<br>  <br>  The diet you have is very simple but i dont think it will work find another diet that will suit all your needs you need the protein and carbohydrates and vegetables and fruit. Good luck|`|NuU3O1Liaa	Actually, you don't need to diet per se to lose weight, the one diet that definitely worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials left, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I melted away thrity pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|6W1dM1n1aa	You should stop eating such dangerously low calorie intake, it's all or nothing, eat at least 1750 calories a day or take a 3 day fast. eating between 200-1000 calories per day is dangerous as it prevents keitosis.

dM1IsKdZaa	You simply have to burn more calories than you take in. That's it. I didn't say easy, I said SIMPLE. You can't spot reduce fat. You need to exercise 20-30 minutes most days of the week. Go to a website like freedieting.com and determine your calorie needs. Eat several small meals a day.Eat more fruits and vegetables. Feed yourself something small and healthy every couple of hours (apple, handful of nuts, yogurt, etc) to keep your metabolism going and to prevent ravenous hunger. Write down everything you eat- I bet you are eating way more than you realize. Stay away from fad diets, watch portion size and watch liquid calories (coke, fruit juices, etc). Indulge in an occasional sweet treat or you'll likely gorge.You should set goals; a healthy pace to lose weight is about 1-2 pounds a week. Good luck.|`|AA11447210	You can eat right and do cardio exercise to burn fat from all over your body, but if the chin is hereditary you may still have a little extra skin there when you are done.<br>  <br>  Get to your target weight/size and maintain it for a while.

Lift your head and pull your bottom lip right up over your top lip.  Once you've done that push your tongue up hard on the roof of your mouth.  You will feel under your chin tightening.  Do this 5 times, holding for 5 seconds each time to begin with then add a few more as you get used to the exercise.  You might want to lose a pound or two in weight if your face is a bit full. That will also help. Good luck
a50adc767b2a79758a91103f0f987b08aa	Many athletes have long been devoted advocates of the health benefits of infrared saunas. Regular exposure to monitored heat levels has been linked to enhanced physical performance, higher endurance levels, and an increased threshold for anaerobic exercise. For fitness enthusiasts, infrared saunas can be beneficial when used as a supplement for regular fitness routines as a means of burning extra calories (up to 500 in a full session), eliminating more fat cells, and boosting overall metabolism. Sweating also increases blood circulation throughout the body. Although they should not be used as a substitute for cardiovascular exercise, the health benefits of saunas make them advantageous as a follow-up component of a regular workout regimen.|`|RuFZABFxaa	If you start showing yellow juices like a bird then it's time to leave the sauna.  You can't lose fat in there.  It also activates your pores which can make some people break out.  Nice.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	You loose water weight by sweating.

Every-ones digestive system is different though and it depends a lot on how long its been since you went. If its a long time it will probably take longer than that. I certainly wouldn't take them before you meet your friend, just in case!

You need to exercise 20-30 minutes most days of the week. Go to a website like freedieting.com and determine your calorie needs. Eat several small meals a day.Eat more fruits and vegetables. Feed yourself something small and healthy every couple of hours (apple, handful of nuts, yogurt, etc) to keep your metabolism going and to prevent ravenous hunger. Write down everything you eat- I bet you are eating way more than you realize. Stay away from fad diets, watch portion size and watch liquid calories (coke, fruit juices, etc). Indulge in an occasional sweet treat or you'll likely gorge.You should set goals; a healthy pace to lose weight is about 1-2 pounds a week.

zqv5JzRpaa	The ventricular tachycardias include both ventricular tachycardia itself, and ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a rapid heart rhythm originating within the ventricles. VT tends to disrupt the orderly contraction of the ventricular muscle, so that the ventricle’s ability to eject blood is often significantly reduced. That, combined with the excessive heart rate, can reduce the amount of blood actually being pumped by the heart during VT to dangerous levels. Consequently, while patients with VT can sometimes feel relatively well, often they experience – in addition to the ubiquitous palpitations – extreme lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, or even sudden death.

Try it first.|`|ufgv7oTjaa	Toothpaste is a good treatment for external applications (which will take a while to see the results), but you could also take L-Lysine (an Amino Acid) to help fight it internally, too. L-Lysine can help to get rid of it sooner, plus you can take it safely after you can't see the sore anymore to make sure it's gone.<br>  Also, if you get cold sores on a regular basis, taking L-Lysine can actually help prevent them from coming up again. Oh, and stress tends to aggravate cold sores, so reducing stress may help as well. Good luck!|`|OST33XFNaa	Cold sores can sometimes be an indicator of low tissue calcium.  If you are getting an adequate amount of calcium from your diet, you may not have enough vitamin F (polyunsaturated fats) to drive calcium into your tissues.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like Calcium Lactate from Standard Process.  The product is slightly acidic for maximum absorption unlike other calcium lactate products available on the internet.  I recommend trying this first to see if this will resolve the sores.  If not, then add Cataplex F from Standard Process to the regimen.<br>  <br>  Stress and/or low immune system may also be why cold sores occur.  In which case, acupuncture can be very effective in reducing stress and strengthening the immune system.<br>  <br>  Yours in Health & Wellness,<br>  <br>  Hiroyuki Nakamura<br>  Licensed Acupuncturist<br>  www.healthyonpurpose.com

yezbmlaKaa	no no no!! not a good idea:<br>  <br>  "Alcohol may increase your risk of liver damage while taking acetaminophen.

There are more than 500 mg's of Tylenol in each pill, if I remember correctly, and this could cause you to develop liver damage.  It is not worth the risk, IMO.|`|aMELFGh0aa	I would strongly recommend that you do not mix alcohol with pain medication. You never know what harm you may cause. You could cause yourself minor brain damage and not even realize it. Seriously, it's not worth the risk.

Im not saying to bulk up, just tone and burn fat.

I became irregular.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	you have to be 13 to be on here.<br>  <br>  we dont know why|`|mnkZ6VS9aa	Your period is irregular, and that's normal. I doubt you've had your period for a long time. Sometimes it can take up until you're in your 20's before your period is regulated.
9Rt93HJ3aa	I know what you're going through TRUST me! I don't think you would actually kill yourself, I've thought about it but when you actually go up to do it, you'll realize everything you have and that you will lose it. I'm only 17, but I was in your spot, I use to drink alcohol a lot whenever I got the chance... I'd drink as fast as I could to just make myself feel better... but it never helped. I said to myself one day, "This isn't helping, I don't want to be this person." I guess you have to experience it yourself for you to understand me. At your age, it could also be puberty. You have a lot of emotions scrambling at that time. My advice, hang out with your friends as much as you can, find a hobby or two, play a sport, anything to avoid being alone. When you're alone you can't do anything else but think. Keep yourself occupied bro, and stay out of trouble.|`|bexpzOGfaa	Being a teenager will be the hardest part of your life. Learn to take control of your emotions, if your sad try and do things that make you happy. No One can make you feel inferior without your consent. The lessons you learn as a teenager will help you through your life. Its a bumpy road but when you get over it will be worse it. Its not only happening to you, its happening to everyone around you. Everyone is having a hard time people just deal with it differently, its the people who seem to have the perfect life usually have the most messed up life. Also your hormones might have to do about it. Talk to your doctor about it, your doctor wont be aloud to tell anyone without your permission. <br>  Dont worry be happy|`|xwfdn6Xkaa	I know what you are going thought I am 22 years old and I have similar situation like you but I never actually tired to kill myself the last time was 6 years ago since then never (Whole lot of changes when I was younger).  I am on a anti-depressant I have spoken to my doctor and following my treatment plan he also referred me to a psychiatrist I have been diagnosed with depression now I didn't take into consideration that I may have had a problem when I was younger in high school.<br>  <br>  Speak to your doctor and please get better.|`|ovYREdGmaa	listen, dont EVER kill yourself...its not worth it and no one wants you to die<br>  your problems are only temporary<br>   but it sounds like you have clinical depression, i would tell your parents first since they should care about you, and then you can get more help|`|CBfGXLvKaa	HUGS its very common at your age with changing hormones and such. You need to see a Dr, if you dont want to go to mom or dad, go to your school guidance counselor!|`|AA11820571	Ok, don't get drunk, alcohol is a depressant! Not to mention you are under age to be drinking anyway.<br>  <br>  You are a teen and your hormones are going crazy. Until they balance out, you will have times of depression. But you can make it much worse with drugs, alcohol and improper diet. Eat healthy, get exercise and think about what you can do to help others.

nVeGysnSaa	I had this exact problem exactly around your age. I'm not going to say it's your age though because you shouldn't be feeling like this. Nothing is wrong with you. But do you have any idea, any reason that you migtht be feeling like this? Any death in the family recently? Do you ever get made fun of? Any or ALOT of stress going on right now? Well to answer you question it DOES sound like you had A anxiety attack I used to get the all the time and I STILL DO. Fortunately there ARE things you can do to relieve yourself from this. Try to find exactly what is wrong with you. This sounds stupid and I was sceptic to try it BUT take A really deep breath and release whenever you start shaking or crying and everything else that happened to you. Yes what you went through is VERY scary but your NOT going to die from it although it DOES seem like it. What you went through is VERY REAL and you shouldn't have to go through it. If you ARE feeling suicidal and or depressed you SHOULD DEFINITELY talk to you mom about it. Go up to her first thing after you read this and tell her everything. Don't leave anything out. If you don't know why your feeling like this then tell her. PLEASE DO NOT overdose on pills or do anything else. TRUST ME I has this same problem and now im very happy. You are going through A very awkard, weird, hard stage at your age. So YES go to your mom and ask her to maybe go to A therapist (Although A therapist is not God they won't be able to completely help you) But for sure look into that. Don't waste anytime doing that. Also another thing you could do is go to Borders Book Store and go get a book that describes Anxiety Attacks (Also Anxiety Attacks can be called Panick Attacks). I bought A book on that and it gave me more information then A therapist. BUT that was just ONE Therapist I went to. Please do eat and know you ARE worth the nutrition to eat healthy and be nurished. About those breathing excercises PLEASE do them, All you have to do is take A really deep breath through your nose and release through your mouth keep doing it over and over again and really focus on relaxing. I think the breathing excersices have helped me more then ANYTHING i've tried. Eventually you will KNOW that you don't deserve to go through this, And even talking about what your feeling WILL make you feel better. Trust me that's not just some stupid "Saying" it really does help to vent your problems. PLEASE do what I have written I HAVE BEEN THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT YOUR GOING THROUGH and believe me IT DOES GET BETTER (Even though it really doesn't seem like it). Good luck and please post how your doing I'm very interested and concerned. <br>  -Your new internet friend =)|`|AA11610448	it's time to tell your mom and see a professional.  your symptoms could be either or neither.  prozac might be one drug they would try on you, but there are lots of others as well and combinations.|`|ovYREdGmaa	It defenitely sounds like you have depression and anxiety, but this is normal for most teens. All I can say is don't ever kill yourself, and even if you dont believe there are people out there who care about you and would never want to see you hurt yourself. <br>  Yes, tell your mom so you can see a doctor

The tampon will not go too far in.<br>  <br>  When I was still having a period I used OB tampons, which eliminated the applicator problem alltogether.  If you decide to try the OB ones, they have no applicator.  You widen the base of them and then push it up with your finger, as far as your finger will go.  And thats about where it should be inside your body.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the type you choose, most of them have instructions which have diagrams in them.

kf26i7J1aa	I do not weight much, and I keep it that way by playing sports. I used to play soccer, so that's a good sport, and trampolines will help a little if you jump on it enough. I also play basketball, and running hard really keeps me thin. Also, check your diet. Don't randomly decide you're hungry and then eat cookies. Either ignore that feeling until the next mealtime, or eat something healthy/healthyish for a snack. (Granola bar, apple, orange, carrots, yogurt. . .) If you have friends that live in your neighborhood, walk to their house or walk them home if they come over to your house.|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	Change your mindset a bit.  Since we do not know how much you have gained we would not know how much of the weight you could lose.  Realistically, you could lose perhaps 10 pounds in a months time.  In order to lose more, you would have to drastically change your eating and work out habits.  That may not be good if you do not intend to commit to a life change like that.  Being healthy is the goal not thinness please keep this in mind.  You may not have a weight issue.<br>  <br>  You ate well and worked out but only for a temporary period which is why the results were also temporary.  Somehow you have to learn to know your eating habits and learn to compromise them with healthier eating habits.  This is the only way to counteract binge eating.  In actuality binge eating with healthy foods cant hurt as much as it does with junk foods.  <br>  <br>  Do the following and it will help you gain a conscious mind to stop bingeing.  Okay everyday keep a journal of what you eat for all your meals and snacks.  Try to learn what your eating habits are, what it is or why it is you binge eat? Is it an psychological or emotional issue in your life causing you to overeat?  Yes, this can happen and happens to many ppl myself included.  Have you ever considered bingeing on healthy foods?  I heard a well known dietician say that instead of bingeing on junk food, try up to three healthy snacks and if you are still not satisfied have something you like but you must eat three healthy snacks first.  It usually does work for me because I have a similar problem.<br>  <br>  I can empathize because back in like late Dec/January I had lost a bit of weight I was almost smaller than I had been as an adult size 4 but I have been binge eating and its starting to catch up with me.  Right now, my weight is not a major issue however I want to tackle it before it does become a yoyo thing.  An easy 5-10 pounds lost will get me back where I was.  The summer is coming around and I want to be comfortable in my own skin for once, I am very self critical. Now that my mother who was overweight has lost about twenty pounds since Novemeber/Dec, it makes me more conscious about my weight.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Edit: Avoid eating late because that is the quickest way to gain weight.  Try to eat at least 2 hours before you sleep. Work out on a daily basis to burn the extra calories.  Drink plenty of water, avoid sodas and overly sugary drinks/coffees|`|DqEyrDYhaa	hey!<br>  You need to really focus on want you want out of this. next time you see something you want to binge on tell yourself, I've tasted that before, it's not gonna taste any different. there is no need to binge eat.

I've now lost about 30 from just riding my bike about two miles a day and eating healthier.<br>  I cut out sodas and limited myself to one sweet a week if I felt I had eaten well that week. if you are having a bad day go ahead and eat a sweet. ONE sweet. if you can just keep sweets and junk out of your house all together.<br>  you can lose 5-10 pounds before the 10th if you work really hard. <br>  I'm looking at losing weight long term so I'll be glad to email back and forth with you about dieting and exercises. :D|`|HhKOOX8zaa	do a lot of exercise.and at lunch or dinner make sure you eat healthy things like salads and soup and those types but eat a lot of it for that your so full that you wont want to eat other things.or just by the things you like but only in small amounts. you could probably lose a lot of pounds till summer.good luck you can do it.|`|vunAIGVwaa	Same as me!

Some think it's psychological and others lost their weight too quickly and in an unhealthy matter, however abiding by a couple of rules will certainly help you lose and maintain your weight in a healthy range. I hope this tips help you in your trip!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #1. Eat specific foods. A number of food additives, like spices, can help to speed up your metabolism by creating a thermodynamic burn that has been shown to last a few hours after you eat. <br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #2. Time your meals. The majority of your calories should be earlier in the day. Your meals should contain less total calories as the day goes on. Try to eat little or preferably nothing at all after your evening meal. Don't skip any meals. You should be eating 4 - 6 meals each day. <br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #3. Make sure you eat enough. One of the biggest mistakes people make when trying to lose weight is they don't eat enough. <br>  If you don't consume the proper amount of calories you will send your body into what is known as a survival mode. This happens when your body does not have enough calories, so it conserves energy to prepare for possible starvation.<br>  On the opposite side of this, is if you eat too many calories the excess will be stored as fat. You need to exercise in order to burn more calories than you eat. Therefore, moderation is the key when it comes to calorie intake.<br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #4. Increase your daily activities. To prevent fat storage and to drop any excess that you might be carrying you must increase your daily activities.<br>  This needs to include weight training and cardiovascular training. The more calories you burn, the faster you will lose weight. It's that simple. An increase in lean muscle mass results in a dramatic increase in fat burning.<br>  One more thing try to exercise first thing in the morning. Research has shown that you can dramatically increase your fat burning ability if you exercise after a fasted state. Meaning just after you wake up. <br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #5. Do weight lifting before doing any cardiovascular work. The only exception of course is to perform 5 - 10 minutes of cardio before your weight training in order to warm up your muscles.<br>  This is important because you need the energy in your muscles for weight training. By the time your weight training session is complete you will have used up all of your preferred energy sources. <br>  This means that you will actually be burning fat cells during your cardio session.<br>  Here's what happens if you do this in reverse.<br>  First, you will only be burning carbohydrate sources of energy during your cardiovascular workout. No fat cells will be used up for energy. Next, you will not have the energy in your muscles in order to get the most out of your weight training.<br>  You will not be able to increase your lean muscle, which is very important if you want to lose your excess weight.<br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #6. Change up your exercise routine on a regular basis. For the most part you should change some aspect of your workout every 2 - 3 weeks. This can be anything from the number of reps or sets per exercise. The exercise order you perform and the exercises themselves. <br>  If you do the same thing week after week, month after month your body will start to get used to what you're doing to it and will eventually stop making changes. You will also stop adding any more lean muscle.<br>  The more muscle you have the more calories you will burn even when at rest. <br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #7. Meal combinations. Always eat protein / carbohydrate meals earlier in the day. Eat protein / fat combination meals (meaning little to no carbohydrates) in the late afternoon and evening. <br>  The only exception is if you normally exercise in the evening. Then your first meal after your workout should consist of protein and carbohydrates. <br>  Never eat carbohydrates and fat together in the same meal. <br>  With these seven fast weight loss tips you will speed up metabolism and burn excess body fat at a much faster rate.<br>  3 months ago

Most women experience urine incontinence rather than bowel, but it's still a problem either way. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is kegel exorcises. These will strengthen the muscles in the vaginal wall, thus strengthening the muscles that control your bladder. I've included a link with step by step instructions on how to do these. <br>  <br>  While you're doing your strength training, get some thin pantyliners and wear them at all times. Or, you can change your undies constantly. It may seem a little embarrassing but with the exorcises you should be able to faze out of these within a few weeks. <br>  <br>  You're not alone. Funny story, I'm 26 weeks pregnant and while I was experiencing morning sickness I couldn't help but constantly hurl everything I had eaten at least twice a day. One morning I was sitting outside on my front porch when I got the urge to vomit, and of course I did, all over my bath robe, pants and slippers. Meanwhile, I accidentally had both a number one and two potty break. I mentioned it to my doctor at my next visit and the kegel is what she recommended.

I said… ARE YOU READY FOR THE NEWEST WEIGHT LOSS BREAKTHROUGH!?!? Well you better be… because here it comes.<br>  <br>  Most people know that the average person should typically aim to lose 1 or 2 pounds per week. Well, what if I told you that there is a way where you can lose not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4… but up to 5 POUNDS IN JUST ONE DAY!!! That’s right. Not one month… not one week… one day!<br>  <br>  Is this something you’d be interested in? I knew you would. But wait… there’s more!<br>  <br>  What if I said that you can lose up to 5 pounds in just one day… WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES TO YOUR DIET! What was that sound? Was that your head exploding at the thought of this amazing weight loss breakthrough? I knew it was! But hold on… there’s still more!<br>  <br>  What if I said you can lose up to 5 pounds in just one day without changing your diet… and WITHOUT EXERCISING! If you still had a head, it would have just exploded. But wait… there is still more!<br>  <br>  What if I said that everything I just mentioned above can happen… FOR FREE! And not only that, but it’s 100% SAFE as well!<br>  <br>  Did you just die from excitement? I knew that would happen. If there is anyone still alive at this point, keep reading. I’m about to tell you how you can experience this amazing weight loss breakthrough for yourself!<br>  <br>  In order for you to lose up to 5 pounds in one day (safely and for free) without changing your diet or exercising, there are just two requirements:<br>  <br>     1. You need to have a scale.<br>     2. You need to be able to tell the difference between day and night.<br>  <br>  Sound simple? That’s because it is! Here’s what you do…<br>  <br>  Tonight, right before you go to sleep, go get your scale and weigh yourself. Once you do it, write down what your weight was and keep it in a safe place. Again, the key here is to weigh yourself at night right before bed. Then… just go to sleep. IT’S JUST THAT EASY!<br>  <br>  Now here comes the second part. This is where all the magic happens. When you wake up the next morning, before eating or drinking anything, go get your scale and weigh yourself again. That’s right, you are going to weigh yourself first thing the next morning.<br>  <br>  …and that’s it! Did you see it?

bOaqWNxRaa	I am sorry that you're feeling this anxiety. But I promise you it will eventually fade away. <br>  <br>  Try to identify what specifically is causing the anxiety. Also, pray about it. God loves you, and he doesn't give us a spirit of fear. Anxiety is just a euphemism for fear. But hey, I know what you're going through. I have OCD, anxiety, and severe depression, myself. God has truly helped me in times of strife. I thank him. <br>  <br>  Are you taking medications? I take 30mg of Prozac daily. It helps a lot to ease the anxiety and the depression.<br>  <br>  Are you having claustrophobia? I understand what it's like to need to get out some. <br>  <br>  Can you make a compromise with your caregiver? Offer to do her favors, and in exchange, she can take you somewhere so that you can enjoy yourself a little. Go wherever you wish- a book store, a mall, the movies. And offer her something- offer to wash the dishes, or do some house chores in exchange for her taking you somewhere. Tell your Mom that you are experiencing some anxiety, and that you really need to get out of the house for a little while. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and God bless!|`|AA10500537	call a freind and ask her to take you out just for a drive ofr for coffee|`|7BoXLwIkaa	I have the exact same problem if she doesn't help u look to a school counselour or another family member|`|Bu0rcFbMaa	I suffer from anxiety very badly so I hope I can help you out.<br>  <br>  If your getting panic attacks, some thigns that helped me calm down and that is all natural (i'm not one for medication) is Bach's Rescue Remedy. Its a spray, or you can get a dropper, that you put under your tounge when you feel panicked. It seem to help me out a lot.<br>  <br>  Another thing is changes in your diet. You should eat more fish, particularlily tuna. Also, getting more vitamin C helps.<br>  <br>  Massage therapy is a great choice as well.<br>  <br>  Also, ytour caregiver might not udnerstand. Its such a hard disease to explain.. and unless you've gone through anxiety you will just not understand. I would encourage her to talk to a mental health expert just to get some more information, or read up on it.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best.
fAFXkikAaa	Once you are infected with the herpes virus, it never goes away.   Because you had cold sores, you have herpes - and will always have herpes.   This is why you tested positive for herpes.<br>  <br>  HSV1 is the virus that "prefers" the mouth, but it can infect the genitals.<br>  <br>  HSV2 is the strain that "prefers" the genitals, but can infect the mouth.<br>  <br>  "Oral herpes" is having either HSV1 or HSV2 on your mouth.<br>  "Genital herpes" means having either strain on your genitals.<br>  <br>  So, to take your questions in order:<br>  <br>  Yes, the HSV1 virus has been lying dormant in your body.<br>  <br>  Yes and No - either virus can infect either place, but HSV1 is most commonly associated with oral infections.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is VERY common to have oral herpes.  50% to 80% of adults have it.  Almost everyone is in EXACTLY the same situation you are.  They had cold sores as a child, and don't realize that means that they have oral herpes.<br>  <br>  Your friends will not reject you because you don't need to tell them.  Oral herpes is NOT an STD.  Its incredibly common, and if you have no symptoms, then there is absolutely no reason for anyone to know.<br>  <br>  If you get a cold sore, don't kiss anyone, and don't give anyone oral sex.   Thats all you need to do.<br>  <br>  For more information about oral herpes, I recommend checking out the website below.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ioBfCtRQaa	Majority of people have HSV 1 which mainly causes cold sores. Once you have it, you have it forever. Having doesn't mean you will have sores though. Many people are carriers with no signs or symptoms except when they first get it, such you had years ago. It is usually nothing to worry too much about as long as you don't have sores, that is when it is mainly transmitted. If you have sores, avoid contact, especially oral sex b/c you can give genital herpes to someone else with your oral herpes. HSV 1 is usually much less severe than HSV 2 which is the predominant genital herpes and more severe strain. As with all herpes, there is no guarantee you won't spread the virus at other times, but it seems that majority of people won't have problems unless there are active sores at the time of transmission.|`|nF0Eaa2Gaa	Herpes simplex is what they call an opportunistic virus. It lies dormant within the body until your immune system is down or fighting other infections which is the perfect opportunity to cause an outbreak. <br>  <br>  Your body's immune system has done well with keeping it under control but since there's no cure for herpes you'll always be a carrier and are susceptible to outbreaks. Or consider that you may have contracted another form after 15 years. Stay healthy and keep your immune system strong for less outbreaks.|`|4ZE8RG7Waa	Hello you know in the uk where i live 80% of people have the hsv 1 virus that you have which is responsible for coldsores it's really so common so please dont worry..yes once contracted the herpes virus stays dormant in the body your body has done really well to keep it dormant this long!<br>  so dont think your alone because most people have it it's more the genital hsv 2 that has such a stigma!|`|fk9AvB25aa	Cold sores can be caused by herpes simplex 1 which is why you tested positive for it.<br>  Herpes of any type can lie dormant in the body for long periods of time even after you contracted it because your body can suppress it. It is very common to have HSV1 in fact 50-80 percent of the world has it all ready. Young children can even get cold sores before they become sexually active. Cold sores do not cause HSV2. HSV2 is an std and cold sores are not considered to be one since there are other ways then having sex to get cold sores. Your doctor is a little wrong, HSV2 is sexually transmitted not usually HSV1 but HSV1 can be passed from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex<br>  HSV1 and HSV2 positive in Canada so your not alone.

In the final stages of starvation, adult humans experience a variety of neurological and psychiatric symptoms, including hallucinations and convulsions, as well as severe muscle pain and disturbances in heart rhythm.|`|AA11447210	How can you consider passing out not a "huge effect"? What if you were driving a car or operating something that could harm you or someone else should you become unconscious?<br>  <br>  Passing out is a HUGE effect dear. You are starving yourself...in other words, committing suicide slowly. If you let it go too far, damage done may not be reversible even if you begin to eat in a healthy manner and continue to do so forever.<br>  <br>  Keep seeking out counselors until you find someone whose advice you will listen to...or it may become too late. "Most doctors and nutritionist state that the average person can live about 4 to 6 weeks without food...An individual with ample body fat can last longer without food. Those who fit into the obese category are able to last anywhere between 4 to 25 weeks, sometimes longer due to the metabolisms ability to supply energy to the body by using up the fat storage supply."|`|JoQFqoTSaa	when you starve yourselfe you stomach starts to eat your stomach lining thats the growling affect
SCmlFFrMaa	When the body goes into starvation mode it starts to burn a lot less calories than it did when it was taking in a healthy amount of calories and the body's metabolism slows down in order to let the body survive. If the metabolism stayed the same the body would burn calories too fast and eventually would run out of energy sources and ultimately the body would die from malnutrition. If you start eating above 1200 calories after your body has gone into starvation mode it will store all those calories as fat in order to prepare your body for possible starvation in the near future and to replenish your body of nutrients.<br>  <br>  Basically, there is nothing positive that can happen to your body if you eat below 1200 calories and starve yourself. You may lose weight but your body will be very unhealthy from it and as soon as you would eat a healthy amount of calories you would gain all your weight back. Starvation = Bad idea|`|JS1jQomHaa	im not completly sure about but i do know that when your body goes into starvation mode it begins to eat away at your fat, muscle and organs. this could seriously damge your health because your body will be using energy to eat away at your body and you wont have enough energy to fight off illnesses and become really sick.<br>  <br>  --x--|`|YTn2ETtQaa	Hi there.

Kiq9LSmtaa	Lorna:  I can tell you that they wanted to give me the surgery for reflux.<br>  I stayed on Zantac(300mg) for 15yrs.  I no longer take the 300's I only take the otc 75mg everyday.  My Dad did have it done and he has had no problems at all.  The thing is that you must have someone who knows what they are doing - if they tighten it too much you will have a hard time swallowing for very long time.  My Dad had to have the opening expanded after the surgery, they use what is like a latex sock and pour merckury into it and let it go through the opening and then they pull it back through to expand the opening.  That is what I thought to be the most dangerous part of the whole thing.<br>  I can tell you that after all that he does still have to watch what he eats to avoid acid reflux.  I rarely have reflux any more I just keep taking the zantac for maintainence.  Hope this is helpfull...Jon
85kkL7i6aa	You are probably pregnant with a poop-baby.  Congratulations.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Unless sperm entered your vagina you can not become pregnant.|`|QB5D0rG4aa	It is very unlikely that there will be a chance of getting pregnant when having anal sex. If you do not use a condom and he cums outside of you, and some of it were to get close to the opening of the vagina, it could get inside and travel into the fallopian tubes. However, using a condom or not, this is very unlikely. Don't worry about it!|`|ldXSIWEyaa	there is a very small chance. the only way you could get pregnant from anal sex is if the sperm got far into your vagina. which probably never happens. i wouldnt worry about it. sometimes worrying can prolong a period from starting. and no there is nothing you can do to have your period faster. just stop worrying and maybe it will come|`|K4zsztkRaa	I think you are just sycking yourself out.

If you don't get your period for the next four or five days, then think about taking a pregnancy test.|`|O2s8tLQzaa	Yes, there's a chance. While anus and vagina's canal were nearby to each other. Who knows the sperm may flew and made contact with vaginal mucus.<br>  <br>  Anyway, unless he's using condom, maybe the chance is impossible, but realizing the area is so close one to another, there will be always a chance of pregnancy. Because some positions, may lead the sperm to flow into the vagina's zone, like doggy.|`|4MTzp8hMaa	Nope, you cannot its safe against pregnancy. To get pregnant you must have semen inside your vagina. Although you can get STD's and what not from having anal sex.|`|T1R6UZDOaa	NO you can not get pregnant from having anal sex.

PAvYZJK2aa	it is fine|`|E64juLwJaa	Of course it is ok:use an electric beard trimmer.<br>  Planets|`|tX2giFynaa	Perhaps the most basic and judicious way involved in removing pubic hair and cutting away the shag hiding your junk is simply to trim it back. Two affordable options exist: scissors and electric trimmers. Scissors are acceptable when used by skilled hands, but an electric trimmer is highly recommended for removing pubic hair. Scissors, aside from being dangerous to wield around such a sensitive area, can result in an uneven, scraggly look that almost defeats the purpose unless you’re careful. Be smart, use a trimmer.<br>  <br>  Pros<br>  <br>      * Affordable option(s) exist that can be purchased/stored without any embarrassment.<br>      * With a trimmer, you get a uniform, complementary length of pubic hair.<br>      * Maintenance is relatively easy.<br>  <br>  Cons<br>      * Cleanup can be a mess since you need to trim your pubic hair while it’s dry.<br>      * With scissors, you can end up with a choppy-looking bush that’s comical instead of alluring.<br>      * Maintenance requires frequent upkeep and attention (every 12-14 days, depending).|`|qzpQdJ44aa	Of course.

xtih8qXVaa	How many questions have you asked about your penis in here? Four? Five? <br>  <br>  I seriously think you need to relax and stop obsessing about your penis. There is no "normal" size. They come in all sizes, shapes, angles, some are circumcised, some are not. It's perfectly normal for the head to be a red colour - especially as you become aroused. Whether you want to shave your pubes or trim is your personal decision. You need to decide what is most comfortable for you.<br>  <br>  And above all - quit obsessing and worrying over it so! I have a feeling you are young and well, frankly your body and this includes your penis are still in a state of fluctuation and growth.|`|E64juLwJaa	The color is normal and penises come in all kinds of shapes:you need not and cannot change this<br>  Planets|`|i6RlYFo7aa	youre normal<br>  the head can go from pink to reddish to purple because of blood flow|`|SltEwVX7aa	nope.<br>  <br>  penis heads can range in color from light pink to dark purple.  and there's nothing you can do about the shape.|`|NIlDPtNeaa	Penises come in all different shapes, colours and sizes.<br>  The colours can vary from pink-purple.|`|N0N9FzEhaa	Yea of course you can change it!!!

I know someone who had the same thing happen and had D&C about 6 months ago, so I'm betting that it's just your particular doctor who doesn't "DO" D&C. <br>  <br>  I am sorry you are having to go through this. Please speak with another health care professional, preferably a women's health clinic who you can be confident is being completely honest with you, immediately. Good luck!
xmibEEdcaa	No, really not a good idea.  For one thing, codeine and hydrocodone are both opioids. It's not a good idea to combine opioids unless a doctor has explicitly directed you to do so.  <br>  <br>  For another, you'd be taking in 800mg of Tylenol: 500 from the vicodin, and then another 300 from the Tylenol 3.  That's an awful lot of Tylenol to be taking at one time.  1000 is the maximum amount of Tylenol you should ever take at once, and it's really best not to come too close to that number at all.  <br>  <br>  If you're in a lot of pain, and neither the vicodin nor the T3 is doing it for you on its own anymore, you should ask your doctor to change your prescription to something stronger. You really don't want to find yourself taking too much Tylenol. It's an even more dangerous drug than the opioids themselves in some respects, as taking too much of it can cause permanent and incurable liver damage, which is a very nasty way to go.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Hydrocodone is 5 mg. of codone and 500 mg of acetominophen per pill.  Tylenol 3 is 5 mg of codeine and 500 mg of acetominophen per pill.  You should never combine codone and codeine because they can 'interact' in your body.  Call your doctor's office for more information.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	If your asking if you can take 5 of them at one time the answer is NO. your kidneys will shut down and you will have complete liver failure.|`|OUpCQz4haa	If your Doctor permits it follow his instructions.

Well I can offer you a suggestion...  I do not know you religious beliefs but you can get help from your local pastor and it sounds like it is time for you to do so.  I am Pentecostal and our church helps in these matters when they come up.  If your fathers is to ever overcome he will have to find help at this level.

6Wdl6UFdaa	I say you will gradually lose weight, but not neccesarily right to 105. Its good that your not starving yourself inorder to lose weight, thats a common misconception, and it could be detrimental. Your breakfast looks nutritious, some carbs, fibre, dairy, and fruits. Your lunch is good too, turkey breast, low in fat/cholesterol, good source of protein. Tuna, yet another good source of protein, same as chicken. Although becareful about chicken, lots of hormones in there :O. just dont each too much or too less. The whole idea is to consume less calories then you spend if you want to lose weight, and eat more if you want to gain weight.

It puts weight on. <br>  Secondly, meat does the same thing plus it hardens and glogs your arteries, and with bread, it creates excess mucus in your stomach / through your body.<br>  <br>  The perfect diet to lose weight would beee.... for breakfast, fruits and nuts and things like that. Lunch... salads and greens, for dinner you could have mayyyybe fish...<br>  <br>  If you change your diet to strictly fruits, vegetables and nuts, you will lose weight before your eyes. I know it's hard to get rid of the meat and dairy and all, but it works, trust me.|`|jL8K9dMPaa	Well I would say just keep exercising and stick to low calorie foods if you want to lose weight. But I wouldn't recommend it, especially at your age. Your body needs weight to turn it into all the things you are going to develop through puberty. If you get rid of all of your excess weight your body won't grow properly. I suggest you don't worry about weight loss until you are done growing.|`|z9nCUpaOaa	It's a good start but you should add more vegetables.|`|CA0Y1tnNaa	It's a healthier way to eat considering how most teenagers eat lately, but the normal weight for someone your age is 120 (actually, depending on your height it may be a few pounds more/less). I suggest only losing ten pounds maximum because you could put yourself up for serious health issues and could put your life in danger. I also strongly suggest talking with your parents about this and having all of you consult with your doctor first, because if anyone is going to be able to give you out of the book and modern-day facts, it would be a doctor; and your parents are your parents plain and simple. This may not be answering your question very much but consider it more of advice rather than an answer. The last place you would want to end up is in a hospital, and in my opinion it's a lot much nicer to be normal and healthy than living up to the fitness standards of today's society.
kU5Xv2i2aa	You are on too much, your Dr is crazy. See a different psychiatrist, check out alternative therapies. EEG biofeedback could help.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	clearly -get some psycho therapy and take control of your life.|`|BGpykTMYaa	have you ever asked your doctor your diagnosis? <br>  obviously those meds are for mood disorders.<br>  but it seems overkill.
vqmAaT7gaa	First, just because you have tested positive for HPV does not mean that it is one of the strains that causes cancer. You have to have a genetic test done on the pap to determine what strain you have.<br>  <br>  You can contract HPV, and then after a time, your body can fight the virus that is causing it, making you test negative for HPV.<br>  <br>  The abnormal pap is caused by the cellular changes that are caused by the virus. And again, just because you have had abnormal cell changes doesn't mean you have a strain that causes cancer. I really can not stress that enough.

It was in highschool, but when I went to college I told myself I could start fresh. I was finally able to act like myself. <br>  <br>  If you don't have to ability to go somewhere else, then I say SCREW IT and act any damn way you please. If they don't like you then SO F^&%ING WHAT? You don't need them to like you (especially if it really isn't you.) You may be surprised that other people in your situation  may come out to you and want to be friends with you because they feel the same way and have also been hiding behind a mask.|`|K8JGxwGXaa	do what you want and f*ck everything else (little miss sunshine)
ufgv7oTjaa	Not so much suppressing it, but Magnolia and Phellodendron (or Philodendron) help to balance out stress-related hormones like Cortisol. There are a few products with those on the market like Relora, Relacore, or similar names. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|AA11615294	No herb or anything will alter your secretion of any hormone including cortisol. You have no control nor would you want it .|`|yE2vM76naa	If the issue is endocrine, then I would say no. <br>  However, if it is simply due to too much stress, I would say that stress reduction would be your first order of business - reduces the entire gluccocortoid cascade (stress hormone response) which includes cortisol.<br>  <br>  Try to get some time in personal enjoyment (for me, its watching to tonight show) meditation (I walk in fresh air) or a bubble bath in regularly. Little things add up.

7c63ef82a9b12c820787a1f534edd972aa	145 at 5'5" might be just a little chubby, not fat though.  Would be a good idea to be careful and maybe exercise some to keep in shape, easier to stay that way than lose it later. You are 15 and a strict diet is not really a good idea. Remember you have curves and deposits of fat places that boys don't and you are supposed to have them. It's what makes girls look good. breasts, round butt, hips. Without them we would be shaped just like the boys|`|gk872x0oaa	I weigh like 139 pounds or something and my height is 5'6.

When Cindy Crawford was at the peak of her modeling career she weighted @ 170 at 5'10". No one ever called her fat.|`|KBL1t21taa	Yeah, you sound a little chubby, but nothing a little diet and excercise can't fix!|`|5Iv3gcwxaa	You are not fat. According to the BMI calculator I just used. BMI is your "Body Mass Index" this tells you if you are underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese, according to your age, height, and weight. I put in your birth year as 1993, since you say you are 15, your height, and your weight. Im not sure if that's the year you were born, but you might want to go back and put in all the information yourself if I'm wrong. The results I got from the information you gave me is: <br>  <br>  "Your BMI is 24.1. That puts you in the 83 percentile, which indicates you are at a healthy weight. The healthy weight range for your height and age is 100 to 147 lbs."<br>  <br>  If you gain anymore weight, you will be considered overweight. But if you are worried or want to feel a little better about your self image, try eating healthier and do some sort of physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day. Hope this helps =)

I'm using lemon right now. It's working pretty well for me. I've also heard that witch hazel is good for the face. Try using these natural remedies consistently to see which one works for you. It can't hurt to try.

The posterior chamber is filled with what is called vitreous humor, everyone has cell debris inside the vitreous humor and that is essentially what you are seeing.  Completely normal I assure you.
xQn3rR6Naa	The human mouth is about the filthiest place you can be, germs are multiplying constantly and any wound has a significant probability of becoming infected.

9HCdu87Taa	Essentially metastasize means that the cancer is using blood vessels and/or the lymphatic system to travel to other areas of the body (Organs, tissue, etc).|`|ciXSjbCiaa	It means to spread.

This is how cancers invade other parts of the body, and they metastasize through the lymphatic system and/or blood stream.

Some people are going to be happiest with fast weight loss and individual counseling like you get with Quick Weight Loss Centers, and some people are going to be happier with slower weight loss in a group setting from a place like Weight Watchers.

That way, the sexual tension builds up and when you finally get to do it, it feels amazing. I know that it works for me =]|`|b8mr4frGaa	maybe your doing it too much? that's my only guess.

A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.
qnD5RfbPaa	I am not sure what your son's diet is like, however from your question I am made to believe that he does not eat a lot of fresh raw fruits and fresh raw vegetables.  These are very important for the boosting of the immune system.  Give him a very wide variety or fresh raw fruits and fresh raw vegetables to eat.  Give him in salads as well as drink.  Make sure to include foods that are rich in all B vitamins.  These are mainly all kinds of nuts and seeds, eggs, cheese, milk, spinach, yogurt, broccoli, brusels sprouts, sea fish, legume, watercress, mushrooms, liver, carrot, potatoes, tomatoes, beef liver, pepper mint, avocado, banana, beans, blackstrap molasses, cabbage, cantaloupe, corn and plantains.  You may use raw egg to make punch and give to him.<br>  <br>  He should also be given foods rich in vitamin C.  Some of these foods are all kinds of citrus (oranges, tangerines, lemon, lime, grapefruits, etc.), pineapple, mangoes, all berries (strawberries, blackberries, raspberries etc.), asparagus, papayas, radishes, all green leafy vegetables, collard, onions, sweet pepper, spinach and watercress.<br>  <br>  He should also be given foods rich in vitamin E.  These includes nuts, green leafy vegetables, egg, milk, sweet potatoes, legumes and seeds.<br>  <br>  You should specially ensure that his diet includes a lot of pineapple sweet pepper and papaya.  If he is able to tolerate hot pepper, a little of that would be good.  You may give him 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water or vegetable juice each day.  Or you may add honey to the water and vinegar to improve its taste.<br>  <br>  Ensure that he eats mostly vegetables and fruits each day.  at least 70% of his diet should be of fresh raw fruits and vegetables.  The other 30% should be mainly of carbohydrates from whole foods along with meats and other sources of proteins (nuts, seeds, grains etc) and cooked vegetables.  It is not a good thing to strip all the fats from meats.  These fats are necessary for the production of cholesterol, which is in turn important for the production of hormones, metabolism, mental and other important body functions. <br>  <br>  Boosting his immune system is the best way to keep him healthy at all times.<br>  <br>  If there are any details that you need, feel free to e-mail your request.<br>  <br>  Some additional information: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlKQSlwtOFoVLPBl5HkciILsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090125184153AAtkS9P">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>   <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmQRHj4dwdoX284FSf2ViY_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306185707AAFRSLk">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsYt7UzkSMDQ4YEMXkEXcnvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226172826AAiumXr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
9bLAXkcyaa	I feel your pain and only wish to repair the damage done without the use of a doctor.  First, the source of acne can be found right were you lay.  Make sure your pillow cases aren't covered in sweat, make-up, and grease from your face at night.  Washing those at lease once a week will start the clearing up process.  Speaking of washing, you'll need to wash your face with a unscented and color-less soap twice a day.  Finally, in order to work from the inside out you'll need to go to your local vitamin shop and pick up vitamin B-5.  It's also called pantothenic acid, it increases a source in your body that is overly used up during puberity.  Unfortunitly, that's the same vitamin your body uses to burn off excess oils produced on a regular basis.  Hope, this is helpful...

If you have the type of parents that are in your face or even see you they will know at least something is up.<br>  Unfortunately my Mom didn't care. So I was a drug addict from the time I was 11 till I turned to shooting heroin for 14 years along with being in and out of prison. It is fun at first, I will not lie...but you have to ask yourself if it is all worth it. When you like something that is dangerous for you, that can turn into ALOT of trouble and a very difficult life. Be carefull,  I promise I am not lying to you, it definitely messed me up in the head to this day. If I could do it all over I would steer clear of at least the heavier stuff.

xYTagSIyaa	Apparently it can affect the lungs, ears, brain and a few other area's, it is very rare for any of these things to happen and if they happen, it is even rarer for more than one secondary infection to take place and these secondary places would be complications of the chicken pox not the chicken pox itself.<br>  <br>  I did not read anywhere about chicken pox primarily or secondarily affecting the kidney or bladder, so I doubt that your kidney and bladder infection has anything to do with the chicken pox. <br>  <br>  The chicken pox can cause the shingles if your body gets run down, but I don't think it would effect it in any other way.<br>  <br>  It can effect the brain with meningitis which has nothing to do with ADD.<br>  <br>  I just want to say a bladder infection is a serious matter and needs antibiotics from a doctor to effect a total cure, so it does not lead to kidney damage, so please go see a doctor about this, if you have any symptoms of a bladder infection.<br>  <br>  nurse
LP1vTJCFaa	Your in laws became carriers through random chance of abnormal genes passed on through their genetics. It is absolutely nothing that they physically did. It is a rare genetic disorder and therefore passes through families. Do you brother and sister in law have the disease or are they carriers as well? Since your in laws are only carriers, they should not express the disease, but since two carriers happened to find each and have children, their children have a chance of either being fine, being a carrier, or having the disease. Again, it is rare, which is why you probably do not know of anyone else with the disease. Someone can be a carrier, but unless they have children with another carrier and produce a child with the genetic disposition for the disease, they may never know that they are a carrier. It is a strange twist of luck that both of your in laws carried the abnormal gene.

It took me about a week and a half to see real results. Since I burn 750/2=375 calories if used for 30 minutes, however the only way you'll be able to obtain fast results like myself would be to manage your calorie intake a little better to match the calories you are burning. Remember it takes 3,500 calories to burn 1 single pound. During your normal activities like sleeping, walking, even sitting you are constantly burning calories but most people usually consume more than they burn because of their bad eating habits. So if you kept your consumption to about 1,200 calories per day and ran for 30 minutes using the elliptical machine then you would probably see results in the same amount of time as myself.

OaxhMKr5aa	im 19 and it's taken a huge toll on my body already.........|`|ParFJxnSaa	Very early, depending on your constitution. Stress treatments appear in section 42 at ezy build, below. A certain level of stress is unavoidable, in modern society, so it is a good idea to develop effective coping methods. Light to moderate daily exercise helps fight stress. For some people, it helps to visualise a quiet, relaxing scene (imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ). <br>  <br>  You may wish to consider the following options: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat...</a>  & <a href="http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio.asp?f=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio...</a> & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditation-content/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditat...</a> & <a href="http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hypnosistreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hyp...</a>  Relaxation Hypnosis  & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/stress-buster/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/stress-buste...</a> Consumption of 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily; (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or its FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. The supplement DHEA is thought to counter the stress hormone, Cortisol. Ginseng & Lady's Slipper are recommended herbal remedies: see section 55, at ezy build, below. Practice daily, of one of the relaxation techniques in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time. Also: <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/stress/Relaxati..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mindtools.com/stress/Relaxati...</a> & <a href="http://relaxationemporium.com/" rel="nofollow">http://relaxationemporium.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/m..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/m...</a> & <a href="http://tinyurl.com/29so4u" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/29so4u</a> & at www.lessons4living.com/ there is an audio demonstration.

Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o refer. "Even though I sometimes suffer from stress, I deeply and completely accept myself". A variant of EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, insomnia, and anxiety, is shown in section 42, on page i, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is well worthwhile. You can also multitask, using the gazing technique, as you walk/jog or exercise, by focusing on a distant object, or just focus awareness on how each step feels, noting any thoughts which flash across your mind, without pursuing any particular train of thought, just gently redirect your focus to the task at hand.

With patellar tendon grafts, these tendons are fairly strong and ability to progress in therapy is rather quick...however, regaining full strength of the quads is very difficult. With a cadaver graft, regaining strength is not as much of an issue as protecting the graft from failing in the initial post-operative recovery period.  For hamstring grafts, regaining strength is not as much of an issue, but this graft tends to be a little looser...good for those who are still growing or older adults who are not very active.  <br>  <br>  In all, he might be in PT anywhere between 3-6 months...and full potential recovery can take about a year.|`|0zrwOWeGaa	I have not experienced this personally, but my father has. He tore his ACL a couple of years ago. He took a year to fully recover from the surgery. For a few weeks he couldn't do anything but lie on the couch. It was really rough on him but it's what you have to do, you know?<br>  <br>  I hope your boyfriend makes a full recovery and that the process isn't too hard on him. <br>  <br>  Best of luck  :)
Dmaahsc3aa	I have never had total knee replacement but a friend of mine did. . . this may sound stupid, but about 2 months after surgery she experienced odd pains and it came from an infection in the joint........but what caused it was actually started in her mouth !!!   she developed a gum infection, and it spread to the knee joint !!!  I told her that is what she gets for chewing on her leg !  LOL  LOL  Could you have an infection anywhere else in your body ? ?   For some reason it settles in that newly operated on knee!  Antibiotics took care of it 1-2-3 !!! Her doctor told her odd things like that do happen !!!   I hope yours isn't causing too much pain, and I hope it gets better soon. . .|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	It might be spasms from the nerves or side effects of the medicine! I hope it stops soon for you!|`|TCehI17kaa	I'm so sorry u are going through this. U should go to your Doctor & see what is causing your problem.  Hope u get better very soon|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	I never had a knee replacement but I do know that there are a lot of ligaments and nerves that take a long time to heal completely and in the process do cause pains.

You can get over 15-20% off if you get a dental plan which is something like $100 for the year and get an appointment with a real dentist. They negotiate lower rates with dentists and orthodontists.

If you still are nodding off, consider reviewing any medications you are on (if any) with your pharmacist or doctor to see if drowsiness is a side effect.  <br>  <br>  get some sleep!! :)|`|TgssIRr4aa	It could be a simple problem solver like making sure you get a full 7-8 hours of sleep, new documentation proves the body is need of that amount of sleep everyday, shut off the TV, computer Ipod, blackberry and go to bed!<br>  Or, you could have something called narcolepsy...something you should tell your dr. about....|`|vMi2KuHgaa	Go to sleep, you'll feel better and not so worried.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	If you haven’t had a sex education class then you aren’t missing much, sex education in schools is very poor and often full of misinformation, so it’s important for everyone to study sexual health for themselves, even if they’ve had sex education classes. For you I’d recommend checking out Scarleteen <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.scarleteen.com</a> which is a sex education site aimed at teens, but it’s not patronising, the information is accurate and it’s very body-positive, seriously check it out as it’s a great site. <br>  <br>  1. A Divacup is a brand of menstrual cup, it is a bell-shaped cup made of silicone that you insert into your vagina to catch menstrual flow. Cups are folded, inserted and you twist to create a light seal, to remove simply squeeze the bottom and pull out. Cups can be worn for up to 12 hours without leaking, including before your period, during the night, for sports including swimming, and from light to heavy flow. They are an ‘alternative’ to tampons because they are far cleaner and safer than tampons, they are also more convenient, reliable, comfortable, cheaper, greener and easier to use. You can find information on the Divacup web site <a href="http://www.divaucp.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.divaucp.com</a> on the Lunapads web site under ‘Divacup’ <a href="http://www.lunapads.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lunapads.com</a> and on Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_c...</a> <br>  <br>  2. Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is a potentially deadly illness that can affect anyone but most common in menstruating young women using tampons, TSS is also far more common the younger you are. It's caused when the common bacteria staphylococcus aureus start to produce TSS-toxin1 that gets into your bloodstream and attacks your body. TSS is rare but not as rare as people make-out – also contrary to popular belief TSS can happen from as soon as you use a tampon, not just from leaving tampons in too long. Initial symptoms are fever, sore throat, headache, aching, vomiting, diarrhoea, red eyes, skin flaking around hands and feet and low blood pressure. Symptoms begin after your period starts, and you may not get all symptoms, the serious phase lasts 4-5 days and it can kill within a week. TSS is linked to tampons due to synthetics used in the 80's that weren't safety tested, many women died but manufacturers ignored the problem, continuing to promote the tampons until they were banned years later. Since then other harmful ingredients have been used, but as manufacturers are self-regulated and there are no independent safety tests so little is done. Even without harmful ingredients TSS is still a risk along with many other health problems due to vaginal damage caused by tampon use. TSS is totally avoidable by using pads or cups instead of tampons, if you do use tampons use organic, lowest absorbency, change ever 4-6 hours, only use with heavy flow, don’t sleep with tampons in, alternate between tampons and pads. See toxic shock syndrome site <a href="http://www.toxicshock.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.toxicshock.com</a> and Tampon alert <br>  <a href="http://www.tamponalert.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.tamponalert.org.uk</a> <br>  <br>  3. Hymens have nothing to do with virginity, to loose your virginity you would have to have sex with another person. The hymen is a thin layer of tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina, it's normally around one-twentieth to one-tenth of an inch thick, different girls have different hymens and some don't have hymens. The hymen breaks or stretches with penetration, from sex, masturbation, using internal menstrual products, or some women's hymens don't fully break until they give birth – hymen breaking can be painful but is just as likely to be pleasurable. It’s just a little bit of flesh, there’s nothing connecting it to sex or whether you’re a virgin or not. <br>  <br>  4. Hun, I will say that tampons should be avoided by all women because of their health risks and because they are unhygienic, with so many other better options available tampons are far from the best option. Tampons prevent your vagina cleaning itself, they give bacteria the perfect place to multiply, they dry out the vagina causing ulceration in vaginal walls, they leave fibres within the vagina, and commercial brands contain ingredients that can cause increased bacterial growth. Tampons cause around 70% of all TSS cases, they cause around 80% of vaginal infections, and they are known to increase menstrual cramps and menstrual flow, tampons have also been linked to illnesses such as cancer and endometriosis. For young women like yourself the risks are worse because your vaginal walls are more delicate so more prone to damage, and your immune system isn’t as strong as in an adult. See tampon health sites <a href="http://www.spotsite.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.spotsite.org</a> and <a href="http://www.frontiernet.net/%7Eruthb/Tampons.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.frontiernet.net/%7Eruthb/Tamp...</a> We have a few sayings within sexual health – ‘friend’s don’t let friends use tampons’ ‘Axe Tampax!’ – there are really many reasons to avoid tampons, try menstrual cups as these are far safer and far better for things like gymnastics as they are more discrete, don’t leak and are more comfortable. <br>  <br>  To insert a tampon look at instructions in the pack and make sure you know where to insert. Use organic tampons like Cottons which are softer so more comfortable to insert, also non-applicator tampons are simpler, plus it's one less thing to bin. First wash hands, also do this after. Wait until a heavy day and use the lowest absorbency, get into a comfortable position, unwrap the tampon and pull the string so it hangs freely. Hold the tampon in one hand and with the other hand hold your labia open out of the way of your vaginal opening, then insert the tampon as far as it will go, aim towards the small of your back. Don't be scared to put your fingers into your vagina, it's yours, it's clean and menstrual blood is clean, if you're tense your vagina will tense so relax. If you have problems try masturbating as when aroused your vagina doubles in size, becomes relaxed and lubricated, or use lubrication such as KY jelly or olive oil to make insertion easier. If you feel pain as you move after insertion it's not in far enough so remove and try again with a fresh tampon later. To remove get comfortable, relax and pull strings gently but firmly, if you can't find the strings or are using cloth, sponge or soft tampons just grab the tampon itself to remove. A tampon can never get lost inside you, but if you can't remove them you need to ask someone for help or go to hospital. Tampons aren't flushable so wrap up and bin. You need to follow certain precautions to lessen health risks; change every 4-6 hours, always use the lowest absorbency making sure to change as your flow changes, never use when your flow is light, before your period or when you go to bed. You need to alternate between tampons and pads, pads are also needed as back-up, try Lunapads which are far more comfortable than pads you may be used to.|`|AA11553245	1) its a silicone cup that catches the menstual flow.<br>  2) it causes seizures, and it can be deadly. But it's nothing to worry about, especially if you use Tampax, and if you change your tampons regularly.<br>  3) yes you are still a virgin if you break your hymen with a tampon.<br>  4) I'm a gymnast too, i've actually never used pads, but I can imagine it would be a pain to use them while tumbling and wearing a leo.|`|D8qTbPdraa	1. I don't know.<br>  2. You get it if you leave your tampon in too long, apparently, but it's actually very rare, I think. Just change it every few hours to be safe, but I don't think it's going to be a problem to leave it in longer.<br>  3. Yes, you still are.<br>  4. I suggest asking your mother or sister or doctor or female friend.|`|ThvZUhKQaa	<a href="http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/tampon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/tampon....</a><br>  should help, google should help too|`|2uOhDMKjaa	1. I have no idea what a diva cup is... :S<br>  2. TSS (toxic shock syndrome) Basically read the side of a tampon box and ALL the info is there.<br>  3. No, you have to have sex to loose your virginity<br>  4. Tampons will work great for sports. I learned how to use them by reading the tampon box and the slip inside. They are very detailed, and helped me out. I would suggest getting a box of tampons and reading all the info on it... thats what i would do if you dont feel comfortable asking someone.<br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  P.S. we dont have a sex ed class at our school either.. so i feel for you. Thats all we learn about too.|`|AA12198742	In addition to the other items already mentioned, I would suggest starting out with a tampon that has a plastic applicator (they're smoother and usually go in easier) and also a "lite" or "junior" absorbancy.  Those are smaller/thinner and are better to start with if you're nervous. Once your period is more regular and predictable, you can change to tampons for heavier flow. (they will be slightly larger, though you don't feel them once they're in...). You might want to get a box with several different absorbancies to cover heavier or lighter flow days. Also, the thin thin liners make good "backup" to wear with a tampon and are not nearly as diaper like as pads. :-) <br>  <br>  Good luck

Feel better!!|`|7pxJdyRcaa	You would not necessarily have white spots on your tonsils early in the process of "Strep"  Go see your Medical Professional as a simple and fast  test can determine if you have Strep and the sooner you take antibiotics the sooner you will be over it.|`|gOuLO7zlaa	It sound like strep throat,go see a doctor,complications from that if you don't get the right meds is rheumatic fever|`|gcs54mvUaa	sounds like strep to me. you need antibiotics

FgPZ8Sl8aa	This isn't possible due to the way THC metabolizes in your system.<br>  <br>  I've heard of a few new marijuana smokers who experience this. I credit this to the fact that some effects we feel while high can occur naturally (ever heard of a "natural high").<br>  <br>  First off, we have endorphins which are released when we are high, and after the first time you get high you might start to associate normal pleasure associated with endorphin release to being high.<br>  <br>  Second, our body naturally releases some cannabinoids via the endocannabinoid system and, again, I think this has to do with associating natural occurring events in our bodies with marijuana use|`|aVY52WDgaa	The beginnings of a POTHEAD....|`|4JjJtcWgaa	not normal.

But even that goes away with a one week cleansing period and some physical activity.|`|AyaBvAOsaa	it can happen, but not normally<br>  it usually only happens if you eat it<br>  because if you eat it, it gets absorbed into your blood stream <br>  then the next time you eat a meal it will push it further through your digestive system and get you high all over again<br>  <br>  but if you just smoke it <br>  it shouldn't do that
464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	I am not a doctor, I found this information for you at medical websites.If you are concerned about this situation with your blood pressure you need to see a doctor. <br>  <br>  In most of the cases, causes of high blood pressure are unknown.A single elevated blood pressure reading in the doctor's office or at home can be misleading because the elevation may be only temporary.It may be caused by anxiety about something in your life. A single episode of isolated systolic hypertension can be due to  smoking or being exposed to second-hand smoke and drinking alcohol, or because you have an increased sugar level in your body.The actual mechanisms which explain why the blood pressure is high has to do mainly with the constriction of the small arterioles which are in all of the tissues of the body. When these are even slightly smaller than normal, the overall effect is that of a marked decrease in the volume that blood can flow in.<br>  <br>   Did you eat something from a fast food eating establishment today? According to one medical website I was at. this could cause your blood pressure to rise.<br>  <br>  Basically, there are two types of high blood pressure. First, where causes are unknown, affecting almost 95 % of high blood pressure patients and called primary hypertension. Second, where causes are known, affecting almost 5-6 % of high blood pressure patients and called secondary hypertension.<br>  <br>  Some general causes of primary hypertension are due to family history, obesity, low levels of Nitric Oxide and diabetes. Whereas,<br>  secondary hypertension is mainly due to various medical conditions like kidney diseases.<br>  <br>  I hope this information is useful to you, however you might get some comfort by calling your local hospital and asking a trained professional there what possible reasons there could be for this happening to you. Best wishes to you!|`|ciXSjbCiaa	Its really hard to tell. What is the number? Are you taking meds for hypertension? If it is very high I would definitely go to the ER if I were you just to be safe.|`|xYTagSIyaa	First a normal blood pressure reading has two numbers a diastolic or lower number and a systolic or the higher reading.  A normal blood pressure is 120/80 in an adult.   If your systolic blood pressure was 80 <br>  then that would be quite low in an adult.  While 149 would represent a medium high reading that would not necessarily require medication.  If you take your blood pressure and find you have a very different than normal reading you should suspect the machine is not working or that you were temporarily excited by exercising or a scare or a noise etc.  That is why you need several readings to have a diagnosis of high blood pressure, and before the doctor will put you on medicine.<br>  <br>  It happens sometimes with diet, that your blood pressure will go up.  You said you did not have caffeine.  Caffeine can be found in tea's even green tea and chocolate and coke and pepsi and some vitamins and weight loss medications.  You may have taken in more salt then usual which can also put your blood pressure up.  Did you eat any soy sauce or chips or deli meats and even pop and mineral waters can have a lot of salt in them.<br>  <br>  Some vegetables can be high in salt as well as some salad dressings.  <br>  <br>  If you have an allergy to a food it can increase your blood pressure and sometimes fighting an infection like the flu could possibly increase your temperature and pulse and blood pressure.  Emotional factors can play a part in increasing the blood pressure as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would take my blood pressure again tomorrow and see if it is normal, before I push any panic buttons.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
5i4vUQhgaa	i have lived with cronic ear infections all my life and have had tubes in my ears 13 times, actually the ear drops are not an antibiotic thier for numbing the ear until the infection is gone. you need to ask the doc for keflex or another alternative. some times you have to out way the odds on some meds, like diarhea or an infection you can clear the infection and then worry about the diarhea.|`|Zwpagpubaa	I have been having the same problem.  I was asking around and got a CRAZY answer to my problem.  One person told me to put urine in my ear.  She said it cures ear infections.  I thought she was CRAZYYYYYYYY!  I googled it.  It turns out people do this.?.?.  Who would have thought that one?  I haven't tried it (yet).  If I get desperate enough...I might just give it a try...LOL.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|NhF9sM5jaa	get the doctor to give him prescription ear drops instead<br>  <br>  it tingles a little bit (from the cold) as the drop goes in so he might flinch, but it is much safer for a child than long term use of amoxicillin<br>  <br>  good luck!
4UV5423Qaa	smoking is more expensive. plus it ***** you up hardcore.its harmful effects are mostly irreversible and at best takes your lungs at least a year and a half to heal and never all the way.<br>  <br>  hypothetical situation:suppose you are addicted to eating and being so made you  morbidly obese. you finally decide to do something about it. you control your appetite. you lose a hundred pounds. eventually, youre in athletic shape. in the end, the addiction made you a better person because you overcame your addiction, learned some discipline and perseverance, therefore boosting your fragile ego, and could now even eat more because you adopted a high energy lifestlye.(best case scenario)<br>  <br>  personally i eat 2500 calories a day to maintain my weight because i lift and run 6 days a week.i fast on the seventh day.<br>  <br>  but really neither is good.i used to LOVE cigarettes.i cringe when i see one now.|`|61Fwbi79aa	I have been extremely overweight. (The medical report called it "morbidly obese") I had gastric bypass and lost 200 pounds. After that I took to smoking, os I basically have been in both camps. as far as health goes, I cant decide which is worse for a person. Both are horrible, and I was not able to kick overeating without a drastic medical procedure. I am trying to quit smoking, because my feonce has told me that it is a dealbreaker, and I would rather have her than a cigarette, but it is still very hard to quit.<br>  <br>  I have residual health issues from the years of being obese.

Also overeating has more motivation to change then smoking because you get fat and people judge you and give you looks which makes you want to change so that people won't look down there nose at you.<br>  <br>   physical appearance is a pretty big motivator and smoking doesn't change your appearance that dramatically.<br>  <br>  Overeating would also taste better :)|`|3e0fb112d935519e50f071750d581bcdaa	Man  -  I'm screwed. <br>  I smoke<br>  AND<br>  occasionally overeat.<br>  <br>  I suppose I'd rather just overeat though - I can lose the weight if it ever gets to be a problem.

B359bLqsaa	I understand what you are talking about.  I dont have a rape fantasy per se, but I do have a desire to be taken sexually against my will but not by a dangerous stranger who may kill me.  I would like it more from a trusted person like my husband who is being dominate over me.  There's something safe about the feeling of being submissive to a dominate person.  I understand also how it relates back to being sexually abused as a child because you had no choice but be submissive.  I think it will be ok as long as you can talk openly with your partner and its done out of love and you are perfectly safe at all times.<br>  <br>  I also think you need to seek professional help for the abuse you experienced as a child.  Its OK to have fantasies, but if you want absolutely every sexual experience to be like a rape then its not healthy,  you will just be reliving the abuse.  Hopefully the person who abused you has been held accountable for his actions.  Nobody should hurt a child.  I'm sorry that happened to you,,,, really sorry.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I'm so sorry that you were abused.  No doubt this plays a huge part in your fantasy.

That way I know the hairs won't get too short to the point of irritation. I don't get that itchy regrowth stubble either. If you want it all gone I'd suggest laser hair removal.<br>  Shaving just causes more problems for me and it sounds like it does for you too.|`|f30d8af191e3f75b76ad08ab74b32fecaa	1) Make sure you have a nice fresh razor blade<br>  2) Get some good shaving cream.

Trying using a lighter touch. Is your skin irritated because of the acne? Try getting some acne wipes. Clearasil works pretty good but beware it has alcohol in it which will bleach your eyebrows if you aren't careful. I use these Neutrogena pads that are a little more expensive but work good for moderate skin issues. Try using some normal lotion that does grease up your skin but still keeps it moisturized.

d3VV4b6vaa	not just in Chinese Medicine, but in all of holistic practices, this affects the whole body. when even just one organ is not functioning properly, the entire body reacts. the kidneys represent courage, so when there is excess fear or shock, its very harmful to the kidneys. and when there are cysts (or blockages) symptoms can be as such: fatigue, hair loss, lower back pain, ringing in the ears (ears and kidneys are closely related) dizziness, short of breath, frequent urination, impotence in men and infertility in women, and cold sensations. and its also believed excessive sex is harmful to the kidneys, especially when there is a blockage in them.|`|0494d957cdc898138da2648f6185a57eaa	I was told by my Doctor several years ago that i had cysts on my Kidneys but i have'nt cheked on wheather if something be done about them because they dont bother me
de6c6d24d6131f2475530ef0e29d7442aa	There are some general measures to allergy relief beside medicine, first the environment; avoid at all cost tobacco smoke, avoid known allergens: for pollen you can use air conditioners and air  filters, clean more often and avoid outdoor activities, For dust mites avoid humidifiers, carpeting or rugs, teddy bears, vacuuming more often helps, wash linen with hot water cycle and dry it with sun light. At the end the combination of all these measures could help. Of course you should have an allergist or pediatrician that would identify if your son also needs inhaled therapy (such as albuterol and inhaled corticosteroids) even systemic corticosteroids. My mom used to give me nasal washes with salt water and chamomile, there are plenty of commercial products such as sterilized sea water that could help in the worst days, also drinking a lot of liquid helps to clear the mucus... I hope to be of some help and that  you all have a better day tomorrow

If they are doing a stomach exam, they will cover everything up except the stomach.  If they are doing a pelvic exam, they will keep everything draped except the pelvic area.  <br>  <br>  This way they are keep your modesty in tact by only exposing the parts that are needed.  <br>  <br>  In addition, they don't want to see your underwear, bra, etc.  It's easier if that stuff is nicely folded in the corner.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	cuz its AWKWARD stripping infront of your doctor, its not for their sake its for the patients sake... i dont care if hteyre gonna c me naked i would rather have the leave the room---|`|2AAo6Xr7aa	Maybe because some patients fear that the doctors are gonna judge them with the way they change and stuff.|`|aXm6wS8paa	so they don't see you changing????<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and its just award!!!|`|6b7UXPUQaa	Mostly it's to make you feel more comfortable.

0TGpz08paa	I am now 22 but when I was a teenager , I would cut myself. I would cut myself on my stomach and my arms. I saw a therapist about how I dealt with my life and about my cutting and it helped a lot. Sometimes just talking to someone helps a lot. You need to find someone you can confide in. Maybe try and talk to a school nurse or the school councelor and let someone know what is going on. If you don't tell anyone, they won't be able to help you. So reach out for help and you'll feel better soon|`|1jS20kGdaa	You sound just like what i'm going through. First step distract yourself as soon as u feel the urge to cut do something else. If you need to talk to someone my email is winterluver94@yahoo.com. If you don't stop you will just keep getting deeper everytime you cut. You need to stop because in a split second your life can turn from crappy to hell.|`|R06Y4ixyaa	This is really not a forum that can help you with this problem.  You really need to talk to an adult that you can trust and who can help you.  If not a parent, then maybe a teacher, or someone at school.

TC21ao0Paa	CT Scans can increase your exposure to the harmful effects of radiation. CT Scans emit more radiation than an x-ray. If a person has been exposed frequently to radiation, then the possibility of burns is increased. This would explain why Oncologists' try to reduce the number of CT Scans that are performed.<br>  In addition, if a MRI is performed, any metal or scrapnel can irritate the skin causing a burn-like injury or, worse. The magnetic pull is quite strong from a MRI exam. It can cause significant injury to people should any type of metal be in close proximity of the exam site.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps.

By taking synthetic vitamins we can make our bodies "lazy" about absorbing the vitamins from our food since the pills are more easily absorbed.<br>  <br>  Instead of popping the pills when you're anxious, try eating an orange or drinking some fresh juice. You'll get your vitamin C in a more natural form and other minerals and good stuff besides.<br>  <br>  Also you could try chamomile or linden (limeblossom) tea, they are very calming.|`|0zrwOWeGaa	Not really.

VwDIeYteaa	We have the same problem and I want abs too! Sorry this is no help whatsoever.|`|JGrpDLKcaa	Age does play a factor in building muscle, as you will grow into any body you have when you're young. That being said, it's never a bad time to get fit, and look good. To get 'six-pack abs' you need to do two things: lose weight and build muscle. If you're already skinny, then there really isn't much fat burning to do. That being said, if you are underweight, you might try eating more. A healthy diet, with plenty of protein will do wonders. Be sure to even that out with a good cardio workout (running, biking, or even walking). Any muscle you attain won't be visible though a layer of fat.<br>  <br>  As for the muscle itself, situps and crunches are good. You wont see change in a matter of days, but change always comes with time. Start out small and work your way up. In no time you'll be able to rock a few hundred every day. If you want to step it up, remember that anything that decreases stability will increase how hard the muscles work. An exercise ball is a great way to do this. Also, as with working out any muscle, stepping up the weight will step up the process.<br>  <br>  Situps, crunches, abdominal twists, standing side bends are some good ones. Don't rush, and hold the exercise for a few seconds each time. If you're looking to do something while stuck somewhere, just tense the muscle. Hold it for a few and release.|`|AA11144162	I think.<br>  <br>  My gym teacher says if it burns its working. <br>  <br>  <br>  So make sure it burns.<br>  :]

pvYy6iTSaa	tyson -  Smallpox is caused by a "pox" group virus.  It is a deadly disease which has been eradicated over 30 years on earth without a single new human infection.  A sort of "relative" pox virus causes "cow pox" in cattle = a much more benign virus which is used to make the hiuman vaccine against smallpox infection.  Another pox virus you have likely heard of is chickenpox = a more benign disease, usually of childhood.  In older people who have had chickenpox, there is an increased chance of getting another related skin and nerve disorder called "shingles" = a benign but painful condition.

AA12198742	from the context of your question my best explanation is that L5 is one of the vertebrae in your lower back (L=lumbar, T=thorassic, C=cervical).  From the pain you mention, the L5 thing makes sense, as well as slippage as the vertebrae above and below 5 are smaller or "normal" sized.

UwERUBvZaa	Dear Lillianne,<br>  <br>  If your dad has been doing this for as long as you can remember, but you're clearly noticing an increase in the frequency and/or duration of his "self-talk", it might be time to investigate a little further.<br>  <br>  Some people, myself included, talk to themselves from time to time in order to better focus on a task they are involved in. Other times, it's a behavior that seems to come out when one is trying to resolve a particular thought process, e.g.,"I don't know why she says I'm always late for dinner", etc. I have noticed that amongst people I've known who are especially isolated, emotionally and/or physically, this  kind of self talk seems to be more prominent.<br>  <br>  I guess where I would draw the line between idiosyncrasy and possible signs of illness, might be that when some one is talking to themself, are they still aware of their surroundings? Are they present and cognizant of the interactions of other persons in their presence? Is the content of their self-talk rational and/or does it lead to some kind of conclusion?<br>  <br>  Although there are probably many benign reasons for this behavior, it could potentially be a symptom of illness. The DSM-IV lists several mental illnesses that have "constant self vocalization" as one primary symptom.(the DSM-IV is a diagnostic manual used by mental-health professionals)<br>  <br>  Talk with your dad about this, if you can, in a gentle manner. Also, other family members or friends. I know it's kind of scary to address this kind of stuff, especially with those we love, but if it is something serious it is in their best interests, and yours, to find out they are in need of medical care.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your dad, Lillianne,<br>  <br>  Edward|`|AA11820571	Maybe he's just lonely.

2GaJFMqQaa	Anytime you add cardio that raises your heartbeat for more than 20 minutes on a regular basis your body will burn more energy and not just when you are doing the exercise. If you haven't been in the habit of exercising, every other day is a good routine to follow because it's doable and you won't feel badly if you miss a day, which is likely because, well, there's life.

lJZuyoaaaa	Ima softball player myself so this is what couldve happened. You couldve pulled a muscle. If you did that, then it will take about 3-4 days untill it gets healed. Until then, dont run on it or youll just pull it some more. I doubt you broke it unless you jumped really hard onto the floor. But if you broke it, you wouldnt be able to walk. Another thing that may have happened was that you probably just bruised it. Alot of pressure to the leg when sliding is like getting punched in the arm and getting black and blue bruses. If your leg gets black and blue, then its just bruised. Itll take time before that gets healed also. If it doesnt, then you just pulled a muscle.|`|AaoclPYCaa	You could of broken it or torn something.  You might have just bruised it.  You need to get to the doctor and get an xray.

cXQmtN1Saa	I'm in a phonebooth making a call late at night and a sexy stranger slides the door open, pulls the phone outta my hand and leaves it hanging (so the person on the other line can hear everything thats about to happen), pushes me up against a wall and makes out with me while pinning my hands above my head.

RXI8ImdIaa	You're cold. Blood vessels in the non-life-supporting extremities constrict, limiting the blood flow to those areas and thereby conserving your body heat for your more vital organs in the center of your body.<br>  <br>  If you keep losing heat, you will continue to get numb from the outside towards the inside - so starting with fingers and toes, and creeping up your limbs toward your trunk.<br>  <br>  It may seem counterintuitive, but in the future try making sure your head is covered and warm. You lose a lot of heat through your head, resulting in the other extremities losing blood flow faster.|`|B3Cd58ehaa	That must be spontanious|`|O5s0lpGyaa	Your penis and balls need blood.....WARM blood....<br>  So...Being an "ending" of the body, it needs to protect from cold...<br>  And the sperm needs like 38° to survive...<br>  So that′s why when men are cold...balls go all the way up...<br>  =P lol....

bPg8WmLqaa	When I think of alternative medicine I think of things that are not of the Western way of thinking.  Practice of Eastern Medicine takes into account the whole body not just the symptoms that Western Medicine looks at to cure the patient.<br>  <br>  Alternative medicine is also a way to avoid invasive techniques, like surgery.   But above all else try alternative ways, so many doctors these days are too quick to grab their Rx pad,  Some are on the dole of  the drug companies to Rx the latest drug as a form of a kickback.<br>  <br>  Alternative medicine may mean no medicine as in the Western view of thinking, but as I stated above Eastern view takes the whole body into account and how if treating one area how does it effect the rest of the body, not just the signs & symptoms being displayed.|`|LMoJl7hFaa	I think its a funny term, but that is what it is called.<br>  <br>  Drugs force the body to do what it normally wouldn't and mostly covers up symptoms doesn't handle the condtion.<br>  <br>  Herbs are similar in it gets the body to do what it normally wouldn't do.  However, it is not as toxic as a drug which is man made in a lab.<br>  <br>  Nutritional healing is giving the body the nutrients it needs to it can fix the problem and restore health.

ymolgHz5aa	No, she just gets neverous being infront of people. I am the same way. She must be extremely afraid of presenting things. Well, yes she is comfortable around her friends, because they are her friends, she may know the kids in your class but is probably not friens with them all. Do you understand?|`|WGos7RSMaa	I'm guessing she just gets very nervous about presenting in front of people.|`|1niMRNJ4aa	No, she probably just gets really nervous. Ask her about it and then if that is the case try and make her feel calm.

c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	2000 or more....|`|s0wBK9eYaa	I would recommend NOT counting calories. Eat until your 80% full and then stop. Your body will tell you how much it needs, you don't need a label to do that. Also you should be more concerned about eating foods with nutrient dense calories instead of empty calories. Focus more on eating quality foods instead of 100 calorie packs of junk.|`|LPxKxA6Taa	<a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/tools/calories-burned" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutritiondata.com/tools/calor...</a> <-- put your information in the chart and it will caculate exactly how many calories you need to burn.|`|RX4nj825aa	no more than like 25oo o something like that

OdxrtbF1aa	I have been answering this for myself all of my life.  Here is what works for me:  Regular aerobic exercise, especially walking or running outside.  Include some hands on activities in your life, fixing things, making things, biking, paddling a canoe, mowing, shoveling, etc.  Take 3 supplements: Fish oil, vitamin B compex, and L. Theanine.   Fish oil and vitamin B both help with stress and anxiety.  L. Theanine is less well known in the US but has been used in Japan for decades and is approved by their health ministry.  It is a natural  product extracted from green tea but has no caffeine.  (by the way be sure you have no caffeine in your diet as it definitely adds stress).  Look for SunTheanine on the label.  100mg is a reasonable dose.  It is not addictive and is known to promote relaxation and clear mind focus and stress reduction.  No euphoria, just lets you deal with things better and feel better.  The effect is subtle.  It can be purchased at Whole Foods and other health food stores.  It starts working in as little as 20 minutes and works 8 to 10 hours.  What works great for some, is to take one capsule late afternoon, like 4pm.  The evening is more relaxing, sleep is much improved and you feel better the next whole day.  You may require a larger dose or more frequent one.   PS.  I share your financial stress, but find the above routine very helpful.|`|QT0qTFyAaa	Exercise. It releases feel good, stress relieving chemicals in your body. Anti-depressants only work if you are depressed about nothing all the time. You have a reason to be stressed. Just please put things in perspective. We are in another depression, yes I said depression, not recession. Millions of people are hurting financially right now and that number will continue to grow. I lost my high-salary job of 9 years in January and can't even get an response from putting out resumes. I am taking some extra college classes now and doing some volunteer work to keep my mind straight. But working out 3-4 times a week has really helped me.|`|vrVVQgqwaa	you need a good support group, friends, a social group ect to hang out with this will help with the stress.  the bad habits, try replacement therapy, if you bite your nails, when you go to bite, pick up the polish instead and do them, do a positive item if you want to eat, do sit ups ect|`|XEvK4urxaa	i sent yo an email x|`|7DVWC3Z5aa	Do something that you enjoy doing.

For some people, it helps to visualise a quiet, relaxing scene (imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ). <br>  <br>  You may wish to consider the following options: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat...</a>  & <a href="http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio.asp?f=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio...</a> & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditation-content/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditat...</a> & <a href="http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hypnosistreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hyp...</a>  Relaxation Hypnosis  & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/stress-buster/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/stress-buste...</a> Consumption of 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily; (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or its FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. The supplement DHEA is thought to counter the stress hormone, Cortisol. Ginseng & Lady's Slipper are recommended herbal remedies: see section 55, at ezy build, below. Practice daily, of one of the relaxation techniques in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time. Also: <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/stress/Relaxati..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mindtools.com/stress/Relaxati...</a> & <a href="http://relaxationemporium.com/" rel="nofollow">http://relaxationemporium.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/m..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/m...</a> & <a href="http://tinyurl.com/29so4u" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/29so4u</a> & at <a href="http://www.lessons4living.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lessons4living.com/</a> there is an audio demonstration. At www.amazon.com/  there are: "sounds of the ocean", & "ambient rain sound", & "mountain river sounds" via the searchbar. <br>  <br>  You could repeat: "I feel calm" and/or "I can handle this." , or employ the EFT version for use in public, for which you can reasonably claim that you have a headache, as you massage/tap your temples, but it may be advisable to restrict yourself to subvocalising (saying it to yourself, in your mind, not aloud). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o refer. "Even though I sometimes suffer from stress, I deeply and completely accept myself". A variant of EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, insomnia, and anxiety, is shown in section 42, on page i, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is well worthwhile. You can also multitask, using the gazing technique, as you walk/jog or exercise, by focusing on a distant object, or just focus awareness on how each step feels, noting any thoughts which flash across your mind, without pursuing any particular train of thought, just gently redirect your focus to the task at hand.
M961DkIjaa	Wash your pillowcase.|`|LPxKxA6Taa	Wash your face with sugar before you go to bed but wash your makeup ALL off before yu do this. It really works!. keep doing this for about a couple days and you will see a difference. Stop touching your face too and looking at it and worrying about it. :). The more you worry about it, the more you THINK you'll see it :) dont worry hun it'll get better!|`|R2gV4qYwaa	thats called puberty. its just the point when your body is growing and maturing into its adult form, at this point your body is very sensitive and the oil that your face natually produces is causing breakouts. wash your face every day with clearisil or some other mild acne soap and use a foam sponge or something like that and take good care of your face. that should help|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	happens...<br>  <br>  corticosteroids will clean them up in 2 days. but you need a prescription for them.<br>  <br>  rubbing toothpaste on your face and letting it sit there for 10-15 mins will also work actually, it dries the oils out big time.|`|bvANHTbEaa	Really hot rag, then acne medication! The heat will open open up the pores and allow more medicine to get into them!!!|`|ZsEMqnwPaa	first of all dont touch them!!<br>  second...<br>  i suggest proactiv unless you have sensitive skin, tea tree oil by the body shop.<br>  they really work for me...
PzHHq6xcaa	Other than performing a right heart catheterization, the ways of calculating the RVSP using Doppler echocardiography are limited.<br>  <br>  In "normal" patients, one can measure the isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) using spectral Doppler, then apply that value to previously published empirical nomograms.<br>  <br>  In a patient with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), one can apply the following formula:<br>  <br>  RVSP = Systolic blood pressure (measured from a BP cuff) - 4*(velocity across the VSD during systole)^2<br>  <br>  In a patient with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)*, one can apply the following formula<br>  <br>  Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) = Systolic blood pressure (measured from a BP cuff) - 4*(velocity across the PDA)^2<br>  <br>  * in the above equation, one can assume PASP ~ RVSP.

I think you may have moderate OCD.|`|Cm7AsR26aa	yea maybe just a little. but everybody can be different for example i have to always have the light off in my room if im not in there. its just a habit and i always turn the light off even when someone else is in there. lol. i cant help it.

QT0qTFyAaa	Yes, you need the adrenaline rush though. I had a criminal spray me with a face full of pepper spray and I didn't even feel it until 20 minutes after the incident. Then I am chasing this a*shat and he is spraying me over the shoulder as he is running. After about 1/8th mile of chasing him the pepper spray was in my lungs and I couldn't run anymore. A fellow officer tackled him a short time later.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	Yes, yes there is.

BO28Mn8haa	I went through a serious hormonal jump between 7th and 8th grade. My boobs went from a B to a full C then eventually a D. I got a few light stretch marks from that but they eventually went away as my body filled out. <br>  <br>  Remember to wear good push up bras to keep your skin tight and your boobies perky|`|qLuodu3Raa	yes normal|`|3OcR5eFraa	Its very normal. It depends on how fast they've grown. you could be 13 with an A cup then 14 with a C cup then deff. because thats fast. but most girls have them even if their not bright red or pink, they can be white and not very noticable. but its very common dont worry.|`|nxMi4adjaa	if u gain or lose weight up there, it happens<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307190412AAErJ0y">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|mnkZ6VS9aa	Many girls have stretch marks on their breasts, and not necessarily because they're large.

AA10350894	Quit thinking about it! When you are with a girl, concentrate on pleasing her, not whether you are going to get hard or not! Once you shift your thinking to that, you'll get your erection AND a very pleased girl who will most like always come back for more!<br>  You'll find that there is nothing that's a bigger turn on then to be with a girl that is totally turned on based upon the pleasure you make her feel!|`|GvEsaVYeaa	It sounds like nervousness. Are you afraid that you won't perform well or that your penis is too small? Here is the thing to remember, everyone has their bad days, and as long as your penis is long enough to touch, it is large enough.|`|RMcHC7fnaa	you are most likely subconsciously afraid of getting an erection around other people, so your conscious mind has to over power that|`|nxMi4adjaa	maybe you are nervous or something, why do want to?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307190412AAErJ0y">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|h1omg1IPaa	try with guys?|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Bender is right. <br>  <br>  I'll add - stop making an issue of it in your mind. Don't think about whether or not you will be hard. Because you know what, if you're not hard it doesn't matter. You can do other things and totally enjoy yourself and give your girl a good time.<br>  <br>  Don't pressure yourself to perform. You don't have to have sex at all, you can do foreplay, be close and intimate, etc.<br>  <br>  If you shift the focus away from this 'problem' and make it not a problem, it will be solved. You'll get erections without trying.
C0OnjBySaa	Sounds like it. A cold tends to be only for a day and usually doesn't include aches and pains.  The flu can drag on for days but usually after a couple of days it's too late to treat, just have to rest.  Make sure you drink lots of water.<br>  Still always see a doctor for confirmation.|`|AA11833633	it does sound like the flu but when its a higher temp that usually means its a bacterial infection (not good!)...v.s non fever flu like which is just viral....neck muscles could be mennigitis...the non-bad one so don't worry...that goes away on itself.....but drink water or gatorade ..make sure you try to eat a little like soup..if this turns worse go to ER...but if its still the same on monday call doc
Xy4kHpteaa	Well smoking weed effects everyone differently but for most, it just calms you down a lot. You get really relaxed and don't usually feel up to doing much. You also get very giggly and can sometimes ramble on about the most insane ideas that sound, to you, like the most intelligent stuff in the world. Usually, at least for me, you remember what happened, things might be a bit hazy but you don't black out entirely, marijuana isn't powerful enough of a drug to do that unless it's laced with something or other. My best guess is that your friend was just acting out. She barely smoked anything and doesn't sound like she's ever really been high either because it sounds like she wasn't sure how to act<br>  <br>  Hope that helped|`|Cm7AsR26aa	not everyone reacts the same way to smoking weed. everyone reacts in a different way. like i tripped out. i couldnt see and i couldnt hear and i was losing it. well so it seemed. but you cant really know until you try it.|`|OHfcGAgIaa	I've never had lack of control, I might have acted differently and been a bit silly but never over the top. Majority of the time I have more self control and think more than I talk. I think you're friend is lying or weed doesn't agree with her brain.<br>  <br>  Errrrr no it doesn't depend on how your body reacts it depends on the strain (and the way it's grown) of weed you're smoking.|`|PK49Nodlaa	sometimes i just mellow out and enjoy the breeze..<br>  sometimes i get really nervous and agitated.<br>  it just depends sometimes your body reacts differently<br>  yes, you can control yourself, but you cant control your feelings.<br>  trust me - you have more control on weed than you do on alcohol|`|OSBGf8teaa	Your are stupid mate anyone who takes drugs are stupid, it messes up your life and harms people you love and some times results in death. stay away stay safe.|`|aA3NsOkNaa	If you smoke weed you should be calm and relaxed...you might laugh alot but unless it is laced with something you shouldn't get hyper.<br>  Odd I have never heard of it. Maybe she is an exception or maybe it was the combination. Some of it might have been that her inhibitions were gone and she was finally showing who she really is. Never know.<br>  <br>  I know that when I used to get high I was giggly and funny. I never got belligerent, and absolutely never lost control like that.<br>  Always remembered what happened. Though if the pot was laced you never know.<br>  <br>  Personally I think she is finally showing who she really is. <br>  Good luck with that though
d56a5ba2413d9b7acc86b0ab319339aeaa	So many things can cause numbness like loss of blood flow.a pinched nerve..stroke..heart attack..what worked for me was a good Chiropracter<br>  shop around also a good professional massage can do wonders. These are just suggestions that have helped me|`|ciXSjbCiaa	Its due to nerve impingement or disease affected the peripheral nervous system. You'd have to see a doctor to figure out what the source of the problem is but numbness is a problem that originates in the nerves.|`|YOFh92Fqaa	Why doesn't she go see a doctor? Also it's caused by sleeping or lying on a vein that prevents blood from circulating which makes you numb. Try telling her to take a cold shower to make the blood circulate.
V6LBG5KDaa	none of you people can qualify with any evidence how this girl is going to "turn out" also whats your definition of a screw up? In my opinion people on this planet can do what ever the heck they want and i despise these people think they have a right to tell other people how to live their lives who the **** are you to say? christ you make me so angry.......<br>  <br>  I think she should tell her mum that she knows what she's doing and depending how old she is tell her that she's old enough to make decisions for herself and that it wont get in the way of her achieving what she wants to achieve, sorry about the rant|`|vo6ZenTUaa	Your friend is not likely to get her mother to accept her smoking pot.  It is illegal and I'm sure her mother is worried about her health.  <br>  If she is a "total pot head" as you say then she is also an addict which means she needs help.|`|JBTUKQV7aa	your her friend, tell her she needs to stop. if she doesnt, **** the ***** you dont need her. shes going to be major screw up in life. my advice: find new friends|`|AA11256693	You friend is an addict and her mother has every right to be upset.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	ummm i dont think that'll work cause it is a drug and she's obviously bothered by it
vwGSTzHYaa	I had the same thing, stretch marks, I am your height.<br>  <br>  I talked to my doctor about it, and he said nothing really works on them. I am 15, around your age too. He told me that over time they will fade, and maybe even go away fully.<br>  <br>  All I can recommend to help them out a bit is bio oil, Shea butter, or a cream designed specially for stretch marks.|`|mdV0oXATaa	any extreme stretching of the skin can cause them, so yes growth could cause them, exspecially when you just shrunk your skin by losing weight, and the stretched it by growing, a fast change in a small amount of time|`|4OOcsiS7aa	It is weight gain/loss, puberty, growth, etc. Don't worry it's common and normal.
4N13iiFpaa	Hypnosis, if done by a properly motivated and trained professional like myself and many colleagues, can have absolutely no negative side effects. Therefore, there is no such thing as "too much hypnosis".<br>  <br>  If a hypnosis session is done by an untrained person, or by yourself, it is possible to create unintended anchors that may not be desired, like the connection of trance with a certain song. This could be extremely dangerous when you're driving or involved in other similar activities with the radio on.<br>  <br>  It is also possible to have an abreaction to a certain phrase or suggestion, which, while rare, is more likely after several hypnotic sessions.|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello<br>  <br>  It is a natural state, allergy free, you cannot overdose, so unless your using it to avoid reality you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|PJ74nbfsaa	considering that each one of us is in trance many times a day I doubt that it is bad for us.
6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	Go ahead and take it. He can't feel if he's releasing preejaculate, you are at risk.<br>  <br>  People ovulate at all times of the month. This month I ovulated 6 days after my period ended, and sperm lives inside for up to 5 days, so... it would have been possible for me to get pregnant if I had done what you did.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should consider BC pills? Then you don't have to worry about not having a condom. Plan B is hard on the system, if you're taking it fairly often, it will start to effect you. Talk to your doctor.
Nw6DbfCcaa	Yes, you have to really smoke if you want it to help you lose weight. It is simple, really - when you get hungry, smoke until you aren't hungry any more. You have to inhale the smoke, but the number of cigarettes you would need to smoke in a day is completely up to you.<br>  For most people, 1 cigarette every 30 minutes is plenty to keep you from getting hungry.|`|4JjJtcWgaa	cigs curb hunger and give a slight sensation of feeling full. so smoke more, eat less, lose weight. Simple as that. <br>  <br>  That said, as I'm sure you know, cigs are bad and I wouldnt recommend starting to anyone. I've been on a pack a day for a few years now and regret ever starting.
2GaJFMqQaa	I think it's a bit of most of the answers below. Even the smarty liposuction one. Not the healthiest way to go. It varies from person to person, body type to body type, and what you consider results. The greatest benefit you achieve is that you will start feeling better and likely begin to have a more positive body image in a couple of weeks. You may lose a couple of lbs quickly, as often people lose a lot of water weight at first. I suggest you have one or two people who will support you in these efforts and that you find out, preferably through an MD, what a healthy weight and weight loss plan is for you. Good luck!|`|y0pm4DJHaa	depends on how healthy and what your meaning of healthy is... like 2 foot long subs from subway isnt healthy... its healthy food but to much is not good... eat 6 small meals a day and do elliptical for longer than 30 minutes a day... but with yours it may be 3 to 4 weeks or so but like i said... all about your diet|`|77ee75e86d8e690597a2d6e31f287e9baa	Its gonna be about two weeks for the real results.<br>  you are going to feel better every day but you wont look much better until about two weeks.|`|7ff93384150a84022f12b48eda390e79aa	Takes at least 3 months to get results from anything except liposuction. But liposuction, there is a 20 percent chance of death|`|5nfqY9T7aa	You should see results on the scale in two weeks if you stick to it.  Not a big result, nothing visible. You gotta give it more time to get any real results.|`|RRr0BH6oaa	i would say you could start to see results in about 2 weeks but if your 125 you wouldn't see as of results as a person who was 225 and overweight but 30Min's is defiantly a good habit.
aVY52WDgaa	You don't remember them-----me either.....used to....<br>  <br>  Alcohol,drugs,not getting enough sleep,stress--all things that can mess up your dreams.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Have a good talk with your subconscious.  That's where your dreaming comes from.  Just get right in there and work it out.  Dreaming is my way of knowing my mind is still working.........<br>  <br>  Yeah, I do wonder about myself sometimes.<br>  <br>  Tristen:  You are wrong.  You dream more as you age.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	you have to sleep deep and relaxed and not thinking about any thing just go and watch a comedy movie and you will sleep well and if you reach your deep sleep you will dream and when you awake in the morning try to awake without the alarm best of luck and sweet  dreams|`|AA10598987	you know that u drean everyday for about 90 minutes at night but sometimes they are extremly unimportant and u forget everything when u wake up so yes u do dream its just that maybe thier really not important and short that u dont remember that u dreamed so its alright|`|9YWvGTjuaa	if u think about dreaming before bed, usually u dont dream. if the day u have have is weird or bad, usually u have one. somedays ur creative, you think of a good movie. some days ur sad, you think of a horror.|`|7oiBFIguaa	As you get older you dream less and less, and its not that uncommon. I dont dream either. I havnt in like 7 years.|`|awLr3uCaaa	Dreaming occurs during the REM stage of sleep. During this stage, brain activity increases and your eyes move around rapidly behind your eyelids. Many teenagers do not get adequate sleep at night and it takes quite a while to enter into REM sleep. You probably are sleeping in the REM stage, but not as much as most people and thus, you don't remember your dreams as vividly. Try getting in bed earlier. You'll definitely dream more. :-)|`|Lh4u1zwpaa	you dream during REM sleep<br>  if you don't wake up during REM (rapid eye movement) you won't remember your dream<br>  everyone dreams though|`|zzb2Zhz6aa	you'r enot worried or excited about anythingg. lol. maybe if you worry enough about not dreaming you'll have a dream about itt. haha thats happened to me|`|4t0NN0x4aa	You might not be getting deep asleep enough to dream.|`|VjrP5iS4aa	that is true you have over thousands of dreams every night but most people will not rember them usually the only time i will remeber a dream is if its something very heavy on my mind|`|AyaBvAOsaa	you always dream <br>  you might just not remeber it<br>  and the average dream only lasts 5-6 seconds|`|J21hd1Z9aa	ur probably to stressed and ur brain is tired

RXI8ImdIaa	Well I don't really go in for the conspiracy theory (see above) but I'll agree that circumcision is not the immediate first choice here.<br>  <br>  He *does* need to see a urologist though, and soon. He needs to start loosening that foreskin up, this should have been done every day since his infancy so it's going to take a while to correct it.<br>  <br>  Make sure he is doing everything under the supervision of a doctor. We don't want him to stretch too hard; damaging the skin will only make his problem worse.|`|AA10350894	Have him visit the doc, but instead of inquiring about a circumcision, have him ask about stretching exercises and a steroid cream. Circumcision should only be considered as a last resort.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	yeh, i think theres something called a dorsal slit that can fix that<br>  <br>  he can try stretching excercises and maybe get a steroid cream to loosen up the skin|`|B3Cd58ehaa	ya I sugest you go to a doctor about this|`|RvddYKqjaa	Well, someone should have taught him to pull that foreskin back when he was a child. A child needs to learn to pull back that skin very gently and clean underneath there. With time, the foreskin then becomes more flexible. Adult circumcision isn't something to take lightly. It's very painful. Ask your husband to start gradually, but to try to pull the skin back a little each day. Is it painful for him when you have sex?  The skin must go back then when he is erect. My husband had never been taught to pull his foreskin back and ended up having circumcision as an adult. It takes quite a while to heal. You may have to resort to that, but I would certainly get a doctor's advice. Perhaps there is a less painful method of getting that foreskin to retract more. I sympathize with him.|`|O5s0lpGyaa	I used to have that problem when I was a kid...<br>  My foreskin didn′t come down...<br>  <br>  MY solution.....Circumcision....<br>  <br>  And now it feels so much better!!!...<br>  It′s hotter....sex it′s even better....=P...lol|`|2fYdY1fiaa	tell him to cut it off!|`|TsjqzanQaa	It sounds like a rather severe case of phimosis.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is never necessary or desirable, and there is an operation called a preputioplasty which can solve this, if stretching can't accomplish retraction.<br>  <br>  Circumcsion can cause complete dysfunction, as well as many other adverse effects and complications that the doctors do not disclose and in fact suppress.<br>  <br>  For a doctor who isn't intent on mutilating him by circumcision, you can look up DOC or Doctors Opposing Circumcision on your browser.<br>  <br>  If you pick just any doctor, he'll probably try to talk him into a circumcision; they make money from it and are frequently members of the religions that try to impose the mutilation of circumcision on all males.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Been there - done that!  Scared spitless to see a doctor.  Finally screwed up enough intestinal fortitude to see a Urologist for evaluation.  Circumcision procedure done in his office under local anesthestic 12 weeks ago.  No pain.  Very little discomfort.  From the time I walked in until I walked out only took 45 minutes.  It was almost healed in 4 weeks & completely healed in 6 weeks.  Not much limitation except no sports or sex for 6 weeks.  Use judgement as to type of clothing to wear, etc.  No big deal.  Get it done & over with.  He will be much happier & satisfied.

RRr0BH6oaa	the only problem with protein shakes is sometimes people are taking 40 to 60g  of protein at one time which isnt good try to get about 20 to 30 grams in one shake and you should never have a problem and really get a good work out in only working out one body part a day and you could turn out to be diesel|`|bGusd3Bjaa	ok, there is no fast way to gain muscle.  Those protein shakes are not bad for you, theyre good for you its just protein.  Im not into getting jacked, more just staying fit and in shape but my brother is big. He drinks them after every workout.  To gain muscle, eat lots of protein and overall calories, but workout 5 times a week.  work different muscle groups every day so that you dont put to much strain on your body.  if you want to get big then do more weight, if you just want to be slim but muscular, do more repetitions.  Consistency is key, dont just work out twice a week and expect to gain a lot of muscle.  Keep working out as hard as you can and you will start gaining muscle mass relatively fast.  In the first few weeks you should get a lot stronger then it will go a little slower but just keep working and you will keep gaining muscle.  also, make sure you eat healthy.

Your parents NEED to understand that you probably have re-injured your knee (and made it worse).  <br>  <br>  I understand that you were concerned about your grade - but running was a really bad idea - if you tore a muscle or ligament, that won't show up on an X-Ray - you'll need an MRI.  If you tore a tendon, you might see some of that on an X-Ray but soft tissue doesn't really show up well unless you get an MRI.<br>  <br>  At this point, ice it, elevate it and wrap it (wrapping it will help to manage the inflammation but if it starts throbbing - it's too tight).  <br>  <br>  I really hope that your parents will take you to get immediate care - if surgery is needed, you may need to wait until the swelling goes down - but ONLY A DR CAN TELL YOU FOR SURE and (in my opinion) you NEED to make sure that the dr understands how much pain you're in (you remind me of myself - try to "minimize" the pain so no one is upset - but that only causes you more pain because you're trying to "be strong").  If you Dr understands the extent (and location ) of the pain, he/she will be able to explain it to your parents.  In the mean time, don't put any weight on it, don't go up/down stairs and keep ice on your knee!<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I hope you feel better!
c55O7jqXaa	No one can tell you for sure and I am sure doctors would only be guessing at it too. I suggest you continue with the meds as long as the doctors say and just hope for the best. When you start fooling with the brain with surgery and or meds you risk having side effects for a short time, a long time, or the rest of your life. The brain is a complicated organ that even doctors are stil trying to figure out and medications are not an exact science so they try those, but sometimes they work and sometimes not. <br>  <br>  I hope that it will go away soon. Maybe since your leg tremor went away maybe you hand will in time. <br>  <br>  My Husband has tremors in his hands because of the medication he takes and there is not much he can do since he needs the medication. Just one of those side effects. He always shakes, but some days it is so bad that he can hardly keep anything in his hands. <br>  <br>  Hang in there.

For me too, when I get in different positions it relieves the pain. <br>  I went to my doctor and I was diagnosed with a thyroid condition. There are a few diseases that can cause mild to moderate chest pain. Anemia can cause chest pain and a high heart rate. Also a Thyroid disease can cause a racing or heavy heart beat, accompanied by chest pain. Acid Reflux also give pretty bad chest pain. Many people think that they are having a heart attack but it ends up just being acid burning the esofegas and causing pain. <br>  Whatever the cause may be, you should see your doctor. He will do some simple blood work and be able to tell if any of these diseases are affecting your heart or are related to  your chest pain.<br>  <br>  Do you think that you heavy heart beat may be because of anxiety of the chest pain? I know when I have chest pain, I freak out some and then my heart rate is about 120 bpm.

ParFJxnSaa	It may well be dysthymia (same treatment applies). Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes of exercise, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly in daytime, outside. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, (a free E course in it is at: <a href="http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome" rel="nofollow">http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome</a> ) or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).|`|rRIiY6Itaa	Maybe something your eating. Doubt it though if its lasted so long. I suffered from depression for a few months. It was a mental thing.

HKZk1yqmaa	yeah its just like smoking through a pipe....it is just as bad for you as smoking it in a paper or whatever, and the thing that is different about it is you can smoke with other people, at the same time, that is what makes it a hookah|`|HoHHpwDlaa	hey there :]<br>  <br>  1)So here's the breakdown. At the top, there a bowl and in that bowl you put shisha. Shisha is tobacco mixed with honey, glycerine or molasses and flavoring. You cover the bowl with foil and put coals on top. The coals heat up the tobacco. When you inhale fomr the hose, it's like a vaccuum. Air is sucked into the holes in the foil, the smoke from the shisha travels down the stem, into the water at the bottom (which works as a coolant and filter) and out through the hoses. <br>  <br>  2) Smoking in general is not good for you. But, it is better than cigs. <br>  The shisha can go through a washing process. Think of a tea bag effect.. the tabacco gets put into water and a substantial amount of the nicotine and tar is removed. But, there's also some shisha that hasn't been washed. Either way, washed or unwashed, cigs have 599 chemicals like arsenic and ammonia. Not to mention, cigs are addictive because the cigarette companies purposely put things in there to MAKE it addictive. Also, cigs have 30% nicotine while shisha only has .5% nicotine. <br>  <br>  It would take A LOT to get addicted to shisha. For example, a friend of mine smokes cigs. Even though we had already smoked a bowl, she was still feeling anxious because she hadn't smoked a cig yet. I asked her "The nicotine in the shisha didn't really do anything for you?" She almost laughed and said "No Way! i'd be smoking shisha all day long trying to get my nicotine fix. I need my cigs."  I've been smoking for a while now, but i NEVER feel any sort of jitters, or anxious-ness. Even and experienced of 10 years can walk away and never feel the need to smoke again, which, in my opinion, is awesome. <br>  <br>  I really like smoking hookah because, although i know it isn't good for my body, i know that it's a lot safer than smoking cigs, illegal substances, and drinking. It's something i do for fun. <br>  <br>  Oh, and one more thing, a hookah is NOT USED FOR ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES.   :]   <br>  <br>  Well, i hope i helped!|`|2K43LgeWaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookah" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookah</a>|`|iehHfrlAaa	A hookah is a water pipe that's used for smoking. It's pretty much a bong. The flavored tobacco you speak is typically tobamel. It's tobacco with molasses and other flavors. Smoking from a hookah is still smoking - it's bad for you. You inhale more tobacco from a hookah than you would be smoking a cigarette. You may not but inhaling all the chemical additives of a cigarette but you will be getting a good dose of the toxic compounds found in tobacco. Hookah smoking also delivers a decent amount of nicotine. I, however, have never met someone who "feels" like they have to smoke from a hookah. If you smoke hookah everyday for about 30 minutes a session, it will be just as bad as cigarettes. If you use it weekly or bi-weekly, not nearly so.|`|r5c20sY1aa	a hookah is a tool/apparatus used to smoke flavored tobacco<br>  <br>  It makes your breath smell very very bad too.....believe me I have been around those who smoke it and it is just awful.

Depression can vary greatly from person to person but the first signs are usually what you have described, feeling tired, lack or caring about things you used to, and suicidal thoughts. Although this may just be a phase you really should try and nip it in the bud by speaking to a councilor. Depression is described as chronic when someone shuts them self away, stops eating or overeats, has poor Hygiene, self harm or suicide attempts. Most people recover and remember everyone has or will have some sort of depression in there lives. please do not feel ashamed.

While many of the medicinal herbs seem to provide temporary results or very minimal benefits, there is one that stands out and appears to be really efficient. This memory herb is called Ginko Biloba.  The extract from the ginkgo biloba plant is used for treating Alzheimer's disease and other health problems that are often correlated with memory loss and even short term memory loss.    Foremost, using a ginkgo biloba herbal remedy will improve the blood flow to the brain. As a matter of fact, by doing this, the ginkgo biloba herbal remedy assures the oxygenation of the brain.  The brain requires 20% of the total amount of oxygen that is consumed by the body. If the brain does not receive the necessary quantity, people feel dizzy, become amnesic and lose their concentration problem. In addition, the ginkgo biloba herbal remedy improves the blood circulation throughout the entire body.  Furthermore, the ginkgo biloba herbal remedy improves the blood circulation by other means, too. It prevents the cholesterol from turning into plaque. If this transformation succeeds, the plaque gets deposited on the arteries, fact that determines the blood to circulate with difficulty. The major consequence of this fact is stroke. As it is well known, stroke represents one of the major causes of memory loss.  The ginkgo biloba herbal remedy may also be used in the treatment of other diseases. The ginkgo biloba extract contains more than 40 active substances. However, two of them seem to be responsible of the majority of the benefits. Flavonoids and terpenoids are two types of antioxidants that enhance the immune system, prevent the brain from aging and fight the free radicals.  Before being added to a ginkgo biloba herbal remedy, the extract that is obtained from the leaves of the ginkgo biloba tree must be processed. The leaves must not be used in a raw state, because they contain ginkgolic acids, which are poisonous substances. Furthermore, the ginkgo biloba herbal remedy must have a certain concentration and must respect several international standards.<br>                                                                Could you swallow a memory-wiping pill?                                                         <br>                                                            It might seem tempting to be able to erase bad memories, but what about the potential dangers.<br>   Is pain affecting your memory?<br>   <br>   Poll Closed.?

8OJPm0Vsaa	Organs, Muscle tone and lean muscle. <br>  NOT GOOD!!! <br>  Your body will start to eat the lining of your stomach(meaning and ulcer) and other organs and you need some fat around your heart to protect it and stay healthy. You could be at risk for SOOO MANY health problems.<br>  Here are some risks:<br>  <br>  -* decreased blood pressure<br>  <br>  * ulcers<br>  <br>  * loss of menstrual cycle in women<br>  <br>  * blood poisoning<br>  <br>  * increased mental problems like depression<br>  <br>  * serious heart problems<br>  <br>  * decayed tooth enamel <br>  <br>  *Anemia<br>  <br>  *Shortened life span<br>  <br>  *Lung Problems<br>  <br>  *Osteoporosis<br>  <br>  *Death! <br>  <br>  *Infertility (in women.) <br>  <br>  Also its physically impossible to have no fat on your body, you will always have a little.

No fat on your body is just not good! <br>  Good luck!|`|y1Hxl0NOaa	Yes after you lose all of your body fat, your body starts burning muscle. What is your goal?

Someone who is starving will start to "burn" muscle.  It causes something called ketoacidosis, which the body can not stand for long.  Then kidney damage sets in.  Then death.<br>  <br>  So no one should lose all or even most of their body fat.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	No~! LOL. You wont EVER loose ALL the body fat~!!! Your body needs fat therefore the defense mechanism will kick in. Besides its VERY unhealthy to be very lean, what would you do if you went to a hospital and needs a strength to survive? The body will need an energy from a body fat to keep you going.

jA95EaA4aa	According to your ovulation calendar, you're most fertile day is going to be on the 9th. By taking the day after pill you've reduced the chance that you'll get pregnant, but it's not 100% effective. So if you notice that you're next period is late, take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, you have options. You can have the baby, put the baby up for adoption, or have an abortion. Remember that you always have a choice and that this is your decision. Go with what feels right.|`|wgAh0vtgaa	If you took the morning after pill you fine, don't worry.|`|0c63fdd0630be2f6cbd717d497ab2474aa	If you took the morning after pill so quickly, you will almost certainly not become pregnant.<br>  <br>  In the future, though, you should not stop taking your birth control just because you're on antibiotics. You're correct that antibiotics reduce the effectiveness of the pill, but it doesn't make it completely ineffective. In addition, if you're taking progestogen only pills, those aren't affected at all by antibiotics.|`|dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	Ok, don't worry so much just yet. Just because you weren't on the pill just then doesn't necessarily mean that you conceived anyway. You took the precaution afterwards and you've got a little bit of waiting yet to do so don't put the cart before the horse. More than likely the plan B will work because that's its job. If you do turn out to be pregnant, your options are keeping the baby, adoption, abortion (even though i hate the idea of this it is still an option but please consider adoption!) and those are all that i can think of right off. Good luck to you.|`|qiDMTNvDaa	Well, If you ARE pregnant, then talk to your parents... it might seem stupid but its probably the best idea. Also, consider HAVING the babyand putting it up for adoption. Thats the smart thing.|`|qLuodu3Raa	if you took plan b i do not think that you have anything to worry about if you are pregnant the only option you really have is to have a baby i mean other than becoming a murderer|`|Eec9JeXbaa	the morning after pill should work if you took it this quick. <br>  <br>  Sometimes even if the condom beaks, it doesn't mean you get pregnant.<br>  I know many girls who get pregnant just by seeing someones d*ck, but many and I mean many girls struggle to get pregnant even if they want to.<br>  I was not on the pill for 8 yrs and never got pregnant with many accidents.<br>  <br>  if the worst happens, you can monitor your period and if you're late, go and see a doc. Up to two months of pregnancy you can get a pill that will cause you to bleed and miscarry.|`|mnkZ6VS9aa	Honestly, if you were that responsible, you would have thought about your options of pregnancy BEFORE you started engaging in sexual activity. There's no use in telling you what you should have done, because we both know that all of that has already been said and done. <br>  <br>  Anyway, if you took Plan B, I would not worry too much about it. Take the second pill (if you haven't already), and wait out your period. Try not to stress out too much about it because stress can make you miss your period, thus making you stressed out even more. <br>  <br>  The only options you have if you ever become pregnant are:<br>  a) to have the baby, of course<br>  b) abort <br>  c) put the baby up for adoption <br>  <br>  Neither of those choices are simple nor easy to endure. Adopting or abortion can both be traumatizing experiences to any young woman. Having a baby will totally change your life, and you'll definitely have to live differently. <br>  <br>  So, wait out your period, and take a pregnancy test to make sure. And please, PLEASE, think more about your consequences BEFORE having sex. I don't think you're any less responsible, because I know we all make mistakes. Just be sure you learn from it.

If you are really concerned see a doctor. Until then rogain is an over the counter treatment. There is even a rogain for women.

GEfUTyi8aa	You probably dont have lung cancer now, but if this keeps up when you get older you could end up with it, just like anyone exposed to second hand smoke.   We all have to take care of ourselves and not breathing anyone elses cigarette smoke is a start.  You shouldnt have to breath the smoke your mother tosses around the house.. unfortunately she doesnt see it that way.   There is a reason the government cracked down on smoking in public places.... they didnt do it because they thought smoking was good for people... and the government is losing billions of dollars when people stop smoking so that should tell us something.  I think you should get pamphlets and put them around the house... get those ones where they show the inside of a cancer lung from smoking... then tell her it stinks.... complain incessantly..... tell her people talk about the smell on your cloths... make her feel bad.... research second hand smoke on the net and print out the articles..... make her life hell for smoking... and tell her if you get sick its her fault.....you shouldnt have to live this way.. if she wants to smoke, she can stand outside ....... that is what a responsible parent would do....... well.. responsible parents who have children wouldnt smoke in the first place..... they should set good examples and show they care by taking care of themselves.... too many kids end up without parent/s at young ages due to these kinds of things.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|YX5dh2aSaa	The chances of you having lung cancer is very small. Although she's been smoking around you for awhile, you are only inhaling passive smoke and lung cancer of someone your age is quite rare. If everyone developed lung cancer from being around a smoking family member for awhile, it would be much more of an epidemic than it already is. <br>  Signs include constant cough, chest pain, wheezing, coughing up blood and shortness of breath.|`|87Dne23saa	my grandfather has had lung cancer. im sure deep down your mother feels bad for not being able to stop smoking, maybe you cud ask her to at leas just do it outside or by an open window only... to cover the smell i would NEVER wear my clothes more then once, EVER... it just made the smell worse. dont worry about lung cancer, if your mom goes to the doctor shes fine. thats none of your bisiness.|`|MdknQ2Mkaa	Peter, I remember when doctors did house calls!  Anyways, not only you at risk, there is now studies of 3rd hand smoke now.  My grandfather died of emphasema from smoking.  My mother is now dealing with lung cancer.  We just found out this last week, and she felt fine and is a stage 3.  She has always smoked.  Growing up I hated being around anyone who smoked.  I spent alot of time in my room and wouldn't allow anyone in my room.  Your mom is going to have to want to stop.  Telling her is not going to get her to stop.  It think some people don't quit til they get a health scare.  Does my mom smoke now, no, but its kind of late for that.  When I would go to visit her, she smoked outside, I didn't not go out with her.|`|52cGZS3caa	Honey, I am sure I am older than your mom and I am a smoker. When I found out that passive smoke was not good for the kids, I quit doing it around them. When I was your age I remember our family doctor making house calls to see us when we were sick - yes it's true, they really did make house calls! Well, I remember my father and the doctor BOTH smoking in my bedroom while they discussed my illness! They just didn't know back then the harm that smoking does. What I am getting at, is - if second hand smoke was THAT dangerous there would have been many millions more lung cancer sufferers from my generation. I am not saying that smoking around you is okay. What I am saying is you needn't worry too much about yourself getting lung cancer. Just never start smoking yourself because it IS terribly difficult to stop once you start!<br>  <br>  (Besides - it stinks! It smells up your hair and clothes and the boys hate kissing a cigarette smelling mouth!)

To find out he needs to see an allergist.  They'll take a history and make arrangements to do skin tests.  There are pills he can then be prescribed, as well as injections he can take, and he'd be given info on how to make his living quarters more friendly to a person with inhalant allergies.  All will help allergies.  If he doesn't have allergies, he needs to see his regular doctor to get to the bottom of his problems.|`|JoWVotMvaa	My husband used to be sick like that. His immune system was just really low. If you weren't breast fed as a baby that can happen. Other things can also cause low immune systems.<br>   The best thing he can do is get a good multi vitamin, also aciddophilus is really good for theimmunee system, and vitamin C. I would get him to take all of those. Also make sure he gets at least 15 minutes of sunshine everyday. That gives you your daily dose of vitamin D. if he cant then he needs to take vitamin D too. <br>   Vitacost.com is a great place to buy vitamins and supplements and people rate them so you know your getting good ones.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	He should talk to a doctor about this, his immune system could be down.  Also it could be something more serious than a cold especially since he runs a fever with it.

Like I really do thing that and when you get into your OB appointment bring that up! I have endo and you sound like me a lot!

LX0vjwXPaa	.... to be able to do what???<br>  <br>  There isn't really a "should" to weight lifting.  It's a matter of what you want.  <br>  <br>  In most "competitions" however, the general consensus is % of bodyweight.  In a recent muscle and fitness magazine, they did a "fit test" onboard an Aircraft Carrier that was the maximum # of reps of 110% of your bodyweight that could be done in 3 sessions.  The winner did like 79 reps.|`|IGAx1FgEaa	idk.... depends on how much muscle u have.... start low and work your way up|`|RRr0BH6oaa	if you've never benched before or haven't benched that much then there is no real suggested amount you should be doing but it is always good to be able to do your own body weight about 8 times for someone who constantly works out. if youve never worked out before try 135 or so you could probably put that up easy just see what you can do and make sure you have good form to it|`|Tb4RW8LLaa	it depends on who you are, my friend is 140 and benches 250, my other friend is 6'5 and benches 190, everyone is different

DtBx851Maa	It's OK, you're still growing.  My bro is 13 and he looks like a pole.  He probably eats 4000 calories a day.  The best thing to do is just eat whenever you're hungry and stop when you're full.  And don't worry about it! You'll even out with everyone else eventually|`|QsVMeaPXaa	Look at your family. Are they thin, or one of the parents thin? If not ask them or look at family photos. You really haven't hit your growth spurt and you just might find yourself packing it on in a year or two!!<br>  <br>  Come on, you can find one thing in the kitchen you will eat. If not and you eat dairy products, drink a glass of whole milk.|`|IGAx1FgEaa	ur metabolism... u have a fast metabolism.... eat things with a lot of protein in it such as meat.

Or maybe you're not eating enough, make sure you OVERSTUFF yourself, I'm serious.|`|hDHDkx4Raa	How tall are you.  Maybe you're only supposed to weigh 85 lbs.|`|VL22iykvaa	yeah, ur still pretty young. id say weight lift with less weight and higher reps and eat lots of meats and cheese (protein). in a couple years, start drinking protein shakes, like muscle milk. it tastes good and has all the right proteins.|`|7ngoAT2xaa	you probably have high metabolism & since your still growing you get taller & tend to loose weight same thing with me
h2kMk88faa	She's probably referring to a diet high in lean proteins and slow digesting carbs. So, stick with lean beef, skinless chicken, 2% fat milk, and a lot of fish for your protein and whole wheat bread, oatmeal and brown rice for your carbs. Keep your fat intake to a minimum and be sure to use flax oil or olive oil instead of butter or oleo.|`|s0wBK9eYaa	I would recommend going on a low carb diet for the most part. At the beginning of this you might feel a bit sluggish but stick with it and you'll have amazing energy! Also eat coconut oil before each meal to boost your energy and increase your metabolism. I would also recommend eating fermented foods like sauerkraut, kumbucha, or other fermented foods/drinks to help with the digestion and keep you healthy. Really you just want to try to eat healthier and cut out all processed junk including margarine and other fake foods. Contrary to popular opinion real foods (like butter, milk, etc) are good for you and much more so than their fake counterparts like oleo. Personally I eat butter, cream, whole milk, and fatty beef and have never had more energy and felt so good. To help you compete the best here is what I would recommend:<br>  For 3 days:<br>  Eat a low carb diet with lots of good fats and protein. <br>  4th day:<br>  Eat a diet higher in carbs (good ones though) to help boost your metabolism and give you energy
SbkOosNaaa	It truly depends on your insurance plan but an MRI of the shoulder without contrast costs approx $1700-$2000. Check with your insurance provider and be tough sometimes they don't give out the info readily.<br>  Hope you feel better.|`|Q8m6BGKVaa	The MRI costs anywhere from $3000 - 6000, how much your insurance covers and how much exactly your co-payment might be (of if the insurance covers at all) depends on your individual plan.  Make sure you contact your insurance first before you make this kind of appointment and know exactly how much you need to cover (otherwise you'll be responsible for everything that's not being covered by the insurance)|`|IgqdBGEBaa	As mentioned in the previous answer, insurance "costs" for a shoulder MRI vary. The key is what is the actual payment to the imaging center (or hospital) and what is your share. That will depend on the type of health plan you are in.<br>  <br>  If you're curious about how much an MRI of the shoulder costs without insurance, you can see prices here: www.remakehealth.com<br>  <br>  All the best, John H.
THwVItleaa	Well first off you need to ask her about it if she does not know then ask her to see a doctor. always were protection before you jump to any conclusions  it may even be razor burn or a minor rash she may even have an infection like an yeast infection, but, yes i would go ahead and see a doctor.|`|uRlwtLnRaa	UMMMM YEAH. You also may try asking her about it. Communication is the key to any relationship, if you can't talk to her openly and freely maybe she shouldn't be your gf.|`|aC00XDRnaa	Yes! could be vaginal warts or another std.  It my be in your best interest to be checked out your self.|`|wETQbPxGaa	yes!! it sounds like venereal warts!  when you saw this why did you want to have sex with her?|`|QT0qTFyAaa	Hell yes!|`|10kSiDTWaa	She might have Genetial warts, yes you should see a doctor because if you had sex with her you could also get it, i dont think genetial warts is curable but it might be.
Q4ggnG0waa	This sounds suspiciously like a similar poster whose little girl got her wig thrown around. I find it hard to believe they even allowed a camcorder at school. Please don't play around with people's emotions on a VERY serious subject matter.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Go immediately to the principal of her school and tell them what is going on. Take the evidence with you if you have it. Ask to see the guidance counselor and all of her teachers so they get on board with stopping this and letting your daughter fight the important battle of healing. No kid should be subject to such abuse and it is up to the administration to see to it that the people who are doing it are punished.|`|52cGZS3caa	This has got to be phoney! I'm a dad and I would d... sure know what to do if my daughter was being abused like he describes. I wouldn't be here on Y/A asking people how to protect my own daughter! I have never seen or heard about a group of children acting like the ones described here. If it were true it would be all over the news and you would be seeing it on the front page of the local newspaper!<br>  <br>  P.S. Looks as if you got what you want - lots of responses from caring people including the ones with foul, offensive language.|`|716335ab6ea56965d0cb4b7367b650edaa	...#14..... Just who do you think you are accusing someone of faking? Unless like me you are a cancer survivor, or have been a caregiver - zip it!<br>  Now to address the real issue here. Bullying and pure meanness. <br>  <br>  Most schools, public, separate or private have a zero tolerance policy. Don't be afraid to go to the school board, the archdiocese, or the board of governors if you don't get help from the staff. Call in the police and have the ones who stole your daughters bandanna charged with theft and assault. Don't back down on this. <br>  <br>  As for the rest of the kids at her school they need an education session. Perhaps if they learn what cancer is and what your lovely daughter has to go through they'll smarten up.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could enlist the aid of your PTA in this.  Perhaps a local drama club could work up a skit or play based on this. Something in the role playing genre. Failing this you might want to look into the options of home schooling or tutoring. I went this route with a girl from my church. She had a brain cancer and I got her a retired teacher to tutor her. <br>  <br>  Give your daughter a bear hug and tell her it's from a cancer survivor in Canada.|`|AA11020187	What a bunch of horrible brats. Even as a kid I hated bullies and always defended whomever they picked on. I don’t know what is going on in that school, but apparently your daughter never really had any friends, as a friend would not turn their back on her now. I know it’s hard for you, we can’t help but want to fight our kid’s battles and growing up is hard enough without cancer, but your daughter needs to learn how to deal with these kinds of people sooner or later. I think you should go to a counselor and have them guide you on the best way to teach your daughter the things she needs to know and to gain some self-esteem. I also think you should go to the principal without her and have the principal view the video and speak to his or her staff. Bullying should never be tolerated.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  I am the mother of three, including an 11 year old daughter. I am sorry for what you are going through with not only her health, but the terrible behavior of the children-I can not imagine how that would effect my daughter.<br>  <br>  I homeschool my c hildren, and I do recommend it-especially in your situation. We see a wide variety of children in our various activities, and I can tell you that the homeschooled children are better behaved and more well mannered than any other group (overall-not saying they are all perfect).<br>  <br>  If you wish, you can contact me via my profile. I would be glad to discuss this more with you!|`|Or1AKzaoaa	You should try investing in a wig for her. That might help a little and as for the eye brows try getting a wig with bangs. That might help a little. As for her self esteem the only thing you can do it tell her that in a few years none of those people are gonna matter cuse shes going to do bigger and better things then them and that she obviously had a beautiful personality|`|J8FHAIZ2aa	Well, never run from your problems. Trust me. You should go to the princable and look at him with your BEAUTIFUL baby and say what you want him to know. If he doest listen say....<br>  <br>  " OR I WILL CALL THE STATE(if public school)OR I WILL CALL THE ArCHIODISE(if catholic)<br>  <br>  youll do anything for her if you love her.|`|1f5H6kfvaa	Sounds like you're a faker. Anywho.<br>  Report this to the police, the video anyways. I'd also move to another school, as soon as the kids there see her, they'll probably be really nice...|`|ECLYzIXZaa	Oh,it's you again.|`|lFpnsKKyaa	who would do such a thing?? i dont really know if u r telling the truth to be honest. if you are then that is such an unbeleivable horror i really feel for you. i know a little twelve year old with cancer and everyone was very supportive and helped her through it sooo much. some of her friends even shaved their heads in support. i think you should talk to the school. they could inform the kids in assembly about the cancer and its deadliness.  if her friends deserted her then they are not real friends to begin with. be a good parent and talk to the school. they will teach those kids.<br>  but i really hope you are not a faker, because this is something very serious to talk about!|`|oQ5oKILHaa	That is horrible. I don't know what to do. I think just help her understand how mean people are. But that maybe they are just scared of her situaton. <br>  <br>  Tell her how strong she is and that you are proud of her. It will pass and moving might only add more stress. <br>  Good luck and she is going to be in my prayers tonight.<br>  <br>  EDIT: How many times will you post this same message? As far as I'm concerned it sounds trollish which is horrible because it really is a sad situation. Instead I will pray for you to get a conscience.|`|xzwZ3lt3aa	I'm finding your story a little hard to swallow. # 1, all the children I've known who are going through chemo, and have lost their hair, don't go to school.<br>  <br>  # 2, I find it hard to believe that an 11 year old would have a video camera at school<br>  <br>  # 3, this sounds exactly like another story that was on here awhile back<br>  <br>  # 4, anyone who has a private Q & A has something to hide.<br>  <br>  Cancer isn't funny. There's something you should know about. It's called Karma.|`|z8YZY9lOaa	I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope you aren't lying, this sounds kind of unreal but what are you DOING?! she needs to be homeschooled, everyday you are letting your little girl get hurt by all these punk little f u c k i n g c u n t a s s kids please stop putting her through it, talking to the prinicpal will not help, just PLEASE homeschool her so she won't have to be boughtered with those f u c k heads or move to another town, that's kind of a hassle though so either homeschool or move GET HER THE F U CK OUT OF THAT SCHOOL!|`|YX5dh2aSaa	That's horrible. I'd suggest contacting the principle or guidance counselor. A possible effect of that though could be the kids resenting her for getting them in trouble, and her being treated even worse.<br>  Home/cyber school could be a good temporary option. I did that to avoid bullying and it worked out well.<br>  Good luck.
41uH2QC2aa	i get the same things all the time! i think it's anxiety. but it feels really weird and its exactly like that. whatever it is, it's not normal, so if it continues or if its really unsettling then i suggest going to a doctor

Good fo ryou for staying a virgin. I wish I wouldn't have had sex so young. I am now 21 and am waiting until marriage.<br>  <br>  Condoms break 8% of the time.

My oldest son has it (strep) then my younger one (pink eye and viral infection) then me (tonsillitis). I know that strep and tonsillitis can cause nausea and sore throat. Did she look in her throat? If she sees what looks like cold sores (white in color), it's an indication of some bacterial infection like in strep. I'm having the same symptom. The doc told me to take tylenol then 3 hours later take Advil and alternate each 3rd hour between the brand in order to combat the fever, soreness, etc. I've done so and can manage the pain and chills now. He also prescribed amoxicillin for me and gave me a shot of penicillin to make it work faster. Well you know she's gonna have to go to the doctor. She's got an infection of some type. It may or may not be the flu cuz my son was tested for it and he didn't have it but had almost the same symptom as your sister. Tell her to also drink green tea or something hot to calm her chills.
2uOhDMKjaa	Well she is already pretty tall for the average girl. Most people are done growing by about 18 so she could put up another inch or so, but she will probably not reach 6'... maybe 5'10'' lol i would like to be tall too... im 5'5 and would also love to be about 6'.
EeTs9DqUaa	What is ldh?
D8qTbPdraa	All I can suggest is see your doctor just to be sure everything is all right. If you've ever had a sports physical, a doctor checks an artery going from your abdomen area into your leg, so perhaps it could have something to do with that, unless it's actually your /groin/.<br>  <br>  So just go see your doctor.
XwHtuIvnaa	Application areas<br>  <br>  DIMODAN? is used as anti-staling agents - or crumb softeners - in bread.<br>  <br>  One of DIMODAN?'s main functionalities is mediated through starch complexing. Starch consists of two types of carbohydrate, amylose and amylopectin. When starch is mixed with water and heated, these two types of carbohydrate swell and form a gel from which the starch components slowly recrystallise. This phenomenon is known as retrogradation and is responsible for the staling process in bread.<br>  <br>  Amylose retrogradation occurs more rapidly than amylopectin retrogradation due to the difference in the molecular size and structure of the two types of carbohydrate. <br>  <br>  Other examples of application areas of DIMODAN? include:<br>  <br>      * anti-sticking agents in pasta, instant mashed potatoes and cereals<br>      * emulsion stabilisation in margarine<br>      * emulsion destabilisation in ice cream<br>      * trans fat replacement<br>  <br>  It's actually good for you!|`|gmvusL2gaa	its jus a chemical it's ok if u lyk rice and stuff|`|xfv6526Gaa	Well monoglyceride is nothing more then a carbohydrate so I'm sure you would be fine
Y3ghamr7aa	Targeted weight loss was quite difficult until I tried acai berry!!<br>  <br>  Haha jkjk. <br>  umm you should eat them all.<br>  Mice taste very good in a stew cooked with rat legs and weasle tails|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Well his method is probably a bit harsh, but in essence, he is right.  The lowly mouse is completely incapable of harming you in any way.  If you had 50 mice sitting in your lap, they still couldn't harm you.  So instead you need to realize that yes, they are fast little bugger and they make you jump, that is OK.. but real fear is irrational.  Maybe the best thing you could do is start by going to the pet store and just observe mice in the cage.  See them run in the wheel and look at them in an environment where you can see them for what they really are... tiny little harmless creatures.  Worst thing they do is poop.  Which is obnoxious and you dont want it in your house.. but nothing to freak about.  So if you can do that.. go look at them in the pet store... next step I would say is to look at lots of pics of them online and perhaps even buy one at the pet store and keep it and care for it.  You will see that they are sweet affectionate little creatures.  They just want to survive like you survive.  They have to be sneaky and lightening fast to survive at all, because they are the bottom of the food chain.  Everything from cats to owls to foxes and wolves rely on them for food supply.  you would scurry about pretty quick too if that was the case.  So best thing to do is just start with a place of rationality.. move from there it acceptance, and then perhaps even affection.   I have had them as pets and they really are sweet little creatures.  Very smart.  And even a really angry pissed off mouse doing its very best to defend itself could not do more than give you a pinch on the finger.  It is impossible for them to harm you in any way.|`|iRFsu2kVaa	Nuke the little things!|`|e747c2c4f42307a0319a41df54a314d0aa	get a kitty,maybe?worked for me !!!!!!! no mice here now.|`|Qknj2fILaa	I can totally relate to you.  I don't like mice at all but that isn't my problem. I have an irrational fear of horses.  The pure sight of even a picture of one freaks me out. I can feel my heart racing and my knees getting weak when I see one.  Nobody else understands this. They say this is an irrational fear but I don't really think it is. I see them as being huge animals that will bite you and kick you and stampede you, etc. I'm not sure why I feel this way. All  I know is I've been like this as long as I can remember.  I feel sorry for you because those little critters just sometimes won't go away. Call an exterminator and they will get rid of them for you. Tell your boyfriend to stop being insensitive because I know you really can't help it.  Good luck!
sQu3LLqtaa	To ensure that you get enough complete protein for height growth if you are still growing you could combine the mostly incomplete protein in beans, peas, lentils and nuts with the mostly incomplete protein in bread, cereals, pasta and rice to make up complete protein.  This is known as protein complementing.  If you are a vegan you need to resort to protein complementing to get adequate amounts of complete protein.<br>  <br>  Pesco vegetarians consume fish and other sea food, lacto vegetarians consume dairy products and ovo vegetarians consume eggs. <br>  <br>  Besides the protein problem there are other hazards in a vegetarian or vegan diet that you can find in web searches for "vegetarian diet" + "health hazards" and vegan + "health hazards".<br>  <br>  Perhaps you might also want to post your question in the Vegetarian & Vegan section under Food & Drink.|`|3Rqq6WjDaa	well you could buy vitamin supluments for it, that would work|`|G4MKs2wmaa	I was the same way.  When I stopped eating dairy for medical reasons, I was very angry.  And then when I was allowed to eat dairy again I did not want to, it sickened me to even think about eating it.  So, what I did since I missed ice cream so much was i ate a tablespoon of it here and there and after a couple of weeks, about 2, I was able to eat it again.  I am still eating it now.

fadeVH4baa	Not sure if it's an STD it could be Mulluscum contagious, this skin disease can be passed by skin contact by also sexually. <br>  <br>  Since you have it on your genitals, you could have spread them from other parts of your body (if there are any elsewhere) by scratching but it is certain that (if this is mulluscum) you passed her to your girlfriend or she passed them to you. <br>  <br>  Although it could also just be a reaction to a new lubricant. So try not using any moisturizers/lubricants and soaps on your penis for a while. If they don't disappear best to consult a doctor.|`|zYXkPwhHaa	your not washing it properly, pull the foreskin back all the way, and wash thouroughly with soap, i had these when i was around 12 (back when i was starting to get dirty like an adult but showered like a kid), theyll go away eventually as long as you wash,

Wanta get back in presentable shape?  TRY - no smoking, no beer/ale, no booze, no drugs, no junk food, no fast food garbage, no sugary sweet soda's.  Get on a healthy, balanced diet including lots of boiled or steamed vegetables.  Drink plenty of water, fruit juices & fat free milk.  Snack on lots of RAW fruit & veggies.  Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner.  Whenever time permits, do sit ups, push ups, pull ups & skipping rope.  Within 90 days you should see fantastic results.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	I’ve used Lunapads, as well as other brands such as Gladrags and Hagrags, Lunapads are the best brand and the nicest people, although personally I don’t use pads as I’m too heavy for them so I have to use a menstrual cup (which are great too FYI). Take a look at this page on Lunapads site <a href="http://www.lunapads.com/switch.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lunapads.com/switch.htm</a> or look at cloth pad communities online, like this; <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/cloth_pads" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/cloth_p...</a> there are hundreds of great sites online about menstrual alternatives like cloth pads, go check them out! :o) <br>  <br>  Pros;<br>  <br>  ? More comfortable – commercial pads are made form synthetics so prevent aeration making your groin sweaty, they come unstuck so stick to you rather than your panties, and they gather up, plus they are synthetics, plastics and chemicals so can cause irritation – cloth pads are far more comfortable as they’re softer and don’t move about or gather up. Lunapads in particular are the best cloth brand for comfort, sit well, and their padded panties are good.  <br>  <br>  ? Safer and more hygienic – commercial pads synthetics make your groin warm and moist, this is the perfect environment for bacteria and yeast, commercial pads also contain chemicals and bleach (used purely to make pads whiter) these can not only cause irritation but can interfere with vaginal pH which can also increase growth of harmful vaginal/vulva flora – cloth pads let your groin ‘breathe’ so keeps you dry, and they don’t contain harmful ingredients. A lot of women using commercial options find they experience reoccurring bacterial, yeast and urinary infections. <br>  <br>  ? Cheaper – cloth pads can last up to 5 years with good care, although the initial price is more they do cost far less than disposable pads, it also saves on cost of treating re-occurring bacterial, yeast or urinary infections pads can cause. Cloth pads really need little care, they can just be shoved into the washer along with your clothes, or you can soak them beforehand. <br>  <br>  ? Environment – a woman will use around 12,000+ pads in her lifetime, not only does this mean a lot of waste but manufacturing is also an issue because of non-organic cotton, synthetics made from only 30% of the wood forested, plastics that aren’t biodegradable, and various chemicals. Commercial companies have no problem saying environmental impact isn’t their problem, they are self-regulated so can do as they please and use almost whatever chemicals they want – excluding chlorine gas bleaching, they previously used this knowing it resulted in cancer-causing dioxin, we don’t know the true environmental or health cost of current chemicals used. <br>  <br>  ? Consumer ethics – commercial companies are well known for knowingly using harmful ingredients, for products not being independently safety tested, keeping information from customers, and using menstrual taboos and women’s body-issues to sell products. Many commercial menstrual product companies are owned by larger parent companies that have similar low ethics when it comes to health, environment, and welfare. <br>  <br>  ? Happier periods – seriously, if you’re more comfortable and turn your back on menstrual taboos that say ‘menstruation is dirty so you must use these super-white bleached wads of synthetics’ your view of menstruation changes, knowing your doing your bit for your health, the environment and small women-owned ethical companies is great, so too is feeling more comfortable. <br>  <br>  Cons; <br>  <br>  ? Takes getting used to – there is a sort of mental block where you feel dirty if not using disposable products, you know that cloth pads are more hygienic and better for you and the environment, but you can still feel a little uncomfortable at times if you’re having a bad day.<br>  <br>  ? They do require changing more often - although I’m saying this as someone with very heavy periods, there is no plastic backing as you have on commercial pads as an extra layer to protect your clothing – with commercial pads you can flood the thing but that plastic layer prevents mess on clothing. Cloth pads come in different sizes, different styles (like g-style, check out Reddy’s pads) and you can add more liners to your pad if you need to, but it does take time to get used to changing pads more often. <br>  <br>  ? You have to carry used pads with you – if you change in public bathrooms you take the used pad with you, in all fairness you have to do this with commercial pads too if there is no bin in the bathroom, at least with cloth pads they don’t smell as bad and you will already be prepared with a little carry bag…but still, not my style to carry used pads with me, I can’t imagine it very convenient.|`|6qsocyK3aa	They're no worse than reusable nappies and plenty of people use those on their kids so ignore anyone who is grossed out.<br>  <br>  The pros are that you would be looking after the environment and would probably save money in the long run because disposable pads are expensive. They also look pretty funky. <br>  <br>  I honestly can't think of any cons apart from some people might think you are bit gross. But they have no reason to and you don't have to tell them anyway.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	yuk yuk|`|FWWegktKaa	I'm sorry but I don't really like the idea. I would hate the idea of using it again.<br>  There is also no point in them being pretty colours because you bleed on them so it kind of defeats the whole point. Lol<br>  <br>  The pros are that it kind to the environment and you save money.<br>  <br>  The cons I think are the fact that you have to wash them all the time and if you don't like blood it's a bit strange.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't choose them but it's your choice and no one can really decide for you.|`|uV7TFgLqaa	Just sounds gross. I don't think I would feel very clean. On the other hand, it's great for the environment.

M1rnHg5Raa	I had the same problem.  I finally went to my dermatologist and the doctor set me up with 3 skin care products that I use everyday.  #1. Tea Tree Wash. #2. A skin toner that I use after washing. #3. An awesome product called, "Glytone" that I put on as the final step.  There are many kinds of Tea Tree washes and toners - the dermatologist will set you up with the ones that are best for you.  And the Glytone - it's amazing!<br>  Good luck to you!|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Don't scrub your skin. You are damaging it more. Treat your skin gently.

I've had the same issue as a teen and a young adult. Going to a dermalogist can help. I was told to use Hibacleans, you can get over the counter at walmart, CVS. Aqua- blue bottle, Usually used at hospitals to kill bacteria. However DO NOT get in your eyes, as it will make you blind.  Going to a tanning bed will also help dry out the skin, but if you over do it then you end up with dry skin. Good luck!

PGkR813Jaa	How long did you take the medication before you just stopped it?<br>  It takes between 2 or 3 weeks for antidepressants to have the feeling of working. The drug needs to build up in your system.<br>  <br>  As for the throwing up and eye twitch, these are telling me that you are still suffering from anxiety.<br>  Depression also causes anxiety and nausea in a lot of people.<br>  <br>  I think you need to go back to your treating Doctor ASAP to be re-started on your medication.<br>  If a medication is not working for you, you NEED to GO BACK and get it adjusted.<br>  Doctor's will always start you off on a low dose then build you up until it starts to take effect without throwing the rest of your body out of whack.<br>  But you have not given, I would say, the medications enough time to take effect so therefore do what a lot of people do when they feel great for months on end.

Help yourself and let yourself and let your Mom help you out with this, o.k.?  You need a high vegetable/fruit, nut, grain and complex carbohydrate diet.

At the same time, you need to drink pure water, get plenty fresh air and sunshine and exercise to toleration at this time.  Good luck as you and your Mom read my website for several avenues to great health.

It depends on your insurance as to whether or not you need a referral.  Typically only Medicaid always requires a direct referral.  Whatever your regular health insurance is, you'd have to ask your primary care physician if it is necessary.

I think you should go to the doctor, get a test done for lactose intolerance to make sure you have it, and then go from there?

aDAmVyrIaa	why did you take 4 at the same time?!  thats dangerous! just keep throwing up and drink lots of water to flush your system.|`|nAp688tZaa	Why would you even think to take four of these at once if you have never used them before?  The reason you got sick is because vicodin can make you nauseous and then on top of that, you took 4 at once.  Of course you got sick.  You need to take this medication as prescribed.  I know for a fact that the doctor did not write the prescription for you to take 4 at a time.  For the 5/500 hydrocodone/apap the max number of pills in 24 hours is 8, which means that you can take 2 pills no less than every 6 hours.  You need to eat something right now and try to get your blood sugar back up and get your stomach to calm down.  About an hour after you have eaten and not had an episode of vomiting, then you can take the medication again, exactly as prescribed by your doctor.|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	You have acute poisoning from the acetaminophen.  You are still in Phase I, and your reaction is pretty severe, so it's likely that your symptoms will continue to get worse over the next day or two.  It's too late to prevent liver damage, but hospital treatment can limit the damage if you get there  as soon as you can.  <br>  <br>  There is no way to guess what will happen to you at this point - you may feel fine fine tomorrow and suffer only minor liver damage, or you might be dead in a couple of days from now if you don't get to the hospital. <br>  <br>  Call the poison control center for advice:  1-800-222-1222|`|bQ4RAi07aa	You can take Vicodin with or without food. However, if it upsets your stomach, you should take it with food. <br>  <br>  Do not take more than five to eight tablets in a 24-hour period, depending on the strength of your dose. <br>  <br>  The maximum dose of hydrocodone, one of Vicodin's two main ingredients is 60 mg/day. The maximum dose of acetaminophen, Vicodin's other main ingredient, is 4000 mg/day. <br>  <br>  If you forget to take a dose of Vicodin, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. If it is, then skip the dose you forgot and go back to your normal schedule. Never take two doses at the same time. <br>  <br>  Your doctor will prescribe the dose that he or she thinks is best for you. Do not use more or less than your doctor tells you to. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you got it out of your system when you threw up.  Please take them as your dr. prescribes you could really hurt your liver if you take more or even endanger your life.  Check with your dr on any medical advice given.|`|dHg78Phdaa	4 was way too much. Try eating soup and drinking water to flush your system out. Later when your feeling all better in your stomach, try one with a heavy meal.

Sozc3MyFaa	Your parents are over using the antiseptic wash at this point (although I am not sure an answer on YA is going to change them); because the wash is now killing off the new cells that are trying to grow in.  The latest guidelines from the Academy of ER docs recommends nothing more caustic than soap and water at the injury, then keep it dry for 48 hours to allow the skin to start healing.  At this point, antibiotic cream is enough and start exposing it to air to start scabbing. Hard to predict healing time with out actually seeing it.  To swim, I would try for a water proof dressing; you don't want a soggy dressing--if it does get wet, change it ASAP.

xnZi0i8saa	In order for it to be bipolar disorder you have to have the "ups" or hypomania in addition to the depression. Anti depressants can cause hypomania but you do not have any of those symptoms, just the depression. Maybe Zoloft is not the right medication for you. See your doctor and ask about trying a different medication. If you are really worried about being bipolar mention it to your doctor..... only a psychiatrist or psychologist can diagnose bipolar, your regular doctor cannot do it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

hcKoFZ3Daa	Keep on playing basketball and running. Weights are muscle strength not cardio.|`|y2Uks58paa	yeah most likely. lifting weights helps stamina some but not near as much as cardio|`|axUpa0mtaa	Cardio is definitely a must. I've been lifting weights for several years now, on & off, and i used to play football back in high school and basketball in middle school. To have better stamina and endurance requires a great amount of cardio on a regular basis. You dont have to run 5 miles everyday or something, but you can go running for a good 30 to 45 minutes at least 3 times a week. This will definitely help you out. Potassium is also a good source to intake to prevent cramping. i.e. bananas...I used to be in the Marines a few years back and I noticed the difference in my strength and speed after a few months. Hope this helps out. Semper Fi.
B1lNqtA3aa	I just got mine for the first time this morning, I'll tell you the whole thing in detail.<br>  <br>  You sit on the medical cot/table, and scoot yourself all the way to the edge. You have to put your feet on either side of the table in these stirrups, and then lie back. You're going to have to take a few deep breaths, they do this to relax you. The doctor then inserts this tong-like plastic six inch tube (it's honestly not as bad as it sounds), about the width of your two fingers. Then, he/she opens the tong-like tube inside you, it makes a click, click, click sound. They do this stretch you a little, in order to take some sample out from the walls. Don't worry, the doctor will constantly ask you if you're okay and they'll be gentle. The doctor takes a cotton swab, and brushes the inside of your walls to take the sample, pain-free, might feel a little funny. Then after, you might feel a little pinch, I think it's because they take a little skin sample. <br>  <br>  Mostly, it's not so bad, it's just uncomfortable. Everyone's sensitivity is different though. I thought it hurt a little when she opened the tube inside me, I didn't like the stretching feeling. Really though, it's going to be fine! Don't psych yourself out. Good luck:)|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	<a href="http://www.carepathonline.com/Topic.aspx?Nav=0&Rel=187" rel="nofollow">http://www.carepathonline.com/Topic.aspx...</a><br>  <br>  Great website you will be alright!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8pw8qDjPaa	I used to have a period that bad too and when i finally got on birth control it got sooo much more tolerable!<br>  <br>  Pap smears really aren't that bad! I was 15 when i had my first one and I was also a virgin. I was nervous as could be. It hurt a bit my first time but the doctor was really good about stopping and making sure she could make me as comfortable as she could... she also suggested I start wearing tampons and that would help in the future. But mainly it was just a little awkward having a metal instrument shoved up your vagina. lol! Then after that they just take a quick swab for a sample and its done. It's pretty quick though and once its over you'll probably be surprised that it wasnt that bad. The first time is the worst. After that it just becomes routine and you'll be fine.|`|xQsMPtFGaa	it doesnt hurt. its a little uncomfortable when they swab the inside of you. it takes like 5 minutes. dont be worried at all. i was 18 when i had my first pap and its no biggy. i just had another one last month too. dont let something so little scare you...youre going to be doing this till you die.|`|a3bq277Gaa	It's going to hurt whenever they stick these scissor like things inside of you. It hurt me, and I was sexually active.<br>  They take these big q-tip like things, and get samples from inside you. That's about it. It doesn't last too long.|`|M21c8MQ9aa	I am an obstetrician, so my answer can be trusted<br>  The Pap smear is done during a pelvic exam. A doctor uses a device called a speculum to widen the opening of the vagina so that the cervix can be examined. A plastic spatula and small brush are used to collect cells from the cervix. After the cells are taken, they are placed into a solution. The solution is sent to a lab for testing. A Pap smear is not painful, but the pelvic exam may be a little uncomfortable. <br>  It may take several weeks to get the test results. If you haven't heard from your doctor's office after 3 weeks, give them a call to see if your results have come back. A normal Pap smear means the cells from the cervix look normal. An abnormal Pap smear means the cells do not look normal. Sometimes repeat Pap smears are needed. Different tests also may need to be done, such as a colposcopy (the use of a special microscope to examine the cervix and vagina). Pap smears can occasionally show signs of infection but cannot be relied on to screen for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Other tests are necessary to determine the presence of an STD.There are several things you can do to help make the Pap smear as accurate as possible. These include avoidance of sex, douching, and vaginal creams for 48 hours before the test. An abnormal Pap smear does not necessarily mean that cancer cells were found during the examination. There are many causes for abnormal Pap smear results. Your doctor will evaluate the results to determine if further testing is necessary. A repeat Pap smear may be necessary if you had an infection at the time of the test or if there were not enough cells collected during the test. Since decreased levels of the female hormone estrogen also can influence Pap smear results, menopausal women may need to take estrogen before they repeat the test.<br>  <br>  If the results of the repeat Pap smear are still abnormal, your doctor may recommend that you have a colposcopy to further evaluate the problem.|`|Qri6T5pqaa	It's not that bad...can be a little uncomfortable but not painful.

If results do not improve, see a doctor.|`|srjPOxW7aa	Candida and caffeine are not a good mix , nor alcohol or sugar.<br>  as far as the poop goes, get some Barlean's flaxseed oil 100% organic kind. wouldn't hurt to drink prune juice (uuuhk I know) either.<br>  As far as the antibiotics always take pro biotics while taking them.<br>  and Yogurt too! it's super good for you when your taking antibiotics, for all those live cultures.|`|4nmLPk44aa	I am on the candida diet right now. its intense, If you want to get rid of candida, you meed to do the diet, go on the internet, I have had no fruit no sugar,bread,yeast,dairy. etc. for the last 2 weeks on mon I get to have bread(yeast free) and fruit, I feel so good!!! this lasts for a month, and you have to do it right for it to work!! good luck You can try psyllium powder, its the best for constipation or diarrhea, stops them both!!

mSjglSI6aa	I'd try to get into the women's clinic.  I suspect your hormones may be messed up.  There is tissue wanting to get out via menstruation, but it isn't happening.  <br>  <br>  Some things to try -take a calcium/magnesium supplement.  This can help reduce pain during menstruation, maybe it will help now too.  Magnesium deficiency usually goes hand in hand with estrogen dominance.  But, it sounds like maybe your body is producing too much progesterone - which keeps you from having a period so you can carry a child to term, keep regulated, etc.  <br>  <br>  You can ask for a saliva hormone test.  That is a pretty good picture of what is happening.  There are other ways to test, but from what I hear, this is the most effective.  Don't let the doctors treat you like you are just complaining - or depressed (another sign of estrogen dominance btw).  You want to get this fixed, and you are the one with the money.  So, be firm.  <br>  <br>  October is a long time to wait.  You may even want to check online for estrogen dominance Yahoo Groups and get some info from there.  You should also be able to find a do-it-yourself saliva test somewhere.  <br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon.|`|qLuodu3Raa	yes you should try to get in you may have cysts or something keep going until you find one that will do something for you|`|hPVKMD4Iaa	Maybe it's plugged or something?  Something is seriously wrong, though.<br>  Maybe go to the drug store and get some Midol...take some of that to help with the cramps.<br>  Get in the doctor, it'll be a good thing.<br>  Sure you're not pregnant?  Hmm, this is very weird.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|fNIDRpj8aa	Could be an Ovarian Cyst. They cause cramps, and weight gain/inability to lose weight. It can also affect your periods. Most are benign and disappear by themselves, but others have to be surgically removed.<br>  You should go into the Doctor and have them do an ultrasound of your uterus.|`|WLf4ny64aa	Hm interesting I'm not quite sure without talking to you more.  Sorry I can't be more helpful.  I don't think its depression related.  If you want to talk I'm online.
mh0QRDE9aa	What is good for one person may not be good for another.  Your genetics will determine what you should weight, not any insurance charts that we are judged by!!  You could be 200 lbs and be healthy or you could be 200 lbs and be sick.

But i know that if a depressed 14 year old girl has short hair, mild acne and wears glasses... its gunna pass. This is only an awkward stage, everything about your body will change so much, it'll shock you, i promise. As for the bad self asteem, i can almost definetly say that it's due to the abuse and not the physical. It sounds more like you just don't feel loved. But just hang in there, one day you'll have a family of your own, who will love you for exactly what you are.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Self esteem/confidence is addressed in section 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Acne treatments; see section 13. Some advice, and options: Volunteer, even from home, at first, to provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I... (insert activity here)..". Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated; there are many options; one is sure to suit you. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies. <br>  <br>  Accept that you, too are just a human being, with the frailties, insecurities, and tendency to err, occasionally, that the rest of us have. That is the beginning of self love, self acceptance, and self esteem. Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary.<br>  <br>  Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Make a list of all your good points, strengths, and achievements. Put it somewhere so you can easily refer to it, from time to time; perhaps on the refrigerator door, or print it; (large typeface, or capitalise) have it framed, and place in your bedroom, or in a position of prominence, such as on the television, or lounge room wall. Practise one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Section 53 at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/self confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself".|`|wBwuQB00aa	i have struggled with these problems, i try to fit in, and a lot of times i do, but every once in a while someone will give me a dirty look and say 'you're just a big bunny', and i feel like i dont fit in|`|DZWSIUtsaa	I know a friend that went to a hospital once because she was anorexic. She gained weight but she still wasn't cured of her anorexia. Her psychiatrist suggested she looked at herself in the mirror everyday for 30 minutes saying she's beautiful. It helped her a lot. Remember, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the people who called you ugly probably aren't that great.

QQbSIrBxaa	This sounds interesting.  Usually I would say this is a bad idea because drinking hot chocolate would just be adding empty calories to your diet, but if it is curbing your desire to eat salty and sweet snacks I say go for it.  I would after a while start switching water for some of the hot chocolates and slowly move so you are drinking just water too.|`|PwxmrBm9aa	To stop you from snacking you need filling meals. I would recommend that with every meal, have at least two cupfuls of fruit or veg. Most fruit & veg are very low in calories and 10% of the calories we consume are used up during digestion. Hopefully making your meals more filling will stop you from snacking, or maybe you could swap the chocolate and crisps for cereal bars and rice cakes?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|SDQdoVJ3aa	You question if "this" routine is better than "that" routine. From the details you have given this is impossible to answer. What you need to do is rely on the nutritional facts. Compare the calories and fat grams in your food and drink with each other. Lower is always better. <br>  <br>  Challenge yourself with this; incorporate as many fruits and vegetables into your diet as possible and drink a ton of water. Add one extra physical activity into each day that you normally don't do, such as parking further away.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Here is to your better health!!|`|8SRjELNBaa	Next... try hot-water & tea.... essentially your just filling yourself up with water.  However, hot chocolate is nice, if it works for you then roll with it. If you want to lose more calories drink ICE COLD WATER.

R7VjuCT2aa	Funny you ask this question when you did because I'm just getting over the stomach flu last week. It sucks so bad. I couldn't sleep and tossed and turned all night while my damn stomach felt like it had about 10 knives inside of it.<br>  <br>  My mom wanted me to go to the ER but as you now know it's a complete waste of time. It just takes time for it to run it's course and the ER is notorious for making you suffer hours upon hours just to get a person to see you.

afJz77pjaa	Yeah. I get like this right before my period. It's quite annoying actually.|`|NTVmU6Xbaa	Are you about to start your period?|`|NSARVXkMaa	For thousand of years, South African bushmen (known as ‘San people’) have relied on the hoodia plant during long hunting trips. By chewing on it they could fight off hunger whilst sustaining energy levels. These properties make it ideal for helping weight loss by curbing cravings and suppressing snacking. Whenever you eat, levels of ‘glucose’ (energy stored as sugar) in your body rise. This triggers a message in part of your brain to say you are full. Hoodia contains a molecule that is about 10,000 times as active as glucose. This means it can trick your brain into thinking your stomach is full - even if you skip a meal! An early hoodia trial showed a calorie reduction of up to 1,000 a day and was described as a ‘stunning success.’ Now the western world is hungry for more of this weight loss wonder. Rest assured, unlike many other Hoodia products on the market, Healthy Direct's Hoodia Gordonii 400mg is made in a factory which holds a pharmaceutical manufacturing license: this is granted by the Danish Medicines Authority (who are amongst the most exacting agencies in the EU) and has recognition throughout Europe.  Desert Burn hoodia helped me lose 33 pounds with little to no effort.  Honestly!!!
qpXPJ1pLaa	Try with small things, then work your way up. One of the best things you can do is get into a habit of running daily. Even if you start out jogging slowly for short distances, getting into this habit will lead to being able to go for longer distances at greater speeds and get you overall fit. Another thing you can try is doing planks and other ab workouts. Good workouts would include crunches and sit-ups, maybe even using various types of ab-bars at a gym. Planks are when you lay horizontally, face down, then lift your body up using your elbows and toes for support (the goal is to have your body straight as a 'plank'). If you do these two basic things, you will become very fit. If you can get up to doing 4 minutes of plank a day (broken up into convenient intervals) then you will become very fit because these work your quads, abs and biceps. Good luck<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|zB7Gz8R5aa	I would recommend getting on a balanced diet (don't starve yourself of anything, not one food group nor all food groups).<br>  <br>  Exercise daily. Maybe only half an hour to an hour a day. Mix it up a bit, run some days, do things like sit ups and leg lifts other days. Mostly because a little bit of muscle will make you look a lot thinner than you are so you will see results faster, but you won't get lighter as muscle weighs more, but it is dense so you will be thinner.<br>  <br>  Also, try to drink as much water as possible. Give up sodas all together and stick to real fruit juice and water water water (as it will make you healthier, give you more energy, and help to burn the body fat you are trying to get rid of) The juice is just because sometimes it's nice, and fruit is still good for you and some natural sugar is good in your diet.<br>  <br>  Most importantly: Be happy with yourself. We don't all look the same, we might want to look like other people, but one of the most attractive things that you might not realize until later in life is just confidence and happiness. Since you are 15 there will be a lot of young boys going through what they think is the whole process of wanting actress like women. But while you are working on getting there just be comfortable and happy with yourself and later when you are looking for that guy to marry it will be a lot easier as he will be looking for someone stable, happy, and confident in her self.|`|8oBi8KiIaa	Ok...well first off NEVER DIET.<br>  Diets don't work.<br>  You just have to eat right.<br>  You should start watching your calorie intake.<br>  You should only consume around 1500 calories per day or less.<br>  And you have to watch your sugar intake...because sugar directly turns into fat.<br>  And you should join a dance class.<br>  Dancing is one of the easiest ways to burn calories and you can have fun while you do.<br>  And you also don't have to run to lose weight.<br>  Walking is actually just as efficent.<br>  You only have to walk 2 mi + per day and you will be in shape.<br>  It's really not that much.<br>  And just remember...you don't lose weight over night.<br>  It's a daily process.<br>  Results will probably really start showing after a month.<br>  I hope you get what you're looking for (:|`|smdYwFfRaa	I'm guessing you don't exercise at the moment - so start doing cardio. Go for jogs or long speedy walks around your neighbourhood, or join a gym (although I would recommend the first option), much cheaper and gyms can be a bit depressing.<br>  Start eating 5 times a day. Have a healthy breakfast like wholegrain cereal or fruit and yoghurt, and have a healthy sandwhich for lunch or some fruit and then in the afternoon have some fruit or some raw vegetables and then for dinner have something like rice or pasta. You don't need to go on a silly low-carb diet, just use portion control.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7ciDto6Daa	Hun you're not that bad.<br>  Your not fat, your just alittle over weight over that's all.<br>  If you feel so bad about your body, then just exercise. Maybe do some cardio for about 30 mins a day. Or go running. or swimming. Count your calories.

The only really way to loose weight and keep it off is by diet and exercise. Cardio is the best way to loose weight, especially an elliptical machine, it has all the benefits of running but less wear and tear on your knees and ankles. If you don't want to eat as much then drink plenty of water and if your afraid of over eating then rule of thumb is don't eat until you actually feel your stomach rumble, that way to eat when your body tells you that its time to eat not when you think you have to eat. Try eating meals that are high in protein but low in carbs. Tuna is a good food to eat when trying to loose weight, high in protein, low fat, and has omega 3.|`|lBbe6JCKaa	To break a fast without gaining the weight back, try eating one slice of apple today and tomorrow, two for the next couple of days, etc. It should take about another week to completely break it. <br>  <br>  Warning: You may get acid, so carry some Tums with you.|`|cik8brUsaa	eat lots of unhealty food for a week then eat only cabbage for therre weeks it works i lost 29kgs|`|iFXe1Obvaa	That's a bad way to lose weight - you'll gain it all back plus MORE.<br>  <br>  AHH!!|`|zTeW6BIIaa	erm... a hamburger? eat whatever you want.|`|K3YKF9fBaa	Are you serious I can't go a day without food.

All you basically have to do is exercise. Run, Jump-rope, do cardio in the nighttime or in the morning whichever you perfer.

zMD0VeOmaa	no. it depends on the size of the bagel but the average bagel is 4 exchanges of starch. An exchange of starch is 15gm carbohydrate. Their are 4 calorie per gram of carbohydrate. So each exchange of starch has 60 calories. 60 calories x 4=240 calories.<br>  <br>  Of course, this does not include cream cheese added to the bagel. A teaspoon of full fat cream cheese or a tablespoon of reduced fat cream cheese will add an exchange of fat, which is 5gm. A gram of fat has 9 calories. So by adding an exchange of fat to the bagel you add 45 calories for a total of 285 calories. The total calorie level of the bagel will vary depending on the type and amount of cream cheese added.<br>  <br>  From a nutritional perspective it is best to eat bagels with whole grains and reduced fat cream cheese. It is recommended to make at least half your grains whole. Reduced fat cream cheese has less saturated fat, which can raise LDL cholesterol and increase risk for cardiovascular disease.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Some huge ones, with cream cheese could top 1000...|`|jw6Lpt37aa	the true story is here <a href="http://annecollins.com/calories/calories-bagels.htm" rel="nofollow">http://annecollins.com/calories/calories...</a>|`|4d3Md9pnaa	hell no.<br>  if you're eating ones from bags, check the bag.<br>  if you're eating one from a bakery or something, if it's a big chain, they should have the nutritional info on their website.<br>  <br>  (None of Panera's bagels are 1000 calories...hell, Panera's salads have more calories. xD )|`|7ciDto6Daa	No, the bagels I eat have 260 calories. Plus when I put cream cheese on it. Its alot more with cream cheese.|`|dFmmFub5aa	No,lol, i just checked our bagels and the plain ones have 260 calories each.|`|Q7ALl9zeaa	Probably 300 to 400 calories with nothing on it. A serving is a half of a full size bagel. I would choose one that has very high fibre. I prefer silver hills flax bagels, they have 8 grams of fibre per serving. Not sure if you can buy them where you are, but they have good quality ones in every grocer. It is important to look at the actual serving size of packages, it can be very deceiving.|`|WCsy7CQHaa	yes, well it depends. But mostly yes, by the time you add all the fating cream cheese. . or butter. . or whatever you put on your bagel. It will equal some insanely high calories.|`|ZxJ4SL90aa	No, it's more like 400-500 calories.<br>  I read somewhere that eating a bagel is as equal to eating 7 pieces of bread :|<br>  I think it adds up!|`|KcooLtkCaa	no.<br>  the average bagel has been 300 to 400 calories.|`|26pGJRhwaa	each Bagels has 300 calories.|`|9WKVmOs1aa	go look at the bag.<br>  but u should only be eating one half of it....or one of the mini bagels.|`|vx1SsXw2aa	No!|`|i2QaFunfaa	no|`|LY1k1xvLaa	Most of them do have about 700 calories but you can find a select few that may have like 300.

It's not an uncommon problem.  Nurses n doctors see it all the time.  I work in the health office of a large fire dept, where big tough firefighters get blood drawn everyday, and we do get some who pass out.  It happens.<br>  <br>  As a paramedic, I put IV catheters in people all the time.  With an IV cath, only the soft plastic part stays in - the needle comes out.  Most who are OK with this do *not* like to have that blood donation needle stay in their arm.  Don't like it, but put up with it.<br>  <br>  So don't be hard on yourself.

Before HIV and AIDS, it included such diseases as gonorrhea, syphilis, and chancroid.  Syphilis has killed many famous people by brain or aorta damage.  Both sexes can get them.  Gonorrhea can cause abnormal (ectopic) pregnancy in the girl's fallopian tubes or prostate swelling in guys.

So, yes.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The correct way to state your question would be as follows:  Will laser eye surgery correct astigmatism.  There should not be "an" before astigmatism.  That is because astigmatism is not a thing, it is a condition.  Similarly you would not say "I have A diabetes."

eFW5O92Yaa	First off, just wanted to say thank you for all the info, I hate it when people ask questions with pretty much absolutely no definitions.<br>  <br>  Anyways it still depends on your metabolism. Sometimes excercise will help speed it up and lose weight, with others it will stay the same and maybe lose only a few pounds. It does look like a good excercise routine, however you may want to change a few things in it every month or so just so you don't plateau (when your body adapts to the routine and quits progressing). If your body takes to it well I would say you will be able to drop down to your goal. If worst comes to worst, for the 3 months you might drop to 115 or so, however even though there's not much weight difference, you'll feel stronger and have more endurance.

h1eBWehMaa	maybe she is allergic to something|`|rcPnnfmmaa	I'm fairly sure that one of the things going on is that your friend has an idiot doctor.<br>  <br>  The throat swelling closed is a classic immune response. Reoccurring every night is also a good clue that it's immune system related because every night she probably sleeps on the same bed and gets exposed to the same set of potential triggers. Your friend has asthma.<br>  <br>  Tell her to try sleeping in a different house for one night to see if she gets some relief. It may also be something as simple as humidity which often changes at different times of the day.<br>  <br>  I wonder what kind of tests they did? Doctor's offices are very clean so listening to her chest and having her blow into a tube often reveal nothing.<br>  <br>  You can't give her an inhaler without a prescription. Don't let her use a friend's inhaler either because the wrong kind can be bad for her. If it ever gets so bad she can hardly breathe don't be afraid to call 911.

Heart failure has various degrees of severity. It's called congestive because the fluid collects in the tissues and lungs. Diuretics such as lasix help the body eliminate water build up.<br>  <br>  It's a long-term condition that tends to worsen over time. Often, by the time a person is diagnosed, the heart has slowly been losing pumping capacity for quite a long time.<br>  <br>  Medications can be prescribed to help with congestive heart failure. As scary as it sounds, you CAN live with congestive heart failure as long as you are getting proper medical care and taking your medications as prescribed. <br>  <br>  Good luck to your grandmother.

5F82CQ7Yaa	Well, is there any reason you don't want your new doctor to see your medical records? If you don't consent to release your records from the old doctor even if you do tell him that you are seeing a new doctor he can't show the new doc the records. The only way the new doc can see your med record is if you sign a consent form at your old doctor's place.|`|rYzxfrnnaa	Your new doctor will not know, unless you will volunteer this information.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	you better communicate to your old doctor so that you have the record for the preference of your new doctor
a92aaf69c31f3c24aa6470a18ea029d9aa	Birth control pills regulate your periods. But you get them like every 28 days.

B6ioLtejaa	Using warm or hot water is a myth. It is the soap that does the cleaning, the water is simply the vehicle used to wash away the waste materials. Also, using cold water is easier on your hands, they won't dry out as quickly.
YCmvBc05aa	Yes, you do need a new crown, otherwise the tooth inside will get decayed and you will end up losing the tooth.<br>  <br>  As a quick and cheaper solution you can ask the dentist to place a small filling in there for the time being.<br>  <br>  You can go back for the crown / cap later once you have the money.|`|qrGLcTh4aa	Did you have work done AFTER the crown was placed? Specifically a Root Canal? Because that was the case the Dr would have had to drill threw the crown at that point and fill the access made. If so, the restoration has broken down. 10 years is good amount of time for a crown to last. You got your money out of it. You just have to go to the Dentist and have it repaired(if they can) or replaced with a new one.<br>  You should go as soon as possible so you don't fracture the tooth beneath the crown or cause decay from happening. The tooth needs coverage.|`|3jBNSmvBaa	If your crown is porcelain (tooth colored) then you probably just fractured the porcelain and what your seeing is the metal underneath. If thats the case then its fine and you dont need to have it replaced immediately but if its gold or just plain metal you should see your dentist so they can take an xray to make sure you dont have any decay under your crown. <br>  Crown life expectancy is about 10 years and dental insurance will pay to have it replaced.
d5cd40a9a7f4215411f86af9ca4cea4eaa	yes the meds are literally making you better by regulating your seratonin levels.<br>  your life circumstances certainly also play a role and you need to keep working on addressing those areas as well too.<br>  all the best|`|rsYbDHWRaa	yes, they are making you better in a physical sense, but if you want to be able to get off them and STAY better, your going to need counseling to work out the issues that are making you depressed in the first place.

A lot more people take medication for it than one realizes and it is nothing to be ashamed of.  It is a body chemistry thing as well as an emotional thing.  It can be as simple as the blues to deep manic.  It is not anything to brush aside but take care of yourself.|`|wBwuQB00aa	i had it once, they used my mother to tell if a girl was pregnant, and the girl was and my mom died
AA12198742	If you are nervous here are my suggestions- <br>  <br>  There are tons of types and absorbancies and such that it can be mind boggling, but look for these tow things that are good "first try" factors:  <br>  <br>  Find a junior or light absorbancy, as they are meant to hold less and are therefore thinner/skinnier/smaller.<br>  <br>  Find a tampon with a plastic applicator, as they are smoother and will go in easier. (I am pretty sure Tampax Pearl is a smooth plastic applicator)<br>  <br>  When you try, just push a little, and if it hurts, stop. Usually if it goes a little bit it will slide the rest of the way in without too much pressure. Make sure you read the info on the inside of the box- it actually is helpful if you haven't used a tampon before. Remember, you can always stop pushing if it hurts- though if you do it correctly is shouldn't be painful at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck and be brave!  Just think of how much easier life will be without pads!|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	genrally thinking that they dnt' hurt but i was wman when used them not young girl|`|7utsLRfyaa	i was like that<br>  but one day i was like "its now or never"<br>  went to loo, took a tampon with me, put it in right and it was absolutely fine!<br>  pads are so dirty although i use them on my light days<br>  :)|`|e3dad9cc3f217fc64b3369e29a929c0caa	Some are more comfortable than others to insert.  If you're nervous about trying tampons for the first time, try one with a plastic applicator such as Playtex Gentle Glide.  The first time I used a tampon I didn't insert it far enough, causing me to feel it the entire time I was wearing it - and taking it out while it was still dry did hurt, but I had to.  So just make sure you read through all the instructions before trying tampons for the first time.  When used properly they can be a great help.  Although I use 3 types of products (tampons, pads and InStead), I don't necessarily prefer one over the others - it depends on what I'm doing that day and what my flow is like.  I have friends that use only tampons, friends that use only pads, and others like me that choose depending on what's going on.  I tend to have soreness in my vaginal area during my period, so if that's the case I use a pad.<br>  <br>  One thing I always do after unwrapping the tampon is to grip the applicator and give a really strong tug on the cord.  Rarely, the cord will come off.  It's better to find out before inserting the tampon if the cord is going to come off!  I know someone who recently had to go to the hospital to have her tampon removed because the cord wasn't properly attached.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and don't be scared.|`|2uOhDMKjaa	No matter how much i tell you they dont hurt, your still gonna think that they hurt... lol at least i did. I was scared too, but it honestly feels like nothing if you do it right. In stead of me telling you how to use them... go get your box of tampons and read EVERYTHING! you will be so much less nervous, and you will know how everything is supposed to work... this is what i did. You will be fine... and it is not going to hurt... i cant stress this enough!|`|xQsMPtFGaa	no it doesnt hurt at all. if you dont do it right it can be a littl uncomfortable...but once its in the right way you forget its there. i forget alll the time.<br>  the easiest way is to stand with one foot on the toilet seat and insert it. point the tip perpendicular to your body so it goes in all the way. look at the directions in the box. i always read those.<br>  <br>  good luck. youll be fine!|`|LZXSOqnfaa	Yea, been there, done that.  I was a bit freaked too...<br>  Okay... there are instructions in the tampon box for you to follow.<br>  Be sure to read all of the instructions.<br>  They are probably sitting at the bottom of the box...<br>  The key is to relax and do it slowly.<br>  Your friends are right.  Once it's in there, it feels like nothing.<br>  Just remember to remove it in 4 to 8 hours after you put it in.<br>  After you use a tampon a couple of times, then you will be okay with it!<br>  <br>  For the steps, wash your hands before you use a tampon.<br>  Take it out of the package. <br>  Sit on the toilet with your legs apart.<br>  Take the tampon to the entrance, point it in the direction of your lower back, and gently slide it in. <br>  When the upper applicator tube is in, use your finger to push the lower tube into the upper tube of the tampon applicator.<br>  When the tampon is sitting inside, you remove the applicator and dispose of it.<br>  <br>  There are strings that hang out of you which are used to remove the tampon.<br>  To take it out, sit on the same position on the toilet with your legs spread, grab the strings and gently pull it out.<br>  <br>  It won't hurt if you are relaxed!  You will be okay!  :o)|`|QuighYdGaa	hunni it dosnt hurt at all<br>  <br>  they are a lot more reliable than pads as if the pad is put on wrong or if your doing sports it wont work!!!!<br>  <br>  there should be a peice of paper in the tampon box telling you how to insert it.<br>  <br>  you will be fine and you cant feel the tampon at all once its inserted and da gr8 thing with tampons is you can still wear g-strings when you have you period!!!|`|t4IHsRXBaa	okay.... <br>  it doesnt hurt unless u put it up farther than u need to. all u do is<br>  1. unwrap the tampon<br>  2. Sit or stand in a comfortable position. Some women prefer to place one leg on the toilet seat or tub, while others prefer to squat down. <br>  3.After you find a position that is most comfortable for you, hold the tampon with the fingers that you write with.<br>  4.Hold the middle of the tampon put it in ur vigina its called the "lips" <br>  5.with ur other hand push the part sticking out of ur vigina up.<br>  6. once inside remove the aplicator. <br>  *MAKE SURE U DONT FLUSH THE APLICATOR PUT IT IN THE WRAPPER THEN IN THE TRASH CAN* or it will clog the toilet.|`|vmXZy0kNaa	I just got mine (kinda, within two weeks) It doesnt hurt the first time, but I tried to put it in and when i missed, I would take it out and try again but after that, dANG IT FELT LIKE i WAS RIPPING MY INTESTINS OUT. Suposibly I was scratching the walls|`|V9e2jxbMaa	i was to i just statred it 3 weeks ago. it is amazing and so much better then useing a PAD try and if you dont like it dont use that simple.|`|RAEJAsa0aa	well at first they do hurt to put them in and take them out but after a while you get used to them and THEN afterwards they then do feel like they are not in at all.|`|HunGEQf9aa	if you put it in the right place it wont hurt. but you'll be able to feel it lol...

AA11020187	Although anything is possible, it isn’t very likely. From 1975 to 2000, less than 0.1% of all breast cancer occurred in women under 30 years of age. During this same period 1.3 in every 1 million 15- to 19-year-old females were diagnosed with breast cancer. Also chemo without surgical removal of the cancer is not a treatment option. It is not an either or situation.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	Paget's of the breast is a very rare disease. Only about 1 - 4% of females WITH breast cancer present with Paget's. Chances of having breast cancer at the age of 15 is so close to 0%, it's not considered. If you have a weepy, crusty sore on your breast, I can be confident it's something else less than cancer or Paget's.|`|AA10928446	Paget's disease is an extremely uncommon cancer. Based on your age and the rarity of the disease itself I would not jump to this diagnosis immediately. It is always possible to have cancer regardless of age but I wouldn't panic about this until you speak to your doctor. Pagets disease is usually the physical manifestation of an underlying cancer located within the breast itself. Most sufferers are over the age of 50 but I do believe there have been cases in women as young as their 20s. I personally have never ever heard of a woman in her early teens being diagnosed with Paget's disease.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Normally, no. It's a bit like being struck by lightning. Do you have a history of breast cancer in your family? Does anyone else in your community have cancer?<br>  <br>  This is far from impossible and your doctor will tell you so even if it's not Paget's, but for reference if impossible things happen that means they were never quite impossible all along. Many of the most important observations in science have narrowly avoided being ignored because they just didn't make any sense at all.|`|52cGZS3caa	In this world dear, everything is possible but, if we spent our time worrying about all the possible bad things that could happen we wouldn't have a life at all! Please don't let yourself worry about something that is so very unlikely. Wait for the doctors visit and keep thinking the opposite of what you are doing. You do not have cancer and you are not going to get it. That is the only way to approach it! Stay positive.

CE4K7kQvaa	Attention Defecit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) :-<br>  <br>  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a condition that becomes apparent in some children in the preschool and early school years. It is hard for these children to control their behavior and/or pay attention.<br>  <br>  ADHD - CAUSE<br>  <br>  Most substantiated causes appear to fall in the realm of neurobiology and genetics. This is not to say that environmental factors may not influence the severity of the disorder, but such factors do not seem to give rise to the condition by themselves.<br>  <br>  ADHD - SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS<br>  <br>  The principal characteristics of ADHD are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These symptoms appear early in a child's life. When the child's hyperactivity, distractibility, poor concentration, or impulsivity begin to affect performance in school, social relationships with other children, or behavior at home, ADHD may be suspected. But because the symptoms vary so much across settings, ADHD is not easy to diagnose. This is especially true when inattentiveness is the primary symptom. <br>  <br>  There are three subtypes of ADHD recognized by professionals. These are the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type (that does not show significant inattention); the predominantly inattentive type (that does not show significant hyperactive-impulsive behavior) sometimes called ADD—an outdated term for this entire disorder; and the combined type (that displays both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms).<br>  <br>  HOW DIAGNOSIS IS DONE for ADHD?<br>  <br>  Because everyone shows some of these behaviors at times, the diagnosis requires that such behavior be demonstrated to a degree that is inappropriate for the person's age. The diagnostic guidelines also contain specific requirements for determining when the symptoms indicate ADHD. The behaviors must appear early in life, before age 7, and continue for at least 6 months. Above all, the behaviors must create a real handicap in at least two areas of a person's life such as in the schoolroom, on the playground, at home, in the community, or in social settings. So someone who shows some symptoms but whose schoolwork or friendships are not impaired by these behaviors would not be diagnosed with ADHD. Nor would a child who seems overly active on the playground but functions well elsewhere receive an ADHD diagnosis.<br>  <br>  To assess whether a child has ADHD, specialists consider several critical questions: Are these behaviors excessive, long-term, and pervasive? That is, do they occur more often than in other children the same age? Are they a continuous problem, not just a response to a temporary situation? Do the behaviors occur in several settings or only in one specific place like the playground or in the schoolroom? The person's pattern of behavior is compared against a set of criteria and characteristics of the disorder as listed in the DSM-IV-TR.<br>  <br>  HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT for Attention Defecit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)<br>  <br>  Homeopathic medicines are known to have deep effect on human psychology and have been found effective in various mental and psychological disorders. The focus of homeopathy is not to treat the isolated symptoms of ADHD but to treat the child as a whole. Not only the symptoms of ADHD but also the general physical and mental constitution of the patient, past medical history, medical history of parents, information about pregnancy and vaccination - all are used to find the probable cause in a given case and based on the final analysis a remedy is chosen for a patient. The following medicines may help in the treatment of ADHD -<br>  <br>  ADHD - CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT<br>  <br>  The conventional treatment primarily uses a class of drugs known as stimulants (amphetamines). <br>  <br>  WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?<br>  <br>  You can join various support groups. Behavioural therapy, Social-skills training, Parenting skills training, Psychotherapy can be useful for the patient and the family.<br>  <br>  REFERENCE WORKS<br>  <br>  Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 14th ed, McGraw-Hill<br>  <br>  Davidson's Principles and Practise of Medicine, 17th ed, 1996, Churchill Livingstone<br>  <br>  New Manual of Homeopathic Materia Medica & Repertory, William Boericke, 2nd revised ed., 2001, B.

I don't think so.... coz... we have a saying that... 'eyes were made for seeing, then beauty has its own excuse for being'...<br>  <br>  Though, staring to someone is really annoying....especially to that 'someone' you are staring at. The act of staring is mostly misinterpreted...Whether its a malicious one or not... still can be considered...annoying.<br>  <br>  In my opinion... looking  and staring has different meaning... if you are only looking ..without any malice...

When my treatment is over, I will have space for 2 implants.  Implants are considered cosmetic in nature.  The answer to your question is, NO!|`|qrGLcTh4aa	Typically no.

This seems to be rather odd, and looks to have its roots in your childhood. It sounds like your parents are trying to instill the thought into you that the subject of human sexuality is evil. But, since it sounds like it is too late to change, you should turn to video games. Video games steer your mind from ALL impulses. Sometimes, I even forget to eat.

At 9 years old I had to move far away from my mother and I cried every night for a year. Then when I was 14 years old, my mom died suddenly. I also left home at 17 and my dad said, " Don't let the screen door hit your *** on the way out." I was very naive and the world was nothing like I thought it was. I tried suicide twice, had terrible relationships and became an alcoholic. All I need was someone to talk to, just like you. Write a letter to your dad and explain what is going on and how you miss him. Then remind him of how you love him and know in your heart that he is there for you in spirit. Ask for his help when you need it. Re-build a relationship that ended much to soon. We all have to find ways to comfort ourselves in a world for dissapointment and pain. See if you can help out around the house so you feel like you are part of your sister's family. She wants you to be independent and is willing to help you get there. It is possible to to turn a frown into a smile again. Don't give in to harming yourself. It is time for healing and helping. You have my support in my prayers. Carry on young man.|`|m3WBUa3Uaa	im so sorry! :( <br>  <br>  i could never imagine what that must feel like. just stay strong. maybe you should see a therapist to help you get through your problem. dont end up commiting suicide because of your pain.. that just makes things worse.<br>  <br>  your dad is in a better place and hes looking down on you right now <br>  & just wants you to be happy.<br>  and even though its super hard to deal with,<br>  youll move on.. eventually.<br>  <br>  keep your chin up kid (:
KGppArcfaa	I think its just how you are. I have been sexually active for 7 years and to this day I have that problem too.<br>  Things that help are to have extra lube, and also make sure that you are ready, like lots of foreplay to make you into it.|`|arsAqGf7aa	You might just be tense for some reason.  Try a little extra lube like KY. Just put it on the head of his penis or around the opening to your vagina.|`|mAlvOFnWaa	I agree with Beth, try using more lube but if that doesn't work you can use a vaginal dilator set to gently help stretch your vagina to make sex a little more comfortable.

xnZi0i8saa	The symptoms of hypomania are different for everyone but in general you will see a higher energy level, increased sexuality, decreased need for sleep, more intense emotions....... your emotions may not necessarily be positive, just more intense. Even after starting treatment for bipolar you may still have mood swings..... it takes awhile for the meds to really stabilize you, sometimes even years and there can still be breakthrough depressins and mania's (or hypomanias). Talk to your doctor and see about tweeking your meds a bit.|`|G0zolaYMaa	go to this website chatroom.  they have a room called bipolar and ask others.<br>  RealMentalHealth.com|`|0QT8laMOaa	I understand exactly what you're going through. I talk to a therapist and all we do is talk. I also take my 2 year old son along with me. It has helped eminsly. At this point the father of my son walked out on us in October. He did not understand what having Bipolar was doing to me. I was trying to get help and I needed him to stand by my side and yet he stepped out of our lives. If you need someone to talk my messenger is jellbean2007. I can help you with the CRAZY days lol. My life is just starting to get normal.

HumMEMu5aa	What about focussing on the fact that even twenty years ago, having cancer was almost certainly a death sentence, and how things have improved in last 20 years.<br>  <br>  As a cancer patient, I have tried to write a lot of positive stuff on www.after-cancer.com - things get better every day.<br>  <br>  Verite R|`|QqY8YgGDaa	1-prevention of cancer<br>  2-enthusiasm even after getting cancer <br>  3-anything from your list|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Way too broad unless you want to talk for hours.<br>  <br>  1.  Cancer is many diseases - all related by the fact that it involves cells mutating and growing out of control and causing problems with different organs in the body.<br>  <br>  2.  Different cancers have different causes - some are lifestyle or environmentally related (smoking, diet, obesity, exposure to chemicals), some are genetic (such as some forms of breast cancer), and some are caused by viruses (such as HPV in cervical cancer).  Sometimes causes aren't known.  Talk about cancer prevention.<br>  <br>  3.  Treatments for cancer and how they vary depending on type of cancer and the goal (curing the patient or keeping it in remission and extending life).<br>  <br>  4.  Some cancers are very curable and others are not.  Survivability is directly related to early detection and tests for early detection.  The cancers that are most fatal (lung, ovarian and pancreatic for example) are because early detection is difficult and so many people have advanced stage cancer before it is detected.

d29M7lGKaa	Haven't you heard the old saying about having sex,, " Like lets go bump uglys", they are all ugly, why do you think women hide them !!!!|`|44BEm1Uhaa	All vagina's are nice to look at....hehe|`|iFTa9FqZaa	thats kinda what vaginas are like. the red dots are razor burn b/c it is so sensitive, i would recommend either trimming or waxing.|`|DErBSfZgaa	OVERREACTION. besides vaginas were'nt meant to be pretty.<br>  <br>  they are ALWAYS a different color then your skin. <br>  their either pinkish or purple-ish black. and i think you prefer pink right?<br>  <br>  and maybe it's because your too skinny and your inner lips appear<br>  to be bigger since you have no fat on the outer ones.<br>  <br>  try using shaving cream after you shave and that'll prevent the red dots.<br>  hope i help :)|`|W6wamWLLaa	hahaaahaa there not mean t to look ni8ce|`|K5SGG1QYaa	vaginas are pink and reddish, like the inside of your mouth. infact, traditionally, a pink vagina is seen as more attractive that a brown/flesh coloured one. although obviously both are normal and healthy and fine.<br>  <br>  its normal and healthy for there to be a light scent. if your 'not sure if its bad' then its not, if it smells stronglu unpleasant then obviously thats not good, but its nothing more rigorous personal hygene can't handle. if you're worried about it, then just use the bathroom before you have sex ie when you get into the house and just have a quick wash with soap and water.<br>  <br>  the inner lips have a lot of variation, big, small, long, short, thin fat, wavy, straight, symmetrical, unsymetrical, its all fine. seriously, i;m sure theyr normal.<br>  <br>  EVERYONE has pubes lol. they are totally normal, they may not look great but we all have them theyre normal not weird or ugly. try using shaving gel, a new razor, exfoliating, and using lotion after, it really helps with shaving irritation (which, by the way, everyone gets, i dont know anyone who doesnt get razor rash lol)<br>  <br>  its not ugly, its just a vagina. to be honest, its quite a small part of the body and its not that visable, even during sexual situations. that sounds weird, but unless hes licking you out he will probably never get a god look at your vagina. plus guys love them, they crave them, they dont see an ugly vulva, they see a hole they want to pu their penis in, seriously.<br>  <br>  you really don't need to worry, i'm sure you're normal. nearly everyone worrys about these things, but you really shouldnt :)|`|wydxVDpQaa	I kind of have the same thing, its the bit in the middle i think is quite big and it hangs out quite a bit. You're normal.|`|8nRVVuoKaa	Trust me - guys don't care what it looks like downstairs, as long as they can get some. And seriously, have you ever looked at a penis or a scrotum? I'd hardly call either of those 'handsome'.|`|GAyy1wBgaa	It's how they feel on the inside when aroused that counts, dear.|`|FP6JMvlTaa	How can you ask this when you said and i quote: <br>  <br>  "Vaginas are a beautiful work of art. And every single one is different."<br>  <br>  ....on someone Else's question?  take own advice and stop asking questions just to be funny.  you already know all vaginas are different and unique.

31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	This happens because you most likely do not have a foreskin.  So it has no choice, but for thoses that do have one it wicks out to the sides of the skin through a process known as capillary action.<br>  <br>  This is why uncut males often do not have this problem unless they did not shake enough.  Also - many males don't shake enough.  The reason is that there is a likeness to jerking off in this action and no male wants other males to think that this is what they are doing.<br>  <br>  The Physics of all this is that uncut males do not require underwear at all.  Its a child's garment intended to prevent leaking in the normal world.   Many full grown males that are not cut will go commando do this reason.  Its simply not needed.<br>  <br>  Cut males will suffer greatly as their head  rubs against cloths of which jeans can be the hardest to deal with.  So in this case undies are required.  If the cut male goes commando he will increase the rate of damage already in progress.<br>  <br>  Most older males that did suffer the knife end up almost without any feeling by middle age.  Going commando could make this reality come a lot sooner, and so its is never recommended for them.<br>  <br>  Your Most Complete Answer.|`|ed5ab56655d3bbdc69fef2077fe983b5aa	true. i hate this so much. even if you use toilet paper to dry it. glad im not the only one!|`|jlZxZmaNaa	True|`|MAdFY7Vlaa	yep it's true.it'hs happened to me plenty of times.|`|6GEEwjwzaa	its all true|`|6hRpeuBVaa	true. its so annoying!|`|0U4UFuVqaa	Hmm, since I don't bother so much (you gotta change the underwear anyways) this happens to me most of the time. It kind of depends on what type of pants you're wearing and how much you peed.<br>  If you're dehydrated, then there probably won't be any spare urine. ;o most of the time it happens when I pull my junk back in, the waistline of the pants squeeze the pee out... what embarrassing topic! <br>  <br>  Since I've already gone there, there worse is when your aim is off and you never realized it until the damage has been done!|`|j4ETkTTGaa	true and false somtimes it does and sometimes it dosent|`|m5mrs5hRaa	YES!<br>  This has been happening to me recently.

The cold in the icecream soothed it for a short while because it just numbed the pain, but it'll return, and probably worse.  Try to get some cool orange juice instead and if it continues either take some cold medicine (not medicine that's cold, but medicines for the cold virus) or go see a doctor.

Rk46lIBwaa	I love it when people ask about Adios, which is of course worthless as a weight loss aid. It means I get another chance to make my Adios joke. <br>  <br>  Adios to ￡s but not to lbs!<br>  <br>  In fact of course as you would find from the other 50,000 weight loss questions already on Answers that you might like to browse though, your only worthwhile option is<br>  <br>  DIET + EXERCISE|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	It won't work, there is only one way to lose weight- diet + exercise. The pills are a complete waste of time and money. At the end of it, the only thing that will be lighter is your purse.|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  <br>  I don't think it will help with weight loss.<br>  <br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|5KcUyLFRaa	personally i'm wary of all diet pills. Adios contains a strong duretic..which will reduce water retention which can account to a great deal of weight loss but isn't always the healthiest of ways to reduce weight. If you do take them make sure you account for fluids lost by drinking lots of water. <br>  Why not just slightly reduce you calorie content, commit to an hours vigorous exercise 5times a week and try weight training (muscle burns more fat than pills)|`|lcXtN4aLaa	I'v tried them and they didnt really work for me, i felt that they made my skin breakout and didnt speed my rate of weightloss up, i was still losing the same amount with exercise, but everyone will react differently i suppose.|`|2pi1H46Vaa	My Girlf has. She says they suck. She also recommends the NSC national slimming centres that give you some sort of appetite supressant. They work but if you come off them you will baloon! and its ￡50 a month ish but it works|`|8r5A8if1aa	Weight management is a simple. Think about it like a scale - if you're taking in more calories than your body's burning off each day, of course you're going to put on some weight. On the other hand, if you're exercising regularly and eating healthy, you'll find that weight loss comes on its own---- SANS "miracle" diet pills. <br>  <br>  If a pill could help with weight loss, there wouldn't be so many overweight people. I wouldn't recommend spending money on an unproven drug with unpleasant side effects. It sounds to me like you're already doing everything right.

Pg3M8EvNaa	Any health care provider will tell you to go to the doctor if you're coughing up blood, even if it's probably nothing. It is possible to cough so violently that you end up coughing blood, but even still, don't take any chances that you've perforated something. Go to the doctor.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	if you see any blood - go to hospital or patient first immediately!!! <br>  <br>  BIG RISK!!. I am very serious, go to E.R.|`|6QmDm8iwaa	something of the sort happened to me for a week the blood signifies that ur throat is dry and i recommend hot tea and cough drops but personally those didnt work for me i had to wait a solid two weeks for my immune system to strengthen and i took vitamin C tablets|`|4ra84VQDaa	It could be from all the coughing and that you got sick.But it depends on how much you are coughing up as to weather wait or go to the hospital.
inST4SlAaa	Bactrim is the type of antibiotic which does not have any activity against either gonorrhea or chlamydia. Depending on the test that was performed on you-- most tests these days are DNA based tests that are very inexpensive, and very accurate-- the Bactrim would have had absolutely no effect on the detection of either gonorrhea or chlamydia.
mWZE7gF7aa	Kegel exercises...(AKA pelvic floor exercises).  To target the muscles in that area, try to stop the stream of urine while you are on the toilet.  Those are the muscles.  Do this exercise daily, start at 50 a day...You can do them anywhere and no one knows!  <br>  We are told to do them in our birthing class ahead of time (before you have the baby) and build up to 200 times a couple times a day!  =o)|`|CwXe7OgIaa	You need to do your pelvic floor exercises.

I do not know exactly what you can do about it. If you haven't done so already, I would talk to your physician. It has to be your bladder muscles. I doubt it was because you had a child. Then again, I'm not a doctor.<br>  <br>  Talk to a Urologist. I don't know how to fix your problem, a Urologist will.<br>  <br>  What can you do? Wear a diaper so that urine does not leak.

AA12059837	Meditation is wonderful because you can also use that time to put in a positive suggestion with your meditation.  Best time to meditate is first thing in the morning and it will boost your day.<br>  Going to bed an hour earlier would just be a way to sneak into bed earlier - it is good to sleep and dream - we work in the realms in our dreams but we need to clear our mind in this world so meditation is perfect!

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	When you take birth control pills, the hormones do two things, they stop you from ovulating because the body already thinks you are pregnant; and they furnish hormones that stop implantation in case of ovulation.  You are protected because you don't ovulate so can't get pregnant at any time.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|AA11553245	the body is tricked into thinking its actually thinking its getting bc.|`|xQsMPtFGaa	thats ur period week. if you stay on your birth control you wont have a problem.
nTXGaBvLaa	Ya, definitely dont have sex with someone, especially if you are a virgin just to fulfill your "need" to be close to someone.  Try making new friends, talking to a parent, relative, counselor, but dont make up for it by having sex because it will only make you feel worse, trust me.  It will NOT fill the void you are feeling.  I am sure someone cares for you and is willing to be there for you when you need someone!|`|qLuodu3Raa	having sex with someone will not make you feel close to them not really not unless you are in a real relationship if you are not it will make you feel used and hurt and that is it you will be lonelier than before you did it|`|7wWCHn5Taa	try getting a bf but instead of actualy having sex tru masturbating.<br>  its safer and fulfills your needs

MYhQqeV7aa	Your primary care doctor, or the specialist you are seeing should be told about any and all symptoms of illness that you have, even if unrelated to your herpes encephalitis. He or she should also know about all medications, and herbal remedies that you take. Since the canker sores are related to your illness, and you had 15 of them, go see the doctor.

pvYy6iTSaa	Judy - Your urine analysis results are perfectly normal - each and every one.  Congratulations!  BTW normal, fresh-voided urine is slightly acid.  You could mess up your test by drinking beer or a lot of fluids (even water) before urinating as it could dilute the urine, causing a lower specific gravity, which could raise a question about some poorly functioning kidneys unable to concentrate urine and give the needed higher specific gravity.  This might lead to further unnecessary testing.  Play it straight!|`|6fjMtWboaa	It doesn't look too bad, but your urine is acidic which can be indicative of the following.  What did your dr say?<br>  <br>  **A highly acidic urine pH occurs in: <br>  <br>  Acidosis <br>  Uncontrolled diabetes <br>  Diarrhea <br>  Starvation and dehydration <br>  Respiratory diseases in which carbon dioxide retention occurs and acidosis develops<br>  Not enough vegetables|`|AA10928446	color : yellow- normal colour for urine. Certain colours indicate certain things.<br>  Albumin: negative- This is tested to check to see if there is protein in your urine and if so how much.<br>  Reaction: Acidic- Checks for possibility of kidney stones. Yours is acidic which is normal.<br>  Transparency: Clear - Your urine should be clear. Cloudy urine indicates high levels of bacteria.<br>  Sugar: Negative- Healthy urine should not contain sugar. If it is present if could indicate diabetes.<br>  Epithelial cells: nothing is written here- A clean urine catch should contain minimal epithelial cells.<br>  Mucus threads: +- Most urine has mucus threads in it either from vaginal secretions or just because. Its only something to worry over if it is so thick that it appears milky.<br>  renal Cells: 0-2 - You should have very low levels of renal cells in your urine. Most people have none, you dont either.<br>  Pus. cells: 0-3/hpf - This is a white blood cell count. This indicates whether or not there is evidence of infection. You have no infection.<br>  Sp. gravity: 1.015- Tells how concentrated or dilute the urine is.|`|EgRt4LMfaa	proby normal--never seen this kind b4.<br>  my daughter gets ecoli uti's-hers is white cell counts-

It helps to keep a tampon from sliding out, so that's a good thing.  Also your vaginal tissue is normally a little bit folded inside.  That's probably the "piece of skin" you're feeling.<br>  <br>  As previous posters have said, when the tampon is mostly dry, it will be harder to remove.  I'd suggest trying the o.b. brand.  It is shorter and stubbier than Tampax.  Its main drawback is that it doesn't have an applicator, so you must push it inside with your finger.  <br>  <br>  My advice is to also wear a "light days" pad with wings that adheres to your underwear.  It will catch any accidents and give you enough time to get your tampon changed.  You will learn how long you can expect a tampon to last before it's full.  The best time to take it out without risking overflow is when it's about 3/4 saturated.  It should come out pretty easily then.  Pull slowly at first. <br>  <br>  As your flow tapers off on the third, fourth and fifth day, you should use smaller tampons.|`|Qri6T5pqaa	It probably hurts to remove tampons because they and you are dry. Try leaving them in a little longer to soak up more of the menstruation fluid, try removing them while urinating, or moisten your bottom/string with water. I've had the same problem. Hope this helps.|`|vmXZy0kNaa	I tried to get a tampon in and when I didnt get it in I would pull it out and try again, and would put yet another tampon in and when I pull it out oh my god I felt like I was taking ym intestins out...

AUyx1EUSaa	First of all at 13 and a size 3 you sound perfectly healthy.  However, there is nothing wrong with wanting to be toned.  <br>  <br>  I see the most progress combining 30-40 minutes running/ cardio about 4 times/ week with a light weight training circuit for an additional 30 minutes.  You will not build bulk unless you really push it for multiple hours a day.  Take a look at gymnasts - they are ripped but to get that way they need to train 20-30 hours per week. There is no chance you will train that much.  Toned yes, bulk no.  <br>  <br>  What not to do... heavy diet - your far too young and healthy.  You may watch what you eat, but make sure you eat! <br>  <br>  Also - don't worry about numbers!! 10 pounds lost may not get you the visual results you want.  A tighter mid section may not drop too many pounds especially whn you are already thin.  Make sure you know what your goals are other than weight.  <br>  <br>  Above all, be healthy, fun and all for the right reasons.  Don't do this for anyone other than for you.  Good luck!|`|rE5fTHuPaa	i masturbate frequently and do lots of sit ups and push ups. <br>  <br>  b.t.y. :<br>  im 14 and weigh 140 (male)|`|JpDLQBitaa	Well I workout everyday, one day I work with weights, the next day I only work stomach. I'm thinking you'r a female since you where a size 3. And you said you want to loose some off your thighs and stomach. Well you can do is one day just work out your stomach with different combinations of situps (try googleing different situps and you'll be amazed at how many different types of situps there are). And they next day you can work on your thighs, try doing a lot of lunges and squats. Do this workout everyday, but make sure you don't do stomach and thighs on the same day, one each day. Weight yourself on Day 1 and in about 2 or 3 weeks weight yourself again. Good Luck.
buYhmffxaa	I know i cant get to sleep when i have watched to much tv. If your watching too much tv, lay off of it for a while.

Worrying like this can prevent us from relaxing and enjoying a sound night's sleep. There are a number of ways you can relax and distract yourself from the day's worries before sleeping; listen to some gentle, relaxing music, read a book, have a hot, milky drink or a warm bath, and try some deep breathing exercises. Try a few different things out and see what works best for you.<br>  <br>  or try eating a banana half an hour before sleeping.|`|7VmIgqviaa	i recommend you to take a hot bath before bed. try to get a message or acupuncture  .|`|QBSHrxUdaa	do something that calms you

More than likely it is an ovarian cyst or the follicle rupturing to release eggs. Don't let this scare you. Ovarian cysts are very common-usually requiring no medical care, and follicles rupturing are a normal part of life-and you won't feel it all the time. Hope this helps.

Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds. Repeat this three or four times.<br>  <br>  Do this routine every other day and make sure you warm your penis up before each workout by wrapping it in a hot washcloth for five minutes.<br>  <br>  4. A larger penis can be achieved with the use of penis enhancers. There are many forms of penis enhancement products such as pills, patches and topical oils. However, one unique natural product that can produce significant results and makes use of the body's natural abilities comes in the form of a liquid called super-vir <a href="http://www.super-vir.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-vir.com</a><br>  <br>  Always remember, if you are not satisfied with what you were born with, it is never too late to do something about it!|`|tSjJpjzKaa	i dont know about that, but if you want to get a bigger penis you should buy penis enlargement product, one of my friend said it really worked<br>  <br>  maybe someday ill buy it too<br>  <br>  <br>  cheers :)|`|uhjVEzlXaa	No the dont!

7ONKVbbiaa	It never made sense for me to be afraid of tornados, because I was raised in CA.. they don't have them. But I remember seeing a show when I was a little girl, and the fear stayed with me. <br>  So how did I move to TEXAS, for heaven's sake? Now I live where they are. BUT.. my new hubby used to be in HAM radio and RACES (they communicate by radio and storm spot) until he got MS. I got fascinated now, with different weather sites, good radar, and websites that make me aware of what is coming in the next few days (like instability, etc). That is on the computer. We also have scanners for spotter reports. I am on the computer HOURS before anything might come up, so I know if the storm cell is 100 miles off, where it is moving, how intense it is. NOTHING is gonna sneak up on me. Last year I watched radar for my son in law driving a truck and was alert on the Iowa tornado that they were driving behind. I saw it come up on radar. <br>  My point is that I forced me to learn how to be prepared, and now it almost is a game during season. When YOU  are ahead of the knowledge, then you have plenty of time to think about if you will need to take cover, etc. <br>  Email me if you want.. I can help find websites for you. It gives you the power to be as prepared as possible.|`|mA6ZUMPgaa	Move to a diffrent location.|`|uIfOQvqdaa	really i love when tornadoes and storms hit my area....yes, i know that's weird. because whenever they hit, i sit in my basement and eat cookie dough. we sit with the lights off eating all this junk food until the storm passes to keep our mind off of it. haha|`|az0KD0POaa	The only way you can deal with your fears is to expose yourself to it.

5e36acbf7c04a21308ae16d4bdc18239aa	My eyes were dark blue when I was born, they are dark brown now. 90% of babies are born with blue eyes, some change some don't depending on their family genes. <br>  Because ur eyes were so light as a baby, there is a chance they are still changing. The lighting you are in will help determine the colors you see in ur eyes. Maybe in a bright light, (like sun light) you will still see the green crescent. A lot of brown eyed people have green in there eyes. You must have a lot of green in ur eyes and don't even realize it. So depending on ur mood, & ur feelings like anger or sadness the green will tend to show. Other times they may seem really dark. You might have a little birth mark in ur eye that changes it's color from time to time. If you want get it check out by a doctor, but most likely it's a birth mark that changes from brown to green with ur moods. I hope I was able to help you?<br>  <br>  ps.

(insert activity here)..". Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated; there are many options; one is sure to suit you. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies. <br>  <br>  Accept that you, too are just a human being, with the frailties, insecurities, and tendency to err, occasionally, that the rest of us have. That is the beginning of self love, self acceptance, and self esteem. Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary.<br>  <br>  Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Make a list of all your good points, strengths, and achievements. Put it somewhere so you can easily refer to it, from time to time; perhaps on the refrigerator door, or print it; (large typeface, or capitalise) have it framed, and place in your bedroom, or in a position of prominence, such as on the television, or lounge room wall. Practise one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Section 53 at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/self confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself".|`|INn4zm8baa	Just try to create  a more  positive image of yourse lf and think of everything that you can aspire to.

4i2e231Oaa	Does the pain happen more after eating fatty or greasy foods? It could be your gallbladder acting up. I doubt it's your appendix as it is located on the right lower side of your abdomen. Generally gallbladder attacks happen in the right side but from what I understand they can hurt anywhere in the upper abdomen and travel to your back. Hope you feel better! I know doctors can be scary but if this keeps up you should probably see one just in case... Your condition could worsen if it is something serious.|`|Uw5yrnQ6aa	A friend of mine had the same symptoms and he found out his appendix had exploded.. You had better get that checked NOW!!!|`|xOW4V7qiaa	Do you have any other symptoms?  Does it get worse at night, or when you lay down?  Do you take any antacids?  Maybe it's Acid Reflex. Fatigue, and headaches are sometimes a commen things with Diabetics.   Stress also can cause all of those things. Maybe you should try to go to a Chriopracter. Hope you are better soon!
AUyx1EUSaa	I was very overweight in high school but I didn't let anything stop me from joing afterschool sports.  I found that no matter how mean other kids coud be, when you are part of their team and you show nothing but committment you will have respect.  Respect, and a healthier lifestyle (and a legitimate way to get out from under overprotective parental sight!)  Don't be afraid to have your butt kicked by coaches in front of your peers - you will work 20x harder with other people than on your own which will mean much better progress toward whatever personal weight loss goals you may have.  I gained so much respect for myself during my participation in high school athletics.  I achieved so much more than anyone, especially myself, ever expected.  I seriously recommend joing the track team - there are events for everyone!  <br>  <br>  That is my first piece of advice.  But if that is just not in the cards for you there is plenty you can do at your home.  Find something fun to get you moving - Tae Bo is often made fun of but it's very fun and it is effective if you stay consistent - it is also found cheap on ebay!  Or just pick 5 of your favorite exercises, pick a fair number and do them everyday.  Flip flop every other week with 5 other exercises to keep you muscles fired up (this is key - you need to change it up!!)  Simple moves can be found all over the Internet.  If you stay consistent you will slowly make progress. <br>  <br>  The most important thing is to just start!  Whatever you do, stick with it!  True progress is slow and healthy.  Results are only seen over time and you will always need to find motivation in fulfilling your goals in the intermediate future rather than the near future.  Have fun with it and good luck!  <br>  <br>  <br>  Feel free to email me with any questions or if you just need some motivation.  I would be more than happy to help you out!|`|MwDP5oFuaa	u wanna lose weight without wanting to do anything that would make u lose weight...hmm....|`|OHfcGAgIaa	wow there's not much you can do inside unless you can get a treadmill or exercise bike. you need to be getting outside, jogging and the like.|`|AMzuAsDNaa	Run around your house...<br>  Or run on the spot.

yDJiiqcsaa	There's a range of "normal" responses/conditions. Yours sounds high but normal. Try to avoid thinking about it or making it more intense by watching porn.  Try sports and getting rid of excess energy and stress that way. When necessary you'll probably need to masturbate.  Yielding to your desires TOO much can just make things worse (the addictive effect of  "the more you do it - the more you'll need to do it"). It is dangerous physically (disease/pregnancy risk) and socially (getting a slutty reputation).   Do an internet search on "addiction" and see what I mean about the snowballing need in any addictive activity.   Consider if your parents/grandparents have addictive personalities. If "yes" then you may need to take care to "rein yourself in" on any/every potentially addictive behaviors (booze/drugs/sex/gambling) and instead sublimate those tendencies into "good addictions" like exercise/running/sports.   People with addictive personalities are like having an empty closet in your house - if you don't fill it up with organized "good stuff' then it will soon fill up with "crap". Be introspective and figure out WHY you want this so badly. Is it only physical or do you soooo much want the attention of guys that your are "buying it" with your body.   It can be BOTH of those reasons also. <br>  If you treat yourself cheaply - then others will also. Think and take care.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	I think you need to ask this question in Women's Health, Mama!|`|E64juLwJaa	You don't have a problem you just produce a bit to much hormones that's all<br>  Just enjoy it as long as it lasts.<br>  Colors|`|aztQDdMXaa	Don't worry about it, he he I'm the same, and its only natural of your body to feel needs.

I also walk/run for 20-40 minutes a day, 6 days a week. What really helps is eating coconut oil 20 minutes before a meal as it helps boost my metabolism, energy, and keeps me satiated so I eat less. I would recommend reading Eat Fat to Lose Fat or The Maker's Diet. I put my dad and others on this diet and my dad has lost 10 pounds in about a month although he doesn't follow it as strictly as I do.

AA11077726	A fitness plan needs to be tailored to an individual.  Couldn't you receive some help/info from the school's athletic department?  I would highly recommend a good personal trainer to at least start you out.  Or if you have a fellow student or friend who is muscular, you can ask him what he does.  Your bench press weight is a good starting point...about 70% of your weight.
wuTnAeAwaa	There is nothing wrong with yours being a little more protruding. Some women are smaller, some are larger. Like some of us have smaller breasts, some have larger breasts, but we're still considered normal. Don't be shy about asking your doctor. Your doctor is probably the best person to ask if you need reassurance, as I am sure he/she has done many pelvic exams and can tell you that everyone is a little different down there. As long as your area is not uncomfortable, sore, or painful, you shouldn't have anything to worry about.<br>  And as for guys making fun of it, they are idiots. They probably have their own insecurities and inadequacies, so they make themselves feel better by making fun of other people's private parts. Try to ignore the negative answers you are getting. They obviously have nothing better to do than to sit around on Yahoo Answers and try to earn points by anonymously harassing people.|`|M798dyZYaa	Since you've gotten nothing but rude, joking answers...I have the same issue.<br>  <br>  I do not masturbate either.

Drink two beers and call me in the morning.|`|iQaKNSI6aa	nothing thats your personality|`|TaFrxxJXaa	stop conforming.|`|iO08zbtDaa	Quit worrying about what other people think!|`|Gl20z152aa	I used to feel just like you, but I think I'm beginning to grow out of that mindset now.  There is nothing wrong with you and you are not pathetic.  Chances are there are a lot of people who like you, but don't force friendships.  If you're meant to be friends with someone, you will eventually become friends.  Try to talk to people you know have the same interests as you and see what happens.  Just remember: there is nothing wrong with and you are fine the way you are.|`|S8AU5Jbjaa	You are not PATHETIC. You are just being YOU. That's all. & there is nothing wrong at all with that. <br>  <br>  It's good that you like to please people, but just try not overdo it.<br>  We all care what people think, but if you care that much, keep it to yourself & say , "I DON'T CARE."<br>  & if you don't have friends, then make some.|`|MCczXQW3aa	Awww. Honey. It may just be hormones. you have to be your own person and have your own opinions. Listen to what your heart tell s you not wat someone you met on the streets tells you. Be nice, listen as best you can, dont brag, dont change  you attitude from second to next. talk to the out crowd they could be your best friends  they just arent seen that way to other kids. like i was bffs with the in crowd and i realized they dont make you happy .. they just [in my opinion they are OVERATED]  just be yourself<br>  <br>                 Good Luck<br>                     <3|`|3bef6db1e814bbf22fd78ed76d048272aa	You are too nice...<br>  Just don't get with the wrong people, they can mess with you and just use you to get what they want.  You will find real friends when you find your own attitude and views.  I was like that for along time, but you have to just put your opinion out there and say what you wanna say, not say what you think they want to hear.|`|g5m3V7iqaa	Nothings wrong with you, you just need to learn that you shouldn't have to please others, and that you are just fine the way you are and that if other people don't like you, then oh well.|`|hoxaIVcpaa	I am the same... that's just who you are so try to accept it, because nothing is going to change|`|p76OZimvaa	maybe ur all those things but ur just shy.<br>  just be yourself<br>  open up to people<br>  and hold ur head up high<br>  you dont need tons of friends to have fun<br>  only good ones! :)|`|4gyOqTqGaa	are you asking this to us ?<br>  <br>  you should be asking this to yourself..|`|sN9l37EHaa	be yourself...|`|8oovDGZgaa	you havent found me yet =)|`|xcaRQ4Lpaa	your too much of a push over sorry but you need to stand up for yourself!|`|btgxidCUaa	because you think of yourself in a negative way|`|h0a4bpW8aa	ur just nice|`|0tZqkiDdaa	I AM THE SAME WAY .

1vaqtRI2aa	Vaginal odors are normal and you douching will only make it worse.<br>  <br>  If you wash with a mild soap outside the vulva (not inside the vagina) every day or every other day, it will cut down on the smell. But like I said, smell is normal, and the more you try and fix it, the worse it'll get.<br>  <br>  You can try Summers eve if it really bothers you, BUT NO DOUCHING. Your vulva does not like that!<br>  <br>  It's also possible you may have a yeast infection. If the odor is fishy like and you have cottage cheese like discharge, go to a doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	you could have an infection|`|uPAl4Jb7aa	Yes it gets embarrassing at times. It often comes from yeast infection and bacterial infection. Bacterial infection is the most prevalent. It may have to do with sex, but that does not mean you can not have it even if you do not have sex (I know you are a virgin, you mentioned it).<br>  <br>  My friend's wife had once used the following and had found it really good:<br>  <a href="http://rampurhaat.bvcures.hop.clickbank.net/" rel="nofollow">http://rampurhaat.bvcures.hop.clickbank....</a><br>  <br>  You might think of trying it out. It costs a mile lesser than medical advise, but still works.|`|t4IHsRXBaa	what u can do is have cranberry juice. what it does is flushes out ur system so when u pee it will be clear.|`|g5m3V7iqaa	You shoud just keep washing it regularly, vaginal odors are normal for everyone.|`|4oo2Idlyaa	It could just be puberty, or else you need to change your eating habits. What you eat can affect the smell and taste down there...

arsAqGf7aa	I doubt it if you are both under 18, though you can have a parent, sister, or girlfriend.  After you're over 18 you will probably be able to have a boyfriend in there if the doctor doesn't mind.  I've never had any desire to have my boyfriend in there with me.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	NO, NO, they will not let him in with you!  The only people allowed in the exam room is blood related.  You are still a minor in the eyes of the law. He can wait in the waiting room for you.  If you don't tell your mom about the previous BF, the doctor will tell her if he suspects something and your present BF will get the blame for it.  TELL YOUR MOM!!|`|AA10358331	I don't think so. Because you are still a minor they will only allow blood relatives like your mom or sister. <br>  I know its scary, but I promise you it really isn't. Try to focus on something on the wall.. and ask the doctor to talk to you to try to keep your mind off of everything..<br>  Good Luck!!|`|xQsMPtFGaa	if you were sexually/physically abused by a previous boyfriend you NEED to tell your mother. and the cops. would you want that guy to do that to another girl??<br>  <br>  but yes he should be able to be there with you. i dont see the big deal with it.|`|qLuodu3Raa	might depend on the doctor but really if they do not let him in do not worry about it it is no big deal they do not do anything that hurts you|`|19ffba4361dcf9c1511f4e3daa996315aa	yes he can go|`|g5m3V7iqaa	probably not
KWL7Y3Rzaa	I know what you're saying. I feel that way too sometimes, especially after exercising. It's important to listen to your body and eat only when it tells you to, but sometimes we do have to intervene. Do you exercise a lot? That could affect your hunger. That means you just gotta eat even if you aren't hungry.<br>  <br>  Also, the less you eat and the more you starve your body, the less hungry you will be. Your body adapts very easily; it's very strong. But I'll have you know, this also slows down your metabolism a lot, which means in the future it will be hard to eat anything without gaining weight. This is why it's important to get adequate food intake.<br>  <br>  I recently overcame my battle with anorexia but still struggle. Not to suggest you are, but your problems very much relate to mine. Depriving your body of food is destroying your perfectly made being. Please don't think your otherwise.|`|f6570cfbea3dd78b529876a088bffb0eaa	You sound like you are suffering from anorexia.  You don't say how much you weigh.  You don't mention your age or height.  It's hard for us to know what to think.|`|AA10323599	this is not normal. please see a doctor. is this a recent condition or have you been like this for a while? you would be malnourished if you continue like this.
wXKs94nDaa	I go to the meetings but I know people who used weight watchers online and got amazing result. But if it is difficult for you to stay focused then I'd say that the meetings are a better option.|`|jQCy5x9Iaa	Hey dear,<br>  there's an article i read and it helped me very much, also i think it's better than weight watchers, and it was talking about meal plans and how to use the calorie shifting technique to achieve your ideal weight, this web based program it's all about how to get you to lose 9 lbs. every 11 days in a healthy manner, So you will lose this extra weight in no time.<br>  anyway you can see for yourself here is the link to this article <br>  <a href="http://overweightdoc.wordpress.com/2009/03/04/fat-loss-for-idiots-online-diet-system-secret-tips/" rel="nofollow">http://overweightdoc.wordpress.com/2009/...</a> hope it helps|`|6LD0CpIdaa	Weight Watchers is great. They helped me to identify and break some very bad eating habits that had built up over time. I was able to lose over 20 pounds in only a few months. Plus, I got to eat my own food (I love spicy food and not many diets allowed me to get the heat that I need).  I did it online and found it was fine.  I guess it depends on you.<br>  <br>  If you want to try Weight Watchers they are running Weight Watchers 25% off coupon offers in the USA and Canada.<br>  <br>  You can get them here:<br>  <br>  Weight Watchers USA coupon: <a href="http://www.canbuy.ca/weightwatchersUSA.a..." rel="nofollow">http://www.canbuy.ca/weightwatchersUSA.a...</a><br>  <br>  Weight Watchers Canada coupon:<br>  <a href="http://www.canbuy.ca/weightwatchers.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.canbuy.ca/weightwatchers.asp</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Its a nice tool.  However, the actual meetings generally help even more.  You're able to see other people, face to face, and be motivated by them and held accountable by them.  Also, you have the opportunity to meet some wonderful people.  Its easier to find a work-out buddy when you meet up at least once a week anyway.|`|AA11028659	as long as you want  to loose weight,any support you gan get will be a great help for you,
jvJqmliBaa	I think you should go to the doctor.|`|AA10358331	I think you should see a doctor as well, to get on birth control! If your periods are that long and that heavy, and your discharge is that heavy as well.. get on birth control. <br>  It just sounds like your hormones are out of whack and birth control can fix that. It will shorten and lighten your periods and hopefully lighten the discharge. <br>  <br>  I hope that everything goes well.
HcoYZdy1aa	You need some antibiotics so it can either treat the infection inside your toe or prevent it from happening.<br>  I would go to like a minor emergency center around where you live.<br>  You can go to the ER but it can be a longer wait and a bigger medical bill if you don't have health insurance<br>  From what you wrote, I recommend you see a doctor for your toe
71I16AGQaa	stop smoking! that will cause less saliva|`|52otNiElaa	Haha, well Mr. Montana, try holding the cigar in your mouth with your teeth instead of your lips.|`|NxGqxsBvaa	Stop smoking cigars and start eating jelly beans.|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	Drink water before you smoke, and if you have too much saliva just spit it out.|`|EbmieiNHaa	tolerance. your body will get used to it eventually
aTBs7pJ4aa	your workout is incorrect.. and will return little results... u are working out the same muscles everyday... u cannot do that.. u only need to train each muscle once or twice per week..<br>  <br>  a good example of a workout would be<br>  <br>  mon chest<br>  tue biceps triceps<br>  wed shouders<br>  thur back<br>  fri legs<br>  <br>  take 3 - 4 different exercises for each muscle.. at 8 - 10 reps each<br>  about 4 sets per exercise.<br>  <br>  <br>  u should join a gym..|`|CABw51hkaa	im 14 and  people say i use steroids....i do lift ups
MzCL0dzjaa	First. You should take the protein shake 1 hour prior to whenever you start working out, this will help your muscles have more energy...ect.  <br>  <br>  And you take it after your done with your whole workout, your body is still in it's anabolic stage when doing cardio, so once you're done with cardio take it right after your workout, no later than 30 minutes.
LY1k1xvLaa	First off, if she is only eating one meal a day she would be loosing weight in the first place, throwing it up or not. So getting rid of the little food she does eat, would cause her to loose weight. After a while she will start gaining the weight back, either because she will start over-eating or her body will start keeping the fat in her food's because her body will go into starvation mode.<br>  <br>  Trust me, I know a lot about this. I've been going through the same thing for about a year now. So talk to her about it, maybe she will feel comforted. Because for along time, I denied it until I finally talked to my bestfriend about it and she was very understanding.|`|uf9pZFlzaa	From what you're saying, she definitely is showing signs of bulimia. This is a very dangerous disease, so you need to get her help as fast as possible before she causes serious damage to her body. Is there a counselor or someone you can talk to? Or your parents? Please help your friend.
Dvawm8Ezaa	You probably are anorexic.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	YES to the Extreme.|`|K3YKF9fBaa	Umm I think you are. It's pretty obvious if you wrote this down by yourself.|`|cfn8mYF6aa	Sounds lke it to me. Try to be happy with yourself. Im really skinny too. People tell me that atleast. I really dont think i am. Just eat healthy and try hard not to stress about it..|`|7ciDto6Daa	I think you may be anorexic. & need to consider seeing a counselor.<br>  Good luck !|`|uiGx0rPVaa	have the same prob :(|`|LY1k1xvLaa	I have the same problem. I went through the exact same thing last summer and I lost 30 pounds. At first I denied it but finally came to realize that I am anorexic. But if you are constantly tired and dizzy every time you stand up, it could be because your not eating enough. After a while, you'll start gaining weight. Lastly, you may think that bones popping out are pretty but if you think other's do, your wrong. People will eventually start talking about it and asking you about it.<br>  <br>  Talk to someone, even your bestfriend or mom, it really helps.|`|6FOKld0uaa	well its a very emotion thing<br>  and its in your mind too! i cant remember the word tho O_o<br>  haha<br>  im a teen girl too and ive had experience with this stuff.<br>  Do you think you're anorexic?<br>  I think you're at a great weight :)<br>  dont worry about anything! you need to have fun and be happy and enjoy life.  Instead of putting yourself down, focus on what you like about yourself! hang out with friends and do things you like!<br>  Maybe do something that will boost your confidence :)<br>  Like something with your hair!<br>  Try doing things that will make you better and not worse!<br>  eat lots of vegetables and fruits and stop weighing yourself<br>  cut out sugars and salty foods and fatty foods<br>  excersize too!<br>  just try and be more confident and try to think of other things besides food...<br>  good luck :)|`|Q7ALl9zeaa	Sure sounds like you might be anorexic. If you are seeing it, then do something about it. You say you hate how you are feeling, then you have to change it. Anorexia is a disease and it has to treated in a certain way. I have added some sites for you to check out. promise yourself and everyone who loves you that you will take the step to see a dr. <a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/common/mentalhealth/eating/063.html" rel="nofollow">http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.anred.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anred.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.anad.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anad.org/</a>|`|v9zA4YKxaa	without a doubt I could tell you yes before I even finished reading your column.  Get help.

I think you should go to your local GP/doctor and get help. Also find a counsellor you should go and see.
EN32vSsCaa	Ceftin (cefuroxime) is an antibiotic.  You can't get high off an antibiotic.  But you can die by taking them if you are allergic.
ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	Getting it wet is not ideal, but OK as long as the cut didn't break open.  Wearing  a wet band aid is also not a good idea - band aids should be changed if they get wet.   If the finger got infected from being wet, the cut should have gotten more painful by now and the finger would be inflamed.|`|DKYNxb7aaa	no, all they do is put a form of super glue on but it is weaker than super glue and is made to hold skin together.  you will be fine as long as you keep an eye on it.
6w7FKrlfaa	even if u are gay.. so what..?  being gay is okay...  it's not a mental illness...  porn is overrated...  when i was in school.. and unsure of my sexuality.. a person once told me to picture a man and woman naked.. which one turns u on more?<br>  guy.. you're gay<br>  girl.. you're str8<br>  both ... you're bi<br>  they're just labels anyways.. just be urself|`|xO1LQWbZaa	It doesnt.  Maybe you arnt into porn, sweetie.  You can only be gay if you find males attractive.  You'll find someone, and you'll find out that way.  Good luck!|`|JTVzERXhaa	OF COURSE NOT!<br>  This could just mean you're more mature ot possibly even less mature...<br>  It all depends on your age/if you have interest in girls.<br>  <br>  Straight girls can watch guys... doing stuff... but some can be completely unaffected.
bJ8egiGCaa	i suffer from insomnia also.<br>  i find no food from after dinner helps, no drink, no tv, no computer. it helps you prepare and keeps your mind... inactive.<br>  I find a hot bath by candlelight helps, and then sleep and hot bath if i wake up.<br>  Hope I help.<br>  Ichiban.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Ever since I can remember I've had issues sleeping. <br>  <br>  I don't know if this is the best but maybe an exercises machine in your house would be a good way to make yourself tired. Jogging at night can be dangerous.|`|LmUZxVBRaa	I used to have troubles with insomnia too. What I did was go all natural. No msg no aspartame both are excitotoxins. I wouldn't smoke much if any. That helped some. Then I gave up tap water. I drink and cook with only purified non fluoridated water. I then started taking bentonite clay baths and internally one teaspoon in 16 oz water once a day on empty stomach. Baking soda also same amount dose.<br>  Half cup clay one teaspoon in the baths three times a week for half an hour.<br>  I sleep harder now like I did when I was younger. I lost weight and for the anxiety attacks I started taking a vitamin called hair nails and skin.<br>  It has all the b vitamins and paba which really helps with anxiety attacks.<br>  There is a program I got also called holosync. Its a meditative cd that really helps your brain to go into the theta delta and alpha states. You feel more relaxed and calm.<br>  I am no longer tired. I don't snore anymore. I cant figure that one out.<br>  But anyways hope this helps you. It really helped me and my family as I am no longer grumpy and feel more at ease.<br>  I also use acupressure points for the times I get really stressed out.
3KWodOgIaa	Relax, there nothing to it, nothing will happen. Just use a tweezers to pull it, that way u'll be more in focus n the tip of the tweezer can directly pin point on the tick n pull it. After that simply clean it with any antiseptic, n chill. These are normal everyday matters n issues when u deal with dogs, keep ur cool n patience, its nothing serious, u wont get infected with any diseases. If the dog growls use a muzzle, or something sweet like a cookie to distract it, if nothing is available at the moment, make sure the tick is dead, as next day again u'll have to find it, n spray/apply antiseptic on the spot, next day just simply remove it with a tweezer and again clean the spot.|`|45a8c885a9b24a213fe52c9cba5e4a24aa	you could check with the 24 hour nurse hotline.

pMjFLRCRaa	dbraunofva  -  Not only is it innappropriate to refer to someone who is confused due to a stroke an 'idiot' but you're also medically wrong.  <br>  <br>  To the asker, Your father has indeed missed out on the critical time during which one would need medical response.  That being said we have no idea of the type and severity of the stroke, nor the health and age of your father.  Your father is most likely, at least somewhat,  confused so you may have to convince/argue with him.  If you call EMS before convincing him, however,  it would be a difficult for anyone responding.  He's verbal enough to refuse assistance and things would become very tricky; he would either be left alone, or restrained and taken to a hospital (in states where this is allowed in specific situations).  Unless you're willing to 'let go', you'll have to convince him to go to the hospital.  If in doubt, call an ambulance; they'll be able to have a better understanding of the situation and at least explain this to you better.<br>  <br>  Your father may have good reason to be refusing medical attention.  If he feels he's lived a full life, he may just be ready to go.  Again, when dealing with him, expect confusion, irritability, and severe depression coming in mood swings; remember, that's due to the loss of brain function.  Even if he is ready to go, and is willing to die of this stroke, you'll need medical attention at some point.|`|JTJ3Xza3aa	You should have called 911 when it was obvious your father was having a stroke.  Confusion or inability to make appropriate decisions is to be expected when someone’s brain is experiencing impaired circulation and oxygen deprivation.  If he dies or has permanent impairment, it will be your fault because you didn’t do the right thing when he wasn’t able to make decisions on his own.|`|bHRCT786aa	Yes.|`|NxGqxsBvaa	Yes.  Start making plans for his funeral and also to pay for it.|`|2eztcCO0aa	No.  But your dad's an idiot.  There were medications he could take to reverse the effects of a stroke, but he needed to take them within a few hours of the onset of symptoms.  Now the damage can't be undone.<br>  <br>  For Bob:  My answer was based on personal experience.  I have an aunt who doesn't believe in doctors and has lived with problems that could have been easily solved if she'd just sought medical help.  She even ignored a lump in her breast until it evolved into Stage 3 cancer.  More recently, she had a stroke, but just figured that nothing could be done about it, so she didn't bother to go to the doctor,  Later she found out that she could have been helped if only she'd known to do something about it.  She's educated and intelligent enough to have known better, but she was blinded by her lifelong mistrust of medicine.  She's now suffering the consequences of her screwed up attitude.  So yes, I think she's an idiot.<br>  <br>  But I didn't consider that the father's stroke may have caused him to be confused, which led him to refuse medical attention.  My bad.

AA11693263	I am on day 8 of it. I do feel better except I have the cough and my eyes are killing me still. But the part that is not going away at all is the sheer exhaustion. I am sleeping more than I am awake. I woke up at 11:30 today and by 3 I layed down to take a nap and didn't wake up until 7:30. I fell asleep for a few hours late this evening and am only awake now because my husband is up up because he works nights and has gotten all of the sleep he is going to get tonight. He is on his computer and I am on mine but we are talking. I am sure I will be asleep again within the hour and sleep quite late in the morning considering we just lost an hour with the time change and we wen t from 2am to 3pm and lost that hour.|`|qfZQCSRRaa	same thing here. its gotten worse over almost 2 weeks though.

I'm getting depressed from being sick.  The guy that just remodeled our basement said it was a ten day thing for him.  Do nyquil every night and aleve cold and sinus during the day.  It works twelve hours and is pretty amazing.  It sucks, but it will go away.
J0xddqmXaa	You asked a great question and the answer is YES. It is not about erasing bad memories as some are answering ..you asked about suppressing bad memories and science is showing that you 100% can. There is a techniques that is taught by Collin Camino in the "Why you do not want to live"online  report to stop depression, suicidal, and self harm cutting..it is based on scientific proof. <br>  <br>  A doctor cannot help at all...therapy can help you come to understand it but will not suppress it. I think this is the report online here <a href="http://suiciderateup.wordpress.com/about/" rel="nofollow">http://suiciderateup.wordpress.com/about...</a>|`|Hxfnwz3Baa	To my knowledge there isn't a way to voluntarily erase bad memories. Part of growing up is learning to cope with some memories you might not like to face. Your mind can suppress memories on it's own if it knows they are too traumatic for you to face at that moment but they may come back later (temporary amnesia). I'd say if your brain hasn't automatically suppressed them, you should probably work on learning to cope with them instead of suppressing them since feelings have a way of manifesting in many many ways (not always good ways either).|`|xqJI47g0aa	I also recommend EMDR.  It will not erase the memories per say, but it will allow your brain to process and then store away the memories so that they are not front and center in your mind all the time.  <br>  <br>  The problem is that when something traumatic happens, your brain is unable to process it and put it back on the back shelf, because it is too strong for your brain alone. The EMDR acts as an assistant for your brain to process the memory, take it off the display rack and stuff it in the back shelf so you don't have to look at it all the time.|`|AVk6x3Beaa	First learn that the past is history, tomorrow is a mystery, all you have is today. Next, look at the memory as something presented as a chance to learn. Face it, learn all you can from it and then move on. You won't forget, and probably shouldn't but at least once examined you take the power away from that memory. If you have difficulty applying this, seek the help of a counselor. If your brain just doesn't want to let it go then there is something you are unable to comprehend about it.|`|NpZe8aXyaa	After yrs of severe haunting memories and foggy ones I finally got help.

inST4SlAaa	Anal itching can be caused by irritating chemicals in the foods we eat, such as are found in spices, hot sauces, and peppers. <br>  <br>  <br>  Anal itching also can be caused by the irritation of continuous moisture in the anus caused by frequent liquid stools, diarrhea, or escape of small amounts of stool (incontinence). Moisture increases the possibility of infections of the anus, especially yeast, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus or HIV. <br>  <br>  <br>  Treatment with antibiotics also can lead to a yeast infection and irritation of the anus. <br>  <br>  <br>  Psoriasis also can irritate the anus. <br>  <br>  <br>  Abnormal passageways (fistulas) from the small intestine or colon to the skin surrounding the anus can form as a result of disease (such as Crohn's disease), and these fistulas bring irritating fluids to the anal area. <br>  Other problems that can cause anal itching include:<br>  <br>  pinworms, <br>  <br>  <br>  hemorrhoids,<br>  <br>  <br>  tears of the anal skin (fissures), and <br>  <br>  <br>  skin tags (abnormal local growth of anal skin).

eFW5O92Yaa	Well judging by your stats I'd say it shouldn't be too hard. The #1 thing about gaining muscle though is that you have to eat more calories than you burn. If you don't then there's no way to gain anything. Make sense? <br>  <br>  As for the routine most people do 3 days sections covering several muscle groups on each day, then repeat it another 3 days then a one day break, which covers the week so it's a constant schedule. You might want to go light and hit high reps and more sets sometimes to shock the system and burn a little fat to make it more noticeable, lean muscle. I jog for about an hour every other day too. Here's my routine(10 reps for every set):<br>  <br>  Day 1:<br>  Biceps, 4 excercises of 3 sets each<br>  Triceps, 3 excercises of 4 sets each<br>  Forearm, 3 excercises of 4 sets each<br>  Shoulders, 4 excercises of 3 sets each<br>  <br>  Day 2:<br>  Traps, 3 excercises of 4 sets each<br>  Chest, 4 excercises of 3 sets each<br>  Back/lats, 3 excercises of 4 sets each<br>  Abs, 4 excercises of 3 sets each<br>  Obliques, 3 excercises of 4 sets each<br>  <br>  Day 3: (I'll give you the actual excercises because I'm limited on these excercises and just do certain ones)<br>  Squats, 4 sets<br>  Leg extentions, 4 sets<br>  Leg flexions, 4 sets<br>  Calf raises, 4 sets|`|W2YtVUqKaa	lose the fat and the muscle will start showing.  assuming that 205 pounds are not all fat you should have some pretty decent muscle down there so lose about 15 pounds and you ll look pretty ripped|`|F0ImwHlUaa	Consume protein the same as your body weight. 205 lb=205g.

If you try to lose faster, your body will go into "starvation mode" and get very stingy about burning calories while at the same time very efficient about storing any calories that you do provide. And it will make you feel awful. <br>  <br>  There is no site specific way of losing fat... the old myth about working your abs to burn belly fat isn't true. To get rid of love handles, you need to lose overall fat. That happens with exercise and watching your diet. More on that below. <br>  <br>  The most effective way to lose fat is aerobic exercise in the "moderate" fat-burning range, ideally first thing in the morning before you eat. When you wake your body is ready to burn fat and your levels of growth hormone are highest at that time. Later in the day it can take up to 30 minutes just to put your body into a fat-burning mode. <br>  <br>  Another overlooked way to burn fat is by lifting weights. Skeletal muscle has very high caloric needs... almost twice that of adipose (fat) tissue. Put on a little muscle and you will burn calories all day even at rest. Be aware that skeletal muscle weighs more, so with this approach you may see your weight increasing while your body fat is melting away. Not realizing this often stresses folks who think they should be losing weight as a measure of fitness. Forget the scale, look in the mirror and you will be happy.<br>  <br>  To lose a pound of fat, you need to eliminate about 3500 calories. You can do this by burning more with exercise or by modifying your diet to reduce intake. If you do a Google search on say, "swimming calories" you will quickly find a website with tables of calories burned for a given exercise. You can use such lists to estimate how many calories you are burning up with your routine.<br>  <br>  For diet, keep a diary for a couple of weeks counting calories, grams of protein, and grams of fat intake. It is easy with online sources of nutritional information (type the name of the food and calories into the Google search engine) and packaging labels. That will let you quickly figure out where the fat is coming from in your diet. <br>  <br>  Fat gives you 9 calories per gram. So take the number of grams of fat, multiply by 9, then calculate what percentage the fat calories are of your total daily calories. Restricting the calories from fat to about 20% of your total intake is ideal for a maintenance diet... that isn't overly restrictive. Of note, you need some fat in your diet. For instance, the body uses fat to produce hormones. Once you have a picture of how to modify your diet, you can drop the diary and just go back to it occasionally if you are wanting to tweek things further.<br>  <br>  There is a subset of questions that goes further and asks about "How to get a six-pack?" The answer is the same. Six-packs are 20% abdominal exercise and 80% diet. There is one caveat... abdominal muscles will form in the position that you work them, so be certain to pull them tightly toward your spine while doing crunches, etc. Also, during most lifting, the "core is active" which means that you should be stabilizing with contracted abs then too. Fail to do this and the abs will form, but bulging outward and the result is not attractive.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to build muscle as a way to lose fat, then you may need to increase total calories and specifically your protein intake. I target about 0.8 g of protein per pound of body weight each day when actively building. That is far more protein than most people need in their diets.

e747c2c4f42307a0319a41df54a314d0aa	yes.u should see a dr,a counselor or a grief therapist.u can find free grief therapists through hospice and also thru the catholic church.u dont have to be catholic,(IM NOT)and they dont try to convert u.i went to one for a year aftera family member died,we didnt disuss rekligion,just ways to deal with ur grief.a school counselor may be able to steer u in the right direction,or call ur county mental health organisation(ur local hospital will have a number)and u can see someone for free or on a scale based on income.if u have health insurance,it may pay for u to see a psychologist.every1 needs help sometimes,dont be embarassed to ask for it.u feel like lashing out because ur hurting,and ur mad that this happened to u-completely understandable.get some help in managing and dealing with these overwhelming feelings,u will be glad u did.sorry for ur loss.best wishes.u will always remember her,and eventually life will get better,and u will be happy again..my fiance was shot 7 years ago.i honor him every day.but i have a wonderful life with my husband now,and am very happy.this will happen for u someday,too.it isnt disrespect to ur mom to eventually live and laugh again after the worst of ur grief has been healed.its an honor to her love,that u live a full life.but for now,ur in pain.therapy is the way thru the pain..blessings.|`|9X80v9Wsaa	No they'll just give you all kinds of disorders and **** so they can give you tons of medications..<br>  <br>  Everyone thinks of killing people when they're angry and such, now if you start like buying pistols and ammo maybe you should, but really if you just think the world would be better without them you are 100% correct anyone who tells you different is a stupid ***...|`|qdaJG8Noaa	Okay thinking of killing people is normal, but when you said because you feel like your mom was taken away from you you have the right to take someone elses life, that where it gets tricky, and inturn yes you should talk to therapist about that.  But if it was merely thinking about taking the lives of those whom harm people, thats more vigilanty.  Also it depends on if you would actually act on your thoughts.  I mean everyone has thought about killing someone atleast once in there life.  But what you said is understandable, I got it.  It hurts, I'm sorry, and I think no matter who you are or whats going on in your life its always good to have someone to bounce ideas off of and talk about how you feel.  My recommendation is to go see a therapist, talk, and just keep your head up!|`|XD3QN8D9aa	I think is to see to therapy  and don't tell them you want to kill someone say that you feel like taking pain to others that have caused pain to you so if you say kill the might send you to a metal problem home and might put you in a strip jacket were you  can't move you arms or hands and it is very uncomfortable so  when you go to therapy  the guidance therapist will tell you to go to your happy place where no one can harm you so you can picture you and your mom are together and that place were safe and no one harms you you are just free together free probably don't see a doctor p.s. you kinda look like my avatar|`|45qyvYU2aa	The short answer here, is yes.|`|AA12111193	yes!!
uzMLuL9Daa	omg ur just like me! i always skip the weekends. but then i feel bad all week!|`|sYO70GJRaa	You should be fine, providing you exercise. On these days, it's probably a good idea to eat breads and meats. Five days of salad is not particularly good for you but if you eat a balance on the weekends this would probably compensate. Make sure you still drink plenty of milk. It is really good for you. If you don't like it, flavour it or something or eat yoghurt and other dairy products. This is very important. <br>  <br>  It also depends on what your idea of "normal" is!|`|H2uAJoeMaa	lol @ salad.<br>  <br>  I would especially recommend cheat days (only one a week though) for someone who was lifting weights but restricting carbs during the week - the insulin response from a sudden intake of sugar helps build muscle.|`|UWO7SVVeaa	try to limit the weekends to 1200|`|Zaj3m6huaa	yea if u wanna|`|2ImIgJwXaa	You wont lose weight if you binge every weekend. Plus, your metabolism would get all screwed up and your body wouldnt properly digest. Maybe a small cheat-like a piece of chocolate or small piece of cake. Also, I hope your getting more than salads in the week. You need all food groups-even a little fat/oil|`|aRimSMZ9aa	well first of all you need to eat more than salads during the week. People think if they starve themselves then you will loose weight. EAt lean chicken and fish, vegetables, and lots of whole grains. And as for cheating on the weekends..maybe just dessert?|`|o5piRiBsaa	First off, you should be eating more than just salad.  You should have a healthy balance of protein, whole grain carbs, and fats!  And don't go under 1200 calories a day, period.  Secondly, I am all for cheat days (just one day a week, though), if you are strict about following your diet during the week and keeping up with your exercise.  Eat what you want that day, don't count calories (unless you want to), and stop eating once you're satisfied -- don't eat to the point of sickness.  It raises your metabolism back to baseline and when you go back to your diet the next day, it will still be burning high.

MJMsOFpiaa	If you want to be more outgoing, you have to challenge yourself. Start out small, just compliment someone's sweater. The worst that could happen from a compliment is like nothing. Try smiling at people when you make eye contact. You've got to start out small, and then when you get the hang of it it will be easy. Always keep yourself in check by making sure that when you do talk that your voice is loud and not shaky. Remember that most people are shy and just like you, they want to talk, but they just can't bring themselves to it. <br>  Try starting conversations by first talking about yourself, and then asking questions. Like "oh wow, this is expensive for nail polish altho i do like the color," Just make small talk. You don't have to be outgoing, but if you get scared when you have to talk, in can get in the way of what you want to do with your life.

GGmaSpHDaa	Lifting weights will not hinder your growth. This is just an unfortunate myth that keeps being repeated. <br>  <br>  Doctors recommend strength training for youth.  It improves athletic performance and helps prevent injury. <br>  <br>  Various medical websites have articles on this.  For example, see the following statement linked from the Cleveland Clinic: <br>  <br>  “Despite the previously held belief that strength training was unsafe and ineffective for children, health organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) now "support children's participation in appropriately designed and competently supervised strength training programs."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/strengthtrainingforyoung.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/stre...</a><br>  <br>  NSCA position on resistance training for youth.<br>  <a href="https://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/Y...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/downlo...</a><br>  <br>  While you won’t stunt your growth lifting weights, you can be injured.

nAp688tZaa	The only reason you felt it was stronger was because of the amount of Oxycodone in each of the pills.  Percocet are only 5/325 or 10/325 and Oxycontin only starts at 10 mg's per pill and then goes up from there.  They are exactly the same medication, but OC is the extended release formulation and Percocet is the Immediate release formulation with tylenol added.  You more than likely got sick because of the strength of the medication.  If you are not opiate tolerant, or in severe pain, I am not sure why you would have received a prescription for oxycontin.  Most people who have never used narcotics, or have only used them on a limited basis, do just fine with Percocet, even after major surgery.  As far as getting high, my guess was that you took this medication without a prescription for it and the dose of the pill was too high.  No doctor would prescribe a strong dose of OC if the person was not already taking them and needed to have the dosage stepped up to control the pain better.  If you do not have a prescription for these medications, you need to stay away from the pills.  It is a good way to get addicted and ruin your life in no time flat.|`|45qyvYU2aa	There are different milligrams of the active ingredient in both, you need to check the dosages.|`|FjIND80Gaa	OxyContin is nothing more than a concentrated form of Oxycodone, for example if you took a 40mg OC, you might as well have taken 8 5mg Percocets. And since I capitalized the O and C in OxyContin and it might appear as though I am shouting, I better get off of here.

pvYy6iTSaa	Pumx - The meaning of your wording is a little unclear.  Since a colonoscopy only examines the colon (which is the large intestine only), the colonoscopy does NOT see what's in the small intestine.  I  suspect the surgeon meant that the bowel or intestinal preparation was not adequately cleansing and did not remove all the feces (stool) from the large intestine, something necessary to allow adequate "seeing" of the inner surfaces of the large intestine ("colon").  Your Dulcolax and Matrix simple did not do an adequate cleansing job.  Though quite uncortable, you might need a repeat though perhaps not right away and with a more effective cleansing prep.  Sorry about that, but NOT something to worry about.

Everyone is different, but women aren't considered to be finished developing physically until their early 20's. So be patient. ;)|`|Bdo2GNA2aa	well its not like in one day their going to suddenly pop out and be a D<br>  it'll take a few years for them to be full size.|`|AA12198724	In due time but i dont think you will notice it. dont rush it and let puberty take its course. Besides your breast may not get as big as your mothers.
VCIZJQCJaa	sounds like a perfect migraine if there is such a thing.the way to break it is to break the cycle with sleep.put yourself in a dark quiet room.bring a wet washcloth with you to put on your head neck and temples.also rest on 2 pillows.the more your heart beats the more throbbing you will feel so try to rest.sip on some fluids so you don't dehydrate and don't take medicine too close together. sometimes if you can throw up it will help immediately.if it doesn't get better go to the emergency room they will give you medicine that will knock you out and break the cycle.i suffer from migraines too|`|CwNMq7RTaa	Just for future reference, I've learned it's better to head it off at the pass.  Don't wait till the pain gets worse to start medicating.  I learned this the hard way after years of horrible headaches.  As soon as you get the first twinge take something.  I know that doesn't help now.  I don't know what to say.  Excedrine helps me when I have a bad one.  Maybe take some more tylenol and have coffee with it.  And if you have aspirin or advil, take that too.  That's what excedrine is- tylenol, aspirin and caffeine.
G6qddcT1aa	It is 30 seconds of maxiumum effort, followed by 30 seconds of "rest" in an overhead hold position. Score is how many reps you get per round, or total reps completed. Typically you do 4 minutes, which is 4 sets.<br>  <br>  The sequence looks like this:<br>  30 seconds of as many push presses as possible<br>  30 seconds of overhead hold<br>  30 seconds of as many push presses as possible...<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  Rest may only be taken during the push press sequence, not during the rest period. Go figure.

u8CFwtyMaa	You won't be able to just stop, try to cut down.<br>  If you're doing it 6 times a day, try to find something else to do when you get the urge, and try to get down to, say, twice a day.<br>  If you can manage twice a day for a week, reward yourself with a good session at the end of the week.<br>  Next try to get down to once a day, and when you can manage that, again reward yourself with a good session.<br>  Next try to miss a day occasionally, and by this time, you'll be doing it at about the right rate.<br>  Try to enjoy it more, and prolong it, if you're doing it 6 times a day, you're probably rushing it, and not fully enjoying it. You'll find that one good one is more satisfying than 6 quickies anyway.<br>  Hope this helps
A9WCbC8aaa	The best yoga based workout to lose weight is the YRG Workout.  They have a great results section that show tremendous weight loss.  I tried it and they added in other exercise movements to get your heart rate up and in your fat burning zone.  It also stengthens your core and works your abs but it does not focus on the abs so it my not help the person who specifically wants to work that area.  It is a total body workout.  Good Luck!
uPwyLImUaa	I'm do this same thing. But lately, I have gotten a lot better about eating a lot so i do not get fat. One thing you can start with is eating really slow, when you eat slow it fills you up faster, and drinking liquids when you are hungry fills you up too. The second you can do is find something else to do, like read or find a good t.v. show/movie to watch when you are bored so you do not feel like eating. O, if you run a mile each day that will also help you from gaining weight.|`|aY2KrGmyaa	haha. i have your same problem. me and my friends, were not hungry, we just like food! what i have done to change this problem is to eat small portions often. about every 2 hours. it really curbs my appetite. another idea is eat fuller substances. such as peanutbutter, it tricks your mind to thinking your full. so if you want to eat, just have a couple spoonfulls. at the very least make sure your eating healthy food! there are thousands of flavored foods that are good for you, if you do not like the healthy cardboard :P
Ztv1CIiOaa	It's normal. Seriously. No infection.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	It is important that you drink plenty of water each day.  Your urine should be almost clear and have very very little odor.  That will help a lot.  I have had kidney problems for a long time and every time I get that burning sensation, I buy a bottle of Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice Cocktail and it goes away.  Cranberries either in juice form or dried are great for urinary tract issues.  Try that.<br>  <br>  Every time you pass a water fountain take a drink...at home every time you pass the sink, drink a glass of water...watch, you will get better and feel so much better too.|`|Un511PNWaa	me too it's cleans out the urethra from the semen|`|nhOXFn9zaa	I think that you ejaculate when you want to pee... Id rather said acid urine can give you a burning sensation while youre ejaculatin... sometimes its normal... try to go to the bath before you have sex or smthing like that... drink much water helps to disolve your urine and it could not burn....<br>  if you cant understand me, sorry I am latinamerican....|`|MgMsMExPaa	This is common, I also have it . I think mine is from the urine stream forcing out the remaining semen that may be coating the urethra. Urine and semen also have different Ph levels and the two meeting could also cause some reaction. I have has this as long as I can remember.It really never seems to get better or worse.|`|78a5a61da0c084ee17a4bd8a260bb037aa	Did the doctor check you for a yeast infection?  If you are having unprotected sex your partner can spread an infection to you.  It happened to a friend of mine and her husband.
qrGLcTh4aa	The best thing for you to do is to eat on the other side. Don't chew anything on that side. Bring the crown and post into your Doctors office on Monday and they'll see what's going on. Hopefully, it as easy as re-cementing the crown.|`|RiwGi7hhaa	hmmm...I would put it back in place with some toothpaste maybe, just an idea|`|3jBNSmvBaa	The crown, build up, and post is what sounds like not the actual root canal fell out. you can use fixodent like for dentures and try to stick it back on but you will be ok to leave it out until monday morning, just be sure to call them asap dont wait you have a 72 hour time line before the root canal sealer starts to break down.
T4uZeVXjaa	It won't make you jaw bigger but it will make your genitals smaller.<br>  <br>  Bad idea.|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	at 19 years old your body is at its peak of testosterone production. there is no testosterone supplement that will really affect you since you are producing as much as your body already will. you can add muscle by (obviously) eating right and going to the gym. as far as the weak chin/jaw, thats genetics and get plastic surgery if you hate it that bad|`|GvEsaVYeaa	You will produce testosterone all your life. However, if you seem to think it is necessary to take a testosterone supplement, see a doctor and ask them. However, this just may be the way that your body will be. Not all males are muscular with a square jaw shape. Really, don't worry about it.|`|GKFv4G2uaa	Yes it wiil, but see a doctor.  I used the testosterone cream,<br>  It made my penis huge.  Got to be careful with that stuff.
