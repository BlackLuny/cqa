20090205192234AAm0ubk	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Electrical problems...certain appliances don't work?	Today, I was taking a break from my busy day to sit and watch some TV and have a cup of tea.  So, I plugged in my electric water heater for the tea and turned the TV on.  A few minutes later, out of nowhere, I lost electricity in my TV, my stereo, my living room lights, my toaster oven and the outlet where I plug my water heater.  Then, I noticed my wall phone in the kitchen is working, as are my coffee maker, my fridge and my stove top.  Then I went into the bathroom and found the lights weren't working in there, as well as the hall lights.  I couldn't get hold of anyone, so I went to the fuse box to see if there was a kicker.  But all the switches were switched to "on" and I checked all of them and none were out of place.  What could this be?  How can I fix it?

Also something my husband won't be embarrassed to shower in:D  I'm thinking about doing light pink and black now.  Can anyone point me in the direction of some nice accessories, shower curtains, wall art, etc that would match this scheme? any decor ideas would be greatly appreciated!

20090205181029AAvK5Wi	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	When replacing a light fixture, I found there is no bare copper ground wire.  Do I need to add one?	My laundry room has two switches, one powering a light fixture and one powering an exhaust fan.  Coming into the box for the switches are two wires: Red and White.  The power goes to the top of the first switch (fan) , then from there to the top of the second switch (light fixture) and from there out of the box into the garage.  The fan switch has an orange wire running up to the ceiling.  The light switch has a yellow wire running up to the ceiling.  There is a white neutral wire coming from the ceiling and the garage.  The three white wires are all connected (garage, ceiling and house).     I replaced both fixtures with a combination light fixture/exhaust fan.  The new fixture has a green grounding wire- Do I need to run a new wire for this?  If so, where to I connect it?

20090205192301AAdrkAq	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Rock salt 'stuck' in galvanized can - any way to remove it?	We live in northern USA and use rock salt on the sidewalks in winter to melt snow.  A few years ago we stored a 25-pound package-full of Morton rock salt in a small galvanized metal garbage can.  Somehow the salt got 'stuck' inside the can.  (Maybe the lid was open and it got wet inside?) It looks like the salt crystals all got melted together and got fused to the sides of the can.  I tried to hit chop away at it to break it up but hardly made a dent - it's really 'rock hard'.     Is there any way to get it out of the can?  Put water in it?  Or just throw the whole thing top down onto a hard surface and hope the big block of salt falls out?  Or something else?  If I could remove it and have it back into crystals, so i can use it, that would be great.  But if not I don't care if I have to throw it away.

It was built in 1923.  It has never been rewired or replumbed.  My Dad is 84 and thinks he can stay in this house forever.
