20070325192157AARAPf7	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Will We Ever HAVE the BIO-TECHNOLOGY to GROW TALLER?	Once the epiphyseal plates of the long bones have closed, further height is considered impossible. Considering that height, or lack thereof, has considerable sociological ramifications, will it be possible to one day "choose" our height? Many of you know that shorter people are on average paid less, date less, and are respected less. A recent study revealed that shorter people may even be less intelligent.       I already know about growth hormone for children, but the maximum height you can gain from it is 3". I'm too old for it as it is.      Can biotechnology, nanotechnology, future medical technology help allieviate this disease to the people it has already inflicted? We already have the "Ilizarov Method," or 'limb lenghtening' method as one form of primative invasive biotechnology.       Recently, an ultrasound device has been developed by scientists to regrow teeth. It may be one day used for people to gain height. Please read the attached link. When do you think this will happen?

What's the best way to explain she's disruptive	We're just a small craft group, but in addition to constantly talking about things that are way too personal for such a group, she jumps in on conversations going on across the room.  In addition, we are hosting a charity event and I thought I'd be helping her by letting her do some donation work, but instead, she ended up overstepping boundaries by conducting her own "investigation" of the charity since she had never hear of them and when I called to set everything up with the director, I had to apologize my way out of a mess.  What she did could have cost us ever being able to do another event like this.  I did sit her down and talk to her, but all I got was "deer in the headlights" look and as we left the meeting, she was talking about finding a sponsor for our event, which as the organizer is my job.  I have no clue what to do with this person. Any suggestions?

No, non ho sbagliato, si intitola proprio così...ed è a voi che appunto chiedo come mai l'hanno intitolata così, anzichè the way YOU are, come sarebbe corretto...

Se que la opinión no es generalizada, pero veo que muchas de las personas al emitir una opinión al respecto se refieren a "closetera" y demás palabras evidentemente despectivas..      Por mi parte, cada quien es libre de expresar su forma de ser sin importar si la vida que leva como gay es pública o no a fin de cuentas el respeto por uno mismo se debe solo a la persona en si y no a nadie del entorno (sin afectarlos negativamente)      Si bien no asumo mi sexualidad públicamente estoy perfectamente conciente de que soy gay pero eso no quiere decir que tenga que decirle a medio mundo que lo soy...

Mi sono soffermato a pensare sulla religione cristiana... dal suo nome che inizia con "cristo" mi verrebbe da pensare che sia rivolta principalmente a Gesù, e in effetti credo che tutti i cristiani idolatrino gesù e Maria non meno di quanto idolatrano Dio... (o almeno, al catechismo insegnano le preghiere verso gesù e Maria e io questo lo chiamo idolatrare).   Siamo dunque politeisti? Non so perchè ma improvvisamente mi sento preso in giro.... Ci vantiamo tanto di essere monoteisti e invece idolatriamo più di una figura spirituale??

Chi non ha visto la finale del mondiale di calcio per club (Milan-Boca Juniors 4-2) probabilmente non saprà mai che, dopo aver segnato la rete del 3-1 al termine di una irresistibile azione personale, il pallone d'oro e neo-campione del mondo Kakà ha festeggiato la segnatura alzandosi la maglia e mostrando in mondo-visione la scritta 'I belong to Jesus' ('Io appartengo a Gesù'). Io non ne ho trovato traccia sui quotidiani di oggi e la cosa è strana, perchè i gesti di esultanza dei campioni di calcio sono oggetto da sempre di un'attenzione maniacale... Montella che fa l'aeroplanino, Totti che si succhia il pollice, Ravanelli che si copre la faccia con la maglia, i brasiliani ai mondiali che fanno il gesto della culla, Moriero che lucida le scarpe a Ronaldo... per non parlare poi del cucchiaio di Totti, delle bizze di Cassano, del gesto 'Ora vado via' di Trezeguet, del bacio di Blanc sulla pelata di Barthez... perchè solo il gesto del cristiano Kakà non merita menzione? E' pure Natale...

20090304065849AALb3gR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Will legalizing non traditional gay marriage lead to legalizing non traditional polygamy?	Divorce is banned in the Bible but runs rampant anyway so putting sin aside as a controlling issue, even though homosexuality & polygamy are also banned in the Bible, do you think legalizing gay marriage will lead to legalizing polygamy?  I wonder how many gay males are open to allowing their mate to have more than one 'spouse'!  And how many straight females are open to allowing their husband to have more than one wife!  Legalized polygamy isn't a one time 'threesome' experience, it's a lifetime of sharing the one you love with other 'legal' spouses!

American Hero; tall, bold and strong,   Proudly listening to his country’s song.   At only seventeen, he made a choice,   By listening to his inner voice.   Through hard work and determination,   He soon begins to defend his nation.   Personal sacrifice is day-to-day,   He wouldn’t have it any other way.   Consumed with tears and fears, he boards a plane,   The flight over seas will be a huge drain.   He boards the flight and hears the engine roar,   As he sets off on his first Iraq tour.   With hot, humid days, and cold lonely nights,   The haunting drams, he is learning to fight.   Being far away from family and friends,   Makes him want the war to come to an end.   Our letters and cards help him remember,   His family and friends that will leave him never.   When he comes home, and hears all of our cheers,   He’ll feel at peace for the first time in years.

As per abiogenesis, non living matter fused together to form the first cell, right?   But what stumps Scientist is how that cell learned how to multiply(where did RNA code come from), right?      Now if you think about it: Lets say RNA took millions-billions of years to become "perfected". How did a cell survive a year without being able to multiply? The only explanation is life started with a cell that already had RNA coded into it(but where did it come from).      This is the reason I believe in a creator. Is my logic unreasonable?

I mean, there are maaany girls i have met who denied Islam, but are now really good Muslims. And it was only the ages between teen life when they denied islam.

Its not the same feeling, and I don't get hard, but I do feel something in my body and in my little friend, and it seems sexual, especially because its only when I see a fit man's body. I've been wrestling with this because I know I feel this thing when I see fit men, but I know the little guy responds predominately to women, so I really don't know whats going on. I can see at this point that labels are bullshit, but still... is this what bi dudes feel?

20081007100137AAkr2J8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Legalizzando l'omosessualità aumenta la diffusione dell'AIDS?	La dottoressa Chiara Atzori, specialista di malattie infettive, tiene su Radio Maria uno spazio periodico in cui riceve telefonate e risponde alle domande degli ascoltatori. Rispondendo la settimana scorsa ad una ascoltatrice che si chiedeva se “legalizzare l’omosessualità” (come se si trattasse di una “droga leggera”) potesse aumentare la diffusione dell’Aids, la dottoressa ha risposto che “non sia ragionevole negare che nei paesi dove è avvenuta la normalizzazione dell’omosessualità, e quindi in qualche modo la depatologizzazione intesa come… così, equiparazione, un modo di essere come un altro, i risultati sanitari sono stati devastanti”, accennando a non meglio precisati “studi epidemiologici” degli USa e della Gran Bretagna. Secondo la dottoressa quindi la “normalizzazione dell’omosessualità” - con conseguente estensione dei diritti - “non fa altro che incrementare anche i comportamenti cosiddetti esplorativi”, dato che “in quel tipo di orientamento esiste una tendenza alla promiscuità, a comportamenti autodistruttivi, narcisistici, all’abuso di droghe, ecc.”. Sarebbe proprio la “normalizzazione” dei gay a incentivare “una gravissima forma di immaturità”, a incentivare “a livello educativo […] dei modelli che non sono buoni”. Atzori ci tiene a precisare che “dobbiamo essere realistici, al di là del credo religioso”: la concessione dei diritti agli omosessuali trasmetterebbe modelli educativi che fanno considerare “normale” l’omosessualità, che invece viene definita “una ferita”, una “patologia”.            SONO SENZA PAROLE; voi che ne pensate?
20081011200859AAYjrdm	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why is life so unfair?	My girlfriend and I kind of broke up (it's complicated) a couple days ago. We're both 18 years old. We're in a long distance relationship. She lives in North Hollywood, I live in Orange County. About an hour and a half away from each other. We both aren't able to drive. I take my behind-the-wheel driver's license test next Wednesday though. It's extremely difficult to see each other. The distance pains us (to make up for not seeing each other, we talk on the phone every single night, fall asleep on the phone together, and talk a lot on the computer), and it's the reason she wants to be just friends right now. Maybe there's more reasons, other emotional problems I'm sure. She doesn't know if she wants to be with me. Lately all she ever says is "I don't know what I want." I love her so much, but it feels impossible to let her go. She's my first everything; first kiss, first love, etc. I don't know what to do anymore. Today is our 7 month mark together. March 11, 2008 is when the journey began. I always hoped every night that it would never end, but my hope and faith seems to do me no justice. Why must life be so cruel and harsh to me? What am I doing wrong? I can't be with the one I love, and I try so hard. Maybe I try too hard. Maybe I need to stop trying to change fate and accept that I can never see her. What sucks even more is that I'm with someone my parents and the rest of my family would never accept, and I know that. I know my family. I'd be kicked out of the house and shunned forever. They don't know I'm into girls. And the way they'd react if they knew isn't right. Distance from the one you love is the worst thing anyone could ever ask for. To me, it's like I see her once every hundred years. When I'm not with her, my heart starts to break apart. But when I am with her, it's her who puts it together again. I can't let her go, nor will I ever. Maybe that is true love. I would choose the one I love over anyone in this world. All I need is her, and only her, for as long as I live.      Tell me what you think about my love life at the moment. My head is all over the place, but my heart remains in one spot; with my love.

20081029125736AAisamf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can I move past judgemental church members?	I left my abusive husband almost a year ago. I left the church I went to since the pastor and the church members blamed the abuse on me, or just didn't believe me. Now I want to seek a church again, but I am afraid because so many church goers (particularly those raised in the church) treat me like I am some sort of failure as a person. As well, I now live with a new man (we were originally room mates since we only know each other - we are both away from our families) and we are both building a relationship after having been abused by others. Again, this gets us lots of grief from some church goers. How can I handle this and the questions people ask?? Are there pastors who will embrace us and help us spiritually without judgement? Please don't tell me to ignore them, I am looking for advice, preferably from those with experience?

20090227030215AAifakR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this the mental image or picture you have of Jesus? Why or why not?	"Realities....There is a specific image of first-century Jesus I'd dare say most folks have ingrained in their minds. It's the image I grew up believing, and in speaking to people around the world, I've learned how common an image is. It's of a serene, mystical figure: manicured hands, perfectly combed hair, cascading white robes, rosy cheeks, arms stretched wide, gaze fixed heavenward, baritone-voiced, and divinely aloof."   - Extract taken from "In the Footsteps of Jesus - One Man's Journey Through the Life of Christ" by Bruce Marchiano

I am sorry if my earlier post was harsh and objectionable. I was in a hurry when I wrote it, this topic is something that I feel very strongly about, and after reading another person's response to my answer, I went back and read my own and was apalled at what I had written. I know that this apology cannot make up for my lack of respect in what I wrote, and I can only hope that those who read it can forgive me.      To me, this is one of the main issues of Y!A, and I feel that the debate, on some levels, represents how hard it is for so many different cultures to learn to get along. We will ALWAYS have these issues, and it is sometimes tiring to have them brought up time and time again. Why can we not just learn to accept that everyone is different, and that everyone does not express themselves in the same way? Is it not easier to accept that not everyone shares your point of view

Going back to my childhood, every childhood contest I was involved with whether it was for school, sports, Boy Scouts, treated it as the "everyone's a winner" concept. Every kid was declared a prize and there was no "winners" and "losers".      Now the question is why bother having a competition where everyone will turn out the winner? In my younger adulthood now I don't necessarily agree with this because i feel it is good to show your kids that not everyone excels in everything that they do and to learn the concept of accepting defeat. If you win at everything you attempt you wouldn't know how to accept defeat as you get older, respectfully.      How do you other parents feel on the "everyone's a winner" thing being used?

20070509135611AASsnrI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	God has a reason for everything.?	God has a reason for everything.  This is a phrase that we hear a lot from Christians.        A few months ago, in the City I live in, three small children died when the home they were living in burned down.  On the news, you could see the mother of the children outside fighting to get past the firemen so that she could get in to save her babies.  The firemen had to keep her back because they knew that if she went in she would die too.  The autopsy report showed that the children died from burns.        Don’t get me wrong, I do not think that any God did this.  But if you are going to say that “God does everything for a reason” in any situation, you are automatically saying that God did that to those children and their mother.  So tell me what reason could he possibly have for that?  Try not to use any clichés like “God works in mysterious ways.”  So, maybe some things do just happen by chance…  If so, I wonder how God decides when he will intervene and when he will leave things to chanc

20081102184237AAM5UF7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people call Allah the moon god or the Muslim God?	The Arabic word "Allah" translates to "The God". While the word "Elah" (the "Al" prefix is the definite article) in Arabic would mean "God", which is equivalent to the word "Eloah" in Hebrew. That being said, all Arabs, regardless of religion, call on their God by the name Allah. This includes Jewish, Christian, Muslims, etc. Within the Bible and the Torah in Arabic, the word "Allah" is used in place of "God".      So why is it that people associate the name "Allah" merely with those who are Muslims, or the religion of Islam? Why do they call Him the "Muslim God" when He is also the God of Judaism and Christianity?      Another question I had was why do some people claim that "Allah" is the moon god worshiped by the pagan Arabs thousands of years ago? The pagan Arabs worshiped other gods which they had separate names for. So why are people having this misconception on the true meaning of "Allah"?

Within the last few years I have found myself attracted to men more and more. Sometimes I am attracted to women but I am attracted to men 95% of the time. I have never really put my self out there. Does anybody have any advice for a first-timer? (as in never asked a guy out)       There is this one guy that I kinda like but I don't think he really knows it I could not stop thinking about him for about two weeks after I met him. I don't know really if it is lust or love.   Thanks for any advice.

Pedophiles would rather be with a child than an adult relationship.      I have also asked this before but will attach this in here as well.

Ok so i have 1 speech in my French class and my speech is the following, if you could help me translate in french the would be awesome thanks.!!!            School is an educative place where you learn a series of things, which also will help you in the future. In some cases when you go to school you find your best friend. In school there are some pretty interesting classes, for example music, science, math, and history. Personally I like music a lot. Some teachers are very nice, and can always learn from their experiences.  In school you can join clubs  where you can get to know more people. For most of the pupils lunch is their favorite time at school, and it's because you can meet with your friends and hang out together. Finally school is like my second home, I enjoy going, and it's helpful to become someone in life.

When doing business via e-mail in a foreign country (making a hotel reservation, restaurant reservation, etc.), is it considered more polite to communicate in the native language of that country?      For example; I am an American, but I am making reservations in Peru. By making the extra effort to correctly translate my communications into Spanish, is this considered more polite?      Realistically, Spanish is the language they usually do business in. Someone at the business MIGHT speak English, but it seems to be more polite to address them in the language they are accustomed to.      Imagine how an American business would react to receiving reservation requests in Spanish, or in Portuguese...they might not even bother trying to translate it.      What do you think? Am I right to do this?

20090305063250AAuXStL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do boxing fans and a lot of Christians have in common?	1. Boxing fans can tell you almost everything about boxing. A lot of Christians can tell you almost everything about the bible.   2. Boxing fans can tell you almost everything about their favorite boxers. A lot of Christians can tell you almost everything about Jesus and most of the characters in the bible.   3. Boxing fans can tell you how to block, when to duck, what punch to throw and how to counterattack. A lot of Christians can tell you how to cast out demons, heal the sick, praise and worship the Lord.   4. Boxing fans know boxing better than the fighters themselves. A lot of Christians have this belief that they know Jesus and his teaching better than Jesus himself. (Well what Jesus meant to say was).   5. Boxing fans love to imitate boxers. A lot of Christians love to imitate Jesus.   6. Boxing fans will sit at ring side and scream out moves to the boxers as if he was the boxer himself. A lot of Christians will tell you scripture after scripture as if they were Jesus Christ himself.   7. A lot of boxing fans would read a book dealing with a boxer skills, and will tell you what the boxer should be doing or what the boxer shouldn’t be doing. Even though it is not in the boxer manual. A lot of Christians will add in or remove scripture from the bible telling the believers what they should or shouldn’t be doing even though it is not in the bible. (You need to strive or try for perfection)    8. A high percentage of boxing fans (from one to nine) have never boxed a day in their lives. A high percentage of Christians (from one to nine) have never step foot outside the four walls of the church to evangelize.   9. If you were to ask a lot of boxing fans about putting on the gloves and go one on one with a boxer themselves. A lot of them (from one to nine) will have a lot of excuses of why they couldn't go one on one with a boxer. If you were to ask a lot of Christians, about going out and ministering and befriended a non-believer, a homeless person, a family in need. A lot of them (from one to nine) will have a lot of excuses of why they couldn't or won't go out among the lost.   A lot of Christians and a lot of sporting fans have a lot in common when it comes to lip service and nothing more. This is why you don't see a lot of boxers but you see a lot of boxing fans and wanna be boxers. This is why you don't see a lot of followers of Christ, but you see a lot of Jesus wanna be and a lot of Jesus fans.   From one to the eight. A lot of sports fan has knowledge, but little to no experience when it comes to actually doing the sport themselves. From one to the end. A lot of Christians has knowledge, but little to no experience when it comes to evangelizing or ministering outside the four walls. Doing any kind of activity will make you a better person in whatever you do. Talking about it, will always leave you on a level of you being just a talker.    Christ didn't die for talkers or fans.
20090305073244AAgEM7G	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why were the things that were funny then, not funny now?	I recently watched a couple of sit-coms from my youth that I thought were really funny at the time, but now not only are they not funny, they were kind of stupid and silly.    Does humor/comedy "age"? Like even the big hits for sitcoms on tv back then, would never be funny now, let alone big hits in today's times.   Like take a show like A.L.F, Family Ties, Night Court, or Perfect Strangers that were huge back when I was a kid/teen, but would be unfunny flops if they tried coming out now for the first time.      It makes me think of what kind of things will be funny in future generations, ya know?

Not wanting to make others think i'm changing my beliefs.So trust me this is only a hypothetical Question not meant to anger or insult but only to read others views on it.So my Question is> Since the Jews even today believe they have the only one true faith and then 2100 yrs ago Christ comes and Starts a new Belief and Proclaims his way is the only way and the 600 yrs after Christ comes the Muslims and they in turn claim they have been sent to correct and teach the real truth with 900 yrs after them comes the Protestants(Protesters)Claiming the Church Christ started is now corrupt and now they have the real truth do you not now understand why others look at religion as a human created beliefs?
20090305075807AA95E0w	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Last Question: If some dude started saying he was Jesus, Christians, would you believe him?	I guess what i'm asking is if the Bible is word for word what will happen. Could Jesus come down randomly but it wasn't in the Bible. And if so, would you believe such a person?      I heard that when Jesus first started saying he was the son of God, people thought he was a crazy person.       Would you think the same if some guy said it to you...what if it really was Jesus. Would you be damned for denying him?

20090305064247AADfL3w	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Speaking to GOD in your thoughts, but sometimes you just have enough?	i have a strong bond with GOD and sometimes when im alone i just speak to him in my thoughts or just let my thoughts out. when i'm really really low, i can hear him in my thoughts speaking to me, but sometimes cos im really really low i just tell him to leave me for a while and to stop speakin to me for a while, and i also do this with my friends as i like time to myself when im feelin really down.      is it wrong to sometimes say no to GOD in your thoughts when your just tired of religion and god constantly getting involved in your thoughts when your feeling low, as if it will save you from everything immediatly. i am really close to losing hope   i dont want any copy and paste of bible verses.

Theres a school board meeting next week to decide if they should cut back some classes, including, art classes, spanish classes, and music classes. Of course, us as students, arnt too happy about that. So theres alot of us going to the meeting. My friends and I wanted to make tshirts, and we need some ideas. Our band teacher said that there cutting his jobs to about 62% of his normal salary. So one of our ideas is to iron on 'sixtytwo percent" onto a shirt, and cut it all up. And stuff like "Save The Arts" We need ideas for signs, and shirts. Anything would really be a big help. It was also suggested that we stop at about 62% of the way through our musical. And say, this is what our music program will be like. So you think about that while you sit in the dark.  So any suggestions on what we can do would be a HUGE help.

20090305064713AAugI0g	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Any one else stuck on a soap box, pounding their head against a wall?	I am so irritated with the closed minds of people lately.  Why can't they just admit talents and gifts are normal even if the talent is supernatural and outside of the norm?  These talents have always been around, just not as public as lately.  Most of the time they are suppressed in our childhoods by those who don't want a freak in the family.  I find this to be so harmful to the child.  It affects their whole life.  Talents should be nurtured and if you don't know how then find help...if the child was good at music you would get them Instruments why not the same with psychic abilities?  I also think this would minimize the use of dark magic because they would understand how it affects themselves and harms more than just the intended.  Knowledge is power.      May you be blessed.

Explain in English how different finger-counting is in your own country compared to France. Does one way make more sense than another? I don't know the differences. When French people count on their fingers, they start with their thumb for number one, index for two, middle finger for three, ring finger for four and pinky for five. The thumb is always used to show one, index for two etc...Americans use their index to start finger-counting or sometimes their pinky. What's the difference to them and why?

20090305064943AArVS6c	Society & Culture;Languages	Question on Grammar - Which is correct?	My nephew's composition about World War II was edited by his English teacher but I feel that the teacher had made a mistake. Please help to read the following options and tell me the correct answer with a clear explanation. Thank you.       This was what he wrote in (1) and the teacher's version in (2):      1) How I wish there WERE peace and harmony back then! If only there WERE peace and harmony, there would not be scenes of bloodshed!       2) How I wish there WAS peace and harmony back then! If only there WAS peace and harmony, there would not be scenes of bloodshed!       As you can see, his teacher changed the word 'WERE' to 'WAS'. Both my sister and I feel that it is incorrect to look at the 2 uncountable nouns of 'PEACE AND HARMONY' to determine the use of 'WAS' because the focus here is talking about 'peace and harmony' which HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE during the Japanese Occupation and thus using "WERE" is more appropriate because it is just a wishful thinking on one's part or a hypothesis at most.           Now, tell me, is (1) our judgement or (2) the teacher's judgement correct?

20090305071752AA8oEAe	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do people judge you at face value, even when they don't know you?	I mean it's shallow. Sometimes I feel like wearing nice clothes, and being all fashionable, and I get judged by these angry women who are like "Oh grow up!" Little do they know I'm 27, a grown man, and I did great in school and I'm great in life too.       But just because I looked and acted immature on that one day and time,....the judgement is set.      See that's my problem with society. they're d7mb. They don't understand that people look certain ways intentionally, or accidentally, or whatever, they don't seem to understand that there's more than meets the eye, or that things are more than they appear.      They just judge.      it's really annoying because, what, are we all supposed to dress like adult corporate drones or something once we reach a certain age?      It's really disturbing. It really is because it takes the fun out of life, because people are st7pid and judgemental. So waht, even if you were young and immature, that's where you currently are in life, so what's wrong with that? Are you going to listen to some hateful...I won't even say it, and change so that she likes you?      People all think how they think and have their own prejudices and judgements...and unfortunately that's the world we live in.         So what's wrong with just "hey if you don't like me, shove it up your...." and go on with your day?         I mean really, yes you should look serious at work and certain places, I mean there are certain rules and norms which really should be respected ,but...      people really suck. that's all I can say.
20090305075834AAeqZiT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Death in the Garden of Eden?	I would ask that all who read this try and limit their replies to the question and not a debate of creationism. If your intellectual limitations prevent this please go earn two points elsewhere. On to the question.      I have been looking over the answers in Genesis website and a question arose. The AiG website teaches that there was no death before the fall. Thus there could be no possibility of a pre-Adamite world in which there was death. However in the garden Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the trees. Fruit is composed of living cells and when plucked from a tree they begin to die. When eaten the cells are killed. So at the very least there was death of fruit in the garden. Doesn't this disprove the no death before the fall idea? Couldn't the verses used to support the no death just refer to humans?

In Christianity we take our lessons from JESUS CHRIST not a man sitting in Rome who's never had sex who tells his worshippers they can't use contraception.      If JESUS CHRIST isn't telling you the answer then should try get nearer to him. JESUS CHRIST talks to Christians and guides Christians so if you need a pope it means you're not listening to JESUS CHRIST enough.

Mainly how do u show interest in someone you don't talk much to. nothing in common either.    2) How do you get the message across to certain people that your interested but not completely show it?   3) On messenger should you make your personal messages mysterious and hint u like the same gender or your taken.

20090305063058AAcqoGP	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How would you deal with this workplace disrespect?	Yesterday, I phoned my boss to let him know that a product one of his customers had ordered had been discontinued.  He told me to put the customer's order in his box, and that he would deal with it later..      This morning, his wife (co boss) called into the office and asked to speak to this other girl that worked in the office.  She was asking about the discontinued product, and wanted to know who ordered it, and wanted  to let the customer knew that it was discontinued.  I overheard the conversation and I told my co worker      "Yes, that product had been discontinued" and she was like "Yeah, we know that. Did sales rep call that order in?"  I didn't like the way she said "yeah, we know that"  So,  I didn't answer her question. The she went on to ask me a bunch of questions about the product..      Sooo,  why couldn't the boss just ask me about it instead of connecting to the other girl, and having the other girl hollering across the office to ask me questions about?  Does that make sense?      I felt disrespected..

Have you ever bothered to read just what kind of treaties and laws are being passed? Are your liberties being eroded away due to "terrorism"?   Has the media brainwashed you with it's cult? Are you a victim of deception? Have you given up what you value to put some food on the table? Well, here's how it's going to go. We are in a the greatest depression, there is talk about the internet being taken over by big corporations, radio talkshow hosts such as Alex Jones and Alan Watt may not be allowed on the air for much longer, due to the new laws being brought in to restrict freedom of speech.    Global warming was dreamed up as a way to unite man against an enemy, including private banker David Rockefeller, part of the club of Rome one of the private bankers that control the cash flow and a member of the council of foreign relations that are buying off the world and setting up a one world government, yes, it's called "globalisation", look it up. Also look up the "chemical warfare treaty" which permits the governments to spray us with chemicals from the sky. They also seek to control the weather. Here is the quote from the club of Rome;   "In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill…. But in designating them as the enemy, we fall into the trap of mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.

I hid my identity because I didn't anyone the know about me being gay.    It all started when I had seen a lesbian group(its the only lesbian group that exist) in my country. I decided to join the site and went about creating a fake name, "TRACY".. My society is not very accepting of gay people and I feared about what the world will think about me if they came to know I'm gay. & the main reason about me creating a fake name was because my name is very uncommon..and almost everyone knows me.

20090305062516AA9tID7	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What does the state have to gain by attempting to prevent kids from being home schooled if their parents wish?	Something to this effect happened in California awhile back.  I'm not really sure what's in it for the state (any state) to try and prevent parents' children from being home schooled.  There are extremely good, valid, and perfectly legal reasons for this much healthier alternative to "the system", which does little if anything to actually help children succeed in PRACTICAL ways.  Mostly, having your child in public school today will only guarantee that they will be bullied and suffer from low self-esteem, which all too often carries into their lives after high school.  In short, you have to ALREADY be accepted by your peers (by being a great athlete or at the absolute minimum have the wind to your back).  If not, you're screwed, and everyone knows it.  I don't blame any parent for wanting to shape their kids' minds and emotions THE RIGHT WAY, contributing to a very healthy outlook on life that they will otherwise not receive.  Why do you think that public schools continue to get worse?  It's because the problems going on in these institutions are being denied, overlooked, and swept under the rug.  It's long past time to wake up, people.

I've been dating this really great guy for about six weeks now.  So far we h ave only taken this relationship physically to the point of making out and cuddling.        Because we click so well, I can foresee this going to sexual activity in the neat future.  But the problem is, I am really scared of STDs.  I've been thoroughly tested and know that I don't have any; I am, however, not sure of the status my new boyfriend - I know he's a fairly experienced person, so maybe he has some STD even though it's not obviously visible.       I guess the best thing to do would be to have him get thoroughly tested before we engage in anything.  But what about this idea: use plastic wrap (i.e. cling-wrap / saran-wrap that you use in the kitchen) to cover body parts during physical contact?  For example, if we have anal sex, I know that a condom will do a very good job at protecting against HIV and some other STDs, but there are a few that condoms do not protect against.  Can I just wrap my entire hip region (or at least the genital area) in plastic wrap after I put a condom on (or before I put it on???) to avoid any physical contact that might transit STDs?  Would I want to put the condom on under or over the plastic wrap?      I know this sound ridiculous, but I just want to somehow make our sex close to 100% safe.  Yes, I know abstinence would be safer.  But this would be fun...      Thanks for the help!

First you buy a gun,and some bullets.Lock the door,Shake off your fears,now put the barrel on your lips.Feel your warmth upon the cold heartless steel.Now this part is very important(so listen closely),pull the trigger,hear the sound of the eternal click.And watch has the pretty patterns appear,from the emptiness that was your head.I hope this helps you.

20090305080300AAhc2VC	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why don't more African Americans like House Music?	I have been enjoying house music, parties and clubs for 15 years. While there are notable African American House DJs there doesn't seem to be that much acceptance or enjoyment going on in the black community. Most of the fans, club goers and party attendees seem to be Caucasian/Euro, Latin or Asian.       This seems strange to me as House Music is rooted in Disco, Funk and Soul. An AA DJ once told me that cultural homophobia keeps most AA males from enjoying or participating in the House Music community but that seemed to be a subjective comment. Can anyone clue me?

If God/Nature saw fit to take from a women the ability to conceive, isn't just as morally wrong to "play God" to the other side of the spectrum?...         It would seem out of place for faith based people to use modern medicine to slap Gods will in the face, so to speak.
20090305081653AAldKBc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A Muslim husband can hit his wife?	The husband has no right to harm his wife physically; it is not permissible for him to hit her except in the case where other means of correction have  failed, such as warning her and forsaking her in her bed. If hitting becomes permissible, then it should not be done with the intention of causing harm, rather the intention should be to rebuke and discipline. Hence it is stipulated that it should not be a blow that leaves a mark or causes pain. But hitting should not be resorted to except in extreme cases.
