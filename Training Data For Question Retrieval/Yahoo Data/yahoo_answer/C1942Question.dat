20090219141706AAXOtaI	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Friends phone never receives text messages?	'Never' was a bit over the top. However we are both on the same network (Orange) as are most of my friends, we all have good coverage so it isn't that. But, if I send a text to her phone she will either:      -Get it (Success)   -Never receive it (No Success)   -Or get it hours, even days later. (Annoying)      The phone is a LG Secret (KF750) I think. She also has trouble phoning people with it, sometimes it will just leave a long beep instead of a ringing tone and she can't text people directly, she has to reply to a previous text message (this isn't a joke).       As far as I know this is all the problems, is it the phone? Or is it something to do with the network? And is there any way to solve it?      Thanks in Advance

I know did everything right in connecting with my laptop, (4-5 weeks on Youtube,Microsoft,Xbox.com) But there still seems to be an error.       Now its decision making time:      Since i can't use my laptop to connect, and I'm not going wired,    Is it worth $100 to get that wireless adapter?      What I'm scared of is:   If I've had problems before connecting wirelessly with my laptop, will I have problems connecting with the new Xbox 360 Wireless Adapter?      What do I do????
20090220083358AA9nYBJ	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Buying an Unlocked/ Sim-Free Phone in NYC - Please help!?	Hi There. I'd like to buy an unlocked/ sim-free cell-phone in Manhattan or Brooklyn while I'm there to be used overseas. Probably a Sony Ericsson, but nothing too top of the line. I don't want to buy it from some guy off the street, but rather from a reputable seller.      I know these phones are sold at full retail, but do you know of any shops/places where I could get a good deal on one without having to sign a contract?      Thanks in advance!

20090220090742AARpWQs	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Am I entitled to a refund here?	I bought a mobile phone at the end of October and I began having trouble with it just after Christmas - I brought it back to the shop and they sent it for repair, got it back 2 weeks later and it was still faulty so I brought it back again. I had to wait another 2 weeks to get it back and when I did it only lasted a few days before the fault happened again!!   Again I brought it back to the shop, I spoke to one of the managers and he said he would have to send it back again!! I explained that it was my 3rd time back, I had my receipt..blah blah blah and could I not just get it exchanged or refunded so I wouldn't have to wait another 2 weeks, he told me that they don't give refunds - they just send them back for repairs.   Surely this can't be right, should I be entitled to a refund if the goods are still faulty??   I would really appreciate some advice, especially if anyone works for a mobile phone store.      (the fault is that the phone keeps powering off of its own accord,with a full battery,dealing with a Meteor store)

As for the Nikon d90 compared to the Canon 40d, I have no preference between these two.        I need help in picking which one to get.  As I would be shooting indoor, portrait, and landscape.        Should I wait for another camera to come out?      Thanks, any suggestions?

My mp3 player will still charge through USB, but when I try to update the firmware it says that there's no player connected.

I get the same problems on both laptops.
20090220112723AAwO9dR	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Sound quality of a recording studio.?	Hi, I just got a external sound card for my laptop.      overall it sounds really great, huge improvement over the onboard sound, and it is good enough for me to record my own music, or record a demo.      It sounds great when I have it plugged in listening through my headphones, but then when I take out the soundcard and run the sound through my laptop speakers and it completely sucks like it used to almost.      How come the recording studios can record with a  great soundcard, and then when you play their song on the computer the quality is still good, even though I am playing it through my laptop speakers?

20090203081138AA7oVwO	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	When buying a "big" camera (big black 10MP + ones etc) what specification should i look for?	As you can see by the title i know nothing about cameras.   I want to buy a really good camera with about 10 - 14 megapixels however i dont know what else to look for.      The camera would be used mainly for close-up/macro pictures and would need to connect to a computer to digitally upload pictures.      The reason for asking is because there was a 10.2MP sony camera on amazon reduced from something like ￡400 to ￡250 yet there was a 10.2MP nikon one for ￡800 =/ so i am guessing there is more to cameras than just megapixels..?      So basically, what do you need to look for in a reasonably decent camera? (not a super camera... just a good one)   Thankyouuu :)

I'm getting a new phone this early summer, I know they will most likely come out with new stuff by then.. haha    my dad says i should get a blackberry.. cause the rest of the family has them and love them..    two of them have the curve, and another has the storm.     I prefer the storm..    But.. its still SOOO big.. i like small phones.. really..    I saw a SMALLER one in AT&T.. but still not small.. Idk what it was called? it was silver.. and kinda looked like a regular phone with a keyboard.     but its still a little big..    in my mind i want a slider phone, that slides down.. and instead of the numbers, it has a keyboard.. but i haven't seen anything like that yet..    Feel free to give me ideas, and pictures are good! :) thanks.

20090220114933AA87noO	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Won't my 900/1800 dual-band phone work in China?	I have a dual band cell phone that is 900/1800.  It worked in Europe, and based on what I’ve been reading it should also work in China (with a local SIM card).  However, the Chinese company from which I’m renting the SIM card said that a dual-band phone will never work in China, and that instead I need a tri-band or quad-band.  I thought they were wrong so I emailed the phone manufacturer (Motorola) to confirm my phone would work in China, but they keep telling me that according to their system, my phone should be a 850/1900 and it’s not a 900/1800.  Well, I have the phone and the packaging and I know they’re wrong too; my model has two versions and I have the “non-American” version which their rep seems unfamiliar with.  However, frankly I don’t want to go to China assuming everyone else is wrong if there is a chance I’m missing something.  In short, shouldn’t a 900/1800 phone that worked in Europe also work in China?  And why is the SIM company saying dual-bands in general can’t work in China?  Is that always (or never) the case?  Thanks for any insight you can give.

Although my house is wired for regular rj11 and the existing alarm system is hooked up to it, I have no intention of purchasing phone service.  There's no reason to since everyone has cell phones, and it would be stupid to pay a monthly fee for a service that is only used for an alarm.      Does anyone know if there's a product out there that either converts existing RJ31X to function over the internet, or an alarm system that uses internet to communicate alarm status to whatever service.       I am aware of the cellular options, but apparently that alone is an expensive upgrade that adds another 'line' to you house.  Not interested in that.

I only picked up one hdmi cable (after blowing about 1000 bucks on all this), and hooked up the dvd player using the hdmi port and my Xbox to the component video ports.      Everything works fine, I start playing my Xbox, and I start getting periods of "no signal".  It happens in totally random intervals and not all the time.      Is this an issue with the tv?  Did I "loosen" a connection by plugging the dvd player into the hdmi port?      I haven't tried the Xbox in the hdmi, which I should do, but I'm really more concerned for the tv.  30 days is fast approaching and i'd like to swap it out if possible.  Thanks in advance.
