EVh1rskCaa	I totally agree, I think Italy winning the 2006 WC is a testament to that, dirtiest WC victory ever.  I notice more and more teams just diving and crying, I think that it makes it especially hard on defenders since players flop so often now.  I mean, when players start diving when no one touches them it is definately out of control (yes, I'm talkin about Henry, for as great of a striker that he is).  FIFA definately need to step in and take control of the ridiculous play and favoritism with certain teams and players.|`|YgYpSpnLaa	I agree, some players do that<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  I think you're like a lot of Canadian fans... you don't realize exactly how things work. As a player, I'll tell you, things like that happen and you'll be in pain but the pain can go away real fast and make you look like a liar. I think people always pretend like they know everything and that players should be tougher but honestly? A lot of the times it is being hurt but needing a few mins to recover.<br>  <br>  But I did see a lot of crappy diving from Czech Rep. And even from Panama. :X <br>  <br>  But I HATE IT when stupid ignorant fans dont realize how hard it is for some players to go so fast without falling with one touch... or how pain can go away quick. I agree that Italians dive like there's no tomorrow but still, a lot of teams that look like theyre diving may not be.|`|9e2wVGeYaa	its not just you.<br>  <br>  the game is changing, its an evolution
d9f2ceb4ad4903a76d164c2609622d3daa	A hit and run is simple: man on any base and a hitter at the plate that can make contact. The runner is put in motion as if he is going to steal before the pitch and the batter swings to make contact, preferably for a hit. If the batter doesn't swing then it becomes a straight steal attempt for the runner.|`|THvp6whsaa	Its like a bunt but fast, with the ball aimed at the ground, and with the intent to advance base runners.  Usually tried when runners are on base (sometimes loaded).  You're not going for a home run, just advancing runners (assume the batter will be out at first).|`|UZ39hyuxaa	A hit and run is a play where the runners move on the pitch, but as opposed to attempt a steal, they want the batter to swing, and give the runners a head start.<br>  <br>  It has several advantages, as the effect of holding at first, and awaiting a throw at second opens up the infield so more hits can pass. It also gives the runner a head start, to avoid double plays, or reach third on a single more easily.<br>  <br>  The disadvantages are that on a SO, the runner's on his own, and must steal second, not usually on a pitch he likes. Also, lining into a double play is very dangerous.|`|cxLbfm0kaa	It is when a runner is running and the hitter is supposed to hit the ball in play to advance the run and maybe get a run.|`|166f422b0bc0b16025c5b18f6250ee8faa	when you swing at a pitch so that a runner on base can advance. Even on a ball you swing so that it is harder for the catcher to throw out the runner on the steal.|`|76cwEydtaa	A hit and run is when a runner steals, At the same time the batter swings at the next pitch no matter what the location. If the batter gets a base hit, the runner has a chance to advance another base. The hit and run is mostly called on a 2 and 1 count.|`|AA11057270	A hit and run is a play in baseball where the baserunners are put in motion before the ball is hit and the batter attempts to make contact with the pitch. However, if the ball is unhittable such as if it is thrown in the dirt or it is thrown high above the batter's head and the batter is unable to make contact, the batter does not have to swing. The hit and run is usually employed when a good contact hitter is at the plate. Often, on a hit-and-run play the batter will try to "hit behind the runner" by hitting the ball to right field which makes it more likely that the runner will be able to go from first to third on a single, or even score from first on a double. Another goal of a hit and run is to open up holes in the infield for the batter to hit the ball through, since either the shortstop or second baseman will have to cover second base when they see the runner moving.<br>  <br>  Hit and run plays are most frequently used by teams without many power hitters in the lineup, as they may have to "manufacture runs" this way on occasion.<br>  <br>  If the batter does not make contact, then the runner is left to attempt a stolen base on his own, and he may be caught. Even a very fast runner who can normally steal a base is more likely to be caught stealing if the batter does not make contact. A hit and run play is communicated in advance to both runner and batter and thus the runner is not able to wait for a proper pitch to get a good 'jump' as with a normal steal attempt. Conversely, the batter is not able to select a good pitch at which to swing because he must make contact to cover the runner's advance.|`|Apw0sUzEaa	Runner's in motion and the hitter's instruction is to make contact with the ball just before the pitch is delivered.|`|aBJDqwq6aa	Though it's called 'hit and run', in actuality it's 'run and hit'.<br>  A base runner will try to advance as the ball is pitched.<br>  The batter will try to make contact with the ball, preferably a ground ball.|`|dPpxoIdgaa	you got some bad answers to this question....almost always there is a runner on first.  before the pitch the runner is instructed to try and steal and the batter will swing at whatever pitch comes his way.  if the batter gets a single, the runner can usually get to third and on a double should score.  if the batter swings and misses, that runner better hope he gets to second before the throw.

E1jGXzLkaa	This just moved Gallardo to the bullpen, but I don't like this move. I don't approve of taking a rookie off of his game and make him go from knowning when he going to start to just waiting in the bullpen for the coach to tell him to start warming up. I think it would've been better to move Vargas to the bullpen and him be the long reliever. Vargas has been to inconsistant. He will have a great outing one week and the next have a bad one. His last two starts he has 10er's on 10 inngs, two 5er's and 5 innings performances. And like you said Dave Bush could be turning a corner, he was a stud for them last year so he deserves more time to see how he will do.|`|CKP98samaa	Gallardo is a stud, and he's proven he can pitch at the major league level.  It won't hurt to have him up, but the Brewers proved that they can win without him.  Why not put Gallardo in the bullpen?  And if one of the starters happens to struggle, the Brew Crew can just swap whoever it is with Gallardo until they find their form again.

Like Mark Clayton in Baltimore he is clearly the go to guy now over Derrick Mason. I am targeting Chris Chambers in my drafts because I think with Trent Green now he has a ligit chance to but up true #1 receiver numbers, he's had all the tools except for the QB. I am suprised you did not mention D. J Hackett from Seattle in either your of your articles about 3rd year receivers and than sleepers. He is poised to breakout as a third year receiver w/ Hasselback as the QB and Shaun Alexander doesn't catch many passes out of the backfield. Teams will double team deion branch leaving D J Hackett with one on one coverage to take advantage of. Your right about Chad Johnson  though, T J "Who's your mama" is neck and neck with Chad Johnson in the fantasy world plus I think TJ missed the first two games last season.|`|Q64dh6K8aa	I dont think Deion Branch will have 75 catches for 100 yards|`|gRbfEUhIaa	Clayton, Driver, and Moss should be a little higher. Marvin Harrison should be #1 and Steve smith #2. Clayton is going to be great this year. Driver is usually in the top 10 wr's. Moss is going to be amazing this year with tom brady. Harrison always does the best, I don't think smith has a chance to be #1. I think Calvin Johnson should be up there somewhere too.

58f457cc39b78ee477747bbda334f377aa	i dont know if your school has a kicker coach (doesnt sound like it) but we did and we've had a bunch of success. following through with kicking like a soccer ball (not toe) like the pros do helps with power and will improve accuracy over toeing it. i would have been kicker (im going into junior year this year, my fresh year-we had a kicker i almost took over for becuase he was hurt, soph year-freshmen who could just make bombing kicks (made a 50 yarder in prac, 40 in game).  Try watching the pros style and do that and follow through the kicks. a coach helps alot but again idk if you have one.|`|zVyWLaU9aa	The only thing you can really do to work on your kicking skills is to just take a ball to a football field and start kicking it through the uprights man.

EVh1rskCaa	I think it depends.  The first thing you might want to do is try both boots out, see which footy boot fits you better, because simply put you will play worse in a boot that is uncomfortable.  Both boots have very clean striking services though I do not know how "great" the Nike S.P.P thing really works.  In all honest I would think both boots shoot very similar and it is more dependent on your skill as a player. <br>  <br>   The Total 90 Lasers, are more expensive boots, the F50.7 Tunits is a cheaper boot but to my understanding the removable studs have a tendancy to fall out if you do not tighten them before every match or practice, so that is something you might want to consider.  <br>  <br>   Both boots are pretty low maintainace, the upper on both boots is very easy to take care of, the things you might want to consider though with ease of care is the studs on the F50.7 and if you get the kangaroo leather Total 90 Lasers then you will of course have to take care of the kangaroo leather with some leather food every now and then to keep them in top shape.  <br>  <br>  If money is a consideration then I might recommend the F50.7 over the Total 90 Lasers, however I really recommend going with which ever boot feels right to you.|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	go for the Tunits ;)|`|4e480b74ca0fc042cdbe321c54b8f41baa	Dude get the Tunits i own a pair and not only do they feel like if your bare foot when your playing, you will also be styling too, seriously.|`|9adae3e8af653835dbb7b393e9c0cf16aa	I have the F50.7 Tunits and have had them for over a year.  Not once have I had a problem with studs falling out.  They are great cleats they fit real nice and snug, and the stud changing thing is really simple and easy to do.  <br>  <br>  Onto the Lasers.  Honestly, I have no idea how the new sweet spot thing works, having some target circles on the uppers of your cleats.  And the "new" sweat technology thing doesn't really that impressive.<br>  <br>  All in all, you should try on the pairs first.  Forget everything you heard about studs falling out it only happens if you're really ignorant and have absolutely no idea how to turn the stud changer the correct way or if you just have no idea how to treat cleats (i.e. you shouldn't have those cleats because you aren't a decent or good soccer player).

UZ39hyuxaa	Slugging average is total bases over at bats (Slg = TB / AB)<br>  <br>  It's a weighted average that gives a good idea of overall power.<br>  TB = 1B + 2 * 2B + 3 * 3B + 4 * HR|`|AFdAFZQYaa	Basically slugging % is total combined hits divided by a combination of extra base hits. One "whole hit" would consist of a fraction of 4/4. In order to have a 1.000 slugging percentage, then that batter would have to hit a homerun. Four out of four total bases allowed maximum at one time. A double would be considered 2/4 for a slugging percentage of .500. A triple is 3/4 for a .750 %. No persons slugging percentage can ever be below .250. take care|`|Tew81Iavaa	Whereas a players batting average tells us how many hits a player gets per at bat (a batting average of .300 means 3 hits per 10 ab), a players slugging percentage tells us how many bases he gets per AB. <br>  Slugging percentage is determined by taking Total bases (Hits + 2b + 2*3b  + 3*HR) / At Bats.<br>  Slugging percentage gives us a good idea of a players power hitting. For example, two players can have a batting average of .300. One, however, could be a big homerun hitter and have a slugging percentage of .600, and an other could be a singles hitter and have a slugging percentage of .350. <br>  While both hitters have the same batting average, the homerun hitter is more likely to get an extra base hit, as shown by his slugging percentage.

Xh4Evef0aa	i think the players would be too buggered to play another lot of games at the end of the season. you'd see too many players getting injured because of the long season that we have.<br>  and anyway, by the time the season is done im pretty over watching footy. but im pretty pumped for the start of the season i must say.<br>  up the chookies!!|`|f9hiPMDxaa	During the Super League war they tried it but it was very costly and the rattings weren't great, but a lot of ARL supporters wouldn't have followed it.|`|OYy82bAYaa	Thats a great idea.... But who would host it?.... Oooo and when will it be played... <br>  <br>  i like the idea but I'm not to keen on seeing an extenion of the season....|`|CZvrFqZ1aa	I'm pretty sure they had that in the Super League when the war was happening between the SL and ARL.<br>  It would be a pretty good idea I reckon, whether it is after the GF or during the season. But it takes around 36 hours to get from Aus to Eng so that's around 2-3 days in travel, and midweek that might not be the best idea.<br>  I wouldn't mind the idea, the best time I reckon would be after the season so both codes would be fresh still.|`|mber3JoAaa	There is no room for that concept in the rugby league calendar, it's full enough. Overload the calendar, and people will tire of the game, like they are with rugby union.|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	Good idea if they could fit it in but it is not viable at the moment so just sticking to the Leeds Manly game will suffice. Can't get enough league though!
0CmsF1TXaa	Totally agree with you, the AFL will never become a true international game if they keep changing the rules. How will players overseas learning the game pick it up if the current players in Australia don't even know the rules. The interchange rule is by far one of the worst rules, it is so confusing for the players.<br>  <br>  Hands in the back and deliberate out of bounds are only making it harder for umpires and increasing everyone's hate for them.<br>  <br>  The rule in the NAB for the rushed behind will also make the game more complicated and confusing for players and fans.<br>  <br>  If the AFL stop changing the rules the game will be better for it.|`|IPcyQcLbaa	Haha. Yess some rules are good + But i think if the rules go our way and are played fairly then it doesnt matter. Hands in the back is soft. and i think unless the player actually pushes the other over then it shouldnt be free, because then they should just have no contact, which would be even crapper.  but yes<br>  <br>  GO COLLINGWOOD  :)|`|JEMtVVkBaa	wow, deliberate OOB has been in for quite a number of years now!!<br>  <br>  but Hands in the Back and the Interchange Rule can be very messy and confusing.<br>  <br>  The old system used to be is that if there were too many players on the ground, the captain of the other team would have to call a 'count'. The umpire would stop play, bring everyone to the middle that was on the field at that time and count the players from both teams.<br>  <br>  if there were too many players on the field, then that teams score would be wipped off the board. If there were the correct amount of players on, the captain would be reported for time wasting.<br>  <br>  I like the deliberate out of bounds rule. It keeps the ball moving so players dont just go for touch. The game would be much more stale without it.|`|2s244jGgaa	I have one thing to say to the people that invent the rules for afl...<br>  <br>  LEAVE OUR GAME ALONE & STOP CHANGING THE RULES. <br>  <br>  well said in my opinion.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Couldn't agree more - is Aussie Rules a game for men or schoolgirls? Hands in the back is a weak rule, only a real push should be judged for a free. There'll just be so many frees this season, it will slow the game down too much, make the flow very disjointed and take away a lot from the physical side of the game.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	They should just say 'right, no rule changes for 10 years'  the game will still survive, the way they are going people will give up on the game, it's getting like basketball but on a bigger playing arena.|`|W8SgRKo7aa	the behind rule is good but the rest is stupid|`|YcvKwRqiaa	Tell us something we don't know.

Tradition is what players are encouraged to recognise and they keep the tradition alive week after week by wearing the guernsey that represents the team, its history and values.|`|W8SgRKo7aa	It worked it looked pretty good to. <br>  Collingwood look lean this year! its looking good. still chance of beating the hawks or cats is slim those two teams are ruining our game!|`|4wRyTY9Raa	white and black as opposed to black and white, made sense with all the black on the tigers jumpers.|`|xmg9CBnCaa	they were wearing an alternate jumper? i couldn't tell
LUnscegvaa	Japanese ju-jitsu.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest<br>  <br>  As it's an all rounder and covers all areas of fighting.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|gBO908P6aa	It's not a style but a training philosophy.  If you enroll yourself in Jeet Kune Do, you will learn striking, joint locking, grappling, weapons, etc by studying a variety of styles such as Muay Thai, Karate, Savate, Brazilian/Traditional Jiujitsu, wrestling, boxing, Filipino Kali/Arnis/Escrima, Pentjak Silat, etc.|`|lpU2dnqsaa	There's many that fit that criteria:<br>  <br>  Hapkido was a good suggestion. It's strikes, throws, joint locks/joint manipulation, throws/standing grappling, and in some cases ground grappling.<br>  <br>  Kajukenbo is similar, but with much different arts combined.<br>  <br>  Traditional Japanese jujutsu or Aikijujutsu would be up your alley as well.<br>  <br>  Most hybird arts really will cover your criteria. Just look around. Good luck.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	Many styles will prepare you in this way when they are taught well. Look around at what is available in your area and see which schools are taught the best and include everything you are looking for. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't have any trouble finding schools in your area through Google, your phone book or even a drive around. Give the schools a call or walk right in and arrange some trial classes. If they don't allow a trial class be weary but don't rule it out because they may just have an insurance issue they don't want to risk.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Sounds like you want Japanese Jujitsu or Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu.|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	Yes, Kajukenbo--look it up-they teach it here in the US|`|AA10698309	Take a serious look at Hapkido. This art incorporates many of the strikes of Taekwondo with a very strong focus on joint locks, grappling, throws, etc. It is probably the best art to learn for self defense. <br>  I am a first degree black belt in TKD and enjoy this style for the flexibilty and cardio and as well as the strikes - but TKD is probably not as effective as Hapkido in "real world situations". Check out some YouTube videos on Hapkido.|`|QfvmFbVSaa	Yes you just described the ats of Korean Hapkido / japanese aikido they both focus on short strikes kicks and alot of joint locks and take downs for defence and are used in training military and police officers.|`|salB3tiSaa	If you're looking for straight up effectiveness, I'd recommend looking at wing chun. It's a very no frills, straight forward (literally), easy to learn style.|`|KUUfGugFaa	Strikes, kicks,joint locks, grappling and wrestling sounds a lot like MMA
hyLnJibTaa	I would try your local YMCA. They have lifeguarding classes sometimes.

Good luck! Being a lifeguard is the best job in the world! :)
LUnscegvaa	I have experienced the delusion of giving up martial arts because I made the wrong choices when younger,but, keep going as there is a style to suit everyone if you search long enough,and yes judo is excellent for many reasons so give it a go.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes :)***|`|r5AMG8g7aa	Katana172 gave you a good answer. Don't stop looking.  They are out there. Granted there are fewer and few, but they are out there. As for your age. You have no problem there. I have started new students in their 50's many times. I myself have trained over 41 years. I'm nearly 55 now and still training. Just train!<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	I started at 20 and am now 68 and still teaching .I have had students as old as I am now start .I modified some movements for them but their requirements are no less strict than any one else's.<br>  Bad dojo can sour your whole view of martial arts and you think they are all the same and it's an attitude I have run into when prospective students come around asking questions.I will give them a months free work out to make up their own mind if they are really skeptical .Any good instructor should be willing to give you at least a few free lessons and allow you to talk freely with other students and what they think of it.|`|QM2A6rBlaa	Nope never too late. I started when I was 21. My instructors Sensei started when he was in his early 40's. We have students who just started who have kids in high school.<br>  <br>  It really sucks that you have had bad experiences with schools, unfortunatly TKD and ninjitsu are noted for having McDojo's, as is karate. Unfortunatly sometimes, especially in America, the desire for money over rides everything else. I could not live with myself if I sent a student out, thinking they could defend themselves, and whebn they really needed it they couldn't.<br>  <br>  Their are good schools out their in every style, it is up to you to do your research though. I have seen awsome TKD schools, and many exceptional karate schools. I would try and stick with actual styles of karate from Okinawa and Japan, although there are a few American styles that I would recomend, such as Ed Parkers Kempo or Kujinkenbo, if you can find a good school. Too many unqualified people have developed a style and franchised it to make money, which in turn is one of the reasons why TKD and karate, and Kung Fu have gotten such a bad reputation.<br>  <br>  Just do a search on here about what to look for in a good school, and go by one of the answers from one of these top contributers:<br>  <br>  Pugpaws<br>  Shihan J<br>  James 24F<br>  Clowns<br>  Judomofo<br>  Big Dog<br>  <br>  There are some others that give good answers, however I know that these people do consistently.<br>  <br>  If it is Judo you are interested in then I would e-mail judomofo as he has extensive experience in Judo, and may even be able to tell you about the program you are interetested in.<br>  <br>  Either that or e-mail me and I will get you a list of what to look for.|`|Yslq4OYhaa	Unfortunately there are bad schools out there from all styles of martial arts.<br>  <br>  But there are many good schools. I would suggest that you do some research before joining a school. Look at a variety of schools. If they have free trial periods take it. I personally know of a few good school at the YMCA. Like one poster said they do not do it for the money. The YMCA have been asking me to teach Karate. I haven't accepted because of the bad experience the previous teacher had with them. I do not believe every YMCA will have a like experience, but this particular one gave him so much grief I stayed away. I was told they attempted to let the parents run his classes. That was too much power for people that don't know martial arts.<br>  <br>  You can also find some good schools in Recreation Centers and in some not as well known churches.<br>  <br>  Avoid long term contracts, school with small children with black belts, and schools that guarantee you a black belt.|`|pLsQdLl3aa	I want to add to what katana said and maybe raise your spirits a bit. Life is a funny thing sometimes. It has a way of teaching you things the hard way. You went through all that with past garbage MA schools and now you know what to look for in a school. Logic would state that anyone teaching at the YMCA is not doing it for the money and there for for the love of teaching the art. Some of the best teachers teach for the love of the art. I've heard a lot of those contributors he mentioned say very similar things in the past.<br>  <br>  Go in there, watch how the students interact with each other, and the teacher. Is it with respect? Watch to see if everyone is focused on the teacher when he is talking or are they bull$hitting with each other. Take a look at the technique the upper belts are performing with. Is it crisp? Done without stopping to think about it, or wobbling around like a baby deer? Is it what you are aiming to look like in a few years?<br>  <br>  Don't give up man, life kicks us all around for a reason. The successful ones learn from their beatings. Get back to us with how it goes.  Good luck

5V8ugidKaa	No Stanford already tore there defense a part, so it's to late for that|`|90515b7dacf98f7e66f91ea1e82dd6e0aa	dennis dixon will have a great day against usc but he will not be able to have his way with their defense.  he'll have to mix up the plays and run himself more in this game but oregon will prevail 45-35|`|AA10316680	He won't be tearing them up like he did against Michigan. Dixon is really good and the only way they will beat USC is if they score 45.|`|Djo00RZGaa	I say no.  The USC defense is crazy fast and is getting players healthy.  I will say the his performance against Michigan was epic, though.|`|GBSblk2Gaa	(No Message)|`|IoXH9RA7aa	No.|`|js9YbCOuaa	For one thing USC had key defensive players hurt at that time, whom they have had back since the the plastering of the Irish. Also Booty was playing with a f*cked up finger.  So what happens when you get your key defensive players back from injury and a real good backup if not one of the best back up Q.B.'s in the country playing.  You *** whip the other team !! so your answer is no, Dixon will not tear them up.  Just hope that the Ducks can match touchdown for touchdown, because if they don't ....well I can tell you this the Ducks will be in for a very long day i f they can't and that is just plain fact !!!|`|ugF5sze3aa	i hope, then hell get more heisman hype|`|k2Eso8XDaa	No and heres the reason why:<br>  <br>  1. Dennis Dixon is mediocre at best when hes forced to stay inside the pocket. <br>  <br>  2. USC defense is in the top 10 of nearly every defensive category.<br>  <br>  3. Oregons defense is highly suspect<br>  <br>  <br>  USC has all the tools to knock out the Ducks. Sure Dennis Dixon is great out in space and outside the pocket, and Oregon's spread offense is hard to contain. But if you have fast and disciplined defenders, this offense can be shut down. What does USC have on defense? Speed, Speed, and more Speed. Oh and by the way, their very disciplined. Sedrick Ellis and Lawrence Jackson will get pressure on the Outside edge and inside the pocket, forcing Dixon to go to either his left where he struggles, or eat the play. Then he has to pick his poison because does he try to force the ball, or does he take his chances against a spy that Pete Carroll will place on him. Whether it's Keith Rivers, Ray Malaluga etc.. someone will have their eyes in Dixon at all times minimizing his play. <br>  <br>  USC 34 Oregon 21|`|W2ibvX9taa	no. <br>  <br>  Dont know if you realize this but Michigan's defense sucks.

Houston is just a better team <br>  Dallas beats down Philly, Romo proves that he is worth the extension<br>  Pittsburgh beats Ravens, because the Ravens have been playing horrible Offense all year, and the Steelers Offense is to good not to get over 14 points.|`|1vMEp6noaa	Sorry Marc, the only thing I know about football, is that they throw 25 cents to start the game.

f3d417cdfb9f604c48d5402fdaa23553aa	I am most interested in seeing how Farve can do against the Denver Secondary.  So far, nobody has really been forced to test them for an entire game.  I think Green Bay will have to tonight since they have virtually no running game.  We'll find out whether Bailey and Bly are as good a tandem as all of us Denver fans think they are.|`|Djo00RZGaa	The Packers have 2 good corners, and a safety that is rapidly coming into his own as a football player.  After that, the depth is weak in the secondary.  Cutler should have moderate success if he throws to his 3rd WR or his TE when he's in trouble.  The Denver D has always been good, and Favre can give the ball away when he's under pressure.|`|nYLSSik1aa	I expect denver to win,i think green bay is overrated,27-9 denver

7xTW5DpVaa	Try throwing a tennis ball against a wall, or having someone throw one to you and catching with only your finger tips. There are lots of ways to improve your hands, but that is a solid one.|`|6wK8XcFhaa	make sure you make a diamond with your thumbs and index fingers,  that way when you catch the ball, the nose of the football will enter that opening forcing your hands around the ball . I had the same problem when I was a tight end, and figuring out that fundamental increased my receptions by about 75% <br>  <br>  Gloves will help as well, but I would honestly try and learn to catch with bare hands before I introduced any other means.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|sr96hogwaa	When you catch the ball look it all the way in, and dont look upfield until you have caught the ball. Also try making a diamond type of thing out of your hands, index finger against index finger, thumb against thumb. Try not to cradle the ball, usually it just bounces off of your shoulder pads and onto the ground, use our hands.|`|vhCHSYKSaa	gloves will help, but they dont fix the problem. just practice catching a ton at home and when catching hold hands an inch or two away from eachother with all fingers extended. when you catch it kind of give the ball some give and let it flex your hands back. it will come with time|`|x8Eh2VwJaa	You can always try returning kicks for now, but I think your attitude towards the position is good.  It helps to stay optimistic and focused.<br>  <br>  I think you have to first know your plays and the guys that are going to be throwing you the ball.  Every QB delivers the ball differently and can help or hinder the ability for his receivers to catch the ball.  If you know where the ball is going and how it's getting there, it will help you be able to catch the ball.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, your offseason goals should be to maintain your speed and agility, build your strength, and increase your coordination.  Stay active by going to the gym, running, and lifting weights.  Also, and I mean this seriously, play some basketball, even outdoors if you can.  You should be able to maintain, if not, increase your mobility and help your competitive spirit.<br>  <br>  I heard of people saying that you should try and catch tennis balls and toss around bricks with your friends, but that only helps so much.  If you're not familiar with your playbook and teammates, and can't keep cool during a highly competitive football game, you're not going to catch anything.<br>  <br>  Make sure to buy yourself some gloves before next season and study hard.  You should find yourself doing well next year.

UZ39hyuxaa	The batting motion doesn't seem to affect game play (though the pitching motions do affect the meter), so this is simply a cosmetic change.<br>  <br>  Walk-up music also doesn't matter, and as far as position/hitting style, that depends what kind of player you're trying to be.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to simply mash the ball, you'd be best taking an easier position, like 1B or LF, where you won't need to boost all of your fielding stats, and focus on hitting.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to play a fast player, you may want to take a position where it'll matter, like SS-2B-CF.<br>  <br>  What you need to remember is that all skills increase seperately, even though they should be tied. You can bench press to get your power to the .500 Slg levels, it won't help your throwing arm unless you invest in that as well.<br>  <br>  And good luck.|`|GmAi1JAsaa	i always liked jeters <br>  his is really classic<br>  also try a-rods his is cool<br>  im not a yankees fan im an astros i just like their batting stances|`|WbaZOG05aa	ALBERT PUJOLS BABY!

pF0fTHpiaa	Depends on what you're trying to achieve...<br>  <br>  I would try to do about three shakes a day of whey protein with glutamine peptides if you're trying to replace carbs (from running) and need to repair your muscles with amino acids.<br>  <br>  You can get protein powder from any vitamin/health supplement store. I like "Whey Gold" by Optimum Health in Cookies & Cream flavor. (I'm not sure if that one has glutamine peptides though.)|`|1VkM4iGmaa	Glutamine is an amino acid, taking glutamine will not give u a carb intake it will give you more protein. Glutamine is good for helping repair muscles b/c it is the must abundant amino acid in muscle cells.<br>  I use optimum nutrition 100% whey gold standard after my workout. I would use a meal replacement shake with casein protein for your other shakes. Casein is milk protein and it digests slower...almost like a time release protein. Whey digests fast which is good post workout so you can get as much protein as possible as quickly as possible post-workout.<br>  Some good meal replacements i think (i havent taken them in a long time) are one made by pro-lab (n-large i think) or the one made by optimum nutrition. Whatever meal replacement you get make sure the main protein is casein (it will be listed before any other proteins in the ingredient list), it is low in fats and low in sugars. You can find meal replacements which are low in sugars...you have to be persistent.<br>  <br>  I always get my stuff at www.massnutrition.com cheapest site i've found by far...cheaper than bodybuilding.com<br>  <br>  i would recommend 1 -1.5 g of protein per pound body weight per day. I would take 30-40 g of a whey protein post workout. i would take the meal replacement shake between breakfast and lunch. Don't rely on shakes for your protein intake, they are a supplement, get the majority of your protein from lean meats like chicken, turkey and lean cuts of beef. Make sure to take a multivitamin as well.
jZKEZNE6aa	honestly, and I hate to say it but you really have to pay your dues to the pain gods to get a reward in track and there's no really good way around it, especially as you get into the higher levels, what i mean by this is that you just have to put in massive amounts of hard work but DONT OVERTRAIN. outwork your friend every single day and it wont happen overnight but at the end of the season you'll be the faster one|`|0cCBoYIoaa	as you run take steady deep breaths and do not start out fast, take a steady pace (unless sprinting, when sprinting go full out full time) or else you will tire quickly|`|HcTzo2W5aa	breath out of ur nose when u run, the air is more direct.|`|VtMlDUpbaa	Theirs an old coaching book with tips... Bud Winters wrote it.  He coached an Olympic Track team and destroyed everyone... if you can find it.  So much in it to describe here... stay on your toes, lift your knees, lean a bit forward, hands near waist lower than distance running... find a steep hill 50m - 100m and run up it 6 - 8 times twice a week to build your legs and endurance...  strecth well before and after.  walk in a pool.  a little thing i did was secretely eat some chochlate right before a race for the sugar rush.|`|iZLWPPjgaa	you really just have to practice harder to get better cause it won't happen overnight... but a few tips are... <br>  if it's distance running make sure to pace yourself and breath.

Its doubtfull that he would be replaced by anyone one else considering that this year's Survivor's Series is based on personal rivalries.

VccRxEF8aa	Tu regardes trop de NBA non? C'est pas vraiment ce que j'appelle du basket ?a...<br>  <br>  ce soir lors du match Real Madrid- Roanne:<br>  Madrid 104 points dont 6 points par des dunks (5,7%)<br>  Roanne 73 points dont 10 par dunk (13%)<br>  <br>  et encore c'était beaucoup. Une grande équipe ne doit pas prendre plus de 2 dunks par match sinon ?a veut tout simplement dire que les systèmes défensifs (et les changements de défenseurs après les screens des attaquants) ne sont pas au point. <br>  <br>  Pour les 3 points: entre 0% et 50%, mais en général ca se situe aux alentours de 10-12% (entre 7-9 trois points pour un match finissant vers les 80 points<br>  <br>  Mais au basket la chose la plus dure, et la plus importante c'est la passe: lors du shoot tu as un défenseur et un objectif qui ne bouge pas. La passe tu a 2 défenseurs ou plus (le tiens et celui de ton coéquipier), tu cherches a atteindre un objectif qui bouge, très souvent toi aussi tu bouges, et il y a aussi des passes qui ne peuvent être effectues que pendant 1/10 de secondes sinon elles sont interceptées). C'est la ou tu peux voir si un joueur est bon...|`|6659789118333b304f9c9feeec245b29aa	Non, le dunk n'est pas si utilise que ca. Tout depend d'abord du championnat. <br>  Dans les championnats europeens, il est peu courant de mettre des dunks. Les defenses sont serrees et il est difficile de penetrer pour atteindre l'arceau, donc il est surtout utilise en contre-attaque. <br>  En NBA, il est plus utilise (on est plus dans l'attaque et le spectacle, meme si c'est de moins en moins le cas), mais la encore la majorite des points est marquee en shoot classique. Les interieurs sont grands et il n'est pas evident non plus de scorer un dunk. Je ne saurais donner un pourcentage, mais je dirais qu'en nba, 20% des points sont dunkés. <br>  Pour les 3 points, ca depend si vous avez des bons shooteurs dans l'equipe et donc les chiffres sont tres variables. En allant voir sur Internet, je remarque que les meilleurs tireurs a 3 points ont marques entre 20 et 30 paniers a 3 points en une quinzaine de matches, ce qui fait 2 a 3 paniers de ce type par match. Il me semble que Ray Allen a deja reussi a plante 8 ou 9 "3 points" dans un match et c'est tres fort.<br>  <br>  Amicalement.|`|fa5a4669490fdc047835e196cc82aefdaa	vine... a bien répondu...

Aunque se puede hacer por distintas vías, la más utilizada entre el público en general es la basada en el correo electrónico. Otras tecnologías de internet que han sido objeto de correo basura incluyen grupos de noticias usenet, motores de búsqueda, wikis, foros, blogs, también a través de popups y todo tipo de imagenes y textos en la web.

Desde ese entonces, el marketing mediante correo electrónico ha crecido a niveles impensados desde su creación.<br>  El correo basura por medio del fax (spam-fax), es otra de las categorías de esta técnica de marketing directo, y consiste en enviar faxes masivos y no solicitados a través de sistemas electrónicos automatizados hacia miles de personas o empresas cuya información ha sido cargada en bases de datos segmentadas según diferentes variables.<br>  En Espa?a el correo electrónico no solicitado está terminantemente prohibido por la Ley de Servicios de la Sociedad de la Información y de Comercio Electrónico (LSSICE), publicada en el BOE del 12 de julio de 2002.

27fd034847d3d27fde933f822451de7baa	one important tip for deep water start: if you are left foot forward put your ski on the left side of the rope. and right side for right foot forward. tuck the ski way underneath you, by bring your knees up to your chest, so that you can feel the ski on your rear. the ski tip should stick out of the water but you want the ski to be sitting almost parallel with the waters surface. when the boat goes keep contact with the ski and your rear then as you go faster do a "crunch " of sorts.  don't hurry to stand up and don't pull back on the rope. let the boat do the work.(don't have a timid driver..don't go too slow but alternately, you don't want to yank your shoulders out of their sockets!)|`|YAp772wTaa	I just started doing watersports about 3 years ago.  I can double ski, trick ski, wake board, and wake surf...<br>  <br>  Slaloming or even just dropping a ski are still impossible for me.  I spend a couple runs trying to slalom almost every time I go and I can't seem to figure it out.  I just get frustrated and a lot of water up my nose.  But my whole family can slalom like they were born doing it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dTPvYg7raa	I've been skiing now for about 25yrs and the slalom is my game.  While dropping is an effective way to learn, I don't agree with it being the best.  I have lost several skis from others trying to drop one.   Plus there is always the balance thing of transferring over to the other ski (most people fall.....a lot).  O'Brien makes a video (I'm not a big fan of O'Brien skis...I use a 2005-6 KD Titanium CR-7) but their video is very informative on all the major/popular water sports.  Best thing to do is have an experienced boat driver/skier with you to analyze your form and watch how you ready yourself in the water.  Remember: arms straight, sit in the chair, don't fight the boat, back straight, yell "Hit-it", and hang on.  It really is one of those things like riding a bike.  Once you come up the first time, you'll know what it feels like to clear the hole and be able to duplicate.  Once that happens, watch out.  In comparison, two skis are like your grandma's Cadillac on a sunday drive.  A slalom is like a Ferrari at the track, much more responsive to turning and picking up speed.  Good luck!|`|TwVsZGiqaa	Hi there! My best guess is you haven't really figure out which one is your front foot... (I might be wrong)??<br>  <br>  This method might be a bit slow, but after a few practice you'll have a stronger and confident ride... <br>  <br>  Try this... start off by using 2 skis (double ski), cut out of the right wake and lift your LEFT LEG... balance, then do it on the left wake, lift RIGHT LEG. Feel the difference, and the best feel/balance is the front foot. <br>  <br>  Adjust your bindings accordingly... loosen the side you're going to 'drop'. Make sure it's safe to drop your ski... alert your boat driver and anyone else in the area.<br>  <br>  It is the best way to start slalom ski, and getting the fundamentals right will avoid any bad habits (and frustrations) in the future.<br>  <br>  If you have a barefoot bar / boom from the boat... try using this method last. Your initial run... use the bar (practice your body position), move on using a short rope (you can use a w/board handle, loop it around the bar)...<br>  <br>  Again, safety first... you'll be skiing near to the boat, so gotta make sure your driver knows how to do it.|`|xmEUoX8Iaa	ive been water skiing since i was 8 and im only 16. and what  you should try first is to drop a ski. first when you put your skis on put the one you're going to drop on as loose as you can, then shift all you weight on to the ski that you're not going to drop the lift the other ski up and try to kick it off but keep your balance. then stick the open foot in the back pocket. make sure you keep the majority of your weight on the back foot and use the front foot for direction.<br>  <br>  to get up on one you can either start with your foot in the pocket or out of it what ever you feel more comfortable then when you want to stand up later then you would on two skis and when the boat starts to pull you forward keep keep your shoulders back and keep your knees bent until you feel completely balanced then stand up, and have fun!!<br>  <br>  p.s. to find out what foot you use in front have a friend stand behind you and push you a little bit forward and what ever foot you step with to catch your balance is the foot you probably feel most comfortable in the front|`|XWoWLKpoaa	Just recently this summer I learned to slalom for the first time. I found it was harder to 'drop' a ski than to get up on only one. Just make sure you stay down as long as you can. If you try to pull yourself up you will fall every time.  You will be able to tell when your out of the water.

NWkvYYq7aa	Trading J.B.L and Cena for Triple H would be a great decision by the wwe.<br>  <br>  Cena needs to win his fans back and he can start from doing it in Smackdown. Smackdown dosent go live so they can change a couple of his moves and stuff like that.  he could win over his "haters".<br>  <br>  Moving J.B.L would be a another great move. Smackdown is needs a big heel and here is J.B.L. He could start by fueding Cena. He isint doing nothing on RAW. Smackdown is his door open for sucess.<br>  <br>  <br>  Triple H has his fans in RAW and smackdown. He fits in both ways. Triple H dosent really have tough cometators in Smackdown so moving him to RAW would be no problem. His popularity would increase a little bit. It would benefit to the company. HHH dosent do enough on Smackmdown. He needs a challenge.|`|NzrJeHTMaa	Maybe for JBL and someone else but not Cena.|`|UGKcFIc8aa	i would not trade teddy long for cena. that guy is worthless|`|2Ms54b2Laa	hell no!!!

DjifToZgaa	I was surprised to see how footballguys.com ranked them for this week:<br>  <br>  -#10 Rosenfels<br>  -#27 Collins<br>  <br>  I think the Collins ranking is low, but it is somewhat a reflection of the run-heavy Titans attack, and that his top wideouts are no better than a #3 on most other teams.  He has been a game manager.  He has what, 3 TD passes and hasn't topped 200 yards all season.<br>  <br>  I never like putting a QB against the Baltimore defense, and Rosenfels is the ultimate Jekyl-Hyde, but he is capable of prolific games.  I think he will have to pass for the Texans to win.  I like Daniels/Walter/Johnson and Kubiak has been in this exact situation last year about this time.<br>  <br>  I would play Rosenfels, just don't expect much.|`|YAp772wTaa	Collins.  No question.  He will put of respectable numbers.  Nothing to write home about, but points none the less...<br>  <br>  Did you see Sage's last game?  I would me more worried about the fumbles and interceptions, than him tossing two scores...I think he is'nt going to play the same after that Confidence shaker he had with Indy. 
sSvBTYG0aa	Jeff''s current contract allows him to earn just at $150,000 per year ...<br>  <br>  He would be making more ; BUT his pay was cut BOTH times he failed the WWE Wellness Test ..... it is part of the contract to happen .|`|EnIHwlT1aa	right around 500,000 a year<br>  <br>  maybe a lil bit less bt right around that much|`|1abb6467b90ad250fdace112dd3429dfaa	$3 a second|`|UDqMdvESaa	More then me :(|`|SrJoXBrZaa	depends on if he attends PPV's. the 3 he missed due to his suspension would have been worth about $150,000 so just think on a lower scale cuz its the lesser important PPV's right now |`|ROyxH5Whaa	some where in the range of more than $0 and less than $999999999999999999999999999999999999999...<br>  <br>  |`|UGKcFIc8aa	way to much for his unreliability.|`|4tTFgqiraa	Your dad|`|dGaboQihaa	a lot|`|ho39lQUjaa	more than you do|`|QJwaagGWaa	More than your  broke as$|`|e3m3rdNYaa	i know Matt makes $300,000 so i think its pretty close to that
tz7JEqstaa	I'm totally against violence and Inzamam comes across as being a very placid sort of guy. Guess there is a limit to the amount of abuse one can absorb before spitting the dummy.

YAp772wTaa	I'd stick with Stewart @ Oakland. I'm an Oakland fan and I know how bad we are this years.  Plus with the release of DeAngello Hall, I don;t think many players will be giving it their all this week.|`|9xZFlH45aa	Gore without a doubt.  Then go with Rice.  Baltimore is a ball control offense and will run all over Houston.  Minnesota is a bad matchup for RB's.  Stewart might do OK, but I think he'll give up too much to Williams.  Denver can't run the ball, period.  And Green-Ellis is definitely a longshot, particularly against the stout Bills.|`|6W7Yshm4aa	keep gore in there.and the other one i would pick is ray rice.look for him 2 have a career game against the terrible texans run defense|`|urpVWXftaa	go with torain trust me on this... denver always forks up star running backs.

d0d33523d2f9652d0c41be54c44963acaa	Libra i'm gonna have to disagree with you again.  Booker T (the character) died when he took up that godawful persona of King Booker.  The REAL Booker T fans are the ones that remember him back when he did the spinarooney and didn't rely on outside help to win a match.  The REAL Booker T fans remember booker as the, and I quote, five time... five time... five time... five time... five time WcW Champion.  King Booker is just a really annoying heel gimmick and Booker T needs to lose his title/Kingship to become the real Booker T once again.  Besides, I miss the spinarooney too.|`|0e562704361e9adb696922305856aa02aa	i miss BOOKER T THE 5X...5X CHAMPION!

b7JS16dyaa	You'll have to be strong and have a partner who won't botch. You might as well not be trying lifting/aerial moves if you're an amateur, you'll probably screw up. Strikes and submissions can be played around with as long as you don't do it to hard, along with simple moves like a DDT or Pedigree. If you really want to do things like suplexes, try in on mattresses, trampolines, pools, etc. Just don't do piledrivers. >_><br>  <br>  Best thing to do is not bother at all.

YAp772wTaa	That's tough, but if you are willing to take a gamble I would start Winslow and Edwards.  Quinn is getting his first start, but this is his 3rd year in the offense and Denver's D couldn't stop a college team.<br>  <br>  Cleveland will pound Jamal Lewis on the ground and open up the short.intermediate play action routes, which are what Quinn does a LOT better than anderson.  I predict this could be Winslow's biggest game of the season.<br>  <br>  Don't forget Devner is without Champ Bailet, Marlon McRee, Boss Bailey, AND DJ Williams.  Should be like shooting fish in a barrel.|`|9xZFlH45aa	Gotta start Gonzo...how did your league let you end up with Winslow AND Gonzalez?  SD's pass defense is weak, and the Chief's don't have much else.<br>  Go with Edwards vs. Denver, as Bailey is pretty banged up.  Without Bailey or with a gimpy Bailey, they are not good.<br>  I think Quinn will be fine.  Maybe he'll actually hit some receivers, something Anderson has not been doing this year.  Of course Braylon's 14 drops doesn't help matters.

ebf61605dfebfb9e227088a03fae5b6eaa	The good old Montreal Screwjob, details as follows:<br>  <br>  The Montreal Screwjob (a.k.a. the Montreal Incident, Montreal Finish, Survivor Series Screwjob, or The Double Cross) is professional wrestling parlance for a genuine incident that took place on November 9, 1997 during a match for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) Championship between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels at Survivor Series. The incident featured WWF Chairman Vince McMahon instructing referee Earl Hebner to prematurely end the match, legitimately cheating Hart out of the WWF Championship he held. The incident was featured in the 1998 movie Wrestling with Shadows, a documentary about Hart's life as a WWF wrestler. It was also featured in the McMahon DVD.<br>  <br>  McMahon tentatively agreed to end the match in Montreal with a planned disqualification finish, which would involve various cohorts of both Hart and Michaels running in and disrupting the match. Hart said that he could make a live speech the next day on the November 10, 1997 edition of RAW and then hand the belt back or that he could lose the title to Ken Shamrock who had, in the weeks leading to Survivor Series, made both Hart and Michaels tap out to his Ankle Lock finisher.<br>  <br>  After an arena-wide brawl before the match had even officially started, Hart allowed Michaels to place him in the Sharpshooter after accidentally knocking Hebner out, as per the planned finish. Michaels then gave Hart his foot to reverse the hold. Hebner, having come back up to his feet, then signalled to the timekeeper to ring the bell and end the match as if Hart had submitted to the hold; McMahon, seated at ringside, elbowed the timekeeper and screamed at him to "Ring the ******* bell!" Hebner then bolted backstage from the ring and left the Molson Centre in a waiting car. Just as Hart broke the hold and Michaels fell to the mat, the latter was quickly awarded the match and the title as his theme music began to play. All the while, Hart remained in the ring in shock.<br>  <br>  Astounded by the unexpected turn of events, Hart was immediately outraged. Michaels showed no celebration whatsoever over the victory and even gave an expression of apparent anger and frustration. As Hart stood dazed in the ring, Triple H and Gerald Brisco came out to escort Michaels backstage as the fans threw garbage at him and relentlessly and loudly booed at him; one fan even went so far as to shove Michaels as he was passing him. Hart looked down at McMahon from the ring, spat right in his eye and, shortly after announcers Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler departed their position, Hart then destroyed several TV monitors at ringside before climbing the turnbuckles and signing the letters "wCw" in the air to the rabid crowd. Bret's younger brother Owen Hart and his brothers-in-law Jim Neidhart and Davey Boy Smith came down to the ring to try and calm him down.<br>  <br>  To the last guy, did you even read the question? We all knew he was leaving, he asked why there was a problem between the two. Vince asked Bret to leave, not Bret wanted to leave. Bret had a 20 year contract with WWF (at the time). So he never would have been able to leave had Vince not given the go ahead.|`|AA12302661	Check out the dude with the essay. HBK is and was very sexy. Bret Hart only was sexy.|`|f3586d5e0985f6e9f0447a70215d2b84aa	In Bret's hometown Shawn put Bret in the sharpshooter. and the ref rang the bell even though Bret never gave up.|`|8e89508eaa24814a96b82f6527864e6eaa	Yeah, what he said|`|AA10202315	WRONG! Bret was ALREADY on his way out of WWF , because he had accepted a contract with WCW for a lot of money. True, the "screw job" did happen and it tarnished Bret's career with WWF but he was already going to leave. It should not have happened that way but Vince was doing what he thought he had to do to protect his product. Many , many wrestlers had left with belt only to show up on the competition's show with the belt..trying to hurt them. I am SURE that the scum bucket that bischoff is ....he wanted Bret to bring the belt with him so he could trash it on WCW tv!!|`|a78ce9640ccadd4f7dafdcd579874cf6aa	my friend ,you heard correction.
11i3Xmb1aa	I believe that TNA ratings will drop, because who would loose the opportunity to not watch one of WWE's Greatest PPV's on the Best Stage of Them All.

Their have been talks about this already.<br>  <br>  The WWE is launching a new network for their Friday program and this ,move is to kinda launch it but you have to wonder that no matter how well the WWE is doing and as far as ratings the numbers has been lowering each year that the WWE programming channels has changed a lot.  This is the 3rd network Friday programming has change to.<br>  <br>  But on a side note, was this a strategic move from Vince McMahon to launch another wrestling war to increase interest and ratings?  The WWF/WCW war did bring out a better product.|`|rrcnjnDWaa	I have never gotten to see it! I cant wait!!!!! I will probably start crying!!!<br>  TNA will loose at least half of its ratings that night!<br>  <br>  BUT I AM.......<br>  <br>  CRazi 4 HBK|`|HHpVBoTuaa	Vince McMahon is a "sports entertainment" Genius.

0QtGG47Iaa	He's thinking of switching to Mexican pro wrestling.  Also, he's really gotten slow (don't get me wrong, he's still my favorite) and as a high-flyer he's getting injured faster than others.  <br>  <br>  He can't wrestle forever, and it's good they're using Rey to get Evan Bourne over.|`|UGKcFIc8aa	because vince uses stars and throws them away. that has always been mcmahon's problem. he doens't treat his wrestlers with respect. that is the reason some have went to tna. its not that tna can pay more, because everyone knows they cant, but they treat their stars with respect. it would not suprise me to see rey jump to tna.|`|sulBKkwsaa	i think its cause rey is asking for too much money to wrestle<br>  |`|a4NnvNY3aa	Cuz he's getting old as hell.|`|11i3Xmb1aa	If you mean that because of Evan Bourne, the WWE just want to give Bourne a fan base.

2FKHNIB2aa	I think it would work well for the Legacy story if they had a legend on there side, who supported them, but i don't think it would work at all in Jericho's because it would only take the heat off of him and slap it onto the legend who joined him.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Those are good ideas, and I can actually see both the Million Dollar Man and Cowboy Bob siding with Legacy.  I'm not sure if The American Dream would, though, as I can't see him in another heel run.  Then again, that shock value might be what makes that idea so intriguing.<br>  <br>  As for Ric Flair possibly managing Jericho, I don't see that happening under any circumstances.  He certainly was an outstanding heel "in his day", and I have no doubt that he'd still be able to generate heel heat, but the fans in general have too much respect for Naitch.  If a legend is going to manage Jericho (and possibly help him win at WrestleMania 25), it should be somebody like Paul Orndorff.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	I been thinking that for awhile now, why not have Dibiase Sr or Cowboy Bob Orton manager the stable. Then it would really be a " Legacy" maybe even have Dibiase Sr bring back the Million Dollar Championship belt and put it on his son.<br>  <br>  As for Flair and Jericho that would be a interesting team together I would like to see it happen. Jericho has shown that he's one of the dirtest players in the game right now.|`|W8SgRKo7aa	It would be a shock but it would rock hard.|`|2KBN2lCUaa	nice thought|`|I8laNaM8aa	would never happen but i like what your saying about mixing it up. flair didn't get that name by coincidence|`|OP4oIaLBaa	<a href="http://spicyinfo.8bit.at" rel="nofollow">http://spicyinfo.8bit.at</a><br>  it<br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
MQmQTl0haa	Chi as a concept simply refers to the body's ability to self regulate its functions. It is also attempts to describe good/bad states in terms of behavior/diet/karma etc... In this respect, chi is a useful concept with merit (though not of the scientific kind). It is a useful abstraction, nothing more.|`|apr9gsgjaa	chi is the energy dont be ignorant its real chi is energy period. its not senses its not adrenaline it make shapen senses but thats not what it is|`|hlqj0pvxaa	There is too much mis-information here from people who know nothing about this subject. <br>  <br>  The term "qi" or "chi" means nothing more than "air". <br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with "harnessing adrenaline" or any other biochemical function of the body. <br>  <br>  The oxygen we live off of is absorbed into the body and through "qigong" the electrons in the atoms we are made from are accelerated and this creates a strong magnetic field within us. <br>  <br>  It is pure energy from within generated through the manifesting of our breath. <br>  <br>  We can use this energy to heal ourselves, others, or to enhance our art - but the ultimate goal of developing your "qi" is optimal health and ultimately - Longevity. <br>  <br>  It is a God given gift that many choose to remain ignorant about. <br>  <br>  It is the "Breath of Life".|`|v1mbL56caa	Chi or life energy is kind of a catch all term for many things to do with Martial Arts, physical training and mental ability. In one aspect it is about breathing which energizes the body and keeps adrenalin in balance during extreme stress. In another aspect it is about the sudden release of stress hormones that can give increased acuity of vision, improved hearing and burst of extraordinary strength. Yet another is about the flow of blood and synovial fluids in the body None of these aspects require any thing supernatural. All of these aspects have been well documented and have a scientific base in biology and physiology. <br>  As for the supernatural aspect of Chi I can only suggest that you go with whatever faith system you have. I can not deny the sometimes extra ordinary things I have experienced in my lifetime. I know there are also a lot of charlatans and pretenders out there giving Martial Arts a black eye. My rule of thumb in life is "If it seems to good to be true it probably isn't"|`|KUUfGugFaa	If what your saying is being comprehended by me correctly, i would say your theory of "mystical" Chi is actually just a description of the bodies energy and thus KJ.<br>  Chi is designed to make you focus and thus fight better it is not something to harness it is something to believe in to take your mind off other things thus increasing your bodies efficiency and effectiveness.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	You can easily experience it this way... try to open a super tight can, where do you use??? That is CHI.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	I agree with much that you say here and will add an example that I use with my students.  If a person picked up a rock and threw it at a small target fifty feet away and hit it then that would be a pretty good shot.  Some or many might even call it a lucky shot.  That same person could probably pick up twenty or thirty more rocks and not repeat that or hit it again with maybe only one or two rocks.  Suppose instead if a person could, with each rock, hit the target or with the majority of them.  I think we would all agree that is a tremendous example of their body, muscles, and senses, (in this case their aim and eye sight) all working together at a very high level.  Their entire body, including their senses, operating in unison and with harmony to accomplish something.  If a martial artist could develop his skills and ability to that level with regards to his techniques and the execution of them then that would be a very high level of skill.  Being able to do that on demand all the time or most of the time to me is also the meaning of Ki or Chi-just like picking up that rock and hitting the target with that first throw.|`|A0HYQX5Baa	Umm..  sounds more like common sense to me.|`|PSVhBTlgaa	I think you got some good answers from John and Frank. I hope you have abetter understanding now. This is how I would answer.<br>  <br>  OUTSIDE of martial arts/ traditional medicine <br>  being able to harness adrenaline is being able to harness adrenaline<br>  a feeling of energy is a feeling of energy<br>  very good awareness is very good awareness<br>  <br>  just as health means health, speed means speed, balance means balance, strength means strength,<br>  <br>  and CHI means NOTHING ! If someone talks about chi power they are ignorant or trying to con you.<br>  <br>  WITHIN the martial arts/health most of the time an observer can translate the word CHI to mean EFFICIENCY. And efficiency can mean 'knocking someone out with a one inch punch.' If someone throws someone forcefully without using visible force she is using 'chi' which is to say she is making a very efficient movement (which is often not visible and to the observer there is a 'time delay' between the cause and effec). If she is aware of what is going on all around her, eg sparring with 8 opponents simultaneously, she is focussing her attention very efficiently, not using it all on one target. If she causes incredible damage with a single blow she is again using the type of efficency that is trained through martial arts practices such as tai'chi. 98% of the time there is nothing overly mysterious about chi.<br>  <br>  I find BK Frantzis and Park Bok Nam give some good explanations, buy their books now!  or try these two clips and read the comments<br>  <br>  Jerry Shaw Fa Jing<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDS8o_brNnE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDS8o_brN...</a><br>  <br>  Classical Tai Chi - Tao of Martial Arts Applications<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir4vQ8qzpKU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir4vQ8qzp...</a><br>  <br>  BEWARE OF ANYONE TRYING TO IMPRESS WITH THEIR 'CHI POWERS' !  Most youtube clips are not 'fake' but are many are demonstrated in unrealistic situations by people who don't have enough basic abilities ie stability to stand a chance in real combat. Do not learn from them ! A teacher teaches, a show off shows off, big difference.

Camarillo is younger than Harrison and averages 20 more receiving yards per game than Harrison.   More importantly, he's a more important part of Miami's passing attack than Marvin is in Indy and has 16 more catches than Harrison at this point.  Harrison is still capable of a strong game but has shown he can have some stinkers, as well. Camarillo is a steady performer and that's what you need from your fantasy players.|`|SEcM9EDZaa	I had Starvin' Marvin in a dynasty league and I cut him last week to add Steve Breaston primarily because Harrison has been wildly inconsistant this year and. at age 36, has little upside at this point in his career.

BlgZmV6uaa	If last year was any indication he will be great.1 year wonder I doubt it he is going to have Driver and Jennings.Ryan Grant was ok at the end of the year last year.The Packers need to shore up their defense.A little help on the offense line would be a plus as well.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	I really like Aaron Rodgers. I remember his debut last year against the Vikings. Every throw he made was right on the money. He didn't do anything wrong that hasn't been done before by a rookie. He has Driver and Jennings there to help him along his quest and he reminds me of  Matt Cassel - accurate and can run for first downs when the situation calls for it. He just needs to be more aware of the pocket around him and not to panic. Once he masters awareness and focuses a little more on the deep throw, he's going to be a great quarterback. I see a lot of potential in him to bring Green Bay 30 TD's this year, as he just missed that mark last year.|`|uwx7etCXaa	I think he is not as good as he thought of himself.  He needs to play a full season in order to be good.  He played for about 5 or 6 games last season (physically he was there, mentally he was thinking of how better would it had been for the Packers to have Favre back).  He will be your average Joe...hummmm...like DelHomme.  Not a superstar, not the greatest, but a very good player.  I don't see Rodgers in the Super Bowl until probably 2012.  Being a reserve, you don't have the experience necessary to win big games...it will take him a couple of years to reach that level.  Still, he won't be great...Favre has casted an enourmous shadow!|`|PMluTf72aa	well, considering he put up some solid numbers without a consistent running game, awful OL, and terrible defense, i say he'll only get better.  obviously he has to improve in clutch situations, but he's young.  have faith in Rodgers!  Favre is gone and done.  we can all see now that TT made the right choice in sticking with Rodgers, so looking back at that, i'm happy.  Rodgers will never pull off the numerous miracles Favre pulled out because Rodgers is his own man.  Favre was Favre.  Rodgers is Rodgers.  Green Bay is in a new era.  Rodgers is leading the Pack in the new era.  Go Pack Go!|`|N8wNmQShaa	He went 6-10 with a team Favre took 13-3.<br>  <br>  They got worse this year on defense, which means it will be that much harder for Aaron to win.

And why did they lose a bidding war to the Giants?|`|daRDQE9maa	He's got time to improve.I think that after a few seasons he will be a probowl quarterback no doubt.|`|dPbZeAYVaa	he's the next Favre.|`|MbwzSDVDaa	okay party pooper you are a moron Aaron rodgers is a VERY good Qb he  was only the 4th best qb last year under brees warner and rivers i think or was it...id remember but i know he was the 4th best on nfl.com with that being said yes we need to improve our OL and DL but the big thing RoDGERS NEEDS TO BECOME A LEADER! he needs to be able to take over but hes got   great arm probably the  3rd best deep ball in the leuge and once we get our O&DL fixed and rodgers becomes a leader we will be unstopable !|`|M6uIbKXRaa	i think aaron rodgers is overated and the packers need a better quarterback im a bengals fan but my father is a packer fan and when they got rid of farve that was the biggest mistake they ever made

Most of these cannot be uncocked. (in fact, off hand I can't think of one that can) However, it is recommended that they are stored with a couple of pumps of air in them to help prevent seals from drying out, etc.<br>  <br>  If you are dealing with a single pump pneumatic, then again, dry firing shouldn't hurt the weapon unless for some reason it is expressly prohibited in the manual. There are a few with some specific intricate mechanisms which can be damaged by dry fire.<br>  <br>  If you are dealing with a spring piston or gas ram air rifle DO NOT dry fire it. These operate by driving a piston toward the barrel. The piston compresses the air in front of it until it peaks and starts driving the pellet out of the rifle. The seal of the pellet in the barrel is what prevents the piston from slamming into the end of the breech, because the compressed air acts as a cushion slowing the piston down right at the end preventing damage. (This is also the reason why you cannot shoot BB's out of this type of gun and that poorly fitting pellets which don't seal well tend to reduce the life of the gun) This is particularly the case with the magnum power air guns (20+ ft lbs) and the very cheap air guns which are made with lower grade materials.<br>  <br>  Off hand, again I don't know of any models of spring piston/gas ram rifle or pistol that has such a decocking feature. Generally, you would have to have a mechanism that in a controlled fashion allowed the compressed spring to relax, moving the piston forward, without letting it slam forward. Generally these springs are quite powerful, the average person could not get them to full compression in their hands, and so such a mechanism would seem to be very bulky.<br>  <br>  General procedure for this sort of thing is to simply put a pellet in it, and shoot it into a phonebook. A full thickness yellow pages will stop about any conventional pellet (not talking about the solid lead slugs from the really high power PCP guns) and if shot square on will generally not allow a ricochet.<br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|dfBwVxXFaa	don't cock it after your last round fired!|`|xOkwpFX2aa	Once they've been ****** they need to be fired.  needless to say, they don't have to have a round in them.  Take the round out, and dry fire the air rifle.  Rack the pistol back and eject any live rounds, then hold the hammer down and pull the trigger, slowly releasing the hammer so that is does not have enough force to actually fire the gun.|`|XoOanmdraa	cock?????|`|0Iin6kO4aa	you have to shoot it, but shoot at the ground|`|QIwhMrBraa	ur gonna trust the answers on here mate?

If you feel you are unable to play then don't, only if you feel capable of playing then it's considerable. Also if there are upcoming games keep those in mind as well, if this game decides the outcome of whether you will continue on then perhaps it's critical. If there is someone who can play in your place then perhaps it's not. Overall just think about it and decide if it's worth it or needed.|`|dh8QUfywaa	If it hurts today, it's going to hurt a lot more tomorrow.  It's hard, but you have to know where to draw the line with playing and sitting out. Your coach cares more about your health than you being in the last game of the season. You're still a part of the team.<br>  <br>  Tell your parents, tell your coach and sit out tomorrow.  If you don't, your coach is going to see you're hurt and pull you from the game.  And by that point, you may have done more damage.<br>  <br>  You also need to see a Doctor so that you don't end up with a deformed looking big toe that can't be repaired.  Think about it and be smart.|`|ViZyM2AUaa	Can you get to the Doctor before the tournament? You, in all reality, can't do much for a broken toe.

You can get a doctor to fix it later. <br>  <br>  If it's really broken, playing WILL hurt you more, though. <br>  <br>  Be careful. :)|`|Fklbm4Itaa	i think that you shouldnt play on it cuz your toes are a crucial part of your body that you kinda need in soccer...<br>  trust me...i play soccer myself..i should know..<br>  but i also understand that sometimes a game can be very tempting to play in...especially the very last one...<br>  i think that you should see right before your game if your toe hurts badly or not..<br>  if it does then dont play..<br>  if it feels better...then go and kick some butt dude!!!<br>  |`|WCH18RNlaa	Depends on how you feel about it and what your coach says.|`|1mdBsifaaa	get off ur butt, go play thenhomie, stop being a wuss!!!!!!!<br>  |`|TDlvBrd9aa	i say tape it and see how it feels

"<br>  <br>                " If ya' don't ______ I'm gonna shove this board right up your A**" as you hold up the skateboard .<br>  <br>  Lastly: At EACH event ; you give away a fairly cheap ; BUT Autographed Skateboard ......<br>  <br>  NOW: IF you go with my suggestion ; I expect to get 10 Points PLUS the First Autographed Skateboard you do .... <br>  <br>  Best of luck to You !!|`|UGKcFIc8aa	names: <br>  chisel stone w/ finisher of the rock smasher<br>  john hancock w/ the finisher of "the signature"<br>  |`|08YB0TWiaa	say to the females<br>  whats good lil mama?|`|I1yhDKxHaa	You can call yourself Novakane. I always thought that name sounded cool. You could be the biggest ****** ever. In fact that should be your gimmick. Say you take pleasure in ruining other people's day. You could interfere in people's matches for no reason other than to crush their dreams. |`|malFKmFfaa	First of all I'm in a promotion out of Asheville NC. All I have to say is that you need to try to go to other promotions. The way the fed you mentioned does business is wrong. Your gimmick is probably 25% of your work. Every promotion should be more focused more on how you sell the moves and do the moves. That is the foundation to every good wrestler. Look at Hulk Hogen. Great gimmick and well liked to sub-par wrestling fans. But you ask an hardcore wrestling fan that knows what they are talking about says he is horrible because he can't do the moves properly.<br>  <br>  For the opion on what your gimmick should be. I don't know. The safe bet is to intwine your gimmick with something you like. No one can tell what gimmick will hit or miss. All you have to do is try it and see what the fans think. If it doesn't work try another.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|PuU8HC2daa	1) Maybe become a parody of "The Rock" and be called "The Block", with your finishers "The Crowd's Elbow" and "The Block Bottom".<br>  <br>  <br>  2) <br>  <br>  The future of pro wrestling is FINALLY here.<br>  <br>  It is time for you to be electrified.<br>  <br>  |`|sFXGWc67aa	have your name be "Isiah"<br>  <br>  and the catch phrase is maybe, SHUT YOUR MOUTH!<br>  <br>  bulk up dude, i mean seriously jericho is relatively small and he is 225 im 15 and im about as big as you<br>  <br>  be a heel and walk around like you own the place

WjIQJfQdaa	It's easier to gain muscle by having more protein. If you eat a lot of meat and you work out, you will show results as compared to a vegeterian that works out. He may be skinnier (in some cases). |`|7ccc838e6d3938caeb7a1a2e20553e12aa	creatine<br>  |`|ENBX5xloaa	I recommend reading this article at ezinearticles.com called: "Gain Weight, Build Muscle? Follow These 3 Tips and Your Skinny Days Are Over!"<br>  <br>  Here's a snippet:<br>  <br>  If you're struggling to gain some weight and build muscle mass even though you've been eating large meals of healthy foods, then it's time to shake things up. I'll show some simple ways to get your calorie intake up to the point where, with some sensible weight training, your body will be forced to pack on a lot of good weight - and fast too.<br>  <br>  The following 3 tips will have you gaining weight in no time flat...|`|aezWnHI4aa	Buy some Whey, use it after every single workout you do, no matter what it consists of. Eat more. Exercise more. Eat carbs BEFORE you exercise during the day, and stick to high protein and low fat/carb but light dinners (grilled chicken + salad). Eat more fiber. Chew your food. Eat Potatoes/pasta/rice. Weight train in 4 sets of 7 reps.DO NOT weight train more than 3 days in a week. Eat more. Don't go looking for a program, if you're looking to "make muscle building easier" in general. Its mostly about how you weight train and what you eat, rather than what your weight training is. |`|9CBJaHr2aa	I've had the same problem. Try getting I think about 1/2 your body weight in grams of protein. So if you were 200 lbs. get 100 grams of protein. Also, eat 6 meals a day instead of 3.|`|e701007ad46b93f9b846b2b02e5b8179aa	This probably isn't what you want to hear, but I think it just has a lot to do with genetics and the body maturation process.  I was always skinny, even though I was an athlete and worked out a fair amount.  I didn't get decent pecs or shoulders and not a lot of upper body strength. Then in college, I had a pretty big growth spurt. And all of a sudden I saw real results when I worked out.  The good news is, all those guys that can get big when they're younger have weight problems when they get older. So, fear not.  You'll have a much better body than all those guys later in life.  It's like the fact that most female models were unattractively super skinny when they were younger.  Then when they get older, they fill out and have beautiful bodies while all the voluptuous girls in high school get fat. So, I'm sure you can gain some weight and muscle mass by heavy workouts and high caloric intake, but Dude, it just might be your metabolism right now and the fact that your body is going to develop later than some of the guys your age. I couldn't be a linebacker in high school.  Just how it was.  Now I'm an adult, and I'm lucky to be able to stay thin when other guys struggle.  I'll bet you'll be the same.  Good luck
b32e2cd13776356325013f9dc94f58d8aa	for some it's just natural. for others, it gives them a better take off, especially if your first step is an immediate cut
IebGGXLpaa	No effing way. Calvin Johnson for Eddie Royal, maybe. But on the running backs you're WAY getting the short end of the stick. LT is much better than Lynch (though Lynch is doing better than last season), and now that Young is the 'starter' (but he's splitting carries with just about everyone) he's much better than Jonathan Stewart. NO NO NO NO NO!|`|9rO2VMXxaa	yes. i have lt on my team he is awful. go ahead|`|rlhv4JAXaa	No|`|PX4kRP9Kaa	Hell No, are you crazy? these are 3 top tier players you are thinking about trading away for a bunch of nobodies.

AA10789965	the bucs have the better defense..the broncos have the better offense..<br>  pick the broncos to win at home...|`|D8OzQwXKaa	broncos dude|`|r9Yljkcbaa	The Bucs. The Broncos has one of the worst, if not the worst, defense in the entire league right now and they aren't in a prime position for the upcoming years to get good picks in the draft. The Bucs have the talent to contend for their division championship almost every year. If you're looking for a new team to root for and those are your choices, then you'll be cheering more rooting for the Bucs than the Broncos.|`|tPaRZod9aa	The broncos have a much better offence, but the bucs defence dominates. (trust me, im a packer fan) And you cant say that the broncos have the worst defence. I would expect L.J. to do good regardless of what team hes playing, so that last game didnt mean anything. Brandon Marshall has already done better statistically then most recievers the leauge, which is saying somthing considering hes been playing 1 week less than them. Lokk for the broncos to bounce back from last week, and for the buccs to be carless coming off a win.|`|CorE4QEFaa	The Broncos.<br>  <br>  Their offense is better for them than the Buccs defense is for the Buccs.<br>  <br>  They're still rolling on all cylinders, if not for 2 costly fumbles by WRs last week, they'd have beaten the Chiefs. The defense is bad, but it's not as horrible as people are saying.<br>  <br>  Broncos are at home, so take them.|`|rlhv4JAXaa	Broncos |`|wDExPCukaa	It depends the Buccanneers have a better defense Denvers defense is terrible because they have no pass rush if they did theyd be good cuz they have great cornerbacks.And the Broncos offense is far better then Tampa Bay there 4-0 and lead in the league in offense i believe.|`|LePmYY0Baa	Broncos|`|YSGuNj79aa	To tell you the truth the Giants.|`|rhObgP3Caa	the patriots:)|`|8M16jYxdaa	allegan|`|VyZ7CiNSaa	denver!!|`|Tb7IAaxbaa	they are the same

cFdlnyt9aa	CHICAGO!<br>  <br>  That is not even a competition. Vikings are struggling on offence and the bears defence will be shutting them down all day if they bring their B game. The bears haven't been winning everything but their offence is still there and they will win this game because they are a better club on both sides of the ball, right now.|`|OeSZZ3UBaa	Orton has been putting up good yardage passing, but Forte will be facing his toughest challange to date.<br>  Same can be said for MIN.  <br>  CHI pass DEF is ranked 27th (MIN is 15th)<br>  MIN run DEF is 4th and CHI is 5th.<br>  CHI has the edge in the O passing game (12th vs 17th)<br>  MIN has edge in offense rushing (9th vs 13th)<br>  Very close.  <br>  I would start MIN Def over CHI this week.|`|rlhv4JAXaa	Chicago!
hmsCFQocaa	Hester is facing the Minnesota Vikings, who fell apart on Monday Night trying to contain Reggie Bush on punts. Hester was also leading receiver last week for Kyle Orton. Start him and don't listen to inferior suggestions.|`|OeSZZ3UBaa	I would take the risk on Williams.  Hester is facing the 15th ranked pass defense, and a pretty good special teams.|`|rlhv4JAXaa	Since Roy Williams is new, they will either throw to him a lot, or keep him to the side so he can learn the plays. I would take the risk tho
thcr8Y5vaa	Edgar Davids...|`|EMq8LBBfaa	Edgar Davids<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Davids" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_David...</a>|`|68beWslBaa	he is edgar davis he played for tottenham,juventus and for the holland international team.|`|W66MpKejaa	Edgar Davids.<br>  He is currently playing for Ajax.|`|PUkkUsJdaa	 edgar davids<br>  |`|dc0acb26e3e7a4e478e01c648c016d2eaa	his name is edgar davids
brOMrQMjaa	Absolutely.  I'm not even a Patriots fan but Tom needs to get back in there.  Sam Cassel can't bomb it to Moss or Welker like Brady did.  Patriots are nothing what they used to be.  Tom Brady's injury ruined thir playoff opportunities greatly.|`|f8097de47ae58031953feaf9b3ebd6cdaa	WaHOOOOOOOOOO! I  wish, however; they probably do not want to risk further injury..  Man the games ugly without  him, and the guys cannot seem to follow any other leader, they seem like they all need a wake up call. Then the coach needs to say, "Listen up guys, this is how it's gonna be, either follow and be a team, and when Brady is healthy and ready, we will allow him back in the game".  Something like that, what's going on now its seems as though this problem is some sort of football movie I already saw.  They don't need to fall apart, for goodness sakes, Brady needs to be fully recovered.   They are hired to fill in etc. They should be doing their jobs, not flopping together as a team.  |`|mYzp10iGaa	he still has some time left to spend his lady friend, karma|`|BQG15WsHaa	Yeah. Tell him to get off his crutches and man up and play. I want to see him choke again or get injured.|`|rlhv4JAXaa	I think he could, but he would be quite ineffective on crutches |`|jH9t3D7oaa	Oh my god YES!|`|V8Dingqjaa	Well, if a was a Pats fan i would but since i'm Cowboys fan i wan't Tony Romo back...|`|NXwI7ucDaa	Yes, but here is no chance. You will have to live with Matt c the rest of the season.|`|Abuq4PiXaa	Yes.  And the Raiders need Bo Jackson back.
VKDq3Km6aa	touchback|`|KZsdVGJzaa	no but however u can do a drop kick which is similar to a punt u drop the ball on the ground then u kick it which is pretty close to a punt<br>  <br>  if u wanna see one then go to link<br>  <br>  skip to 3 minutes in the vid|`|8wmjYlfaaa	nope!<br>  i asked my dad the same question a while ago, and it will just count as a touchback|`|a7cda7d429aee79ed8584c33c187f65caa	no. but if they bounced the ball off of the ground it would, just like a "drop goal" in rugby.. i remember doug flutie did it a couple years back haha|`|rlhv4JAXaa	In the CFL yes, but in the NFL, unless it hits the ground before you kick it, then it will not count |`|Dyp6a2ziaa	no i wondered this same quiestion and i tryed it on my nfl game and it didn't count
YAp772wTaa	<br>  I'd go with Rice.  Charles will be the feature back in KC...but what has their offense done lately, and BAL's D will probably drop the hammer on him.  Lewis and Rice should be a good combo.|`|GMe8IzzBaa	Im in a very similar situation. I have all those backs as well. I have Jamal Lewis starting on my team. As for your second back, you have to go with Jamaal Charles because:<br>  (1) He tore it up against a premier rush defense last week in TB<br>  (2) He is KC's #1 RB this week<br>  (3) Ray Rice's carries are dependent on the health of McGahee<br>  (4) Baltimore gives goal line touches to McClain|`|9xZFlH45aa	Go with Ray Rice.  Baltimore has a much better D than KC, so they will likely have the ball more than KC.
YAp772wTaa	If you HAVE to have a lineup set buy tonight, I would put in Cotchery and Burress.   If you can hold off until this evening, you might be able to get an injury update on S Jax...if he is a full participant, I would put him in over Cotchery (Rams have beaten the Jets in 6 straight meetings and are not looking like the door mats they were in the first few weeks).  If He he misses practice and is still questionable or doubtful, I'd put in Cotchery.  A few points is better than none.|`|AHX5gEmmaa	I would definitely start Burress and Jackson because if he does he'll run all over the Jets
YAp772wTaa	1) I doubt you meant to post this in the "Fantast Sports" Category.<br>  <br>  2) Why do you need a favorite?  Just like the parts of each parent you like.  Everyone has thier faults.
YAp772wTaa	Boss.  No Doubt.  He has become Eli's favorite end zone target.|`|q9ViQ1ohaa	Boss ,most def ~!!!
YAp772wTaa	I totally agree with the above answer....<br>  <br>  Jones and Colston...with Cotchery in third place (Rams have beat the Jets 6 times in a row)  Jackson would be a good start on paper...but one of KC's strong spots is corner...so he might have a slow day while the rest of the offense piledrives the lackluster chiefs.|`|c56fLEzqaa	Matt Jones for sure.<br>  Colston is projected to finally bust out since coming back from injury.<br>  So start these two guys for sure.<br>  <br>  For your third, I think Cotchery is your best bet to get you more points cause I think it's gonna be the LT show in San Diego.|`|ZygzKdLqaa	all but colston ive had colston the last 2 years but hes a bum this year drop him for more depth in other positions<br>  
YAp772wTaa	I would go Lynch and Turner as RB's.  Both are feature back and get the bulk of the work.  Rice will be splitting playing time, and I doubt he will repeat last weeks performance.  And slaton is great in PPR and return yardage leagues, but he faces a VERY tough D this week.<br>  <br>  At WR MArshall already got you points...I'd go with Curtis.  PHilly and the Giants always seems to have a lot of scoring, and a lot of yardage when they play.<br>  <br>  As a flex....try Moss.  He hasn't lived up tot he hype yet this year, but he faces a Buffalo defense that has some serious injuries right now, and should finally get a lil' help from the New England Running game to open things up some.
YAp772wTaa	If you want cisistency, go with Scaife.  He seems pretty reliable for a few catches every week. And chicago isn;t that good at covering tight ends... Lewis seems to be hit or miss...where he gets nothing, or has a big scoring week.  He is against Detroit  so JAX shoudl put up points...but they might get them from their regular playmakers before looking his way.<br>  <br>  I'd go Scaife|`|c56fLEzqaa	While the Bears' run DEF is one of the best in the league their pass DEF is really bad and Collins' favorite target is Scaife.  In goal line situations where Lendale usually gets the ball, I can see Scaife stealing at least one of his touchdowns.
YAp772wTaa	Mewelde has done GREAT in the few starts he's gottewn in Parker's absense.  I know he is starting this week for PIT, but the question is if Parker is playing at all...if he's going to take 10-20 touches away from Mewelde then stick with Brown and Westbrook.  IF Mewelde will be the feature back, I'd go with him and Westbrook over Brown.  Might be good to check the storyline right before gametime.|`|xnd99EX4aa	Don't stop running Brown this week. He should feast on Seattle. Westbrook may not be as successful with NY. Mwelde may be the way to go.|`|yyRsRFdwaa	Ronnie Brown hosts Seattle 1<br>  Brian Westbrook hosts NY Giants 2<br>  |`|c56fLEzqaa	Brown and Westbrook.<br>  I don't care who he's playing, if he's playing you start Westbrook.|`|qH4svuCIaa	you should never sit westbrook unless hes not playing.  the choice is brown or mewelde... and i have to go brown
6x4kR426aa	You should be slapped...numerous times..<br>  <br>  Lt, because he is playing kansas city, who is worst in the league in rush defence.<br>  <br>  I would then take turner who is playing a ok New orleans D.<br>  <br>  lastly, i would take Ronnie brown. He is facing seattle...that should be enough....<br>  <br>  Westbrook is facing the giants, so he is my lest favorite choice as of now.|`|qH4svuCIaa	Never sit westbrook unless hes out that week.  Don't be affraid of the giants D.. last year he had 158 total yards and a touchdown against the gmen.  Then go LT and Turner.. always start your best guys.  Picking good matchups is a fools game.|`|ZygzKdLqaa	Lt Michael Turner and westbrook. I know brown plays the seahawks but the Seahawks have been playing better its their o thats killing them not their d and honestly has brown doe anything since the 5td week|`|vRqN3ffsaa	How do you have all these guys!?!?!?!  Anyway, Westy, Brown and LT.  Turner's the least consistent of the three.|`|YAp772wTaa	All four woudl be decent starts this week...I'd take a coin toss between sitting Brown or Turner.|`|qPN0i4KHaa	I'd bench Turner, typically Brown but this week Brown plays the soft Seahwaks D
V6x2x8eVaa	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure which player is yours.  Do you already have Barber? or Jennings?<br>  If you are giving away Barber I would advise against it as your other RB's aren't very consistent.  The other thing is that while Jennings would be an asset to your team; you don't need him because your WR's aren't that bad.  Although Edwards can be hard to deal with.<br>  <br>  Don't focus too heavily on matchups.  Sometimes a player can have a bad game, but still have good fantasy production (Forte Vs. Detroit).  Also a matchup that seems bad might not end up that way (Peterson Vs. the Bears).<br>  <br>  I would say that your problem isn't really at RB or WR, it's at QB.  Manning isn't good for too many yards, since the Giants are run team, and Favre has only done well against weak defenses.<br>  <br>  One last thing to consider is that you are in first place with the team you have now.  You may not want to make any major changes to your team or your opponents team because you are already winning most of your matchups.|`|L5TdTsVhaa	I would Accept this trade, you will be getting an excellent receiver in return for a just above-average RB. You have a solid #1 RB and two solid #2 RB's in Tim Hightower and Williams.  Jennings will give you the numbers needed to boost your teams production going into the last few weeks of the season.  He is going to put up bigger numbers than he has over th past few weeks now that the Packer's are going into a more passer friendly section of their schedule.  Also now that Tony Romo is returning I would like to believe that Marion Barber will recieve less looks.|`|5uYL1CTfaa	if i were you, i wouldn't make this trade, altough barber has a few tough matchups the rest of the season, he is an tough back. and he performs well in big games, as long as the offense is healthy. romo should be back this week, and that will make a huge difference. looking at your roster, you have some decent depth at the RB and WR postions, but i think you would hurt it by trading for jennings who has struggled the last couple of weeks. rodgers is one hit away from being out for a few games, and his backups aren't looking to good. |`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	no way|`|YAp772wTaa	NO.  You are pretty set at WR...and Barber will probably be one of your better starts at least 3-4 more times this season.  Towards the end of the season is when a good balanced team wins you championships.  You'd be tradign Barber for a Bench player.
YAp772wTaa	Quinn over Favre.  Farehas only had 2 GOOD fantasy weeks this season.  And I agree Quinn and the short to iintermediatepassing game is gonna be good.<br>  <br>  Hightower is the #1 guy now in ARI and should get you some decent points, and Johnson had better come with ssomething to prove or I think he'll be out after this season in KC.<br>  <br>  I have a similar debate in my head about Thomas Jones....and right now I have him on the Bench against NE.|`|8ul02MOcaa	Go with Favre Jones and Johnson
YAp772wTaa	NO!!!  You wouldn't start Barber over Westbrook or McGahee, you don;t need to start Jennings in front of MArshall or Bowe, and you probably wouldn't need to start Ryan over Favre.  So trading one of the best QB's in the league for 3 bench spots is dumb.|`|A5m6P0FEaa	No, I think you need to stick with Brees|`|8ul02MOcaa	You have favre as a backup you need help in running backs right now because steven is injured and Jennings is always a good add. Ryan is "getting there" but is a good fantasy pproducer|`|OmyxF3x8aa	No, Brees throws for over 300yrd and 3 tds a game
kgBPU4xxaa	This is a choice between two good options. Johnson is the #9 fantasy RB in standard Yahoo scoring. The two defenses they're running against are #20 and #22 only a 6 yd/g and 1 TD difference between the Ds for the year. I'd give Johnson a bit of an edge, but would be happy to play either or both. The Chargers are actually the best run D of the three your RBs, but Moore will continue to be a part of the passing game in Pittsburgh and the Chargers are dead last in defending the pass. I'd still start Johnson and Hightower over Moore this week though.|`|A5m6P0FEaa	I would take Chris Johnson|`|uoa0PBfhaa	That's a tough one, i would say Hightower because he is the starter for Arizona and you never know with johnson if he will get the carries or TD with White also there and in my league Hightower is projected 14 and Johnson is 11 although that does not mean much.  Good Luck |`|K26unMoqaa	You really can't go wrong with either guy but Chris Johnson will be my guy. TEN is a prdominant rushing offense, where with AZ they could score 4 TDs in that game which they probably will this weekend and it could be on 4 TD passes as they are a heavy balanced pass attacking offense. Good Luck|`|YAp772wTaa	I'd take a chance on Hightower.  The Bears showed the world how to slow down the Tennessee Running Game last week....And Johnson still gives up SO many TD's to LEndale White.  Hightower is now the #1 guy in Arizona....A team that puts up lots O' Points.|`|yibBoY3xaa	Johnson, without a doubt
WLwTKS3qaa	Based on  your roaster, your RB section needs some help and I would pick up Mawelde Moore and here is why. Ravens defense is without a doubt one of the top 5 defense in NFL. Not only they have one of the best secondary in the league, they have underrated defensive line as well which consists mix of of very young, explosive, and also experienced players. Although Ward stepped up in his last 2 games, I would not personally expect same outcome against high caliber defense such as Ravens. Moore on the other hand is going against very disappointing Chargers defense. Without Merriman, their Blitz and open run defense got weaker and has only 18 sacks. Moore struggled a bit on his last couple games but due to Big Ben's playing status, he is more likely to carry footballs so I would give Moore a shot. Hope I helped.|`|A5m6P0FEaa	I like Derrick Ward for RB. . .Looks like your team is pretty much stacked otherwise|`|YAp772wTaa	I would drop Edwards and pick up Thigpen for one...The Bills are probably screwed the rest of the season, while Thigpen and the Cheifs are goign to ruin some teams playoff dreams.  I would consider dropping Hasselback too, and going with Matt Ryan...you'll probably score a lot more points that way.<br>  <br>  MEwelde Moore would be a great pickup, if Wille Parker stays injured.  When Mewelde shares the load he's not worth playing.  But if he is the feature back, I would start hiom every week.  If you have an extra roster spot like yuo said you so, I'd pick him up.<br>  <br>  Your WR look ok...You might think of swapping Stallworth for Breaston.  Especially if the league is a PPR league and offers return yardage.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|i0qqBmyHaa	I think you are weakest at QB, I would pick up either Ryan or Thigpen. Probably Thigpen, especially against the saints this weekend. They have no defense.<br>  |`|yibBoY3xaa	Keep an eye on the injury report .... If Fast Willie is still injured, Moore would be a good pick up

Some colleges (like the University of Oregon) offer full ride scholarships and treat them like an other athlete.

It takes chemistry, physical ability, teamwork and strategy.<br>  <br>  If golf or auto-racing can be a sport...cheerleading most certainly is.|`|IGb7gXpZaa	No offense to cheerleaders but cheeleading isn't a sport.First of all and most important it is not officially considered as a sport, it is with no official leagues or sporting rules etc. and although it requires some physical ability there is not competition in cheerleading, thus making it not a sport. Cheerleading is something that you do while playing another competitive game of another sort of event (i.e. American football etc.).

WrDGhduxaa	Depending on how much and for how long you have been running, you need to run 3 to 5 days each week.<br>  You should be doing 2 to 3 miles each day.<br>  If you can't run the entire distance then run until you need to walk and walk until you feel like running again.<br>  You should be able to run the entire distance in 2 to 3 weeks.<br>  Once you are able to run the entire distance, and it doesn't matter how fast or slow, then you can begin to train to run faster. <br>  Continue to run the easy distance 3 days each week, and start doing harder work 2 days, by running one day of tempo runs, you need to run at 70 to 80% of your maximum speed for 10 minutes, rest 5 minutes and run it again.<br>  One day find a distance either on a track or on a trail where you can run 400 meters and 800 meters.<br>  Run intervals of 400 meters doing each 400 in 2:20 seconds, walk or jog to recover for 3 minutes repeat this 5 to 6 times until you are able to do this work out without slowing in the last few intervals.<br>  One day in the next week run 3 to 4 times 800 meters in a little less than 5 minutes, rest 4 minutes between each.<br>  The idea is you are getting your body used to running at your planned race pace, because you must train your body to run at that pace, along with the slow distance work which is developing your cardiovascular system.<br>  You did not say what your current mile time is, so we don't know how much you need to improve. Running 1 mile under 10 minutes is not very fast so you should be able to accomplish this within a month regardless off you present ability.|`|dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	borrow a big scary dog to chase you.  that'll do it!|`|Ia0v7Nx9aa	just try to take longer quicker strides. you also have to be certain to pace yourself. if you are running on a quarter mile track, which means of course it takes 4 laps to complete a mile; you need to make sure that you dont go too fast for the firse 2 laps. <br>  <br>  If you have to run it today, then you cant really help it but if its in a few days you can drink a lot of water, and try to eat grains the night before.|`|qY6bZItsaa	fartleks

These can be picked up by the test. Urine is easy to collect as well so an idea test (if they can't 'go' at the time then a few glasses of water helps them on their way to).<br>  <br>  However it takes a little while for the traces of the drug to show up in the urine and not all drugs are picked up in it either.<br>  <br>  A blood test will show drugs that have recently been taken, they will still be in the blood, so this detects instant performance enhancing drugs used just before the sport. They also pick up traces of drugs used regularly, and also things like unusual testosterone levels in female athletes. <br>  <br>  Done together the 2 test manage to catch most drugs cheats but all the time new drugs are being used and the tests have to be adopted to catch these as well|`|82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  By taking a blood sample it is possible to determine whether an athlete has been doping or taking EPO to enhance their performance.<br>  <br>  By taking a sample, the ratio of red blood cells to blood plasma can be determined. If the red blood cells form a greater portion of the total amount then it is likely the athlete has been using blood doping techniques.<br>  <br>  It would also be necessary to take blood samples to check the athletes health status.|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	to determine if the athlete has been dopping<br>  <br>  dopping is when they take out their blood than 3 days later enjected it bk in

PNaoCmkmaa	Yes it is.<br>  <br>  They had high expectations for him. when he got drafted a couple years back.<br>  <br>  The inconsistent qb play has hurt his play as far as numbers go<br>  <br>  but he's still a great physical specimen.<br>  <br>  what you would call a beast. haha<br>  <br>  he's in the top ten, top seven, tight ends in the game.right now|`|aLcGuGVNaa	Yes, he's Vernon Davis.<br>  <br>  The problem isn't the quarterback play... it's actually the play at right tackle.  Davis hasn't had alot of big numbers because he is an excellent blocker.  He is getting called on to block more often then he is asked to run routes and catch passes.|`|oSEbAU8yaa	Vernon Davis|`|YqkN4nbUaa	yeah he's good, 49ers just need a better quarterback.. alex smith was sad.|`|hfEGHKePaa	He's fast and he can catch. Pretty much what you want in a tight end, but his play has been poor since there is not a good QB in San Fran throughing the ball to him.|`|AA12170560	It is indeed Davis.<br>  <br>  He's as good as his quarterback.<br>  <br>  ...My grandma...what pointy teeth you have!!!|`|GRfnMIQTaa	Vernon Davis, one of the best specimens to ever play tight end, great speed, great hands, not the best blocker but probably a very good player if he were in a good sysytem, unfortuanately he plays for the San Francisco Career Killers (Alex Smith, Davis).|`|8as63GSKaa	They had high expectations when they drafted him first round from maryland four years ago. But he has not lived up to that hype. He is one of the fastest tight ends and maybe if he stops thinking he is all that which he is not, he may play better.|`|SMX228Olaa	It is Vernon Davis and he is a good player but plays for a bad team with a bad QB who can't get him the ball alot. Davis hasn't had any amazing stats at all but has been more of an average player, but it isn't his fault because the 49ers can never find a decent QB.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	it is vernon davis. he could be good but he's not yet

AA12324068	There is a secret door that leads to the locker room, or some other room once they get buried in.|`|0144a616c7371010ae4a7512497bf304aa	What is implied by losing a "Buried Alive" match is that the defeated wrestler really has been "buried alive," and his fate left unclear.<br>  <br>  A once-popular myth held that the losing wrestler simply waited until the end of the show, breathing via an oxygen canister, and then was dug out. However, this is not the case due to such dangers as the wrestler suffocating beneath the weight of the dirt, or the oxygen canister failing.<br>  <br>  In reality, the wrestler booked to be defeated escapes the "grave" via trap door on one side of the pre-dug hole. The wrestler lies in the grave until enough dirt has been piled onto the hole to conceal the escape and create the illusion that he has been "buried alive", at which point he moves into the hidden chamber joined to the grave.<br>  <br>  The construction of the grave is crucial to the act. The grave is a precisely constructed fibreglass fabrication. This can be observed by watching the sides of the grave. If the grave were real, dirt would be cascading down the sides of the grave during the show, which does not happen.<br>  <br>  The grave is constructed backstage as a two-chambered contraption. The first chamber is the open grave. The second chamber is hidden. The pile of dirt is always on the same side of the grave to conceal the exit hatch from the hidden chamber. The open grave has a trapdoor on the right side of it which leads to the hidden chamber in which the wrestler who is "buried alive" sits in until the end of the show. A flashlight, towel and some water are placed in the hidden chamber for the wrestler who stays there until the end of the show. If the match takes place in the middle of the show, an oxygen container might also be provided.<br>  <br>  These two chambers are then covered with sod, and a pile of dirt is placed on top of the grave. To enhance the appearance, real dirt is placed around the grave to create a "mound" effect. Stagehands touch up the grave, add a headstone, and do some last minute cosmetic touches to complete the grave. The headstone serves to block the view of fans behind the grave so they can't see the escape. The pile of dirt serves a similar purpose, to block the view of fans sitting to the right of the grave. Dirt is also placed into the grave to cushion the fall of the wrestler who falls in.<br>  <br>  During the show, the buried wrestler falls into the grave. Once inside the grave, the camera cuts away while the victorious wrestler begins to dump dirt into the grave. The buried wrestler waits for a bit of dirt to fall in before making his escape through the trap door. The buried performer then waits in the chamber until the arena is empty of spectators before he can come out. This myth can also have arguable proof. WWF In Your House: Rock Bottom featured a match between The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin when, part-way through the match, an explosion came from inside the grave and Kane emerged from the grave to attack The Undertaker. It would be unlikely that Kane was just "lying in wait" in the grave, but was indeed in the secret trapdoor when the explosion happened.<br>  <br>  When it is time for the buried wrestler to get out, stagehands take the pile of dirt on top of the hidden hatch and shovel it into the half-filled grave to reveal the hatch. The hatch is opened, and the performer comes out, still alive.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, there are no hidden tunnels to the locker rooms, as WWE plays in arenas either where the floor is concrete, or in ice hockey venues, where either the concrete or the ice under the floorboards would make a tunnel impractical.|`|4133a10daa153b6fa97d3be5665cad5baa	they have a space down below all the dirt where the wrestler stays.

AA10619269	Bookstores like Barnes and Noble sell books that offer coaching strategies, usually authored by a diverse group of coaches.

If you can work on the staff of a coach, even a mediocre coach, to see and understand the basics of how to be a football coach, it will give you the perspective and experience that you need to be a good coach yourself.|`|34390ae1b8bd7a9e278c4247c884acd0aa	Wear your baseball cap the right way for starters.

As you go through the seasons you will learn what does and does not work for the players you coach. Find someone, or several someones, that you can observe, and perhaps interact with, that have been coaching for a while and learn from them. Watch as much football, at all levels and styles, as you can.The more you can learn about the game itself, the better.
