20090304131512AAPdJjh	Environment;Global Warming	Is global warming real, I can't decide with all these new views?	For instance, there are so many different calculations for the warming periods in Roman and Medieval periods, and they were about a thousand years apart so this warming periods in the right time scale, also lots of scientists are denying we have any involment as humans and that we don't have any effect, for instance their used to be more animals releasing Methane if Global warming is true shouldn't it already of happened
20090304141539AAy9bMV	Environment;Global Warming	Does the mechanism that causes the earth to lose H2 also cause the earth to lose N2 and O2 and increase CO2?	 http://etd.caltech.edu/etd/available/etd...        http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/16235...        http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/20... 
20090304141454AAxjec2	Environment;Global Warming	Is it still true that the last 10 years was the warmest decade on record?	This question was recently asked by a denier who wanted to compare 1999-2008 to 1998-2007, which is no different than comparing 1999+2008 to 1998+2007 (since these periods have the years 2000-2006 in common), and is an example of a ridiculous cherrypicking of 4 random data points.      So what is the correct answer to this question?  Was 1999-2008 warmer than any previous decade on record [e.g. 1989 or 1990-1998]?  Best answer goes to the best data analysis.  Worst answer goes to the biggest cherrypicker.

20090304133659AAwe7kC	Environment;Global Warming	An Inconvenient Truth in elementary schools?	I recently learned that my fifth grade sister's science class watched Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" for the last few days of class. Am I the only one who finds something wrong with this? I mean, if you believe in global warming, fine. If you don't, fine. But it seems that elementary schools are increasingly becoming ways for individuals, or more specifically Democratic politicians and thinkers, to force their opinions on children. I really don't see how this biased movie, one who's credibility was brought in to question by some scientists for manipulating data (mainly by altering the axes of many of the graphs to magnify minute changes in temperature and carbon emissions) is relative or even understandable to 10 year old children. I truly feel that if we spent more time teaching more math and "real" (physical) science in schools, instead of focusing so much on educating them on the ecosystem and how horrible humans are to the environment, that maybe we wouldn't be so far behind the developing nations of India and China in math and science. (India and China by the way have some of the world's worst pollution standards and couldn't care less about the environment.)      Anyway, I just wanted some feedback on this topic, and would appreciate any opinion.

20090304142315AA8aFBr	Environment;Other - Environment	Why don't people recognize overpopulation is the #1 problem in the world?	Is it because we are all part of it?  Is it because it can't be blamed on the "greedy capitalists" (but it could be twisted that way) by the neo-Marxists?  Is it because we can't (sniff, whimper) possibly blame poor, suffering people for their suffering; instead we will find someone else to blame for it?      It's too late now to continue playing those stupid games.  Excess population caused the economic and environmental problems that have come to crises.  Population reduction must start now.  Even so, population will increase for at least two more generations before today's reduction efforts would start a decrease.

20090304153113AAnih4m	Environment;Global Warming	To all the global warming enthusiast?	Many say that scientist believe that the earth is warming and we are the cause but fail to mention solar spots, water vapor man only contribute 3% of CO2 worldwide and similar amount of scientist that believe it is a bunch of crock    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sci...       Here is my question who do you think has more credibility someone doing independent research or someone receiving government grant money. I remember cigarette researchers testifying in front of congress that cigarettes does not cause cancer. I did not believe them then because I remember thinking why would they bite the hand that feed them.   Please no (scientist don't lie) they are no different from whores give them enough money and they will say anything. So what made you decide to believe the former?
