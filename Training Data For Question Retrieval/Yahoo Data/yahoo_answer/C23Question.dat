20090220081312AAfXUw7	Politics & Government;Politics	Should I be upset over the taxes I pay?	This is from a letter I received from the IRS yesterday.      Based on your anticipated income tax for 2009 which is $900,258. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $0 withheld for 2009, leaving $900,258 due when you file your return. To meet your anticipated tax of $900,258, change your current withholding arrangement by claiming 0 allowances plus an additional amount of $219,925 for the balance of 2009. Here’s how:          * Enter 0 on line 5 of your Form W-4.       * Divide $219,925 by the number of paydays remaining in 2009 and enter the result on line 6 of your Form W-4. This is the extra amount you need to have withheld each payday to ensure that you do not have too little withheld. Assuming 10 paydays remain for a monthly pay frequency, this amount is $21,992.50.       * Check the “Married” box on your Form W-4.      Assuming this recommendation is in effect for the rest of 2009, your withholding will approximately equal your anticipated tax, and any refund or balance due should be less than $25.

20090220081643AAkZ1iT	Politics & Government;Politics	Did Obama really give a free ride to Palestinians to live in the US? What are your thoughts?	I just got this email and I checked the sources...I'm just amazed.       http://www.thefederalregister.com/d.p/20...     http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-24...          Obama Signs Presidential Determination Allowing Palestinians Loyal to Hamas to Resettle In US    President Barack Obama has signed an executive order (presidential determination) allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to resettle in the United States.   Sure, what can go wrong when we allow hundreds of thousands of people who have been, as Mark Steyn memorably described, "marinated" in a "sick death cult," who voted for Hamas, and 55% of whom support suicide bombings to live here -- and at the American taxpayers' expense: By executive order, President Barack Obama has   ordered the expenditure of $20.3 million in migration assistance to the Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza. The "presidential determination" which allows hundreds of thousands of Palestinians with ties to Hamas to resettle in the United States was signed on January 27 and appeared in the Federal Register on February 4.   President Obama's decision, according to the Register, was necessitated by "the urgent refugee and migration needs" of the "victims."   Few on Capitol Hill took note that the order provides a free ticket replete with housing and food allowances to individuals who have displayed their overwhelming support of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the parliamentary election of January 2006.      Let's review some of Barack Obama's most recent actions since he was inaugurated:      * His first call to any head of state as president was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of Fatah party in the Palestinian territory.      * His first one on one interview with any news organization was with Al Arabia television.      * He ordered Guantanamo Bay closed and all military trials of detainees halted.    * He ordered all overseas CIA interrogation centers closed.   * He withdrew all charges against the masterminds behind the USS Cole and 9/11.       *  he is allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refuges to move to and live in the US at American taxpayer expense.             So...where is our say in all this?      What happened to the US support of Israel?      What about Israeli refugees who have been attacked by Palestinians for years?      Why is he giving them refuge in the US?  Doesn't that seem a little far from home?
20090220082535AAb2Uw4	Politics & Government;Politics	What has President Obama done now?	So its not just good enough to destroy the economy, now President Obama has take his show on the road and is trying to destroy the universe. What say you?      Huge gamma-ray blast spotted 12.2 bln light-years from earth           The spectacular blast, which occurred in September in the Carina constellation, produced energies ranging from 3,000 to more than five billion times that of visible light, astrophysicists said.   "Visible light has an energy range of between two and three electron volts and these were in the millions to billions of electron volts," astrophysicist Frank Reddy of US space agency NASA told AFP.   "If you think about it in terms of energy, X-rays are more energetic because they penetrate matter. These things don't stop for anything -- they just bore through and that's why we can see them from enormous distances," Reddy said.   A team led by Jochen Greiner of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics determined that the huge gamma-ray burst occurred 12.2 billion light years away.   The sun is eight light minutes from Earth, and Pluto is 12 light hours away.   Taking into account the huge distance from earth of the burst, scientists worked out that the blast was stronger than 9,000 supernovae -- powerful explosions that occur at the end of a star's lifetime -- and that the gas jets emitting the initial gamma rays moved at nearly the speed of light.   "This burst's tremendous power and speed make it the most extreme recorded to date," a statement issued by the US Department of Energy said.   Gamma-ray bursts are the universe's most luminous explosions, which astronomers believe occur when massive stars run out of nuclear fuel and collapse.   Long bursts, which last more than two seconds, occur in massive stars that are undergoing collapse, while short bursts lasting less than two seconds occur in smaller stars.   In short gamma-ray bursts, stars simply explode and form supernovae, but in long bursts, the enormous bulk of the star leads its core to collapse and form a blackhole, into which the rest of the star falls.   As the star's core collapses into the black hole, jets of material blast outward, boring through the collapsing star and continuing into space where they interact with gas previously shed by the star, generating bright afterglows that fade with time.   "It's thought that something involved in spinning up and collapsing into that blackhole in the center is what drives these jets. No one really has figured that out. The jets rip through the star and the supernova follows after the jets," Reddy said.   Studying gamma-ray bursts allows scientists to "sample an individual star at a distance where we can't even see galaxies clearly," Reddy said.   Observing the massive explosions could also lift the veil on more of space's enigmas, including those raised by the burst spotted by Fermi, such as a "curious time delay" between its highest and lowest energy emissions.   Such a time lag has been seen in only one earlier burst, and "may mean that the highest-energy emissions are coming from different parts of the jet or created through a different mechanism," said Stanford University physicist Peter Michelson, the chief investigator on Fermi's large area telescope.   "Burst emissions at these energies are still poorly understood, and Fermi is giving us the tools to understand them. In a few years, we'll have a fairly good sample of bursts and may have some answers," Michelson said.   The Fermi telescope and NASA's Swift satellite detect "in the order of 1,000 gamma-ray bursts a year, or a burst every 100,000 years in a given galaxy," said Reddy.    Astrophysicists estimate there are hundreds of billions of galaxies.    The Fermi gamma-ray space telescope was developed by NASA in collaboration with the US Department of Energy and partners including academic institutions in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden and the United States.

20090220085057AAE8UD9	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this a prime example on WHY we wernt allowed to read the bill after it was "finished"?	And before it was signed?      This provision was added in the last few hours and hidden in the bill....      In the name of accountability and transparency, Congress has given the RAT Board the authority to ask “that an inspector general conduct or refrain from conducting an audit or investigation.” If the inspector general doesn’t want to follow the wishes of the RAT Board, he’ll have to write a report explaining his decision to the board, as well as to the head of his agency (from whom he is supposedly independent) and to Congress. In the end, a determined inspector general can probably get his way, but only after jumping through bureaucratic hoops that will inevitably make him hesitate to go forward.      The name of the RAT Board is Orwellian, as is its appearance in the administration that claimed it would have the most transparency in American history.  Putting IGs under Nancy Pelosi’s thumb eliminates transparency and accountability, and calling it an Accountability and Transparency Board is a grim joke.  It’s simply a mechanism to shut down potentially embarrassing (or worse) IG investigations while commanding others against political foes       http://hotair.com/archives/2009/02/19/sm...       what does this have to do with stimulus?

20090220083410AAMzl0j	Politics & Government;Politics	Would Czech President Vaclav Klaus make a better president of the United States than Obama?	 http://klaus.cz/klaus2/asp/clanek.asp?id...       Yesterday, President Klaus gave a speech to the European Parliament that nearly caused a riot.  Claus, a proponent of "Austrian" economics (the most prominent proponent of "Austrian" economics in America is Congressman Ron Paul, well-known as the most Capitalistic member of the House of Representatives) and a professional economist, gave a speech yesterday to the European Parliament advocating a free market economy and criticizing the socialist European Parliament.  Here are some excerpts of his speech (full speech @ link):      "Moreover, it is self evident, that one or another institutional arrangement of the European Union is not an objective in itself; but a tool for achieving the real objectives. These are nothing but human freedom and such economic system that would bring prosperity. That system is a market economy."      "The present decision making system of the European Union is different from a classic parliamentary democracy, tested and proven by history. In a normal parliamentary system, part of the MPs support the government and part support the opposition. In the European parliament, this arrangement has been missing. Here, only one single alternative is being promoted and those who dare thinking about a different option are labelled as enemies of the European integration. Not so long ago, in our part of Europe we lived in a political system that permitted no alternatives and therefore also no parliamentary opposition. It was through this experience that we learned the bitter lesson that with no opposition, there is no freedom. That is why political alternatives must exist."      "This is closely connected with the question of prosperity. We must say openly that the present economic system of the EU is a system of a suppressed market, a system of a permanently strengthening centrally controlled economy. Although history has more than clearly proven that this is a dead end, we find ourselves walking the same path once again. This results in a constant rise in both the extent of government masterminding and constraining of spontaneity of the market processes. In recent months, this trend has been further reinforced by incorrect interpretation of the causes of the present economic and financial crisis, as if it was caused by free market, while in reality it is just the contrary – caused by political manipulation of the market."      "Many of you certainly know the name of the French economist Frederic Bastiat and his famous Petition of the Candlemakers, which has become a well-known and canonical reading, illustrating the absurdity of political interventions in the economy. On 14 November 2008 the European Commission approved a real, not a fictitious Bastiat’s Petition of the Candlemakers, and imposed a 66% tariff on candles imported from China. I would have never believed that a 160-year-old essay could become a reality, but it has happened. An inevitable effect of the extensive implementation of such measures in Europe is economic slowdown, if not a complete halt of economic growth.  The only solution is liberalisation and deregulation of the European economy."

Franken blamed everything on his accountant of 18 years (do democrats take any blame for themselves), saying he failed to report the income from the comedian’s celebrity appearances and speeches in those states where he made money outside of Minnesota and New York, where he lives. Franken claimed he overpaid taxes in those two states and will file for refunds.       Last April, the California Tax Franchise Board revealed that Franken owed the state $5,800 in taxes, fines, and penalties because he did not file returns in 2003 through 2007. Franken then admitted that he owed more than $50,000 in back taxes to 17 states      So basically he owes $70,000.

20090220094145AAqcVhO	Politics & Government;Politics	Instead of lay-offs, why can't companies reduce employee work weeks?	This is also a good idea for the auto industry to consider. What good is an auto bail-out if people aren't buying cars?       Instead, the auto manufacturing industry in the USA should become a part-time job for everyone, including the management.  Perhaps Mondays, Wednesdays, and Friday mornings.      The rest of the week you seek another part-time job to fill in the hole. Do this to everyone instead of laying off 50% of the staff.      Why can't American companies try this instead?

I know it used to be like 2.5% per year or something which is why banks give 3% intirest rate on money in your savings so that it at least maintains its value against inflation but what is the number now?       How much interest do your investments have to accrue to at least stay equal to the current inflation rate?

Because of the internet I have learnt so much about false flag operations and that the governments of our countries do get involved in terrorist activities to pre-empt certain actions. I just wonder why the general public is so sheepish and brainwashed into believing what they are told. I mean Jesus is God that is the only truth.

But the people who won't even work a 40 hour work week are not "Lazy and thieves" for wanting to take my money.      40 hour work week ha-ha!  What was it the week of Christmas the last time I saw one of those!      Poor people, (I know I was one I made $12,000 in 1994 for the year!) think that rich people's money just falls out of the sky.  The fact is every "Rich" person I know with few exceptions works at minimum a 60 hour work week.  When I was poor I worked 40 hours....I haven't been poor since I started working more.  I am not talking about an hourly wage either...hourly pay is for suckers who want to spend their lives being told what their value is!      BTW, don't tell me I had any advantages or help either, because I left home at 15, spent 2 1/2 years living on the streets of Detroit and have only a 10th grade formal education and a GED.  How did I get from there to here?  (BTW, "here" is really nice)  I read a book a day for many years as well as worked my butt off.  I have no sympathy for "The poor" because I can tell you that nearly 100% are poor due to their own poor decision making, I was poor until I made better decisions too!

If you sign a home loan, you are responsible for it, if the lender who gave the loan wants to re-do it then that's up to them. I lost my job in November I don't want a government handout, I got my *** back in school to learn a new trade so I can find a job. I was just a production worker making $10.00 an hour, my wife is a teacher making $30,000, so money is tight, but I did what I felt gave my family and I the best options on bettering our lives, not the easy way out. I know what it is like to be broke, I grew up in the projects, food stamps, reduced lunch, no lights, no phone. My sister and I got out of that, so it is very possible to do it, it just takes something that this country is losing, guts, determination, and hard work.

20090220103405AARDqnG	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Why are the UK and the USA so close?	The UK controlled the American colonies, but after all these years the USA and the UK are probably the closet allies in the world. Take for  example in France was in danger the US probably would get involved but it would take longer then say if the UK was in Danger, world war 1 and 2 are a good example of what i am talking about. During that war(2) the US, was not willing to get involve, when the French were losing, even though they sent supplies to the UK, and volunteers to help the UK, and not to the French(I think, i could be wrong on that) Even though it was the French to help get the US Independence. Even Now  when the Queen came to the white house, made sure the white house was perfect and more secure for her then anybody else. Also the public outrage at Prince Harry being in Afghanistan over in the USA was huge and many also demanded that he be removed and brought back to the UK. I guess what i am saying in short is why is the US so close to the UK?
20090220103406AAQaL2U	Politics & Government;Government	Why do they remove questions and comments that question the official story of 9/11?	I have alot of questions after doing research on 9/11. I have asked these questions and yahoo erases them. They are important questions that should be answered. Why were standard operating procedures for dealing with hijacked airliners not followed that day?    Why were the extensive missile batteries and air defenses reportedly deployed around the Pentagon not activated during the attack?    Why did the Secret Service allow Bush to complete his elementary school visit, apparently unconcerned about his safety or that of the schoolchildren?    Why hasn't a single person been fired, penalized, or reprimanded for the gross incompetence we witnessed that day?    Why haven't authorities in the U.S. and abroad published the results of multiple investigations into trading that strongly suggested foreknowledge of specific details of the 9/11 attacks, resulting in tens of millions of dollars of traceable gains?    Why has Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator who claims to have knowledge of advance warnings, been publicly silenced with a gag order requested by Attorney General Ashcroft and granted by a Bush-appointed judge?    How could Flight 77, which reportedly hit the Pentagon, have flown back towards Washington D.C. for 40 minutes without being detected by the FAA's radar or the even superior radar possessed by the US military?    How were the FBI and CIA able to release the names and photos of the alleged hijackers within hours, as well as to visit houses, restaurants, and flight schools they were known to frequent?    What happened to the over 20 documented warnings given our government by 14 foreign intelligence agencies or heads of state?    Why did the Bush administration cover up the fact that the head of the Pakistani intelligence agency was in Washington the week of 9/11 and reportedly had $100,000 wired to Mohamed Atta, considered the ringleader of the hijackers?    Why did the 911 Commission fail to address most of the questions posed by the families of the victims, in addition to almost all of the questions posed here?       WHY IS YAHOO FORBIDDING THE ALTERNATIVE STORY? WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO COVER UP THE ANSWERS?

20090220104301AA2wP3z	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	This cop used blackmail, what do we do?	An ex friend of mine (Sarah) got one of our mutual friends (John) into trouble in a sting operation (She is going to school to become a cop) so my boyfriend was really upset because John is one of his best friends. He put up on his facebook status some offensive stuff about Sarah (like F*** you Sarah!). So being part of law enforcement, so to say, she had this cop who claimed to be a detective lieutenant call my boyfriend and leave him a message to call him back. So my boyfriend did and the cop was like "you need to take this off of your facebook... you wouldn't want anything bad to happen to your friend would you?" And then he threatened to arrest my bf. Then my bf pretty much called him out on his blackmail. The cop said it was harassment but my bf said it was an indirect statement, also freedom of speech. He never actually said anything to her. What can we do about this situation? A cop cannot legally arrest him for something like this right? And he certainly can't punish John for what my bf said either right?

So, translating that to BO's plans, it seems that the choices are now:      1 - Live beneath your means and save for a rainy day.   2 - Live paycheck to paycheck and just scrape by, but have nicer things.   3 - Spend much more than you earn, have REALLY nice things (and more of them) and then take money from your neighbors to pay for it all.      There was a time in America when people had enough pride that they wouldn't steal from their neighbors even for necessities. Now they want to steal just for luxuries.

20090220105743AAGvcFl	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Case against apartment charging more for 1st February move out?	I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado.   My lease was to expire on February 1st, 2009. I had given adequate notice. I moved out of my apartment and returned it to their control on January 31st, 2009. There was a verbal discussion about the condition of the apartment. The property manager, stated there were no problems with the exception of a small patch job needed in the carpet. She assured us it wouldn't cost much, so we did not get our own estimators to evaluate the cost.    Our rent was $725 in the lease contract. There was a rent addendum reducing the monthly rent by $200, for a total of $525 a month. We also had a garage, which was rated at $75 a month. We had a $50 deposit for the garage, and a $150 deposit for the apartment.       On our move-out, we were charged    $75 for the garage rental    $725 for the rent for the month of February    $484.95 for Carpet replacement.       We were given the following credits:    $7.14 for Renewal Concession of 1 Day (For being all moved out and cleaned up on Jan 31st)   $200 for our security deposit credit    $699.11 for rent for 27 days    $72.32 for garage rental for 27 days       I want to know what kind of case I have to    1) Dismiss the difference in $25.89 for Rent, and the $2.68 for the Garage, or, failing that, get them to properly apply the concession to the monthly rent, placing the rent at $525 as per our contract.    2) Get the apartment to pay for all legal fees in full       I do not believe their creative bookkeeping to get this extra $28.57 was legal, and I do not want them to think they can get away with it. I don’t want to pay $220 to a lawyer to find out I don’t have a case, although I do have a few thousand tucked away that I will use to pay one if I do. So, do I have a case?

20090220120318AAd2T78	Politics & Government;Politics	Does the average democrat politician owe about $42,000 in taxes?	So far this year the average democrat politician owes about $42,000 in taxes.  The tax cheats are:      Tom Daschle - $128,000   Tim Geithner - $35,000   Al Franken - $70,000   Nancy Killefer - $1,000   Hilda Solis’s - $6,400   Charlie Rangel - $10,000         That is $250,400 in taxes collected.  So is it safe to say that the average democrat politician will owe about $42,000 in taxes.        If we assume that the tax issues continue down the line in Congress and each of them owe on average $42,000, how much extra would the IRS receive.        So if there are 289 democrats in the house of representatives and they owe on average $42,000, that is $12,138,000.        In the senate there are 59 democrats.  If each owed $42,000 that is an additional $2,478,000      So all together the democrats could owe about $14 Million to the IRS.  This would be a good math problem for our teenage friends.

20090220114906AA9aHT9	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Associate in a knifepoint robbery. What sentence to expect?	Basic outline of the story: My cousin Kyle was getting a taxi with his friends Mark and John. Kyle wanted to be dropped off in town, but Mark said he wanted to go to a nearby village first, and as he was paying the fare its up to him. When they arrived, Mark pulled a knife out and demanded cash from the taxi driver. Kyle was not prepared to argue or try to get out of the cab when Mark (who is a class A drug user, therefore could be dangerous) had a knife and might not have been scared to use it. Mark then forced the taxi driver out of the cab and drove off in the car, and later set it on fire and abandoned it. im not sure whether Kyle was there or not when they burnt the cab (destroying/helping to destroy evidence). A month later they were all arrested and charged with robbery. Once arrested, Kyle learnt that Mark had been charged with 4 of these robberies, all from the same taxi firm and phoned from his mobile number. John also told police that Mark had locked him in his flat once and demanded drugs or he would chop Johns fingers off. Him and the taxi driver have both told police that Kyle was there (cab driver picked him in identity parade) but did not actually commit the crime of robbery.       Kyle has pleaded guilty and will be sentenced next week. His barrister has said that he could get 5 years, or 3 with a nice judge. What do you think?? I cant understand how he can get that long when he didnt actually do anything. He is guilty of not getting out the taxi, and not stopping it. but who would mess with a man with a knife?? What do you think the best possible outcome will be??

The District took action against the Murrays and was awarded nominal damages.      Did the Murray brothers commit any offence by building the wharves where they did? How could this problem be corrected? Why was the District awarded only nominal damages?

WASHINGTON – A government lawsuit Thursday seeks the identities of tens of thousands of possible U.S. tax cheats who hid billions of dollars in assets at the Swiss-based bank UBS AG. A defiant Swiss president pledged to maintain his country's bank secrecy laws.      In the suit filed in Miami, the Obama administration wants UBS to turn over information on as many as 52,000 U.S. customers who concealed their accounts from the U.S. government in violation of tax laws.      "At a time when millions of Americans are losing their jobs, their homes, and their health care, it is appalling that more than 50,000 of the wealthiest among us have actively sought to evade their civil and legal duty to pay taxes," the acting assistant attorney general, John DiCicco, said in a statement.      A deal announced Wednesday provides access to about 250 to 300 UBS customers who used Swiss bank secrecy laws to hide assets. To avoid prosecution, UBS agreed to pay $780 million. The bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, said UBS accepted "full responsibility" for helping its U.S. clients conceal assets from the Internal Revenue Service.      See, we are going after your tax frauds who have been frauds for decades, not paying taxes. Isn't this just more Republican hypocrisy? And these people DID NOT pay their taxes! BUT they will!

My son is friends with & on the same baseball team as a neighbor's child.  Our Landlord came over today & said that the boy down the road wasn't allowed to come over anymore because his dogs are vicious & dangerous.  I have told them several times that his dogs are just big & totally harmless.  She got kinda crappy with me & said I needed to talk to her husband about it then.   I just don't think they can tell me who my son can play with or dictate who our company is at all.  We live just outside city limits so there is no leash law in this area.  The Owner has said that the neighbors dogs have charged at the maintenence man & they are in conflict with the neighbors up the road.  We are fairly new to the neighborhood & get along with the neighbors, the maintenance man & the landlord but this is getting to be to much.  The maintenance man actually lives closer to the neighbor than I do and if the dogs come to my house with the boy they are farther away from him than at their own house.  I just want to know if I can tell my land lord that they are not gonna bring me not their mess.  Or if I can say you cant tell me who I can have for company with my son.  The neighbor's son is a good kid, he's homeschooled, on the little leauge baseball team, his adult brother coaches one of the teams & his dad coaches another & his mom is a painter/artist.  They also own a family business: screen printing.  They are not thugs or country trash, they seem to be really good people.  What should I do tell my son that he can't play with his freind & teammate anymore because the landlord said so?  That can't be legal. Someone help, please?

20090220114846AAqEv7o	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Question about law on rape and spiking drinks (in UK)?	Hypothetical situation. A gang goes to a party. Guy A spikes Girl's drink to 'loosen her up', no intention of rape or any harm coming to her. Later on that night everyone refuses to take Girl home so she attempts to leave by herself and that night she is raped by Guy B.       If she goes to court and can prove that Guy B raped her and that Guy A spiked her drink, will anything happen to Guy A because Guy A didn't spike her drink to harm her but nonetheless it's because of him that Girl wasn't able to make her way home safely.       Thanks all in advance. I would just like to know the legal side of things, this hasn't happened but I'm curious.

BRUSSELS – The European Union has turned into an undemocratic and elitist project comparable to the Communist dictatorships of eastern Europe that forbade alternative thinking, Czech President Vaclav Klaus told the European Parliament on Thursday.      Klaus, whose country now holds the rotating EU presidency, set out a scathing attack on the EU project and its institutions, provoking boos from many lawmakers, some of whom walked out, but applause from nationalists and other anti-EU legislators.      Klaus is known for deep skepticism of the EU and has refused to fly the EU flag over his official seat in Prague during the Czech presidency, saying the country is not an EU province.      He said current EU practices smacked of communist times when the Soviet Union controlled much of eastern Europe, including the Czech Republic and when dissent or even discussions were not tolerated.

Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886)      In 1879 in the state of Illinois, Herman Presser belonged to an organization which engaged in military exercises as one of its functions. Presser paraded with other members of the organization through the streets of Chicago carrying guns.      Presser was arrested and accused of violating an Illinois law which made it unlawful for men who were not part of the militia of the state to parade with arms without a license from the governor. He was convicted and fined ten dollars. Presser took his case to the Supreme Court of Illinois and the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.      He then appealed his case to the Supreme Court of the United States.       QUESTION: Would you uphold Presser’s conviction, or would you overturn it? Why?

I'm not going to off myself or anything, but the truth is, when I go to sleep tonight, here in just a few minutes, I hope that I never wake up.  I am SO SICK of this time.  This is the age of the GREEDY MORON.  I want to be greedy and grab myself a little peace.  Eternal slumber sounds like a winner.      From Pearl Harbor to OKC, from the 911 farce to the war on terror, from freedom in 1912 to slavery in 1913 when the Federal Reserve took over, I am SICK of this time in history.  It's comprised of nothing but GREEDY people on the top of the foodchain and a bunch of idiot greedy wannabe's from the top down.  It's sickening.      So all of you all pull your collective thoughts together and wish me dead so I can sleep through all this BULL$Hi t and you call can just keep on sucking up to the Bush's and the Obama's of this world.  It's sick and so are you.      I can honestly say that I am one of the few sane people left.  And believe me, it's VERY lonely.      For the record: An airplane traveling at 500 mph that hits the side of a concrete building will leave WING PRINTS in the concrete.  Hence, the PERFECT CIRCULAR HOLE in the side of the Pentagon indicates that it is IMPOSSIBLE that an airplane hit it...hence the reason the Federal government STOLE the video footage from the Serhaton Inn, the Citgo gas station and the VADOT cameras on 9/11.  They couldn't allow those videos to surface or their entire plan for the war on terror would have been scrubbed and a lot of scumbag politicans and bankers would have been executed for high treason.      But hey, who cares?  And that's my question for this space I'm taking up on Yahoo's servers.  Who cares?

20090220121803AAo2zR4	Politics & Government;Politics	Obama Appointee in A Classified Info Scandal??? What happened to the ethical standards Obama promised?	The appointment of John Deutch to an advisory panel on spy satellites violates President Obama’s pledge to hold everyone in his administration to the highest ethical standards.       Deutch, who headed the CIA from May 1995 to December 1996, agreed in writing in January 2001 to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents. Just after that, President Clinton pardoned him and 175 others as Clinton was leaving office. Deutch’s infraction was thus more serious than Tim Geithner’s or Tom Daschle’s failure to pay income taxes.       “Deutch essentially walked away from what is one of the most egregious cases of mishandling of classified information that I have ever seen, short of espionage,” Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said after the pardon was announced.       Deutch placed 17,000 CIA files, including files classified TOP SECRET/CODEWORD and those referring to highly sensitive covert operations, on his unclassified home computers. One such file was a memo to Clinton and then-Vice President Al Gore. It noted that the information was so sensitive that Deutch was sending it to only a few other people, including FBI Director Louis Freeh and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.

Israeli National News report 2/3/09:      Obama Dropping 'War on Terror' from U.S. Diplomatic Lexicon      (IsraelNN.com) As part of a new campaign to reach out to the Arab world, newly inaugurated United States President Barack Hussein Obama is dropping the phrase "war on terror" from the U.S. diplomatic lexicon.      The catchphrase, which was introduced to America after the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, is being replaced as Obama's new administration works on raising the U.S.'s esteem in the Muslim world and distancing itself from George W. Bush's policies in Iraq and Afghanistan. The phrase "war on terror" has become associated with anti-Islamic or anti-Arab sentiments, according to national security analyst Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington in statements to the Associated Press.      Instead of fighting a 'war on terror', the Obama administration will fight a war against 'extremism'.

AP      Editor’s Note: Liz Peek is a financial columnist and the author of wOw’s Wall Street Weekly and SHEconomics.      Today marks the one-month anniversary of President Obama’s inauguration. In his brief time in office, the president has overseen three massive new spending initiatives — the $787 billion stimulus bill, the trillion-dollar financial stability initiative and, most recently, the $275 billion mortgage assistance program.         That’s a lot of activity, and a ton of money, but so far the reaction to the new administration’s programs has been decidedly negative. Investors, among others, have panned the plans; the stock market is off nearly 10% from the day before the inauguration, or more than 800 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

A few days ago I was stopped by a cop and he charged me with my third DUI.  The first 2 I got over a 3 week period.  I wasn't convicted for the first when I got my second.  So I have 2 first offense DUI's.  I was 21 at the time.        A few days ago I was stopped and blew a .09 (.08 is the legal limit) I'm +5 points on my driving record, haven't had a ticket since 02', and while I was being booked, the officers had trouble understanding I had 2 first offenses, and eventually wrote me up for my 3rd DUI.      My trial is in 2 months, and before I get a lawyer I wanted to research this.  I understand 3 separate convictions could be seen as 3 DUI's, but technically I never received a DUI second offense.  Is it possible this could be thrown out do to a technicality?  If not, dropped to a second offense which would keep it as a misdemeanor?  I'm scared I'll be going to jail for the 90 mandatory minimum, and I was hoping I could get some insight on this before I call a lawyer.  Any and all help is appreciated,      Thanks

Will he bail out Detroit? Will he move to revamp the health-care system? Will he unveil a comprehensive plan to revive the economy? Here’s a good way to start, Mr. Obama: categorically oppose preventive detention. According to the New York Times, Obama’s hope for closing the prison at Guantanamo raises concerns among his advisors over what to do with the 250 detainees being held there. Specifically, what about the ones who might be acquitted if tried in a criminal court or who can’t be prosecuted at all? With typical criminal suspects, either of those two outcomes means release. But, “Even some liberals are arguing that to deal realistically with terrorism, the new administration should seek Congressional authority for preventive detention of terrorism suspects deemed too dangerous to release even if they cannot be successfully prosecuted,” the Times reports. “The president-elect’s transition office would not comment on whether that idea was even under discussion. But human rights groups have been mounting arguments to counter pressure that they say is building on Mr. Obama to show toughness, perhaps by echoing the Bush administration’s insistence that some detainees may need to be held indefinitely.... But particularly inasmuch as the Bush administration invoked that authority [of international law] as a basis for its much-criticized detention policies, a move by Mr. Obama to seek explicit authorization for indefinite detention without trial would be seen by some of his supporters as a betrayal.” Indeed. Obama, like Bush, has talked about closing Guantanamo, a symbol of American barbarity throughout the world. Some of the prisoners have been locked up there without being charged since 2001. People assume the prisoners are terrorists, but for many of them that may not be true. Some number of them are held on the basis of, at best, meager evidence. As a McClatchy Newspapers investigation found, “Dozens of men — and, according to several officials, perhaps hundreds — [have been] wrongfully imprisoned in Afghanistan, Cuba, and elsewhere on the basis of flimsy or fabricated evidence, old personal scores, or bounty payments.” But assume there are men being held who have committed violence against Americans. What should be done with them? We have a precedent already. The men accused in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center were tried in American criminal courts. They were given the same protections that ordinary criminals are given, and the government obtained convictions and prison sentences. The same with Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker of the 9/11 attacks. Why not the Guantanamo prisoners? One common response is that some evidence against them is classified. That claim is too easily made and can be used by officials to abuse authority. But in any case, it is a pseudo problem because procedures exist for privately introducing classified evidence at a trial. It’s been done before. That’s not good enough for the preventive-detention advocates, who want to hold prisoners acquitted in court or for whom there is too little evidence to take to trial. But that would be an outrageous abuse of government power. What could be more contrary to the American legal tradition than holding people indefinitely without charge or trial on the suspicion they might commit a crime? The Supreme Court has already ruled that the detainees at Guantanamo must be accorded habeas corpus rights, enabling them to contest their imprisonment. But they have not been given all the same rights as criminal suspects, so the protection is incomplete. Too many people fought and died throughout history to stop governments from engaging in this form of tyranny. Are we ready to discard basic rights just because the people involved (at the moment) are foreigners picked up in a foreign land? Mr. Obama, you can put a stop to this by vowing to veto any preventive-detention bill.

20090220122028AA7iT64	Politics & Government;Elections	America was socialist in the beginning!?	I hear a lot of people accusing Obama of being socialist, well America was already socialist way before Obama was even known. Consider this:      1. 911 is a socialist system, when someone calls 911 it is costing taxpayers money for the ambulance to get to that person.      2. Christianity (which America is founded on) actually supports socialism. In fact, the Bible is completely against captialism.      3. Any aid give to people or countries at the expense of taxpayers money is a trait of socialism. For example, billions of taxpayers dollars have been going to help people in third world countries (which is a good thing) This is socialism.      4. Emergency room policy is socialist. If a person comes in with a gun shot wound the hospital has to treat that whether he/she can pay or not. If the person can't pay then the government pay for the services instead.      America already has socialism laws and policies so why is everyone crying and yelling about Obama socialist? In fact, some socialist policies are actually good.

20090220123342AAUy8sX	Politics & Government;Government	Why are our congressmen throwing lavish events when we're in the middle of difficult times?	These bums need to be THROWN out NOW! I don't care anymore if they're repubs or dems. Kick all their asses out and get some new, less corrupt people in there!      Excerpt:      WASHINGTON — The deepening economic recession hasn't stopped members of Congress from throwing lavish events to raise campaign money for the 2010 election.   This weekend, donors to a political action committee run by Rep. Jeb Hensarling are invited to the Snake River Lodge & Spa near Jackson Hole, Wyo., for a ski outing hosted by the Texas Republican. The minimum donation: $2,500, according to the invitation, which touts opportunities to take sleigh rides to an elk refuge and snowmobile excursions to the Continental Divide.      Skiing also is on the agenda at a fundraiser this weekend in Vail, Colo., for Democrat Ed Perlmutter. Donations range from $2,400 for an individual to $5,000 for a political action committee.      Donors seeking warmer climes could have joined veteran Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii for a "Weekend of Aloha" fundraiser at a resort on Honolulu's Waikiki Beach. Inouye's event, held last weekend, started two days after lawmakers passed President Obama's $787 billion plan aimed at jump-starting the economy. Lawmakers are on a week-long break and return Monday.      "Everyone is tightening their belts, but lawmakers are doing what they have always done: holding fundraisers in exotic locales," said Nancy Watzman, who tracks political fundraising events for the watchdog group Sunlight Foundation. "This is the kind of thing that's out of reach to most people, and it's pretty much hidden from the public."

20090220124204AAzFhd5	Politics & Government;Elections	Brazil asks:  what's wrong with that?	What is wrong with that?   Olavo de Carvalho   Laigle's Forum, July 9, 2008       Brazil gets it.  Brazilian philosopher, Olavo de Carvalho discusses the perplexity of Obama being a candidate for President of The United States:      "Barack Hussein Obama is, in so many aspects, so different from what one normally assumes to be a candidate to the presidency of the U.S. that only by an enormous stretch of the imagination could anyone think that the most significant detail about him is the color of his skin. The motto of his campaign is “change”, but to bring it about he needs not even get elected: he has already changed everything about the electoral ways and customs of the American people, and he has changed it so much for the worse that many decades will be necessary to repair the damage, if indeed that is possible.    For one thing, he is the first candidate without any administrative experience - and with below-minimal political experience - to be accepted by any party to run for such a high office. He also had no military or professional experience, except as an NGO operative. But if you tell that to an Obamaniac, they will invariably answer: “What’s wrong with that?” The natural sense of strangeness about what is truly odd has become anti-natural, offensive and intolerable.   With the possible exception of Brazilian president Lula, whose ignorance was actually praised as a superior form of wisdom, never has so little been demanded of one seeking maximum authority. Even in Third World countries, the bearer of such an insignificant resume would hardly be accepted as a candidate for the top public office. In the Democratic Party and U.S. big media, nobody seems to find anything strange about Obama. Even among supporters of John McCain there is some sort of tacit agreement not to hurt the opponent’s feelings with demands beyond his capacity. Everyone prefers to ask: “What’s wrong with that?”    Furthermore, the candidate lacks not only a resume but even a trustworthy biography. Suggestions that he is a Muslim in disguise pop up every day, but their quantity seems to be inversely proportional to the interest that his adversary and the big media have in clarifying the matter. All seem to want the electorate to accept as utterly normal and unproblematic the hypothesis of voting for an unknown candidate who conceals his origins, even if these somehow connect him to the enemy that is fighting his country in the battlefield, and even if his dedication to covering up his past prompts him to hide his own birth certificate. Evidence of the candidate’s proximity to communist and pro-terrorist organizations is piling up, but raises nary a shred of curiosity among bien-pensants. After all, what’s wrong with that?   Even in the most elementary issue of respect for national symbols - the minimum of etiquette that candidates from all parties have always observed - Obama seems to have acquired the right to mess everything up, without any hint from the establishment that they are offended by it. He listens to the Star-Spangled Banner with his hands on his genitals, and not on his heart, he tampers with the national coat of arms and turns it into a grotesque electoral ad, and, to top it all off, he says that the flag of the country he wishes to represent before the world is “to many people a symbol of violence.” But if you think about it, what’s wrong with that?   Still, it is in violating the law with an innocent face that the candidate displays the kind of absolute trust in his own invulnerability that is so typical of revolutionary sociopaths. Every week new abuses turn up that would normally be enough to destroy the career of any politician or, worse, send him to jail. But Obama seems to be immunized to the consequences of his actions. This week’s latest abuses were: (1) To collect funds for his campaign, he organized a lottery system - which is illegal in all 50 American states. (2) He flies everywhere in an airplane that does not meet the required security standards, and was recently forced to make an emergency landing. But again, the general reaction is the same: “What’s wrong with that?”   Obama is so utterly weird that apparently the only way to attenuate the embarrassment of his presence in the presidential contest is to pretend that he is normal. But the prohibition of finding anything odd is truly a prohibition of the act of understanding, a veto against the formal exercise of intelligence. The readiness to accept this imposition reveals an alarming weakness of character and the almost diabolical effectiveness of the “politically correct” blackmail that produced it."

20090220125431AAytrnF	Politics & Government;Elections	If you are one of the 78% of American Jews who voted for O. did you know this?	February 19, 2009    Obama Reportedly Picks Israel Hater to Lead National Intelligence Council   Sammy Benoit      Here is another tidbit that may surprise the 78% of American Jews who voted for Barack Obama. According to a report in Cable Foreign Policy, Chas W. Freeman Jr. former US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia is about to be named as Chairman of the  National Intelligence Council.         Sources tell The Cable that Chas W. Freeman, Jr., the former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, will become chairman of the National Intelligence Council, the intelligence community's primary big-think shop and the lead body in producing national intelligence estimates.          For those who are not familiar with the former Ambassador, he is a terrorist apologist and a master of bashing Israel. Freeman is a believer of the false premise that all Muslim terrorism stems from Israel's battle with the Palestinians:            "To restore our reputation we must correct these policies. And the problem of terrorism that now bedevils us has its origins in one region the Middle East. To end this terrorism we must address the issues in the region that give rise to it."         "Principal among these is the brutal oppression of the Palestinians by an Israeli occupation that is about to mark its fortieth anniversary and shows no sign of ending. Arab identification with Palestinian suffering, once variable in its intensity, is now total.    ".......For its part, Israel no longer even pretends to seek peace with the Palestinians; it strives instead to pacify them. Palestinian retaliation against this policy is as likely to be directed against Israel's American backers as against Israel itself. Under the circumstances, such retaliation form it takes will have the support or at least the sympathy of most people in the region and many outside it. This makes the long-term escalation of terrorism against the United States a certainty, not a matter of conjecture."      Freeman's premise has been disputed by Yasser Arafat and Hosni Mubarak:         "Osama bin Laden made his explosions and then started talking about the Palestinians. He never talked about them before." - Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak (Newsweek, October 29, 2001)         Even Yasser Arafat told the Sunday Times of London that bin Laden should stop hiding behind the Palestinian cause. Bin Laden "never helped us, he was working in another completely different area and against our interests," Arafat said. (Washington Post, December 16, 2002)

20090220141039AA72gS5	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Charged with Over 80 - Motor Vehicle?	I was recently convicted of driving "over 0.08" BAC. It was at a RIDE program and I have no other prior convictions. I approached the RIDE because in the past I was forced to drive by police officers after drinking significantly more than I had this night and I thought I was ok to drive. I passed all the physical tests, but blew a 0.16 at the station (double the legal limit).      I recently graduated from a 6 year Math/Business double degree program with a concentration in accounting/finance. I now have over $60,000 debt as a result and am having trouble finding a job due to our wonderful economy.      A criminal charge would thus be devastating as I would no longer be able to get a high paying accounting job and would be reduced to a much lower paying unskilled job. There is no way I can make my minimum monthly payments on my debt with such a job and would thus have to claim bankruptcy as there is no money in my family either.      I was wondering if any sort of plea bargaining is possible with my charge. I know that there are minimum penalties and this is an extremely serious charge. I have taken it upon myself to volunteer at MADD, where I will be working with victims of DUI accidents and I was thinking of suggesting some sort of house arrest arrangement. This would give me the opportunity to witness first hand what my actions could have caused and also give me time to think about it while alone in my home. A criminal record will only destroy my life, depress me, and make me angry at the harshness for first time DUI's.      So, given my situation, would talking to the crown beforehand be of any help, or will they just neglect me altogether?      Any help would be greatly appreciated.

One of the guys who is 25 years old has been told he must server a minimum of 28 years. Now in UK terms that is one hell of a long, unusual sentence and only seems to be given to premeditated gun murderers. However, when I have read about similar sentences being handed out in the past they seem to have been given to the person who actually pulled the trigger and not to accomplices.      The fella who oorganizedthe hit received around 35 years minimum (once again harsh by uk standards) and the actual gunman only received around 20 years minimum.      These two fellas who I am assuming just helped in the planning of it are most probably going to die in prison. Is it just me or does this sentence seem a bit harsh considering they only really, I would assume, played a minor role in the killing? I hear about kids getting stabbed to death all the time now here in the UK and their killer receiving around 10 years maximum (get out in 5).       Yet these two lads will be spending the rest of their lives in prison. I am not saying they are innocent or they should not be punished, I just think considering they never actually killed the guy or oorganizedthe hit and also the other sentences handed out in the UK this seems very harsh. Sean Mercer, Rhys Jones's killer, only got 22 years. He actually pulled the trigger killing an eleven year old boy so why did one of these guys get much longer than him?      Some will say what about that poor father-of-three who was chillingly gunned down. Though this is probably irrelevant, I should point out that this man was a well known gangster behind a number of gangland slayings himself so these people who had him killed probably done society a ffavor

I live in Canada if that helps, and I want to be a police officer and was just wondering what it's like, what the training is like, what university courses I can take to help me, If the money is good lol. Basically what the training is like and what I can do to help myself along with this.       Also another little question, how good is family life when you are a police officer? Because I want to be an officer but I don't want to be the dad who never gets to see his kids or wife.
20090220104033AALFAq2	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Speeding Ticket I need help!?	I was driving on I295 over a bridge in VA and was going northbound, the trooper was going south. He turned around at the median where it says authorized vehicles only and came shooting up the lane behind me. He didn't have his lights on or anything. I was on the phone but I got off because I got this strange feeling I was about to be pulled over. As we were getting off the bridge the state trooper got behind me and turned his lights on. He pulled me over and said I was doing 88 in a 60...but I was doing 60 the WHOLE TIME!! How is it that he could clock me from the other side of the road? How do I know he didn't just pull me over because I was on my phone even though it is not illegal in this state, or because I have NY tags? (my mom owns the car, who BTW is a NY Police Officer and said I should have said so when he asked for my registration) I received a ticket from the officer and now I must go to court next month. My question is does he have the right to pull me over? Furthermore he was rude and rather sarcastic which was not appreciated at all. Second question is I looked at the ticket and he marked me down as having VA license plates instead of NY, can my ticket be thrown out for his error?

I'm copyrighting a few songs I've written. I'm sending in the sheet music, not any recordings or audio performances. I would like to leave my dynamic and tempo markings and editorial notes ("More emotional here than in previous verse" or whatever) in the sheet music.      Are the notes, rhythms, and lyrics the only things that are copyrighted? Or are the dynamics and editorial and tempo markings also copyrighted?      I only want to copyright the notes, rhythms and lyrics. Should I leave the notes/markings/dynamics out of the sheet music, to be safe? I'm afraid of someone else putting the same notes and rhythms and lyrics onto a piece of sheet music--with different dynamics markings and notes--and call it their own, and copyrighting it as their own.      Thank you for the advice. I want to be safe.      [This is also posted in Entertainment & Music > Music > Other - Music]

My landlord suddenly turned our parking lot into unauthorized parking.  I live in Townhouse 4plex and we each have a garage and then one stall outside of our garage.  After parking this way for years, one of the tenants backed into a fence and was charged for repair by the landlord.  This tenant was so angry about this, she complained about the parking lot so the landlord changed the parking rules.  Without warning, he posted signs saying only Authorized vehicles can park there.  When i called to ask about it, he said the City of Madison told him he had to do that.  When we called the city, they said that its private parking and they cant control the parking there.  Can he do this?  Is there something that i can do?

20090220132028AAo0Q76	Politics & Government;Politics	Should Obama stop the fear mongering?  Does he have the guts to be an optimist about the economy?	Dear President Obama,       Mr. President, enough with the doomsday talk already. We get it. Things suck. And they’re going to get worse before they get better      You were elected because you are a walking, talking hope machine. Plug that sucker back in and crank it up to ten.         Bradley Schiller, an economics professor at the University of Nevada, straightens out the facts for us: “This fearmongering may be good politics, but it is bad history and bad economics. It is bad history because our current economic woes don’t come close to those of the 1930s. At worst, a comparison to the 1981-82 recession might be appropriate, Consider the job losses that Mr. Obama cites. In the last year, the U.S. economy shed 3.4 million jobs. That’s a grim statistic for sure, but represents just 2.2 percent of the labor force. From November 1981 to October 1982, 2.4 million jobs were lost—fewer in number than today, but the labor force was smaller. So 1981-82 losses totaled 2.2 percent of the labor force, the same as now.       http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-s... 
20090220131700AAEAeWX	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think of Obama's RAT board?	The provision, which attracted virtually no attention in the debate over the 1,073-page stimulus bill, creates something called the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board — the RAT Board, as it’s known by the few insiders who are aware of it. The board would oversee the in-house watchdogs, known as inspectors general, whose job is to independently investigate allegations of wrongdoing at various federal agencies, without fear of interference by political appointees or the White House.      In the name of accountability and transparency, Congress has given the RAT Board the authority to ask “that an inspector general conduct or refrain from conducting an audit or investigation.” If the inspector general doesn’t want to follow the wishes of the RAT Board, he’ll have to write a report explaining his decision to the board, as well as to the head of his agency (from whom he is supposedly independent) and to Congress. In the end, a determined inspector general can probably get his way, but only after jumping through bureaucratic hoops that will inevitably make him hesitate to go forward.

20090220132331AAmxv4l	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	A honest question hoping for honest answers...about Target, Walmart carrying no goods made in USA..?	The real question is, when you walk into any major american store and you start looking for where manufactured merchandise is made, you are hard pressed to find anything made in the USA.  I have actually tried it. I went in home Depot or Lowes, or Target, etc.. I often have to look at 20, 30, 40 items before I find something made in USA.  I dont have any studies to back up what my conclusion is, but I believe its safe to say that at least 85% or more of manufactured goods being sold at american stores are not made in USA and made elsewhere.  And even some of the so called made in USA merchandise is actually just assembled here in USA from parts made overseas.      So....my question is.........how can anyone who is looking at the fact that the american economy is not working very well right now and is talking about how to fix it, and "create jobs" for americans, not address something that is staring us right in the face???.....that we hardly have any manufacturing left in this country like we used to have and that if we actually manufactured our own goods that we consume that it follows that there would be a ton more jobs here at home for americans and that americans would not only have more jobs but also better wages overall?      and furthermore, how can anyone honestly talk of creating jobs for americans, when everywhere you look you see Mexicans speaking spanish boldly with each other doing jobs that just a few years ago americans were doing?         Like I said, I am hoping for some honest answers to an honest question. Facts are facts........

I was arrested April 9th 2005 for a Drug offence (which was not my fault).  Being that this was my first offence, I had no knowledge on how the court system worked.  I trusted the DA (District Attorney) and did exactly what he asked me to do.  He told me to plead guilty to all charges.  He then stated; due to the fact that this is your first offence the judge will go easy on you and give DEJ (Deferred Entry of Justices).  Which meant after 18 months my record would be completely cleared (erased) like it never happened.    Well I then paid my fees and dues attended and completed the classes and pre-trial.   But unfortunately here I am almost 4 years later still struggling with my career as a teacher.  I have already lost 3 jobs regarding my record.  I would get hired and start working when suddenly my background criminal record will show up with an Exemption on it.  Therefore, employers would often find some small (no good reason) to let me go.  And, according to CA State Licensing an Exemption is on your record forever!  I have also had a hard time trying to get a home loan, applying for apts. etc.     I am looking for a way to completely get my record cleaned cleared and free of Exemptions.  I am a PROFESSIONAL HARD WORKING person that really does not deserve to have this on my recording haunting me.      If I knew then that this was going to happen well then I would have fought this case and I guarantee I would have won....

Her mom is a nurse, and that was at age 16, ever since I met her she was 17, theres at least more then twice a year, and me or one of her close friends Nate, Ricol, or someone closer to home but hardly anyone there knows her enough to do that, but we talked her out of it, but now she's 20, knows more then ever when she could do it, what she has to take, where to be, and everything, shes in such bad health, her family doesn't support her, says they hate her and everything like that. .. I hardly see her because I'm still in high school. And she lives all the way across town. She just sent me a text saying that "Just promise me that you won't hate me by the end of the month?" and I'm not going to say anything to anyone yet" and then her and her friend Nate don't talk to anymore. Because its the whole I can't be friends with someone they love kind of thing and she loves him, and so I asked her to please tell me because shes scaring me. You know, and then said if all the **** with nate clears up he'll know what I'm talking about. ... and I didn't answer because I dont want her to get or anything at me you know but if I don't reply she'll get mad anyway so I have no win situation... and I don't know what to do should I call someone to keep her on suicide watch? well beside the whole don't keep her in jail thing, but Help please.

What i'm trying to say is could anyone come along and take him away from my parents and put him into a foster home (sorry if i sound naive, i have no idea about these things) or could he stay with them until they can become his legal guardians.      Thanks very much
20090220133002AApwtcj	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	To Illinois Law Enforcement and Attorneys.....?	What is the definition of "Readily Available", as in "the clip or ammunition for the firearm was readily available".  Does that mean that had to be in constructive possession, I.E. in the attic hiding behind an old dresser drawer but the suspect KNEW where it was, OR does it mean that it was out in the car. Does it mean that it was down at wal-mart and all he had to do was get in his car and go down and buy it (that wal-mart, of course, would have to be in Iowa, across the Mississippi River from where this case is being tried and only a 20 minute drive, where you can buy ammunition without a FOID card)? Is that readily available? How about, he had a computer, and a working credit card, and an internet connection, and he could order it up from a gun supplier somewhere across the country. Does that make it readily available? Opinions are more than welcome, but case law or some examples of convictions won on this phrase would be even better.... thx, john deporter (johndeporter@yahoo.com) Still researching the Sten Gun case......  We finally got out Sten gun clip after 6 days... It appears to be in perfect working order (although we'll never know for sure, but the spring works and the receiver for the 19X9mm shells isn't bent or anything.... does THAT make it readily available, the fact that the clip this defendant would have needed to make it a machine gun was accessible with only a credit card, a computer, an internet connection, and 6 days to spare? I appreciate all of your time, especially you retired (and active) State Troopers out there, you guys seem to know more than half the Lawyers I talk to.

20090220133620AAnvdKa	Politics & Government;Military	Need to choose Marine Corps MOS, narrowed down to two?	There are 2 MOS's available that I am interested in:   02 - intel   and   03 - infantry      I am qualified for both and wanted to get some advise as to how to choose the right one for me.      I currently have no plans after my four years are up in the corps, that is staying in, or persuing any particular career.      I assume both MOS's will open many doors and opportunities for me if I decide to leave the corps after 4 years      I guess my plan for either MOS is as follows:   if i decide to go infantry I would eventually try for 0317 (scout sniper) or stay 0311 (rifleman), both sound good to me.      if I were to go intel, I would eventually try for 0211 (counter intelligence)      Any and all help, advise, stories, etc would be appreciated.
