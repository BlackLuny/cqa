But when you set up a system to tax for education of so many, who almost all speak the same language, and have to add in literally millions whose parents pay less taxes (if any) than their families take in benefits, don't have educated parents, and don't speak the language, not only is it improperly taking from those who actually belong there, it ruins education and other services for the people who are paying for them.<br>  <br>  If there were no subsidies, it would be about people.  Now it's about not enough resources and too great a cost, as well as transfer of subsidies not to the poor people have agreed to help, those born or properly admitted here, but to those who snuck in to get those benefits.  Every parent wants what is best for their children, but the ones who follow the rules, work and pay for that are ENTITLED to it, and have reason to hold a grudge against those who illegally overburden the system.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	I hope so.

I think the media is helping his cause with the constant stories. I have recently talked to people who have listened to him for the first time to see what the "hubbub" was about. It also helps that he expounds true Conservative thought. There are a lot of people who are looking to have their own thoughts confirmed by someone like minded. Rush does that every day.

He is the de facto voice of the American conservative movement and as a liberal, I'm very happy for that. His extreme views are alienating to moderates, creating a political environment which forces moderates to choose between a rationale, educated, and eloquent leader and a pundit hate filled sh%t flinger. It helps his personal cause because his cause is to make money, and he's certainly doing that, however it's counterproductive to the political conservative movement.

It will end in a way, and at an hour, of our choosing." <br>  On Friday, September 14, 2001, President Bush visited Ground Zero.

Rescue workers shouted that they could not hear him. Someone handed him a small American flag and bullhorn. The President spontaneously shouted: "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you.

Then he raised that American flag and rallied a nation. <br>  Education & Employment Training <br>  1.

The Landlord is RESPONSIBLE for providing a safe and habitable rental unit for the tenant. While most landlords and tenants take pride in their home, there could often be disagreements between landlord and tenant. Therefore every state has Landlord Tenant Laws and usually Landlord Tenant Courts to protect both tenant and landlord.<br>  <br>  This was found at <a href="http://www.rentlaw.com/landlord.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rentlaw.com/landlord.htm</a> the landlord tenant law book is also on there and should give you more information to help you.

Generally, in the lease there is a clause about the landlord being responsible for repairs. If you signed an agreement with him and he hasn't fulfilled his end of the bargain, then you can use that as way out (and being the slum lord that he is I'm guessing he will want to avoid going to court). Also, check you state government's website on tenant rights. Depending on the state, there a certain things a landlord must take care of for tenants (concerning living conditions, etc). Know your tenant rights before you talk with him and then be firm. If he still won't let you get out of the lease without a fight, you may be able to report him.

There are many American families and people who struggle to put food on the table, even with jobs, and most of these jobs are the first to be cut off when Companies are laying people off. Now, the whole reason we are in this economic mess, is that conservatives such as President Bush decided to back off, and we have seen the irresponsibility of banking industries, mortgage loaners, and businesses, has been the primary reason for the economic crisis. In order to get out of this, we must pose tighter regulations, because what we did under the Bush Administration did not work, we have seen that when the Government has little control in major corporations, these people will be irresponsible, and will hurt the U.S. significantly.<br>  <br>  P.S. You spoiled brats don't realize how much better we have it then other countries, maybe the government may be a little bit in our faces, but they are only doing it because they don't want to see us get blown up everyday like it happens in other countries.

A budget that for the first time takes into account hidden spending like the war in Iraq which Bush NEVER put into a budget, Obama has.  There are plenty of examples like this.  The government is not inherently corrupt, but the people can be.  Kind of like guns don't kill people....people kill people.  Government is not corrupt, people are corrupt.  I'm all for cutting back our huge military budget, but am also all for paying our service members far more pay than they currently get.  One cannot answer this question really without more specifics.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Republicans completely screw up the government, point at the mess THEY made, and say, "See?

Education, infrastructure, defense, public safety, health care, these are all things that governments in the developed world do very effectively.  We can't get them right HERE, because as soon as conservatives get into power they immediately start trashing every program they don't like.

Republicans want small government, which means no social programs aimed at addressing the inherent inequalities in our nation as a result of abuses of power, yet they want to tell women not to have abortions and they want to tell the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender community that they are somehow less than human by denying them the basic rights that conservatives deem to be so important, specifically, marriage. Large government is a good thing because, if run correctly, it is a unifying and equalizing force. I, for one, believe in equality, even if Republicans don't. Your argument about why government needs to be small boils down to, it can be corrupt. Well, we've seen how corrupt Republicans can be in government and we've seen how corrupt businesses can be as well. WIth no government to regulate business, this nation would never have gotten as far as it has with regard to industrialization as a first world nation.<br>  <br>  Also, as an aside, conservatism is about small FEDERAL government, not small government in general.|`|pRpgbuqiaa	The most important thing is, of course, is the youth. They are tomorrow's senators and statesmen. There are millions of starving or mistreated or neglected or abused or impoverished kids, and we need a bigger government to deal with it. <br>  When the Founding Fathers spoke of a small government, they did NOT have a 300 million population.|`|WvMTmAYPaa	Republicans want government to stay out of peoples lives except when it comes to deciding who can marry who, letting scientists do life saving research,not acknowledge gay american who serve our country, what a women can do with her own body, if cancer and aids patients can use marijuana to ease suffering. So if you really wanted less control for the government you would stay out of people's personal lives and basic freedoms.|`|u93oneUXaa	Why are you generalizing?

Tkb1TKwZaa	It helped him gather support for the black community...though generally that group has voted Democrat ever since Lyndon B. Johnson.  And it did rally the racist people in America against him....though generally that group has voted Republican.  (I'm not saying all republicans are racist or that all Democrats are black, but generally these kinds of people tend to vote for these groups).<br>  <br>  So all in all....<br>  I think that him being black got him *some* votes, but isn't the whole reason why he became president.  He was young, energetic, a great speaker, and (most importantly) the economy crashed so far that people really bought his slogan for "change".|`|p9rbEdpdaa	Yes, that's it. Being black has always been such a big advantage in this county. Maybe we can get the Republicans to run Michael Steal next time and test out your suspicions.

It's modeled on the old British system where the monarch allowed the people to have a voice in governance by electing their own representatives to assemble and pass legislation.

Communism allows no private property.  Everything is held in common.  Socialism does not necessarily proscribe private property but it does specify common (government) ownership of the "means of production and distribution."  Less severe forms call for just government control of industry.<br>  <br>  Basically, the more government control, and less individual control we have over our lives the more "socialized" we are.  Communism puts everything under government ownership and control.

56ee2b80889254372942af362f9b659daa	The constitution has been in effect since March 4, 1789.  When it was first used the electoral college chose the number one vote getter as president.  At that time the number two vote getter was elected as vice president.  Article II spells out the rules for our executive branch of government but other amendments also apply to presidential elections.  When debating the constitution you can't take any short cuts.  You have to read it.  You have to assume your opponent did.  Who ever studies it least will have less accuracy of statements in a debate and show less confidence as well.<br>  <br>  If you look at article 2 of the U S Constitution you can see that the states are supposed to choose electors to represent their state at the electoral college for the purpose of choosing (electing) a president for the union. This means that the states elect the president not the people. It also says in article 2 that the method for selecting electors is left to each individual state. This means that it isn't necessary for the states or for the union to hold a presidential election where people vote. The president represents the union and is elected by the states, People are represented in the legislative branch of government. The president is not supposed to represent the people. In fact if there were to be a conflict of interest between the union and the people it is the presidents job to represent the union, the welfare of the union, the defense of the nation and the fiscal health of the nation. The state governments are democracies. The federal government is a republic. A republic doesn't require one man one vote but can elect the chief of state by other than a popular vote. The electors meet at their respective state capitols and the majority rules. Who ever wins the vote is how the state votes for the president. That is winner takes all. The president and vice president are our only offices filled by this method. Everyone who represents people is elected by a direct vote of those people. That is why we have a type of republic for the federal government. If you dispute that we are a republic repeat the pledge of allegiance.|`|Xn0Lh8T3aa	The process is as old as the Constitution and is described in Article II Section 1 and was modified slightly by Amendment 12.<br>  <br>  In order to get each of the attending states delegations to agree to form a union of states with a federal government, the Framers of the Constitution agreed to allow the President to be elected by the states while members of Congress would be elected by the people with the privilege to vote as determined by their respective states.<br>  <br>  The idea behind it was to try and come up with a process that would ensure the person elected to the office of President of the United States would have the approval of the majority of states in the union of states in hopes that by a majority approval, the union would survive.<br>  <br>  As a backup plan, if the states Electors could not settle the question of who sits in the office, the states through their elected congressional representatives, would attempt to agree on who should be President of all the states.<br>  <br>  Populations of the states weight the Electoral College but if the election takes place in Congress, all the states are exactly equal with the biggest and the smallest populated states having the same power to elect… exactly 1 vote per state.  The "magic number" thus drops from 270 to 26.<br>  <br>  In 1787, the biggest state by population was only about 7 times larger than the smallest. Today that ratio is about 100 to 1. In 1787, it was mathematically impossible to elect a President without a majority of states approval. Today, if the 11 most populated states were to vote as a block, those 11 states could elect the President for all 50 states. If that were to happen consistently, some states, perhaps a majority of states would secede and form another government.|`|UgOx2Gxiaa	It was A simple way of doing the Elections Like before the PONY EXPRESS..<br>  <br>  I believe it is Well Out Dated & Needs to be <br>  <br>  Abolished once & for all<br>  <br>  It is a JOKE|`|t8JlnuqFaa	doyourownhomework.com|`|Alkn6IJYaa	It is not exaclty the electoral college system which is so bad, it is:<br>  <br>  1) Electors are not apportioned exactly to the population because a state always gets at least 1 Senator and 1 congressman (or two, can't remember).<br>  <br>  2) We have winner take all.<br>  <br>  It might be possible to appoint enough electors that they could be apportioned without bias among the states. For example, pick the lowest population state, make that 1 elector for how many millions of people. Suppose half a million are in wyoming, so they get one, then for every half million you get one elector. Then California would have 72 (36 mill pop). Currently, Wyoming has 3 electors and California has 55.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	1)  Electoral college was not used, or even conceived of before the Constitution of 1789.  Washington was elected in 1789. First electoral college was held to elect George Washington in 1789.<br>  <br>  2) The writers of the constitution hated democracy.  They wanted a government of rich white males to protect them from socialists and communists.  So they rigged the government so that only rich people could ever be part of the national government.<br>  <br>  3) So they set up a system of indirect election of US senators ( changed by 17th amendment) and the president.<br>  <br>  4) That way we idiot socialists would need a majority in several states and not just an overall majority.<br>  <br>  5) Pro or con depends on your desire for more or less elitist ( of the rich by the rich for the rich) representation in your national government.

Obama is partially responsible because congress is responsible and Obama was in Congress at the time.<br>  <br>  The economy started to fail as a result of the banking industry failures.  Mainly because banks were pressured into giving loans to people who could not afford them.  The Bush administration even warned congress of this.  The Democrats who controlled congress at the time, did not want to listen to Bush.  They despised him.  They claimed the banking industry (specifically Freedie Mac and Fannie Mae) was just fine.<br>  <br>  We now all know they were dead wrong.

The opposition the Canadians faced was stronger than that of any other beach save Omaha. That was an accomplishment in which the whole nation could take considerable pride.” - John Keegan, British historian.<br>  <br>  The Canadian achievements on D-Day were remarkable. By the end of the day the 3rd Canadian Division was well established on its intermediate objectives, and had progressed further inland than any of the Allies. Although short of the planned final D-day objectives the Canadians had broken through the ’Atlantic Wall’ and smashed the first line of German defences.<br>   <br>  Ahead lay eleven more months of bitter fighting. In June the Canadians would fight and overcome the brutal killing machine of the 12th SS. They would stubbornly hold and defend their positions against the vicious German counter-attacks.

I think the real purpose all along was to give police more power to question people with no cause, to do searches and seizures without due  process, to break down doors, etc.<br>  <br>  The FBI and police have plain-clothes agents walking the streets of inner cities, selling drugs who whoever will buy them, then arresting them.  The CIA uses drugs to finance covert operations and illegal wars in other countries.<br>  <br>  Even if the War on Drugs is successful, it is self-defeating.

tPvjd8qqaa	You don't say how it was that the officer determined your speed.  From the description of the incident we'll infer that it was a speed measuring device, i.e. radar or lidar. <br>  All officers using a speed measuring device must receive training in their use.  They have to take a test and pass it before using them.   <br>  To properly use radar an officer has to "check" the radar calibration and make sure that it is working properly before and after it is used to cite someone.  <br>  Next when he is using it, the training dictates that the officer make a visual estimation of a "violators" speed and then apply the speed measuring device to confirm the visual estimate.  <br>  The speed measuring device should, if radar, will have an audible tone associated with the radar reading.  It should be clear and uninterrupted.  <br>  In order to determine if you can get the ticket dismissed, you will have to see the officer's notes or report that he wrote.  If all of the elements are there then you probably are toast.  If not, you have a chance.  <br>  My favorite question to an officer is whether or not he has read the speed measuring device's operating manual.  All of the officer's I have trained were told to read them.  Only they know if they did or not.|`|uIAHkm0Naa	trooper-doesnt the cop have to show in court where he clocked him speeding? and doesnt he have to show record of the last time he got the radar calibrated?|`|AA11494150	It will be very difficult for you to produce an evidence you were not speeding, other than your testimony.

Q5OEbSBcaa	Unfortunately, most states have a strong presumption in favor of birth parents for custody, so unless it can be demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that mother is an unfit parent (meaning that being with her will endanger the child's welfare), or that the mother has voluntarily relinquished her rights as a parent, you've got an uphill battle.  Now, the laws of your state may be very different than that, which is why I suggest you do the following:<br>  <br>  Contact the bar association of the nearest large city and ask for a referral to a family lawyer.  You love your nephew, so a few hundred dollars and a few hours of your time is worth it to talk to someone and get a hands-on assessment of what's really going on.|`|FH6o70RFaa	If you have been taking care of him since he was a baby then I do not see why the mother wouldn't let you see the kid but really you have rights but consider the fact that the mother may accually turned a new leaf and is actualy able to care for the boy now... and then you should get the same visitation rights as my great aunt and uncle did which was when ever i decided to vistit|`|VpXrsxGGaa	if you dont have legal custody then no <br>  if you do then you can decide if he goes back and if she can see him|`|s1tfLnDXaa	It depends on how the mother is with her kid.

Bush used Kaynesian spending (Trillions of Dollars were spent before he ever considered a "bailout," or any directly recession driven spending, spending which was continual throughout his 8 years) just to keep off the impending and inevitable collapse of the American economy, which will now collapse no matter what we do. Just as when Rome collapsed, every culture has it's hayday, then it's fall.<br>  <br>  2. Bush's borrow and spend Republicanism actually injured the economy, and Obama will do one of three things: 1. Continue to borrow and spend, making things worse, 2. Stablize the economy where we citizens will have to just get used to the new paradigm, and less wealth, or 3. be able to usher in a new Golden Age, much like we saw in the 50s and 60s in the US. <br>  <br>  We'll see.

Look at wars in the past. WW2 was a good example. Our grandparents, whether they agreed or not, rolled up their sleeves and went to work in B-17 factories. The economy, though rationed, prospered and unemployment was virtually non existent.<br>  Where are the huge factories full of workers for the F-22's? the M1A Tanks? the ammo and grenade factories? They don't exist. Why? 'Cause average Joe Q. American would NEVER take such menial labor! He's waiting for the $500k a year w/ company car and free house job to come calling. He's never buy war bonds 'cause it's against his delicate sensibilities, and would NEVER ration because that would mean that he wouldn't get his 30 bags of chips for the superbowl! <br>  Point is past generations put aside differences for the common good.

P4vRH5Ufaa	Don't get me wrong man, I can't stand Obama, or his media coverage.  However bad talking Muslims just makes all of us look bad.  A person really can't judge an entire religion based solely on some quack fanatics.  After all we have things such as the Spanish inquisition in Christian history.  Does that mean that all Christians torture and kill one another?  What about the fact that almost every christian holiday has its roots in pagan rituals?  Easter, Christmas, weddings, funerals? all of them very pagan.  Do all Buddhist monks set themselves ablaze to make a point? Does every Mormon man have seven wives?  I don't agree at all with your attack on Islam.   However you do have the right to speak your mind and any person who reports a comment as offensive, is an oversensitive, constitution bashing, socialist with a compulsive urge to control others...

024e057726e56ac8f27fea7f5379e549aa	While I am not quite in siege mentality yet, I have become a frequent shopper at dollar stores and bulk groceries for many of my weekly needs and cleaning supplies. Unfortunately, I have allowed by cats, poultry and  horse to expect a certain standard that I cannot easily downgrade. So they pretty much get the usual daily fair. I have taken to using the fireplace, when I can get permission from my local fascist government to allow me to burn my own wood on my own land. So the gas company is now only ripping me off for a fraction of the cost that it takes to heat hot water only. While I still will get new clothing as needed, it has been pretty much just new socks and briefs so far this winter. Wow ! I felt so lucky to splurge for some boxer-briefs! ha-ha I am embarrassed to admit I have not been as timely as I should be dumping all my retirement stocks and re-investing in precious metal.

We never bought into the housing market because we thought the prices were ridiculous for a house in our area and we simply couldn't afford it.  I never trusted the sub-prime loans because I worked in the Mortgage banking industry for a few years and learned enough about housing loans to make me smart enough not to believe the story behind these fraudulous loans. But I can see why so many didn't know what they were doing with these loans and thought they could buy a home when told all the lies by the lenders who would do anything to sell them the loan. I have alot of empathy for them.<br>  So we are going on alot of hikes in the local hills and Mountains rather than going to Europe this year. Neither of our jobs are that secure however.<br>  <br>  I honestly don't think people realize the truth of this economy.  We haven't hit bottom yet, nor will we for a while.

IxKzCfnSaa	In the highly unlikely event that NK would attack the South, it would be due to famine or in the event of KJI's death. KJI's death may cause an uproar in who would take over the country. Neither one of KJI's sons would be able (one I believe is a schizophrenic and the other a homosexual)  to take over leaving military leaders and top political advisors. I am sure that these leaders would be assassinating each other due to the crazy ways of NK and it would cause the country to collapse thus creating even bigger problems for the worst country in the world. This would possibly cause them to A. become one with the South or B. attack the South with poor leadership and terrible military strategy.

Example... The UAW killed the auto industry because they keep'd bitching for more and more (when their jobs are non-skilled, a retard could do what they do better) and caused the American cars to cost so much, that people started to buy foreign... The UAW has had the best saleries in the nation for years and what they do is no harder then a McDonalds worker.

Regardless who or what party is or was in power, they spend as much as they can for fulfilling their goals of buying votes and please the voters and definitely for their political convenience. What the world political leaders should do are as followings.<br>  1) Destroy the global stock markets entirely and prevent any bull market occurs in the next ten years. To lower the actual and nominal values of at least 70% lessen of the total current market values.<br>  2) It is necessary to control the real estate prices and heavy transactions that created so many bubbles affected many walks of life in Hong Kong, UK, and the US. It is necessary to amend new rent control laws in UK, Hong Kong, US, for not allowing at least a bi-annual rental contract completed to follow by an increase rent of not more than 3%-5%. This can solve the global problem of credit crunch created by financial personnel in banks, real estate development, and big spending government just like the above-mentioned.<br>  3) Introduce the more strict executive caps in US, UK, and Hong Kong. Obama has done a good job for the cap of reduced the former annual income of known and bailed out executives from US 11 million dollars to one half a million US/year. Likewise the god damned Hong Kong government must start to amend a mass cut to its useless but the highest paid officials and top ranking civil servant of at least 40% to 60% average wages cut. The lower and middle ranks are deserved a wage cut cut from 6% to 20%. The UK needs to do the same as what I suggested to the facist government of Hong Kong. It has raised the eyebrows of the many in London for the overpaid failure of Sir. Fred Goodwin as the bank executive.

You can't see how much you are helping Obama cause what you are doing is the opposite of what you want to do. 85% of the country is supporting Obama. So of course Pepsi would want to. I drink water but I would buy Pepsi if I had a party so maybe that is what the while house does but I buy all kinds of products what is your point. Do you think because he doesn't use every product that people shouldn't support him.

Our economy needs money circulating to survive. obama is giving us a transfusion & if we could get people like you to vote for what is good for you & not the con artist republicans our country is going to be very rich.

It takes away the incentive for people to become successful. This country was built on the premise that we have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

An agent of change so large and powerful as the government COULD track each of the corrupted processes that occurred, but to reveal what was discovered would also make clear what alternative policy changes are possible and which are most needed.  The administration, having its own agenda for change, does not want competing ideas to be discussed, and so, will not be letting the public in on what actually happened.  Well-informed economists have their educated suspicions, and so they are discussing in terms reflecting in-depth knowledge of the flows of money (and credit), but most of the mass media reporters do not understand, and so the information and discussion are confined to the financial news and financial publications.  The mass media are only qualified to broadcast the administration's proclamations, which are often off-purpose.  As one White House advisor revealed, the administration is making full use of the crisis for its own purposes, NOT to demonstrate its mastery of economic affairs.  The administration is being "transparent" in its actions, but NOT in its purposes and goals.  The administration is clearly in charge, but it is not solving the crisis:  it appears to be prolonging it by neglect of solutions.

mbvpWNMeaa	Human rights are universal.  However it is sometimes true that cultural bias among human rights groups can lead to incidents of cultural repression in the name of human rights.  That being said, anyone who hides behind tradition to abuse his or her fellow human beings is a coward and a tyrant.  It is one thing to say that it is a cultural tradition that men and women have a certain division of labor.  It is quite another to say that men can hold women against their will, beat them and cut off important part of their bodies because its "their culture."  <br>  <br>  Slavery was a cultural norm in the United States for a very long time, but that didn't make it any more right for us than for any other culture and countries like England andFrance were absolutely right to stay on our case about it.  If a culture can only define its self by such atrocious behavior, it is not worth preserving in its present form but needs to evolve and change.|`|t6JnsydGaa	different cultures produce different people with different belief and value definition. culture is a part of ultimate human rights. but today only western value for human rights is the one media means. Actually nothing is universal. human right should be and always be culturally oriented, and tailored for cultural beliefs. being universal is a denial for individual and cultural differences. <br>  <br>  unfortunately there are so many people who are so indifferent to different beliefs, customs, history and values with their own  human right bias -- one particular cultural belief. they are not real human right supporters, but ignorant fools or wicket political plotters.|`|f1c1c8dafe8cc85d8807ccbdff4a484baa	Human rights are a commodity item that are determined by capitalism and the ability of the purchasing sector to ignore, or blame others for the cost of their goods.  <br>  <br>  No pair of Nike's ever got cheaper with child labor.

It really depends on whether you're a hard core relativist or not. <br>  <br>  If I'm a relativist, I truly believe that right and wrong is determined by the culture in question, not any particular set of rights and wrongs, so to speak. Since things are arbitrary anyway, it would be cultural imperialism to force my views of right and wrong on someone else.<br>  <br>  Now, here's my perspective: believing that human life has inherent value and showing compassion for our fellow man makes for a happier society than being indifferent to the value of human life and happiness.  Religion aside, we're a species that requires a social structure to survive. We care about morals because we are always indebted to each other for our survival. If we don't treat each other well, it won't work. To make sure that the individuals have a decent standard of living, we have to make some moral decisions. Otherwise, might makes right. <br>  <br>  Also, if you're a moral relativist, there's always going to be someone who's more than willing to force their views on you. Better to form your own opinions, live by them, and defend them than bowing to the whim of those who don't have your best interests at heart. <br>  <br>  A good example of that is the situation with the Muslims in France. Muslims aren't relativists. They want to force their views on everyone. In some parts of France and the UK they're pushing for sharia law. Franc and the UK are populated with many people who are relativists. Guess who's ideologies are going to get passed on to the next generation? (A hint: it isn't that of the relativists.) <br>  <br>  Eclectic crab: I've heard liberals say that we should deny people aid so that they die off and help the overpopulation problem. Don't act like conservatives are all jerks. There are Democrats who are scary too.|`|AA12119076	Human rights are what ever the collective agree upon. I would do a search at the UN web site.
zlmnfFpYaa	No.  And for the dolts portraying the American participants as terrorists, there is a quantum difference between forces openly engaging the opposite side's military and terrorism.  Guerrilla warfare is not terrorism, it's a tactic.  The Boston Tea Party was an act of protest, not terrorism.  If any side committed terrorist acts in the Revolutionary War, it was the British, especially in the Southern campaign when they raped and pillaged their way through the Carolinas.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Scott, if that was your intent, I apologize.  Samsa, it is most definitely not playing with semantics.  The Boston Tea Party was a classic act of civil disobedience, one of the first in fact.  No one was hurt.  No one was killed.  No one was beheaded.  Terrorism, by definition, involves violence or at least the threat of violence, against non-involved entities, creating an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.  Calling the Tea Party an act of terrorism would mean that nearly every civil disobedience action and protest would also fall into that category, including but not necessarily limited to the entire Civil Rights movement, Gandhi's actions, the Orange Revolution, and all of the anti-war protests against Vietnam and Iraq.<br>  <br>  I don't think you want to go there.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	The Boston Tea Party was an act of terrorism.  Whether that incident was morally defensible is a matter of personal opinion, the same as every other act of terrorism.<br>  <br>  To call it an "act of protest" instead of terrorism is playing with semantics.  Otherwise, you could say that Timothy McVeigh's bombing was just an "act of protest".|`|AA11450062	Yes, the British and the Republicans that use to turn in the founding fathers to the British labeled our creators of the United States terrorist to the British rule. The Boston Tea Party today would fall under terrorism under the Patriot Act|`|rdMGWgZBaa	The term "terrorism" means creating horror and violonce to get what you want. It can never be defensible in any way. Fighting for what you want is something else.|`|9tkea8QTaa	for the people commiting the act it always is and they never think its terrorism. for the victims its never|`|f1c1c8dafe8cc85d8807ccbdff4a484baa	The American colonists were using guerilla warfare and considered terrorists by the British.<br>  <br>  It's all perspective.|`|AA11376640	The US does it on a daily basis, therefore it must be!|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Don't be afraid. Study the problem and solve it.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	By definition, terrorists intentionally target civilians and generally have no desire to change the current system, they want to destroy it. Think about the 911 attack: they targeted a landmark filled with normal business men and women in the heart of a major city. They also targeted the Pentagon.  Many of the people who work there are civilians as well. My dad works on contract for the government, and he was supposed to be there when the attack happened. Luckily he wasn't because a meeting got pushed back a few days.  He's never been in the military. Should he have died just because someone arbitrarily decided that they hate what America stands for? <br>  <br>  So no, terrorism is never morally defensible.  In war, sometimes there were be unintentional civilian casualties.  A moral country tries to avoid killing civilians. Therefore, terrorism is immoral.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	Two hundred and thirty five years ago, a bunch of people who were fed up with the way they were treated by the Brittish govenment stormed a boat and threw all its goods into the Boston Harbor. This event, known as the Boston Tea Party, could be construed as a terrorist act. No one died (as far as I know), but subsequent actions by the colonies did result in deaths.<br>  <br>  Assaulting innocent civilians is not acceptable though. Any violent action should be a last resort, and should be directed at those responsible for the unresolved issue, only after lengthy attempts to resolve those issues peacefully.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Depends on your definition of terrorism.<br>  <br>  On 911, there were 4 planes involved.  Two went into the WTC, that is terrorism, because it was a direct attack on a civilian target.  Plane 3 went into the Pentagon, which is a military target, and attacks on enemy military targets are not terrorist.<br>  <br>  The final plane was intended (according to some stories) to hit the White House.  Again, that is a legitimate military target, so not terrorism.<br>  <br>  True terrorism, meaning strikes against civilian targets intended purely to create chaos, death, and 'terror' is not justifiable.  Other forms of what we often label 'terrorism', namely irregular combatants attacking military or political targets, are justifiable as legitimate forms of self defense.  USS Cole, the Marine Barracks in Beirut, other embassy attacks, all those are legitimate and thus justifiable.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	No.<br>  <br>  Because it doesn't work.<br>  <br>  The USS Cole<br>  <br>  Beiruit bombing.<br>  <br>  9.11<br>  <br>  And we're still in Saudi Arabia and not at Muslim nation.<br>  <br>  Oklahoma City<br>  <br>  And our government is still here.<br>  <br>  It's counter-productive because it only mobilizes resources and shifts public opinion against the terrorist's position, whether it has any merit or not.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	NO - NEVER

Luckily, my wife and I BOTH had to do the same commute, so at least there were two of us in the car.  But at some point we decided that living far from work (in a much cheaper home, of course, like many in that situation) was not the best solution.

JDAbWnJraa	Would seem to me, in my inexpert opinion, that the only way for a firearm to discharge would be for the trigger to be accidentally pulled, or for the weapon to be jarred enough to cause the firing pin to release or otherwise strike the primer on the cartridge. So if something snagged, or fell against the trigger as he reached, sure it can happen. I rule out a jarring force because, having served in the military and in combat, I have fallen against, off of and around all sorts of stuff with my weapon in hand and never had it discharge. We did, however, have one soldier who let his weapon drop to his side, while talking with another soldier, and as the butt stock struck the ground, it discharged and killed him. So IT CAN happen.<br>  <br>  My guess is that the life insurance companies don't pay out on a suicide, so it had to be an accident, right?|`|b17592fed8d273ceda591464162c5148aa	if you are crazy enough to carry a loaded AK47 beside your bed nothing would surprise me.

What was he paranoid of...invasion by a country?|`|C62F31Dwaa	Is this what really occupies your thoughts?|`|AA11284831	The autopsy and forensic analysis of the weapon will reveal the likelihood of it being an accident or something more sinister.<br>  <br>  An AK isn't the kind of thing that one leaves on the typical nightstand so that sounds fishy from the start.  An AK 47 is just shy of 3 feet long and it's about 2 feet from muzzle to trigger so do the math yourself.  The trigger guard is well-designed against accidental activation of the trigger and the weapon itself is not known for accidental discharges unless something hits the trigger.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	First gun+booze = bad day.<br>  Second a night stand that's big enough to have an AK47 on it is like as big as a dinner table.. an AK is almost 3 feet in length.<br>  I don't know how you would get a 3 foot long weapon to aim at your own head.. but then booze makes lots o' things possible.. it could have been an discharge or something. AKs aren't such great weapons, they have flimsy parts.<br>  I don't want to sound mean but I just get a kick out of, "I was reaching for my ice cream and shot myself in the head with an AK47."|`|l4pVsxoraa	Well, it could happen.  Most "AK-47"s available today are cheap knock offs of the original good quality 47, built with cheap parts and poor craftsmanship.  If your sisters' b in L managed to give a loaded AK a good jolt it could easily discharge.  <br>  <br>  Wrong place, wrong time, no more head.|`|F5GyrdQfaa	If he was paranoid, then he likely kept the weapon not just loaded, but ready to fire (cocked, safety off). This does make it likely it was an accident, though how it hit his face if he was reaching for ice cream on the nightstand is unclear.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	Accidental shootings are common especially when the individual is drunk. One has to be aware of ones weapon, and that is compromised with booze.|`|VeWD8Io2aa	I see booze, improper storage of a weapon and not paying attention. Normally I'd say this is easy, but I clicked on this one thinking "you can't accidentally shoot yourself in the head w/ an AK!" An AK47 is generally 16+ or - depending model inches with about 10 of those from muzzle to trigger. this means that you would have to knowingly extend your arm toward the trigger to discharge the weapon. We had a case where a guy shot himself in the shoulder with a rifle equipped w/ a 16" barrel. He said that it was an accident but we proved that the only way it could have happened was for him to put the muzzle into his shoulder and reach down to the rigger. A completely conscious decision with anyone knowing that the weapon could cause injury if used in this manner. We proved he did it purposely(funny, but he was due to deploy the next week) and he eventually admitted to it.<br>  I have no idea as to the condition of the weapon(i.e. worn parts)but I would reccommend that the police run ballistics and other tests. I don't buy the accident story, but it is plausible.<br>  Not to be rude, but are your sister and him having a troubled marriage right now?

If her name is on the lease, then you have a legal problem and will have to take legal steps to have her removed.  If he does not have just cause for her removal (although not paying any rent is just cause), then he may not be able to get her out, and may find he himself will have to relocate.  But as long as her name is not on the lease, and she has not paid any rent, he can simply put her out.|`|zmmP52P3aa	he needs to give her a notarized eviction notice.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Tell her to leave in front of witness.

After the first six months, you cannot operate a motor vehicle with more than three passengers who are under 19 years old and who are not members of your immediate family.<br>  <br>  Everyone in the vehicle must wear seat belts and obey the curfew (1:00 a.m. - 5:00 a.m.).

It sounds tough, but if she honestly leaves you no choice it is an option.<br>  <br>  sounds honestly like a job for Steve Wilkos|`|RjUhISEIaa	Okay, I understand kicking her a$$ out of the house by why your grandson? You really want to put him into a situation where he is going to be subjected to what you say she is doing? Think this part of the issue thru very, very carefully for he is not to blame for her ways.<br>  <br>  How can you throw her out? Tell her, in writing, she has 30 days to leave. Then on the 31st day move her stuff to the curb and change the locks on the doors. You then are covered for you gave her notice and you then evicted her from the premises.<br>  <br>  But remember...please...you truly must think about your grandson before you do this.<br>  <br>  ADDED NOTE: you do not need to take her to court to evict her from the property if there is no lease involved. She is a child of yours and you can kick her out tomorrow if you really wanted to and nothing could be done about it. But giving her the 30 day notice is the only humane thing to do since there is a child involved. <br>  <br>  Also, you could file for custody of the child and spend thousands upon thousands and be awarded the child. However, if you are certain of the charges you made against her you could also call in CPS, let them know what you are going to do and have them place the child in a foster home. Hopefully you would also tell CPS that you are willing to be foster parents for the child for he is definitely going to need family around him.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	Ok - first of all, your wife needs to be the one to kick her out. It's her daughter, and she's the one that has to do it. I assume she wants to kick her daughter out too, otherwise you should be asking for a divorce lawyer instead.<br>  <br>  The way to do it is to give her notice, and not back down. Legal notice must be served. Protect your valuables, she may steal stuff when she finds out she'll be on her own.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.  There's an idea above that's a good one.

If she is a drug user then she needs professional help, not being kicked onto the streets (which would probably mean she resorts to crime a lot more to feed her addiction).<br>  <br>  Is she a tenant? In which case you would have to adhere to her contract. If not, you can just ask her to leave.

During this time, be sure to watch your possessions as they may "disappear".|`|rsE1m7aOaa	this girl sounds really unmotivated, kick her *** out and keep her kid, see if you can take legal custody over the child because she sure as hell doesnt give a shlt about the kid|`|7uznrLBXaa	First, understand that eviction is a legal process that protects *tenants.*  If she is not a tenant, she cannot be evicted.  You can ask her to leave, or you can have her arrested for trespassing.  You cannot have her evicted.  <br>  <br>  However, she will take her toddler with her.  And a homeless drug user will not take the child anywhere good.  Your decision will ultimately hinge on how much you care for the toddler.  You can kick her out with the child, or you can get social services involved, or you can seek custody yourself.  <br>  <br>  I don't want to sound rude, but the child is only 3.  I'm sure he does have "issues," as you say - at least partially due to his mother and father.  But with quality parenting - and the professional help he needs  - surely he can thrive!<br>  <br>  Contact your local bar association and ask for a referral to a family law attorney.   Most attorneys do pro bono work.  You can also contact a local law school and ask if they have a family law clinic.|`|XD42367paa	If drugs are involved, I'd encourage your wife to petition the court for legal guardianship of the child and then kick mom's hiney out. <br>  <br>  Look, you can't in good conscience kick out her three year old kid. Even if you kick out his mother, a decent human being should not make that kid suffer his mother and father's actions if they can help it. I am sure you have no desire to raise another kid, however, you married the lady you married, and she has this grandson to see to. If you can't entertain this as a possibility, then maybe you need to think about walking. <br>  <br>  And I know where you are on it. My husband has a son who got a woman preggo and she now has his 2 year old twins. She can't raise them, he doesn't want them. I told my husband that those boys need a home and if need be, we will raise them here. There is no way I could let some kid get a raw deal if there is some way I can stop it from happening. <br>  <br>  If you have it in you, then step up. If not, be honest and walk away now. <br>  <br>  EDIT- You don't want custody? Then walk. You are not legally responsible and will not be held as such.

JDAbWnJraa	Having served 6 1/2 years active duty Army Airborne (Infantry), 2 combat tours and then 6 years in the Army Reserves (Drill Instructor), I will give you these little pearls to consider carefully. Whether the Reserves, or the Guard, it is a great way to learn a life skill that could potentially improve your quality of life in the civilian world. Now that the flowery recruiter type stuff is out of the way, let's cut to the chase...<br>  <br>  Our nation is at war right now and the Reserve forces and National Guard troops are being activated and deployed in to combat zones regularly. So, this choice can very well end you up in Iraq, or Afghanistan. Now, when I served on active duty, we ate, slept and **** fighting 24/7. When my unit dropped in to the suck at any time, we were ready and I was surrounded by hardcore professionals which increases your chances for survival exponentially. Not to knock the Reserves or the Guard soldiers in any way, but they are part timers man and that is the plain truth. Yeah, you may have a couple of active service vets in a reserve or guard unit, but that only helps THEM when the bullets fly. Bank clerks and shelf stockers from the Home Depot in town are not gonna react and respond in situations the same as a squad or platoon of guys who have done this stuff together as a team for a long time. <br>  <br>  So you wanna serve your country and that is awesome. I just always hated when we had a guy in the unit crying about how he only joined for the college fund and never thought he would actually end up in a firefight. So all I ask is that you know what you're asking for before you raise your right hand. Believe me, it isn't an easy way out of ANY situation and the pay sucks anyhow. Those that serve, serve because of a higher calling inside of them.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	I've enjoyed being in the Guard for almost nine years.  (Two tours in Iraq) and lots of other flexible active duty missions that have been good for me when I needed full time work.

Good luck.|`|6TVSeCnpaa	I recently joined the NG partially cos of the same reason and also work experience and stuff. <br>  first of all u gotta talk to a recuiter then u take the asvab, meps the ur offically a member.

The reserves do mostly only federal missions whereas the Guard will be called to do state as well as Federalmissions.  Right now the Guard is being activated alot to go overseas to help out the regular Army.  It also depends on what kind of job you get into.The best way is to talk to a recruiter and find out what they have to offer you. Take the ASVAB test and find out what you qualify for and then go from there.|`|7f1TfskEaa	I was in a Reserve Transportation Brigade and we had a rail unit under us.  Most of the rail units are in the National Guard.  From personal experience, there are a lot of variations in National Guard units.  You have a specific unit you are looking at (rail).  Visit the unit and talk to them.  They should be willing to have to come by during one of their weekend drills to see what they do and meet some of the people.<br>  <br>  It used to be  "National Guard, it's not just a job...it's a car payment."<br>  Now it's "The difference between a reservist and active duty is that the reservist has a part-time hobby called a civilian job."<br>  <br>  You may find that the National Guard/Reserve unit you join will provide good contacts for civilian jobs.  Iraq was doing a lot of work on their rail lines while I was over there.  It might be possible for you to turn your background into a decent contractor position advising the State Dept. in Iraq.

From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.---------------------------...<br>  In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.---------------------------...<br>  Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.---------------------------...<br>  China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated----------------------------...<br>  Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.---------------------------...<br>  Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.------------------------<br>  Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million educated' people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.---------------------------...<br>  Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million.------------------------------<br>  It has now been 12 months since gun owners in Australia were forced by new law to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by their own government, a program costing Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars.The first year results are now in:<br>  List of 7 items:<br>  Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2 percent<br>  Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6 percent<br>  Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent)!In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up 300 percent.<br>  Note that while the law-abiding citizens turned them in, the criminals did not, and criminals still possess their guns!<br>  While figures over the previous 25 years showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms, this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months, since criminals now are guaranteed that their prey is unarmed.<br>  There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults of the ELDERLY. <br>  Australian politicians are at a loss to explain how public safety has decreased, after such monumental effort, and expense was expended in successfully ridding Australian society of guns.<br>   The Australian experience and the other historical facts above prove it. <br>  You won't see this datum on the US evening news, or hear politicians disseminating this information.Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws adversely affect only the law-abiding citizens.Take note my fellow Americans, before it's too late!

The surge (that all the democrats said would fail) was a success and pretty much eliminated most of the insurgents in Iraq.<br>  <br>  The reason you see nothing on Afghanistan is it's winter time and the fighters usually go home for the winter and the fighting resumes in the spring.

Bush who I believe is not intelligent enough to have made this decision was just a puppet - but in saying that he was a willing participant. Between them they have made this world a far unhappier dangerous place as well as causing so many people to live in fear and insecurity even in the west - as for Blair I find it ironic that he is now The middle east peace envoy.  Doh!!  For those who don't agree I suggest you look into the history of the USA and Britain and see exactly why we are so hated by many in the middle east.

If that information was false, that's not his fault. Also, the facts are that congress issued a declaration of war against Iraq. It's also worth noting that the United Nations had sanctions on Iraq and Saddam Hussein refused to cooperate with those sanctions, which were placed on him after he tried to take over the country of Kuwait. Oh and by the way, there were republicans who voted against impeaching Bill Clinton. In response to Librarya: What are you talking about? The only people not granted civil rights by George Bush were terrorists being held outside the United States. Are you at all familiar with history? I mean at all? Do you know anything at all about the way the military works? Did you know that during World War II, Japanese citizens living in this country were sent to interment camps because the government feared they might be a threat? Should we have indicted Truman? I suppose you would have wanted to. During times of war, protective measures are sometimes necessary. If people would stop and think things through they might realize this.

The free market system is a threat. Rugged individualism is a threat. Freedom of individuals to start businesses of their own is a threat. Big unions like to hold the market on all the trades and institute policies that require only unionized companies to perform those trades. When a Democrat states they want to help small business it means just the ones that are unionized.<br>  <br>  The closed door session Biden had with the union thugs this week in Florida was evidence of a close and binding relationship between the Democratic party and the unions. This should be very alarming to anyone who wants to start a business and run it the way they would like. To the home owner who would like to build his own house. To the independent trucker who wants to run his company the way he see's fit.<br>  <br>  We have a union paper mill here in town and the workers are on for 4 hrs. sit for 4 hrs. They have a strangle hold over the company when it comes to competitiveness, It's nearly impossible to fire a union worker. They have a sofisticated, foolish, way of filing grievances, and union presidents and stewarts. It's a joke. After a few where laid off, the talk in town was, don't hire an ex paper mill worker, they don't know how to work. <br>  <br>  I guess my point is unions are infringing on my freedoms and I don't like it. I hold my personal freedoms above all else.

And why is the population of Puertorico below the poverty level, an island under the yanqui flag since 1898?The census of 199 puts the poverty level at 58.9% and in the municipalities reaches a whoopping 70%!! this , for an island -nation that says is "industrialised " and Modern!!Federal transfers net a $8,315 millions [[social security,medicare , veterans ,pensions}but it is clearly very little in comparision what "escapes "Puertorico in the form of gains to the U.S.!Then we have the "informal economy"whose principal component is drug trafficking, it is estimated it brings $25, millions of which  $5 million are consumed in Puertorico and $20 millions are "exported " to the U.S.!!

Both parties are equally at fault with this illegal immigration problem. Simply put republicans want to keep status quo because that means more cheap labor and democrats on the other hand want amnesty so much because it would give them a new voting bloc. That's what it all comes down to.|`|gRfqjemmaa	Democrats love these illegal and legal immigrants, because they know they will vote for them. Keep them just above the poor line, ignorant, and fed. Kind of like the old days when you where told to keep your wife barefoot and pregnant.|`|iWLeHnlnaa	Well, let's do the math and look at some FACTS!<br>  <br>  1. Most illegals do the work Americans refuse to do. If they are deported, then we'll just have a bunch of vacant positions, and more US companies going under.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.

A mask would hinder a soldier from being able to function.. it's hard to see everything and they need to be VERY observant. Plus a mask won't stop a bullet.<br>  2.

Putting them in large areas would hinder movement and make it really hot in their uniforms (they already need to hydrate like crazy, just making it more hot would be cruel).<br>  3. They really don't care about a soldier's life all that much, not enough to spend a lot on him at least.<br>  <br>  They should definitely invest in better protection, but they need it in the right areas and with the right technology (but with technology comes price).|`|9fkDrOFTaa	There is no point in making head wear that will stop a rifle round...

LcYeN6m5aa	it isn't rush that's powerful - its the ideas that have existed in the hearts of americans since 1620 that are powerful - and rush articulates them in an age when it's not well understood or politically correct to speak out on them and people agree with him. <br>  <br>  I want obama to fail in turning us into a socialist destitute country too!|`|U60KCkdcaa	Rush extended an invitation for Obama to come on his show and debate him, which was turned down by Obama. This shows that the president is either not smart enough or is afraid to debate Limbaugh, face to face. <br>  <br>  The democrats have again and again stated that Rush Limbaugh controls the republican party. This is a low down dirty trick to try to make Rush the target like they did to Joe the plumber. <br>  <br>  Going after private citizens is exactly what’s happening here. This is like the scandalous Nixon Administration when it was found out by the media that, Nixon had a enemy’s list. <br>  <br>  The end result of all of this points out the serious nature of Obama and why we should see him as a direct threat to democracy. Rush on the other hand will expand his audience, because of all this one on one exposure battling the white house. <br>  <br>  Dittos Rush, <br>  More power to you.|`|x62wDqmRaa	Rush realizes Obama's alleged stimulus bill is just a giant welfare package and wild, out-of-control spending.  <br>  <br>  Rush knows Obama is sending the economy all the way down the toilet and you kiddies might be living in a derpression for the next ten years. <br>  <br>  Rush wants American people to succeed but he also wants Obama's crazy socialist policies to fail.|`|JmUjtZeYaa	The question you are going to get is "why does rush want obama to fail"?  Just because you want a socialist agenda to fail means that you want America to succeed!  I wish people would understand that.  <br>  <br>  And your question about obama wanting rush to fail???  He doesn't want people to hear the truth.|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	Most probably because Rush's mirror tends to make him look like the elitist, lying, ignorant crook that he is.  Very likely he is afraid that his adoring fans will catch a clue, and begin to question his competence and his policy.  I don't believe that his massive ego could tolerate being less than worshipped.<br>  Then, too, if his public caught on, the baboon would probably cease to be proud of 'her country' all over again, and how much would that suck?|`|AA10757358	Obama wants Rush to fail because Obama wants to keep all of us in the dark as to what is going on.

Many radio peoples have been targeted. Jim Cramer is also being targeted. Laura Ingraham too. Of course, they'd like to lynch Hannity. He's afraid of Rush. Rush is a threat to him. And Rush has 16 million listeners a week. [Obama had zero] Rush challenged Obama to debate the issues. Offered to go pick him up and fly him so there is no expense to the taxpayers.  Are you kidding me? Obama will never do that. Rush would mop the floor with him. Obama and henchmen Emanuel/Carville/Begala underestimates Rush's audience. They are not the homeless drunk bums rounded up by ACORN buses and paid 5 - 10 bucks to vote for Obama.|`|SlhuFfuZaa	O baa ma , the mighty Ram Judas Goat wants America to fail and all that love her and her liberty. <br>  He can't lead his flock to the slaughter if another goat is bleating so loudly that his orders are confused.

This gives a few of the sheep a chance to run into the brush and hide.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	Because he is not a socialist ...I don't like Rush , but I don;t think we should go socialist...It won't work as it hasn't anywhere else in the world.

WE NEED IT more than ever!!!!!!!|`|f9oAVdH5aa	Because he hates private citizens who are successful.|`|53216puqaa	He wants and needs for Rush to be gone, there is a difference.<br>  <br>  By focusing on Rush, he can obfuscate any examination of his actions. Why would the Renfields need to work at their supposed profession (reporters), when they can simply follow the Party's instructions and play  "Pin anything you can on Rush"!<br>  <br>  Add to this the possibility that the "Demonizing" of Rush may cause the feeble minded in his camp to feel the outrage that some Private Citizen would dare to attempt to challenge " Our Glorious Leader" and then Assassinate Rush.<br>  <br>  For Obama it would be a great victory! Think of how the Renfields would allow him to play it for their (shrinking) audience! They can't wait!|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	Obama's biggest fear is that the voters will find out the truth about him and his plans for America.  His motives are sinister at best. Rush is onto him and broadcasting the truth.  More and more people who never even heard of Rush are now tuning in and Obama risks being caught with his hand in the taxpayers till.|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	Each day he and his Party make the entertainer more successful, after all Limbaugh is made to look important and significant.|`|9HRkwzruaa	Because Rush dares to voice his dissent against The Chosen One.

He's giving Rush, O'Reilly, Hannity, Van Susteren, Coulter, et al more ammunition every time he's stupid enough to go out campaigning!<br>  <br>  One of these days - they'll realize they drank the Kool-Ade and storm the White House and steal the "swing."<br>  <br>  (I had a tree, a rope and an old tire. Worked for the entire neighborhood!)<br>  <br>  Edit:  I used to moan and groan when my Mother had Rush on every afternoon. NOW - I find myself turning him on.

If you would listen to the program you would not make that mistake.<br>  <br>  Also if you would listen, you actually may get the context of the statement, instead of the half baked statement you made.<br>  <br>  "Before it's all over it will be called the Ted Kennedy Memorial Health Care Bill."<br>  <br>  This was said in reference to a statement a couple of minutes earlier:<br>  <br>  "the Democrats are pushing for this fall, they'd like it as soon as they can -- if they get national health care, folks, the country as you and I have known it is over, but the failing health of Senator Kennedy is, as I told you way back when, the driving force here.  The failing health of Senator Kennedy is already being used as an inspirational effort, or technique, to get national health care on the fast track"<br>  <br>  So you are just like the liberal media - taking a statement out of context, just to get a jab in at Rush.

The cast system of India is a good example of it. Majority of people live in the lower levels of the pyramid. His agenda appeals to these people. And Americans are not an exception. They want to live like the upper classes. I think too much Hollywood mentality in them. They want to live like that or at least share a wealth like that.<br>  <br>  But a system like this is not sustainable. It's good to start of a country. To equally divide spoils of war between those that fought for the country. But in the end, to be able to evolve into better and more efficient nation they transform to a capitalist system like China.

It is easier to take from others than it is to provide for yourself, but it is wrong.

h1VGrOHuaa	Take the asvab and go through MEPS. However if you want be qualfied for a lot of jobs, everyone suggests you get a 110 gt (part of the asvab). Get some study material before taking the ASVAB. I suggest studying for 30 days before taking the test so that you know what is typically asked on the ASVAB.<br>  <br>  When you go through MEPS and they give you a list of jobs, have them print out the jobs you are qualified. Then research the jobs that you are interested. If they want you to pick a job the same they they offer, don't. The best job is always the one you compared to the other offers. Give yourself atleast one week before making your decision on a job.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	So, go do the meps thing, <br>  <br>  But only sign the papers if they give you a medical job.|`|Sg1h0ecpaa	Do some research online about the medical jobs offered in the different branches.

5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	I'm sorry about what's happening to you, but their behavior isn't legally considered to be any worse than, say, a family pushing their kids to be neat freaks.  Let's say you were born into a family that insists that everything be perfectly in order all the time. In fact, they want you to help clean 2 hours a day. It's annoying and unreasonable, but you can't sue them over it. If they physically abuse you to make you clean the house, then you can bring them up on charges. You can't sue someone for being annoying, it just sucks that your parents are like this.  <br>  <br>  Just put up with going to church and use the time to debate with your Sunday school teacher/whoever is an authority figure. Do it in a respectful, yet forceful manner. When your parents ask you why you're doing this, respectfully tell them that you can't force yourself to believe in something just because it's what they want you to believe. Lack of belief usually isn't a choice unless you choose to close your mind to the POSSIBILITY that there are things out that that we don't understand.  Lack of belief is a state of being. Also, tell them that by forcing you to go to church, they're encouraging you to hate religion. <br>  <br>  You only have 3 more years until you're 18. Just hang in there, and don't let yourself get too bitter towards religious people. They're not all bad, and your parents are just doing what they think is best for you. If they knew that they're driving you away from religion, they would stop.|`|d06cab42016bd85292d8c35998cc1551aa	Do a little research on the background of Marilyn Manson, and show it to them.   He was forced as a child to lead a "religious" life, and now a large part of his music and writings are anti-religion.  Point out to them that forcing you to go to church is only making you dislike it more, and that in a couple of years you will be an adult and will be able to decide whether to go or not.<br>  The fact that you are uncomfortable in church tells me that you may be going to a very strict church.   See if you parents might be willing to compromise a little bit and allow you attend a church geared more towards younger people.   Some churches are the old "Hellfire and brimstone" type, while others are more youthful and festive....with more upbeat music and somewhat fun activities.   May not change your beliefs, but could at least make it less miserable for you.   It could also be a good way to meet some potential romantic interests.|`|epHk7Fb9aa	you wouldnt win that law suit because as i learned the hard way your parents can do what ever they want with you until your 18. but if you want you can go to court and have yourself legally removed from your family to were you no longer have anything to do with them.

I sent him a billion pictures of me and our doggie.<br>  <br>  He made me a cassette tape before he left, just him talking, I listened to it every single night. My friends said I was torturing myself by doing those things, but when I tried to not do them it hurt worse than doing it. It's okay to cry, I cried myself to sleep every night for the first three months. Good luck and I hope you have better days.|`|Sg1h0ecpaa	Before my husband and I got married, he was stationed overseas. Because of the time change, we only got to talk on the weekends. It was tough. And I had days like that. And I'll be honest with you - I HAD to cry it out. I would put in a sappy movie that I knew would make me cry (The Notebook and A Walk to Remember are great) and get a pint of ice cream. I'd watch the movie, eat the ice cream, and cry my eyes out. The next day, I'd remind myself that he would be coming home soon, go to the gym to work off the ice cream, and send him an email to tell him I loved him. Sometimes, you'll have to give in to the emotion. And that's ok. But if it's every day, then you need to think about getting a hobbby to keep you busy so that you aren't dwelling on it. But it is ok to have bad days. Stay positive - you'll make it through this - and be a stronger person for it!|`|vRGgUQ16aa	I am in the same boat right now.  You're absolutely right, some days are easier than others, and today was a bad day for me too.  Don't feel like a wimp for needing him, it's part of the deal when you're in love with a guy you rarely ever see.  I'm not going to say I'm an expert in missing him, but I will tell you what I do.<br>  <br>  1. I write him everyday.  Even when I don't have an address, even when I have nothing to say.  I have two sets of letters - the positive ones that I send, that sometimes are just a single sentance - I love you, and I believe in you more than anything.  And then I keep a set that I don't send to him, a set he will see when he asks for it, that contains all the bad stuff.  Everything bad that is happening, how much I hate being away from him, how I miss him so much it physically hurts.  I do not reread the bad stuff.  Ever.  <br>  <br>  2. I keep all of his letters to me in a box with things he's given me or things that remind me of him - a valentine's day card he sent me before he left, his cologne, a ticket stub from our first date.  I reread his letters, focusing in the I love yous and I miss yous, and reminding myself that he misses me just as much as I miss him.<br>  <br>  3. When I want to contact him, feel connected to him, and I can't, I go onto online forums, like Yahoo! Answers or armybasic.org and I read other people's stories, or try to help them.  Sometimes even just being connected to someone else missing their man helps me.  I also keep in contact with his parents, which makes it easier because I know they miss him as much as I do and they enjoy talking about him as much as I do, so if you have that kind of relationship available, use it. If his family is important to him, he'll appreciate it as much as you do.<br>  <br>  4. I remember.  Before I go to sleep or as I'm walking somewhere, I'll improve my mood by reminiscing - our first kiss, the night he told me he loved me, or maybe just a joke or something he did that made me laugh.  Sometimes I invent conversations we would have about something if we could.  The key is clinging to the good stuff, and being 100% sure that there will be more good stuff in time.<br>  <br>  5. A countdown.  I don't do days, however, because when there are so many, it sounds daunting.  I begin with weeks and then once it gets to about six or five weeks, THEN I go to days.  Fifteen weeks is a lot easier to handle then 105 days.  And once you get to six weeks, it sounds so much more promising that way.<br>  <br>  6. Lots of people say find a project.  This is a good suggestion, but sometimes you don't want anything else, you just want him.  So make him a project.  Instead of thinking of how much you miss him, think of everything you're going to write in your next letter to him, or plan the next care package.  Have fun with it, challenge yourself.  What does he like, what will he want, what does he have time for.  He'll love the stuff you send him, and you'll feel so much more accomplished knowing you're making him happy.<br>  <br>  All in all, forget the people who are calling you pathetic.  They don't know.  They don't understand.  In all honesty, no one knows how you feel but you, and those people obviously have no idea or they would be doing everything in their power to make you feel better.  So screw them.  Find strength in yourself, find faith in your love for him, combine them, and you'll make it.  Always remember that you are not alone, not only because he is out there somewhere thinking of you, but also because there are millions of women who have done what you are doing, and there are thousands going through it with you, myself included.|`|M8504cJPaa	You read over all his previous letters, all those I loves yous and study his pictures.

It's not possible to win...<br>  <br>  Edit: I'd bet they could ally the entire Asian continent and still end up losing "if" they were the invaders.. If they came to us.. Assuming nukes were not involved..<br>  <br>  If the U.S. tried to invade China.. Same result.. U.S. would get smacked slaughtered.. China would win in a matter of months..|`|vOB8mJTgaa	First off China or Vietnam will not attack us.  Mostly for political reasons.  The world economy is so atrocious right now neither country would risk the sanctions the U.N. would put on them for an unwarranted attack.  As far as never winning a war in Asia goes, how many have we seriously fought there?  Two and both were fought with our soldiers hands tied behind their backs by stuffy politicians in Washington.  I would also like to list Japan from World War II but we technically didn't do most of our fighting in Asia.  We just dropped two nukes and scared the hell out of the world, which in turn led to their surrender.|`|bc31594d662102e5c53e9da54ca5195baa	We didn't beat Korea or Vietnam because our interest shifted.<br>  Both wars were not our wars. We fueled the Souths. The Soviets<br>  the Norths. At some point in both wars the ratio of interest and<br>  costs turned bad and we opted out. In Vietnam that ended up<br>  badly for the South. In Korea it ended up in a tie. And your<br>  history teacher might want to refresh his knowledge about WW2<br>  or geography. Last time i checked Japan was located in Asia.|`|YupMCYHlaa	We beat Japan, didn't we?  And we battled North Korea to a stalemate, at least we didn't lose.<br>  <br>  We do have the strongest military in the world, in fact we spend more on weapons and military than the whole rest of the world combined, and sixteen times as much as all our possible enemies combined.<br>  <br>  But our military strength doesn't always work for us because of how we use it.  We see the World Wars of the 20th century as our glory days, so we are always trying to fight those wars again.  In Vietnam and Korea (and Iraq) we were not fighting against a uniformed army, we were fighting the people themselves.  We couldn't tell the good guys from the bad guys, so we ended up just destroying whole villages--kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out.<br>  <br>  In Iraq we depended much too heavily on aerial bombing.  We have unquestioned air superiority so we can just decimate a country from the air, and since there is very little chance of American casualties, there's very little downside.  When we have to actually march in and put our kids in danger and take control, we aren't well prepared.  We get 'stuck' in quagmire wars that are impossible to win and impossible to quit.<br>  <br>  And we are simply not able to go after a country like Iran, that bristles with defensive weapons.  (Not that I'm saying we should, only that if it were possible Bush would have bombed them long ago.)<br>  <br>  I think the reason we don't do well in these wars is that we fight them for the wrong reasons.  These countries don't threaten us.  We are not fighting for our homes, -they- are fighting for -their- homes, so they are willing to endure grotesquely asymmetrical kill ratios and harass us until we give up.<br>  <br>  That's what happened in Vietnam--it was a stalemate until we 'declared victory' and left.  And Iraq is like that too.  We can leave and let the Iraqis fight it out among themselves, or we can stay there another 10 years, spend another 2 or 3 trillion dollars, and -then- leave and let the Iraqis fight it out among themselves.|`|d5ywPNYqaa	We have beaten Japan in World War 2.  Japan is in Asia.<br>  <br>  <br>  If China or Vietnam attacked us.  They would be nuked in minutes.  The only way we could defeat them is with misiles bombardments.  They couldn't get their troops on our land before being destroyed, and we would not send our troops over there.  Their jungle is to thick, and their is alot of people.  We learned this in the Vietnam War.

Xok0CWfcaa	Be sure to go to your school's financial aid department when you get back and fill out all the paperwork to get the financial aid.<br>  <br>  I'm figuring that you are getting the Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve since I'm figuring you have no previous military time on active duty or have been deployed.<br>  <br>  You will get $329.00 a month during the semester while you are at school.  If you take the summer off or a semester off then they don't pay you the $329/mo.  Only when you are going to school. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gibill.va.gov/pamphlets/CH1606/CH1606_Pamphlet_General.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gibill.va.gov/pamphlets/CH160...</a><br>  <br>  If you get activated and deployed overseas (Afghanistan or Iraq) then you will be eligible for more financial aid that can add up to $1000 a month for school.<br>  <br>  You will still be responsible for paying your rent.  The military will be paying during basic and AIT so all you have to do is give your roommate your part of the rent.  The army will not pay for your rent since basic and AIT is considered training and not active duty.|`|3xTNOevjaa	first off, as a reserve, you have to be in it for 6 years before you get free tuition for school. Active duty requires 3 years before you can use the GI Bill for school tuition. But in the long run, yes, it does pay for your school. It all depends on the length of your service within the military branch, remember, you dont get full tuition until you meet certain length.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	As a Reserve, you will qualify for $4500 of tuition assistance each year.  There are two ways to get the Army to pay your full tuition.<br>  <br>  1. 3 years of active duty with the new chapter 33 GI Bill<br>  <br>  2. The National Guard in many states get free tuition to state supported schools.<br>  <br>  Your unit will help you get your tuition assistance when you get home.  Your GI Bill will be the Chapter 1606 Reserve GI Bill.  Google that.  <br>  <br>  You will not be eligible for BAH during Initial Entry Training unless you have dependants.  That's just the way it is.|`|BsJDl6YOaa	Yes in a sense the military gives u full Tuition Assistance and GI Bill so they pay for it and u gain from it.

(It wouldn't be worth driving there for only 1 day's pay, and you usually work longer hours because you have to cram in a lot of stuff.  So in a weekend it is usually either 4 or 5 units of pay (4 or 5 drills).

To paraphrase the last few pages from his book, "The Revolution:  A Manifesto:"<br>  <br>  Ron Paul would generally scale back our foreign empire, with his authority as Commander-In-Chief, as a means of paying our entitlement programs whilst encouraging the Congress to make changes to these programs to eventually eliminate them.  Thus, individuals who are dependent on these programs aren't left out to dry, and the youths who are effectively being embezzled to support these programs would be able to opt-out.  He would also encourage changes in law to allow the Federal Reserve System to be auditted by the IRS, before eventually doing away with the IRS.  He also says that he would make an executive order doing away with all previous executive orders, and he would then abstain from using un-constitutional powers granted to the executive branch by the Congress.  The list goes on.  I would recommend reading his book.<br>  <br>  I'd bet that we'd be a lot better off with Ron Paul as President, even if the federal government was in stalemate until 2010, or longer.  That would give the market a chance to liquidate toxic and worthless assets, freeing up real capital for reinvestment in the system.|`|GwFs2zLbaa	Followed government orders and drove us into depression.<br>  <br>  Thank God he didnt his soul to those devils, he is the only true American that will stand for his people in government.|`|JmUjtZeYaa	I think at first there would have been riots, then people would understand that he was the best pick for presidency.|`|PGyNvZJyaa	Wall Street would feel more secure.|`|Bm9j62Zzaa	he would be pounded daily by the blame stream press|`|iehpzIQBaa	He would be attacked<br>  <br>   I agree he is a good man but that's reality
NiuYkbGMaa	He promised a "New Frontier" but Congress would not pass most of his domestic program. He approved the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion then held back support. He confronted the Soviets over missiles in Cuba. Signed the Nuclear Test Ban treaty and encouraged Germans in a famous speech at the Berlin Wall. He got Congress to pass legislation that created the Peace Corp. He provided support for our space program, promising a man on the moon by the end of the decade. He supported Civil Rights legislation that did not pass in his lifetime. He increased defense and space spending.

Anyone wonder why we don't make anything in this country anymore?

You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are. 17Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?" <br>   18But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me? 19Show me the coin used for paying the tax."

You are telling the USA exactly where you are. <br>  2) If you have in your posetion any issued gear and do not return it they can charge for the theft of same.<br>  3) Being AWOL is nothing compared to the charge of Disertion which holds very "STRONG" penalties.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to contact the nearest military base or recruiter and surrender yourself as soon as possible. You do not want to spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder because of this.<br>  <br>  there are other options as well. Look up on the internet for AWOL hotlines, and for AWOL contacts and you may find people and also the Military has desertion hotlines and they can also tell you what to expect, and or where to go to surrender yourself. In most cases (unless the AWOL or Deserter has other serious charges..) jail time is not usually applied, and you may exspect a reduction in grade, and a bad conduct discharge|`|94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	Best case scenario, is to report to the MP station of the closest military post.

I've seen both happen with AWOL.<br>  You can't run forever, as soon as you get pulled over for a speeding ticket it will pop up on the screen and you will be arrested. <br>  Come back, offer to complete your contract time, and ask to receive a general discharge.|`|tROFU72waa	I'll try not to make this one personal.  <br>  <br>  Call your lawyer, and have him/her notify the US Army for a surrender.

I'm not big on gifts concerning things I've done, etc. It was my job. My duty. An Army coin with his unit or corps if you can find it and know what it is might be cool, something more sentimental than expensive and such would be nice. Other than that, like I said. Some socializing, a night on the town, and a pat on the back would be awesome for me.|`|pTS48Q8uaa	A round would be nice and also the coin is a sick gift im in the Army and my best friend in the Navy gave me a coin with the of if we ever see each other and we don't have the coin on us we have to buy the other a round|`|s8n1pcd2aa	Yes remember that he is still a person as well as a soldier.He's just serving.

No overtime. <br>  <br>  Employee morale was in the basement.

And you would be scheduled for a store 30-75 miles away from home, and it was always a different store in a different location. <br>  <br>  The work could be back breaking as in clothing stores when you had to take clothes off the racks in order to properly count them.

YupMCYHlaa	Unions are responsible for almost every advance made by working people.  Rises in the standard of living, they don't just happen by themselves.  The 8-hour day, the 40 hour week, unemployment insurance, disability insurance, all that stuff came from the union movement.  Even non-union workers got most of these benefits because the employers didn't want a union.<br>  <br>  The rise of the union movement coincided with the biggest rise ever in workers' wages and working conditions, in the standard of living and the quality of life of working people.  And since unions have been in decline, the 95% of us who have to work for a living have not done so well. The richest of us have doubled and tripled their wealth every decade, but the rest of us have struggled to just keep up with inflation.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	"United we bargain.  Divided we beg."<br>  <br>   You are at the mercy of your boss without  the power of the union.

We decide.  We vote, we elect the officers.  We pay their salaries.<br>  <br>  We have our own insurance, we have our own retirement fund.  The company cannot cancel it or lose it in Chapter 11 or in a merger or acquisition, or when I get my ROF.<br>  <br>  And we have our own training centers.  Our Signatory contractors can get their employees trained in new techniques and technologies at union expense.

If that means the wife has to go out to work and the kids get no Christmas presents that won't change a thing.<br>  <br>  Unions cause overmanning leading to expensive inefficient production so home produced goods are expensive.

The collective bargaining and demands of safe work environments for the employees were groundbreaking and very important.<br>  <br>  Modern unions keep people working even when they do something unsafe.  I met a guy while I was doing an internship who bragged that he'd gotten his union rep to save him from being fired because he "fell asleep at the press" on the job because he'd taken a lot of Xanax before coming to work.  He could've been hurt or killed and the company would've been sued, yet they couldn't fire him because he was a union employee.<br>  <br>  Today's unions are basically thugs that kill jobs and companies through greed. <br>  <br>   For instance, the town I live in had a fairly successful Ford subsidiary factory.  When the economy started to slip, the company informed the union that they wouldn't be able to continue to pay the same benefits, etc. and if they couldn't work with them, the factory would close.  The estimate was, with insurance being paid and salary, that employees were making around $35 an hour to stand on an assembly line and do something that anyone with an IQ over 70 could manage.  Most literally were putting in one bolt every minute or so and were upset when their pay was threatened.<br>  <br>  The union basically led the employees to believe they weren't really in danger of losing their jobs and barely conceded anything.  Guess what?  There's a huge building sitting empty and 2200 people just from the factory, not including the other businesses that shut down or downsized because they supplied parts and goods to the factory have no jobs or had to move elsewhere because this was the only real employer in the area.<br>  <br>  Unions today are nothing more than extortionists.  There are other protections in place for safety concerns, and employees don't have to pay dues to people who don't really care about truly representing them if it means they'll get less money.|`|KSXjmaJ6aa	ok for first, take the recession as an example: <br>  if the government makes a union for people who work for car manufacturers such as jaguar then they can supply a private fund for them so that when things like the recession happens the government can get the funds and hand it to the owners of the company to restore them selves without having to cut millions of jobs of regular working people. you can take it this way; get a big money box and every day put in every different currency in coins you have such as a cent and a quarter, but you never use that unless you need to. think of it as not being there.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i answered you question BQ.<br>  see ya!|`|JuzEU8Ryaa	Not if you look at their work for the people!<br>  Unions, for an example, can buy the GM for as little as 900 millions, Friday share of GM times the number of share.

In my opinion what I want for this country is less government, less spending, more freedom, more responsibility for your actions and the following of the Constitution.  In my view, the Liberals want to destroy the Constitution by removing our 1st amendment rights by silencing any opposition to their views (aka - the Fairness Doctrine) and also to remove our 2nd amendment rights by making it impossible for a law abiding citizen to own a firearm.  Guess who will own the firearms then? The criminals who don't care about the law and government.  By the way, I am a mechanic, so I guess that would make me funded by big oil then huh??

r86wXV1Waa	laddie <br>  <br>  i agree with you and Mckinnon, However you try to remember the USA is a paranoid and fearful place, they see threats everywhere, and national security risks in every comment or statement. <br>  the USA like the UK are steadily moving toward the style of government they have been fighting since the end of WWII. the USA is fast becoming what the UK is now , A Communist/ fascist state.<br>  <br>  i spent years in the USSA, i could never understand why the USA routinely gives out prison sentences of over 100 years. a few years a man in Oklahoma was given a total of 456 years in prison for fraud and theft, a murderer was give 15 years and a child rapist was give 5 years and counselling, were is the justice<br>  <br>    when it comes to their national security of which the yanks see spooks in every corner and are as paranoid as a junky. they are as far out of reason as possible. a kid accidentally hacked into a govt web site in 2001. when it was realised he did the right thing and called the FBI to tell them what happened , he told them what he did what he was doing and how it happened, he downloaded nothing ,in fact he called the FBI with in 5 Min's of what he accidentally did.  for his honesty he and his parents were arrested. separated imprisoned for 7 months while being questioned, they lost their home, lost their jobs. <br>  <br>  after this lengthy and over zealous investigation they were all cleared of wrong doing it was proved it was a government security error that allowed the kid access to a restricted government site, once all was realised they were sent on their way. Remember i sad cleared of wrong doing.  So why were they given criminal records, why are the parents now restricted from any level of govt job, no company is allowed to hire them if they do any level of govt contracting to include a company that supplies bin liners.<br>  <br>  this family ( the Gary's) he lost his computer company, she is barred from being a teacher, and the son lost all of his scholarships, they are trying to save money to leave the USA. for a better life. Alas no nation allied with the USA is Allowed to accept them.  they are forced through no fault of their own to live in poverty while they try to get to any other nation that will let them in and allow them to live a good life.<br>  <br>  i think the american dream is a night mare of vengeance, unfairness along with a total disregard for justice and human rights,  just like old Russia was once<br>  <br>  so in the end i am not surprised at the yanks response to their own security ineptitude|`|kJ4g1vujaa	I'm torn between the two sides.  He caused hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage but on the other hand he is clearly as mad as cheese looking for UFOs etc.  I heard him interviewed years ago.<br>  <br>  I don't honestly think he will spend his life in prison - its just a point of principle for the Americans to get the conviction against him.<br>  <br>  Still he's putting up a good fight.|`|E9yH3tWMaa	I believe much of his 'hacking' consisted of viewing unprotected files, thereby showing the incompetence of the Department of Defence.<br>  <br>  The costs incurred by the US government were in implementing basic procedures that should already have been in place.<br>  <br>  The action against Gary McKinnon is purely revenge by the US for the embarrassment he caused. An example of why the US/UK extradition arrangements should be revoked forthwith.

It can be 50/50 with what the ending result will be and sadly we need to go along with the ride.  Obama needs to find a way to balance out enough jobs so that people can once again keep things stable with their own selves thus, people will be receiving paychecks, not welfare or unemployment, but real paychecks.  this will enable them to spend which will hopefully restart the economy on its way back up the chart.

ZzXK3nAAaa	The basic problem is that the pygmies on this site were born after Reagan left office--to them, he's a mythological figure, just as JFK is to the liberals. Nobody seems to remember that his "prosperity" involved doubling both the national debt and the size of the Federal government, neither of which is a conservative article of faith. Dubya doubled everything again. Why are these people called Conservatives? Reagan ended the Cold war by simply outspending the Russians and bankrupting them--but it took all the administrations from Truman onward to build the cumulative effect. No one president did the job by himself; we simply give credit to the last one.

Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., earlier this month introduced the bill, H. J. Res. 5, which, according to the bill's language, proposes "an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to repeal the twenty-second article of amendment, thereby removing the limitation on the number of terms an individual may serve as President." <br>  <br>  IIn 1807 Thomas Jefferson, however, warned that presidents not bound by term limits could use their popularity and power to become kings. <br>  <br>  "If some termination to the services of the chief magistrate be not fixed by the Constitution or supplied in practice," Jefferson wrote to the Legislature of Vermont, "his office, nominally for years, will in fact become for life; and history shows how easily that degenerates into an inheritance."|`|wdBY1fWaaa	No, it's fine.

6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	Looking at the current system, a president really only needs to get three out of four heavily populated states to nearly ensure his election into the Oval Office:  California (55), Florida (27), New York (31), and Texas (34).  This pretty much has been seen throughout the last several elections.  Hitting Pennsylvania through to Illinois also helps (21, 20, 11, 21), but their numbers do not reach the dominating figures of the big four states.  <br>  <br>  Instead of an electoral college, we should shift to a single state vote.  In other words, if the people vote for one candidate over the rest, then that state gives its ONE vote to the president.  This would eliminate weighing the states solely on population.  Instead, this gets it closer to the popular vote for the president instead of voting for someone else to cast their vote for the president.  If that were to be adopted, then there needs to be a minimum state victory number.  Perhaps if a president wins at least 35 of the 50 states, then he (or she) should be confirmed as the winner.  There is a similar system with the electoral college (needing only 270 votes).  <br>  <br>  There have been four incidents where the winner of the popular vote did not win the electoral vote:  Andrew Jackson won the popular vote but lost the election to John Quincy Adams (1824); Samuel J. Tilden won the popular vote but lost the election to Rutherford B. Hayes (1876); Grover Cleveland won the popular vote but lost the election to Benjamin Harrison (1888); Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the election to George W. Bush (2000).<br>  <br>  The electoral college is outdated in my opinion.  I like my idea a little better than a straight out popular vote because there are more and more ways to cheat with a purely popular vote (just look at the current senatorial debacle in Minnesota as the latest).|`|jRtQTN24aa	No. Out of the question.|`|L4eoLmvJaa	no|`|ia2kz4qyaa	yes|`|wyZZgGNKaa	Definitely not. Many of the smaller states would be ignored and candidates would campaign to a select few states with big populations.<br>  <br>  Arm the homeless:  I know, I see your point.  That's one of the main reasons we ended up with McCain.  I do hate that the fact that McCain pretty much had the nomination before I got to cast my vote.  I would love to see changes made to the electoral college but not abolished.|`|UxrC2n9Kaa	I think the electoral college is flawed but serves a greater purpose.  Without it, any Tom, Dick, or Harry could run for President and win.|`|XYTUAzzgaa	if the executive branch of government is going to control the census, then yes.|`|J3Y3HO7Kaa	I like icehound's idea about giving each state 1 point.  There's 50 states plus DC, so there goes the tie breaker.|`|Jn7bt3JTaa	No, Reason why? The next candidate, could say "I'm only going to tax the rural areas of the country. They have too many guns anyway. If they can't pay my taxes to pay for the Programs you city folk want then they can just sell some of their guns or horses." and he would win the presidency. <br>  <br>  The electoral college tries to ensure all citizens get represented.|`|pgdTmT6caa	Absolutely not.

AA10101266	Because it wasn't.  It was about States Rights.  The Emancipation Ploclamation only banned slavery in the Confederate States.  Slavery was banned in the North during and after the Civil War ( War Between the States).  An actual Civil War is when a government is overthrown.|`|T3k7gjBmaa	Perhaps because some of us took history--true history--before liberal revisionists got ahold of the books!<br>  <br>  The Civil War was about States' Rights--with one of the primary arguments being the issue of whether slavery would be allowed to expand to new states, NOT whether or not it would be abolished in the South.  At least not initially.  When it was perceived that the North was losing the war, and Lincoln was rapidly losing popularity and support for continuing the war itself, he issued the call for freeing the slaves.  It gave a the war a moral mandate that it had lacked before.  While it all worked for the good in the end, Lincoln's original intent WAS NOT freeing the slaves.  The Civil War, as all wars, really, was started on ECONOMIC issues--in this case the financial needs of the industrial North versus the financial needs of the agrarian South.|`|kprKXEOSaa	I believe Lincoln said that if he could preserve the nation without abolishing slavery, he would do it.  He wanted to abolish slavery, but knew that doing so might destroy the union.  It doesn't make much sense to our 21st century minds, but to them slavery was normal.<br>  <br>  By the way, the 3/5th thing is misunderstood.  The Southern slave states wanted slaves to be counted as a "whole" person so that they could have greater representation in Congress--you know, because representation for each state is determined by population.  The Northern states didn't want to count slaves so that the South wouldn't have an unfair advantage in Congress.  So, really, the 3/5 bit wasn't racist, it was actually the North trying to get a majority in Congress so they could end slavery.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	Because it wasn't about slavery.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	Because we can read. It was about States rights versus the federal rights.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Because Lincoln said so himself.|`|AA11702773	Read Lincoln's writings.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Because it really wasn't. It was about states' rights to self-determination. That was an argument that went back to the very founding of the country. The 10th Amendment guaranteed states' rights, and even Jefferson said that states had a right to rebel against a tyrannical central government and secede. That argument has been forgotten because of the end result of the Civil War, which was an end to slavery. <br>  <br>  A good end result, naturally, but that was never what the war was about. It was a clash between the industrializing North and the agrarian South, which followed two completely different ways of life at the time.<br>  <br>  The fight, then, was about property rights, and it was also about political and economic self-determination ... all a part of the ongoing debate, begun at the Constitutional Convention, about the balance of power between states and the federal government. The Civil War largely settled that debate, when you consider that before the Civil War, the United States was referred to as "they" -- a conglomeration of semi-autonomous states. But after the war, the United States became an "it" -- a single union, with the states subordinate to the federal government, and the 10th Amendment largely rendered meaningless.<br>  <br>  At the Constitutional Convention, the Hamiltonians wanted a strong centralized government with subordinate states, while the Jeffersonians wanted limited federal power with states' rights to self-determination. With the Civil War, the Hamiltonians, represented by Lincoln, finally won the debate.|`|BsQcplTQaa	Actually that is the truth, The idea was to preserve the Union. Even Lincoln said that he would tolerate the institution if the Country stayed united. Slavery was a cause advanced later to drum up support for the war.|`|AA11209831	Because it wasn't, it was about states rights.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider spending your time on the internet doing some research, and perhaps read a history book or two, instead of posting questions like this.|`|CO2o0YYMaa	Because it wasn't. The War Between the States was fought over states rights. Look it up in any history book. It was not fought over slavery. Both sides had it.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	my history professor insited that it had nothing to do with slavery.  It was about money and politics.|`|nkh3gyr8aa	It wasn't....Lincoln's wife Mary Todd had slaves.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	It wasn't.|`|2bx5l56caa	North and South both had slaves. It was how the western lands were to be managed|`|dseGQ1Jlaa	b/c is wasnt about slavery until Lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation late into the war.  The north needed recruits and the only way to get people intersted in the war was to use something that most northerners cared about, which was slavery.  Funny thing is, the proclamation only made slavery in the south illegal, the north still had slavery even after the Civil War has ended.  Lincolns goal was to preserve the union, not help the slaves.  During reconstruction he refused to help the freedmen and instead rushed to let the southern states back into the union with little or no reparations.  But hey, read a history book and you will learn something.  Taking Civil War classes on the college level will show the real reasons behind it and how slavery was and underlying issue on both sides.|`|oMVSKGKbaa	Next time you are in Washington DC go to the Lincoln Memorial, on the left side of his statue is a quote regarding the war. In part Ole Abe is quoted as saying if keeping slavery would preserve the union it must be kept, if abolishing slavery would preserve the union it must be abolished. His only goal was to preserve the union.|`|BImIMnbzaa	It was never about slavery, it was because of the Confederacy and its attempt to withdraw from the union.  Slavery was alive and well in the Confederate states, whereas most of the Union states were by law, not allowed to own slaves.<br>  <br>  The issue of slavery became a strategic war cry I believe, to encourage black civilians to join in the war, as soldiers.|`|3U1po4Ihaa	Never?  I believe the people you are talking about, seem to know that the civil war was started by several reasons and not just about slavery.<br>  <br>  Lincoln wasn't on all the southern state ballots; which would cause riots if that happened today. Gee, riots.<br>  <br>  States at the time could choose whether they would be free states or slave states, when entering the union.  States had to enter in pairs to make things even; one free and one slave.  That system broke down which caused politics to break down.<br>  <br>  Business- the south was disgusted with the north and it's use of child labor but the north didn't have the labor of slaves to support them.  <br>  You can imagine how the two viewed each other.<br>  <br>  It's called the union for a reason; united states, unity of the states. If territories could enter the union and become states, then why couldn't states leave the union?  Constitution says nothing about making states stay in the union, and lincoln set the stage for future kings.|`|siwxWxa0aa	Because it wasn't. <br>  The War Between the States began because the South demanded States' rights and were not getting them. The Congress at that time heavily favored the industrialized northern states to the point of demanding that the South sell is cotton and other raw materials only to the factories in the north, rather than to other countries. The Congress also taxed the finished materials that the northern industries produced heavily, making finished products that the South wanted, unaffordable.|`|mGTjFgCwaa	Slavery was a sub-issue.

tPvjd8qqaa	Someone got the great idea that offering criminal justice classes to people not in law enforcement was a good way to get people into law enforcement.  A degree or lots of credits were required to get a law enforcement job, for a while.  That dropped off when nobody would take the job.  Now that people are hurting for jobs, the requirement may be reinstated more widely.  <br>  What people don't know is that police officers are screened, re-screened, and then screened again.  It goes like this:  a written test with a minimum passing score, a physical test with a minimum passing test, an oral board examination, then a psychological test with a subjective evaluation, then a medical physical test.  Somewhere in there they offer you a job and an interview with the person responsible for hiring, usually the Chief of Police.  We aren't done with you yet.  If you get hired you then get to go to the Academy where you are scrutinized daily with this lasting about 6 months.  Once out of the Academy you get to go to a Field Training Officer who also scrutinizes you daily.  All the while you are a probationary employee subject to dismissal just because someone doesn't like you. <br>   <br>  So if you don't make it through all of that scrutiny and you have a criminal justice degree intending on being a cop, what do you do with it now?  Well, it is a good beginning on becoming a lawyer.  <br>  <br>  You'd have been better off getting a Public Administration degree or Business Degree.  They teach a similar curriculum, without the law enforcement specific classes, and you have something to fall back on if your police career doesn't go as you expected.  <br>  <br>  Just so you know, I have a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in Criminal Justice.  Got the biology degree for doing forestry work but there were no jobs when I got it.  Got into police work and then got the criminal justice education.  Funny thing is, now I use both.  So it can turn out ok.|`|c07v7O80aa	You would likely get the same entry level job, no matter which degree. The difference would come in advancement.

f9d939f08aa68a4ec14cbfe2f204cf30aa	It is a nasty circle that goes like this:<br>  <br>  We want more services and benefits from our government - whine.<br>  OK but we need to raise the taxes to pay for it. --ok <br>  we need more rights and services and the gov should pay<br>  <br>  Well understand if the gov pays it comes from your taxes <br>  OK well if everyone pays it will not be bad <br>  <br>  And it keeps going round and round till there is not enough income from taxes to handle expenses. Particularly when old debts come due, like 30 year old bridge and road repair and the money has been spent on other things.  <br>  <br>  So some people say - hey the Fed will pay for it. Guess again - the Fed gets their tax money from you the taxpayer. <br>  <br>  Round it goes again. <br>  <br>  Until people are willing to set limits on benefits and learn that they the taxpayer and their children are the ones who really pay for all this stuff, no State budget can ever be kept in control.|`|BVaCJkxzaa	Funny how that works.

Let's take Ronald Reagan, for example. He got a pension for having been in the US Army, a pension for being President of the Screen Actors Guild, a pension for being Governor of California, a pension for being President of the U.S. AND he still had the ballocks to take Social Security. Does that seem right to you? A multi-millionaire on multiple pensions taking Social Security?<br>  <br>  Social Security is supposed to be, and was designed to be, a safety net for retirees to fall back on in case they had no savings and/or other means.<br>  <br>  Like unemployment insurance, Social Security should be there IF you need it. That's the way it was designed to be.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Upon reading Mel's response, it occurred to me that if we had all gone along with Dubya Gump's plan to privatize Social Security 4 years ago, we would have NOTHING left today. All of our Social Security funds would have been sucked up and destroyed by the catastrophic downfall of the stock market and mutual funds over the last 2 and a half years. Zero, nothing, nada.

Qn3CxUeMaa	It depends on your situation.  Directly paying for your PH.D, if you can complete it in your own time while on active duty they will pay for tuition only.  This is moslty designed for undergrades but continues to work for graduate schools.  If you want to go to school full time, for your Ph.D as stated in other answers you can apply for those programs.  Anything else would be covered in the GI Bill after you get out of the Marine Corps, under the GI Bill you have about 50k to spend on education of your choice.<br>  <br>  My recomendation is if you are joining for the sole purpose to get your education paid for, you should look into other branches of service, you won't enjoy being in, or be sucessfull if that is your motivation for the Marine Corps.|`|AA10709853	slim possibility.   much easier to get selected to attend NPS for your Masters degree.   the year DH graduated NPS..there were THREE doctoral candidates and 300 Masters.  <br>  <br>  but you have Tuition assistance, the GI bill if you elect to sign up for it.  in order to get them to pay for any advanced degrees they must be directly related to your field and of course you incur an additional service commitment.

Second, the cops just need to see the image of their face and they have a good idea of who it is.  It's their job to know the local kids who would likely steal stuff.<br>  <br>  My brother once had a pair of Cerwin Vega D9 speakers stolen from his home.  It was a simple matter for the police to follow the tracks in the snow right to the perps house.  They could even tell how out of shape the guy was by the number of times he put the speakers down to take a breather. (yes, he took two trips)<br>  <br>  A local kid decided he wanted a rack full of carharts in a display window.  So he kicks the window - only to have the upper half of the window come down on his leg like a giant gillotine.  He still managed to grab a bunch of carharts and get away.  But again, it was a simple matter for the police to follow the trail of blood right to his house.  His mother even tried telling them he was not home.<br>  <br>  A kid I knew years ago lived in a very small town where everyone knew everyone else.  Still, he tries to steal liquer from the towns only general store.  When he gets caught, he thinks he can just run away.  Everyone in the store identified him to the police and they just went to his home and waited for him there.<br>  <br>  A guy I graduated with broke up with his long standing gf.  This apparently put him off the deep end.  So he breaks into the grocery store where he worked, stole a bunch of liquer, and drops his wallet on the way out.<br>  <br>  The main reason why cops have such an advantage over criminals is the relatively low intelligence and thoughtlessness of the average criminal.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	Those stores have hidden cameras|`|68Qm2W8waa	alot of the times they have security cameras on the ceilings that look like black bubbles and if somebody sees you stealing on camera usually a security guard or store clerk will go up to you as your leaving the store and basicallly bust you. or sometimes when you leave a store it might set off an alarm if you are stealing...usually these people get caught at the store or as they are leaving the store the cops don't usually come looking for them later unless it was a more involved crime like a robbery.|`|AA10224538	Well, it's obvious that you would look rather suspicious if you walked into a store, started browsing, somebody noticed you leaving the store with an expensive garment, say, for instance, a leather jacket that they don't remember you wearing when you first entered the store. If they approach you and you run like a scared rabbit, then they know you must be a thief. They just go back to the cameras for instant replay and they'll nab you soon enough. Just sweat it out and wait for the police.|`|K4VZtIr3aa	They have you on videotape...there's no escape!<br>  <br>  The cops will be by shortly...|`|XiuBD5eCaa	camaras they usually get caught b4 they leave the store

I think the best answer to your question is to look at where jobs have been going over the last 20 years.  Out of the country.<br>  <br>  When Asian car makers built assembly plants in the US, where did they build?  In the south.  Why?  No labor unions.|`|oiRPVN1Gaa	the union im in doesnt do sht for me.  we are 150 (strong) in the area i work but we are grouped in with people who live in much lesser cost of living areas.  so are wages dont equal sht unless we were to live in those areas with the lower cost of living.  my bonus is a measly 600 a year while all the salary people get up to 12%.  are voice doesnt mean a thing in our negotiations and we have a no strike clause.  it sucks but besides that i love my job.  i just hate when they call our wages comparable.|`|Bm9j62Zzaa	I worked in a union....inflated pay, that's why workers like them, but bad company moral, stupid union rules, high union dues....ok if your a moron<br>  but not much chance in getting ahead.

Also union dues are too expensive and only benefit a lazy worker, not ones that give a decent days work for a decent wage...they do NOT provide you with a job at an other union place, so in all its a waste of money to be part of a union|`|687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	Yes but some go way overboard.

None of that got your attention as slightly propaganda like? <br>  <br>  Look, I realize that the corporations have all of the control, but how do you REALLY know that the Fed is in the middle of all of this?  I know it's a group of banks that are in control of money that the Federal gov't is in charge of, but I'm not certain that bankers alone are the ones causing the mess.   I believe that the problem is a failure of neoliberalism.  Long ago keynesian economics began to exhaust itself (early 1970s) and a new form of economics arose.  The management of wealth became more efficient and fewer gov't welfare programs, taxes and regulations were enacted.  This system is neoliberalism. It seems to have worked at first as unemployment decreased and 1st world economies grew, but as the 1990s passed, things began to be based on credit.  Basically, as the supply of CHEAP labor got smaller, corporations became more aggressive in investing overseas. As a result, the gap between the haves and the have nots has grown dramatically, which is causing the global problem that your fear video makes note of in an indirect way.  <br>  <br>  I've read Obama's book, "The Audacity of Hope" and he seems to be aware of this problem and thinks he has a real solution.  He may sound like a run of the mill liberal, but he's keenly aware of the problem of global inequality and the mess that it is creating. <br>  <br>  I don't expect Obama to do anything that many people expect.  He leads deceptively, but in a smart direction.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Ron Paul was right. That video is now in my favorites.

car4UyLFaa	The first joke maybe needs to be tweaked or something, because I totally see the similarity, but there's something missing in the delivery. 2 and 3 got me pretty good :D but 4's a little heavy, and I don't think God would let Hillary or McCain in that easily. Of course, quite a few people are convinced Obama's "the antichrist," and a lot of people seem to worship the man. Anyway, thanks for a couple good laughs! God bless.|`|YupMCYHlaa	How about this one.  A man sees a little boy sitting in front of the supermarket with a big cardboard box holding a litter of week-old puppies.  "Want a puppy Mister?" he asks. "They're Republican puppies!"<br>  <br>  The man thinks nothing of it, but a week later he goes to the market again and sees the same boy.  The puppies are a little older and bigger. "Want a puppy, Mister?" the boy asks.  "They're Democratic puppies!"<br>  <br>  "I thought you said they were Republican puppies," the man says.<br>  <br>  "Oh," the boy says, "That was a week ago.

Q6euzOmVaa	Republicans were involved with all those things. Dems are the savior of this country. They also HELPED make the mess.<br>  <br>  nice rant!|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	You forgot that FDR (Democrat) is the only president to appoint a Ku Klux Klan member to the Supreme Court (Hugo Black).  <br>  <br>  Lincoln, a Republican, freed the slaves with the Emancipation Proclamation and Republicans in Congress also enacted the nation’s first-ever Civil Rights Act, which extended citizenship and equal rights to people of all races, all colors, and all creeds.In 1875, the Republicans expanded these protections to give all citizens the right of equal access to all public accommodations. Struck down by the Supreme Court eight years later, this landmark legislation would be reborn as the 1964 Civil Rights Act.       <br>  <br>  Republicans led the fight for women’s rights, and most suffragists were Republicans. In fact, Susan B. Anthony bragged about how, after voting (illegally) in 1872, she had voted a straight Republican ticket. The suffragists included two African-American women who were also co-founders of the NAACP: Ida Wells and Mary Terrell, great Republicans, both of them.<br>  <br>  Republican Senator Aaron Sargent wrote the women’s suffrage amendment in 1878,though it would not be passed by Congress until Republicans again won control of both houses 40 years later. It was in 1916 that the first woman was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Republican Jeannette Rankin. The first woman mayor was elected in 1926, the Honorable Bertha Landes of Seattle, another great Republican.       <br>  <br>  Democratic opposition to Republican efforts to protect the civil rights of all Americans lasted not only throughout Reconstruction, but well into the 20th century. In the South, those Democrats who most bitterly opposed equality for blacks founded the Ku Klux Klan, which operated as the party’s terrorist  wing.<br>  <br>  Every single African-American in Congress until 1935 was a Republican. Among the Republican pioneers were South Carolina’s Joseph Rainey, the first black member of the House of Representatives, in 1870. Republican Hiram Revels of Mississippi became the first black U. S. Senator the same year. Two years later, Pinckney Pinchback of Louisiana became the nation’s first blac Governor.<br>  <br>  President Eisenhower won passage of his landmark Civil Rights Act of 1957. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen authored and introduced the 1960 Civil Rights Act, and saw it through to passage. Republicans supported the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act overwhelmingly, and by much higher percentages in both House and Senate than the Democrats. Indeed, the 1964 Civil Rights Act became law only after overcoming a Democrat filibuster.<br>  <br>  The first Asian-American U.S. Senator was a Republican, Hiram Fong from Hawaii. The first African-American Senator after Reconstruction was a Republican, Ed Brooke from Massachusetts. The first Asian-American federal judge was a Republican, Herbert Choy. The first woman on the Supreme Court was a Republican, Sandra Day O’Connor. The first Hispanic presidential Cabinet member was a Republican, Lauro Cavazos, Secretary of Education under Ronald Reagan.<br>  <br>  The longest- serving African-American in a leadership position of the U.S. House of Representatives was a Republican, J.C. Watts. The first women elected to the majority Leadership in both the House and the Senate were Republicans, Jennifer Dunn and Kay Bailey Hutchison. The highest-ranking women ever in the majority Leadership in Congress, both currently serving, are Republicans: Kay Bailey Hutchison and Deborah Pryce.<br>  <br>  Let's not forget that Ronald Reagan gained freedom for Americans held hostage for 444 days by terrorists in Iran.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Freed the slaves.

0eFSeap5aa	Modern weapons would wipe out ancient armies.  The Romans and Greeks fought in close quarters, shoulder to shoulder, several ranks deep.  Those massed formations gave them tremendous advantages over less cohesive groups.  However they are ill suited to dealing with firearms.

Even a few riflemen could gun down so many people in such a short period of time the others would flee.  <br>  <br>  The Battle of Omdurman is a good example of the mismatch between modern and more traditional armies.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Omdurman" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_O...</a>|`|5uFXCBpraa	You're talking about a .50 caliber machine gun.

Why do you try to blame him? It was the Bush administration that put us in this crap! You need to do some research! Did you and all of these people asking similar questions just wake from a coma? If so then I am sorry if not you are just not smart at all! Obama was handed this mess down from the previous administration! Bush is the one that started all of the bail outs! It saddens me that there are people in this country that have blinders on to the fact that the administration that had been in office for the past 8 years was to blame for this mess! The war, the economy, and the general depression of the American people! Wake up and realize that Obama was handed down this crap from the Bush administration! It didn't start when he got elected!

c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	lol. I like you.<br>  I share your view. I think that it is important for the gov to respect people a little more. Banning gay marriages will not make people straight ( I don't agree with being gay but I don't agree with a lot of things that people do or become (or wateva), but I think ALL citizens of the US should have the same rights) and for the abortion thing...I would rather a baby to be brought into the world by a loving and stable family by choice rather than force (b/c just b/c something is understood (the theory that sex=child) doesn't mean it was planned on  or intentional ( you know that if you drive a car you could get into a wreck but that doesn't make you walk...etc)|`|uFTO5rs8aa	Republicans hate these things because the Republican party is the party of Christian fascists.  They believe Christianity is against these two issues and so they pander to their Christian base with these issues in order for cheap support.<br>  <br>  They illogical compare abortion to murder, but murder when you killed someone on purpose who has been BORN, not a small collection of cells.<br>  <br>  They hate the idea of gay marriage because, in there mind, the definition of marriage is defined by "God" and Christianity, despite the fact that in American, it is wholly a civil union.  If it was just defined by religion, then atheists shouldn't be able to get married, but they can.<br>  Because marriage affords certain rights, it should available to gays and lesbians, not just heterosexuals.  (Side note: Gays and lesbians spending on weddings would also stimulate some small business such as florists, and catering services, and other services related to weddings, but Republicans are that good at thinking about things like that)<br>  <br>  True conservatism would allow gays to marry since it is a civil right (see Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court case) and true conservatism is against government dictating how people conduct their private lives, especially since Joe and John getting married is in the privacy of their own homes, only directly affecting those two individuals.  <br>  <br>  Republicans are not true conservatives.|`|911851b2b251a8cb71cb5ba956d76d89aa	Personally I'm on the fence about abortion because I can see the validity in both points of view (and don't really care that much) however I lean towards pro-choice because I think if abortion is illegal it is just going to happen anyways and even if it isn't ideal it is a bit excessive to arrest young women and have them serve prison sentences because they couldn't handle the stress/responsibility that comes with a child.  <br>  <br>  With gay marriage people (Republicans) oppose it because like any civil rights movement that is the way it has always been before and people aren't used to the idea of group x (blacks, women, gays) having equal rights.  Yeah they might site the bible but the bible is pro-slavery and so hypocritical that when people eventually accept them they will just ignore the vague passages against homosexuals.  People will eventually realize the only consequence of gay marriage is gays getting married (might produce more $ for the horrible economy).<br>  <br>  As for abortion people are still opposed to that because the thought of unborn babies being killed isn't pleasant.  There is actually a legitimate debate between who's rights come first the woman's or the child's and what is considered human.|`|dseGQ1Jlaa	well, i would never choose to be gay, so i don't have to worry about that.  A democracy is defined as a government that is elected by the people for the people.  Under a democracy, each individual elects officials that best represent them individually. So, republicans typically have higher moral and religious standing than democrats and they vote that way.  People oppose gay marriage b/c God defines marriage as between a man and a women, and we also feel that no one has the right to decide life, which is why we oppose abortion.  We feel it is the killing of an Innocent life and thus goes against our views.  The "don't think about how the other person feels" goes both ways as well.  Liberals tell the republicans we are close minded and yet you never seem to look the other way either.  You tell us that we are discriminating against people who do want gay rights and abortion.  however, if gay rights and abortion are made legal(abortion is) then you are offending us.  The libs don't see it that way though, they don't care if they offend the conservative christians, but the conservative christians sure cant offend anyone else.|`|3lur9XHOaa	OK let's debate on this.  <br>  <br>  Gay Marriage?  While it's a sin, IMHO....they can do what they want to.  However since marriage is a religious term that was borrowed by the State....why not let all joinings be called civil unions and religiously you can call it whatever you want.<br>  <br>  However, homosexual men are high risk catagory for STDs (just ask the FDA about gay blood donations), should we subject children to this household?<br>  <br>  As for abortion.......so are children born from rapes less than human?  That's the argument right there.  Is a fetus a human life or not?!  Heck even if it's not human, does it have the same rights as animals?|`|HReBWI6qaa	They oppose both because both go against the morals of the party, which give the party its strongest foundation.  Although it varies by politician.  Some are cool with gays being together but they don't want them to call what they have marriage (they prefer the term civil union).  The same rules apply to abortion as well (Some believe there should be no reason to have one while others believe that in cases of health threats or rape it should be allowed.)<br>  <br>  Although you shouldn't simply accuse Republicans of trying to run people's lives when both major parties are guilty (Gun control, anyone?)|`|ubrOdZqMaa	Sorry i have gay Friends but am against Gay marriage. Dont you clowns realize that if you legalize this,whats next,polygamy? As for abortion,i feel its a woman's choice,but i don't agree with late term abortion,or as a reason ,because girl was to stupid not to get pregnant.|`|AA11210751	We don't oppose gay marriage...we oppose the government dictating how religions will operate.<br>  <br>  There are other options to abortion. Most Republicans derive their morals from religion. Most religions oppose killing.<br>  <br>  It's not "OUR" God..it's "THE" God, of your choice. Quite a few of the founding fathers were Deists.<br>  <br>  Because you can't appease all religions through legislation...you should appease no religion through legislation. That's why the 1st Amendment is the 1st Amendment.|`|ovNK9IAZaa	Republicans are tards.<br>  Why bring a baby into a world you can't support it in?|`|Ghp39K4Kaa	They hate it to appease the christian-conservative wing of the party.

It is the taking of an innocent life no matter how anyone tries to justify it.  <br>  <br>  Most Republicans acknowledge that some exceptions like rape, incest and the life of the mother might be appropriate.  Only far left nuts think otherwise..|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  I do not care who marries who. I do not think the government should have a say in moral issues.  I think all of the above should fall under states rights but unfortunately the federal government has taken away most of the states rights so we have more conflict because people of like minds cannot rule as they see fit.  i.e. California tends to be more liberal,  Kentucky more conservative, why impose blanket rules on all citizens when neither is happy?|`|BVaCJkxzaa	I think gays should have the right to a civil union. Two gays are not the same as a man and woman and should have something of their own other than calling it marriage. All these rape victims the left is always talking about are offered "morning after pills" as part of their medical exam and therefore make abortions a non factor.|`|BsQcplTQaa	If I was gay and wanted to get married I would use a civil Union. Why do you support abortion and oppose the Death penalty? Its funny to me that some libs tell me the death sentence kills innocents, yet don't have a problem killing something that has committed no crimes at all.|`|AA11091145	You have to assume that the same democrats who came out in force to vote for Obama were the same ones who voted against proposition 8.

SkOALXv9aa	This sounds like a little unnecessary rambling and accusing Christians of being the cause of not taking advantage of some aspect of stem cell benefits.<br>  <br>  While Christians do not believe in abortions or the killing of the unborn.  That does not mean that using the umbilical cord attached to the after birth which is discarded after a child is born should not be used for medical procedures that have shown positive results in the medical field.  <br>  <br>  There are children born blind every day in the United States and other parts of the world.  China has been successful in using a stem cell procedure taken from the umbilical cord to give vision to 100% of the children who have been born blind.<br>  <br>  I too am a Christian and we are at present involved in fund raising efforts to get the $60K that it will take to send our one year old granddaughter to China for the procedure to give her the ability to see like other children.<br>  <br>  Thus far we have through the kindness of Americana's been able to raise $20K toward the $60K goal.<br>  <br>  We have been grateful to Christians as well as non-Christians, democrats as well as republicans and all who have contributed to giving the gift of vision to our granddaughter.<br>  <br>  Maybe one day in the not so distant future this little girl will be able to see the faces of those who love her.

Im4K2eFIaa	Yep. Definitely. It would be ignorant to think aliens don't exist, and our world is so developed that it is highly unlikely that the biggest authorities in the world have no information on the aliens.

PtRmhxU9aa	The courts are (supposedly) bound by their jurisdiction's constitutions. Regardless of what lawmakers or voters say, if the state/US Supreme Courts deems that it violates the constitution, they will strike it down.<br>  <br>  To agree with the lower court is "Affirm," to send it back down for a re-hearing is "remand." The courts can either outright reverse a decision (no further hearings, the decision is simply reversed) or they can reverse and remand, meaning they disagree with at least part of the reasoning and order the lower court to re-hear it.|`|398587d073be2044e73ae194ff808b61aa	The US Supreme Court affirms lower court rulings when they agree with them.<br>  <br>  They apply a test of constitutionality to see if the law meets the standards.  If not, it's thrown out.  <br>  <br>  Think of it like this...<br>  A teacher in a classroom makes rules for her classroom. (actual lawmakers)<br>  The principal of her school has oversight of those rules. (lower courts)<br>  The school board has the final decision on rules IF they come to them. (Supreme Court)<br>  <br>  For instance, Miss Teachem makes a rule that all students who are late for class have to stand under a neon sign that says "I was late!" until lunch.<br>  <br>  Little Billy is late, has to stay under the sign and when he gets home that night he tells his mom.  She's outraged and goes to talk to Miss Teachem about it, saying she doesn't want her son to be humiliated.  Miss Teachem says she's sorry, but that is a classroom rule and it can't be bent for any student.<br>  <br>  Billy's mom goes to Principal Crankypants, who completely agrees with Miss Teachem's rule, even though it's kind of iffy in the code of conduct.<br>  <br>  Billy's mom then goes to the school board, who looks at the code of conduct for teachers, sees something about not humiliating students and agrees with Billy's mom.  Miss Teachem can't use her neon sign any more.  (But don't worry, she can't get a reprimand either, the teacher's union won't allow it.)<br>  <br>  It's an oversimplified example, but you get the idea.<br>  <br>  Now please tell me this isn't for homework!<br>  <br>  OH!  One more thing!  The Court likely will pick one element to rule on and it may not even be the exact one that the person is complaining about, they try and do as little to forge new definitions and precedents as possible.  In my example, rather than decide the practice was bad, they could say using neon signs in a classroom is bad and shoot the rule down because of that.
YupMCYHlaa	The govt. already has plenty of opportunities to propagandize people and program their minds.  I think this is just another conspiracy theory.<br>  <br>  The standards for US TV were drawn up before WWII!  The National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) decided how many lines, how much bandwidth, etc., back in the days of vacuum tubes.  The 6SN7 tube was the ultimate high-tech in those days, the dual core Pentium of its time.  The standards were based on a 9" screen!  4.5 mhz bandwidth per channel, audio and video.  It's amazing those pictures look so good today!  They never even anticipated we'd need more than 12 channels!<br>  <br>  In order for TV to move to the next level of technology, channels have to have a much wider bandwidth to allow for more resolution, stereo sound (and multi-channel sound), etc.<br>  <br>  So that's one perfectly good reason for the switch.  If you want to look in to conspiracy theories, consider that up to just a few years ago, ALL of the radio and TV spectrum was considered public property, and broadcasters were required to perform a public service in return for their use of the airwaves.  But since Reagan, the broadcast spectrum has been considered to be 'owned' by its FCC-licensed occupants.  The new spectrum for digital TV, slots were SOLD to broadcasters so they could OWN them outright.  They were probably sold pretty cheap too, considering their value in perpetuity.<br>  <br>  Then, not very many Americans still watch TV over the air, but most of these people are poorer, minority, older, etc.  Many stations reach most of their customers over the air, and it was a bigger burden on these broadcasters because not as many of their viewers would follow them to the digital channels as stations with more cable and satellite viewers.  Univision, the Spanish language network, figured they'd lose a large percentage of their viewers.  So Congress decided to make money available for set-top converters.  I have to wonder what portion of the money we got for the sale of the bandwidth went into these coupons for converters.<br>  <br>  SSSS is blue-sky stuff. It sounds like a paranoid fantasy.  50 years ago there was a big flap over 'subliminal advertising' in films.  It was thoroughly tested and found not to work.|`|aSTmFCiBaa	they wanna make sure we dont miss no commercials,,,,,think of it,another thousand channels of 18 minutes of commercials every half hour,,,aooooooooooow,I can hardly wait,the conversion devices will be in thrift shops for 10 bucks,till that happens,,,,,Imohnpayyass,the govs reasoning is simply that it feels tv is indispensible|`|u66x8JHjaa	Digital TV can go both ways, in and out of your house.<br>  Analog TV is one way only, in.<br>  <br>  <br>  Read "1984", if you sit in the right spot in your house the TV won't be able to see you.

NizZxEWoaa	Yes you can get pregnant, and no you will not be deployed while you are pregnant. If you are pregnant and your unit deploys you will stay to have the baby and then 90 days after having the baby you may get deployed and meet up with the rest of your unit in iraq or Afghanistan. The military has plenty of pregnant females. They already have rules and regulations about what pregnant females can and can not do.

It is up to you.|`|AA10709853	okay, they cannot forbid you to have children.   but what they will do is  suggest very strongly that you time it so that you are not pregnant when it comes time to deploy.    you get six weeks post partum and you are deployable, period.  <br>  <br>  getting pregnant a month after you find out your unit is about to deploy can and WILL get you into trouble however.  getting pregnant on your 2 week R&R during the deployment DEFINITELY gets you into trouble.|`|xzmKhrmjaa	My answer is yes...Because it can be your inspiration to work harder or to do the impossible.:D hope i can help.

In reality, this spectrum is a circle where you ultimately end up with the Nazis and other Fascists on the extreme right and Communists on the extreme left. The spectrum is  circular because of the fact because the governments of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were both Totalitarian in the scale of government power that there are similarities vaguely between the two. These similarities are the result of the increase of government power within the country. The routes they took to get there are vastly different. The Soviets got there by going left, the Nazis got there by going right.<br>  <br>  Conservatives have interpreted the political spectrum to be a linear line between good and evil points. Since they see themselves as good, in their mind, it is best to be as far to the right as possible. To balance this, they put all the world's totalitarian regimes on the extreme left, and explain that placement by drawing as much attention to the similarities between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and ignore the vast differences between Nazism and Communism. And since the American political system is a competitive two party system, they view liberals and Democrats as being both of these polar opposite movements, because in their mindset, Communism and Fascism are the same thing.|`|f4Yec6iNaa	Most people think of politics as being left and right.

It's past your bedtime.|`|d6zV9keLaa	hmmm... Well I personally don't think I like him too much but there are some things you have to think of about your question. First of all, he did not pick his middle name that I am aware of. We have to get out of this state of mind that we should believe what we are told and following our parents or guardians beliefs. That's what makes us fail at moving ahead in this world. Secondly, how do we know for a fact that he treats his mother like pooh. I mean that fact is we don't know their relationship. She could have done some mean stuff to him or he may just have a reason. Personally my father and I do not get along, in fact we hardly talk. The thing is my father and I have a long complicated and troubling past. So think of it like this, President Obama is not our friend and he will never share is true feelings and opinions with us because he doesn't know us and it is personal to his, we don't know his life other than what the news says and we have to take that with a grain of salt. Third, as far as his dad just look at what I wrote about the mother issue. We (as a nation) elect him because he is perfect, the fact is no president EVER has had a clean record and loved for all his beliefs and morals and behavior. We elect because we have a limited choice and it is a civic duty. He made not get us out of this depression but and Bush and previous presidents are not the only ones we can blame. The gas companies, all companies that send work out to China and other countries, ourselves (yes you and me) for not buying US made products and so much other stuff. I don't know how he will lead this nation but I like to try and think that my nieces and nephews and love of my life won't have to endure this BS for too much longer. To each their own.

We have to wonder what on earth he is hiding, we can only presume it is that he wasn't born here, but we really don't know.<br>  <br>  The previous cases were not thrown out because they said he had proof.  They were thrown out because the people bringning the suit lacked "standing".  Meaning they were not the right people to bring the suit.  In the last suit, the court just refused to hear it.  A new suit is being prepared by member of the military, since they are subject to orders from the president.|`|ss393Fuiaa	I don't know about that.

The fact that he refused to produce his birth certificate is a good example of what we can expect from him.  All smoke and mirrors and no substance.  And his economic recovery plan is exactly the wrong thing to do and will continue to drag us all down, down, down.  Hopefully everyone will wake up and vote him out along with the despicable Democratic congressmen.|`|26pU02cDaa	No, I don't think so. No one ever proved it.

Some would have you believe he's been "completely transparent" on it.  There is a difference between a birth certificate and a certification of live birth, which is what he has.

n2oEhdZiaa	It depends - most of the time you'll go to the closest training facility that will meet your needs.  For example, some tennessee national Guard soldiers have to go to Ft Knox, KY because that is the closest base to use their tanks and bradleys.  You will always report to your armory for drill, (whereever home station is) and then as a unit in their vehicles and on their dime will then travel to wherever you are training.|`|lEaT5q06aa	once a yr we did a MUTA-6<br>  formation was held at 0001 on a Friday AM in Rhode Island Naval Sta<br>  home unit is army reserve at Ft Devens Mass<br>  load aircraft, fly to Salinas parachute jump, in south east Puerto Rico<br>  helicopter to St Johns island for an overnight movement Friday PM<br>  water pickup from south side St Johns on Sat AM, chopper to Ft Buchanan (north side PR), Sun AM at about dawn fly back to RI and be dismissed from there about 3 PM<br>  <br>  C-130's for flights which is slow<br>  <br>  2 guys missed movement on sunday AM, caught a civilian flight to boston, rented a car and met us at the air station, they got there 90 min prior to us, were present for final formation, and thus avoided a "missing movement" charge (by the grace of the company commander)<br>  <br>  thanks for the memory|`|BovpXrk1aa	yep|`|GJ3tNgWNaa	Yes they can but it is not likely if you are jr enlisted (e1-e4).

hkf7eeu9aa	When you are at school teachers and administrators are "in loco parentii" meaning in place of the parents. There are limits on teachers, but not like with police. So teachers can search your stuff, especially once you're caught breaking a rule. So if you aren't supposed to have a phone at school and do, they can look through it all they want. They can even insist that you give them your password. My advice is if you don't want a teacher to look at something, don't bring it to school.|`|GHusBLjgaa	No the courts have ruled that schools are a special circumstance. While on school grounds teachers act as your legal guardians hence the can not be charged with an invasion of privacy. Further in many districts at the start of the year you and your parents sign a bunch of papers which cover this. As such if you signed these papers you know have given consent to for them to conduct such searches. <br>  <br>   Think about it another way out in the city the police can not have drug dogs search through your stuff without a reason but at school no such restrictions apply.|`|AWSmknxLaa	NO.  The school has the authority to search and confiscate.<br>  <br>  Why in the world would anyone bring their phone to school.<br>  <br>  It is for learning...not chit chat|`|71wBNgbnaa	That really is an invasion of privacy. While it may be against the rules in some schools to have your phone with you or on, it's also against the law for them to snoop through your personal belongings (including electronic devices) without just cause. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would tell my parents and ask them to contact school administration. If you get nowhere with administration on the school level, contact your county/district board of education. These teachers need to be reprimanded, as there are laws to protect students' privacy. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped, and good luck! :)|`|RJcVtLAxaa	They can't do that unless the incident was something illegal. If it WAS something illegal, then yes they're allowed to search your phone. It's happened at my old high school plenty of times.|`|c3BSyJnGaa	pretty much yeah. you shoiuld probably get on that.|`|WXtdiVB4aa	There should be its invasion of Privacy<br>  Take your battery out when you give it to em or put passsword on it they can't do crap if you take battery lol|`|rvPyP4DBaa	That's a complete violation of your privacy, and I would tell your parents about it if I were you.
n2oEhdZiaa	Usually it's not a first phone interview thing, but if they were going over a lot of things, he may have come to that question on the paperwork.  It doesn't matter, it just has to do with if you have special needs for the way your body is handled after death.|`|93r3nCM1aa	They do it so that they know what your religious accomodations are for boot camp (yes, you get to go to church in BCT), burial things, etc....he'll be asked that question a few more times in the future.<br>  <br>  My husband is an atheist, and his recruiter put down "no preference"<br>  <br>  It's just standard protocol...they gotta make sure you're not a JW too (just in case they let you in and then you refuse to pull the trigger)|`|HzdfVhynaa	No, you shouldn't be worried. The religion preference is on the Prospect/Applicant Card. The Marines do not judge people on their religion. Every person that is talked to is asked that question. That PAC card is then turned in to the command. If the person joins it will be the religion that shows on their dog tags. Don't worry about it. It's a mandatory question.|`|nMCcWjy5aa	no it goes on paperwork. He will be asked a couple times after that and it will end up on his dog tags. That way incase the worst happens his body can be handled the way his religious preference would handle it.|`|qXf9zfJ4aa	No Why, they have to write it out on the forums anyways.<br>  <br>  MKC are you kidding me. i just signed up a month ago believe me i would know what they ask. whats the big deal about your religion anyways. why be worried?|`|RyFCRcIUaa	Does your brother worship the devil, evil, and practices sorcery and black magic?!

Obama is left and at least half the country does not agree with him. <br>  <br>  Nobody cared if black man became a judge because he was a conservative and nobody cares about the skin color of the current GOP leader.  No racial tensions from whites, but liberal or democratic blacks do care.|`|vPDYIkqDaa	question for you: how do you think Obama got elected? also, have you ever heard of reverse racism?  <br>  <br>  answer to your question: I think more white people are making a big deal about his skin color because more black people voted in this election than any other...ever. Guess who the majority voted for? Coincidence? You decide.|`|xhSsby6Taa	i don't think most people who are against him are against him because of his skin color. the real reason is that he is ruining our country, he doesn't know what he's doing, he is making a mockery of the presidency, etc...

c07v7O80aa	Absolutely not true. Of course, anyone can lose their job for any reason, and the absences that sometimes are necessary in domestic violence cases could result in loss of a job, but it wouldn't be specifically on account of being a victim. <br>  <br>  In a roundabout way, a domestic violence victim could be barred from child care, but it would be in a situation in which she was assaulted and exposed the children to risk by repeatedly letting the perp move back in with the children, exposing them to risk.

The federal reserve manipulated interest rates causing excessive growth and a bubble that couldn't sustain itself.  Lenders were actually forced by the government to lend to people that were high risk and should never have been able to borrow in the first place.  A housing bubble was created when the government decided that everyone in America should own a home.  This drove down housing prices and caused malinvestment.  Google: the Austrian theory of the business cycle to understand this phenomenon.<br>  <br>  Capitalism always works because it is self regulating.  It is actually the faith that politicians can spend money more efficiently than the free market that causes most of our economic problems.<br>  <br>  Right now we are bailing out bad debt with US tax dollars just so these failed companies can continue to fail.  We could have liquidated this bad debt and allowed competing companies to step up and fill the void but instead the government chooses to intervene.  I was going to start a business last year but I would be taxed to the point where it would not be worth it and there's too much paperwork to fill out now.  Because I can't start the business I wanted to, new people won't be employed and new wealth won't be created.  Now multiply that effect times a few million.<br>  <br>  I can't sit here and type all day but check out www.mises.org for solutions to all your questions. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Your second question: "Wasn't it capitalism that created sweat shops, air pollution, laxed environmental laws, and many other social ills?"<br>  <br>  Capitalism is what enabled us to create more wealth and have an economy in which we have more employment opportunities.  Cell phones and computers are a result of capitalism which created millions of new wealth-creating jobs.  If the government created jobs then we would be paying people with other peoples money.  The government can only pay people through other peoples taxes or through debt.  The reason there are no more sweat shops in the US is because employees can just go to another business that competes for good employees.  You make yourself marketable and businesses have to compete over employees.  A business in the US with a sweatshop wouldn't be successful because no one would work there if there's a better place to work- which there is thanks to capitalism.  The socialism that's occurring now is taking us in the opposite direction.<br>  <br>  In a capitalist society you will have property rights and it is illegal to destroy or harm your neighbors property.  Otherwise where you don't own your property people won't care about it-- they won't mow their grass, they won't care about polluting the land, etc.  Why?  Because who would care about taking so much care of property that they can't even call their own?

Capitalism didn`t fail , those in charge of promoting it failed !! They are still failing today !!<br>  <br>  * More than a decade after A Nation at Risk drew attention to the nation's educational mediocrity, the reading proficiency of nine- and thirteen-year-olds has declined even further. <br>  <br>  * The 1994 National Assessment of Educational Progress found that a third of American seventeen-year-olds say they are not required to do homework on a daily basis. <br>  <br>  * Only one high school junior out of fifty (2 percent) can write well enough to meet national goals. <br>  <br>  * Less than 10 percent of seventeen-year-olds can do "rigorous" academic work in "basic" subjects. <br>  <br>  * In the United States today, only one in five nine-year-olds can perform even basic mathematical operations. According to the 1990 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), only one in six nine-year-olds reads well enough to "search for specific information, interrelate ideas, and make generalizations." Only one in four nine-year-olds can apply basic scientific information." <br>  <br>  * Among American thirteen-year-olds, only one in ten can "find, understand, and summarize complicated information." Only one in eight eighth graders can understand basic terms and historical relationships. One in eight understands specific government structures and relationships." <br>  <br>  * Only one in eight thirteen-year-olds can understand and apply intermediate scientific knowledge and principles. The NAEP found that the percentage of American thirteen-year-olds who understand measurement and geometry concepts and can analyze scientific knowledge and principles "was among the lowest of many countries in the developed world."" The 1990 NAEP concluded that "Large proportions, perhaps more than half of our elementary, middle, and high school students are unable to demonstrate competency in challenging subject matter in English, mathematics, science, history, and geography. Further, even fewer appear to be able to use their minds well." <br>  <br>  * The writing ability of American students is little short of appalling. American schools, according to the NAEP, produce few students who can write well. Only 3 percent of American fourth, eighth, and twelfth graders can write above a "minimal" or "adequate" level, according to the 1992 "Writing Report Card." The test, which rated students' writing abilities on a scale of one to six, found that fewer than one in thirty American children earned a score of five or six, which meant they could write effectively and persuasively. Only one out of four students even managed to write at the "developed" level, which earned a score of four. "Even the best students who could write effective narrative and informative pieces had difficulty" writing persuasively, the study found." In 1988, only 3 percent of American high school seniors could describe their own television viewing habits in writing above an "adequate" level. <br>  <br>  * A "reading report card" finds that 25 percent of high school seniors can barely read their diplomas. A standardized test given to 26,000 Americans sixteen and older "concluded that 80 million Americans are deficient in the basic reading and mathematical skills needed to perform rudimentary tasks in today's society. 1113 A 1993 study by the U.S. Department of Education found that 90 million adults - 47 percent of the population of the United States - demonstrate low levels of literacy. The level of literacy among adults had fallen by 4 percent since 1986 . <br>  <br>  * Only 15 percent of college faculty members say that their students are adequately prepared in mathematics and quantitative reasonings lower proportion than among higher-education faculty in Hong Kong, Korea, Sweden, Russian, Mexico, Japan, Chile, Israel, or Australia. Only one in five faculty members thinks students have adequate writing and speaking skills. <br>  <br>  * A Washington, D.C., grade-school teacher reports that many of the fifth- and sixth-grade students in her geography class were unable to locate Washington, D.C., on a map of the United States, even though they lived in the nation's capital themselves. A survey by the Gallup Organization found that one in seven adults can't find the United States on a blank map of the world. This shouldn't be surprising. In one college geography class 25 percent of the students could not locate the Soviet Union on a world map, while on a map of the forty-eight contiguous states, only 22 percent of the class could identify forty or more states correctly. <br>  <br>  * Despite the growing importance of scientific knowledge, surveys have found that Americans are woefully ignorant of basic scientific facts. A majority of Americans,. for example, do not know that the earth and sun are part of the Milky Way galaxy, and a third of t|`|BsQcplTQaa	Failed? it works better than any other economic system that has been tried.|`|AA10438532	name 1 socialist country that is or has done well.

The only way I can see he would be in breach of covenant would be if his activities, whatever they are, pose some kind of physical danger to the property - all tenancies are subject to an implied covenant that the tenant will generally take care of, and not damage, the building.

Unless you're in Utah or Idaho, it's more of a liability than a boost.<br>  <br>  There are Mormons all over state and federal governments. Here are links to a bunch of them:<br>  <a href="http://famousmormons.net/pol.html" rel="nofollow">http://famousmormons.net/pol.html</a><br>  <a href="http://famousmormons.net/pol2.html" rel="nofollow">http://famousmormons.net/pol2.html</a><br>  <br>  What is hypocritical is that the Evangelicals have a problem with one "because he's Mormon" but not with the rest of them.  There are many examples to choose from to look at the track record of Mormons in governmental positions.  There's no compelling reason, based on their history to NOT put a Mormon in any government office.  <br>  <br>  At the end of the day they tried to make a religious issue a political one.  <br>  <br>  Mitt has a very long, successful track record of waltzing into large, corrupt, bankrupt, screwed up organizations and fixing them.  What's bigger, more corrupt or more bankrupt than the US federal government.  Everyone else is just talk.  He's actually done it and done it well.<br>  <br>  Bush isn't presidential enough.

Look at the big picture versus what the politicians are telling you.  By the way, questions that would help you get a better answer.  <br>  <br>  1.  Who put us in debt in the first place (US budget deficit)?<br>  2.  What is the debt and how is it calculated?<br>  3.  What is "the economy" and why is the solution similar to supply side economics which is what Republican president R. Reagan began (and HW and GW Bush continued).<br>  4.  Why do either party cry "You're not all that" to each other all the time and does it really, really matter DEMs or REP?  <br>  5.  What would really fix "the economy"?<br>  <br>  If you look at the continuum of history from pre WWI that is where monarchies began ceding power to the merchant classes.  This result in it's most extreme realization is what happens when merchant goals are allowed to run government regulation/deregulation.  Ironically, while GW stated he stood for a Christian ethic he really let money rule.  End result:  money pooled in individualized holdings with none left flowing around in the economy.  Result is the same as when Titanic hit that iceberg.  Compartment after compartmental failure and down the whole ship goes.  To some degree, blowing air into the ballast helps, but ultimately the ship/economy design is seriously flawed.  That's the real goal.  Whether ANY US government fixes that is my question.  GW's solution was to blow air into the ocean.  BFD at least Obamas have checks and balances.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Reduce Federal spending by cutting our overseas empire, which cost over 1 Trillion a year to maintain.

He is not a warmonger, a warmonger is someone who STARTS wars, he is painstakingly trying to end our illegal occupation of a once sovereign nation!

Bin Laden, the rag head was our boy for years and we gave STAMs (shoulder to air missiles) and trained him and his guys in the Afghani-Soviet conflict. The fact that our little terrorist turned on us is nothing new... we support nasty people, and then when they show their true colors we act like we never liked them.

Karl Marx's ideology was about equalization for all people, not just for a "master race". The NSDAP, which was led by Adolf Hitler, did not call themselves "nazis", but rather national socialists.

Totalitarians are not conservative. Conservatives believe that government is or should be restricted to a defined,circumscribed area of control, with individuals, families, and business having their own spheres beyond governmental intervention whereas the totalitarian considers all manner of human endeavor (family structure, religion, the arts, the market, etc.)to be the sole province of government to mass-mobilize, control and harness for the nation.  Essentially, then, the Nazis and Fascists must be classified as non-internationalist, ultra-nationalist and anti-Communist socialists. They were violently intolerant(obviously genocidal in the case of the Nazis) certainly but big industry had to be subordinate to the state and devote its resources accordingly (see Siemans, I.G. Farben and other companies); a business which resisted Nazi or Fascist control would not be permitted to exist and its executives most likely would be condemned to concentration camps--or worse. I would recommend Jonah Goldberg's tome, "Liberal Fascism" for the intellectually inquisitive and historically minded.<br>  President Barack Obama is not a Nazi and has not called for the physical extermination of any persons belonging to any race, sect, or social class but the legislation signed into law and currently on the horizon could legitimately be classified as anti-capitalist and closer to Marx and Engels than to Adam Smith or Milton Friedman given that the government is increasingly acquiring ownership of the means of production.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	National SOCIALISM = Nazi.<br>  <br>  This was pointed out the other night by Michael Savage on Savage Nation.<br>  <br>  Today the government just took over Citi.<br>  <br>  Congrats, fellow National Socialists.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	The term NAZI is short for the German <br>  "Nationals-sosialistiche Deutsce Arbeiter-partei."<br>  Translation (National Socialist German Worker's Party)<br>  <br>  Obama is not a eugenicist, he is not an anti-semite, he is not a dictator or fascist.

So if Bush gets that blame, HE should get the responsibility for us still being safe.<br>  <br>  If Obama hasn't had enough time to fix the economy, he hasn't had enough time to keep us safe.   That's BUSH's fault ;)<br>  <br>  Damn Canadiens. <br>  <br>  Some reasons why Canada sucks:<br>  <br>  (1) Canada gained independence from England in 1982.<br>  1982! Can you believe that? Practically yesterday. We told those British popinjays to take a hike over 200 years before those lazy Canucks got around to it.<br>  <br>  And guess who still has the queen on their currency? I'll give you a hint: Canada.<br>  <br>  (2) Rich people must pay for health care for lazy bums.<br>  Imagine being coerced into paying for health care for undserving lazy scaramouches who sit on the street corner day after day, chugging down a 40oz Mickeys before noon.<br>  <br>  Those cretins don't deserve a nickel, let alone expensive medical treatment paid for by wealthy, upstanding members of society.<br>  <br>  Fact: If you're poor, it's entirely your damn fault -- and you deserve a short miserable life of pain and suffering.<br>  <br>  (3) Draft dodgers.<br>  And this is the big one. Where do you think those America-hating draft dodgers run off to when the going gets tough?<br>  <br>  You're damn right they go to that God-forsaken hellhole known as Canada.

AA11784965	Hey Pete! Good question & answers, with maybe the exception of ole Buffytou.... up there. I'm not considered Republican elite, by any means, but I am a conservative who votes with her mind & heart and often outside of "party" lines!! By the way - HAS the Secret Service popped in yet? NO? I'm surprised, dude!!<br>  <br>  Okay - here's my stand, my 2 cents - for what it's worth: whether you voted for him or not, whether you agree w/his policies or not, whether you think he's the right man for the job or not, Barack Obama is STILL the President of the greatest country in the world, the United States of America - OUR country, yours & mine. He is OUR President, for better or for worse, and he needs our support in all matters, not death threats or wishes from naysayers. Anybody who wishes or thinks that is NOT patriotic OR a Patriot, by any stretch of the imagination.<br>  <br>  I did not vote for the man, but he is still MY President & as such deserves my respect & support, which he has. I don't wish death on him, and I pray every single day that he listens when God attempts to guide him into what is right for the USA. Okay, then - I'm done, for now. Thank you for listening!!|`|6CAsx3jaaa	people claim lots of things that arent true. some parents can abuse their kids and still claim they love their kids. they may in some sick way but there actions arent right. anyone that would wish ill on this leader after only 30 days and with the trouble wer in are crazy|`|ajrnlFczaa	Hi Pete, Please do not include me in that generalization.<br>  <br>  I love my country and pray for Obama's salvation in Jesus Christ.  <br>  If Barry/Barack will truly repent and turn his heart toward God, he will want to do the right thing.|`|d5KjFHwkaa	No. Simply put.|`|AeEnMEgJaa	Excuse me, but did I fall asleep and miss when President Obama proposed a Final Solution to congress?<br>  <br>  How on earth can anyone (I'm looking at YOU jaker) compare our president to a genocidal maniac like Hitler?<br>  <br>  I completely disagreed with George W, but I NEVER wished him harm.

Here in the UK people wish death and more on elected representatives without feeling that they are being unpatriotic. The things I read about what they would like to do to Gordon Brown would make wishing death on Mr Obama a minor thing.<br>  <br>  Lets face it, at the end of the day a lot of folks are just being what we might expect. I'm not going to say what that is, but I'm sure you get the drift.<br>  <br>  It amuses me that people are so threatened by the idea of Obama. It's a good sign that he is doing good work, if folk are being so mean about him.<br>  <br>  I don't think it makes people less American. Maybe just mad as a brush.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	No. <br>  <br>  Just my opinion anyways! In the name of a Country or in (a) God, many horrible acts have transpired.

Its people like you who prevent people from thinking on their own and who likes to influence other people's opinions. Do you know why Obama's approvals rating are low? Its because George Bush messed up the country really bad. Obama is in a bad situation so obviously, it will be much harder to please the American public. When Bush was in office, it was the culmination of Clinton's term, when life and the economy was the best. Clinton had a 65% approval rating when he left office. All Bush had to do was just stand there and do an average job, but he couldnt even do that. <br>  Now, I'm not supporting Obama either, because I believe he manipulated the public with this eloquent speaking and ideals of "hope and change" which fabraicated the idea in the American public that things would turn for the best immediately. Because of this, the public feels a little betrayed that things are not improving faster.<br>  <br>  Blame capitalism. Socialism right now is the best possible economic system which supports the individuals. Many people believe that the economic crisis was caused by government interference, but this ISNT TRUE AT ALL. It was lack of government influence. Ever since the Reagan era, and his idea of the trickle down effect, the US government limited interference with businesses. But Obama, wants to change all that, and wants to establish Socialist ideas. Did you know that the bank bailout is a socialist idea? As the government now controls the banks. With socialism more jobs will be created, and if a person loses his/her jobs, their is less stress on his/her family because there is free healthcare and education, and the government creates a system in which in will be easy to purchase. There is no job security in capitalism, as tomorrow, one can easily be laid off. Is this fair? And without any support from the government, people will become much more poor. Capitalism is survival of the fittest, which involves the rich climbing on the backs of the poor in order to gain dominance. And socialism iw working great in many countries. People in Denmark are the happiest  in the world because of the socialist system. Please, before people like you get brainwashed by the government, OPEN YOUR EYES AND READ, and realize the corruption in politics and our economic system.

oY5ehNXtaa	I agree with previous posts, the numbers of Iraqi deaths are garbage and are overinflated dramatically.  Lancet is by far the highest estimate of iraqi deaths.  It far exceeds the Iraq Body Count Project, U.N. etc.  <br>  <br>  Their methodology has been criticized by many experts and "Gilbert Burnham, the author of the second [Lancet] study, was censured in February 2009 by the American Association for Public Opinion Research for violating its code of professional ethics by refusing to disclose details of his work."<br>  <br>  As far as the cost of the war, remember the bailout that a Democratic Congress passed for banks was $700 Billion!  That is $100 billion more than we spent so far in Iraq!  In just one bill they spent more than Iraq has cost!  This doesn't even count the trillions that have been spent since Obama took office.<br>  <br>  WHAT WAS IT ALL ABOUT?<br>  No one will ever agree on what was the motivating factors or even the primary motivators.  Some will always think Bush created an imaginary threat to make money for "his cronies" or for oil.  Others with insist he just wanted to set Iraq free and protect America.  Maybe the truth is in the middle somewhere.  I believe he believed that Iraq was a worthwhile fight and that it would prevent problems down the road.  It clearly was fraught with problems and mistakes and it will be for us and historians to decide.<br>  <br>  WERE ANY OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED?<br>  Of course!  The same groups that cry about the terrible problems of Tibet, Sudan, and North Korea have largely been mute about the obvious fact that 30 million Iraqis are now largely free.  Even if you accept the grimmest numbers from the Lancet study you have deaths of 2.5% of the total population.  Now 30 million and their future children have an excellent chance to be free!  HOW MUCH PRICE WOULD YOU PUT ON THAT?  <br>  <br>  Further, Saddam is dead.  His sons are dead.  Iraq is not building nuclear weapons, but are allies in the region.  We now have Iran bracketed with Iraq to the West and Afghanistan to the East.  <br>  <br>  WAS IT WORTH IT?<br>  In the short term...NO.  In the long term that hopefully will change.  What if a democratic Iraq puts pressure on Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan, and others to reform, then would it be worth it?  What if through democratizing we prevent numerous wars and stabilize a region where we get a lot of oil?  The long term benefits could prove to make it worth it.<br>  <br>  WHEN WILL IT HAPPEN AGAIN?<br>  There are always plenty of despots and tyrants, but hopefully not for a long time.|`|9rhmeb7raa	As long as you are fond of quoting statistics, you might want to recognize that President Obama's "withdrawal plan" was already laid out in the timetable developed in the U.S.-Iraqi Status of Forces Agreement negotiated by the Bush administration.

The original promise was within six months all US troops would be out; then it became within 16 months, and now it is 18 months and all but 50,000 will be out-pretty easy to keep promises when they change depending on what you do.  The withdrawal he is doing is basically what President Bush negotiated and had been agreed to last year with the exception of that plan called for no more then 20,000 on 1 Jan 2011.  So thirty thousand more troops in Iraq and four months earlier though can't say that because he will be above the presiously discussed number.  He has not kept the promise to have all the troops out within six or even the later sixteen month or does changing the promise after you decide what you are really doing count?  I actually have no big  problem with the figure for the "hundreds of thousands of Iraqi dead" though should give a better number 101,000 200,000 900,000 but also you should break it down to killed by whom and figure out how many might have died any way because Saddam Hussien would have killed them.  The no big problem is not that many died but you can't argue with or correct a vague number like that so won't.  I think the Iraqi people are better off...make that much better of now then they would be if Saddam was still in power and would bet most would agree with that statement.  Even Pelosi and Reid are upset because he is not keeping his promise.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	anybody who includes "hudreds of thousands of dead Iraqis" is a left wing nut job so don't dignify his question with a responce.<br>  <br>  Ultra left wing organizations blame any death that has occured in Iraq since we have been there as being related to the US presence.  i.e. 200,000 old people died because they would have died four weeks later in a crap Iraqi hospital.  That makes their death a US responsibility.<br>  <br>  Edit: Thanks Cecilia!  You've had my back today.  ;)|`|uu3GgopIaa	a. Securing our oil fields<br>  <br>  b.

They are very consistent with their belief that deficit is bad during Democratic administrations and not a concern during Republican administrations. Remember that, in Republican world, Reagan's amazing performance in running up more debt that all other presidents combined was no a concern as deficit has no bearing on the well being of the nation. during the Clinton administration it was important enough that we even needed a constitutional amendment to face this peril. Remember the "balanced budget amendment?" With election of Bush, deficit again became a non issue and had no importance as Bush went about repeating the amazing Reagan performance and again ran up more debt that all presidents before him including Reagan! Now, Democrat....the national debt is killing us. No hypocrisy at all here. Totally in keeping with the Republican denial of responsibility doctrine.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Deficit spending from 2000 to 2006 was equal to HALF of what it soared to from 2006 to 2008 (When Democrats were in control).<br>  <br>  Additionally, the Republican Party from 2004-2008 was full of moderates (i.e. spend like a liberal) and therefore their irresponsible fiscal policies are the same as the current Congress (who has increased the deficit and debt by the largest amount and percent ever).<br>  <br>  Thankfully in the last two election cycles the Republican Party has purged most of the moderates from office and the actual conservatives remain to oppose the continued liberal spending policies of the Democrats.|`|houWY7qvaa	It's called delusional or delusions of grandeur.

He thinks he has the right answers for every thing.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	if so, it's a foolish waste of ones confidence!|`|gfvh5dwTaa	NO.........very few do now|`|6sjphNcPaa	HELL NO!  CNN poll indicated that about 75% are worried. That doesn't sound like "trust" to me.<br>  <br>  It's funny how the democraps are against Obama's plan but the GOP are being supportive.<br>  <br>  Obama's approval rating has tanked ever since he started to actually get to work.  "The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Friday shows that 41% of the nation’s voters now Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing his role as President."<br>  <br>  When you start at 80%, even if it was around 60% - that's a tank in popularity. <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll" rel="nofollow">http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_c...</a><br>  <br>  They also found "73% Trust Judgment of People More Than Politicians" -- how about that, Obama supporters?|`|vlCWp7sSaa	I personally don't like these new stimulus plans. Its not that I don't trust him- I feel like the people who screwed up big time are being praised compared to the people who was laid off.  Then you have the people who actually work hard to keep their job getting taxed to help the people who screwed up big time. This is my opinion- and I bet nobody is going to agree with me.<br>  <br>  People voted for him because he's different. He's not the normal old white president we are used to. People voted for him with no knowledge of what he wanted to do for the country. The band-wagon effect.|`|AA10928202	No. Only the delusional dems and the retarded kool aid drinkers trust an admitted racist socialist that thinks murderers can be negotiated with.|`|6QOKsVaPaa	Trust has to be earned thus far I'm not buying what Obama is selling.  I will give Obama a word of encouragement I see you trying and I'm thankful for that.|`|9bgBIzjFaa	They trust a thief more; at least the thief is honest about his intent to steal|`|YZIqiZEWaa	Im English And I Hate Him I Live In England wanna move to Toronto, Canada.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Yes I do.|`|roAahzkIaa	yep|`|V6uRI7gwaa	I am only one person but I sure don't trust him.  I think he's trying to take away our freedom and turn us from democracy to socialism.  The time is now for true Americans to stand up and tell our government that we are not happy and we want to return to our 1776 government.  With a small federal government and return the power to the people and the states.|`|JV75Iz3eaa	The sucklings at the government teat trust Comrade Obama to take the property of others and give to them.  How sweet.|`|GOpDGnsXaa	No intelligent human Trusts a American Politician or anyone for that matter.<br>  Not me.<br>  I have no idea about the armed forces.|`|LtpNdkPHaa	Hell No  can't trust anyone who has a Marxist Socialist Communist agenda.
ZaadvJAXaa	I asked an Army recruiter this out of curiosity, and I was told 41 years of age.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	You are not too old. You just need to be in good physical condition. Meaning you have no serious medical history. Try talking to a recruiter, they can give you information about which branch would be best for you. I would suggest Army since you are older and it's slightly easier physically than the Marines. In the meantime, get in the best shape you can. Run as often as possible and teach yourself how to drink a lot of water. <br>  <br>  Also, It's spelled Iraq.|`|a59796a93e9118b10a4496b3195421eaaa	You are not too old.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	31 is not too old. It is a little tougher to go in older but a lot of people make it just fine.<br>  <br>  Make sure you are in good physical shape. You will be expected to keep up with 18 year olds.<br>  <br>  If you have a degree, try to find an enlisted job that is related to your degree and once you get citizenship apply for a commission.|`|HFSk25tDaa	no, they raised the age limit to 41, i believe.<br>  you're not too old, make sure you get in shape and research your MOS cause you'll be stuck with it.<br>  also, make sure that you're in it for the right reasons. if you don't have a patriotic American heart, we don't want you serving.<br>  you need to be an American outside of the papers, you know?<br>  <br>  thanks.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	no you are not to old|`|1TBaJjtwaa	Absolutely not.  When I went to Special Forces Assesment and Selection the guys over 30 were performing better than the 20 year olds.  Your maturity is what will help you succeed.  Its not uncommon now adays for men over 30 to join up and be successful.  Just understand and be prepared for the fact that your going to have alot of really young guys in charge of you and making some decisions for you.  Also once you get your citizenship you'll have the option later on while your enlisted to go OCS and become an officer.  But you never know you may find being enlisted satisfying enough for you.  Regardless your gonna be single, you have no kids, you have nothing to lose.  Those are the guys that enjoy the military the most.  Besides that just get in shape and have fun.  Even if you only serve for 3 years you will not regret it.  Good luck to you.|`|7f1TfskEaa	You aren't too old.<br>  Physical conditioning and desire would be the biggest issue.  You will be exercising with teenagers and twenty-somethings, but they are the ones that grew up on video games and are usually out of shape.<br>  <br>  Fort Jackson is the largest post for Basic Training.  There have been a number of statements from the Drill Instructors that older recruits do better.  They are more focused and mature.  As long as they keep up with the physical conditioning, they are frequently put in some leadership positions to mentor the kids.<br>  <br>  Advice:<br>  Talk to a recruiter and find out your options (including bonuses).  Do some running, pushups, and situps to get in shape.  Enlisting may help you get citizenship sooner depending on your situation.|`|u6RvhmqZaa	naw, you're never really too old. as long as you can pass all the fitness tests and such, then go for it. it pays good, and its obviously a secure job as long as you follow all rules and regulations.|`|C62F31Dwaa	nope, your not too old...old man,lol,kidding.
MOALBorJaa	It does depend on the relationship, but you may have grounds for a retrial since the judge should have mentioned the relationship in the beginning and before ruling on any motions. The wisest course would have been for the judge to recuse herself.|`|oVhKGw3Maa	A judge cannot excuse themselves every time a defendant comes into their court and they know them. They do have lives outside just like you and me. It is the intimacy with which the judge is involved with the defendant that would give rise to an exclusion or mistrial. Just because the defendant is the judges motor mechanic will not do it.|`|vrcAP0yYaa	You should appeal and demand a retrial.  You MAY also get some money out of it.|`|GmF4iAFXaa	And the question is...?|`|QlBLZ4tVaa	If the judge knew the defendant personally, she had no business trying the case. Be sure to file an appeal, and include this as one of the reasons why.
AA12041870	Of course they do.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Yes|`|e489c62788059e4428b1a976b978488faa	Through my 15 or so years experience...sometimes, they do...but most of the time they date other Soldiers..usually ones that out Rank them...the Female Soldier that works for me is dating a Civilian, but he is an Ex-Marine...so I don't know if that counts...|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	Women in the military have no restrictions on who they date. What a silly question.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Yep.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	No never. Of course they do!|`|Qo5vSDEdaa	very rarely, because there is only a small percentage of women in the military compared to men, it is basically like puting a few women in a all boys school.......... there is alot of competition for the girl from many men.<br>  <br>  also think of a room full of 100 men and imagine 5 or 10 girls in that room............|`|itdy5FvBaa	yes of course!!! in fact there are many girls in the military that have boyfriends before they entered and they are still with them. it doesnt matter if your in the military or not!|`|K8qAniReaa	Yes.|`|pjYn6PbCaa	Just tell her you have a TAMAHAWK MISSILE!!!|`|V0eH19kiaa	i am now...
CljhO6z9aa	You don't have any proof that he told you not to worry about it, so in that situation it is basically your word against his, and the court is inclined to take his word. From what you have said, the court has definitely treated you with unfathomable disrespect though, and I would file a complaint against the judge and request a change of venue. I would also try to find a lawyer that isn't afraid to stand up to the judge, or see if there are any respectable legal aid firms in the area because all the lawyer fees that you have to pay can and will get very costly, especially with your income. It sounds like in order to have a fair chance at this, you definitely need a new judge and it would be better to get one in a different county/city if that is possible. Many lawyers offer free advice on the first visit, so I would try to find one that offers that and take advantege. A lawyer will be able to tell you how to request a change of venue, or a new judge, or whatever is possible in this situation. I wish you the best of luck in this unfortunate circumstance.|`|85jy4Mt0aa	A judge is require to behave appropriately on the bench.<br>  <br>  If you had an attorney, you would have had more protection, but still the judge/magistrate had an obligation to behave well.<br>  <br>  Report this matter to the Indiana Supreme Court (See "What's your source?" below.)|`|7Wj0KW6Aaa	Wow, that is crazy. I don't think that you can file a complaint against the magistrate because he really didn't do anything illegal. <br>  You should definitely get the custody switched so that you won't be obligated to pay for your son as well as your daughter. If you can get your daughter back in the house, that would be even better so that you don't have any support to pay. I doubt you can go back on the filing date though. My parents had something similar to this with my sister and I. My sister and I were removed from my mother's house by the police and put in our fathers house. My father didn't have legal custody for a few months, but he was still paying a huge amount in child support. My mom said she'd give it all back since we weren't living there, but that she couldn't right then because she needed time to get her budget in order. My dad never saw a penny of it back and there isn't really anything he can do about it.
