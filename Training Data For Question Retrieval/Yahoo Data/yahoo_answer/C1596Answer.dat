5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	TE is called the continuative tense.<br>  <br>  You can use it in several situations.<br>  <br>  When using two verbs, it's the first verb:<br>  <br>  I went to Ginza, and bought shoes.<br>  Ginza de itte, kutsu wo kaimashita/katta.<br>  <br>  Also, using it in progressive speech:<br>  I am writing= Kaite imasu/Kaite iru/Kaiteru. <br>  <br>  There are several uses for it, so it depends on context.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Year of the Rat, "please write you name" is "Kaite kudasa" not "kakite kudasai"  Kakite is a writer or summer season depending on the kanji.|`|MyCGNdOoaa	There are many options to use the -te form.<br>  <br>  I.e. subsequent actions- Depaato ni itte kaimono shimasu<br>  Requests- Mite kudasai<br>  Ongoing actions- Watashi wa yonde imasu<br>  Asking permission to do something- Kisu o shite mo ii desu ka<br>  <br>  etc|`|B2jIiOwnaa	Don't worry!  Understanding "-te" isn't so hard.  One purpose of "-te" is to make commands and requests.  For example:<br>  <br>  1.  Koko ni namae wo kakite kudasai.  --->Please write your name here.<br>  <br>  The "-te" form of a verb can also be used to show a sequence of actions or events.  Kind of like an implied "and".  For example:<br>  <br>  2.  Watashi ha roku-ji ni okite, asagohan wo tabete, kao wo araimashita.  --> I woke at 6 am (and) ate breakfast (and) washed my face.<br>  <br>  Remember, the particles "to" and "ya" mean "and", but can only join nouns! ^_^<br>  <br>  The "-te" form can also be used to express an action that took place at a certain point in time, kind of like the progressive tense in English.  It helps you say things like, "He was reading" or "I will be eating".  But this meaning is only possible if the verb involves an action that can go on and on.  For example:<br>  <br>  3.  Watashi ha mizu wo nonde ita.  -->I was drinking water.  (Sometimes, you can't use "-te".  You have to use "-de".)<br>  <br>  But, the "-te" form can also refer to current states or conditions that were caused by a previous action or event.  In this case, the verb will be noncontinuous.  For example:<br>  <br>  4.   Kurasu ha hajimate imasu.  -->The class has started (or, "The class started and is still going on.")<br>  <br>  Don't let the "ita" and "imasu" confuse you.  They are merely conjugations of the verb "iru".  <br>  <br>  Also, there's no such thing as a "godan" verb.  I think the other commentor made a typo.  As you probably know, there are 3 types of verbs:  Ichidan Verbs, Yodan Verbs, and Irregular Verbs.  <br>  <br>  If you want to know *how* to change verbs from their dictionary forms to ther "-te" form, don't worry.  Just give me "Best Answer" and provide a link to another question.  ^_^  I would explain it here, but I don't want to bore you...and my computer might die.  Don't worry.  It's easy to do.<br>  <br>  P.S.-->Gambatte nasai!|`|zAA5CqsMaa	I learnt this way, based on the ending of the dictionary form of the verb.<br>  u, tsu, ru - tte<br>  mu, bu, nu - nde<br>  ku - ite<br>  gu - ide<br>  su - shite<br>  suru - shite<br>  kuru - kite<br>  <br>  find a room to yourself you can sing it to the tune of "clementine".<br>  <br>  This works for the godan verbs, the ichidan ones you remove the final ru and replace with te.<br>  <br>  This site has more info on verbs: <a href="http://dingjap.blogspot.com/2008/08/jap-jap-jap-lesson-19-te-form.html" rel="nofollow">http://dingjap.blogspot.com/2008/08/jap-...</a><br>  <br>  a little search on google may help you find the song.. i couldn't see it this time.<br>  <br>  I personally now forget the whole godan and ichidan rule thing, but following this rule and using memory will get you through most of the verbs you come against.
zAA5CqsMaa	If possible, I'd say take a trip up to Hokkaido, apparantly it is very nice in the summer. I went in the winter and was happy in the snow, but my host family told me to come in the summer next time because it is nicest.<br>  Sendai is a really nice city too. I got a ferry from Hokkaido to down Sendai which I can recommend if money is an issue.|`|d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	Why not go to Western Honshu?<br>  There are quite a few great sites, and most of them are not as tourist-filled as Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. The most obvious would be Hiroshima. Have you been there? Genbaku Dome and the Peace Museum are well worth visiting. Nearby is Miyajima, home to Itsukushima Shrine, the most photographed shrine in the country. <br>  <br>  Most people visit Hiroshima when they come to the area, but there's much more beyond that. Here are some more places to consider and things to do there:<br>  -Okayama: Korakuen Garden (one of the top 3 in Japan), Okayama Castle, many museums, and tons of historical sites in the Kibiji area, such as Kibitsu Shrine, Saijo Inari, etc.<br>  -Kurashiki: Famous for its large historic district with many local museums. It is also home to the Ohara Museum of Art, which contains a collection of European art that even someone with only limited knowledge about art should be able to recognize MOST of the artists. It's a great museum.<br>  -Takahashi: A former castle town, this city contains Japan's highest castle, Bitchu Takamatsu Castle, which is also one of the least visited of the original castles in the country. Raikyuji Temple has a nice zen garden. You can see most of this city in one day, so it's quite a nice day-trip.<br>  -Akiyoshi-dai (and Akiyoshi-do), the largest plateau and cave in Japan<br>  -Izumo: Izumo Shrine (second holiest of all Shinto Shrines)<br>  -Matsue: Matsu Castle (one of Japan's remaining original castles), world-renowned Adachi Museum of Art (actually not in Matsue but so close, if you go, you can easily do both)<br>  -Iwami Ginzan - an old mine and World Heritage Site (kind of a unique destination in Japan)<br>  -Tottori: Tottori Sand Dunes alone is unique enough to make this visit worthwhile<br>  -Daisen: A mountain with a nice trail featuring Dasenji Temple, nice if you like nature.<br>  <br>  Also, if your travelling to this region from Osaka, and you haven't been to Himeji, it may be worth your time to stop at Himeji on the way for a visit to the famous Himeji Castle.<br>  <br>  With two months, along with Western Honshu, you could do Shikoku:<br>  -Takamatsu: Ritsurin Park (A large and beautiful garden), Yashima Island (site of one of the battles in the Genpei Wars, also has one of the 88 temples of Shikoku's famous pilgrimage route) <br>  -Marugame: Home to one of Japan's original castles.<br>  -Kotohira: Home to Konpirasan, a very famous and popular shrine<br>  -Naruto: Home to the famous whirlpools<br>  -Kochi: Contains one of Japan's 12 remaining original castles<br>  -Matsuyama: Home to one of Japan's original castles (as one of two black castles, it is one of the more unique and well-liked castles)|`|MyCGNdOoaa	Go to the 'Japanese Alps' and stay the night in Tsumago and Magome. You can do some hiking and soak in an onsen. Very interesting and relaxing.|`|jZzYi3MLaa	All people do here in Tokyo is work, eat, drink and drink..Oh, I forgot, they do quite a bit of shopping, too, and sleep on occasion.<br>  <br>  Seriously, check the guidebooks online for activities in Tokyo.

AA10310496	According to this link you cannot take plants or bulbs into Ireland...<br>  <a href="http://goireland.about.com/od/preparingyourtrip/qt/ireland_customs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://goireland.about.com/od/preparingy...</a><br>  <br>  That may refer to tourists though, so if you wanted to do it as a business you would be better off asking the Irish equivalent to DEFRA here in the UK.  A lot of countries can be very touchy about importing stuff such as plants because of the possible transfer of disease and virus in any soil that may be on the plants.  Ireland has already suffered a dreadful catastrophe when it experienced the potato blight...I seriously doubt they would want a repeat of anything like that.|`|GjFCbKRtaa	That all depends on what kind of 'plants' you are talking about.

d8fSVX23aa	I have a place about 50 Min's drive further down the coast to you and use Malaga airport near Estapona. If you are with young children or are an older retired couple do June, it is fresher air and slightly cooler on the evenings, plus it is cheaper on flights and accommodation. If you are young party animals and love the sun, and don't mind hiding in the shade at certain times of the day and the very dry air, (light a hairdryer in your face) go for August but remember you will burn and it is still very hot at night and you will need air con where-ever you are staying. You will get a tan which ever you chose but remember the August tan will probably not last as long because of the sun damage and peeling if you don't use a high factor cream.<br>  <br>  From: Sun lover who spends 7 weeks of the summer there.|`|dmcpdZKlaa	its still boiling and you will get a great tan.....  take sun cream!<br>  <br>  x|`|8KdWHcJdaa	you know what the saying is:<br>  <br>  Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun...........<br>  <br>  it's true 18oC - 26oC is a good temperature to get a tan and have an enjoyable stay here, but when we reach 29oC and above then it really is far too hot to do anything but avoid it.<br>  <br>  Take it from me 29oC and above is horrible, I've seen many many Brits with serious sunburn blisters etc from thinking they need just a little more sun, and August is not the time to lay out and fry.<br>  <br>  Last summer we in the Costa Blanca had 36oC some days!!!<br>  Bring plenty of suncream, drink plenty and from time to time sit in the shade............in 2 weeks you will have a long lasting lovely colour, but if you rush it  you will peel and would have wasted your time.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your stay|`|D2GiPPjTaa	18oC... you can get a Sun tan (in the Sun) but if you're on the beach there will be a cool breaze, it will be HORRIBLE<br>  <br>  29oC is too hot for me to lay in the Sun, I feel too hot. but it is great weather for sitting by the pool|`|wP63CsYCaa	Torremolinos, and the area, I live near, is very hot during summer.<br>  <br>  So, drink liquids, take sun with precaution, and enjoy.
kMK9E2a7aa	The temperature on the Costa del Sol from June to August will be hot. June it will get 28c - 30c+, July is often the hottest month and it can reach 40c, August is often slightly cooler but will still be in the mid 30′s centigrade.<br>  Torremolinos is on the coast and you can get a pleasant sea breeze. If you live in the UK you definitely will notice a difference in temperature. You will have to be very careful in the sun to begin with. So many people come here and get burnt the first day.<br>  I live close by, but inland and the temperature can be hotter.
AA12350023	high scale supermarkets, geant', panda, carrefour, tamimi, you do NOT haggle.... some smaller bakalas, you might get lucky and get the dude to knock off a few halala, but dont expect much there..<br>  its the open markets where you can haggle, like fruit market, fish market, meat markets, you know, those open places..<br>  restaurants are never haggling.. unless its such a tiny place that the owner just knocks off a few.. but most dont haggle. their prices are on the menu or on a board/sign behind them and the price is stuck..<br>  clothing.. depends.. most all large scale malls wont haggle, but these inner city small malls that all have arabic stores, you can probably haggle if the owner is in the store.. also sometimes the clerk will haggle.. YOu cant haggle gasoline.. YOu can haggle street venders<br>  you can always also ask them if they haggle.. you never know..|`|WIEH455laa	Only in traditional souks, gold or jewlery shops.

In the malls and supermarkets of course there is absolutely no haggling bcos it is a supermarket after all. there isnt much haggling in rents etc also bcos if you are coming from the Uk you wuld probably want to live in compounds and its the sellers market here bcos demand for compound space is huge.

Turn around and drive North on the same street and you'll see it.<br>  <br>  You can get great pictures of it from Hollywood & Highland mall.|`|10df4acdc40e62d2abc6ee21093aaa4faa	I agree with the Man.

I contemplated moving to AZ just because I've lived here all my life and rent down there seems to be pretty cheap, but when I posted about it on here I got a bunch of negative remarks. I've never been there but I know that it gets HOT in the summer. Probably TOO hot to be comfortable unless you've lived there your whole life. <br>  Seattle is a great place to live. You have beaches and mountains all within view. The city has some decent nightlife - it has its good bars and clubs just like any other city I imagine.|`|XifazAc5aa	That's easy. SEATTLE. <br>  REASONS:<br>  Denver: looks more like kansas than the rocky mountains; when i first landed there i thought i was on the wrong plane.<br>  Phoenix: wayyy to hot, a lot of old people, and not good scenery.<br>  Seattle: beautiful scenery with the mountains, lakes, puget sound, and all the trees. also, surprisingly is the 2nd youngest (people) city in the us and the people are extremely friendly and outgoing.|`|3L1ifKjaaa	I agree with the previous poster.

TZCzjpGmaa	Ok.......but what is your question then..??|`|YW74O9aNaa	well looks like you've given us a multiple choice question :) The answer is # 2.<br>  Non alignment as a foreign policy was started by Jawaharlal Nehru when he was the prime minister of India. It means that India would not be formally aligned with or against any major powerful nations , at his time they were America and Russia. This was mainly to oppose the cold war between to two. Non alignment also means that from India will not intervene or interference in the internal affairs of another country.|`|0HW0FWFQaa	You need to have a back-ground of inter national politics of the then time first.<br>  USA & USSR were in supreme power position, each trying to grab maximum support. Many of the countries, especially the democratic ones, were naturally aligned to USA. While many of the under-developed countries were supporting USSR in the fake wave of communism as the means to grow faster.<br>  Kashmir being close to USSR, USA wanted India to ally with them but wise Nehru maintained friendship with both vut remained un-attached to either one. This is non-alignment.

There's a bus running between the two.<br>  <br>  You might find this site useful for information on Capri - there's a map showing the locations of various places and a lot of good information. <a href="http://www.capri.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.capri.net/</a>
YW74O9aNaa	no its not! <br>  Indians won't openly do it of course. <br>  But if you're foreigners just visiting India then it shouldn't really matter... people really don't care if its tourists.. if its someone they know then its entirely different reaction!<br>  Anyway no one asks for a marriage certificate before booking a hotel room :D|`|lEXTHOZPaa	Yes of course.|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	First there is a question about couple which is unmarried. There is no concept in India where couple can be called unmarried. Staying in hotel in India is not a big problem provided your intention to visit India is purely study or tourist.
AA11496012	Even though a long flight such as Sydney to Los Angeles is mostly over water, if there is an emergency that can be controlled by the pilot, they can find an airport possibly in one of the islands in the South Pacific such as Tahiti or try to fly to Hawaii.  If it is complete failure and the pilot cannot control the aircraft, then there is a good chance no one will survive anyway.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Typically when a big jumbo jet goes down, its all over. The only times people surive plane crashes are when they occur right around take or or landing. <br>  <br>  If a plane that big goes down over water its addios for everyone anyway. <br>  <br>  In the history of avaiation, only a few major large airlines have gone down in mid flight anyway. Typically if something happens its within 15 mins of take or landings.|`|AA00000203	Most planes that fly across Pacific or Atlantic make it safely to destination. In fact, the most dangerous times during a flight are at take-off and landing, which would be close to the airports, and emergency crew.<br>  <br>  In the unlikely event of troubles mid-fligt over the ocean, the pilot can attempt a controlled water-landing similar to what happened on Hudson river. Passengers would then similarly exit and use floatation devices as well as the plane's detachable floatation raft.  There are enough commercial ships criss-crossing the oceans that they can do emergency pick ups. The ships would be notified of the emergency by nearest control towers that track a plane's flight path.  I have to repeat, such scenario is very unlikely to happen, nonetheless, there are safety procedures and trainings in place to handle such emergency.|`|JEMtVVkBaa	well you either end up on an island like on Lost<br>  <br>  but I think that most flights try to stay within 30 minutes of somewhere to touch down. Now of course, this is not always possible. But the aircraft will always try to be as close to somewhere to land as possible in case soemthing does go wrong.<br>  <br>  In most air emergencies - even over the ocean, the aircraft is on the ground within 20-30 minutes; weather its landed safetly or not is another question.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	well all flights are under air traffic control and usually there is some land within 2 hours of any location<br>  it doesnt total fly over the ocean either<br>  most plane fly a great circle route (not direct)<br>  and if there is an emergency you got New Zealand SAR and other<br>  the US coast guard and other air rescue services and and many freighters ply those ocean all will respond to an airline plane crash in the ocean
j8XFGoLFaa	Yes they do, but since it's an American store, "APPLE", they will be a bit more expensive.<br>  <br>  *EDIT*<br>  Hey, so I called my sister in El Salvador, asked her about the iPODs... they're sold there, but try looking for it in San Salvador, the capital. They're pricey, just like any APPLE product. Oh, and that guy who mentioned there's no electricity, is wrong. People in El Salvador have electricity, but they are just not willing to get an expensive "little" item if it won't benefit the household.

UAMtRFruaa	Put it on your credit card and pay it off in time.|`|kr6W1Bb6aa	You should never get credit for a vacation because you should never have to pay interest for something you will not own. Yea you will get a few good memories but the second you get home the only thing you and your new Husband have is a credit bill each month... I assume you are asking this because you cannot afford a honeymoon at the moment, thats a good indicator that you should really look into cheaper locations at the moment. Cheapcarribean.com has some really good deals for low budget honeymoons. Any website that will offer payment plans knows you are desperate and will likely charge 20% APR on any purchase. If you saw a hotel that is normally priced for $299 a night all of a sudden become $600 a night? likely not and that is what it will look like if it takes you a few years to pay off... take a little trip now and in a few years take a great cheap, just make sure to pay it full before you go. I hope you have a great time and great life, best of luck to you

They are overpriced and can be quite lame. You end up waiting forever to get it, and they pay a fortune. You will have more fun, and meet more laid back girls just at regular bars. Try Carnival Court at Harrahs. Live music and great food. Honestly, its alot easier to get laid at places like that, then at the clubs. Club girls think they above everyone but celebs.<br>  <br>  O sheas casino can be alot of fun. Very cheap drinks, low minimums, beer pong for money. Its a fun and wild environment full of young people.<br>  <br>  The best pool scene if probably at Hard Rock, but in general all of them are great on the strip. Late march/Erly April can still be a tad dicey as far as weather though. So its hard to tell for sure how the pool scene will be.|`|puyAEPZyaa	Depending on what you are feeling up to, here are my recommendations:<br>  <br>  Eating - Wynn's Buffet, Bellagio's Buffet, Nine Steakhouse at Palms, or MIX at Mandalay Bay<br>  <br>  Dessert - The Pastry Shop or the Crepe Shop at Paris, the Chocolate Shop at Wynn, the Chocolate Shop at Bellagio, or the Chocolate Shop at Caesars Palace<br>  <br>  Shopping - Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, Grand Canal Shoppes at Venetian, and Fashion Show Mall<br>  <br>  Shows - Cirque du Soleil "O" at Bellagio, Cirque du Soleil "Believe" at Luxor, or Blue Man Group at Venetian<br>  <br>  Clubs: PURE at Caesars Palace, Rain or the Ghostbar at Palms, and Tao at Venetian<br>  <br>  Other things - Madame Tussauds Wax Museum at Venetian, the Coke and M&M Stores, and the newly redone Volcano Eruption at Mirage<br>  <br>  Sightseeing - Take a trip to the top of the Stratosphere or to the top of the Eiffel Tower at Paris (try and time it on the hour so you can watch the bellagio fountains go off while you are at the top)<br>  <br>  Spas - Canyon Ranch Spa at Venetian or Qua Baths and Spa at Caesars Palace<br>  <br>  Las Vegas has unlimited opportunities for fun and excitement, so you might just want to explore the Strip and try anything that looks appealing as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you enjoy your trip!|`|yvPA8FSsaa	You will not find any $2 limit on the Strip.  You may find a $5 dollar limit during the day but $10 is much more likely at night.  The night clubs are extremely expensive and are filled with posers.  Depending on what you are into, they may not be much fun.  But, Coyote Ugly inside New York-New York is usually jumping.<br>  <br>  Here is something you might try.  In some hotels that have these clubs, there are stands along the way that sell frozen fruit flavored alcoholic beverages.  If you scope a place out you will see that groups of girls dressed in their club outfits will often stop on the way to these clubs and consume several of these drinks before continuing to the clubs.  <br>  <br>  If I were young and single, I would stalk my prey at these watering holes.  Especially looking for the girls who are obviously from the Mid-West, dressed too sexy and have bought into the whole "What happens n Vegas stays in Vegas" bit.  If you have some personality and can make an immediate good impression, well, it could take you a long way.<br>  <br>  Girls downing these drinks to get buzzed before going to the clubs are most likely looking to have fun.  If I were single, I would make it my business to see to it that they do just that.<br>  <br>  *|`|KGgPtU8zaa	My husband and I were looking for smaller minimums and the cheapest we found anywhere was $3. <br>  <br>  One fun thing I suggest is going downtown to freemont street. you can get there if you take the deuce bus. it runs 24/7 up and down the strip and down to the downtown.

Advise your daughter's gran to see if she still has the receipt from the posted item and to take it into the post office where the item was lodged. Most likely she will then be asked to fill in a missing article form, which will then be forwarded on to the Dead Letter Office (Or Irish Equivalent) who will launch an investigation.<br>  <br>  Be warned, lots of things can go wrong when parcels are mailed from one country to another.

TdROahUnaa	Last question first.<br>  <br>  NOWHERE will you find bras in Japan that big. I have a way smaller bra size than you do and I can't find bras here that aren't padded.<br>  <br>  Also about hte people. It really does depend where you go. I don't think Japan is completely racist, but the older generation will usually give any foreiners a miss. The younger generation is totally open to anything. <br>  <br>  The fact that you have light skin and black hair means  they will probably think you are Japanese and from Hawaii.<br>  <br>  BTW I can't find anything here to wear. I'm not fat but Japanese people are soooooo slender. All my jackets I bought here are way too tight around the shoulders nevermind anything that has to go around the waist.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh and the old people (usually men) just ignore foreigners. In my experience tho the old ladies are too cute. They have these big grins and crinkley faces and are soo sweet. Beware that in small towns they do talk about you. And stare... but then again I'm blond and blue eyed. yes you will get a lot of attention because you may look japanese but you have BLUE EYES!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  have fun!<br>  <br>  =^.^=|`|qpX0KAAsaa	To the Japanese, you'll be just another foreigner.

I had one classmate he's mother was mixed so he looked mixed too but nobody actually cared. People often asked me If I was half though, but nothing else like racist stuff. I won't say Japan don't have any racism but at least I was fine and I had lots of friends.|`|15QLqt0haa	99% of Japanese don't have a sense of discrimination or race. Because such sense is not daily issue in Japan.  <br>  However, some people might give wrong impression to non Japanese speakers because they are shy and cannot speak English even a word.<br>  <br>  Take it easy.   <br>  We don't judge you how you look !!!<br>  You will be fine in Japan!!<br>  <br>  BTW, "GANGRO"  has been extinct already. and "BIHAKU" is not as extreme as it used to be.

But, I don't think they sell bras that big.|`|K1TR1GNQaa	im kinda tierd of people stereotyping japan as a racist country. no body will judge you by your skin color. im half american and half japanese and when i used to live in japan it was the best place ive been. after i moved to america last year, every time i go to school every body calls me "the japanese kid", "jap", "asian guy" look whos racist. people like you need to understand that before you judge other countries as racists think about your own country.|`|lWtazRzZaa	I don't know what to say. I'm half japanese and half american(Caucasian). But I'm not having any problems.(I did though) But I'm basically white, so your case might be slightly different. It's true that Japan is sort of a xenophobic country. It's not that they dislike foreigners, it's that they're just not used to them. When my teacher once came across a black man for the first time in his life when he was like 50, he said he was frightened. So, there are people like that.<br>   At first people would show no superficial racism but probably won't consider you as one of their own. But that's just talking about the initial part. Once you learn how to speak japanese and learn the customs  everything would probably become easier. What I think is crucial is language and culture.<br>   In japan the darker your skin color is the more you stand out. That isn't good in Japanese culture. Japanese like to be average. And don't consider doing the ganguro thing cause that's usually considered weird.<br>  <br>  I apologize if I have offended anyone. Not intentional..

yapwoKtyaa	Are you by any chance American??    1) All of these countries are citizens of McWorld and host the usual multinational outlets.. France has a chain called Quick which is a French only fast food chain and they also have a chain called Buffalo Grill on their Motorways (never been in them so I don't know what they're like). I don't think the other countries have 'native' fast food chains but I could be wrong.    2) The first three countries listed and Greece all have superb cuisine and take their food very seriously. Never been to Russia but from the outside looking in it seems to be functional rustic affair (read lots of goulash and dumplings and sower-kraut). Ditto Germany but of course they're also famous for their Frankfurters.    3) I know France and Germany have excellent public school systems and both countries top the States in the literacy tables. Spain and Italy are slightly poorer countries but still have reasonable public schools (I think). Greece being the poorest country on the list will probably have less adequate public education. All of the countries have excellent universities, though maybe the creme de la creme of European universities can't match the top Anglo-American universities [Oxbridge, Yale, Harvard, etc] in the prestige stakes.    4) Well if you're just going over as a tourist, being only a guest of the country and pumping tourist dollars into their economies then you shouldn't have too much to worry about. Though there is inevitably a little bit of yankee-phobia in these countries as a tourist you won't be on the receiving end of anything more than the occasional snide remark. At worst. However most people know the difference between a person from a country and a persons government. Since the reign of W Bush has ended Americas standing in the world has gone up a notch or three anyway. Regarding immigration, this is a very thorny complex issue. It's a sad fact of life that people living in a part of the world they're not officially from struggle to integrate and be accepted by their often reluctant hosts. In recent years, a lot of these countries have experienced a significant influx in economic migrants from Eastern Europe and elsewhere. This has caused tension as the locals see them as taking jobs that should rightfully be theirs and putting unnecessary strain on public services. The recent economic turmoil and spiraling unemployment rates has strained tensions further. France also has problems with migrants from it's former colonies. They have never really been accepted into French society are often found living as second class citizens in public housing schemes on the outskirts of the larger French towns. The official statistics also bear this out with unemployment rates for French of African decent four times higher than the national average. In the poorer eastern part of Germany which is still struggling to shake off its soviet legacy, neo-nazism has become fairly prolific. In fact all of these countries have fairly strong far-right political parties. However it has to be said America has also been scarred by a long, dark history of institutionalized racism and segregation that it still hasn't successfully managed to shrug off even with the election of it's first black president (many southern whites american rednecks are openly racist and even in the more liberal states blacks are still five times more likely to be arrested for smoking marijuana than whites).    5) All these countries are democratic.    6) Whilst on the whole European society is more secular than America, religion still plays an important role in all these countries. In Russia the orthodox church is probably the most influential institution outside the Kremlin. Italy is heavily Catholic and the pope sits in the vatican (technically in a separate country but for practical purposes lets say the pope sits in Rome). The Greeks are also quite Christian (greek Orthodox), especially in the more rural areas. Ditto with Spain (Catholic). Germany on the whole is fairly secular but parts of the country are still fairly religious. France is the most secular of the countries listed but is still a Catholic country and the beautiful city of Paris is home of two magnificent cathedrals.    Whew!    PS, If you're thinking of traveling round Europe, buy a Lonely Planet guidebook or three as they will be more informative than any Yahoo Answers post could ever dream of being.    Realized I haven't spoken about Holland at all. Holland has it's fair share of migrants that live relatively peacefully with each other. Has decent public education. Not that religious but you can still find a church or three. Not really famous for food other than its cheese [and it's 'special' brownies :-)] but probably scrubs up OK cuisine wise.

Or Jealousy. Jealousy of what the other country has. Maybe a higher economy rate, or a richer culture, or something. <br>  <br>  Or maybe because the country they're going to war with (Or is already in war with) did something really bad to their country. There's many great reasons as to why 2 countries would go to war together. But to me, I'm going to choose 2. <br>  <br>  1. Because they want to invade the other country or want their land.<br>  2. Because the other country did something to their country that no one liked, and they want to kill them. <br>  <br>  And another one might be because they need something from that country, like America needs oil, and stuff and all of that stuff is in Iran, Iraq, and so on, and I think we're still in war with them, so yeah.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Their claim to their right of their territories!|`|T1iVHHsGaa	greed|`|svfBYHFfaa	them greatest reason is about the control of resources the japs went to war because them bloody brits and yankees tried to control oil in the middle east....YES ITS ALL BECAUSE OF POWER and still is like why are them yankees in iraq POWER MAN POWER|`|Kj2wOni9aa	In the Middle East, it was Bush.

Intrinsic anti-Israel bias - or a high degree of gullibility to manipulative international media coverage? <br>  <br>  Put another way, do you have to be anti-Israel to believe Palestinian lies, or is Palestinian mendacity so well-constructed, so plausible, and so well disseminated by collaborative media outlets like Al Jazeera that even well-meaning people can't help but believe the worst of Israel? <br>  <br>  These questions are prompted by some significant reporting in Monday's Jerusalem Post ("Int'l community was duped by Hamas's false civilian death toll figures, IDF claims"). <br>  <br>  Even well-regarded Palestinian pressure groups have been claiming that Israel killed 895 civilians in the Gaza fighting. Operating on the basis of such "data," coupled with a poisoned wellspring of antipathy against the Jewish state, Mahmoud Abbas has been making the case for indicting Israeli cabinet ministers and military officers for international war crimes. <br>  <br>  Pro-Palestinian campaigners allege that two-thirds of the Arab fatalities were civilian. The IDF insists that no more than a third of the dead were civilians - and not a one was targeted intentionally. So instead of "1,300 killed, most of them civilians," we now have reason to believe, based on the IDF's methodical analysis of 1,200 of the Palestinian fatalities thus far identified by name, that 580 were combatants and 300 non-combatants. <br>  <br>  Of these 300, two were female suicide bombers, and some others were related to terrorists such as Nizar Rayyan, a top Hamas gunman who insisted that his family join him in the hereafter. <br>  <br>  "The first casualty when war comes is truth," said US senator Hiram Warren Johnson. <br>  <br>  Take, for instance, Arab eyewitness accounts of the number killed at the Jabalya UN School on January 6 - some 40 dead, maybe 15 of them women and children. The IDF says the actual figure is 12 killed, nine of them Hamas operatives. <br>  <br>  With time, perhaps, the names and true identities of each and every one of the Gaza dead - including the 320 as yet unclassified - will be determined. <br>  <br>  One point is indisputable: Despite the best efforts of both sides, the IDF wound up killing more Palestinians unintentionally than the Palestinians killed Israeli civilians on purpose. This is known as "disproportionality." <br>  <br>  Israeli officials, given bitter experiences such as Jenin in 2002, when a grossly false narrative of massacre and massed killing was disseminated by Palestinian officials, should have long since internalized the imperative to try to ascertain the number and nature of Palestinian dead in real time. <br>  <br>  But while the figure "1,300 Palestinians killed, most/many of them civilians" is now embedded in the public consciousness, it is emphatically not too late to try to set the record straight. <br>  <br>  Atrocity stories are nothing new. The British have been charged with using them to create popular outrage during the Boer War. The allies used them against Germany during World War I - which, incidentally, allowed the real Nazi atrocities during WWII to be dismissed long into the Holocaust. <br>  <br>  Nowadays, it matters what masses of uninformed or ill-informed people far removed from the Arab-Israel conflict think. Dry statistics released so belatedly will win Israel no PR credit in a world of 24/7 satellite news channels and real-time blogging. Nevertheless, the fact that an Israeli narrative is finally out there is significant. Perhaps responsible news outlets will want to reexamine some of their original reporting, along with the assumption that "most" of the dead were non-combatants. <br>  <br>  Palestinian propaganda is insidious because those being manipulated are oblivious to what is happening. Chaotic images of casualties being hurried to hospitals, gut-wrenching funerals and swaths of shattered buildings create an overarching "reality." Against this, Israel's pleadings that the Palestinians are culpable for the destruction, and that the above images lack context, scarcely resonate. <br>  <br>  Despite six decades of intransigence and a virtual copyright on airline hijackings and suicide bombings, the Palestinians have created a popular "brand" for themselves by parlaying their self-inflicted victimization into a battering ram against Israel. <br>  <br>  Disseminators of news should have learned better than to take Palestinian death-toll claims at face value, least of all when sourced directly or indirectly from the Hamas-run government of Gaza.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi.

This was discussed extensively in the hadith: We have met people who love death as much as we love life."

It's almost as if there's the notion that if they can get here, it's such a great place, they'll stay," said Chris Robinson.<br>  <br>  Immigration isn't a permanent phenomenon and Canada needs to approach it as a firm would approach retaining an employee, he said. "We don't want to take it as a given that just because somebody's come here that they're going to stay."<br>  <br>  One-third of young male immigrants leave Canada within 20 years of arriving and more than 60 per cent of those who leave do so in the first year, according to Return and Onward Migration among Working Age Men, a recent Statistics Canada report co-authored by Robinson.<br>  <br>  The report, a study of male immigrants aged 25 to 45 at the time they arrived in Canada, found that over the past two decades business professionals and skilled workers, the most desirable immigrants, are the most likely to leave, with 40 per cent of them leaving the country within 5 years of arrival.<br>  <br>  Because there are no exit interviews when an immigrant leaves Canada, the study made inferences about why they left based on landing records, census data and income tax filings. Immigrants who arrived during poor economic climates (in 1980 and 1990) were more likely to leave than those who arrived during boom times (1986 and 1996). Therefore, it's likely immigrants are leaving for better opportunities elsewhere, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  The best way to keep these immigrants is to ensure they get jobs that match their skills and experiences, said the director of operations at the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council.<br>  <br>  "We know that good employment is the number one indicator of successful integration for immigrants," said Elizabeth McIsaac. "A key element in all this is having employers involved in the development of programs that are intended to bring immigrants into the labour market."<br>  <br>  One such program is Toronto's Career Bridge, a non-profit internship program that matches qualified immigrants with appropriate jobs. Since the program started three years ago, 270 immigrants have found full-time work in their fields, but there are still 1,500 skilled immigrants, more than half with university degrees, on the waiting list. So far only 115 of the city's 2,760 businesses with more than 100 employees have signed up for the program.<br>  <br>  HR professionals need to begin looking at international credentials and education as an asset, said McIsaac. There are tools available to help HR understand international credentials and agencies that can connect employers with immigrants, so employers have no excuse not to consider immigrants for job openings, she said.<br>  <br>  "Once you begin to have more experience working with immigrant communities, it becomes a lot easier and you can do it a lot better," she said.<br>  <br>  If Canadian employers aren't willing to take advantage of these immigrants, the Statistics Canada report proves they'll go elsewhere to find jobs, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  "If a better opportunity comes up somewhere else and it happens to come up across an international border, then they're quite likely to move," he said.<br>  <br>  Over the next 10 years, immigration will represent all of the growth in Canada's workforce because there simply won't be enough young Canadians to replace retiring baby boomers. However, Canada isn't the only country facing a looming labour shortage and other countries that haven't typically gone after immigrants, such as Japan and India, are now doing so, said McIsaac.<br>  <br>  "We are in a global economy and we are competing for a high level of talent in other countries," she said. "We have to do a better job of receiving that talent
E855dvZdaa	This is actually the second time something like this has happened. Although the first time there were a big court case, the child's life was not in absolute immediate danger although the trail was held fast since it was an emergency. <br>  <br>  In my opinion one can see it from two sides, Yes religion is very important and they feel that it is God's will and God give life and God can take it away. In my opinion they have a point BUT God also created medicine, hospitals, technology, etc. and I am sure that he would want us to use it. In the end if it works or not is still in God's hands.<br>  <br>  I also know that here in South Africa, the high court is the upper guardian of all children. Therefore, it has to fight for the rights of the children. If a parent could do just what they want with there children a lot of other laws would be useless as well. Children need to be protected. A parent should not have absolute say over what happens to there child, specially when it is not in the child's best intrest.<br>  <br>  The right to life and the right to religion is both fundamental rights in Chapter 2 of the South African Constitution.  And although and first glance one would say that the right to life must be more important that is not always the case. Just think back to the Abortion case. Abortion was deemed constitutional even though the life of a unborn child would be taken. However, this child is unborn, and according to our law has no rights. <br>  <br>  I think in this case, the court made a good judgement and I cant say the parents was selfish, but they were not thinking clearly.|`|lppt4Op7aa	Not necessarily, It all depends what your believes are.

The scenario underlying the question is what is known as a 'false fallacy dilemma' or 'either/or fallacy.'  The strong implication is that there are only two options here, when in fact there are others.  Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions make up a very famous false fallacy dilemma:  get a blood transfusion or die.  Such, however, is never the case.  There are always options other than a blood transfusion.  These parents did not choose their religion over their child's life.  If they lacked concern for their child's life, they would not be seeking medical attention in the first place, isn't that so?  <br>  <br>  But even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the parents chose 'religion' over someone's life, what would be the problem?  Put another way:  Jesus told his followers that if they did not love him above all else, they were not worthy of him.  Loving him means obeying his commandments and teachings.  To claim to be faithful to God until and unless a dilemma comes up is no faith at all.  That is what Satan claimed about Job.  Recall?  Satan said Job only worshiped God for what he could get out of it but if push came to shove – specifically his own skin – Job would fold like a proverbial deck of cards.  Job would choose to save his skin rather than be faithful to God.  It is no different today.  <br>  <br>  It is the Bible that commands worshipers to 'abstain from blood.'  That includes blood transfusions.  Every medical treatment can be done without the use of blood transfusions.<br>  <br>  The parents are not selfish.  They are wise, discreet, and faithful to God's commandments.<br>  <br>  Hannah J Paul|`|UlQEgJrDaa	The South African government, should be  trying to stop the crime,and not waste time in interfering in issues they know nothing about, Doctors have other ways of treating people, without giving blood transfusions, in fact blood is often used when its not always necessary. Blood transfusions have also killed people,when the blood is infected or comtaminated, so its not always a saving grace.I wonder if the South African government, would be held responsible if the child died of Aids or the like, if it was found that the blood they insisted upon, being given was indeed infected.....I doubt it!!<br>   Its a typical example of a government abusing its ''power'', <br>  You too should not condemn something you don't understand.!|`|moF46oZYaa	Not selfish, just ridiculously indoctrinated (brainwashed). I know a Jehovah's Witness, this sect has a tremendous hold on peoples lives and minds.<br>  <br>  In their minds they ARE doing the right thing for their child by refusing the transfusion by keeping to what they believe are god's orders.<br>  <br>  Blame the Shepherd, not the blinded sheep. It's good the government stepped in, this child's life is at risk and the doctrine from some cult is standing in the way of the necessary treatment. This can't be allowed.<br>  <br>  Edit: Read sourskittles86 answer thoroughly especially paragraphs 7 and 8.<br>  I quote: 'Losing them now and being faithful is a small price to pay for the guarantee of them coming back and being able to see them again.'<br>  <br>  What she is basically saying is they believe if they keep to their doctrine they will be guaranteed an afterlife.<br>  <br>  Herein lies the problem, the child needed the blood transfusion, but they would rather keep to the doctrine and have the child die than forfeit the chance of an afterlife.<br>  <br>  If an adult wants to play with their own life, fine, but this is a minor and children are vulnerable to pressure, it's the courts responsibility to protect them from their parents as well as themselves and this was a life threatening decision.<br>  <br>  I'm just pleased they passed it in time and this 12 year old girl's life was saved.|`|hfigZbx5aa	I don't think government should be separate from religion in all cases. Part of that child's identity is religion. I had a friend that was a Jehova's Witness who was taken by the state as a child for cancer treatment and she later killed herself because she couldn't stand the fact that she had been "violated" in her mind. Not to mention the fact that her parents wouldn't take her back because she had been treated. There are a lot of reasons they do things the way they do in religion. Some don't make sense, that's why it's a FAITH and not a SCIENCE. Like someone said, the parents are trying to make the best choice for their child in a bad situation with what they know and believe to be true. What right do outsiders have to impede it? Unless they have scientific evidence that disproves God, then they have to accept that some people will fear punishment from God more than they do death. It's their choice, let them have it.<br>  <br>  Chris S- I'd like to point out that the publication you posted was from 1990 and many of the quotations in THAT even were from the early 80s. Believe it or not, science HAS progressed since then. Yes, there's te occasional slip in the system, but all systems have fallacies. And even WITH those statistics, more lives are helped than hindered. And, honestly, I'd rather live with hepatitis than not live at all. Personal preference, thankyouverymuch.|`|t1zWa5vHaa	Well, let's put it this way, every person has the right to their own opinions, beliefs and religion of their choice - as stated in our own constitution. Enough said.|`|G1hQZuaiaa	I don't think people should interfere with the religious beliefs of anyone, no matter how bizarre. South Africa is pretty fcuked up, but we have always been very tolerant of each other when it comes to religion. What is next on your agenda, calling for the arrest of traditional healers because they selling fake drugs, how about harassing muslims for the noise pollution they cause when praying.|`|nR5tytgjaa	Oh I have heard this story a thousand times before! Refusing access to a blood transfusion does not automatically mean the opposite is death!<br>  <br>  But I would like to know why the Jehovah's Wintnesses...after ALL this time ...haven't bothered to put something in place that will enable THEIR people to receive PURE blood!  In other words...why don't they create a system whereby they are registered and prepared to donate or accept blood from one another?|`|lDJWOEQSaa	This is the time to sit down and for once rethink what laws where created by the ANC government who could not think longer than their noses are ! We are supposed to have freedom of religion yet the law is allowed to rob you from it ! I do not agree with Jehovah's witnesses at all but you still have to respect the peoples choice . Rather allow the child to choose for himself ! If a girl of 12 can legally give permission for a abortion without the need for parental consent ,why can't a kid legally decide to a blood transfusion ? Weird ! And only in S.A !<br>  What is next ? A court order to keep parents from having their sons circumcised ? They are opening Pandora's box with this court ruling . I am very sure the ruling will be reversed soon by constitutional court .|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	I personally am not a witness i do know some though, they actually have a certain medication that actually creates blood. So instead of using other peoples blood they use this medication. But as i said i dont believe it.<br>  <br>  EDIT Ayiza so its fine that they must get rid of religeon but then in a culture that you can have many wives and sacrifice and torture a bull is fine? Please man! If people have religeons they can and if people have there culture thats fine as well but dont just justify your culture and think other peoples religeons are bad.|`|5aqYVyvAaa	There are several places in the Bible that tells us to ABSTAIN from blood. Gen 9:4,16; Lev 17:10 Lev 17:4; Le &:26-27; Ac 15:28-29; Ac 21:25.<br>  <br>  There are also scriptures that say saving a life does not justify breaking this law. Mark 8:35-36<br>  <br>  Blood is considered a creatures life force; so abstaining from it is showing respect for that life before God. That is why we don't accept transfusions from whole blood or blood fractions. However, some fractions when broken down enough aren't considered blood anymore (such as what is used in anti venom and other shots that prevent diseases like anthrax (You can also use some plant based cells in place of plasma etc. that kind of thing).<br>  <br>  Your blood is made up of more things than just blood cells; there other cells and matter that make up your blood that are found in other parts of your body so we use our conscious our guide. Either way it's up to her own conscious what he or she wants to do on matters such as this. Each of us have to make an accounting to God. But whole blood and blood fractions a definite no.<br>  <br>  Blood transfusions is a doctor's easy way out. I'm sorry if I offended anyone but it's true. They have to work much harder to find an alternative treatment and be more careful administering that treatment than to say just give them blood due to a sloppy surgery and go on to the next person. (Medical professionals have admitted to this)<br>  <br>  Some people have lived taking blood yes. But they fail to mention the many many people who have died from infections and have contracted AIDS by taking blood.<br>  <br>  Doctors have said that patients who don't take blood heal better and faster that patients who do. The scripture in the book of Acts is true we obey God's commandments. God says don't take blood. If we don't and one of our love ones die Jesus PROMISES us at Acts 17:31 that he GUARANTEES a resurrection to see them again if we obey him which includes not taking blood.<br>  <br>  Think about: it if we let our children take blood and they still happen die. They will get resurrected Jesus said so. But we as the parents might not be there to see them to come back for we have sinned in making that decision to let them take the blood. Losing them now and being faithful is a small price to pay for the guarantee of them coming back and being able to see them again.<br>  <br>  There is so much available now that bloodless medicine has been considered the golden treatment. More people than ever are refusing blood and not all of them are JWs. There's the cell saver, hemodilusion (sorry can't spell), fibren glue, and irithro-poyitien just to name a few.<br>  <br>  Either way we desire good treatment or we wouldn't got to the doctor. We also have the right to refute treatment. But I hope this brings a little light to people that we are not crazy. We have changed the medicine world for the better due to our Bible based beliefs.<br>  <br>  However, I'm not sure how the laws work in South Africa if the parents wanted to refuse treatment. I'll definitely check it out tho.<br>  <br>  I got sick when I was 4years old. The doctors wanted to give me radiation treatment and my parents refused cause it could have killed me. Was that selfish of my parents? I'm alive today without it. People have died taking blood. Doctors can do bloodless treatments. It's not selfish at all.|`|2UomwjfEaa	Yes the parents were selfish.

AA11013113	Use the Metro Line to North Greenwich.    Great trains to catch.<br>  When you arrive at N. Greenwich, go over the bridge, straight into the Exhib. centre.   It is vast.   For refreshments - avoid Costa, Starbucks etc. etc.   Rip off prices.   Go further in - worth the walk - get Lazells Coffee,  95p.

5n3Wm0LGaa	Well, I have the same question you do.    My father passed away Monday, and a last minute flight to my mom is too expensive. Due to the weather they are having up there, I can't even fly in until tomorrow.    A good friend of mine said his sister uses this airline all of the time, so he suggested it.    So we booked a flight for me to leave tomorrow, and under the circumstances, I am hoping everything goes smoothly.    Email me in a few days and I'll let you know how it goes!|`|PSiNv7gUaa	You hear mixed things about Allegiant, but I was completely satisfied with my flight with them.  There is no in-flight entertainment, you have to pay for all drinks and snacks and the seats don't recline, but that's what keeps this a low-fare airline (and with flights as short as Allegiant flights are, all you really need is a good book).    The flight attendants were very nice and made it a point to check on me periodically (it was my first time flying and I was pretty nervous).  They made me feel very comfortable and secure, and I was actually able to enjoy the flight.  Just make sure that if you book a flight with them that you can definitely go, because if you cancel they will not refund you the money, they will simply give you credit toward a future flight with them.  Try to avoid calling their customer service line unless you absolutely have to as the wait time on phone calls can be quite long.  All in all, it was a great flight, and I will definitely fly with them again.|`|p8UAIAisaa	I have not heard any negative things about them. Check in times are a little weird and they charge for baggage and seats, which is much like Ryan air over in Europe. The are not ARC, meaning if they should go bankrupt and cease flying you are basically SOL.. as no other airline will accept their tickets. If you do decide to fly them, make sure you purchase your tickets with a credit card, that way you can atleast dispute the charge if they should stop flying.

Jze8cXzqaa	Most likely you will be going Nueva Ocotepeque' (border) via Santa Rosa de Copan (beautiful) from San Pedro Sula (hot-ugly). The greatest danger is from SPC Airport to and in SPC, it's been this way for over 20 years. Overall the highway is good but they've had heavy rains the past year so expect 'Car Consuming' pot holes and if you have traveled in this Region, they have some new large 140 klm (100 mph) buses "Earnhardt" equals .. to a burro pulling a load of wood (4-5 mph) "STAY ALERT" an You won't get hurt. 'Crime'? Being alert does little, try to always have someone with you, two Nortenos and a local (you trust/pay) is the best insurance goin. Any Top Professional deserves respect, these 'Thugs' are the best. My Hat is Off to Them, Safe Travels - It's beautiful country & people.|`|03sLrNPCaa	Honduras and El Salvador border one another so an answer to distance, time and road types depends on which road, and where in Honduras to where in El Salvador.  Safety also depends on which route you take and there are no rest stops such as you see on the interstates in the US.  Weather?  Take your pick.  Why don't you refine your question a bit and try again?
J3uudQobaa	best place to go is Destin, FL.    Three friends and I, like you all, wanted to do a senior roadtrip and went there. We each chipped in to buy a small condo right on the beach. Wasn't too pricy, and the area is really beautiful. They got tons of shopping (the two girls wanted so badly), cute restaurants (one is world famous and reallly cool), and go-kart/carnival places nearby (for dates n such). The place is usually crowded with other high school and college students. Everything is literally right next to the beach so its that what you want but for a better deal than California, Check it out.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Mertle Beach, South Carolina would be fun to visit during the summer.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	Just drive and make sure you got maps, cellphones, and extra gas or a gps.

vA1zMzhKaa	If it was drug-related, you stand very little chance - ships now have a zero tolerance toward drugs. If it was alcohol-related, it won't necessarily stop them employing you, but you do need to be upfront about it. After your interview you will have to provide police clearance. If you have lied or just not told them, it looks very bad. Talk to the person interviewing you, they can let you know how strict that particular company is and whether or not you should continue with the employment process.    I hope it works out for you - I'm youth staff and I love it. You'll be paid to travel and play with kids all day!|`|94b8KImYaa	It depends on the cruise line. Not all of them ask for a police record - or clearance of such. I worked 12 years onboard cruise ships and never was I asked for one.   What you will need to have done is a drug test before joining the ship.     My suggestion is to apply. If they ask about criminal records - be upfront and honest.   But don't volunteer information which lays 2 years back.     Good luck|`|iVUh6dRJaa	Check this out:  http://www.mycruiseshipjob.com/members/c...  http://www.workoncruiseships.com/    Good Luck
QdYiF0f6aa	the last time i was there it was at around 9k.  but price MIGHT go down, because they'll be releasing DSi pretty soon. it's coming out April 5 in the US, so it might be  out there around that time, or maybe earlier.  So if you want, you can wait several months and see how prices react to the new release...|`|cGNaZU4Gaa	they dont sell it there, it will be released in the phillipines in 26 years according to the nintendo website after ww3|`|QYC6cjwEaa	Lowest is around 8k.

zBWefnYHaa	I have never been to Pinkpop, but I have been to Limburg at the same weekend a few years back and many people in the train traveled to Pinkpop.<br>  Last year I answered a question like yours and then I found extra travel information on the NS rail planner, but for this year the info is not yet available.<br>  <br>  Most years, or always, you can take a train from Pinkpop to the north, I think it is always to Amsterdam but there might be more destinations. <br>  It is an extra train that runs after the event for the day.<br>  This train will stop at all main stations underway, and as Eindhoven is one of those, you will be sure of a train home after the end of the concerts for the day. There might even be several to chose between.<br>  And as far as I know there are also shuttle buses to get you from the grounds to the station, (and before the event the other way round of course.)<br>  I had a look at this years Pinkpop site, no travel info yet, (but I still give you the link in sources, as there is information about when and where to buy the tickets.)<br>  I found a general pop festival info site and they confirm the shuttle bus between the station and the festival, see the last link in source.<br>  <br>  Listening to the stories from people who have been tells me, it is worth going, and from Eindhoven transport should not be a problem. But it is early days as the tickets are only on sale from 7th of March and the train travel information is not confirmed.

Come to Portugal and enjoy the sunlight|`|SqptcWtQaa	As far as I know no ill feelings. If someone makes something wrong in any country must answer for it.<br>  One thing I must say. Algarve is a ghetto of resident foreigners mostly from England. Algarve is not genuine Portugal anymore. Some places are better than other but don't expect even to try to learn the language because very few do not speak English and a lot speak 3 or 4 languages more.<br>  Nice whether to spent holidays even for all the portuguese above it without such nice whether. Packed with people for 3 month a year.<br>  I would never live in the Algarve even if my family keeps a house there where I go during middle season.<br>  Everybody coming to live in Portugal always think about Algarve because of the weather.

ZFtvfOxCaa	FALAKNUMA PALACE,<br>  As the name suggests it is the kings palace, which is situated 5km away from Charminar in Hyderabad<br>  <br>   golconda..fort.plan a trip to the golconda fort. the ambience around the fort is amazing...<br>  Built by Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1525, the Golconda Fort epitomises the opulent nawabi culture of the time. Famous features of Golconda includes its system of acoustics - a hand clap at a certain point below the dome at the entrance reverbarates and can be heard clearly at the Bala Hissar, the highest point almost a kilometre away...<br>  The impregnable fort was cradled by many dynasties and it was of strategic importance to most of the rulers. In 1518, when the Qutb Shahi dynasty was found, Golconda was made its capital. The subsequent generations saw Golconda being fortified further with several additions and the formation of a beautiful city within. <br>  The fortress city within the walls was famous for the diamond trade and famous Ko-hi-noor diamond, which now lies embeded in the crown of the queen of england is said to have come from here.<br>  A new attraction at the fort is a sound and light show that brings the legend of Golconda to life<br>  <br>  Built with Geometric intricacies during the reign of Ganapathi Deva, the Warangal Fort with its impressive and beautifully carved thorana (leaf like) arches, and pillers inside spread over a radius of 19 kms between Hanumakonda and Warangal and the impregnable fort was popularly known as the seat of power. The fort consists of seven towers, with a radius of 8 kms. The main Fort has 45 towers, and a Temple of Mother earth in the middle of the fort (Swayam Bhudevi Alayam).<br>  <br>  Pakhal Lake Around the tranquel man made Pakhal Lake with perennial streams of water is located about 50Kms east of Warangal, amidst undulating forest-clad hills and dales, Pakhal Lake built during the reign of King Ganapathi Deva as it stands as a live example of the Vastu Vignana (Knowledge of Vastu) which found its expression in the building activity of the Kakatiya Kings. Set around shores of this lake is the Pakhal wild life sanctuary covering an area of 900 sq.km with densforest, shelter of tigers and <br>  a large variety of other animals and birds.<br>  <br>  A Legendary master peice known as Khush Mahal was built by ***tabh Khan (reign 1504-1512).It is situated close to the glorious Warangal fort. Splended idols which were found during excavations are presently, kept in this Gijantic Mahal. This edifice majestically stands as a silent symbol of the past glory of Kakatiya dynasty .<br>  <br>  The legendary of Kakatiya Kingdom, located near the temple of Goddess earth in the Warangal Fort, a big single rock which resembles a hillock is an antique piece, it is also used as watch tower by the soldiers. This is a glamorous tower built in with a design representing as eight angles standing tall on the Rock. It is believed that the great poet Pothana <br>  wrote immortal Bhagawatha sitting on the top of the <br>  rock of a temple located near by the Fort. <br>  <br>  Majestic arches which mark the grandeur of Kakatiya sculptures stand tall on all four sides of the temple complex. These magnificent arches symbolize the very culture of the Telugus.<br>  <br>  The tombs of the sultans who ruled over much of the Deccan region during the 16th and 17th centuries are located a short distance from the Golconda fort.|`|UMIWCzMdaa	open this site|`|sU92tGxfaa	Here is the complete data for you which will help you in your trips around hyderabad.

Or you can ask around, I asked my co workers.  They were all very eager to help.  Or just luck, Walking around you can see Dojo's and just walk in and ask.<br>  <br>  FYI <br>  Most dojo's teach martial arts as an ART and not a form of combat training.<br>  Kung Fu is a Chinese martial art.|`|e0fOOpAYaa	ask nigahiga

Easter isn't until April 12th so I don't know what the guy above me is talking about.  The most popular time starts around the third week of March when kids start being off for spring break.  You should be missing those crowds for the most part.  You're also out of there before St. Patrick's day which brings crowds, and the Flower and Garden Festival doesn't officially start until the 18th of March.<br>  <br>  Expect your temps to be in the mid to upper 70's.|`|jbIvIsTpaa	no u'll be find since easter is later this year!<br>  its actually the best time!<br>  i went the week of easter last year and that was crazzy!<br>  ill never do that agin! lol<br>  it'lll be perfect! <br>  it shouldnt be too busy!<br>  have a great tripp!|`|psmJInNRaa	yes, it is busy.
vXFpzKRaaa	Personally I feel the earlier you buy the tickets the better deal you're likely to get.  Not only will you have one less thing to worry about, you'll have more time to do things you really enjoy without thinking about getting the tickets.  <br>  <br>  I've personally have bought tickets from Kayak and they're great.  I'm sure the others are good as well, I just found the best price for my particular situation on Kayak.  My advice is not to limit yourself to just Kayak, but look around at several different online places.  You'll be amazed at how different the prices can be for the same flight.|`|mldo1vxYaa	I would start looking now, as the seats sell out they increase the price, unless you want to leave it to the last minute and get a good deal. Delta.com is fairly cheap with flights,then you have the usuals like american airlines and us airways etc.|`|GhrJVbFEaa	We like Kayak.  We just booked for FLA but found that tickets were cheapest in November/December - about 3-4 months prior to the flight. Not always the case if you can wait and get last minute deals.

It fled Nakhodka, a harbor near Russia’s borders with North Korea and China, on Feb. 12 after the shipment of rice it unloaded was rejected by the buyer, who then asked a court to seize the ship while suing for damages.<br>  <br>  Russian coastal patrol boat fired on the ship in a bid to stop it from reaching international waters after the court ordered it seized.|`|8d9219ccd2ad58a22a44c4a8dc45cb48aa	didn't know that happened.<br>  <br>  that stinks.|`|AA10310586	As I heard on russian tv, ship was arrested because owners were called to court.

hfigZbx5aa	There are too many emotions in between to nail down one word for it. Closer to the "love" spectrum, you could appreciate, have a fondness, enjoy the company of, etc. Towards the middle, you could have tolerance, acceptance, acquaintanceship, and apathy (plus more, I'm sure). Then closer to hate you can have dislike, distaste, malevolence, distrust, foreboding (if the person gives you the creeps), etc. There's also a secondary grey area off the other way, really, which is total non-emotion typically associated with the psychologically antisocial, who really don't become attached to humans or animals (or anything really) in any significant "love" or "hate" way.|`|d83d9da8709343b3aaed98bd340e3ba5aa	Tolerance and respect.|`|yie2UE0naa	Tolerance or indifference|`|9a98c6a2cb84fbfbec4be6a912bbb028aa	Indifference?|`|huF0dNaGaa	Emotionless.|`|AA11326712	. . . you are being human.

Also, you should have a plan for what places you are going to visit.  You should research the areas where you will be and involve the children in decisions on what places you will visit.  Let them choose some things that they would be interested in seeing.  Also, don't plan to do too much each day.  Traveling can be tiring.  Be sure to carry small snacks and water with you.

AA00000203	It really depends on the Airline, and oftentimes depends on the person you get at the check-in counter.  Some check more carefully than others.  During travel peak-season (Christmas, summer), they are more likely to check.<br>  <br>  If you only need to check in once, and the luggage will be automatically passed through to the second flight, then you likely can just obey the weight limits of the first flight (United at 50 lbs)><br>  <br>  Else, you're better off to stick to 44 lbs, or have an empty bag that can accommodate the excess 6 km to take as carry on, in case at check-in the excess is pointed out.  <br>  <br>  Some airlines charge around USD$50 per excess kilo - so paying extra can get expensive (USD$300 for 6 lbs), and may not be worth it.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Even if you get away with it on the way out, you will probably be charged on the way back.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	are you connecting taking  taking UA to a connecting point then transferring to Kuwait airlines? you might be able to check the baggage<br>  though to your final destination providing that UA have a interline agreement with Kuwait airlines <br>  (which mean you wont have to claim your luggage and recheck<br>  it|`|xIHgTqVhaa	It's possible. Be really nice at check-in. I've been over soooo many times and they usually give me a break (including United). <br>  <br>  If you have the allowance, pack another bag. Otherwise, make sure all your bags weigh about the same. This means you wont be charged for the heaviest bag while still well under with another bag. A couple of times they were nice and told me to transfer some items to even them out. <br>  <br>  Charging you for over sized bags means they have to go through the process. Often, if it's just over, they wont bother. Also, I would take something showing that United has 50lbs and therefore you packed under 50... They might buy it. <br>  <br>  Probably though, your bags will be checked through, you wont see them and they wont bother you about this...but only if you're just and not way over the limit. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Ry8oAQ7Laa	It depends on the UA agent, if he/she sits there to try to research what bag agreements they have with Kuwait, they might, but you just never know. Some agents don't bother to charge if it's another airline you're connecting with.  So if you don't want to risk it, then pack it under 44lbs.  Otherwise be ready to pay in case they charge you.

41ERg1Gvaa	You're mistaken on the history -- Cortlandt St. Station on the R line reopened from 2002 to 2005, when it was closed down for the Fulton St. project and renovations to the station itself. Originally, MTA said that work would be quick and the R/W station would reopen in 2006, but in the spring of 2006 their tune changed, and it's still closed.  So the short answer to your question is that MTA intended for the R station's closure to be shorter than the 1 station's closure, and thus didn't put it on maps for a while (the current map, including the online edition, does show the R station closed).|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, the map you might be looking is an older edition that the MTA forgot to replace. Remember there are thousands of them in the Subway system that they have to replace every time it gets updated.<br>  <br>  BTW: The Corthland Street station on the #, as well as, the "R" and "W" lines are closed until farther notice.

You will be able to live in the UK for two years and be able to work for your entire stay.

zEsfFPGfaa	My goodness...! The picture you are mentioning in your original question IS in the canton of Ticino! It's easy to recognize for a Swiss because of its Italian styled clock tower (Italian architects had a great influence onto the Southern Swiss style of building houses). So you actually simply want to see beautiful scenery. The Ticiono is full of it! Just miss out towns like Lugano, Bellinzona or Locarno - all the small valleyes around these towns are virtually overloaded with beauty. It would make no sense to recommend anything because there would always be someone who had a better idea. Come and see! Enjoy!|`|RZQHB0g8aa	This picture clearly isn't from anywhere in ticino.

i7oHTo9haa	Hi. I agree with Arieh and also see this parallel:<br>  <br>  They are picking the same path of the ancient Philistines, and they do have a choice ahead that can change their outcome, and that is to disarm. If they don't and continue on the same path, any usage of that Palestine/Philistine name trying to take over Israel land by hostility comes with heavy price. Here is what happened the last time someone used that name, the ancient Philistines:<br>  <br>  1 Samuel: 5:10." And they sent away the Ark of G-d to Ekron, and it was that when the Ark of G-d came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, "They have brought around the Ark of the G-d of Israel to me to kill me and my people."<br>  5:11. "And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, "Send away the Ark of the G-d of Israel, and let it return to its place, so that it will not kill me and my people," for there was a panic of death in the entire city; the hand of G-d was very heavy there."<br>  <br>  So basically what happened is the Philistines lost land in war, stole our Ark then realized our G-d was killing them, gave the Ark back. They went home, made a blood sacrifice undoubtedly to some pagan god, and tried to come after Israel again. David then killed Goliath (and the rest of them) then built Jerusalem. G-d made the Philistines extinct because they didn't learn their lesson. So does this sound familiar like deja vu again? Because the Arabs have already admitted there is no such thing as "philistine/palestine" people they pick their own poison, so to speak.<br>  <br>  "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."<br>  <br>  Nobody has ever gone against Israel and won. Every war that Israel has collectively decided to fight, with the hand of G-d, she has won. I wish no harm to them but just wish they would disarm. Usage of this word with Gaza already has biblical parallels. Even the bedouin call Gaza cursed. But funny, when Israel is in control of it then it blooms! Coincidence? I think not! They are a different people but they're picking the same fate.<br>  <br>  According to Judaism the Ark is hidden til the time that we are redeemed by G-d (we are many redeemed and some still in process) and according to Quran the Muslims believe in the Ark.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Anything mentioning Amalek or their descendants is relevant today.|`|iCMrsV9daa	"thou shall not steal"<br>  "thou shall not murder"
NK3VJgiRaa	Oh there is plenty of educational stuff you can do. In Old San Juan there are tons of historical sites with tours & museums. The most famous site is El Morro Fort, which was built by the spaniards hundreds of years ago to protect the island. La Fortaleza is the govenor's palacae. It was built in the 1500's & is also an important landmark. Most of the sites in Old San Juan have tours or allow visitors. But there are also walking tours that you can do which are only a few hours long. <br>  <br>  Outside of San Juan there are also lots of things to see, but I am not sure if you can do them because you would need to pay for tours to take you there & they are kind of expensive. Or unless you could have a van rented or something.  El Yunque rain forest is a good place to go.

I forwarded these to the FBI. A few years back in Jewish chat, there were two BHI members that would come into the Jewish chat room and declare they were preparing for the war to kill all the "fake white Jews".<br>  <br>  They are the black counterpart to the Christian Identity and White Supremacist replacement ideology.<br>  PLEASE read the reports below from the Anti-Defamation League and the other links from the FBI and SPLC.<br>  This group is NO different than the KKK in terms of its rabid Jew hating ideology being spread.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I am sure that like other groups who wish to replace Jews, they're very sincere in their ideation.  As to the person below that tries to make it appear Jews are racist to blacks, NO, that is NOT the case at ALL. <br>  <br>  There ARE and have been real black Jews since the days of Moses, and the first link I gave is a page about REAL black Jews.  Jewish identity has never been defined by or limited by race.  It is against Jewish law to discriminate.<br>  <br>  Quotes from the FBI report below indicate the group in Israel is not known for the violence the U.S.groups are promoting.  However, it is clear they do not follow Judaism, believe in a doctrine closer to Christianity as it is a New Testament doctrine, yet some believe their own leader is the messiah reincarnated..<br>  <br>  Here now, the quotes:<br>  "The extreme elements of the BHI movement are prone to engage in violent activity. As seen in previous convictions of BHI followers, adherents of this philosophy have a proven history of violence, and several indications point toward a continuation of this trend. Some BHI followers have been observed in public donning primarily black clothing, with emblems and/or patches bearing the “Star of David” symbol. Some BHI members practice paramilitary operations and wear web belts and shoulder holsters. Some adherents have extensive criminal records for a variety of violations, including weapons charges, assault, drug trafficking, and fraud.<br>  <br>  In law enforcement circles, BHI groups are typically associated with violence and criminal activity, largely as a result of the movement’s popularization by Yahweh Ben Yahweh, formerly known as Hulon Mitchell, Jr., and the Miami-based Nation of Yahweh (NOY). In reality, the origins of the BHI movement are non-violent. While the BHI belief system may have roots in the United States as far back as the Civil War era, the movement became more recognized as a result of the teachings of an individual known as Ben Ami Ben Israel, a.k.a Ben Carter, from the south side of Chicago. Ben Israel claims to have had a vision at the age of 27, hearing “a voice tell me that the time had come for Africans in America, the descendants of the Biblical Israelites, to return to the land of our forefathers.” [29] Ben Israel persuaded a group of African-Americans to accompany him to Israel in 1967, teaching that African-Americans descended from the biblical tribe of Judah and, therefore, that Israel is the land of their birthright. Ben Israel and his followers initially settled in Liberia for the purposes of cleansing themselves of bad habits. In 1969, a small group of BHI followers left Liberia for Israel, with Ben Israel and the remaining original migrants arriving in Israel the following year. Public source estimates of the BHI community in Israel number between 1500 and 3000. [30] Despite promoting non-violence, members of Ben Israel's movement have shown a willingness to engage in criminal activity. For example, in 1986, Ben Israel and his top aide, Prince Asiel Ben Israel, were convicted of trafficking stolen passports and securities and forging checks and savings bonds. [31] <br>  <br>  BHI in Israel are generally peaceful, if somewhat controversial. The FBI has no information to indicate that Ben Israel’s BHI community in Israel is planning any activity - terrorist, criminal, or otherwise - inspired by the coming millennium. Ben Israel’s claims to legitimate Judaism have at times caused consternation to the Israeli government. BHI adherents in Israel have apparently espoused anti-Semitic remarks, labeling Israeli Jews as “imposters.” [32] Neither the Israeli government nor the Orthodox rabbinate recognize the legitimacy of BHI claims to Judaism. According to Jewish law, an individual can be recognized as Jewish if he/she was born to a Jewish mother or if the individual agrees to convert to Judaism. [33] At present, BHI in Israel have legal status as temporary residents, which gives them the right to work and live in Israel, but not to vote. They are not considered to be Israeli citizens. While BHI claims to Judaism are disregarded by Israeli officials and religious leaders, the BHI community is tolerated and appears to be peaceful. [34] <br>  <br>  While the BHI community in Israel is peaceful, BHI adherents in the United States became associated with violence thanks to the rise of the NOY, which reached the height of its popularity in the 1980s. The NOY was founded in 1979 and led by Yahweh Ben Yahweh. Ben Yahweh’s followers viewed him as the Messiah, and therefore demonstrated unrequited and unquestioned obedience. Members of the organization engaged in numerous acts of violence in the 1980s, including several homicides, following direct orders from Ben Yahweh. Seventeen NOY members were indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami in 1990-91 on charges of RICO, RICO conspiracy, and various racketeering acts. Various members were convicted on RICO conspiracy charges and remain imprisoned."

sOi98doYaa	Churchill wrote several letters to Devalera (They were fairly good pen pals amazingly??). He offered Devalera an end to partition,and to reunite the Island again, using the famous quote 'To be a nation once again'<br>  <br>   Devalera rejected this offer, as he felt he would have to give up neutrality and join the war.<br>  <br>    What is generally accepted, is that Devalera didn't want the headache of dealing with the unionists, in a bitterly divided northern Ireland.|`|YNfJzd0paa	Apparantly, there never was any serious offer made by Churchill.|`|373267de54a567ce4fdd303d84705891aa	he was offered it, at first as a bargaining chip by Churchill to try and get Ireland involved in world war 2. DeValera didnt want this, as Ireland had already been involved in a war of independence and then the civil war, not to mention the famine less than a 100yrs previous which had decimated the population. The country couldnt have taken another war.. <br>  <br>  Churchill made more offers, but he never actually stated how they would go about it, as the majority of unionists in N. Ireland wold never have agreed to it anyway...so was he just going to force N. Ireland to be part of the Rep?  So his offers were never taken seriously, and had they been serious the catch of joining world war 2 was still there.|`|QY5YOZcmaa	Churchill offered an end to partition if we supported Britain in WW2. DeValera turned this down as a, we couldn't handle aother war, b, Ireland had just got the 3 treaty military ports of berehaven, cobh and lough swilly off the british. This allowed us to stay neutral as we had no british military stationed here. The fact that we stayed neutral was kind of us stating "We are not part of the united Kingdom", thus making Ireland a bit more independant than it already was ( but we didnt gain full independance until 1949)

You want to go alone to Manhattan to "party," yet you are (justifiably) worried about your safety.  Why, exactly, are you doing this, then?  <br>  I don't know what clubbing is like.  When I was young and working--and, briefly,  living--in Manhattan, I wasn't into that scene.  There have been several incidents recently where young women were killed because they were out all night at some bar, went home with someone and were never seen again.  And what everyone asks is, "What the hell was this girl thinking?"  These women go out, get drunk, hook up with some lunatic--when something horrible happens, of course you feel bad, but it's hard to be surprised.   <br>  I'd say stay out of small, hole-in-the-wall places.  Dance and have fun, yes, but always be aware of your surroundings.  Don't leave your purse; always make sure it's obvious that you have a grip on it and are paying attention.  Don't leave a drink unattended, and don't drink too much!  Stop worrying about mixing different kinds--don't do that, period.  Pick one type of drink, have two or three, and that's it.    Do not, no matter how much you may like a guy, leave with anyone.  Make a date for lunch the next day or whatever, but don't leave with anyone.  Don't linger outside; get a cab right back to your hotel.|`|MFcbRot8aa	Eat the cost of the hotel room and party at home with some friends.<br>  You're nuts to go clubbing alone, doesn't matter if you're male or female.<br>  Fergedabutit

This is normally dealt on a case by case basis.<br>  <br>  Alternative ideas, check out earlier at noon but leave your bags at the hotel concierge.  For the next 9 hours, you can either roam the city or sit in the lobby.  If you want a place to shower or a nap before going to Changi airport, perhaps consider taking a room at hourly rate hotels such as Hotel 81 or Fragrance Hotel (cost about S$30?) or got to the Plaza Premium Lounge at Changi airport (S$30 also?)|`|PDotv2Hsaa	When you make your reservation, you can ask the hotel if they are willing to waive the late checkout charges for you.

QvSwo3X9aa	The Memphis airport is close to Graceland and all the cabs know how to get there. There is an extra fee to tour Elvis's planes and cars but it you're going with a big group they might have a discount. You arrive at the starting office across the street from Graceland and they take you on a bus through the gates one group at a time. They give you headphones to hear the tour but you don't have to use them if you don't want to. You start at the front door and work your way to from the living room area to the back yard and you end at the gravesite. Its a great look into the Kings life and I know you'll love it. There are lots of gift shops outside but buy your souvenirs before you go so you don't have to lug the bags around.

It eventually burned down though (allegedly by pirates), and was never rebuilt (but the Magellan's Cross was rescued from the fire). <br>  <br>  The said church is considered as the first Catholic church in the Philippines and was made of lightweight materials such as bamboo and coconut lumber.<br>  <br>  The first official Catholics in the Philippines were Raha Humabon and his wife, christened as Juana. But history texts show that when Magellan was defeated by Lapu-Lapu (an enemy Raha), Humabon immediately defected to Animism. Legaspi finds one of the statues that Magellan gave to Queen Juana in a house of the chief babaylan in Cebu, together with other gods and goddesses of the ancient Filipinos.

No smoking compartments in the trains were routinely ignored. However, Italy was one of the first countries here to ban smoking in some public places and people actually follow the law. People go outside to smoke after a meal or hop off the train at stops - it doesn't really seem to have cut down on smoking, but it's possible to avoid the smoke in confined spaces now.|`|ekOxP2ZKaa	I do not think it is a matter of "educated properly".<br>  In the States for instance it is possible to buy a gun just as in Europe we go and buy bread.<br>  I wonder what it is worse....|`|hT8vbWiDaa	No so much any more.

pm2EeEgiaa	It depends on what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  SINGAPORE is for Shopping: It is the ideal place for first-time travelers to Asia because there is less culture shock, English is widely spoken, and it has First World amenities. It is also the gateway to Asia and you can grab connecting flights from here to any Asian country. Singapore is well known for its shopping and nightlife (although some of its' laws are very strict).<br>  <br>  INDONESIA is for Islamic Culture: It is the world's largest Islamic country. It lies in the equator, and if you love beaches, resorts, and exploring (backpack/surfing/jungle walks), then Indonesia is for you. Bali, Lombok, and Batam are all well-known for beaches, but some tourists also choose to visit Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Kalimantan for their highland tribal adventure. Papua and Maluku are altogether different from the rest of Indonesia - most of them are of the Papuan race. You can get by with English in major resorts and cities but in the hinterlands, better buy an Indonesian phrasebook.<br>  <br>  MALAYSIA is for Multiculturalism: Chinese, Indian, and Malay cultures mix here - and it also boasts of some of the world's greatest architectural feats such as the Petronas Towers. Malaysia has some beaches and highlands resort in the Western part of the country, but it's Sabah and Sarawak in the Eastern part which have the most adventures. English is spoken in the country, but the fluency greatly dwindles as you go out of the city.<br>  <br>  Or, try STAR CRUISES. It is a cruise boat that encircles Asia: it covers Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, and is a very good and cheaper alternative to discovering the region for the first time. The staff speak perfect English (because most of them are Filipinos) and the service is A-OK - you'll also meet a lot of Asian wealthy teens and yuppies here.|`|tJheM3Teaa	all 3 are beautiful countries with such wonderful and welcoming people, its worth trying to visit each country if you can. Maybe a cruise around the orient? They usually go japan, china, korea, thailand, vietnam and the 3 places you want to go. It may cost a bit more then you were hoping to spend but it will deff be worth it!|`|gym3Do4Haa	Check out Malaysia at the source below. It has all that Singapore has at a much lower price.

onySROuhaa	Be careful changing dollars with the people walking around on the street.  That is their job, they are trying to make money!  I used ATMs the whole time I was there (few years) because my bank allowed free international withdrawls.  Or else just to one of the little shops called cambios (means change).  They have fair rates usually.  Oh and just a warning... banca does not mean bank!  Those are gambling establishments... so don't give them your money!  I know a lot of people that got confused by that.  Banco is a bank.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Bring dollars since you will get a better exchange rate down there. You can also take cash out of any ATM for about a $3 charge.  The only thing is don't change at your hotel.  Most tourist areas have money changers walking around on corners and they will give you a good rate and exchange shops are everywhere.  If you go to a bank it takes longer to exchange cash and you need to fill out paperwork.<br>  <br>  It's been very stable over the last few years with highs around 32 and lows around 35 to a dollar.|`|Dhsyroekaa	I would do it here before you go.

xSHRJw46aa	That is a very difficult question.  Only one park...Ouch.<br>  <br>  Normally I would say you should do the Magic Kingdom because it is the quintessential Disney park.  However, I started to picture myself at Disney by myself and started to think  that one of the other three would be better.  By myself I think I would go to either Epcot or Hollywood Studios. At epcot there are a few really good rides.  Mission Space (somewhat scary) and Test Track(not scary at all) are very good.  Soarin (not at all scary) is excellent.  There are also some other decent things to see in the front of the park.  The back of the park is the 'countries'.  These are pavilions setup for different countries.  Each has something to see.  So, you can walk around the countries and see their shows and ride the boats in Mexico and Norway.  There is usually sidewalk entertainment along the way.  Also, if they are doing the fireworks and laser show at the end of the day, it is definitely worth staying to see.<br>  <br>  Have fun.  Wish I would be there.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	Epcot is great because there are 2 different side, there is the world showcase & there is the world of tommorow. If you are only going for the day, this is the most bang for your buck. You will be completely exhausted, there is so much to do.<br>  Magical Kingdom is great if you have kids, they really cater to that.<br>  Animal Kingdom is nice, we got bored there pretty quickly.  The shows are amazing & the safari ride is not all its cracked up to be. <br>  Disneys Hollywood Stuido's would be my 2nd favorite.  This place is so awesome, they have the tower of terror.  They have stunt shows, the back lots tours, there are shows going on on the streets constantly.  The Muppet 3-D show...love it! They also have the Aerosmith ride...that was super cool.<br>  Read the reviews of what people have to say & then go to this website & check out whats best for you:<a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/" rel="nofollow">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/</a><br>  <br>  HAVE A BLAST - don't forget comfy shoes & your camera!|`|AM33tqYAaa	magic kingdom or epcot<br>  i have never been, but i have heard good things about those 2|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	If you don't like scary rides, I'd stay out of the MGM Studios.  The Magic Kingdom is great, and if you've never been and can only visit one park, well, that's what I think of as the "real" Disney. <br>  A second choice would be Epcot.  That's really two parks: Future World and the World Showcase.  It's a somewhat different experience from the Magic Kingdom, perhaps more geared to adults, but really great. <br>  I'd say, one day, first time:  Magic Kingdom, hands down.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	magic kingdom. <br>  its great for all ages. <br>  it has the classic rides like haunted mansion, pirates of the caribbean, jungle cruise, its a small world, peter pan's flight, winnie the pooh, snow white, thunder mountain, space mountain, splash mountain. <br>  plus you can meet and greet with all the characters and cinderella's castle is its icon and its beautiful. <br>  <br>  i'm 22 yrs old and its still my favorite park out of the 4 disney world parks.|`|tnznR01paa	If you're not into scary rides I'd go to Magic Kingdom or Hollywood Studios, I've never been to Animal Kingdom and I don't like Epcot that much. If you like a little thriller I'd go to Hollywood Studios, it's more for older people. Magic Kingdom has a lot of little kids rides, but still great for older people too. If I were you I'd look at some of the rides and see which one's you'd be more willing to go on.<br>  <br>  Have a great time:).|`|WUnEENDQaa	if this is your 1st trip, and you only want 1 park....magic kingdom would be the place to go.  words can't really describe why.|`|9NSfJChaaa	If you aren't into scary rides stick with either the Magic Kingdom or Epcot.  <br>  <br>  MAGIC KINGDOM<br>  This is the original Disney World theme park. It is geared towards families, so there are lots of easy going fun rides.  There are a few "thrill" rides, but nothing really scary.  This is also the park that has the most to do with the characters.  Magic Kingdom tends to have the longest hours, as well.<br>  <br>  EPCOT<br>  This would be my second choice for you.  There are a few rides that you might not care for like Mission: SPACE if you aren't into the idea of a ride having barf bags on it.  The good and bad part of EPCOT is that the rides are at the front of the park and the whole back of the park are countries represented from around the world.  If you're looking for a more leisurely, educational day then go to EPCOT and do the  few rides, the whole World Showcase, and the rides again on the way out.|`|jbIvIsTpaa	EPCOT!! <br>  best park there! you has neato rides and the world area is filled w/ awesome stuff and great food!<br>  the onther parks are mostly based for younger kids but this park has soarin (which i suggest you get there early for) and a whole bunch more. go on their website and look up the different parks!<br>  have a great tripp!|`|AM0SieZLaa	Go to Epcot, its really entertaining and has got quite alot of not that scary rides inside! :]<br>  On the other hand, Hollywood studios and Animal Kingdom are good too!<br>  I'd suggest you went to the website (www.disney.com) and find out which would suit you best!<br>  Have fun when you go.|`|Aw6nZ4wWaa	epcot,animal kingdom,magic kingdom!|`|tRJrYZEHaa	Epcot.

You have a couple options. If you are a resident of the UK, that country is on the VWP (Visa Waiver Program) which allows you to come to the US for a period not to exceed 90 Days without a Visa. However, you do need a valid passport regardless under any non-immigrant class visa.<br>  <br>  The easiest Visa to apply and get is the B-2 Visa which will keep you in the US for at minimum 6 months but not to exceed 1 year. There are extensions available in increments of 6 months however, you must apply for those while in the United States in status (not overstayed). Keep in mind, this visa does not authorize you to work. You will have to prove that you will not become a public charge while here and must show some sort of plans to leave at the end of your visa.<br>  <br>  They ask various questions in relation to your life and purpose in the America. The purpose of the interview is to determine if you are of good moral character, will not become a public charge to tax payer dollars, purpose of being in the US and that you will not violate the laws and the status of your visa and to determine if you are or will be inadmissible to the US. <br>  <br>  Complications? That is going to vary for person to person. How can you prove if you will not become a public charge (since you cannot work)? Bank Account statements, relatives in the US, etc. Have you committed any crimes in your country? Have you attempted to enter the US illegally (EWI)? Are inadmissible under INA 212, Inadmissibility? That is what is determined and that is what can cause complications. You personally, would know better if you would cause any complications.<br>  <br>  You will need to await your passport and apply for the visa at your the US Counsular Office in your home country. Once you receive your visa, it cannot be expired prior to application for admission into the US. They will determine at that time you present yourself for admission if you inadmissible or admissible.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

0ZfZulnzaa	Home is where the heart is.  Family ties are very strong. Which is why I am back in Sask after living all over Canada, I have lived in BC on 2 different occasions. BC was a beautiful place to live, a lot of things to do and see, but for us Home is Saskatchewan.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of nice places to live in the interior of BC, Kelowna, Pentiction, Kamloops etc. I would stay away from around Vancouver, too many people, very busy etc. <br>  <br>  I am not sure where you are considering in Sask, but there are a lot of nice rural communities that are close to the bigger centres.  I have lived in Moose Jaw(awesome place to raise a family and a nice little city) Saskatoon, and Prince Albert where I am now(and I do not recommend moving here!)  Moose Jaw has SIAST, Saskatoon and Regina both have universities, as well both have SIAST campuses. <br>  <br>  Ultimately it will be a decision you and your husband will have to consider together, pros and cons of each province would be my starting point and then finding the cities you want to live in. <br>  <br>  Saskatchewan does have a lower cost of living, lower housing costs, lower insurance, no monthly medical payment. Jobs are still being found around Sask, pretty much anything and everything. <br>  <br>  But like I said at the beginning Home is where the Heart is! I would choose Saskatchewan for the simple fact being around family is one of the most important things in life, your kids will benefit so much from being close to family as well.|`|uiX853hPaa	Saskatchewan for sure. Big cities like Vancouver are more dangerous than places like Regina or Saskatoon (no matter what Maclean's magazine tells you). Plus Sask has a lower cost of living, and the economy here is still strong.|`|wJhZnNV7aa	I would say depends on what you want to do for work. In either province some jobs may be harder to find. BC is more expensive to live cost of living is higher. But BC is beautiful more hills :) I enjoy visiting both places. You could get more for your money in saskatchewan for houses. If you have family in saskatchewan then i would pick saskatchewan and visit bc. But if you want a little space between you and the family go to bc. I recommend staying in alberta :) just don't live in calgary. Calgary is a crazy city to live. You could live closer to the mountains in a smaller community and get what your looking for as well. Go luck in your search for happiness.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I have close friends that lived in Cloverdale BC, and it was more expensive to live and there were times when their young son actually witnessed a drug deal.  After my pal finished his Accounting courses, he packed up and moved out to Saskatchewan to raise his family. He has family out there and housing is a lot cheaper.  <br>  <br>  I can't say which is better because I only live in BC but I hope that helps.|`|dq2i6NrAaa	BC <br>  <br>  Defiantly BC!

UIJorsD7aa	No.<br>  If your passport says you were born in Israel, no Arab/Muslim country would allow you to visit.|`|bmhnXEsVaa	Although I was not born in Israel, I am, nonetheless of Jewish descent. This information may give you a better understanding although it doesn't really answer your question...<br>  I toured with a group of Gentiles 2 years ago from the US to Israel & then to Jordan, to see Petra. Although the Jordanian Boarder Patrol allowed all the Gentiles to pass through customs & back into Israel with not so much as a hitch, they held me on the Jordanian side for 45 minutes while they informed me of where I grew up, where both my parents were born, where they went to school & other personal information.<br>  I was scared to death. Why, being the only Jew in the bunch, were they detaining me? Why did they have all that personal info on me & my family? I wanted to cry & pee my pants but I remained outwardly calm.<br>  Once they allowed me to pass over, I walked up to the 3 Israeli flags & kissed one as I broke down & wept in relief. I was physically shaking from nerves. An Israeli soldier in his thick accent but in English said, "Jordan sucks; no?"<br>  I busted up laughing at that, which was exactly what I needed to calm my nerves. <br>  There is strong hostility between Arab/Muslim countries & Israel. simply being Jewish is considered offensive enough in the mind of an Arab to cause problems.<br>  EDIT...Obviously, my passport did have "Israel" stamped inside it.|`|B3FBgxjEaa	YEMEN<br>  Despite the tensions on the Arab-Israeli front, there have been persistent rumors and reports of discreet meetings between Yemeni and Israeli officials, of discreet visits to Yemen by Israeli Jews of Yemeni origin, of liaison activities between the US and Yemen with Israel being the main subject, etc. Most observers believe that such contacts and linkages existed during the 1990s and continue to exist.

48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	It depends on what you consider "warm".<br>  <br>  Washington is below the Mason-Dixon Line, so it is considered "The South".  It also lies pretty much at sea level, so the usual mountainous conditions that lead to increased colder weather are not a concern.<br>  <br>  Having said all of the above, it usually starts to get into the 50 F range in March.  Then 60 F in April.  Then 70 to 80 F in May.  BUT, anything is possible.  In 2008, it snowed for Easter, which was in LATE APRIL of that year.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	By mid march most days are starting to get milder, like in the 50s or lows 60s. <br>  <br>  But it wont get consistently warm probably until about Mid april.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Honestly not until late March, early May.|`|1f88iwfMaa	In March, the average daily highs stay in the mid-50s, but it still gets cold (mid-30s) at night.

Maryland and DC winters can be inconsistent however, during the winter months isn't not all that uncommon here to have day time temperatures in the 20s, then in the next few days have temperatures in the 50s. Much the same can be said going into early spring, we've actually had snowfall in early April before (it's not common for this area, and it was only flurries, but it has happened before). <br>  <br>  At any rate I'd say until about the second week of April, be prepared for inconsistency in the weather patterns, that's basically what the winter season is like around here. Since you are conditioned though to a really warm climate though, it might take you longer to feel warmth as compared to the locals around you. Even in April people around here will still be wearing pants.|`|tBoJLQ6Zaa	April usually. I think March is always cold.

It has the Louisville slugger factory (your husband might like it, I didn't even mind it) you can take a tour of. Also, Churchill Downs. They give tours and there is a museum. Nice little downtown area along the river. Eat at Lynn's Paradise Cafe. (My husband still talks about the hot brown he ate there).<br>  <br>  - Lexington, KY. Visit just north in Georgetown to get some authentic chocolate bourbon balls. Take a free tour of the Toyota plant (really interesting). Then go to Lexington and see the Kentucky Horse Park.<br>  <br>  - Cleveland, OH: Check out the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Visit the West Side Market.<br>  <br>  - Indianapolis, IN: Wonderful, free art museum. Has a lot of very known artist's work there and amazing since it is free. There is a state park there (Fort Harrison) used to have prison of war camp. Nice nature center and trails.
kgBPU4xxaa	With 10 days, you would have plenty of time to cover Tuscany and spend a day or two in Rome; whether you should or not is a matter of your priority and interests. <br>  <br>  Certainly there are lots of interesting things to see and do in both places. I live about two hours north of Florence and spend a lot of time exploring Tuscany, but Rome is also a great place to visit. It's only an hour 40 minutes from Rome to Florence on the high speed trains. It would be pretty easy to do a day trip to Rome from there. I've done it several times from my home when visitors have been interested in going to Rome. <br>  <br>  When will you be here? There are a lot of interesting local festivals that are worth visiting throughout the year. This is a good site for finding interesting events around the world: <a href="http://www.whatsonwhen.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=home" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatsonwhen.com/sisp/index.ht...</a> . <br>  <br>  There are tons of guide books that cover the Tuscany in general and Florence in  particular in great detail. While you're in Florence, go see the Orsanmichele. The San Miniato al Monte church is worth visiting if you go up to Piazza Michelangelo (and the views of Florence are worth the walk). There are lots of great, small hill towns to visit. Siena and Arezzo are bigger, but also definitely worth seeing. If you go to Pisa, go see the tower in the morning and then head to Lucca for the rest of the day. There's more to see and do in the old walled city there.|`|AA11564934	you're gooing to land in Rome, so maybe do at least 2-3 days there, then do the rest in Tuscany.<br>  <br>  If you really want more of the flavor of an area and relax, stay in Tuscany.  If you want to see all the big things in Italy, move around, it totally dpeends on your priority|`|8oXQXSmraa	Well Tuscany is really wonderful... But you can't definitely miss Venice and Rome... It depends on what you are expecting from your holiday, in Tuscany you'll have a great time, the landscape, the towns (don't miss Firenze, Pisa and Siena), the beaches, the people, the food. But Rome and Venice are also amazing... You don't want to miss those two cities!! If you plan to come back to Italy, then maybe stay in Tuscany and enjoy your dream... But if you're not sure about coming back, then don't miss Rome and Venice, this is my advice :) By the way, I'm Italian, so if you need more information do not hesitate to contact me!|`|MVVQrEasaa	We spent two weeks in Italy last year with our 7 year old, and did the entire time in Tuscany.  There is so much to see and do, and we wanted a slower paced vacation with less running around to get to the "next spot".<br>  <br>  So we missed Rome and Venice.  We saw very little of the "big" things everyone goes to see in Florence.  But we climbed lots of towers, spent some time at the beach and we all had a fantastic time.<br>  <br>  I'm presuming that my trip wasn't the only one that I'll take to Italy.  Next time we'll plan to focus more on another area of the country.<br>  <br>  You don't have to fly through Rome to get to Tuscany either.  We came in and left from Pisa - which is a smaller airport and worked really well for us.  Just about anywhere in Pisa is only about a 10 minute taxi ride to the airport, so you can make Pisa your last stop of the trip and enjoy the field of miracles a little more than the day trippers usually do.<br>  <br>  As for where to go - Florence is a "must".  We really enjoyed Lucca, and the hill towns of Volterra and San Gimignano.  But getting to the hill towns is harder without a car so be prepared to rent a car, spend lots of time on public transport (train and bus) to get there or bypass the hill towns altogether.<br>  <br>  Have a great trip!|`|xcV1oVJLaa	I would go and see Rome....but Tuscany is enough...and you'll be close to a couple of other cites you could see on day trips since theyre with in a couple of hours drive or train....<br>  <br>  Sienna, Pisa, Firenze[Florence].....Your going to have a blast.,.I lived there for 5 years,,,,they were the best years of my life......

Anatomy<br>  It is because female have nicer chest than man and more good-looking.<br>  <br>  for Happy Penguin: <br>  my chest aren't hairy, but I always close it because it is flatten and not so exotic. Even though sometimes I expose non-hairy my chest, nobody want to see it...<br>  <br>  2. Physiology<br>  Female Thoracic area have a crucial organ for life = breast. <br>  It is easier for baby to suck their mothers milk, if the mother have exposed designed clothes. <br>  <br>  Male doesn't feed baby.<br>  <br>  3. Economy<br>  As we all know, economic resources are now expensive (including the fabrics). <br>  Since female breast aren't flatted like man, it cost more fabrics to be used to cover thoracic region. <br>  With additional facts that female chest aren't as ugly as male, it is more economic to just show off the region.<br>  <br>  There is one principle in economy, benefits > disadvantanges. <br>  For male, it is more disadvantages (ugly chest) rather than benefit (economy) if they exposed their chest. <br>  For female, there is more advantanges (ok chest) than disadvantages (cost) if they exposed it.<br>  <br>  <br>  =*|`|XBH61aAIaa	Because boobs are beautiful and men's chests are hairy.|`|XzAD49iraa	GOOOOOOD question. :)|`|NiRFYhVDaa	to differentiate men from women|`|7tuSwjliaa	It's not to show off... it's to breathe better.|`|5e6836dfa778c1efeee10f87746767f4aa	women has chest mah man has no chest mah i mean the the bigger one lah|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	just because Boobs are awesome.|`|EMeAw7Bcaa	women's chest should be show off as it attract man|`|pIxrdAVKaa	men like boobs, most designers are men...got it??<br>  <br>  edit: <br>  kencana, does it cost too much to cover female's boobs? how much fabric is needed to cover women's boobs, 1 metre?? really, it's not that expensive unless the boobs are huuuge..|`|CcxqcyH4aa	girls have the chest line and guys think its sexy and really would you like to see a hairy chest .|`|HVY2rqzfaa	Because women have nicer chests? <br>  <br>  I mean, who wants to see some guys hairy ugly chest... <br>  <br>  Ewww...|`|5sp0jxgGaa	men dun have things on their chest to show off hheheh

Also try to keep your clothing in the same colour scheme in case you have to layer up for warmth. What's more, by mixing and matching you'll fool everyone into thinking you have more clothes than you really do.<br>  Shoes: for women, a pair of sandals and comfy espadrilles or wedges will cover all dressing needs from casual to evening. For men, a good pair of leather rubber-soled shoes can easily make the transition from day to night. I'd also recommend bringing a good pair of solid walking shoes as well as a pair of flip-flops/thongs for wearing in showers in case you end up staying in a scummy dive.<br>  Underwear: when it comes to underwear my rule of thumb is to take enough for one week, or for the length of the trip plus two days, whichever is shortest. Again, ensure your underwear is made from natural fabrics — there's nothing worse than getting prickly heat on holiday!<br>  Towel: unless you're staying in hotels and resorts for the duration of your trip, it pays to pack a towel. Whatever you do, don't get sucked into buying one of those chamois towels or one that resembles a hand towel. I can tell you from experience that it won't dry your hair, it won't cover your modesty, and, if you're in a cold climate, you'll freeze before you dry yourself!<br>  Packing: I can't explain it, but somehow bags seem to hold more if you roll your clothes rather than fold them. It also helps minimise creases. Try it, I guarantee it works!<br>  backpacking:If you're travelling with all your earthly possessions on your back then the key is to keep everything to a minimum. Bear in mind that you can easily, and cheaply, replace worn-out items along the way at local markets. Also, while jeans may be a wardrobe staple at home when you're backpacking you'll quickly discover they're hot to wear, heavy to carry and slow to dry. So you might want to reconsider taking the old faithfuls.<br>  When it comes to packing your backpack, place the lighter items at the bottom and the heavier ones on top. Your backpack will feel lighter this way as the pack rests on your lower back. It's also wise to place the things you use the most on top. Dirty clothes are perfect to pack at the bottom of a backpack.<br>  essentials:    * Two pairs of trousers/skirts<br>      * One pair of shorts<br>      * Three t-shirts (mix of short sleeve and singlet)<br>      * One long-sleeve shirt<br>      * A dress (one that can make the transition from day to night)<br>      * A sweater or fleece<br>      * Waterproof wind-breaker<br>      * Pajamas/sleepwear<br>      * Walking shoes/boots<br>      * Sandals or other light shoes<br>      * Thongs/flip flops<br>      * Swimmers<br>      * Bras (sports and regular)<br>      * Underwear<br>      * Bandana/scarf<br>      * Socks<br>      * Sarong<br>      * Towel<br>      * Hat<br>      * Sunscreen<br>  <br>  CLOTHES:<br>  Socks.<br>  Pants.<br>  tops.<br>  Jackets.<br>  Dresses.<br>  Underwear.<br>  Bras.<br>  Singlets.<br>  Skirts.<br>  Pyjamas.<br>  Shoes.<br>  Bathers.<br>  Towel.<br>  <br>  MISC.<br>  <br>  Makeup.<br>  ipod.<br>  ipod Dock.<br>  Pillows.<br>  Cushions.<br>  Doona Cover.<br>  DVD's.<br>  CD's.<br>  Beach Toys.

(and toothpaste goes well with that)<br>  face wash?<br>  makeup remover?<br>  maybe board games??<br>  do you need to take any groceries??<br>      *   Again it may seem obvious but getting your currency converted before you travel will save you a lot of time and trouble. Even if it’s just enough to get you to your hotel and buy you something to eat, it’ll save you looking around for a bank in the middle of the night.<br>      * It doesn’t matter how many times you’re asked “Have you got your passport?” by family or friends there’s still the possibility that you’ll forget!<br>      * Thankfully e-tickets exist these days, so you may not have to remember to pack your plane ticket, but you will need your printed confirmation!<br>  #  If you’re going on holiday then one of the most important things you’ll bring back will be memories, and if you haven’t taken enough photographs you’ll always regret it. Bring a digital camera with as many memory cards as possible, and take pictures of everything: the lovely people you meet, the places you visit, and even the disgusting, poorly maintained ￡1 youth hostel you stayed in. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so don’t be stingy with the film if you’ve got a traditional camera!<br>  # Make sure you don’t forget your toilet|`|YedHndI6aa	hmm i never been to italy b4  but i have been to france and other euro countries...<br>  <br>  u should pack some warm clothes and also clothes u where during a summer... this will make sure that u will be ready for any type of weather..<br>  and  since it a school trip..

It changes quickly, from warm to cold and from cold to warm. So I suggest you to do what we do here: wear more layers, like a t-shirt and jumper, so if it's warm you could pull off the jumper or the sweater.|`|cTuaFrYiaa	In April it is typically in the mid 60s during the day and into the mid 40s at night. It could be warmer are even cooler. I suggest you check the weather forecast A day or two before you pack for your trip.<br>  <br>  Here is a link for the weather in Italy.<br>  <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/global/IY.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wunderground.com/global/IY.ht...</a>
62RKtkOhaa	Well it may be because the Irish have talked up their own country very well AND when Ireland is shown on movies it's all beautiful.<br>  <br>  Besides this maybe the Tourist Board is doing a good job with our euro!!<br>  <br>  You should be pleased that so many people want to come here, it IS beautiful!!|`|yRYsi5zpaa	Ancestry... so many Americans are Irish descendants, so Ireland is very famous over there.<br>  <br>  Checking out the history the countries with the highest emigration rates were 1) Ireland 2)Italy 3)Greece 4) Other Europeans before the wwii due to the rise of fascism and a few East Europeans who wanted to escape from the communist tyranny. <br>  <br>  Check out American surnames, the half of them have Irish roots, some Italian, Greek or Slavic. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, a travel to Europe is always something very exciting for an American, Canadian and Australian.<br>  <br>  Yes Ireland is not better than any other country, but it really depends what do you want to do. For a not very well traveled person and for someone who doesn't know a lot about Europe is ok. My favorite cities that I always reccomend someone to visit in Europe are Florence (Italy), Edinburgh (Scotland), Berlin (Germany), Zurich (Switzerland)...|`|7o3DMzXQaa	well for one they said it because they were making small talk (had you said you were from any other country, they would most likely have told you they would like to visit that country) and for two, many people love to travel no matter the destination. they just want to see the world|`|RY1xuwzoaa	Well, apart from the scenery and historical sites, you have to remember that a very large portion of American's are Irish.  A much larger portion than other European countries because the Irish immigration to the US in the 1800's was on a massive scale.<br>  <br>  So, for many of us, our family tree includes a great great grandmother and grandfather who took a boat ride 150 years ago :)|`|dAn9koABaa	because there granny and grandad came from Ireland ,,they want to find their roots , just the same as the english looking for their roots in Ireland ,,the Irish have populated most of the world|`|lcg1u1U7aa	If you had ever spent a few years living in west Texas you might understand why.  There is a lot of America that isn't scenic in any possible meaning of the word.  Some times we just need a change of scene and a trip to someplace really different is what we need.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	They have this notion that it's full of castles .... not that you can visit most of those castles. But there are many unused tower-houses still dotting the countryside, I can think of 2 within 3 miles of my house. I think that when these people think 'castle', they're thinking of a Bunratty-type effort, which is NOT the original castle - Bunratty castle was a ruin, and underwent extensive renovation to bring it back to its previous state. Not many castles in Ireland are like Bunratty, in fact considering the number of castles that were built, very few have survived intact, and fewer still are actually used. <br>  <br>  You're right, Ireland isn't any better than any other country, but it's certainly nicer than a lot of places. But then I am biased.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	The heritage of the majority of Americans is Irish-American or German-American, so it's probably that they want to see where their grandparents or great grandparents originated.<br>  <br>  It's just different than what they are used to, just as people from cold areas like the UK love to visit sunnier climes. To someone in a sunny beach town, they probably wonder why tourists make such a fuss over the weather. It's also likely that they were just making conversation and being friendly. We say the same things to French and English people...we are just curious about other places.|`|7oA361fbaa	Because a lot of Americans have Irish ancestry so they feel a connection with Ireland, plus we have a strong culture and Ireland really is a beautiful Island - As someone above said, the landscape would be very different to what most Americans are used to.|`|f3LrMhqWaa	it's the whole culture, history and ancestry!oh and the green!last year, was selling shamrock badges for charity and a bunch of american tourists came over and bought them all cos i said they were "lucky!"lol
AA12068233	You should Try the W, because of the Sundial. The W is like 800 feet tall and you have a great view from up there.  The Ritz Carlton is also probably one of the nicest hotels in the city as well.|`|VALo05Zdaa	why not Chateau Elan?  that place is famous for romantic weekends.|`|vNeTmHu9aa	Try the 4 Seasons.  They installed a spa in the hotel about a year ago.
sTs5ozILaa	really freaking expensive.<br>  <br>  my ex lived in the UK and I got a phone bill in the mail, for over $1,000 not knowing it was that expensive to call over there. Your best bet would be to use Skype online and get a headset, its so much cheaper. Or Vonage.

LQuRFoEMaa	No, sorry.  If you are using a package tracking service provided by either FedEx or UPS, the package status must say "out for delivery" in order for it to be delivered today. If it is at the hub by your house, however, it is possible it will be delivered later today. There should be a line on the page that says Estimated Delivery:   that's usually a good tool to follow.
4BYyCCUhaa	If you drive in off-peak hours, it will take you less than 3 hours by car. I believe there is also a train you can take that is a little shorter.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Yes you can take a plane, but I don't know why you would want to. <br>  <br>  I live in Los Angeles and drive to Mexico/San Diego all the time. It takes about three and a half hours depending on traffic.|`|72f802b5a9052f334cc57c6950295e3caa	A good way would be the Union Station to Union Station train (same name both cities). I can't remember the train names, I think it's something like the Pacific Coastliner or something like that...|`|VCzsfVM5aa	it would take a couple hours at most with traffic.  You may also want  to look at the train, cheap way and takes an hour and 20 mins  and you can have a few drinks and relax.|`|xDvtRVBJaa	2 hours with no traffic. <br>  up to 3 with heavy traffic.
vkIqaFQ1aa	UK is comprised of England,Scotland Wales and Northerrn Ireland.<br>  <br>  Great Britain is the main island of England, Scotland and Wales and governed from the Houses of parliament in Westminster in London, along with Northern Ireland.  The Republic of Ireland has it's own parliament.   <br>  <br>  The difference in nationalities is as follows. <br>  <br>  British <br>  To hold a genuine British passport one must have been born in England, Scotland,Wales or Northern Ireland. <br>  One of the British Commonwealth countries or have resided in one of the above mentioned countries and fill a number of other criteria. <br>  <br>  English, Scottish or Welsh, one must have been born in England, Scotland or Wales. No where else will do!!<br>  <br>  England is not an island, it is part of the British Isles. The main island comprises England, Scotland and Wales. Ireland is a separate island split politically into two.. Northern Ireland is governed largely by the British government situated in Westminster, in London, England. The republic of Southern Ireland is self governing, independent, and not part of Great Britain or of the UK. (United Kingdom).<br>  <br>  So to be British one must have a claim to belonging to one of the British countries mentioned. <br>  <br>  For instance, to be English one must be just that, totally English and then one becomes British also. <br>  Likewise to be Scottish, Welsh or Irish but from the northern part.<br>  <br>  So in a nutshell. UK is Great Britain and Northern Ireland.<br>  <br>  Great Britain is England, Scotland and Wales. Bordered by Atlantic Ocean, Irish Sea, North Sea and English Channel.<br>  <br>  Personally I prefer to be known as English because essentially that is what I am. <br>  <br>  I am also proud to be British, because that too is my birthright. <br>  <br>  I abhor the tag ' Brit' it sounds like something you might break your teeth on!!! LOL<br>  <br>  I hope this clarifies thing for you a bit. We are nothing like America in the way things are set up. It is mainly because of the history, the battles and age old politics.<br>  <br>  To understand all of this you may like to study a map of our country, then it will become very clear.<br>  <br>  Thank you for a good Q. have a star. ☆<br>  <br>  EDIT.<br>  TDs for having a clue and being right!!!!!!!  <br>  Have you nowt better to do than go around TDing. LOL|`|uRKZkBfjaa	Yes it is confusing! The United Kingdom is made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That is why we are known as the UK. We are also called Great Britain. <br>  <br>  If you look at a map you will see that England has borders with Wales and Scotland and together are one island.<br>  <br>  Northern Ireland shares a border with Southern Ireland (Eire) and is one island too. But Southern Ireland is not part of the UK.|`|8Jl7ql9Saa	England + Scotland + Wales = Great Britain<br>  <br>  England + Scotland + Wales + Northern Ireland = United Kingdom<br>  <br>  England + Scotland + Wales + Northern Ireland + Eire (southern Ireland) = British Isles.|`|BxLzxDo9aa	The United Kingdom is an ISLAND and is made up of Different countries. WALES is a different country to England etc|`|7oA361fbaa	Britain is an Island which consists of England, Scotland and Wales.<br>  The United Kingdom is a sovereign state which is made up of Britain plus Northern Ireland, so:<br>  <br>  UK = England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.<br>  <br>  England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all Countries.<br>  <br>  The UK and Britain are not the same thing as a few of the others have incorrectly stated.<br>  <br>  The Island of Ireland (which is the island beside Britain) is made up of two countries:<br>  Northern Ireland (Which is part of the UK) <br>  and The Republic of Ireland, which as the name suggests, is a republic and is not part of the United Kingdom.|`|IKCxj9gHaa	Great Britain is the geographical name of the Island<br>  the Island has three different countries on it, England, Scotland and Wales.<br>  The three countries along with the provence of Northern Island (Ulster) are joined together politically into one state called the United Kingdom.

Use a European-based flight comparison engine like Momondo or Skyscanner to find the cheapest tickets.<br>  <a href="http://momondo.com" rel="nofollow">http://momondo.com</a><br>  <a href="http://skyscanner.net" rel="nofollow">http://skyscanner.net</a><br>  <br>  A 2-star hotel in major French/Italian cities starts around €80 for a double room. If you stay in smaller cities, this can be cheaper.<br>  <br>  €60 per day (per person) for food is a reasonable amount if you eat all your meals in cafés and decent restaurants (not including drinks). It's possible to eat on less per day (minimum €30 if you eat street food and in cheap restaurants), and nice restaurants can be much more expensive.<br>  <br>  Travel between cities depends on how many cities, and whether you fly or take a train. Budget airlines are a good choice, you can often find flights for €30 or less.

1FPpglMpaa	South Brooklyn.. Sheepshead Bay, Brighton Beach, Midwood, Homecrest, Gravesend, Bay Ridge... These are all solid middle/working class neighborhoods.  some of the old  groups still remain(Italian, Jewish, Irish,black) and have been supported by the newcomers (not so new anymore.. over 3 decades now) Russian,Asian,Middle Eastern, via new stores, foods, accents, traditions etc... but that is what Brooklyn and NY in general has always been about...|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	i think large swatches of Sunset Park still retain your sense of the "old Brooklyn"...
Lmw6dtQvaa	Here is my list of top 5 Chinese youtube clones, but make sure you stay tuned till the end, because the +1 is a real gem! The neato thing about most of these sites is that they can host shared/stolen content for everyone to enjoy/report.<br>  <br>  <br>  So here are the top 5<br>  <br>  5.<a href="http://www.mofile.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mofile.com</a><br>  <br>  A lot of web-cammery, a decent tags section, these guys break my top 5 — even though I haven’t used them too much. Looks good though, as you can see from this White Stripes Video，Seven Nation Army:<br>  <br>  4. <a href="http://www.6rooms.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.6rooms.com</a><br>  <br>  You can find some stuff on here, but it’s more difficult than some of the other sites. I’m usually not too impressed with them, but I am today. They earn my 4-spot, mostly because they have Spiderman 3 online!

Layout seems very similar to youtube, and ease of use is quite good (maybe because it’s a familiar layout?). Because tudou has been going for so long, there’s already a good base of users, and a good base of videos posted.<br>  <br>  1. <a href="http://www.youku.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.youku.com</a><br>  <br>  This site’s domain used to be yuqoo.com, but I guess they decided to change it for some reason or another. I wonder why? In anycase, despite their resemblance to youtube, I’m crowning youku the king of Chinese internet video sites. It’s ease of use, and blistering speed puts youtube to shame. And it seems to be the only Chinese video site with a user base that can rival tudou.
