hE9FleIVaa	I love Bennihanna's!!!!. It is Tappan Style Japanese/Chinese food. You sit around a huge grill and a chef cooks your food in front of you and does some entertaining tricks like flips shrimp into your mouth, builds a volcano out of onions....and some other cool stuff too. They have the best fried rice I have ever eaten and the other food is great too. Kind of expensive but its been worth it everytime I have gone. |`|3wFzzwvKaa	Their fried rice is the best of any of the Japanese restaurants.|`|4FyJM8hhaa	What a dumb question.|`|V5TC4x6jaa	way more expensive but awesome its like a hibachi where they grill in front of you and do all sorts of tricks with the food totally awesome.|`|wzwta3Y0aa	Uhmmm not at all... but maybe you are the type of girl that should get a job at hooters.|`|AA10268618	No, it is a teppan style resturant. All that means is they cook the food at your table on a grill built in to the table.
KhoqJ5Nqaa	You can pay with cash! Make sure you do some research on how much the items on the menu are so you can be sure to bring enough!    The check normally comes in what looks like a folder (probably the pad you're seeing..) When you and your date tell the waitress you're finished, she'll leave it at the edge of the table. Grab it right away so your date has no question about who's paying.    When you see the total, your tip should be roughly 15% of it. If your state tax is 7.5-8% you can cheat by just doubling the tax on the bill. As a reference for $20-25 you should tip around 5$, 25-30 tip $6, go up a dollar for every $10 after that.    Good luck and have fun!|`|VvbOSbRnaa	They just put it in the folder to make the check presentation look better and also for people to either put their credit card in or the cash. You can place the cash right in the folder. If you had good service, just add about 20% to to the total bill and leave that for the server. |`|sGoEj6qsaa	Just pay with cash.  Tip is 15-20% of the pre-tax bill|`|L90GsiO2aa	You put cash in the folder. If you have the exact amount you can put that in, if not the server will bring you change. You can then leave your tip, in cash, in the folder or on the table. You only sign the bill if you are paying by credit card or if you are in a hotel and charging the bill to your room.|`|AA12033220	You can pay cash but if it makes you feel better, you can get a Visa gift card that works exactly like a credit card. You can purchase one at your bank.     It is customary to tip 15%, but if you want to impress a girl you should tip a little more. I usually do 20% and round up to the next dollar.     Good luck to you!|`|b4YX72hBaa	You look up at the waiter/ress and say, "I'm a teen!" and they say you don't have to pay.          Not really.  Use cash money. Be sure to wait for your change.  Don't you have parents to ask this kind of stuff?  Pay attention next time you're at restaurant at how people pay.  People often pay with a debit card, if you have a bank account you can get one.  It's basically a card that acts as a personal check.  They are usually backed by a major credit card company like Visa so you can use them where they do not accept debit cards, you charge it as you would a credit card.  The difference is that the money doesn't come out of your account as quickly as a debit card transaction would.  Be careful though because they often charge fees for with-drawls or like 60 cents for using it at an establishment.  Go to the bank if you want to apply for one and ask how you use a debit card, read any information pamphlets they provide you and be SMART with your money.  God knows we could use more people who are smart about their money in this economy.  It's a good idea because a debit card is safer to carry then cash.  If it is stolen or lost you can report it to your bank and they will cancel it and return any money that was wrongly charged as with a credit card.  I would discuss it with your parents, its a good tool to teach a kid how money works.  Believe it or not, money is a lot more complicated then you'd think.|`|pRKRw2R8aa	cash of course and 15% or you can double the tax. (tax is different in every state i live in new york and tax is higher, the doubling of the tax rule may not be acceptable in states with a low tax)|`|uVy8yEjLaa	pay with money.and it is 15% of your bill for the tip.|`|dafae2ae3b86a68e315dfbc92b268dc5aa	Pay  the  old  way,  used  for  decades .   .   .   $  Cash  $    Tip  is  15%  of  the  bill  for  normal  service ,  More  if  you  think  they  were  spoiling  you .    Have  fun  on  the  date  !    Tip  example  $20    dinner  bill =  $3   tip .    >|`|b8MqIU5Vaa	You shouldn't have to worry about using a credit card; restaurants accept cash.  As far as tipping goes, it is courteous to tip at least 15%.  To figure this out, you can do one of two things.  1) Some cell phones have a tip calculator in the tools menu.  2)Do the math in your head. For example, if your total is $25.07, you can easily find ten percent($2.54; you just move the decimal one place to the left.) Then you split ten percent($2.54) in half, and add it to the ten percent.($2.54+1.27=3.81) This would give you fifteen percent.|`|xt3NIXn3aa	cash and for the tip, say the bill is $85 and you leave $15 dollars tip, just put $100 in the padded envelope thing and say no change. they should ask you if you need change or not. Good Luck!|`|LaFklYyzaa	:) how cute. cash sweety. bring the money in 10 dollar bills. that way you wont have to worry about them bringing a bunch of change back and when you put the cash in the folder they bring you with your bill just tell the waiter i don't need change and then you're good to go. besides, it looks good to your date. :)|`|pg5AHNcdaa	Simple, just cash. Generally 15% for a tip with good service and good food. Could go lower or higgher. whatever you want. don't leave too big a tip trying to impress someone. The cash could be used for much better stuff!|`|aeGVVMfsaa	TIP- give a little money like 5 dollars    PAY-cash     caps locks i'm not screaming i just put it there because i don't have a bold|`|6r3tvGRAaa	cash duh|`|064650ea1d78d91b4791df02ac479011aa	with cash|`|a5f0410e8f119074238a8fceda8f4787aa	money get a job|`|58BVQST9aa	pay with cash. $5 tip maximum.

It's as much of a scam as the lottery, in that your odds of winning anything substantial are highly unlikely.    If it were a scam, they just wouldn't make winning pieces. They're trying to increase sales and are creating an incentive for the consumer in the form of a contest.|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	I've always thought these types of things were because the only thing that I've ever won was a free bunch of fries or a drink.  I have never even heard of anyone winning any money at all except for the person that mentions it on this page.|`|AA11386158	My friend won $100 on an instant win. So I don't think it's that much of a scam. But they do have to distribute it to the entire US so you're not going to find that many winning pieces if they can just make you think you're going to win and make you buy more delicious Mickey D's! lol
gXnpcX6Daa	I'm a vegetarian and i have a hard time trying to source for romantic vegetarian restaurants to impress my girl and I totally agree with brokenbudgie that Original Sin is one of the most romantic place you can get.     While Ling Zhi is posh and offers oriental crusines, the ambience there is not comparable with Original Sin. In fact, it is jus another chinese restaurant to me.    Roma Deli is another nice romantic cafe restaurant. They offer main courses and set dinners. Most importantly is that the place is nice and cosy and especially good for couples. It's not really posh, however the slightly dark settings brings out the ambience. The prices are also very much attractive if you are not intending to spend too much on the dinners but increasing the value of the present you are giving.     http://icyelite.wordpress.com/2008/07/27...    There is another amazing site that i've come across that offers gifts if you are thinking of suprising her. The web is unlike the normal online retail that offers you a wide range of products according to your budget and leave you with the hassle of picking and chosing. They are the Giftideasgenerator, and they actually solve problems for us. All you need to do is to fill in ur own particulars and also the recipient particulars, personal traits and interesting characters options and finally chose a price range that you are comfortable to pay. They will do the rest by chosing a suitable and customised gift and send it to the door step of ur love ones. U've got to give it a shot. I've tried it and to my amaze, the present they've got for me on behalf for my girl was interesting and daring. It not only suprises her, but me as well!     http://www.giftideasgenerator.com/|`|VXcp8hvHaa	not a clue|`|HEEXkiihaa	try the vegetarian restaurant at bishan park...its really nice but forgot the name...try checking out hungrygowhere site...they may have it|`|PDotv2Hsaa	Original Sin, at Jalan Merah Saga (Holland Village) is rather nice if a little pricey.

The food here is good too.  http://www.lingzhivegetarian.com/|`|97e85b6fd730d5a0150fb9caefff2677aa	marche at Vivocity can whip out the best salads !  and the atmosphere is nice|`|OXYMYOjeaa	you can go to the shaw tower there...there is a vegetarian restaurant selling western and chinese style cooking food...i have tried it and is very delicious especially the service is good there...i hoped you and your wife will enjoy the food there lol...For the restaurant name,i have forgotten liao lol
Fsr2Rofzaa	What kind of rest. are you going to?  Never in my life have I dined or worked in a rest, where this happens.  The only time a "replacement" server comes on is if the table are complete azzes and the server can't deal with them anymore.  Servers wait for their break|`|farhj0Kiaa	I am a waitress and A couple weeks ago, I had a party of 25 and I needed another servers help. Since we sectioned the party mentally, we split the tips straight down the middle. At another restaurant I worked at, we had server assistance and with that I would just break off whatever I felt they deserved. But definitely split it 50/50.  I work at California Pizza Kitchen and used to work at Dave and Busters!|`|m1V5ws73aa	You split it.|`|RxBe4y3Waa	that's strange. i've never heard of a server going on break and another server filling in during break. are you sure it wasn't just another server running out your food? because the likelihood of your server running out your food is slim, in most restaurant what ever server is there when the food comes up runs it out. i've been a server over 20 years, i've never had a break, or had another server fill in for me. i have however had customers give half my tip to someone i am training! which i hate! the trainee gets minimum wage, i get $2.13 an hour and i don't want my tips going in some new guy's pocket!|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I've never really heard of this situation unless the first server was on a short smoke break or maybe he was just having another server cover his back while eating. It sounds like the first server. I personally like to take care of my tables on my own and try not to take breaks while doing so|`|AA10804824	I'm with Jenny K. I've never heard of a server getting a break. Your best bet is to tip according to the overall service you recieve.   The last place I worked, the rule was whoever bussed the table got the tip (ie whoever stayed with the table). If you need to leave THAT BAD you forfiet the tip.  i have often been confused when I go out by how many people approach my table. there's a water guy, wine guy, food runner, server. But keep in mind, your server has to tip all these people, too.|`|pueeMH6gaa	It varies from restaurant to restaurant.  A lot of times, if you leave cash, the first person back to the table will just pocket the money and tell the other one that the customer didn't leave a tip.  Sorry to say, but a lot of waiters and waitresses are thieves.|`|Dg4lLq5Haa	There might be a way in the restaurant whereby all the tips are collected into a jar and are split evenly throughout the staff, but then again, that wouldn't work because there are always the few that work harder than others and wouldn't get rewarded for it properly.|`|a0ba9a8354b58d576f00709d3e7d9584aa	Hi,  I'm a server, and this constantly happens to me. We have a rule that we're not allowed to take parties of 6 or more by ourselves, so we have to split it. We don't have an actualy 'proceedure' but I ALWAYS split the tips 50/50  no matter how good or bad the other server who helped me was. It's only fair. But other resturants have diff. ways of doing it.    answer mine?|`|k8HpMaHxaa	It depends on the server really.    If it hits 4:00 and you want to get out of there, we will usually forfeit the tip to go home. Sometime we may split it in half, or in some cases it depends on how far along the table was in their meal. If server 1 only took the order and drinks, and server 2 served them for the remainder of the meal, server 2 gets the tip.|`|LkDgsxGbaa	I agree with Maggie C., but then again I usually do.  I've been a server for 25 years and I have never heard of a manager allowing a server to take a break, if they have tables in the dining room. Most restaurants I have worked at, the servers work this out amongst themselves.  I would suggest tipping on the quality of service and the servers will make sure it is split fairly.  Another poster stated that servers are thieves, which I feel is an unfair characterization.  In my 25 years I have never had a problem with a fellow server stealing tips.  I have had bussers and other customers steal tips, but never a server.  Politicians, bankers, doctors, lawyers, the list goes on and on have been guilty of thievery yet people love to treat restaurant employees as dregs of society.  If you feel strongly about where your tip is going, simply ask your server how the tip is dispersed and then do what you feel is fair in that situation.|`|jXL6BupUaa	It sounds to me more like you are there at shift change and your first server wants to leave and doesn't want to wait around for you to leave.  If this is the case as it usually is at the restaurant I work at then the second server is the one to cash you out so they keep the tip unless they choose to share it with the first table, but if they forfeit the table usually they forfeit the tip as well.  You can always ask the second server and they will probably tell you the truth about what is happening to your tip.  If they say that they split it than you can always tip extra and tell them how much of the tip you want to go to them and how much should go to the 1st server.
