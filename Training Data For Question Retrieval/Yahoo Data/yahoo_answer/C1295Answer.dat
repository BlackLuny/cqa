8dffbce3266bc6eb44bbe27559482b26aa	"alpha,beta" notation is no longer used in the standard IUPAC naming system.  In that notation, a central entity was identified as the one of importance, and if there was stuff other than hydrogen hanging off a carbon structure connected to the central entity, the first carbon next to it was the alpha carbon, the next, the beta carbon, and so on.   <br>  <br>  As an example, sulfur mustard is (CH2Cl-CH2)2-S.   Nowdays (I believe) this is named as a thioether.  In the earlier system, it was called beta, beta'-dichloroethylsulfide.

In some cases, although the drugs may have bioequivalency (meaning the do the same thing) they may be different in other ways.  For example, some generic meds have different pharmacokinetics because of the way the generic is formulated or compounded.  Differences in additives, buffering or other manufacturing techniques may result in less of the drug getting into your blood or time to reach maximum concentration may be longer.  The drugs generally will have the same overall effect and frankly, the differences just noted may not be noticeable to the patient, but they are there.|`|L9f4HX0Qaa	Usually, the drug itself is the same. What is different are usually the adjuvants or additional things that are put into the drug to make it work. These might result in slightly more side-effects, or bitter taste, etc. But nothing serious. According to the FDA, a drug needs to show bioequivalence. A generic drug needs to show the same biological effect with about the same toxicity that a name brand drug would.

It has specific biological effects and influences neurotransmitters in the brain. It is basically a "fake" version of a natural neurotransmitter that is temporally increased. <br>  <br>  In Eastern medicine there are not really "drugs," chemicals Synthesized or extracted. Acupuncture does not change how your neurotransmitters work (at least not directly). In the west drugs have big effects, Eastern herbs are very light. <br>  <br>  And The West has companies that make medications for profit. It takes a lot of time to make a drug and just think about what these drugs can do- stop pain, keep you awake, make you sleep, kill invading bacterial cells, and so much more.

In addition, men who are overweight or have large stomachs may fail to allow for the partial concealment of the penis by their abdomen. The accumulation of fat on the pubic bone above the penis may give a shorter appearance even though the length of the penis from the base is normal.<br>  Compared to other primates, even larger primates such as the gorilla, the male human genitalia are remarkably large. The human penis is both longer and thicker than that of any other primate both in absolute terms and in relative size compared to the rest of the body.|`|BGIxDWkZaa	There is some truth to this. Severely over weight males may lose up to three inches. This, like many things in life, is not always the case. It is however a rule of thumb. They do not actually "lose" the inches forever.

4c1e07d9ba0c2d099d9db46ee34af35faa	DNA is really a very simple structure - 4 bases Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T). These bases are joined one to another in a long chain. The order they are is the important thing as this is what eventually determines which amino acids will make up new proteins.<br>  <br>  As you know DNA is a double helix so there are actually 2 chains of bases. Each base on one strand always has the same partner on the other. So if you have an A on one strand then it will always be joined to a T on the other strand and the same for G and C.<br>  <br>  Sections of DNA which can be converted into proteins are called genes. When the protein product of a specific gene is needed the double helix is opened up at that point. The string of bases on one strand is copied to a new molecule called RNA, specifically messenger RNA (mRNA), the sequence stays the same, except that mRNA uses uracil (U) instead of T. This process is called transcription.<br>  <br>  When the mRNA molecule is completed it leaves the nucleus and goes to a ribosome where it binds to ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Here the message is 'read' three bases at a time. Each group of three bases is called a codon and each codon corresponds to a particular amino acid. To get from codons to amino acids a third type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) is needed. Each tRNA molecule has 2 parts, on one side of the molecule is an anti-codon which binds to the mRNA and on the other side is the amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon. As each tRNA binds to the mRNA enzymes join the amino acid carried on the other part of the molecule and the protein chain is made. This process is called translation.<br>  <br>  Here is an example: if you have a codon UUU on your mRNA, the tRNA with the anticodon AAA will bind to it and the other part of that tRNA molecule will always carry the amino acid phenylalanine, so every time there is a sequence TTT in the DNA it will become UUU in the mRNA and then phenyalanine in the protein.<br>  <br>  With 4 bases in DNA read in groups of 3, there is the potential for 64 different amino acids. However there are only 20 amino acids, so there is more than one codon for most amino acids. e.g. the codons UUU and UUC both code for phenylalanine.<br>  <br>  There are four special codons:  AUG is the start codon and is the only one to code for the amino acid methionine which comes at the beginning of each new protein chain. UAA, UAG and UGA are stop codons and when one of these is reached, protein synthesis ends as these do not have a corresponding amino acid.<br>  <br>  The link below shows the genetic code, i.e. which codons code for each amino acid and a bit more discussion of how the whole things work, with some diagrams. A few more technicalities are mentioned, but just ignore these for AS level.|`|gf0tOrcpaa	Ok, there are a few things wrong with the things you have said.  DNA is not a process its a molecule deoxyribose Nucleic Acid.  This is what DNA is made up of, it is a Deoxyribose sugar backbone with Nucleic Acids attached to it.  Nucleic acids are also called bases these hold the information within the DNA.  Amino acids on the other hand make up proteins.  They do not read off bases but they do bind to them during translation.  However transcription of DNA into RNA must happen first.  To do this a protein called Polymerase binds to DNA and pairs A with U and C with G (these are bases of RNA).  so you get a sequence that looks like AUUCGGGCCUUACUACUUACC blah blah blah.  Then ribosomes in the cell bind to those RNA molecules and make a protein sequence.  Amino acids are so big they bind to 3 bases at a time, so AUU binds with one amino acid (This is called a reading frame, and the triplet code is known as a codon).  This results in a protein sequence of amino acid.  Hoped this helped.  If not heres some sources for you to take a look at.|`|1305765249b53f290c467decdedb9e3aaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PKjF7OumYo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PKjF7Oum...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jtmOZaIvS0&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jtmOZaIv...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41_Ne5mS2ls&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41_Ne5mS2...</a>

TlXLKVEOaa	no joke i think she more help then she knows..|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	Peak oil is the theory that we have (or shortly will) pass the halfway point in the use of Earth's deposits of petroleum.<br>  <br>  Historically, every oil field goes through a "bell curve" in its rate of oil extraction. As more oil wells are dug, the curve of the extraction rate, usually in barrels of oil per day, rises. But when the oil is half gone, the curve stops rising and starts falling.<br>  <br>  Oil companies have learned tricks by which they can keep the flow rate at or near the maximum for longer. One of them is pumping seawater into the oil well to make the remaining oil float upward. But none of these tricks adds any additional oil to what was in the ground already, and the AREA under the extraction rate curve remains constant. What the tricks do is cause the drop-off, when it comes, to be more sudden: sharper in its downward slope toward empty.<br>  <br>  The largest oil field in the world, Ghawar in Saudi Arabia, is being kept artificially high with the seawater treatment. When it goes, it will go fast.<br>  <br>  Countries with multiple oil fields also go through a bell curve in their domestic oil extraction. The national bell curve is the sum of the bell curves of all the individual oil fields in the country. The United States is already far along on the downslope of its domestic extraction curve.<br>  <br>  The entire world, likewise, has a generally bell-shaped curve to its oil extraction rate. The world's extraction curve is the sum of the bell-curves of all the individual countries that produce oil. The world is thought to have passed its peak in the year 2004, except for the "tricks" that oil companies use to keep the extraction rate artificially high for a time.<br>  <br>  The economic system of the United States is based on a financial trick called "monetized debt." Banks loan money into existence at interest, but they do not print and give away the extra money that would be needed to repay the interest. Although some of the users of money can clear themselves of debt by clever trading or by hard work, the country as a whole cannot do so. No one can get out of debt except by making someone else's debt troubles worse.<br>  <br>  What was keeping this economic system from collapsing was the fact that money is really just a token for energy, or for items whose value had been improved by the application of energy. As long as fossil fuels kept flowing in at higher and higher and ever-higher rates, the geologically-assisted producers of the country could stay ahead of default on their bank obligations.<br>  <br>  However, an exponentially increasing consumption of energy is REQUIRED to meet the exponentially increasing financial obligation of these interest payments. A merely constant level of energy consumption will not suffice. The economy would collapse as the interest pulled ahead of the means to pay it with goods. And after Peak Oil, at some point, the availability of energy resources won't even remain constant: on the contrary, it will shrink.<br>  <br>  Uh oh.<br>  <br>  Wars and overpopulation are major drains on energy resources.<br>  <br>  National security is affected by wars. Overpopulation leads to famine and disease, and so it is one of the reasons that wars can occur.|`|iLozr2aSaa	These questions have nothing to do with Astronomy.

Fx2AFpFiaa	Don't let people that dont believe in God tell you he doesnt exist. First off good job for being able to sick up for what you believe in. Unfortunately schools teach evolution as the only theory but with very minimal study otside of textbooks you can very easily see that there are major gaps missing. I wrote a research paper on the two theories, I already believed in Creationism without a doubt, but sought out to find proof against Evolution. There are a lot of really good websites that I used and they helped a lot: <br>  www.allaboutthejourney.org this one had great information about the fossil record. There is a quote by Charles Darwin (the one who came up with the theory of evolution) <br>  <br>  "Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed." <br>  <br>  There hasnt been a single one of these intermediate varieties found in the fossil record. The man who came up with the theory of evolution discovered that it didn't make sense and yet people continue to believe it. <br>  <br>  There are countless other problems with the theory of evolution. The actual start of life is something that has never been able to be recreated. Scientist pass this off as no big deal but if they cant even figure out how the first form of life was created then the rest doesnt even matter. The evolution between sex organs is another conondrum. Scientist dont know why a species would all of a sudden be able to have the eggs inside and keep the fetus inside compared to "the previous ancestor" as evolutionists believe who laid eggs. <br>  <br>  Also look at the Cambrian explosion. This goes completely agains the theory of evolution. According to the evolutionary changes it says that new species will be developed by subtle and gradual changes. The cambrian explosion is a sudden appearance of billions of species, many of which are still alive today. As you probably know this goes right along with what the Bible states. <br>  <br>  I think everyone should research both sides for themselves to see what really makes sense for them. Dont just believe a school text book because they can easily mislead you. <br>  <br>  A great book is The Case for a Creater by Lee Strobel. He was a skeptic trying to disprove the theory of creaionism/intelligent design but through his research he discovers the truth. It is a very informative book any skeptics on either side of the issue should read it.<br>  <br>  Again don't worry about what narrow-minded people ^ say. You know the truth and can try to spread it but if they refuse to listen then in the end it will be their loss.|`|ns0mfMHYaa	u said there is theory and there is fact<br>  how do u know creationism is fact<br>  as far as i know that's a theory as well<br>  and i believe in evolution cuz there is <br>  evidence supproting it<br>  there is no evidence behind creationsim<br>  except that it was written in a book|`|okuvUUgfaa	I am not religious but I do not believe in Evolution|`|h4wNRqf9aa	i think cristina applegate will walk through my door and make out with me....<br>  <br>  <br>  lets hope your logic hold water<br>  <br>  <br>  you have ALOT of learning to do my friend|`|WRyHOEjSaa	If God made the earth and everything, as you say, then He made all the evidence we’ve found demonstrating evolution. That’s a lot of effort He went to to clue you in. He didn’t have to set things up so that fossils would form. He didn’t have to let endogenous retroviruses get passed from ancestor to descendant across species. If you believe in God, how can you ignore the evidence He’s left you with His own hand? Talk about insulting God!<br>  <br>  And let’s keep a few things in mind about the Bible. According to Christian belief, the Bible was inspired by God by written by men. Furthermore, it only runs counter to evolution according to certain interpretations. There are interpretations that hold the Bible runs counter to heliocentrism as well (a literal interpretation of Psalm 104:5, for instance), but you don’t have to choose those interpretations. Genesis 1 lists “days” of creation, but those are from God’s point of view, not ours. Genesis 2 says Adam was formed from the dust of the ground, but evolution says nothing to gainsay that – just that there were many intervening steps. There are Biblical genealogies that suggest the earth is only 6,000 years old, but the Bible itself tells you (twice) not to give heed to genealogies (1Tim 1:4, Titus 3:9). Christ himself taught in parables, and summarized all the specific, literal requirements of the law with two simple commandments. He did not expect anyone to assume the literal truth of His lessons or of the Bible in contradiction of the evidence around them. Are you really going to tell everyone here that Christ’s example isn’t good enough for you, and that you hold your personal interpretation of a work of man in higher esteem than evidence left directly by God?|`|KfBWOvf3aa	the problem is that, so far, evolution seems true, but creation seems wrong. another problem: why sometimes people interpret holy scripture so fast and with overconfidence, but when it turns out to be wrong, they silence immediately? for example, in middle age, religious people believed that earth is flat and earth is the center of the universe. there are few sentences in the bible that say these explicitly. this belief made religious people at that time had serious problems with scientists. however, when they already proven wrong, where are their overconfidence? now, there are no people fight the facts that earth is sphere and not the center of the universe, instead they are countering evolution and big bang. later, if we find hard prove that big bang and evolution are true, what will you do? why you never think this way: what if my interpretation is wrong??? because this has happened many times in the past.<br>  <br>  if you want to find out what evolution really is, this is a very good link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13620-evolution-24-myths-and-misconceptions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13...</a><br>  <br>  this link adreesses important points which ordinary (and religious) people have misunderstood. this is one of them: because evolution is based on survival of the fittest principle, then this justifies cruelty and competition in our world, to make oneself the best and conquer the other. this is simply WRONG. I will quote directly from the link:<br>  <br>  ".....in reality the word "fittest" seldom means the strongest or the most aggressive. On the contrary, it can mean anything from the best camouflaged or the most fecund to the cleverest or the most cooperative............Cooperation is an incredibly successful survival strategy. Indeed it has been the basis of all the most dramatic steps in the history of life..."<br>  <br>  so, if someone can open his mind, actually evolution teaches us that the best strategy to survive is by COOPERATION (to some extent). just read it yourself.<br>  <br>  don't get me wrong. I am a scientist. as a scientist, I believe there is something beauty, something spiritual about this universe. however, the way of religious people are wrong. they always force people to follow their interpretation (without realizing there is a possibility that it is wrong), and threat and discourage other people who disagree by hell for eternity. that is just wrong, in my opinion. if you want to prove that creation is true, prove it scientifically. not by ignorance.<br>  <br>  and this is the most important point: it is you, who is insulted (because it contradicts your belief, your interpretation). GOD is never insulted by anyone or anything.|`|el0ry6nXaa	God is a theory. There is no real proof that he exists. There are other examples of evolution all around us that we know for a fact are true.

Pylori in the stomach are incorrect.  Here is why: H. Pylori enters stomach (urea is already in the stomach), H. Pylori produces urease (an enzyme) and urease breaks down into ammonia. The pH increases and “clouds” the bacteria creating a non-acidic environment (stomach usually maintains a pH of about 2).

Ftkr9jqYaa	1. Occasionally homologous chromosomes fail to seperate during meiosis I. Using the hypothetical example of an adult organism that has two pairs of chromosomes, escribe the chromosomal makeup of the eggs that would result from this error in meiosis. <br>  <br>  If halving of the chromosomes fails (i.e., if nondisjunction occurs), then some of the eggs will be lacking a copy of a chromosome, while others will be polyploid (i.e., diploid).<br>  <br>  2. If normal human sperm fertilized the eggs described above (in question 1), what would the chromosomal makeup of the resulting zygote be? <br>  <br>  The zygotes will be Trisomic (trisomy = having three copies of a chromosome) or Monosomic (monosomy = having only one copy of a chromosome), which often results in phenotypic abnormalities, infertility, or lethality.<br>  <br>  3. How do independent assortment, crossing-over, and random fertilization affect the rate of evolution?<br>  <br>  These phenomena all increasing the genetic variability of offspring, which increases the likelihood that some offspring will have greater fitness than the parents, and consequently the rate of evolution is accelerated.<br>  <br>  4. A student states that organisms that reproduce asexually are at a disadvantage in a stable environment. If you agree with this hypothesis, name one or more of its strengths. If you disagree, name one or more of its weaknesses.<br>  <br>  There are few advantages to asexual reproduction.  One is that it doesn't require a sexual partner or pollen transfer, so it is very quick and guaranteed.<br>  <br>  The main disadvantage of binary fission or vegetative reproduction, forms of asexual reproduction, is that the offspring will all grow very close to each other and to the parent. This will cause a struggle for soil, nutrients and light, and will consequently cause the offspring to be less healthy than is likely with sexual reproduction with reproductive dispersal.<br>  <br>  A disadvantage of fragmentation, another form of asexual reproduction in plants, is that if the plant is in located in a poor habitat, it is unlikely to thrive or reproduce.<br>  <br>  Asexual reproduction via spores only succeeds if environmental conditions are suitable for spore growth and maturation.<br>  <br>  The major disadvantage of asexual reproduction, however, is the lack of genetic diversity in the offspring, which is particularly undesirable in an unstable environment.

awCnTJ8daa	You know, occasionally, I've heard claims such as these as well.  But, when you need to use an extension to torque a bolt you have to use it.  Anyway, I've thought about it and the only loss that I could see would be the torsional flexing of the extension taking a portion of the torque you intended for the fastener.<br>  <br>  Since the rotational deflection of a shaft (i.e. the extension) is directly proportional to the length of the shaft, then I would recommend using the shortest extension possible.  Also, since the rotational deflection of a shaft is inversely proportional to the shaft diameter raised to the fourth power (i.e. large stiffness change for a small increase in diameter), then I would recommend always using extensions with a diameter greater than the bolt diameter.|`|Mtck4Lzbaa	yes there is a loss. However if you get a longer handled wrench you will gain more torque.|`|BrarMA1Haa	If you apply torque to one end of a solid shaft, that torque will be transmitted without loss to the other end.  This is because there is no counter-acting force or torque applied anywhere along the shaft (eg, no friction).<br>  <br>  The longer the shaft, the more rotational deflection of the shaft will occur, but the torque wrench is impervious to that deflection because it does not use the deflection of the extension shaft to determine torque.  It measures the torque that it applies to its square drive.<br>  <br>  U-joints can be a definite problem.  The two-pivot design, when operated at a non-zero angle, causes the rotational displacement, velocity, and torque to fluctuate cyclicly twice per turn.  In automobiles where this would be a problem such as on front-wheel drive vehicles, a constant-velocity joint is used instead of a U-joint.<br>  <br>  So yes, a U-joint definitely can cause erroneous readings or tripping of the torque wrench.  Check out the third reference for measured data.<br>  <br>  Long shafts should not be a problem.  If a shaft bends sideways at all, it mantains a constant velocity (and hence no torque irregularities) since it is a continuous joint, not a two-pivot joint.<br>  <br>  Sloppy square-drive joints on multiple extension shafts might introduce error to the extent that they begin to act like a universal joint.<br>  <br>  Note:  Even with U-joints, if you can maintain a straight alignment with the bolt head, the torque error theoretically is zero.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	While you see a lot of variation in humanity, that is probably largely because you are a human and are conditioned to see it.<br>  <br>  In fact, humans are one of the LEAST diverse species on the planet.  The genetic difference between two of the most distantly related humans is actually less than that of a typical ape family.  This leads geneticists to estimate that our species went through a bottleneck about 70,000 years ago when there must have been less than 20,000 humans alive.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, for speciation to occur usually requires isolation and a whole lot of time for mutation and differential selection to occur.  Seventy thousand years is small change on evolutionary scales and these days there isn't much of anyplace that one human can be than another human can't visit.<br>  <br>  So if you want to see different species of humans, you're probably going to need the vast separation and new environments we might only see in space.  Colonists of another planet, perhaps, or a lost ship that somehow survives for a million years.  Or perhaps we might see it much sooner if genetic engineering allows us to change ourselves - some people might desire that kind of isolation or change themselves so thoroughly that they can no longer interbreed.<br>  <br>  We'll just have to wait and see.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	It's because our species lived in the same sorts of environments as the others of the genus Homo, but our species was much better at "group dynamics" than those other guys -- we could hunt in larger groups, and had better weapons and tactics, than our "cousin" species.<br>  <br>  We killed them outright, or pushed them onto marginal land where there was less food.  Eventually they became extinct.<br>  <br>  You can see the same thing happening today with the other great apes.  Gorillas and orang-utans are becoming extinct because people want to live where they live.<br>  <br>  > why isn't the humans classed as more than one species <br>  There's been a lot of interbreeding ("gene flow") and not enough isolation, so we're still all one species.  You can marry an Australian aborigine and have normal, fertile children.|`|gf0tOrcpaa	Simple answer is that we as humans are high and mighty and "theres no way we are related to chimps enough to be classified into their respective genus"(we are 99% related hence the joke here).

Like above answers the Homo Genus is not alone, we have had many ancestors that have lived along with each other all being Homo sp.|`|FwuyxxoWaa	We out-evolved the other species of the Homo genus, because we happen to be much more intelligent and have other cool features.

Humans do not have a significant amount of difference to qualify as more than one species.|`|yPf1BjAraa	The topic of species definitions is actually quite controversial in the evolutionary biology field. One of the most widely accepted versions says that If two groups can interbreed then they are the same species. Because all humans are capable of interbreeding they are one species. Also, because we are morphologically very similar we would be one species based on a different species definition. <br>  <br>  It is being debated where we came from and what happened to the other species of humans. At one time there were at least 3 different species of humans. The Neanderthals and Homo erectus were both very similar to us and examples of culture and language for these two groups have been found. And, these two groups probably overlapped with our species. However, something happened and those other species died out and we survived. <br>  <br>  The species is not evolving because we're in a state of stasis. We're constantly experiencing mutations however, if they are not advantageous or neutral then natural selection won't act upon those changes and increase their frequency. There have not been any large speciation events that affected the human race so we are still one species.|`|TQVMAZUbaa	Lots of questions: <br>  <br>  1.  There are many genus that have only one species.  There are no other animals that are genetically close enough to us to share the genus.<br>  <br>  2.  Humans are a single species because we all share enough genetic similarities and we can interbreed.  Dogs are all the same species but come in many more varied forms than humans do.  (Compare Chihuahuas and Great Danes!)<br>  <br>  3.  Species normally evolve with such minor changes over long periods of time that you would not normally notice the change during a single lifetime.|`|2gjfFsYKaa	There were several at one time.

There is also the issue that there are other massive objects around you like the Sun, the Moon, other planets. These would not make a huge difference to you as the strength of gravity varies with 1/r^2 where r is the distance from the centre of mass, and the most important mass for you would be the Earth.

Both have a regular arrangement specific to them, this is why, graphite can be used as a lubricant, diamond is very hard &, graphite can conduct electricity and diamond cant. The diagram on the paper shows why each substance has these different properties. <br>  In graphite, layers of carbons, each bonded to 3 others, are stacked on each other, these layers are held together by delocalised electrons (from the 4th untaken bond), these forces are very week and allow the layers to slip and slide over each other, perfect for a lubricant (especially in hot places due to its high melting point), and for writing (as layers slide onto the page). The delocalised electrons allow graphite to conduct electricity, as they can flow freely. Diamond, has a structure of a carbon bonded to 4 other carbons, this structure has very strong bonds (covalent) and gagged edges, and there for is very hard, and can scratch other surfaces. There are no delocalised electrons, or charged particles, so diamond is a very good insulator. ]|`|UMbr0GWYaa	Ok so, graphite is a gaint covalent structure, how ever it is a lubricant because it has delocalized electrons, and because of this it can move. <br>  This is vital to know, diamond for example is also gaint covalent but has no delocalized electrons so it is not lubricant
AA10335036	If you're wondering about the glass-to-water case, with the same incidence angle as the critical angle for water-to-air, then if Nwater/Nglass <= Nair/Nwater, you will get total internal reflection (TIR). The following description shows why. <br>  The incidence angle for TIR (see ref.) is given by<br>  theta(crit) = arcsin(N2/N1), N2 being less dense and N1 more dense (obviously, since sin(anything) can't be >1). Any incidence angle >= theta(crit) reflects internally. <br>  If the incident medium N1 is less dense than the medium on the other side of the boundary N2, there is no TIR. However that's not the case in either of the two situations you are concerned with.

Type A & B are obviously the cleanest, clearest, and most important types to consider. However, we will consider all unexplainable EVP important and worthy of presentation. Type C EVP will be given the least amount of weight, but even if we can’t clearly determine what has been recorded, the client has the right to be shown any piece of evidence, regardless of how minute. Typically, we need more than one person agreeing that we have a genuine EVP in order for them to be valid; however, if only one person hears something, but they are certain of what they’re hearing, we will present it to the client as a possible EVP and tell them nothing of what we think we hear. If they independently come up with the same conclusion as our investigator, we will determine it to be genuine and of importance.<br>  <br>  Ryan- Paranormal Investigator<br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/teamhuntingevide..." rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/teamhuntingevide...</a> <br>  (It is not against yahoo community guidelines to post your website!)|`|ZiJCUUVVaa	this is normal, everyone who has lost someone close to them experiences this. believe me i know i was in the marine corps and lost quite a few of my friends.|`|WPPIaLORaa	Nothing special.|`|QrCGQKHHaa	There are many people here that Are Wrong, Depends if you where close to the friend, Sometimes it happens because of (PDST) wich is Post dramatic stress disorder, And it happens because you cant accept that they died, but sometimes They can contat you from the other side to tell you something special that they wanted to tell you but couldnt while they where alive or just let you know that its all okay and it will be allright. if anything else please dont hesitate to email me at chrissuastegui@ymail.com

17y42pNraa	Mendel was lucky in choosing the peas because they have only 2 distinct forms for each trait. For example, there are green pods and yellow pods; there are wrinkled seeds and round seeds.  For each of the traits Mendel studied, there was a dominant form and a recessive form.  A pea plant with a heterozygous genotype (Tt) shows the dominant phenotype.  Snapdragons, on the other hand, are a classic example of incomplete dominance.  Red flowers are incompletely dominant over white. so, RR = red, rr = white, but Rr = pink, instead of red, as would be expected if it was classic dominant/recessive.  Had Mendle chosen snapdragons, he may have agreed with the thinking of the time that upon fertilization, the genes of the parents were "blended" creating all new traits, instead of concluding that each parent passes on genetic "factors" (which we call genes) that remain independent in the offspring.|`|NNii9kKBaa	do they even variate?<br>  haha, but he would just have discovered the same right?<br>  if two flowers (if it has flowers) had different colours, or different reaction time or whatever, but morealess the same conclusion right? its only the features of the plant that he told apart

oIRLs6Spaa	Venus fly traps have evolved to become carnivorous due to the fact that the soil that they grow in is lacking or short on certain key nutrients that are fundamental to plant growth. The media that Venus Fly Traps grow in is nitrogen poor and acidic. Without an ample supply of nitrogen, it is difficult for a plant to synthesize protein, and thus grow. Therefore, in order to supplement their nitrogen supply, Venus fly traps trap and digest insects. Each insect that the a Venus fly trap catches and digests is like a little piece of fertilizer for the plant, giving it a small boost of nutrients to promote growth.<br>  <br>  I have a pretty good writeup on my site here:<br>  <a href="http://www.flytrapcare.com/venus-fly-trap-background-information.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flytrapcare.com/venus-fly-tra...</a><br>  <br>  If you're interested in chatting about flytraps, you should join the forum:<br>  <a href="http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3" rel="nofollow">http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3</a>|`|BQN7j62Faa	Your question lacks details.

z7BiMSWmaa	Darwin made an extremely interesting observation. He discovered that the animals on the Galapagos Islands were not quite like the animals he had seen in South America. In some ways the lizards were the same as those in South America but were different in others. Darwin also observed this to be the same with the many different types of finches on the islands. They were different from the finches he had seen in South America. Darwin then found out something even more important. A tortoise or finch on one island was not quite like a tortoise or a finch on another island. By looking at the shell of a tortoise or the beak of a finch you could tell which island it had come from. All the finches had dull coloured feathers and short tails. They all laid four pink and white eggs in nests with small roofs. The difference was they all had different beaks. On one island they had strong thick beaks for cracking open nuts and seeds. On another island eighty kilometres away they had long thin beaks for catching insects.

Mammals such as the kangaroo rat have very efficient kidneys to cope with this problem: the nephrons contain long loops of henle, to promote high water reabsorption, and dry nasal passages, to reduce water loss. The gemsbok also possesses an interesting adaptation: there are many blood vessels close to the surface of the skin in the neck, improving circulation and thus helping the animal keep cool.|`|df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	How about large ears in order to dissapate heat - jackrabbits, gerboas, bat eared foxes have this adaptation.

The Central Rockies Wolf Project started in 1987, with Parks Canada as a partner. This research uses radio telemetry and snow tracking techniques to find out how wolves use their mountain habitat and how human activities affect them. The Central Rockies Wolf Project works closely with governments, communities and landowners to help resolve conflicts in land use that affect wolves. The ultimate goal is to maintain a self-sustaining population of wolves in the Central Rockies.<br>  <br>  Researchers track the wolves using radio telemetry. Study animals are fitted with a radio collar equipped with a transmitter that emits a unique radio frequency. A directional antennae and a receiver are used to locate the signal. Researchers sometimes conduct telemetry from the air using an airplane or a helicopter. This can be more economical than ground searching for wide-ranging animals.<br>  <br>  In the winter, researchers follow the tracks of wolves and their prey and by looking for other evidence in the snow, can piece together events of the hunt. To avoid disturbing the wolves, the researcher follow the tracks backwards, away from the direction the wolves are traveling. Once a kill site is located, samples are taken from the prey to determine species, age and physical condition. Wolf scat is also analysed to determine food habits.<br>  <br>  This research is providing data about wolf movements, habitat and prey preferences, mortality and location of critical areas such as dens.

(Hawking)  One main discussion point around this amazing phenomenon is time travel.<br>  <br>  In theory, one would travel so quickly through a wormhole, that one would be moving faster than the speed of light.  Professor Hawking puts it this way: “if you can travel from one side of the galaxy, to the other, in a week or two, you could go back through another wormhole, and arrive back before you set out.”(Hawking)"|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	To our current knowledge and certainly our ability, nothing can go faster than the speed of light. There may be subatomic particles that can theoretically do so, but that has not been confirmed.

Originally, the vast majority of peppered moths had light coloration, which effectively camouflaged them against the light-colored trees and lichens upon which they rested. However, due to widespread pollution during the Industrial Revolution in England, many of the lichens died out, and the trees which peppered moths rested on became blackened by soot, causing most of the light-colored moths, or typica, to die off due to predation. At the same time, the dark-colored, or melanic, moths, carbonaria, flourished because of their ability to hide on the darkened trees.|`|kO7xsy6xaa	Only the moths know, who cares.

For example, if your BAC was 3 times the legal definition (.08%) which would be extremely fall-down drunk (.24%), for most people, it would take 12-24 hours for the body (liver primarily) to eliminate all the alcohol.  There is a range because I have considered a wide range of alcohol elimination rates.  Unlike some other drugs, whose metabolites can be detected long after the parent drug is gone, most metabolites of alcohol, such as acetaldehyde, which can also be measured, are metabolized even faster than alcohol.  Keep in mind it depends on the test, but if it a test specifically for ethyl alcohol, 12-24 hours and that would be based on being really intoxicated earlier.|`|EN32vSsCaa	Ethanol can be detected in urine for approx. 24 hours from last ingestion.|`|1b1a662332fbd9982deeb820ccb84317aa	There are ETG/ETS test that will test 80 hours after consumption.

VPhYOWxwaa	Theoretically - yes, and actually no conversion is necessary because matter and energy are equivalent.<br>  Practically - no, we lack the technology to efficiently convert matter into usable energy.<br>  <br>  However we can use pretty much any matter to create usable energy - just very inefficiently. Like you could take any mass drop it on a piston that drives a shaft and you are using that matter to create usable mechanical energy. But I don't think that that is really what you are getting at.<br>  <br>  Thinking about it, it seems that when we are able to harness antimatter that completely efficiently annihilates with matter and converts it all to energy. If we can advance out technology to harness that process, we will be in a whole new ballgame. Imagine being able to use our waste and garbage and maybe even those spent radioactive uranium rods that nuclear power plants end up with that we have yet to figure out how to deal with. Seems too good to be true, and it may well be far far in the future, but I hope not.

My theory is that our souls are all collectively "God" and he is just hanging around seeing how his experiment works out.

XuVwWIMeaa	Water expands when it freezes due to molecular geometry and the fact that it is a very polar molecule. The water molecule is shaped like an upside-down "v". Due to this shape, when water freezes it make a hexagonal shape such that the slightly negatively charge oxygen atoms are aligned with the slightly positively charge hydrogen atoms -- this is the most stable configuration. (Less polar molecules do not configure themselves in this way because there is less of a reduction in energy if the molecule is not as polar) This orientation leaves space in the middle of the frozen water molecules.

MYMNKz4laa	These terms are often used in in vitro culture. Suspension cells float in the media in a petrie dish whereas adherent cells need to stick down to the bottom of the dish in order to be happy. Their preference for one or the other usually comes from their biological function. For example, a type of adherent cell would be skin cells. These cells need to bind to one another as well as other other molecules in their surroundings in order to make up the whole skin and make sure that they do not move. In contrast, cells such as white blood cells are always moving through the blood and do not form networks. They are functional as single cells. <br>  Cell lines may not always follow the logic though. They are have been mutated and altered so much that they have their own unique properties.

One of its functions is similar to the larynx and nasal cavity, by way of protection from dust and other particles. The dust will adhere to the sticky mucous and the cilia helps propel it back up the trachea, to where it is either swallowed or coughed up. The mucociliary escalator extends from the top of the trachea all the way down to the bronchioles, which we will discuss later. Through the trachea, the air is now able to pass into the bronchi

If the universe is truly infinite, it is impossible for us to be alone. Although the conditions for life on a planet are very specific, there has to be somewhere other life. In fact, using simple logic, there must be an infinite number of planets with life on them, unless there is a point in the universe where there is nothing but darkness, which could be the case.<br>  Also, it is impossible for two given universes (within a tetraspace) to be exactly parallel, and there must be portals somewhere in our universe (again, an infinite number of these portals because tetraspace is also infinite). So, aliens from other universes - with completely different laws - could be in our universe after coming through these portals. (one theory is that black holes are these portals, but I think that the portal would be a constantly moving, infinitely stretching plane.<br>  Also, if aliens did come here, which is highly unlikely due to the vast distance of Earth and any other life-sustaining planet, they would probably just be searching for life on other planets like we want to, not invade us.

They can survive in conditions that would kill a human 10 times over.<br>  <br>  2. Like I said the, universe is big, and the conditions for life to form are comparatively rare, so even if other life did form somewhere, they would most likely form a LONG way away from here. They would probably appear in another galaxy entirely.<br>  <br>  And, despite what you see in sci-fi movies, there is no way to travel faster than light. So if life did form such a long way away, it would be very unlikely that we'd ever see it (we certailny wouldn't meet any aliens for a very long time).<br>  <br>  So, yes, there are probably aliens out there, but they probably will not visit the Earth for a long time, if ever.<br>  <br>  And who know's what they'll be like. They might be like us, but probably not. But yes, they would definitely see us as "aliens" (whether or not that means they think we're evil, world-destroying monsters or not, we can't say).

The static charges remains on an object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge. Although charge exchange can happen whenever any two surfaces come into contact and separate, a static charge will only remain when at least one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow (an electrical insulator).|`|N0UUmjDlaa	Static charges are very high potentials, and may gather on many different types of surfaces that are insulated.<br>  The general cause is friction, that allows one surface to "give up" electrons to another.

ha5XzunHaa	If it took 55.48 mL for complete titration, then after 31.64 mL, we are 57% of the way done. This means that the mole fractions are 0.57 conjugate base, 0.43 conjugate acid. The pH is 4.96. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbach equation to find the pKa:<br>  <br>  pH = pKa + log(base/acid)<br>  4.96 = pKa + log(1.33)<br>  <br>  This is the easy way to solve the problem. It requires you to recognize that titrating a weak acid generates a mixture of weak acid and conjugate base, which is a buffer solution! The pH of a buffer does not depend on the concentration, just on the ratio of the conjugate pair.|`|SWTPNiPOaa	webassign? i have the same question on my webassign? do you go to brookwood high in ga?|`|8dffbce3266bc6eb44bbe27559482b26aa	Actually, the question is pretty smart, but you shouldn't spend so much time with it.  You really have to know your base concepts to solve this guy.  Ask your teacher how to do it.  <br>  <br>  Since we don't know the NaOH molarity, call it Bm.  We dont know the weak acid molarity either, so call it Am.  To "completely titrate" a weak acid, all of the acid is converted to the sodium salt of the acid's cation.  The reaction is  NaOH + HA -> Na+A- + H2O.  From the stoichiometry of this reaction, <br>   55.48 x Bm =  25 x Am.  So we can express Bm in terms of Am.<br>  Bm= 0.451 Am<br>  <br>  But prior to that point, we had reacted 31.64 millimoles of NaOH with the 25 mL acid solution and reached a pH of 4.96.   This is mas importante.  The H-H eqtn is <br>   [cation][H+]/[unreacted acid] = Ka.<br>  At this point, of the initial millimoles of acid, we have reacted with<br>  31.64/55.48 = 0.57 (57%) of it.  The rest remains as acid.  We started with 25xAm millimoles.  The [H+] is 10^-5.04= 6.9x10-6 M.   <br>  <br>   Since, at this point, there are 56.64 mL of solution (the NaOH added and initial acid).  We can solve for Ka.   The cation is <br>  [ 0.57x 25 x Am/56.64].  The unreacted acid is [0.43x25xAm/56.64].<br>  You know the [H+].  Toss it into the eqtn and everything will cancel out except the fractions.  So the answer is (0.57/0.43)[H+]=9.2x10^-6|`|kGUpSkhEaa	There is no way, you need a concentration for sodium hydroxide solution. You can guess it's 1M, but it's only a supposition.

HyUE9ON0aa	They are bred for entertainment. If nature knew what was good for it then it shouls have made 50% of humans strile too.|`|SvmZlLdaaa	I'm not sure exactly what you mean by 'a sin against nature'. Certainly respectable zoos frown on the breeding of hybrids such as ligers and tigons, as they have no value from a conservation point of view and are taking up space and resources that could be used to breed endangered species. They are basically freaks bred by unscrupulous zoos in order to make money out of people willing to pay to see them. Today, there is very little chance of them occurring in the wild - tigers are found only in Asia, lions in Africa and the Gir Forest of India, where there are no tigers. Historically, the Asiatic subspecies of lion had a much greater range which overlapped with that of the tiger, so it is possible, though unlikely, that they may once have sometimes occurred in the wild.<br>  <br>  Whilst ligers and tigons are usually sterile, like most hybrids, occasionally a female will be fertile and can be bred back to a male lion or tiger, producing:<br>  <br>  Lion + liger = li-liger<br>  Lion + tigon = li-tigon<br>  Tiger + liger = ti-liger<br>  Tiger + tigon = ti-tigon<br>  <br>  Kamikaze Watermelon - interspecies breeding is NOT impossible. If two species are closely related enough, they can interbreed. Ligers and tigons are proof of that. Or do you think lions and tigers are the same species?|`|D0i0RDmraa	Well your professor meant that it's against the Laws of Nature.It's not natural.Actually when you think about it,it's quite cruel.Imagine being a cross-breed of some different species and that your just like a experiment or something.Either way the merits of twiddling the genetics and stuff is that we might find out new medicine and stuff but the demerits is the cruelty...Though seriously...their genetic structure is like nothing of ours...I wonder why their doing it.For greedy Zoos perhaps?|`|mPfDlG2Laa	My God!

Originally native to temperate South America, it has since been introduced to North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, primarily by fur ranchers.[2] Although it is still valued for its fur in some regions, its destructive feeding and burrowing behaviors make this invasive species a pest throughout most of its range.<br>  <br>  <br>  Wikipedia......you didn't look hard.
1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Intelligent Design CAN be.<br>  <br>  Scientific hypotheses not only describe phenomenon but also make predictions and can be falsified.  Even if you cannot immediately perform a test, it is possible to disprove them.<br>  <br>  As such, intelligent design does make claims.  It suggests that certain things cannot arise naturally and without guidance from an intelligence.  It suggests the some complexity cannot be reduced to adaptively favourable components.  Some versions suggest that species barriers cannot be crossed.<br>  <br>  These are all things that might be disproven, given enough time and the right circumstances.  And I would even say that it is worthwhile to do so if we can.  To dismiss an idea out of hand is rather closed-minded and un-scientific, neh?  And who knows what the benefits of such research might be - knowing exactly how and where complexity can arise might help us find alien life or even predict chaotic systems like the weather.  Useful stuff.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, some of the positive claims made by some versions of Intelligent Design do seem unscientific.  Even we someday agree that AN intelligence must have been involved in the creation of life on our planet, it would seem that we would know nothing more than that.  Aliens would seem to be as good a candidate as a transcendant divinity.  And though some boosters of ID are careful to go no further than the assertion of some intelligence somewhere, most do not seem to be so conservative.<br>  <br>  Current study actually has been painting ID further and further into a corner.  Most of the systems originally proposed as 'irreducible' have been worked out.  Many of the links that were missing have been found.

2lQ8DJAcaa	B. CALVIN-BENSON CYCLE:  CARBON FIXATION<br>  <br>  The ATP and NADPH made during the light reactions have lots of energy and reducing power that can be used for various reactions around in the cells.  However, their chemical energy cannot be easily stored. Therefore, photosynthesizers use the ATP and the reducing power of the NADPH to produce glucose, which can be produced in large quantities and stored for later use. The process of producing glucose from CO2is called carbon (or CO2) fixation.<br>  <br>  The Calvin-Benson Cycle is a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that use the newly generated ATP and NADPH from the light reactions to drive the formation of glucose from CO2 and H2O. These reactions are independent of the presence of light. They can happen in the dark, but they don’t need it to be dark in order for them to occur. They occur in the stroma of the chloroplast.<br>  <br>  There are three phases to the Calvin-Benson cycle:<br>  <br>  1. CO2 uptake: a carbon atom from atmospheric CO2 is added to a 5C sugar:  ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) with the use of an enzyme called rubisco to produce two 3C molecules – PGA (phosphoglycerate). Because the carbon from CO2 is now part of a carbon skeleton, we say that the carbon has been ‘fixed’.<br>  <br>  2. Carbon reduction: ATP and NADPH are used to convert the PGA molecules to glyceraledhyde-3-phosphate (G3P)<br>  <br>  3. RuBP regeneration: For this to be a cycle, we have to get back the RuBP. 6 molecules of CO2 have to come in, they are added to 6 molecules of RuBP (that is another 30 C) for a total of 36 C. Six of those carbons (the exact 6 that were the CO2) get made into glucose and the other 30 get made into 6 molecules of RuBP.

Cu cannot dissolve in either acid.<br>  Mg and Zn will not dissolve instantly in 6M CH3COOH (weak acid), but will take some time.  Yes, they will dissolve pretty fast in 6M HCl (strong acid).<br>  Weak acids react slower than strong acids because they contain dramatically fewer H+ ions per litre.|`|sD7zLRzdaa	HCl is a STRONG acid, that is to say it is 100% dissociated into ions.  A solution of 6M concentration will give 6M H+ ions (and 6M chloride ions too)<br>  ethanioc acid is a WEAK acid, regardless of its concentration.  A weak acid is less than 100% dissociated into ions.  so the equilibrium solution will contain undissociated CH3COOH, and somewhat less than 6M each of CH3COO- and H+ ions.<br>  <br>  The similar behaviour is probably because both are CONCENTRATED acids (6moles per liter).  If you reduced the concentration by half, then you would see a difference in the rate of each reaction.|`|AA10977576	Well, the very first thing you should know or recognize is that HCl is a much stronger acid than acetic.  HCl will completely ionize, nearly 100%, while acetic acid, not as much. The observations depend on what you saw with each reaction, like color change, fizzing, etc. It's just whatever you saw that was different between the reactions.
mHnd1FJTaa	(a) This is a basic opening of an epoxide: the nucleophile will attack the least substituted carbon of the epoxide, and the product will be 1-methoxy-2-methylpropan-2-ol (aka the OMe is on the leftmost carbon, and OH and two methyl groups come off the second carbon). <br>  <br>  (b) This is acid-catalyzed, and it will have the opposite regiochemistry - the nucleophile will attack the more substituted position.  This is because in the first step, the O of the epoxide is protonated, and so when it starts leaving as the nucleophile approaches, the bond lengthens and leaves a partial positive charge on the carbon that can best handle a positive charge = the more substituted one.  This is  SN1- like. The product will be 2-methoxy-2-methylpropan-1-ol

The Earth is also revolving around the Sun, so each day of the year, the Earth is at a different point in its orbit.

bCktqpr5aa	E=mc^2 is a very important equation for physics because it links two things which if you used common sense seem very separate- mass and energy. <br>  <br>  E= energy, m=mass and c=speed of light in a vacuum (3x10^8 m/s).<br>  <br>  One example for the use of this equation is in calculations involving the binding energy of an atom- that's the energy needed to hold the nucleus together and counter the forces which try to push it apart particularly the electromagnetic force. If you add up the masses of all the protons and neutrons that should be in a specific atom's nucleus and subtract the mass of the atom's nucleus once it's formed there is a difference. During fission (splitting up on an atom) this energy is released and you get nulcear power! Einstein's equation allows you to calculate it.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in this sort of thing you might want to look at special relativity too, it adds to E=mc^2 and also proves why it is impossible to travel at the speed of light.|`|tzkwu2tdaa	This formula is the relationship that matter and energy have when converted to one another.  <br>  <br>  E= total energy (J)<br>  M= total mass (kg)<br>  c= speed of light in a vacuum (m/s)<br>  <br>  Obviously, the speed of light is a very large number and so the conversion of a small amount of matter yields a  large amount of energy.|`|tQlrL3Evaa	energy = (mass) (calories)^2|`|dYqC3s10aa	Here this will explain it<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%3DMC2" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%3DMC2</a><br>  or<br>  In physics, mass–energy equivalence is the concept that any mass has an associated energy, and that any energy has an associated type of mass.

2lQ8DJAcaa	On the Earth, the lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost layer of the mantle (the upper mantle or lower lithosphere) which is joined to the crust. The plates that fit like puzzle pieces around the Earth are made of Earth’s crust and the upper part of the mantle layer. Together the crust and upper mantle are called the lithosphere and they extend about 80 km deep. <br>  <br>  The asthenosphere is solid even though it is at very hot temperatures of about 1600 C due to the high pressures from above. However, at this temperature, minerals are almost ready to melt and they become ductile and can be pushed and deformed like silly putty in response to the warmth of the Earth. These rocks actually flow, moving in response to the stresses placed upon them by the churning motions of the deep interior of the Earth. The flowing asthenosphere carries the lithosphere of the Earth, including the continents, on its back.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	The lithosphere is the crust of a planet.

4RJKl1aKaa	Yes.  I bought one a couple of years ago.  It's a good deal for the price I paid for it, but the price seems to have gone up since then.  I paid about ￡165 for mine but now the cheapest it is available is around the ￡230 mark - shop around for it.<br>  <br>  The tripod is fairly sturdy.  I'm not sure _what_ it is: it looks like steel but is non-magnetic.  The spreader bars are only plastic but the tripod seems rigid enough anyway.<br>  <br>  The mount fits on a north locating pin on the tripod and has fine azimuth adjustment knobs.  There is no polar alignment scope, although some provision for one appears to have been made and I think you could retro-fit one if so desired.  It is generally of solid construction and suitably rigid when properly adjusted - make sure the latitude adjustment is firmly tightened.<br>  <br>  The setting circles aren't great - they never are on scope at this level - but will get you to at least the right general area of sky.  Declination is marked in rather awkward 3.1/3 degree graduations and RA 10 minutes.  My biggest complaint about them is the indicator arrows that are only embossed in the mount's casting and not coloured in any way, making them impossible to see in the dark.  I carefully highlighted the arrows with tippex to cure that.<br>  <br>  Overall the mount is usable.  Yes, gusts of wind will catch it but that goes for any scope - Dobs included.  Vibrations are quickly damped which is the important thing.<br>  <br>  Regarding the actual scope, the primary has a centre ring already marked for collimation purposes, but on my example I found the ring was over 1/8" from the centre of the mirror.  In my experience the scope is absolute pants at holding collimation.  I find even the secondary needs adjustment most times I use it.<br>  <br>  The focuser is a naff rack and pinion type and does noticeably rock up and down as you focus in and out.  Having said this its is perfectly usable, just not refined.  It will take 2" eyepieces but only directly into the drawtube - you don't get an actual eyepiece holder and it lacks any sort of thumbscrew to lock the larger EP in place.  If you have some 2" eyepieces to hand try them, but  it isn't worth buying them specially.<br>  <br>  Probably the weakest link in the whole package though is the finder scope, or rather the finder bracket.  As supplied it simply doesn't grip the tube at all meaning the slightest touch knocks it out of alignment.  I've greatly improved the situation by slightly enlarging the bracket mounting holes to properly accommodate the securing nuts, and also put some foam rubber between the bracket and the tube to increase the friction between the two.  This has greatly improved things but it's still not perfect.  Unlike some of the other scopes in the same range, the viewfinder lacks an illuminated<br>  recticle.  Still, the finder is easily replaced if you find it unusable<br>  <br>  In summary, at the price I paid for it, it is a bargain.  I'm not sure how much of a bargain it is at the higher price.  It's certainly a solid and capable scope with fairly good optical quality - the longish focal ratio helps there.  As a sub ￡200 scope it was unbeatable but now it is up against 6" GEMs.  <br>  <br>  The scope is basically good quality and the mount - things that it may be worth sacrificing a little aperture for.  Aperture is _not_ king for all the Dob lovers say.  I see a few have already tried to persuade you of the benefits of a Dob but I say ignore them.  If you want a GEM then a GEM is what you should get.  With a Dob you sacrifice a lot in order to gain cheap aperture and they are certainly not all things to all people.  I still use this scope quite a bit as a general knockaround scope.  It is basic and lacks refinement but it is basically a competent scope.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	My first question would be whether you really need an equatorial mount. These are usually sold with promises of astrophotography, but in reality you'd have to pay at least twice what this scope costs to get an adequate equatorial mount. I'd recommend instead a Dobsonian reflector, where more of the money is going into the optics. For example the SkyWatcher Skyliner 200P offers nearly twice the aperture and is still within your budget:<br>  <a href="http://www.opticalvision.co.uk/astronomical_telescopes/sky-watcher/dobsonians" rel="nofollow">http://www.opticalvision.co.uk/astronomi...</a><br>  <br>  Here are a few web pages with good information on beginner's telescopes:<br>  <a href="http://www.gaherty.ca/tme/TME0702_Buying_a_Telescope.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaherty.ca/tme/TME0702_Buying...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.scopereviews.com/begin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scopereviews.com/begin.html</a><br>  <a href="http://observers.org/beginner/j.r.f.beginner.html" rel="nofollow">http://observers.org/beginner/j.r.f.begi...</a><br>  <br>  For more advanced information, read Phil Harrington's Star Ware, 4th edition (Wiley).<br>  <br>  You'll get the greatest value for your money with a Newtonian reflector on a Dobsonian mount, such as these:<br>  <a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/category/~category_id=dobsonians/~pcategory=telescopes/~VIEW_INDEX=0/~VIEW_SIZE=1000000" rel="nofollow">http://www.telescope.com/control/categor...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.skywatchertelescope.net/swtinc/product.php?class1=1&class2=106" rel="nofollow">http://www.skywatchertelescope.net/swtin...</a><br>  <br>  Buy from a store which specializes in telescopes and astronomy, either locally or online; don't buy from department stores, discount stores or eBay as mostly what they sell is junk.

Astrophotography is by far the most expensive and difficult area of amateur astronomy.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	Fiona,<br>  <br>  IMHO a better by for the money is the 8" Meade Light Bridge.  It's only 79 pounds over your budget but an excellent buy (see the first link below).  I have a friend who has one and he loves it.<br>  <br>  A 13cm (5 inch in the states) is right at the bottom end of what you need to see all of the Messier objects (a list containing Galaxies, Nebula, Supernova Remnants, Open Clusters, and Globular Clusters recorded by Charles Messier).  The 8" scope would find all of those objects easily plus get you started on the Herschel list as well.  <br>  <br>  What you loose by not getting the equatorial mount is the the tracking once you find the object.  This, to me, is a small price to pay for having roughly 68% more light gathering capability.  Simply put the more light you can gather the more you can see.  Magnification will have relatively little effect in allowing you to see more.  Additionally, an equatorial mount will take more learning to get it working correctly. Whereas, the dobsonian mount you'll be able to setup in a mater of minutes.<br>  <br>  You need to consider a few other items but you don't have to buy the right away.<br>  <br>  1) A red light flash light (you can buy an LED version at almost any hardware store.<br>  2) A lunar filter. Get the kind with a double polarized ring.<br>  3) Warm coveralls, Shoes, gloves, and a hat for observing.  <br>  4) A decent set of star charts. I recommend the latest version of Uranometria 2000.0 (see the second link).  If you can find it with laminated pages that would be great because the might does get dewy at times.<br>  5) Most important a laser collimator or set of collimating eyepeices.  You'll need them to keep your scope in proper alignment.<br>  <br>  Good luck and let us know what you got.

AA11606721	evenstar7878 is correct. I would only add that the evolution of *some* groups of organisms proceeds through gradualism.

In fact, evolutionary theory has identified *many* ways of speciation.|`|17y42pNraa	Gradualism states that evolution is a continuous process that occurs extremely slowly, whereas punctuated equilibrium states that evolution occurs rapidly, but in short bursts of time.

This helps in restoring normal blood pressure. Plasma is the part of the blood that is used to transport glucose, hormones, amino acids, minerals, etc. <br>  <br>  However, "blood" is made up of mainly red blood cells and white blood cells. Red blood cells take about 1 week to generate from specialized stem cells, so your red blood cell count should be restored within a week. Red blood cells are used to transport oxygen to tissues, and to a smaller extent, CO2. I believe most of the CO2 is transported via the plasma in another form (sodium bicarbonate). Red blood cells normally last around 120 days, as stated above, and when they get too "old" they are "eaten" by certain white blood cells in the spleen. <br>  <br>  The white blood cells are part of the immune system.

iUM1h6Yjaa	LOL, you're hear plenty of hysterical hyperventilation about how the Ouija board is a portal to hell and did this bad thing or that... someone used the Ouija board and the next week something bad happened to them. Why? Well, the Ouija board of course!  You can find lots of crapola on the internet, including lots of stories about Ouija boards.<br>  <br>  As you'll probably see if you re-read those stories from a skeptical point of view (that is, needing evidence), it's a lot of power of suggestion and fear and nothing else. Ouija boards don't conjure spirits or demons but only superstitions. And if you have a few superstitious friends to play it with, it can conjure some hilarious times watching gullible people freak themselves out :)<br>  <br>  So feel free to pull out the board again, and find some friends to play it with. If you really want to know how the board "works", read the link below. And if you want to convince yourselves of this, blindfold all the participants and try the board again. You'll get nonsense, and that's because it is the participants choosing where the planchette goes, not any ghost :) <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|AA10631668	Unless you are scared by superstitious nonsense.

I have used the board since 1964 and never, ever had anything bad to happen. Those who claim to have had bad experiences believed they would and thus their mind produced something to convince them that they had been in contact with demons. Demons do not exist. I am not a skeptic per say and consider myself a true believer, but I do not fall for every tall tale you hear either. One thing I can say is that before the movie the Exorcist, the Ouija board was not given a bad rap by everyone. Just a few religious radicals claimed it was evil then the movie and presto it was all of a sudden evil and a portal to hell.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, yes they are safe to use. You will not open a protal to hell and you will not be possessed by demons. Doesn't the fact that they are sold in toy stores tell you that?

ow3LGXEqaa	A simple model of conduction can be thought of kind of like a Newton's cradle. You have lots of little solid balls all in a line. When you heat the line up at one end, what you're really doing is giving one of the balls a little kinetic (moving) energy.<br>  <br>  When that particle bangs into its neighbour, it'll impart some of its energy to that ball, which will then also start to vibrate. If you keep a constant heat going so that energy leaves the first ball at the same rate as you're putting it in, the energy will travel along the line of particles until it reaches the end. This model only really works well for solid objects.<br>  <br>  Conduction is a rather different method of heat transport, but it relies on the same principle. Think of the line of balls again, but this time they are ina a fluid, so the bonds between particles are weaker. Imagine that they are joined together by rubber bands rather than hitting into each other. The more they vibrate, the further the bands stretch, so the particles are further apart from each other. In other words, the substance is less dense.<br>  <br>  If you think about a beaker of water being heated from underneath, the water at the bottom of the beaker will get less dense than the water at the top. As a result, it will rise through the bulk of the liquid until it gets to the top and cools down. By this point, however, the cold fluid from the top has sunk to the bottom and is being heated up itself!<br>  <br>  This gives rise to "convection currents", vertical loops caused by a continual rising and falling of fluids at different temperatures.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped a bit, and don't worry, I'm sure you're smarter than you think you are!

For the first 7 years of my career I did travel around the U.S. (16 states) and 2 countries to study animals (mainly birds).  I finally settled down to permanent full time work studying endangered species.  You should go for a degree in zoology, biology, wildlife management, or something along those lines. You will need a minimum of a Bachelors of Science degree PLUS experience.  Try and do internships and volunteer work while still in school.  Once out of school you can qualify for seasonal positions that will allow you to travel.  Keep in mind, this field of work does not pay much.  Typically the higher your degree and the more experience you have the higher your salary will be.  It also depends who you work for.

NSQaDOhYaa	These things are relatively straightforward once you get the hang of them, so it's a good thing that you're getting some practice. To solve them you need two pieces of information<br>  <br>  (a) the balanced equation for the reaction, so you know how many moles of each reagent are required in the ideal case<br>  <br>  (b) the number of moles of each reagent actually taking part in the reaction, so you can see which one is in excess.<br>  <br>  Let's work through the two problems:<br>  <br>  1) This one's fairly easy; the balanced reaction is<br>  <br>  NaOH + HCl --> NaCl + H2O<br>  <br>  so you need 1 mole of NaOH for each mole of HCl. To convert the weights of each reagent into the number of moles, you need to divide by the molar mass for that reagent. You can work out the molar mass from the relative atomic masses of its constituents, allowing for the number of atoms of each present, or you can do it the easy way - look it up in the entry for that reagent in Wikipedia. (Or both, of course, to check your calculations.)<br>  <br>  So, number of moles of HCl = 7.81/36.46 = 0.214<br>  number of moles of NaOH = 5.24/40.00 = 0.131<br>  <br>  and the HCl is in excess, and the NaOH the limiting reagent.<br>  <br>  2) The second is a bit more complicated; the balanced reaction is<br>  <br>  5 SF4 + 2 I2O5 --> 4 IF5 + 5 SO2<br>  <br>  Remember, the guiding principle is to get the same number of atoms of each element on either side of the equation. In this case we need 5 moles of SF4 for every two of I2O5.<br>  <br>  Number of moles of SF4 = 4.687/108.07 = 0.0434<br>  Number of moles of I2O5 = 6.281/333.81 = 0.0188<br>  <br>  It's not immediately obvious which is in excess, so divide the first figure by the second to get the ratio of SF4 to I2O5 = 2.31. So there's not quite enough SF4 to provide the ideal ratio of 2.5, and that is therefore the limiting reagent.
7orzm3kNaa	If it weren't for crossover in meiosis, genetic diversity would cease to exist. Crossing over allows for genetic recombination to occur. During meiosis, when chromosomes pair up during synapsis, portions of the homologous pairs of chromosomes have the ability to "break"<br>  off. This breakage allows for genes to be exchanged between chromosomes, resulting in NEW (key word) combination of genes. <br>  <br>  The resulting daughter cells will now have different sets of genes than either of the parental chromosomes resulting in genetic diversity. The key thing to consider is that this is occurring with billions of cells, which results in massive variation between cells and infinite possibilities of genetic combinations in the gametes, which later on, will go through the same process, resulting in even MORE combinations!|`|17y42pNraa	It is a source of genetic variation.

kGUpSkhEaa	Yes, it does, and it's the reason.<br>  Propene has a double bond: a sigma bond and a pi bond. The pi bond means a high electron density outside the internuclear axis (of the two double-bonded carbon atoms). So it will interact with another electron cloud to make it positive.<br>  Now consideer a pi bond interacting with a bromine molecule. The pi bond will polarize the bromine molecule, making the bromine atom closer to the pi bond more positive, and the bromine atom further, more negative, finally releasing it as a very stable bromide anion.<br>  Then, as the propene-brominium cation is positive, it will interact with bromide ions, leading to a dibromide, or with the more abundant water molecules, leading to a bromhidrine.|`|luYtFLSUaa	The double bond is the key.

9fdb8309a82d0fd5cf22e900d46f7662aa	If you have walked through a greenhouse, you know that it is warmer inside than out. This is because the sunlight comes through the glass, turns to heat and can not get out. A similar thing happens as CO2 builds up in the atmosphere, sunlight comes in, changes to heat and can not get back out through the CO2. We notice on a clear night that it gets colder as the heat radiates out into space. On a cloudy night the heat is reflected back toward the earth and it stays warmer. The CO2 acts like the cloud layer. This is greenhouse effect. Global warming is because the trapped heat adds to the normal heat coming in from the sun.
oaeD5B1taa	It's a little complex...carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere readily passes ultraviolet radiation which, like all electromagnetic radiation, has heating effects on plant and animal life...but it also very readily absorbs infrared rays. The planet is warmed by radiation from the sun to a greater or lesser degree from the entire electromagnetic spectrum. But any physical object that absorbs heat from radiation immediately begins reradiating it back outwards until an equilibrium point is reached at which it is emitting rays as fast as it is receiving and absorbing them...this is known classically as black body radiation and lead to the single greatest and most ingenious scientific theory of all time----the Quantum Hypothesis.<br>  <br>  In any event, since the ozone layer in the upper ionosphere is badly depleted by high altitude atomic tests and the HAARP program, ultraviolet radiation is not being blocked the way it once was while in the meantime, then increased carbon dioxide is absorbing more and more infrared radiation and trapping it within the atmosphere so that when the earth release heat radiation in the form of i.r , it stays trapped and gets reradiated by the CO2 back down on the earth's crust instead of passing out into space. <br>  <br>  In a glass enclosed green house, the glass acts essentially the same way except that glass is supposed to block UV even though more or less easily pass i.r. some of which it absorbs and reradiates and some of which it simply transmits straight through. The main function of a green house is to trap heat within and to minimalize its being radiated out into the surrounding air.<br>  <br>  Back in 1922, the Russian physicist, Glagiola Arkedeivich succeeded in producing radio waves of such short wavelengths (fractions of a millimeter) that they were actually into the infrared....but very little was done with this discovery and much of the work that was being done on solar and other radiation came to a halt because of the Big One.|`|4JxbRzaJaa	fuk u homes|`|jGtR6It4aa	Both let UV light through and both reflect the heat produced by the UV light.|`|JdmwlvSRaa	oh well this is the easiest question ever....................................... don't know<br>  Hope i helped u

AA10929714	The equilibrium solutions to a first-order autonomous differential equation, which is an equation of the form dy/dt = f(y) (i.e., the independent variable, t, does not appear explicitly) are the values of y and t for which dy/dt = 0.  Your equation, <br>  <br>  dy/dt = 2t + y<br>  <br>  is not an autonomous equation because "t" appears explicitly.<br>  <br>  Let's see if we can transform it to an autonomous equation by making a substitution.  Let <br>  <br>  u = 2t + y or y = u - 2t<br>  <br>  then<br>  <br>  dy/dt = du/dt - 2<br>  <br>  Plug this into the original differential equation to obtain:<br>  <br>  du/dt = u + 2<br>  <br>  This is now an autonomous equation, and it's equilibrium solution is given by:<br>  <br>  0 = u + 2<br>  <br>  u = -2<br>  <br>  Now back substitute for u:<br>  <br>  2t + y = -2<br>  <br>  y = -2t - 2<br>  <br>  This is the equilibrium solution for this equation.  You can verify that it is, indeed a solution by differentiating it, plugging it into the original equation, and showing that the equation is satisfied.<br>  <br>  Note that if we took the approach of simply setting dy/dt = 0 in the original equation, and tried to solve for the equilibrium solution that way, we'd get the wrong answer:<br>  <br>  dy/dt = 2t + y = 0<br>  <br>  y = -2t<br>  <br>  dy/dt= -2<br>  <br>  Plug this into the original equation:<br>  <br>  -2 = 2t - 2t WRONG!<br>  <br>  This approach is not correct because the original equation is not autonomous.<br>  -----<br>  <br>  The original differential equation is a linear, first-order equation, and we can use an integrating factor (IF) to solve it:<br>  <br>  IF = exp(INTEGRAL of {-1 dt} = exp(-t)<br>  <br>  y(t) = exp(t) * INTEGRAL of {2t * exp(-t) dt}<br>  <br>  y(t) = exp(t) *[C - 2*t*exp(-t) - 2*exp(-t)]<br>  <br>  y(t) = C*exp(t) - 2t - 2<br>  <br>  where C is the constant of integration.  This is the general solution, which you can verify by taking the derivative, plugging it into the differential equation, and showing that it's satisfied.<br>  ----<br>  <br>  Contrary to what your question states, this solution does *not* asymptotically approach a straight line as t -> infinity.  As t gets large, the solution becomes dominated by the exponential term, so the solution asymptotically approaches C*exp(t) as t gets large.<br>  <br>  If the original equation were:<br>  <br>  dy/dt = 2t - y<br>  <br>  then this equation would have the behavior described in the question.  Did you mistype the equation when you asked the question?
AA10929714	If there were no deposits or withdrawals, the amount of money in the account (N(t) would grow exponentially with time, and would follow the rate law:<br>  <br>  dN/dt = k*N(t)<br>  <br>  where k is the annual interest rate, expressed as a fraction (5%/yr = 0.05/yr)<br>  <br>  In this case, the amount of money in the account is also changing because we are adding or subtracting funds at the time-varying rate given in the question.  This means that the rate of change of the funds in the account follows the equation:<br>  <br>  dN(t)/dt = k*N(t) + a - b*t<br>  <br>  where, in this case, a = $2000/yr, and b = 500$/yr^2, i.e., <br>  <br>  dN(t)/dt = (0.05/yr)*N + $2000/yr - ($500/yr^2)*t<br>  <br>  To make this an initial value problem, we also must specify that N(0) = $10,000.<br>  <br>  This is a nonhomogeneous, linear, first order equation that can be solved using an integrating factor.  For an equation of the form:<br>  <br>  dN/dt + f(t)*N = g(t)<br>  <br>  the integrating factor p(t) is given by:<br>  <br>  p(t) = exp(INTEGRAL of {f(t) dt}<br>  <br>  and the solution to the equation is given by:<br>  <br>  N(t) = (1/p(t))*INTEGRAL of {p(t)*g(t) dt}<br>  <br>  Here, we have that:<br>  <br>  p(t) = exp(INTEGRAL of {-k dt} = exp(-k*t)<br>  <br>  So the solution is:<br>  <br>  N(t) = exp(k*t)*INTEGRAL of {a*exp(-k*t) - b*t*exp(-k*t) dt}<br>  <br>  N(t) = exp(k*t)*[c - exp(-k*t)*(a/k - b*t/k - b/k^2)]<br>  <br>  N(t) = c*exp(k*t) + (b/k^2 - a/k + b*t/k)<br>  <br>  where c is a constant of integration. <br>  <br>  For the values of a, b, and k in this case, we have:<br>  <br>  N(t) = c*exp(t/20yr) + ($160,000 + ($10,000/yr)*t)<br>  <br>  Now use the initial value of N to solve for the constant of integration:<br>  <br>  $10,000 = c + $160,000<br>  <br>  c = -$150,000<br>  <br>  The particular solution for this IVP is then:<br>  <br>  N(t) = ($160,000 + ($10,000/yr)*t) - ($150,000)*exp(t/20yr)<br>  <br>  You can plot this to find when N(t) hits zero.  You should find that this happens at about 13.583 years.

a4kTbjfeaa	Do you mean how can a physician be sure that they understand a patient's wishes?<br>  The best way is for a patient to have his/her wishes written down as a legal document clearly stating there wishes should they become unable to make them due to medical illness. A health care proxy can be done which states the individuals wishes and appoints a proxy to make medical decisions in the event that the person cannot. Patients can sign DNR (do not resuscitate) forms and DNI (do not intubate) forms which go into effect in the event the patient suffers cardiac or respiratory arrest. <br>  When discussing life wishes it should be done with several people so that all the options are discussed and there are witnesses. In the hospital setting usually the main physician caring for the patient along with consulting doctors, social worker and nurses may be involved in the process of discussing the patients wishes.

Pre-med isn't a major, it's just the required courses that anyone would need to get into medical school.  Even though it's still early in your schooling, check out the websites of various medical schools to see what those courses are and what's expected. <br>  <br>  After you get your B.S in your science major, you would then apply to medical school for your M.D or to pharmacy school. You'll be considered on the basis of your undergraduate college grades, so make sure you get a good foundation now in high school. <br>  <br>  After you get your M.D., then you'd specialize in pediatrics, etc.<br>  <br>  With the use of various treatment and diagnostic tools such as nuclear medicine and optics, physics would be important.<br>  <br>  Becoming  a doctor does require math, but you won't really use it that much after you get your MD.

Depending upon the university - this will lead to one of the following qualifications - MBBS; MBBS/BSc; MBChB; MBBCh; BMBS - all of which are normally referred to as a "first MB".<br>  <br>  Individual university medical schools set their own requirements, which vary between medical school and the course applied for. It is therefore essential that applicants consult the undergraduate prospectuses for the medical schools to which they wish to apply and/or contact the medical schools directly to seek clarification.<br>  <br>  Undergraduate courses<br>  The majority of medical schools require A levels in chemistry, whilst others will accept AS level in chemistry, depending upon the other qualifications being offered. Some require biology at A’ level.<br>  <br>  <br>  Candidates without science A Levels<br>  For candidates without science subjects to offer at A level (or equivalent), it is possible to undertake an additional pre-medical year at some universities (see section training to be a doctor). The pre-medical year is a preliminary course in chemistry, physics and biology and lasts normally 30 weeks. <br>  <br>  <br>  Candidates without A’ levels<br>  A small number of access courses are offered which can lead on into a medical degree. The acceptability of access courses varies between medical schools and it is essential to check this prior to embarking on an access course.<br>  <br>  Cadidates without A' levels but with considerable life experience may still need to hold academic qualifications and will need to produce evidence of their ability to cope with the demands of the course for which they are applying.<br>   <br>  <br>  Medical schools welcome applications from students of all ages.<br>  Selection policy varies at the individual medical schools. They will take account of the length of undergraduate course and postgraduate training that doctors are required to undertake. <br>  <br>  <br>  Graduate candidates normally need a first or upper second class honours degree.<br>  Medical schools increasingly welcome applications from graduates. Graduate candidates normally need a first or upper second class honours degree.  Some medical schools require the degree to be in a science-related subject, whilst others do not stipulate any discipline.<br>  <br>  Most medical schools require applications from all applicants to be made through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), which will supply details of how and when to apply for medical school and all other university courses.<br>  <br>  It is estimated that graduates, mostly with science degrees, make up 10-15% of recent intakes to the five and six-year MB courses in Britain. Most come into the first year, but some universities accept students from bio-medical or life sciences or dentistry into the third MBBS year.<br>  <br>  <br>  Age limits<br>  There are no formal set age limits for entry to medical school and selection and admission policies are matters for individual institutions to determine. However, medical schools will take account of the length of training (approximately 10 years) in relation to the length of service the candidate could provide.<br>  <br>  <br>  What medical schools will be looking for in candidates<br>  The standards of entry for any medical teaching centre are exacting. Applicants called for interview will face searching questions about their motivation, their work at school, hobbies and personal interests, as well as having to produce evidence of their academic achievements. A key question will be their reasons for wanting to become a doctor. Candidates should also be able to demonstrate relevant paid or voluntary work experience e.g. work as a hospital auxiliary, in nursing or residential care. You can also find more about what it is like to be a doctor by having a formal period of work observation. BMA members can look at the BMA website for information about guidelines for work observation. The BMA does not hold information on voluntary work or arrange work observation. Students can find the addresses of local hospitals and residential homes in the telephone book. Other potential sources of advice may be available at your local Careers/Connexions Service or library.<br>  <br>  UKCAT - with effect from  the summer of 2006, for entry 2007, including deferred entry for 2008, the UK clinical aptitude test (UKCAT) will be used in the selection process, by a consortium of UK Medical and Dental Schools. For information about UKCAT please click here<br>  <br>  <br>  A note for students with disabilities<br>  The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requires universities and their medical schools to provide disability statements giving information about facilities available for disabled students. These should include details such as access for disabled students, availability of specialist equipment and counselling, admission arrangements, and complaints and appeals procedures for disabled students. The Act|`|GsV67vUNaa	Nope. I took it because I'm a science nerd, but one of my friends who's more arty took the bare minimum. You can get by with just chemistry and biology. Sometimes universities like to look for maths or physics (because they're more analytical) however, I know that the UKCAT test has been brought in to check aptitude.<br>  <br>  Not being a GP. I don't know if physics ever really comes into your day to day life, but judging that it doesn't come into mine then I'm going to go ahead and say that physics would only be a must if you wanted to go into medical physics.<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck!

R9KvEhMxaa	Lorazepam, Oxazepam and Temazepam are the only three benzos I have listed that undergo no Phase I metabolism (to be fair, Temazepam does a little, but an insignificant amount) and are excreted directly via Phase II conjugation reactions. <br>  <br>  You can metabolize lorazepam. If you couldn't, you'd either be dead, or have had a liver transplant (in which case you could again) by the time you were old enough to use the internet. Really. The same mechanism that metabolizes lorazepam is also responsible for removing basically all other metabolic waste, including bilirubin. It's a system totally unaffected by Fluvoxamine. Oxazepam and Temazepam exact via the same path, but do not have quite the same pharmacological profile that Lorazepam does.<br>  <br>  Since these aren't migraine headaches, I don't know why Imitrix would be tried. If they were migraine headaches, benzos wouldn't really do anything either. Perhaps a better muscle relaxant, like Cyclobenzaprine, or Metaxalone. <br>  <br>  Hm. Wait. Someone posted a question like this about a month ago. I think.<br>  <br>  Lorazepam is not affected by Fluvoxamine at all. Fluvoxamine inhibits Cytochrome P450 enzymes. Lorazepam is not, under any circumstances. Lorazepam is directly modified by UGT1A, which is not affected by.. really anything at all.|`|eQCsKq4jaa	Firstly, you are aware that fluvox and tramadol, when mixed, can cause serotonin syndrome but this is very rare.<br>  <br>  If I understand your question you need a medication for headaches? <br>  <br>  <br>  A Tricyclic antidepressant could be taken (Nortriptyline is good for headache). But the Fluvox will elevate the TCA serum level so 10-25mg/day is a safe dose.<br>  <br>  NSAID’s like Toradol and Ketoprofene are good for headaches. But bleeding risk is increased.<br>  <br>  Beta-blockers have increased serum levels and most can cause major cardiac problems. Atenolol should not have this risk.<br>  <br>  I think the benzo’s Clonazepam and Librium might work (different metabolism action). <br>  <br>  Butalbital is a very good headache med. <br>  Floricet is used for headache (Butalbital, Acetaminophen, and Caffeine)<br>  <br>  And there are many types of opioid- Morphine is much different from Hydrocodone and Propoxyphene is different.  <br>  <br>  I would need to know what has been tried and exact type of headache to give better advice. Feel free to ask me more questions.<br>  <br>  Did more looking-<br>  <br>  Trimethobenzamide might provide some pain help and SHOULD work. Haldol will not.<br>  <br>  Metaxalone- which types of muscle relaxes is the patient allergic to?<br>   <br>  Topiramate- I am fairly sure this will be active but is typically for migraine.<br>  <br>  Indometacin (indomethacin) NSAID will work.<br>  <br>  Hydroxyzine (an antihystamine used in conjunction)<br>  <br>  Carbamazepine is an Inducer of CYP2D6.<br>  <br>  Carisoprodol, Phenabarb, and Mephobarbital will NOT work<br>  <br>  If this is really bad Chloral hydrate might be used during the day if a seditive is the best. <br>  <br>  Does Morphine not even work?

9PIyHfzGaa	First, your question needs refining. Quarks have two types of charges: an electric charge and a color charge. The reason for the electric charge is that the quarks couple to a U(1) gauge vector-potential also known as the photon, which endows the quark with an electric charge. The other charge or color stems from the quarks coupling to a SU(3) gauge vector-potential known as a gluon (there are actually 8 of them since 3^2-1=8). The theory encompassing the quarks and their properties is called Yang-Mills theory with associated Lie algebras U(1), SU(2), and S(3) which are called gauge groups.|`|O7rMKLEMaa	Unknown.

Everything else is bull.<br>  <br>  Nostradamus didn't predict anything for 2012.<br>  <br>  Some people think the Mayans did, but they are wrong. The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012." The Mayan calendar contains events that happen AFTER 2012, even after 4000 AD, so clearly the world will not "end" at this point.<br>  <br>  (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)<br>  <br>  The hoaxters mainly choose 12212012 because of numerology (which is also garbage) and the repeating and reversal of "12", and also because December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY ancient civilizations. And that's ALL.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

You can focus on wildlife and gain hands on experience working with wild animals through volunteer work, internships etc.  Once you have at least a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology, biology, wildlife biology or similar, you can qualify for seasonal work studying all sorts of animals.  If you want to get into education, then you might want to get your credentials as well to be able to teach classes relating to wildlife.|`|4c1e07d9ba0c2d099d9db46ee34af35faa	You can work as a zoologist in the field studying animals. However, interaction is usually something that has to be avoided - you want to see animals carrying out their natural behaviour, not strange behaviour that they have adopted because there are people around. Also, wild animals tend to be frightened of people and usually run away. These days if we need to sample them for the purposes of genetic or hormone analysis we opt for non-invasive sampling such as faeces wherever possible. The idea that you go round darting or trapping everything is a bit outdated.<br>  <br>  To get into this area, especially if you have designs on working with large mammals or birds you will have to study for a further degree such as PhD and join an established field project, or have a very good idea of your own, so someone will take you on. These places are very competitive, so you need to have a very good first degree.<br>  <br>  During your studies, there may be chances to join an expedition and that is one way of developing some field skills and experience and there will be field trips included as part of your degree to see whether you like it or not.<br>  <br>  If you prefer to opt for the media route again you will need a good degree and some extras on your CV as this is also competitive.<br>  <br>  I did my first degree at Edinburgh and loved it.|`|bOrDLbXgaa	I am a final year Zoologist at the University of Manchester (I recommend it!).<br>  <br>  Most of the people on my course seem to want to either go into academics (working in labs etc) or conservation.

To get into presenting would require the same level of commitment and determination.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, their are plenty of other ways to interact with animals, such as work in zoos, parks and museums.

f5mxKjqVaa	I think the best way to approach this situation is to get out your best ballroom dress, and wear that to your neighbors house. Greet them with a friendly hug, and get a good wiff of them. If they smell good, definately invite them to pop the bubble together.<br>  Here's the trick, if they compliment you on the dress, they should be allowed to keep the amazing treasures inside of the bubble. If not, you should divide it evenly.<br>  <br>  Of course if they smell bad, you should pop the bubble yourself, keep everything, then go home, put on Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure with the volume turned down, eat a tub of orange sherbet, then cuddle up with the iguana and spank the monkey until you fall asleep.<br>  <br>  The lemons and the eel will take things from there.

This is good because it allows fish, to have access to oxygen (i.e. oxygen also dissolves in water).  It is also bad, because it makes steel boats rust.<br>  <br>  2) Pressurized vessels can burst, or become propulsive from seemingly minor changes.  So materials compatibility testing is very important.<br>  <br>  3) Drinking soda quickly can cause stomach aches because increased temperature (98 degrees in your stomach vice 34 degrees in your fridge) also releases the CO2 quickly.  This is closely related to the last point:<br>  <br>  4) Many people mistakenly contend the the CO2 is the cause of global warming.  There is a relationship between CO2 and global temps, however, the relationship is backwards. The warming global temperatures are responsible for releasing dissolved CO2 from the oceans.|`|K2umerZ0aa	i have absolutely NO IDEA!<br>  <br>  lo siento, mi amiga. ni idea.

It will continue to get higher in the sky until sometime between midnight and 12:30 a.m.when it will be in the south. You should look for the constellation Leo, which looks like a reversed question mark. Just below Leo, the brightest object is Saturn and Lulin is about halfway between Saturn and the bright star Regulus, which is the star at the bottom of the question mark. There is some information here: <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/35992534.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing...</a> and a fairly detailed star map here: <a href="http://media.skyandtelescope.com/documents/Comet_Lulin_Feb13.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://media.skyandtelescope.com/documen...</a><br>  You will need to check carefully with the detailed star map in order to find it and you will need a pair of binoculars as it only appears as a faint fuzzy blob.<br>  It will be visible on other evenings, appearing about 20 minutes earlier each night.

mH1Tnv5Naa	Not all storms contain strong winds, but those that do, have them basically as a result of two mechanisms.  One is simply the result of the updrafted air that led to the formation of the storm being cooled by rain and collapsing back to the surface creating a strong rush of colder air.  Another way is when fast mid-level air becomes caught in the downdraft and gets deflected downward to the surface. <br>  <br>  Lightning is the result of a static discharge of electricity that is produced in the storm as various particles such as snow flakes, hail, and rain strike against each other and create electrical charges which build up until a narrow channel allows two opposite charge areas to connect, creating the lightning bolt.  The bolt is very hot, and the sudden explosive heating of the air outside the bolt creates a shock wave we hear as thunder. <br>  <br>  In rare cases storms produce tornadoes usually due to low level wind shear (winds changing in speed and direction as you go up) which can create areas of rotation.

However, throw in the entire board...there's not enough rice in China (beans in Boston?).<br>  <br>  After all, 2^64 is a very large number indeed.  But remember the day before you had to give me 2^63 pennies and the day before 2^62 pennies...all the way back to 1 penny.  so its the SUM of all those days that will do you in.  Also, where in the world would I put it all?  As they say in Mexico, "Quien sabe?"<br>  <br>  Very good question.

YYJ2SlKbaa	White blood cells, or leukocytes (also spelled "leucocytes"), are cells of the immune system defending the body against both infectious disease and foreign materials. Five[1] different and diverse types of leukocytes exist, but they are all produced and derived from a multipotent cell in the bone marrow known as a hematopoietic stem cell. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system.[2]<br>  The number of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of disease. There are normally between 4×109 and 11×109 white blood cells in a litre of blood, making up approximately 1% of blood in a healthy adult.[3] In conditions such as leukemia, the number of leukocytes is higher than normal, and in leukopenia, this number is much lower. The physical properties of leukocytes, such as volume, conductivity, and granularity, may change due to activation, the presence of immature cells, or the presence of malignant leukocytes in leukemia.<br>  <br>  Red blood cells are the most common type of blood cell and the vertebrate body's principal means of delivering oxygen to the body tissues via the blood. The cells are filled with hemoglobin, a biomolecule that can bind to oxygen. They take up oxygen in the lungs or gills and release it while squeezing through the body's capillaries. The blood's red color is due to the color of hemoglobin. In humans, red blood cells develop in the bone marrow, take the form of flexible biconcave disks, lack a cell nucleus, subcellular organelles and the ability to synthesize protein, and live for about 120 days.[1]<br>  <br>  Human red blood cells<br>  Red blood cells are also known as RBCs, red blood corpuscles (an archaic term), haematids or erythrocytes (from Greek erythros for "red" and kytos for "hollow", with cyte translated as "cell" in modern usage). The capitalized term Red Blood Cells is the proper name in the US for erythrocytes in storage solution used in transfusion medicine.<br>  <br>  Platelets, or thrombocytes, are small cytoplasmic bodies derived from cells. They circulate in the blood of mammals and are involved in hemostasis leading to the formation of blood clots. Like red blood cells, platelets have no nucleus.<br>  If the number of platelets is too low, excessive bleeding can occur; however, if the number of platelets is too high, blood clots can form (thrombosis), which block blood vessels, and may cause a stroke and/or a heart attack. An abnormality or disease of the platelets is called a thrombocytopathy[1], which could be either a low number (thrombocytopenia), a decrease in function (thrombasthenia) or an increase in number (thrombocytosis).<br>  <br>  A blood bank is a cache or bank of blood or blood components, gathered as a result of blood donation, stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusions.<br>  <br>  Hemoglobin (also spelled haemoglobin and abbreviated Hb or Hgb) is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of vertebrates,[1] and the tissues of some invertebrates.<br>  In mammals, the protein makes up about 97% of the red blood cell’s dry content, and around 35% of the total content (including water). Hemoglobin transports oxygen from the lungs or gills to the rest of the body where it releases the oxygen for cell use. It also has a variety of other roles of gas transport and effect-modulation which vary from species to species, and are quite diverse in some invertebrates.|`|z70Mvu5yaa	wbc-to attack bacteria and viruses<br>  rbc-carries oxygen and nutrients to tissues<br>  Platelets-clotting<br>  Blood bank-where you donate and pick up blood?<br>  hemoglobin-I forget.

It's also part of the reason why some people become bald or have thinning hair - the growing cycle can become shorter and shorter and even stop altogether.
GASTNilgaa	It helps to pin down the terminology: to "factor" an operator means to write it as a composition of simpler ones.  <br>  <br>  What's an "operator"?  Here it is terminology for a function whose domain and range are spaces of functions.  "Take the x-derivative" is an operator; some write it D_x.  "Take the t-derivative" is another operator; some write it D_t.  These are functions that operate on functions and return functions back.  In my notation, the operator "take the x-derivative, then take the t derivative" would be D_t D_x.  "Take the x-derivative, take the t-derivative, and add them together" would be D_t + D_x.  The "operator" notation has a very algebraic flavor.  If S is one operator on functions, and T is another, the operator "do S, and then do T" would usually be written "TS" and you can think of it as a kind of "product" of T and S.  The operator do S to the input function, do T to the input function, and add the results together," which would be written "S+T",  is a sort of sum.  There is an "algebra" of operators.  "Do S, and then do S again" is usually written "S^2" in analogy with algebra of numbers.  "Squaring" an operator means doing it twice.  "Multiplying" operators together means doing one and then doing another.  The order of multiplication is a little confusing at first: if someone says "do S,  then do T", this is written TS because if you were actually doing this to a function, doing S to u is Su, and doing T to that is TSu.  So although T appears first in the notation, it is actually applied second.  <br>  <br>  Take c = 1 in your wave equation for simplicity sake.  Finding functions u satisfying u_tt - u_xx = 0 amounts to finding functions u for which [(D_t)^2 - (D_x)^2] u = 0.<br>  <br>  In analogy with algebra, we might be tempted to factor the operator as a "difference of squares" as<br>  <br>  (D_t - D_x)(D_t + D_x).<br>  <br>  This is not just an analogy, though; it is a true fact.  If u is any function whatsoever,<br>  <br>  (D_t + D_x) u is the function u_t + u_x<br>  and (D_t - D_x) of (D_t + D_x) u is thus<br>  <br>  (D_t - D_x)(u_t + u_x) = D_t (u_t + u_x) - D_x(u_t + u_x)<br>  = u_tt - u_xt - u_tx + u_xx<br>  and this is = u_tt + u_xx since mixed partials do not depend on the order in which they are taken.  So the operations represented by<br>  <br>  (D_t)^2 - (D_x)^2 and (D_t - D_x)(D_t + D_x) really are the same.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to factor an operator?  Many PDE of interest take the form<br>  <br>  "L is some linear operator.  Find all u for which Lu = 0."<br>  <br>  To say that L is linear means that L(f+g) = Lf + Lg for all functions f and g.  (Operators like D_t and D_x and products and sums of them are linear.)<br>  <br>  Suppose you can "factor" L in the sense that you can find "simpler" linear operators A and B satisfying AB = BA = L.  You have probably made the problem of solving Lu = 0 easier, because if you can find solutions to the "simpler" equations Bu = 0 or Au = 0, they are also automatically solutions to Lu = 0 (since if Bu = 0 then ABu = A0 = 0 by linearity of A, and similarly if Au = 0).  So there is a general phenomenon at work:<br>  <br>  If L is a linear operator, and L = AB = BA for "simpler" linear operators B and A, then any function of the form<br>  <br>  [a solution to Au = 0] + [a solution to Bu = 0]<br>  <br>  will be a solution to Lu = 0.  That's what's going on in (a), for example.  Here you could take <br>  <br>  L = [(D_x)^2 + D_x - (D_y)^2 - D_y] <br>  <br>  [so that Lu = 0 means that u_xx + u_x = u_yy + u_y holds]<br>  <br>  and they tell you that L factors as<br>  <br>  [D_x - D_y][D_x + D_y + 1]<br>  where here 1 denotes the "identity" operator that, when applied to u, gives u back.  You can check that L really does factor this way.  So the point of (a) is that once you have noticed this, you can try to solve the simpler equations<br>  <br>  (1) (D_x - D_y) u = 0, also known as u_x = u_y,<br>  and<br>  (2) (D_x + D_y - 1)u = 0, also known as u_x + u_y - u = 0,<br>  <br>  and having found the most general solutions to (1) and (2), you know that the sum of those will always be a solution to the more complicated equation you started with.  (And, as is often the case, the sum of the general solutions to the equations for the "factors" will _be_ the general solution to the more complicated equation.)<br>  <br>  So the "hints" about factoring in this problem are really telling you that in order to solve (a), for example, it is enough to solve the first-order equations u_x - u_y = 0 and u_x + u_y + u = 0.  So in order for these hints to be hints, you have to agree with the textbook that these first-order equations are easier to solve.  (If you _don't_ know how to solve these simpler equations, the hints are less helpful.)<br>  <br>  The Phi(x+y) and e^(-y) h(x-y) in the hint are coming from the fact that a general solution to u_x - u_y = 0 has the form u(x,y) = Phi(x+y) for some function Phi of one variable, and that the general solution to u_x + u_y + u = 0 has the form u(x,y) = e^(-y) h(x-y) for a function h of one variable.  [So, as I mentioned above, adding any two together would give you a solution to the more complicated equa

This arises because there is an unequal distribution of charged ions inside and outside of the cell - there tends to be high sodium and chloride outside of the cell, and high potassium inside.  As a result, the difference in charge (in, for example, most neurons and skeletal muscle cells) is about -70 mV.  It is more negative inside than outside.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Consider the possibilities. Let's start with just cloning of selected tissues. Just imagine what medicine would be like if any time you lost a tissue we could just make some more for you. And it would be YOUR tissue, identical to your old tissue in every way. No more amputees, no more waiting for organ donors, almost no diabetes. Whole diseases might be entirely wiped out, and permanent injury could almost become a term that's an oxymoron. Anyone who DOESN'T want this may need to have his head examined.<br>  <br>  One of the major reasons cloning was first developed was to clone genetically engineered animals. The reason we want to do this is because producing even one set of altered genes and putting them in the right place can be ridiculously hard to do... but also ridiculously beneficial.<br>  <br>  Right now almost all the insulin and clotting factor that is produced for diabetics and hemophiliacs is made from genetically engineered bacteria. Bacteria divide on their own but require relatively expensive culturing conditions. There are many genetic engineers who would like to put the same genes in a goat or a chicken so these valuable medicines could be harvested from milk or eggs.<br>  <br>  But one goat doesn't do a lot of good. You need a whole herd... possibly many herds. If you bred the altered goat you might lose much of the work you did. Instead, you need enough goats to provide a breeding, self-sufficient population.<br>  <br>  Then you would essentially be turning grass into just about any medicine in the world that you could engineer... with corresponding reduction in costs and increases in availability (and a goat as an intermediary). Anyone who doesn't want this probably also needs to have his head examined.<br>  <br>  Of course, there are other possibilities too. Cloning can't necessarily produce another Einstein or another Mozart, but it COULD produce someone with similar capabilities. You don't even need to introduce the idea of government production of geniuses - many parents would love to have an exceptionally talented child. There are even some who would love to raise a version of themselves.<br>  <br>  These would not be identical copies (you won't really have TWO of anyone)... they'd be like twins, with similar capabilities but very different personalities and identities. Obviously we don't consider twins to be a public safety issue. So why would even complete clones of other humans be? There's really no difference.<br>  <br>  Arguably, if one country develops super-powerful medicine and an unlimited bank of super-geniuses and super-soldiers, it will own the world in whatever way it wants to, unless everyone else has the same. It's a matter of record that virtually no technology has ever been discovered that hasn't been used.<br>  <br>  Don't expect all these things tomorrow. Or even in the next decade or two. Cloning science still has a long way to go. But I believe they ARE coming. It's only a matter of time.  The question before us is really whether we want to be part of the trend or just be left behind.|`|mCbChkKraa	Mankind shouldn't act as God.

AlJrVK8Gaa	Geologist and Geophysicists locate an area that has a high chance of containing petroleum.  Then a drilling engineer oversees the drilling of a well.  A drilling rig uses a rotating bit on the end of a string of pipes.  Mud is pumped trough the pipe, which comes out of jets at the bit.  The mud has 3 functions: it cools the bit, removes the cuttings (ground up rock), and provides counter pressure to fluids in the ground.  Once the well is drilled to the specified depth.  Casing is run into the well and cemented in to give stability to the hole and to seal off the well from the surrounding rock formations.  Then a series of well logs are run.  Well logging tool are run in the well bore to electrical, sonic, and nuclear readings of the rock.  The well logs tell the production engineer, exactly to the foot, where the oil and gas containing rock formations are.  Then a perforation gun that contains shape charges is run into the well.  Remember that steel casing was cemented in the well, so hole must be blown through the casing into the formation that contains the oil and gas.  The holes are shot and then the well is fractured.  Fluids are pumped through the holes at high pressure and rate to crack the formation open.  Once it is fractured the oil and gas will naturally flow out of the well.|`|PrMRKpj2aa	By chemical compounds..

Carbon is one of many elements used to date old objects, and it is only used for remains of around 60,000 years or less. Therefore, you would never use carbon dating for something like dinosaur fossils, but generally for things like human artifacts, for example. Potassium is used to date very old objects whose ages date in the millions. <br>  <br>  This type of dating is based on the fact that every element has a half-life, or time it takes for exactly half of the original amount of the element present to decompose into a lighter element. By measuring the current amount of the element, say carbon, in or around the object, and measuring the amount of the element into which it decays, scientists are able to calculate exactly how many half lifes it has gone through. Using the already-known lengths of the half-lives, scientists can then come up with an accurate estimate of its age, after factoring in other inputs.

Bigger angle, more bending to a beam.<br>  A refracting telescope has a lens with a curved surface.  Dead center, the air-to-glass interface is square to the light from a star, and no bending happens.  Farther from the center, the curved glass means the air-to-glass interface is at angles that increase with radius.  More bending at the edge occurs.  That means the width of the beam become narrower in a cone shape.  At a specific distance, depending upon the curve on the lens, the beam focuses to a dot, then expands again.  That distance is the focal length.<br>  That is the main or objective lens.  One can put film at that dot of focus to take a picture.

But it represents only part of our understanding about how the universe works.  We understand enough to realize that we don't understand it all.

Because there are five d orbitals total cr2+ has an empty d orbital.  The orbitals are split two above three with the top two being antibonding orbitals.  The jahn teller effect causes distortion to the symmetry of the molecule (because of unequal distribution of antibonding electrons).  <br>  <br>  You see color when light causes an electron to be excited and then it drops back down.  Electronic transitions are forbidden when they go to the same orbital.  Mn2+ is a forbidden transition.  Cr2+ though is Jahn teller distorted and the top two d orbitals are different enough that it becomes allowed.<br>  <br>  Long story short John teller effect makes d to d transitions allowed when they were previously forbidden.  Thus lots of color.<br>  <br>  Thats a whole year of inorganic chemistry in two paragraphs...good luck.

The numbers below the element symbol are the atomic weights, and are used in finding molar mass.<br>  <br>  5.7x10^-3 g of H2O is 3.166x10^-4 mol. then, when you multiply that number to Avogadro's number (The number of molecules in a mole, 6.022x10^23), you get 1.907x10^20 molecules.<br>  <br>  the mass of .5 mol of oxygen depends on if its just oxygen by itself, (which doesn't really occur in nature) or if it's the diatomic.

You get a node at each point that doesn't oscillate. It isn't clear from your question how many waves there are, i assume there is more information at the end of the question stating the wavelength.|`|bCktqpr5aa	What is your wavelength?<br>  <br>  A node is a point on the string that does not move. If the string is oscillating in it's fundamental frequency then you will have nodes only at the ends. The wavelength for this mode would be 24.8cm, remember the wavelength is defined as one complete oscillation, so down and up again. If, for example your string is oscillating with a wavelength of 12.4cm (twice the findamental freq) then you will get a node in the middle as well- so 3 nodes. Since this string has fixed ends you will get a node at 0, l/2, l, 3l/2 etc where l is the wavelength of the oscillation. Then you can just count.

HyUE9ON0aa	step 1<br>  <br>  Follow the ant trail to the food source. You can eliminate the trail, but unless you get rid of the source, they will just re-build it. Ants leave a scent for each other to follow. So even if the ants are gone, the scent will remain and other little scout ants can pick up the scent and begin the trail again. <br>  <br>  <br>  Step2<br>  <br>  Get rid of the food source once you have found it. Don't just put it in the trash where they can then build a trail to the trash can. It's important to wrap it in some plastic or just take it outside to a trash can or dumpster. They may still be able to smell it, but it will take them a while to rebuild the route to that particular food source. Take your time when searching for what they are eating because it could be several things in different locations, even a greasy surface can be considered food so look closely. <br>  <br>  <br>  Step3<br>  <br>  Wipe the trail free of ants with a paper towel that has been wet with warm water. Be sure to clean all surfaces where you see even one ant. If you have successfully eliminated the food source, they will not try to rebuild the trail on that particular path again. However, make sure that you do not have other things around that they could target next. These ants can quickly pick up any scent of food and you'll have another trail the next day if you don't clean the place up! <br>  <br>  <br>  Step4<br>  <br>  Spray the trail that you have just wiped down with ant spray that can be found at almost any store. After you have sprayed, put down traps for any ants that you might have failed to clean up. Some people like to spray and then wipe the trail clean. Just make sure you do both steps to remove any lingering traces of food. Ants will often try to carry the wounded or dead back home, so don't leave any stragglers either! The traps should take care of any scouts that return looking for food. <br>  <br>  <br>  Step5<br>  <br>  Most sugar ant traps have some sort of sweet bait in them so check them regularly to make sure they are still working. They may need to be replaced if they are not.

9lzNDwhZaa	Wherever you like! A lot of the oil produced from the oil shales of Alberta finds its way to the USA.<br>  <br>  "The key characteristic of the Athabasca deposit is that it is the only one shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining. About 10% of the Athabasca oil sands are covered by less than 75 metres (246 ft) of overburden. The mineable area as defined by the Alberta government covers 37 contiguous townships (about 3,400 km2/1,300 sq mi) north of the city of Fort McMurray. The overburden consists of 1 to 3 metres of water-logged muskeg on top of 0 to 75 metres of clay and barren sand, while the underlying oil sands are typically 40 to 60 metres thick and sit on top of relatively flat limestone rock. As a result of the easy accessibility, the world's first oil sands mine was started by Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited (a predecessor company of Suncor Energy) in 1967. The Syncrude mine (the biggest mine in the world) followed in 1978, and the Albian Sands mine (operated by Shell Canada) in 2003. All three of these mines are associated with bitumen upgraders that convert the unusable bitumen into synthetic crude oil for shipment to refineries in Canada and the United States. At Albian, the upgrader is located at Scotford, 439 km south. The bitumen, diluted with a solvent is transferred there in a 610 millimetres (24 in) Corridor Pipeline."

Wz9tSKTaaa	1. You're probably meant to assume that albinoism is due to a single recessive gene and that both parents are heterozygous for the gene. Whilst the chance of each child they have is 25% of being albino, it's 50% for being a carrier (heterozygous).<br>  Edit: actually bio girl is probably right there. Anyway it's a 1:2:1 ratio - 1 homozygous non-albino, 2 heterozygous/carriers, 1 albino<br>  <br>  <br>  2. The man has one dodgy gene and one normal gene. The dodgy gene causes snub fingers without any help from the female. So for each child the probability is just 50%. NB the children's gender is irrelevant - autosomal means the trait _isn't_ sex-linked, so it's a trap.<br>  <br>  a) 12.5% (50% x 50% x 50%)<br>  b) 12.5%, unless you're supposed to include the chances of having children of particular genders aside from all the genetics stuff<br>  c) either is 50%|`|FMvS3LaGaa	1.

AA11525743	The 1:2:1 ratio is the result of a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents. This means that you're mapping out a cross while observing only one allele.<br>  <br>  Aa x Aa (A = tall, a = short)<br>  <br>  Results:<br>  <br>  AA, Aa, aA, aa<br>  <br>  1 homozygous for the tall allele, 2 heterozygous for the tall allele, and 1 homozygous for the short allele. Hence, 1:2:1<br>  <br>  The 9:3:3:1 is the result of a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents.This means that you're mapping out a cross while observing two alleles. Instead of observing the genotypes, however, you are observing the phenotypes. This means that the 9:3:3:1 ratio is categorizing based on how the organisms look, not according to their letter combinations.<br>  <br>  AaBb x AaBb (A = tall, a = short, B = brown, b = black)<br>  <br>  If you use a punnett square and observe the results of this cross (just like in the first example) you'll get results that have a 9:3:3:1 ratio.<br>  <br>  Results:<br>  <br>  AABB, AABb, AaBB, AaBb, AABb, AaBb, AaBB, AaBb, AaBb<br>  AAbb, Aabb, Aabb<br>  aaBB, aaBb, aaBb<br>  aabb<br>  <br>  So now you have 9 individuals who will be big and brown, 3 that will be big and black, 3 that will be small and brown, and 1 that will be small and black.|`|623zz8d7aa	Yes. These ratios you have given are typical of those used in genetics, where you are determining the odds of certain traits being inherited by the offspring of two individuals.<br>  <br>  In the first set of numbers, add the numbers in the sequence. So, add 1+2 +1 and you get 4. What this means is there are a total 4 offspring. And of the 4 offspring, there will be one offspring of one type, two of another type, and one more of a third type. <br>  <br>  Let's say you are trying to determine the color of fur of the offspring of black bull and a white cow. With the scenario you have given, the results would be: one out of the four calves would be black, two calves would be spotted black-white, and one calf would be white.<br>  <br>  The second example is the same thing, except you are looking at two different traits, instead of just one trait - let's say color (one trait) and stem length (another trait). So, add the numbers 9+3+3+1 and you get 16. <br>  <br>  Now you are trying to determine the traits of flower color and stem length in the offspring of two "parent" flowers: One parent has white flowers and short stems and the other parent has red flowers and long stems.<br>  <br>  What will the offspring look like?<br>  <br>  When those two flowers are cross-pollinated, the odds are that you will get a ratio of 9:3:3:1. Here are the possible combinations of the two traits that can be inherited: <br>  red flowers and long stems<br>  red flowers and short stems<br>  white flowers and long stems<br>  white flowers and short stems<br>  <br>  In this particular scenario, the odds are that you will get 9 offspring of one combination, 3 of another combination, 3 of an even different combination, and one of a fourth combination. <br>  <br>  Another way of saying this is that the odds are 9 out of 16 offspring of inheriting a certain combination; 3  out of 16 of inheriting another combination, and so forth.<br>  <br>  This is a simplistic description, but it illustrates the point.|`|AA10762652	The ratios you give refer to the distribution of genotypes and phenotypes in classic Mendelian inheritance of independent genetic traits.<br>  <br>  Please see figs. 2 and 3 in the Wikipedia article "Mendelian inheritance" for a chart explaining your ratios.|`|OOFT6kseaa	The 1:2:1 ratio, is the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen in carbohydrates (C6H12O6).

OdGX5dyRaa	Solid NaCl would have a low conductance because its electrons are not very free to move around.  When in solution, however, salt dissolves ionicly creating an electrical pathway.  The conduction of electricity at that point, however, is not without its chemical changes.  The exact reaction will depend on the type of electrodes used, the density of the solution, etc.  Molten NaCl will have an even higher conductance than NaCl in H2O solution because all the bonds are relatively loose - it's just one big pool of ions.

GBJjRAzzaa	Retrovirus is a virus that transcribes its genetic material (in this case, RNA) into the host cell's DNA. Then it starts to multiply by using the host cell's mechanisms to create copies of itself, and goes on to infect other cells. <br>  <br>  The reason why drugs wont take rid the body of the retrovirus is because the retrovirus is constantly mutating, changing, and basically evolving. This enables the virus to evade the drugs. <br>  <br>  This is also the reason why a vaccine cannot be made for these viruses. The way the immune system works is that it takes a part of the virus' protein and shows it to other WBC in the body. The WBC use this protein to create antibodies, which also allow phagocytes to come and "eat" all cells that have this special type of protein on them, as well as all cells which have this kind of antibody attached to them. However, because the virus is always changing the protein, it is extremely hard to effectively fight these cells. <br>  <br>  Pharmaceutical drugs are engineered to only find a few types of proteins.... while the virus can basically make infinite variations. This makes drugs not that effective, and it will eventually tire the immune system out. <br>  <br>  HIV works by infecting and killing Helper T-Cells, and those are the cells that "tell" or activate other cells to make antibodies... if you dont have antibodies, then you cannot fight HIV by yourself. <br>  <br>  Drugs for HIV are different, and are getting better and better. In reality, they only prolong the life of the victim rather than curing the person of the infection. The HIV drugs tackle the virus in its different stages and keeps viral count low. Eventually, the virus that is resistant to the drugs will prosper and the person will die of AIDS and opportunistic diseases. <br>  <br>  Actually, I hope the information I gave you is 100% correct.... waiting for more answers.

If you mean what exactly is electricity, then here. Electricity is a flow of charged electrons moving along the atoms of a material. The reason metals conduct electricity so well is because on the molecular level they have a "sea" of essentially freely moving electrons. and those in a current travel right through. Electric current is measured in amps, which is about 6.24 × 10^18 electrons passing a given point per second. <br>  To give you an idea of magnitude, 0.00008 amps (80 microamps) is enough to give us a mild shock, and 1 amp is enough to kill us.|`|5O7dYY0taa	there are two ways to answer: where is the electricity generated or what is electricity.<br>  <br>  the first one is answered by a guy before me.<br>  <br>  the second one is that electricity is moving electrons. the electrons continuously move around and between atoms and create a current when they all move in the same direction.|`|hzAidxdkaa	those little holes in the wall
ejodXS5naa	Entangled particles are not found, they are made.  To observe entanglement, you need to have control over both particles and the ability to measure their degrees of freedom in a way that will show you entanglement.  This requires the ability to build up statistics by performing many measurements.  But after each measurement, the entanglement is destroyed.  So to make a meaningful measurement, you need many copies of the entangled particles, so you need to make them. <br>  <br>  Now how do you make them?  Well, nature does it a variety of ways.  For example, two electrons in the same atomic shell will be entangled.  But we can make them in the lab too.  Exactly how depends on the system you are talking about.  For example, you can pass a photon through a crystal which will split it into two photons (parametric down-conversion) and those two photons will be entangled.  Or, you can take two atoms that emit light and combine the light that they emit on a beam splitter with a special coincidence measurement scheme that, when the light gets measured to be in a specific state, the atoms will be projected into an entangled state.  Or you can apply a differential force to two qubits (atomic qubits in this case) which has no effect on the qubits if they are in the same state, but does have an effect if they are in different states.  Such a force can be used to entangle the qubits if the proper input states are chosen.  I guess the point is this that entangling is complicated and buried in the details of the experiment.  But it can be done and it has been done.|`|bCktqpr5aa	Wow an interesting question on this board! Also a very hard one.<br>  <br>  The theory behind quantum entanglement is that you can have two particles which are linked so that even when separated, something that effects one also effects the other. I have read a bit online about how evidence for such particles has been found and not just on the microscopic level- macroscopically too (entangled qubits to be exact). When they experiment on them they separate them and then apply a force or noticeable change to one and see how the other reacts. It's been years since I read it, but did Stephen Hawking talk about quantum entanglement in black holes? Possibly in the "Universe in a Nutshell" book?<br>  <br>  Obviously the concept of faster than the speed of light information conveyal opens up a whole basket of philosophical issues. Have you read about the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox? They aimed to show that the question "can messages travel instantaneously from one quantum entangled particle to another" leads to only two possibilities- that particle A is indeed affected by particle B which is held some distance away or that quantum mechanics is incomplete. The advances in quantum computing suggest that it is possible.<br>  <br>  If you're interested too I found this interview which talks a bit about quantum entanglement: <a href="http://calitreview.com/51" rel="nofollow">http://calitreview.com/51</a> Might be interesting for a read?
XydWCwZVaa	In general when graphing functions the graphs of y = f(x) will look the same as the graph of y-h = f(x-k).  The only difference is that the graph will be shifted in the y direction by h and the x direction by k.<br>  <br>  To graph - | x - 1 | >= y - 2 , graph:<br>   - | x | = y. This is an upside down "V" with its vertex at (0,0).<br>  <br>  Using the rule given above,   - | x - 1 | = y - 2 is the same graph with the vertex at (1, 2).<br>  <br>  To finish you need to really graph - | x - 1 | >= y - 2.  What you need to do is shade the proper area.  Pick a test point.  (0.,0) is a good candidate.  - | 0 - 1 | ?>=? 0 -2 ==> -1 >= -2 is true.  So shade the part of the graph below the "^".

Atm74ULtaa	The Earth is geologically active and the Moon is not. Therefore, the original rocks on Earth have already been reworked - subducted, melted, reformed. So, if you walk around on Earth collecting rocks you would not be collecting the original rocks, instead you would be collecting "recycled" rocks and thus they would not be as old as the originals.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you were to walk around on the Moon, you would be, for the most part, collecting the original rocks from which the Moon was formed.

pTqIbviyaa	Your tadpoles could be dying for one of many reasons. You need to make sure that they have been eating; they may be starving to death. Also, they need oxygen to survive. When they are older they have lungs, so you will need to make sure that there are air holes in the top of the cage. When they are very young, some tadpoles don't have lungs yet and thus must need a filter in their tank to ensure that there is enough dissolved oxygen in the water.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that you've been feeding them and making sure that they have air; the problem is probably that you are using tap water. Tap water has a tiny bit of chlorine in it, and even small amounts can kill tadpoles, which are very sensitive. You'll need to either let your tap water sit out for a week or so or buy special drops from a pet store which will get rid of the chlorine. If you don't think they'll make it that long, you may have to let them go; try to find a clean pond or ditch that has a lot of shallow water, but enough so that there is no risk of it drying up too soon.

2fc0f929a2e99a697c7a317c26c5e972aa	It entirely depends on the selective pressures, and furthermore, are we speaking modern civilization, hunter gatherers, pre-hunter gatherers?<br>  <br>  It makes a huge difference. There is very little selective pressures I would imagine for hair color with current technologies and diets. There is not significant advantage or dissadvantage to any particular hair color.<br>  <br>  At some point in time I imagine there were selective pressures.  But let's think about cold areas with little light, what color fur do most animals in such places have? White or translucient fur is very common in such places. This likely plays into being able to better blend in with the background, but it also coincides with Gloger's rule, which states, than animals in humid locations near the equater tend to have darker pigments, and their counterparts in areas closer to the poles tend to have less pigment. This suggests that blonde hair would be advantageous in polar regions.<br>  <br>  Here's another way to look at it. In areas of low light intensity, having darker skin was selected against because the skin pigments absorbed the light the human body needs to synth. vitamin D. This is not an issue with modern diets, but at one point it was. Now, dark hair will similarly absorb light allowing less to reach the scalp. Lighter hair absorbs less slight but reflects more, however, a decent amount of the reflected light is reflects at angles that still contact the scalp. So, there's another arguement for blonde hair.<br>  <br>  One last argument which relates to the last one is that in areas of high light intensity, having pigments protects underlying tissues from damaging UV light. In areas where light isn't so intense, this isn't so much a problem.  However, synthesizing the pigments requires energy, and before the times of hunter-gatherers life was tough and food scarce. And the most important thing in natural selection is making babies. So every little bit of energy that can be put into making more babies instead of making structures that aren't benificial is selected for. In other words, if a structure or chemical or what have you, grants no advantage in a particular environment, than it is inherently disadvantageous in the energy it wastes to create. Animals with the most free engergy to put towards making babies win.|`|9d9b8b9e4972c1f3e7d9b9e80936b200aa	Dark hair evolved at a colder place because it absorbs more of the lights energy and heats up more quickly.  light hair evolved in hot places because it reflects the majority of the sun's energy, keeping body heat lower.  If a race evolved underwater they would likely not have hair to increase hydrodynamics
9Wi2eNInaa	Your water pipe is a natural ground since it runs thru the soil. <br>  <br>  Building codes want you to have a backup ground, which is why they want you to have a grounding rod buried in the ground also<br>  <br>  You take your ohm meter and put the smallest scale of ohm's on it (either 100 ohm or 1K) and place one electrode on the outside ground wire connection and place the other electrode on a cleaned off (scrape it with a knife) place on a water pipe<br>  <br>  Your just basically measuring the resistance between your two ground sources, the water pipe and the grounding rod.<br>  <br>  The resistance comes from the wet soil distance between the two grounds sources. If you put your grounding rod to close to your water pipe where it enters the ground the resistance may be to low. That's why they specify at least 25 ohms, to make sure your grounding rod is placed far enough away from your water pipe ground|`|AaDsQi8daa	Okay, letme confirm the set up.<br>  <br>  The water pipe is metal. It is connected to the ground rod. The other end of the ground rod is connected to the earth. So that if the water contains electricity, it will be discharged. Is this correct? The only way to check would be to  connect a 25 ohm to the ground rod, and measure it. Place the red nod of the ohm meter on the outside end of the resistor, and place the black nod on the ground rod. You should be reading approx 50 ohms.
