0jCc6nf0aa	in economics, GDP (gross domestic product) is one of the measures of national income and output for a given country's economy. It is the total value of all final goods and services produced in a particular economy, the dollar value of all goods and services produced within a countryâ€™s borders in a given year. <br>  <br>  The most common approach to measuring and quantifying GDP is the expenditure method:<br>  <br>  GDP = consumption + gross investment + government spending + (exports ? imports), or,<br>  GDP = C + I + G + (X ? M).
VQZAxF5Laa	i ordered something from ups before and i wasnt there the first time, but was there the second time. all you do is sign for it. but i hope you know for sure it is ups because if you go to a fedex place, talk to one of the workers, have him search for your tracking number to tell you the status of your shipment so he can give you your package, he will tell you "i cant seem to find that tracking number". plus my friend drives an ups truck. he delivers boxes to people on a daily basis so im sure this happens at least once every 2 or 3 months. just dont worry about it. certainly nothing you need to lose sleep over. just sign for it on monday and he will hand you your order. to you. and you wont even have to worry about losing what you ordered. it wont get lost ever.|`|A3I4UJQyaa	Hi there,    UPS makes 3 delivery attempts before returning the package to the sender. In most cases, after the 3rd attempt they will hold the package at your nearest service center for 5 days so that you can pick it up.      Since they have left you an info notice, you can go to UPS.com and enter the info notice number in their tracking box to arrange to pick it up, reschedule delivery, or designate an alternate address.    If you have a neighbor that can sign for the package in your absence, you can also indicate this by writing on the info notice and leaving it for your driver.    Good luck!

Stop looking at grants for minorities or get a minority partner :)|`|hxggDuUraa	Being a small business owner, you need to pay extra attention to management of financial resources. Since growth of your business somehow depends on its financial position, you should always be cautious about cash flaw within or outside your business. It is quite true that lack of finance can become a big problem in the way of the success of your small business.     http://www.worldbestloans.com/businesslo...    Since market is crowded with various business loan schemes, every small business owner can manage to get the desired amount without any problem. Therefore if you own a new and small business organization and financial shortfall is bothering you, then these loans can prove to be the best help for you.

A3I4UJQyaa	Yikes, I experienced this with UPS just last week. I was the shipper and my customer did not receive her package.     UPS requires that the shipper contact them to initiate a trace. They will communicate with your local UPS facility and speak with the specific driver to see if he/she can locate your package where it was left. The trace can take up to 8 business days and is necessary before a claim can be filed.    If you are the recipient, contact your shipper right away. Hopefully it is adequately insured. I haven't gone through the claim process yet, but was told they will require receipts and documentation to backup the shipment value.     Good luck!|`|f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	Post office?  Go to your local branch and file a claim tomorrow morning.      UPS or Fedex, call them and ask them to do an inquiry and contact the driver, sometimes they have left it with a neighbor or in an odd place you don't see it sitting there, and the driver will be able to say where he sat it down.  If it's still missing then they will process a claim.
gYJKLTQEaa	you will need some type of identification and then a passport along with birth certificate
qxrr69bnaa	The Post Office will not call you.  If the package is too large for the box, you will find a notice to pick up something at the window.  Or, if your Post Office has parcel lockers, you will find a key in the post office box.
AA11452852	Nope.  Brothels (and all prostitution) are illegal in New York.  The previous New York governor had to resign after it came out that he had used a prostitute.  Of course, there is plenty of prostitution, but it isn't legal.    The only place where brothels are legal in the US is Nevada.    I hope this helps!!|`|AA10282618	If anyone says so don't fall for it.

vTXD8CfMaa	Hello.  I live in Asheville too and probably the best thing to look at is Asheville Craigslist, Mountain Xpress, Asheville Citizen Times, IWANNA, etc.  You may even want to go to these websites and post a wanted job ad.  I know Ingles has an online application program and Asheville Mall has a website where you can look at the individual stores.  Most all stores in the mall has online applications or just go to the mall and look for signs.  Just keep your eyes out and check websites for current openings.      Good luck!|`|3RWS93jCaa	Hi katelyn    try getting a job at fast food places like Mcdonalds or at grocery stores.    if you're interested, you can do surveys online for extra money, I know a good site thats free to join and for age 13 and up  check my blog for info and Proof of Payments|`|GhkbDqe1aa	Hi!   look at this http://miramarbeach.ws  They will pay you for people you refer.

bH51kX9Yaa	Well, since both North York and Scarborough are adjacent to Toronto, I guess we're close. Besides, University and Dundas is very accessible (St. Patrick station on the Yonge/ University-Spadina line).   G&S Dyes is about a block further west on the north side.

bru2xnlRaa	Walk into Ihop and ask them.   Any work you do and earn money is a JOB.   Your options are limited. Most businesses want you to be 16 to hire you for gainful employment.     Time to be inventive,   My suggestions to you:    Make up fliers and pass them around in your neighborhood.   Offer to do whatever work it is you want to do, such as :    Computer work, Babysit, Clean Garages, Organize Cupboards, File Papers, Wash Cars, Mow Lawns, Pull Weeds, Tutor the neighbors kids, wash Dogs, Dog sit, Clean the Pool, Assist the elderly, whatever...       Post first whatever it is you want to do or are good at ...  However, You should keep your options open and make a decision after the persons call you instead of not giving them many reasons to call.     Say you are a student and available to work on weekends|`|AA10282618	I'd try a small supermarket or deli at night stocking shelves.
