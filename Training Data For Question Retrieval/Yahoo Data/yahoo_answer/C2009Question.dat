20090309195739AAebXDh	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	I am attempting on making a  small piece of my music  stage equipment battery  powered. Tech Help?	This is a little floor box to provide phantom power to condensor mics. the piece of equipment is only like $40, but the mics it will power will be $200 and up,so "maybe" answers just dont help unfortunately :/      Ok, to start. I have a wall wart for it.      Input: 120v 60Hz 6W   Output: 9VDC 300mA      +  |----{o-----| -     (polarity, obviously)      My question. Can I make little piece of equipment run on a 9volt battery? How long would it last??         Would it be possible to set it up to run off a 9 volt battery, while keeping it possible to plug it in (if I run out of batteries)?      I thought about just soldering in the + and - wires for a 9 volt battery inside the casing, at the same point the wall wart enters the box.       Theoriticly, (if its as simple as just putting a 9 volt battery in) I would be able to plug it in and have it work. Unplug it and add a battery and it would work. But what would happen if I did all this, and I left a battery in it, then plugged it in. Would it zap my equipment? Logic tells me so. Is there a way to make it idiot proof?

20070609203624AA1OQYJ	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	IPod Music Cannot Be Found!?	I recently set my little bro up his iTunes, and copied a file of all of my music to his account so that he could put whatever music he wanted from my iPod onto his iTunes.    But when I just came in, iTunes said it couldnt locate any of his music. It was all in the same folder, but for some reason it put all the new music that HE downloaded for himself in a different folder. I dont know if this has anything to do with the problem, but I'm justly pissed off.    At first I thought I would have to delete all of his music from the iTunes library, but realized in doing that, it would also be deleted off the entire computer. Any help?

20070616164514AAU6hQk	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	MAJOR MP3 PLAYER PROBLEM! help!!!?	I have this mp3 player, but I can't put videos on it. I was able to put songs and pictures on it just fine, but I can't put videos on it. Please don't tell me I can't put videos on it because mp3s only play music. This mp3 player can play videos. When I bought it, it came with two videos that I later deleted. You can even look it up yourself, and you'll find out that it supports mpeg4. It's a Samsung YP-T9J. I would convert the videos to mpeg4, but windows media claimed not to be able to put on the mp3 player. If I didn't convert it, only the audio would be on my device. I once used a different program to put videos on my mp3 player, but it claimed that my device wouldn't allow it to go through or something like that. Please tell me what I can do to put videos on this mp3. Do I need a different program?

20070619072735AA7RTWE	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	I'm between the sidekick 3 and ID.  Which one should I get?	Since my crappy contract with sprint is coming to an end, I seriously need to get a new phone.  I've been checkin' both sidekick phones (3 and ID) and i've fallen in love with the phone itself.  The problem is that i'm very much indecisive and i don't know which one i should get.  Unlike the sidekick ID, the sidekick 3 has a camera, mp3 player, it's bluetooth enabled, and it has a memory card slot.  There is also the money factor (the sidekick 3 is around $200 and the ID only costs 100 bucks).  Considering i already own a digital camera and an mp3 player i seriously think i should get the sidekick ID, but the sidekick 3 has all in one! If any of you guys out there owns or knows any of these phones, please please help me decide!

I like my DSlite because its less clunky and has a better screen but it loses power so fast! My DS used to be able to go for at least four days of play without needing to be charge and then a day while in the red, but my DSlite needs charged almost every day and only continues to work for about a half-hour with the red light on. Why the huge difference? Is it because it takes so much power to light the screen?

Oh, What I purchased is an open box item so I can only get an exchange of the product rather than a refund in case your wondering why I don't just get a refund on the x5
