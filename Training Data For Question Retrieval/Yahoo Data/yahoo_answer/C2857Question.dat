20090226184244AArXTz6	Dining Out;Fast Food	McDonalds Interview Tips?	Tomorrow I have an interview at McDonalds. I was wondering if any of you can answer the following questions, regarding this topic.      1. What types of questions should I be ready to answer?   2. Will they hire me at the interview or is there another interview or will they just call me back?   3. My friends are telling me I should wear a long sleeved collared shirt and dress pants (dockers), what do you think, any tips?   4. My friend is 15 in one month turning 16, wil they hire him now, or should he wait. (NOT me, I'm 16)      By the way, I'm 16 years old, first job, so give me slack, I heared McDonalds is an okay first job.      Getting this interview has been a long ride, when I first put in my application I waited 4 days then checked the status of it. The manager told me that he would read over it and also told me to call back the next day. I called back he said he will try to read it, and he has been busy, he told me if he doesn't call back in 2 days, then to call him back. After two days of no one calling I called him back, he still didn't manage to read my application so he did it over the phone with me, he told me he would call me back within 2 hours to see if he needed anyone for those shifts. I waited 3 hours, no call! I called him back and he setted up an interview for the next day. Now I am scared if he tells me that he will call me after the interview, he will forget!       Thanks, I have the interview tomorrow!
