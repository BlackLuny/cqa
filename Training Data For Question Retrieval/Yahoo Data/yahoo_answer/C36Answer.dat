ivsKcwwvaa	Please try to understand. When liberals say they want the government to finance all these entitlements, that they want government to pay to support their constituents, they are talking about OTHER people's money, not theirs.<br>  <br>   How often do you hear the elitists and the socialists whine about paying more taxes? The IRS has always accepted above and beyond what you owe, in donations. These people could have contributed all of their own money that they wanted to. The IRS says very little is ever donated freely.  But that's just it, that would be THEIR money. They want their programs financed with other people's money.<br>  <br>   Every study ever done confirms conservatives give far more. Not just money. Money, blood, their time, all facets of giving. If you are not afraid to face the facts, read these written by your own liberal media.|`|A7qDWyTYaa	Shouldn't you be a lot more concerned about the right wingers who are about to be outed by USB bank for their Swiss bank accounts that were set up to defraud the IRS and America?|`|sJeR0kzUaa	All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.|`|AWQ5VHeqaa	they probably have their money in secret swiss bank accounts where it can not be taxed and no one will know exactly how much they have.
A7qDWyTYaa	YES ! Talk about Christmas coming early for the Dems. <br>  <br>  Those unemployed, and those who might well become homeless, (in those respective states) will soon be the face of the Republican Party--the same Party whose hands off, deregulation, MORE TAX CUTS policies have bankrupted our country.|`|h2LmAM0Baa	Pretty sad if you live in one of those states and need the money, but in reality, the dems attached a stipulation to this bill so states could get money even if their governors refused it.<br>  <br>  U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., the No. 3 House Democrat, said the governors — some of whom are said to be eyeing White House bids in 2012 — are putting their own interests first.<br>  <br>  "No community or constituent should be denied recovery assistance due to their governor's political ideology or political aspirations," Clyburn said Wednesday.<br>  <br>  In fact, governors who reject some of the stimulus aid may find themselves overridden by their own legislatures because of language Clyburn included in the bill that allows lawmakers to accept the federal money even if their governors object.|`|i790R5DXaa	No they are NOT INSANE<br>  <br>  Obamas shrewd economic team didn't like the sound of stimulus program. It sounded too much like Bush's rebate checks, which didn't work. <br>  Of course, one of the key elements of this plan is a $500 rebate per person.<br>  <br>  The term investment is used quite often in this plan. Investment in infrastructure, education, green initiatives, and energy are the backbone of the plan.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself WHY WE HAVE  156,000 structurally deficient bridges, crumbling water pipes, antiquated power grid, urban decay, and dangerous schools.<br>  <br>  It is BECAUSE  WE HAVE RELIED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE THINGS WITH TAXES WE HAVE ALREADY PAID. <br>  <br>  NOW WE ARE SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT A PROGRAM WITH FUTURE TAX DOLLARS TO DO WHAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE??????????<br>  <br>  When you are stuck in a traffic jam next year and see six union construction workers standing on the side of the road all making $50 an hour watching one guy with a jack hammer working, know that your tax dollars have been spent wisely. (lol)<br>  <br>  A:~)|`|KMASS2Gmaa	Because it will not do any of the things you list all it will do is bankrupt the country.<br>  <br>  Do you have a family? If you are in financial trouble with your family budget, how do you get out of trouble. SPEND YOUR WAY OUT?<br>  <br>  Sounds like pure stupidity to me.|`|sJeR0kzUaa	No, it's not sad, it's actually one of the few bright spots in this whole orgy of spending.<br>  It's nice to see someone who has some principles they try to actually live by.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	No, they're smart. The ones who take government "charity" will end up even more broke than before.|`|6100f239c1abd562ada33e5323d1c871aa	It would be correct to say that what these governors are doing is political as they are politicians after all and from the party which directly opposes that to which the current and elected President, Barack Obama belongs.  They are jockeying for position and looking forward to future political campaigns of their own.<br>  <br>  They might also be a bit short sighted in that they will supposedly turn down funds that could and should be used to make necessary repairs to the infrastructure, help their ailing school systems, hospitals, etc.  They are doing this at the expense of their constituents but such behavior and demonstrated ego is nothing new for politicians who long ago stopped representing the people of this nation so as to represent their own personal interest and ambitions.<br>  <br>  That having been said, the proposed stimulus package and plan as the same has been put forth by the current administration is, at the very best, only a stop gap measure that, in short time, will fail utterly and completely and which to date has not improved the nation's economy or that of the world one iota.  In fact, it has had just the opposite effect.<br>  <br>  The plan is simply trying to re-establish the status quo and to keep the failed and failing system of unregulated capitalism in place by paying the crooks, con men and outright theives who have been running and ruining the system to continue to do the same instead of jailing them, fixing the obvious and glaring problems within the system of the economy and re-establish a government that represents, serves and protects its citizens as such was originally envisioned by the founders of this once great nation.<br>  <br>  The USA is an immoral, amoral, unethical mob inspired by greed, materialism and consumerism that is slowly destroying itself and taking much of the rest of the world with it.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, morals and ethics can not be forced upon a people, nor can intellgence and foresight.  As such is no longer being taught by parents, educators and political , as well as religious leaders, nor practiced by them, nothing is likely to change until we all sink to the bottom and then begin to pull ourselves back up.<br>  <br>  Historically, in reaction to such event, the pendulum often swings to another extreme ( think of the rise of Nazi Germany and Hitler prior to World War II, the Russian revolution, Chairman Mao and the rise of communisit China as examples) and it takes a long while thereafter before it returns to it mid point of a more stable society if it does so at all.<br>  <br>  Solutions exist but they will be and will appear harsh by the standards of most however, sooner or later they will necessarily have to be put into place.  Thomas Jefferson told us long ago that unregulated capitalism will destroy itself.  Capitalism, with its "me first-let the buyer beware" attitude that oppresses all but a privileged and wealthy few leads only to eventual class struggle which is often violent.  We have refused to learn from the past hisitory of our own system and that of the many other historical systems that have existed and so we are doomed to repeat them.<br>  <br>  May we all be blessed and rightly guided during these horrific, desparate and frightening times and those that are immediately ahead of us.

ezQ44NqAaa	Comparing the two,is like comparing a Matchbook to a Solar Flare.They aren't even related issues,other than that a life is at stake.But I find it silly to compare the Execution of a Vicious Criminal,to the Cold Blooded,Pre-Planned murder of an unborn infant.Especially since 90% of the time the Abortion is carried out basically so the "mother" won't be inconvenienced.So how does one justify supporting the biggest Genocide in Human History,but at at the same time want to protect vicious animals that have spent their entire lives preying on their fellow humans.If you can get the Pro-Abortion people to explain that in a logical way,that I would like to see.<br>  <br>  AD|`|W0VL46gDaa	I believe anyone that has an abortion should get capital punishment.<br>  <br>  eye for an eye sounds about right.|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	Unborn children haven't committed any crime.  Death row inmates have committed the most serious ones.|`|19L99wvCaa	I have always worked toward trying to not be in a position in which I would need to even consider abortion as an option for myself. Fortunately, my efforts paid off. For me, abortion would have been a last resort. I do not have the right to dictate other women's choices in this matter.<br>  <br>  I truly hope that I will never be a juror in a capital punishment case. I do believe that there are some crimes that are so heinous that a death sentence is to be considered.|`|9VaWal2Daa	because it's like comparing apples to oranges, and trying to find a custom fit to one problem, in an off the rack kinda world. <br>  <br>  Abortion, is a deeply personal. often painful choice, that has to be evaluated on a case by case basis.......and no one  govt regulation, is gonna  "fit all" comfortably. <br>  <br>  Therefore, the smartest thing to do.......is provide the OPTION, legally, and HOPE it is applied WISELY. <br>  <br>  a better question might be, how do republicans yell about pro life.......but then refuse to teach their kids about sex?  Why do they OPPOSE sex education so much, which might PREVENT the need for so many abortions????<br>  <br>  Does abstinence really work????????   Does anyone with a functioning brain and active brain cells, really BELIEVE that? <br>  <br>  Yeah, SURE it works, 100% of the time........har har........<br>  <br>  Yeah, IFFFFFFFFFFF you can just get kids to stop fooling around. <br>  <br>  Good luck with all that........in trying to reverse raging teenage hormones and undoing the universal urges in every human on the planet. <br>  <br>  Let me know how that goes for repulicans!<br>  <br>  I didn't see it working too well in Palin's own home.......so, how well is it gonna work anywhere else...with even less "expert" supervision? <br>  <br>  As for Captial Punishment..........again---------should... be used for traffic violations, or cases where there is some DOUBT........<br>  <br>  but in cases where you can PROVE ya have the right guy, and he murdered someone or molested some kid.........<br>  <br>  you FORFEIT your right to live among decent people.  <br>  <br>  End of story..........throw the switch......and problem solved.

Throw the switch!|`|2aERh7hlaa	I can only explain my point of view and that is pro-life(I believe in protecting the innocent.) and Pro death penalty (punish the guilty.)|`|82e62204f1233511508a75bdb7acf417aa	agrees, babies don't have a choice in being born, they are innocent, people that kill know right from wrong and deserve the punishment due!! I am pro life and pro death penalty!|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	Abortion is killing helpless, innocent life.  These lives were conceived because of others irresponsibility and are then treated like trash to be disposed of.  They had no way to escape human cruelty.  Adoption is always an alternative.<br>  <br>  Death penalty is killing those who have with premeditation, cruelly killed someone Else's innocent life.  These people think  no one Else's life is significant.  They pose a danger and leave good people at their mercy.  They are like child molesters who care nothing about taking a child's life or at least traumatizing and stealing that child's innocence.|`|MPavjXO6aa	Everyone has the right to life. That does not mean, that in the case of murder, that the offender retains the right to continue living. Murderers cannot be rehabilitated, just like child molesters. It makes absolutlely no sense to allow someone who has committed either crime to continue their life while their victim and the victim's family had to relive the horror of the crime for the rest of their lives. Prisons were designed to keep those who cannot conform to the laws that we as a society have enacted to maintain order and decency. The idea of rehabilitation only came about in the 1800s, when prison populations were out of control. Do we run our prisons efficiently enough? thats debateable. Do we need to stop wasting money on inmates that commit crimes like murder or molest innocent children? Absolutely. That is why there is a death penalty in many states. Not to mention saving the cost of housing, feeding, clothing, educating, and paying the inmate for the course of his incarceration.<br>  <br>  When a criminal knows that he will face severe punishment, and that it will be dealt swiftly, this reduces the impulse to commit the crime. If a system protects the offender, and offers him better comforts than those we provide for the military forces that protect our freedoms, then where is the incentive to live according to society's laws?|`|JP1o1ggZaa	Pro Life is preserving innocent life.Being pro life does not murder anyone.<br>  <br>  death penalty is punishing the guilty according to the law for murder.|`|3lur9XHOaa	How is it contradictory?  Name the crime that the fetus performed to warrent it's death...besides being inconvenient.|`|IH6NrVNBaa	Everyone has the right to live, until they make the decision to kill someone.  Then they deserve to die...painfully.|`|alQ5wIVqaa	Innocent until proven guilty.|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	it has to do with killing innocent over killing guilty|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Actually simple<br>  <br>  The belief that abortion is taking a life is a religious conviction peculiar to the religious right (it's not a "Christian" belief; there's nothing in the Bible to support it.). It's a 19th century invention of "Christian" fundamentalists).<br>  <br>  So there is no contradiction for non-Christians--or for real Chrstians.  Many don't agree with abortion as a matter of personal belief--but recognize tha tit's a personal matter,, not one tha tis or should be subject to state control. Keep in mind that the equating of "pro-choice" with "pro-abortion" is a right-wing propaganda ploy.<br>  <br>  As for capital punishment, that's even simpler. No system of justice is error free. Being pro-capital punishment means supporting a system that will kill at least some innocent people--and totally without any justification, since it's entirely possible to protect society by incarcerating heinous offenders for life. So supporting capital punishment boils down to supporting legalized murder o f nnocent people.<br>  <br>  No contradictions there. Not on the liberal side. There is a contradiction on the "conservative" pseudo-Christian side . They assert a fetus is a human being--and claim they want to "protect life." Leaving aside the fact that conservatives are more likely to have abortions than the general population (seriously--go look up the statistics sometime). you can't square the so-called concern for life with capital punishment (the logic that shows it means taking innocent life unnecessarily still holds).<br>  <br>  YOU cannot resolve the hypocrisy of the conservative stance. You can explain it however. In either situation the religious right arbitrarily defines themselves as morally superior to and entitled to judge others and to impose those beliefs and dictate/control the actions of others without regard to legal principles. Or ethical ones.  In a political context that is called dictatorship--in other words, the motive is power over others.|`|sJeR0kzUaa	I'm pro life, but also against the death penalty, so this question doesn't necessarily apply to me, but...<br>  <br>  My guess would be that the innocent babies these women murder have not violated any law or harmed another person, except that it's just "inconvenient" right now for mom to have a baby, so we rip it apart and throw it away.<br>  The people on death row, have been found guilty of the most heinous crimes, particularly taking someone else's life, that is where the distinction comes in.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	To answer, pro choice is not pro abortion.  <br>  <br>  Pro choice is letting the individual choose to do or NOT do to their own bodies.  I can't stress that enough.  There is no such thing as pro abortion.   Women don't go to clinics when convenient, get the procedure and start the process all over again.  It is a very delicate and highly emotional process that the majority of women do not take lightly.  <br>  <br>  I am pro choice and I am for capital punishment.   I believe that some people's crimes are so heinous and there is absolutely no chance at rehabilitation that putting them to death is actually a humane thing to do.    I also believe a person has a right to choose to die.<br>  <br>  The only problem I have with Capital Punishment, is that that the person must be without a doubt guilty of the crime.  DNA tests have actually freed death row inmates.<br>  <br>  It also costs more to house death row inmates than other inmates.  People think, they get killed, no free housing and food.  That is not the case, they can be in death row for up to 20 years.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|VPwlGRX8aa	A lot of pro life people are vengeful busybodies that like to mettle in other peoples business and like to see people be punished.<br>  <br>  A lot of pro choice people do not think people should be accountable for their actions.

Totally ignoring the personal and bsininess tax cuts tht have always proven to work under, Kennedy, Reagan and Bush II.  It is important to remember that this is not a typical recession caused by monetary /inflation problems, but rater a failure of Congress to monitor prediatory lending practices and the burst of a housing bubble.   Even the auto companies will receive lots of money, but the unions will not have to make concession in medical and pension benefits, so it will be good money going after bad sicne the major cause of the problem, union greed, will not be addressed and they will be in the same situtation a year from now.

You will quickly learn that there is a business cycle and when it occurs the party in power gets blamed. no matter if it is the Democrats or the Republican. <br>  <br>  Get over the politics of envy and pay attention to how things really  work.  Ignore the demigods.and populists.   This is a hard market and down economy - take care of yourself, preserve capital and don't worship at the feet of the  Socialist Saviour.  Young people today have an historic opportunity to invest at the bottom of a mega cycle.

They aren't any particular stripe, except enslaved by their own emotions and (judging without adequate knowledge) prejudice.|`|gHLryouJaa	Ann Coulter is deliberately hyperbolic in her remarks, and frequently over-the-top in some of her statements, because she says things that are sardonic humor but are easily interpreted as literal statement rather than deliberate hyperbole ( such as her saying we should conquer the whole middle east and convert it to Christianity.   Or that the 9-11 widows are "enjoying" their husbands' deaths, in their celebrity as beyond-reproach anti-Bush/anti-Iraq-war spokespersons for the DNC that are held up by Dems as above criticism or response from the GOP.)  <br>  <br>  All these statements of Coulter's have an intelligent context that redeems them, but few  liberals are informed enough or interested enough to see her context.<br>  <br>  <br>  When Coulter is on her game and citing facts to back up her statements, her commentary is spot-on and very insightful.<br>  <br>  I just wish she'd lay off the partisan red-meat hyperbolic remarks, and stick to making reasoned fact-based arguments.  <br>  Her hyperbole often poisons her more reasoned arguments.|`|nO1I48WIaa	She has many conservative values sadly the GOP has abandoned and should return to.

If there could be a one-day amnesty for all of us to say what we think about everything I'm sure it would be a real eye opener for the Government and PC brigade. The fact that people can't or won't speak out doesn't mean that everyone agrees with the way things are.|`|M7GnRpd0aa	No I think it started long before that.

ZvKw1XDmaa	Lil bowie, Misty's answer is actually quite logical. It just takes a bit of thought to understand it. Russia was an ally in WW2, which would be why it was "shot down in error". <br>  <br>  If the plane was ditched, then that was a crash. It obviously didn't return to the airport, unless they mean in the back of another plane, lol. <br>  <br>  Personally, unless I was under threat at the time, I would not have signed without an interpreter from my country of origin.|`|cc9fd1e80d4f3f3e0531c81601acf1d6aa	A forced landing would be more appropriate.|`|PgSmcsLDaa	Sounds like it crashed if it wasn't repaired.

Unless he was a POW and forced to sign it, he didn't have to do a damn thing they said.<br>  <br>  And by the way (and why didn't anyone else catch this) Russia wasn't our enemy in WWII! They were our allies...and Misty - your statement is completely contradictory and incorrect.|`|ab6eFdlDaa	Obviously he didn't have control of the plane when it hit and it landed all weird so I would say a crash landing or a forced landing.

eu6UQElYaa	Opposition: Animal testing has provided extremely valuable information in terms of medicine that has helped save the lives of countless numbers of people.  Diabetes and the development of insulin is an example.  <br>  Animal testing is necessary because it's more reliable than computer programs and safer than testing on humans early in the life of a medication.<br>  <br>  Government: It's inhumane to test on animals when the results of medical testing can be disabling or even deadly.<br>  Often times the animals that are tested on are chimps and they are usually infants so it can be argued that it's cruel to take an infant chimp from it's mother to run biological tests on it in a lab, especially since these animals are so genetically close to humans and have many of the same emotional, physical and social needs as humans.|`|NnFltKgsaa	how can a debate exclude opinion?

Unless those who didn't earn it are opposing their liberal agenda and as long as they aren't taking from them.  Don't bother giving your own time and money, let the government do it for you.   Pretend to be for "women's rights" but say nothing when Democratic leaders, liberal bloggers and other left wing nutjobs defend Hezbollah and Hamas who have committed more than their fair share of human rights violations against women.  Claim to have the best interest of the country in mind but then defend those who would like to see us destroyed (Hamas, Iran, Iraq, terrorist suspects etc.) against the "evil" America.   Defend the right for baby rapists and murderers to live but deny the right for unborn children to live.

They were SOL, but today they get a pass.<br>  One thing I don't like is that a lot of these homeowners are saying as their defense "The mortgage companies were handing out the money"<br>  So, yes they are to blame to a degree, but if you know you can't afford it you shouldn't sign on the dotted line.<br>  I'm saving money every month, have been doing so for the past 10 years of my marriage.

a04d8ba01741e52edd70eed372868226aa	Blagojevich was a parasite of the Democratic party. Burris is just the end symptom.<br>  <br>  When Blagojevich nominated Burris, it was a finger poke in the eye of the Democratic party, which had abandoned him. There was little the Democrats could do to oppose him, since Burris was fairly popular, and the Republicans were eager to exploit the image of the Democrats turning away the only Black Senator.<br>  <br>  Now, Burris' image is falling apart, and he'll probably go back to Chicago. If the Democrats lose a seat, so be it. They're still in charge.

He has not stood by any of his friends that got in trouble or did something questionable. He doesn't have to agree with him, but Obama is quick to throw you to the dogs.  When the pirates attacked that US cargo ship, he didn't say a word, instead he said that he needs to focus on the economy. True, but come on those were Americans out there.  Then he said, that one of his agency will handle it.  Obama did come in and called them hero's after the fact.  So that is like coming in after a battle and saying good job, what happened to you before that "COMMANDER IN CHIEF"<br>  <br>  Obama can only handle one thing at a time, so we must be patient with him.  We don't want Mr. Cool (as called by a commentator for MSNBC) to be frazzled by handling 2 or 3 things at the same time like, other presidents have done.<br>  <br>  So no, Obama could care less about you or me. Only about appearing to look cool.
eu6UQElYaa	He's involved in at least a couple of the MANY corrupt actions of Blagojevich even if he isn't involved in the senate seat deal (which I'm not positive about).   I mean, let's see Obama campaigned for Blago not once but TWICE (great judgement there buddy).   And he was Senator of the very state where Blago was Governor, so he worked with him constantly (unless he really did spend all of his time campaigning for the next office in line).   Hard to believe that he wouldn't have known anything about it and wouldn't have been involved at all.  I mean that's a pretty naive view to take.|`|rrSaoOK2aa	yes, there is more to it than we have learned so far|`|BpcgaJd4aa	I'm sure he's got his fingerprints somewhere on it.

The prediction of the future that this Owalo supposedly told of is the culmination of biblical descriptions, compiled after mongrelizing different commentaries on the descriptions given by Daniel,John, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and other prophets who warned of future events that pertain to the antichrist, or more correctly, the lawless one.

Its downfall has not been the system itself, but its perceived value by the electorate, against other priorities in their lives.<br>  <br>  Democracy requires the participation of the electorate, not only once every four years in the polling booth but every day in staying vigilant in monitoring that election promises are being honoured and demonstrating their displeasure when they are not.<br>  <br>  Throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty first, politics, like religion, democracy appears to play a less and less relevant role in society, being replaced by a myriad of diversions from these lofty subjects.<br>  <br>  This apathy towards their role in the democratic process in the UK is exploited by the Government, who have dumbed down the Nation, to a point that they can do, say or promise anything without fear of revolt.<br>  <br>  Comparing the electoral campaigns of the US & UK, the enthusiasm, euphoria, participation and campaigning fever of the US, makes the process in the UK look like a wet blanket, concealing a damp sqib on a rainy afternoon in Rochdale. The majority of our MPs and hopefulls could not fill a phone box, never mind a football stadium!<br>  <br>  Democracy in the UK comes low down the list after Eastenders, Big Brother, the DFS sale and all the other things that the electorate consider a higher priority the the Nation, and Government will continue to take advantage and manipulate them as they see fit.<br>  <br>  But that is precisely what democracy is, dont kick the system, the system is sound, but nobody wants to use it.|`|S3ktbzDNaa	There's never been one that fits my ideals as well as a democracy. What do you want, Feudalism? Fascism? Theocracy? Aristocracy?

05uA8cNqaa	It'd be helpful if you're more specific about your profession. You're a banker, but what do you do? There's even a category for tellers, so I find it hard to believe that your occupation isn't listed. You just have to figure out what they call it. <br>  <br>  For example, there's a category for "1434 Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Clerks" which basically can be just defined as a bank teller. And when you look at the titles under that category, there are 71 possible job titles, including "automatic teller machine (ATM) clerk," which I find funny since isn't that just a machine? lol<br>  <br>  I've gone through this myself. It's cliche, but you have to think outside the box about what your job title may be. But don't go so far that your actual job and the category you selected has either little or nothing to do with one another.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ade3d3f3ca191c9247976e755ae8c508aa	We already have more than enough bankers...or do you mean teller because we have even more of those here?<br>  <br>  If you don't qualify under the skilled category then your choice is limited to having an immediate relative sponsor you, since, by your post, your life does not appear to be in danger.<br>  <br>  Do you understand that Canada is experiencing a very deep and worsening recession and that there are too few jobs out there for our own citizens? You may be better off staying where you are for the next 3-5 years before reconsidering. In the meantime, go back to school and upgrade your skills and education.|`|AA10258539	If this is the only category that you will be able to apply for, then you must re-invent yourself. Meaning, study again in a category that is included in the 38 priority list. That way you can come sooner. But I must warn you, foreign education credentials are not recognized in Canada. Even if that is what they evaluated you on, you will not be able to find a job in that category IF you did not graduate in Canada AND have Canadian experience.

I am an ectomorph, so I can eat large amounts of food, yet never gain weight.|`|4TT8lSgwaa	Or it is an issue of self control and responsibility, which is lacking in this nation.|`|AA11593971	Like smoking, if losing weight was merely a matter of knowing that it was important to do, we'd all be skinny. But it's not that easy. Smoking AND eating AND any bad habit for that matter serves a purpose in our lives. We don't purposefully do harmful things to our bodies. But the long-term consequences of our habits are outweighed by the short term benefits we get from doing it. And, yes, you do get benefits from smoking as well as eating the wrong things.    Unlike smoking, you can't STOP eating. Therefore, you're always exposed to the very thing that got you where you are... food. Then there's exercise. Years ago we had no choice but to exercise, because it was built into our daily routine. We couldn't escape it. Now our jobs and leisure time are built around sedentary activities. Then there's genetics. It does play a role as well. What's more, there is increasing evidence that genetic changes occur as people get more obese... changes that make it increasingly difficult to lose weight... no matter how hard you try. In fact, these same changes make it increasingly likely that you will GAIN weight. AND that these changes can be passed on to the children, meaning that they will be BORN with the predisposition to obesity.

The second part the answer is no they don't. This what happens when you have a cult of personality. Certain percentages of the populace are blinded to the reality against all reason to the contrary. Obama has already exposed himself as a liberal. He has proved that his talk of ethics was just empty rhetoric. Yet the faithful continue to defend blissfully blinded. I do not see that changing anytime soon. However for those who just wanted an end to the Republican domination, it will be interesting to see how fast they turn on him when his policies begin to negatively effect their lives and finances.|`|L1SeinzRaa	I really think he wants to be King...|`|8hNi1pGnaa	And I suppose you liken yourself to that kid eh?

He simply hasn't developed skill in dealing with his peers in Washington.  His lack of tack, for example, offended people in the legislature, leading to the organizing of a 100% party line vote against his most important project so far.    Don't get me wrong.  The bill could very well stand revision (to say the least) but the point still stands.  I thought much less of Bush's policies, but at least he was smart enough to know when opposition was forming and who he would have to be close to in Washington.  That's just a fact of life in politics if you want anything to pass.|`|uKaj1kHfaa	Is it ok to hug my doctor?  if he has hugged me before? I've been seeing my doctor regularly for depression for almost 2 years. Sometimes he hugs me or caresses me, though the last few appts. he hasn't. He is back together with his ex-wife which may have something to do with it - maybe he feels less free around other women. He never used to hug me or touch before he divorced her and now doesn't since he's been back with her. Anyway, I feel kind of hurt that he stopped hugging me for some reason - I feel like it helps after our discussions, as a stress release. I've thought about it and don't have any sort of interest in him other than a confidante. I've sometimes gotten the impression through things that he's said and his actions that he's attracted to me and worry that he'd get the wrong idea if I hug him. I just am used to hugging/being hugged after having heart to heart discussions like we have.

He does that very well and everyone finds him quite friendly and nice.  It would really be great if he only understood what works and doesn't work in this world, instead of relying on the impractical Liberal viewpoint for everything.  So, he is just an empty suit, a very pretty empty suit, but nonetheless completely empty.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	No one ever said he wasn't a politician.  What he is in addition is someone who can speak more eloquently and intelligently about issues that face this country than anyone I've seen in a long time.  Take for example his speech on race a few months ago.  I've never heard a politician speak so profoundly on that issue.  Bottom line is he has inspired people to want to do better.  The challenge is to maintain and funnel that positive energy in the right direction.  At the same time he has proposed ideas to deal with problems that have faced this country for a long time.  No one is saying that everyone has to agree with him, and he would be the first to try and temper unrealistic expectations.  What would be worse, however, is undue cynicism and disregarding his policies simply because of his party affiliation.|`|fMnM01isaa	Obama is not 'just another polilician'. He's a damn good one. He knows exactly what the public wants to hear. He is likely the smartest politician ever to be president. The problem is that he is only one man, and what little good he can accomplish in the 4 or 8 years he's in office will mean nothing in the long term outworking of the problems that this country, or rather this world is facing.  I truly belive that Obama is a very sincier person, but if the problems that we all face, like poverty, poor health, starvation, crime, wars, unforseen deaths, and for that matter death itself could be solved by a man, don't you think that someone would have already solved them?.|`|EhYwDj64aa	Obama is not Abraham Lincoln    Obama is not Frankly D Roosevelt    Obama is not John F Kennedy    Obama really has not done anything yet really    There is so much hype around him that he is bound to disappoint.

I think we can all agree that the effects of these policies wont be obvious until the end of his first term at the very least.

eu6UQElYaa	Not just Republicans are mad about this bill.  The majority of citizens are mad about this bill and the reason they are angry is because the first bill that came through was more than 800BILLION dollars in spending (the largest spending bill this country has EVER seen).    And unfortunately the majority of it was going towards repaying favors, left wing agendas like providing condoms for people overseas, and just general wasteful spending while less than 10% of the bill went towards infastructure and helping to build the economy here in the States.   <br>  The second bill was only cut to more than 700 Billion in spending and was rushed through Congress so fast that no one could've possibly read the thing.  It passed and no one really even knows what's in it.  The last one was so full of pork and a one sided agenda that it's likely this one was as well, but Congress wouldn't even take the time to allow it to be read nor would they allow it to be reviewed by the people (so much for Obama's transparency in Government, he had promised the American people at least 48hrs to review the bills going through Congress).   That's why people are angry.  They feel that we've just passed a completely wasteful bill that even the President himself doesn't have a lot of confidence in.   It's estimated that most American families will see about $13 dollars a week from the bill while their children will be paying off a near trillion dollar debt for the majority of their adult lives.|`|M3maZgdyaa	The stimulus is a plan to Nationalize our country.

Our government is spending money like a drunk sailor and then handing us the bill, preaching economic salvation through spending, wasting paper writing a bill so large that no one has time to read it, and packing more pork then a pig farm, throwing good money after bad, and  implementing a bigger government, when in fact, they need to shrink it and let the house of cards fall. The quickest way to recovery would be to let those who go under, go under. Let businesses that are in the financial slipstream file for protection and reorganize under chapter 7, 11 13, etc. Tell the auto makers to build a better mouse trap or get out of the mouse business. Let the unions figure out how to negotiate to survive, and let the banks and loan companies foreclose until they're making the payments themselves.

Simply allow the economy of the United States to fall to the lowest level of equilibrium as possible...that'll work!  Millions of homeless Americans and millions of empty houses all at the same time.  Millions of jobless Americans when there's so much work that needs to be done.  When we were (and still are) spending a billion borrowed dollars a day on two stupid back to back wars nobody but a few fuzzy headed 'liberals' complained.  Now, when it's Americans that could use a little help with essential social and physical infrastructure instead of Iraqis and Afghans it's the end of the world.  Maybe someone should run this through on of those mega-computers and see what the results of doing nothing would be...I'd love to see the outcome.  My bet is that all of the folks that are moaning about how awful this 'stimulus' is will be singing a different tune when it's their turn to be jobless, homeless and hungry.

So someone bought a house with a $2,500.00 a month mortgage, and they are behind, now I have to pay for them to be in house that they never should have bought?  They are only going to get behind again is what I think.  Why not help those who are paid up and struggling?  Why help those who bought what they knew they couldnt afford.  Or at least those who have lost jobs?

I'm going to exercise it and call you an idiot for talking about peoples mothers.      Dont be an f-tard.|`|3yrpDNavaa	The First Amendment does exist in school.  It's just that a student's right to free speech is far more limited in a school than it is elsewhere.  The school administration has a right to prohibit speech it considers disruptive, and trash talking is disruptive.  You will have little or no problem making comments, positive or negative, about the government, the president, congress, or other political entities.  You, and in fact the public in general, have far greater First Amendment rights to political speech than non-political speech.    Flags represent political speech, which is why Tinkers won.

After WWII, there was still segregation and discrimination. The discrimination was nation-wide, not just slated to the South, so get that out of your head. After Vietnam, however, things had changed because of the Civil Rights movement and they were treated the same as the white veterans. The bad part was that all the Vietnam veterans were mistreated by the Left, who threw rocks and tomatoes at them and called them "baby-killers." The Vietnam veterans banded together and put a stop to that nonsense. BTW, I know about the rock and tomato-throwing because it happened to one of my loved ones.|`|AA11634870	In your Chicago we were given a ticker tape parade, many thanks to the people of Chicago and Mayor Daley.

You support Affirmative Action, you support racism.    Because supporting an institution based on racism, is racism.    There is no need to classify "black" people as anything but Americans.    The irony is, that "black" people came here to America in 1619, the same year that English (white) women did. I don't see anyone hyphenating them.    Learn your history, and get beyond the hate that is labeled as love by liberals.    "Black" people fought for this country before there was a country. "Black" people fought in the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, and every other war this country has been involved in.    This country defined these people as "black" for political and legal reasons.     Looks like we are still doing it.     Are you going to be part of the problem, or part of the solution?    The problem is continuing the outdated, racist concept, practice, and legal definition of race. The solution is doing away with the whole racist concept, which means (gasp!) doing away with racist, divisive government programs, like Affirmative Action, which doesn't even really do anything, short of making self important white liberals happy with themselves.    "Black" people were doing for themselves, achieving, and excelling long before any government wanted to so call "help" them, and in fact they did this when their own government overtly wanted to hurt them and hold them back.    "*****" is a term that always meant slave. It wasn't meant for the free people of Africa. It is like calling a fish a sardine. A fish isn't a sardine until it goes into the can. The same way with slavery. While they were free, they were Asanti, Yoruba, Ife, and Efe, but when they went into the "can" of slavery, they only became one: *****.    You can call it "colored", you can call it "Afro-American", you can call it "black", you can call it "African-American", but it is all the same. It is all racist. It is all seperating a people from a country that is rightfully theirs.|`|AA10492075	I wasn't there but I assume that they weren't treated as well as they deserved to be treated based on reading stuff, history class in college, documentaries and on observations from people I know who lived through those eras (my older brother, father, and step-father).  I think your question is good even if it is rhetorical because each February we are quick to celebrate the contributions that black people have made, I don't think we are that willing to reconcile ourselves with the amorality of our history.  I served this country and I love it but I regret as an American (not as a white person) for things that my government did to Native Americans, Black People, Japanese People during World War II.  I think this feeling of regret is good because it is what will cause me too stand up for the next group that might suffer discrimination.

These cases should be expedited quickly and the majority returned to their own countries. My attitude to asylum seekers is that those who are trouble makers in their own countries are quite likely to be trouble here so I would look at their circumstances very critically.<br>  <br>  I believe that those under suspicion of committing crime should be held no longer that 72 hours. If a terrorist suspect is about to act, he or she will be in possession of arms, explosives or other illegal substances and can be charged with the relevant offence(s). Those suspected of being in the planning stages of a crime may be observed until they commit a crime and may then be arrested and charged.|`|NyQjxmydaa	Terrorist don't deserve to be treated with any human rights<br>  make examples of these murdering pigs send them back to where they come from let the onus be on their host countries to inflict whatever punishment they deem necessary, and to those that have heavy bleeding hearts plead with Jordan or whomever to be Christian and see what they say, how many of you nanny do gooders have sons and daughters fighting for your and others freedom rightly or wrongly, would you really turn the other cheek if one of your children was blown to bits by a young impressionable Muslim that had been inspired by that piece of Islamic sh-te, i very much doubt it,|`|YHPYg7pWaa	If there is a suspicion beyond all reasonable doubt that they are a menace and threat to National and International safety.the answer must be;A sentence until it is deemed that they are no longer a threat to public safety.<br>  I would suggest a panel of judges to view each individual case periodically.<br>  The safety of the law abiding individual and the State must overide everything else.|`|c3be98a378a7f478cc0867a107078db7aa	enemy combatants have little in common with civil criminals...the answer is forever until terrorists are defeated.  those who have no regard for civil rights clearly should be treated in like kind.|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	The  problem is civil liberties and  PC and the  European court of human rights.

The trouble is  most of those people  are  wanted  criminals  anyway but cant be  deported  because it would infringe  their  human rights to be sent back to a country that  could  execute them for their crimes.  <br>  <br>  I believe that  if these people  represent a  risk  to the UK and that there  is evidence whether public or  secret of their  miss guided  beliefs plans or deeds - then they should be deported back to where they come from, and if they  are tortured or killed when  sent  back  then so be it. at least it will have  stopped ordinary british people   from being maimed and killed.|`|fiKneZ20aa	This guy is awarded compensation and gets to stay in the country for calling on the deaths of non-Muslims<br>  <br>  Geert Wilders isn't allowed in the country for exposing people who call on the deaths of non-Muslims<br>  <br>  Wow Europe.

Problem is if you are pro life or dont want gay education in kindergartens, the media will shout you down.    Where has there been any credibility on the left?????    Since Roe v. Wade the dems have backed abortion which has murdered 15 million black babies during the last 30 years.  Some how they are the party of the blacks.    Dude the current economic failure is due to democratic creation of fanny mae.  Just go to youtube and search for fanny mae and you can see the dems denying the problem in 2004.    Democrats have been the staunch leaders of people who back the unions.  Our three biggest unions in the US include, Airlines, Public schools and our great auto industry....please tell me how any of those industries are doing.

Especially Keith Olbermann.|`|scw6bBo7aa	You're grouping regular citizens, radio hosts, and politicians together.  As far a leadership goes, we have had several credible voices.

Oh, I forgot...you are a liberal. You probably don't know who any of these people are.    You should try looking up the "credible people" who started and spread the message of your liberal movement.    These people include President Woodrow Wilson, H.G. Wells, Margaret Sanger, and Benito Mussolini.     Oh, but you probably don't know who they are either.     You should find out, though; and what they stood for. Because whether you know it or not, you and other liberals are preaching what they stood for, and carrying on their legacy.    You should at least know what legacy you propagate, and what you are standing for.|`|fa38e842848a4d4d0e66c24701940524aa	You should consider whether your definition of "credible" is skewed by the representation of Conservatism by the media you choose to deem "credible."     My guess is you are neither familiar with the message of Conservatism, nor its proponents, because your chosen media gives you "Joe the Plumber" who merely asked a question, and never intended to be a spokesperson. You probably know nothing at all about Ron Paul, Ronald Reagan, or Barry Goldwater, and I'd bet everything you THINK you know about Sarah Palin is false.     I'd bet your sum total of what you know about Richard Nixon is a single word, "Watergate."     So I guess the answer to your question is "no, none at all" because YOU decide who is "credible," and by definition that's not going to be any Conservative.    *** Dewbran.... "the document that the country still abides by"   What document are you referring to? ;)|`|cLcQKGu3aa	It depends what you define the right as.  A quick glance at the other answers will prove my point.  I see referance to everybody from Truman to a million other people/places/things.    The most convincing message is that the agenda of neo-cons is the original message of conservatives in America.  Convincing because it sounds the same while the whole world has changed.    Grover Cleveland was an early conservative.  But if one would impliment his ideas today, it wouldn't help the same people and it wouldn't hurt the same people.    Think of the word "deregulation."  Sounds like a good ol' conservative cause.  Meanwhile, we now have a global economy.  The same word that used to mean "mom and pop" stores now refers to global companies that don't keep their money in the US, possably don't even employ American workers, and don't have to remain in the US any longer than they feel like.    The public doesn't think long enough to piece these things together.  The politician knows that and uses it.|`|bmCInR5qaa	It would seem not.  Joe, Sarah and Rush seem to have the combined focus and intellectual capacity of a meth addicted shock therapy patient on Haldol.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Eisenhower?|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	I like Thomas Jefferson myself.........he helped write the document that the country still abides by.

Because Classical Liberalism (Jefferson etc)  is EXACTLY what the Republican party should be about.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	We still have credible people. At least they did not have to back out of appointments because they "forgot" to pay their taxes. Somehow I don't think of Al Franken, a failed comedian as a very credible source for the left. ( Or "Bounce your boobies"  Randie Rhodes.)|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	those are cedible people and dont forget Reagan -  that is why you dont like them on the left. The truth is like the pleague to them .

He is a person who is always looking for a fight & a putting people down. So he is always in the same gang as the one you mentioned. McCain got away with so much. He avoided the media than blamed Obama for hogging up the attention but the less we heard from McCain the better he is one of the biggest hypocrites. His mother is an oil heiress & people think he grew up like they did. He spent his whole life disrespecting people. & crashed planes & injured himself & gave away secrets then came back to the senate seat his father bought for him & kept the POWs from coming back. Yet people seem to forget this.& fall for the story that must have been written for him cause he was on tv which I saw clips of him admitting what he did & acting like he was sorry. It is amazing to see the level of integrity that Obama has set for his administration. It will be interesting to see the difference in the 2 parties as he cleans things up but I hope he can get good people who can do the job needed.|`|zj8HLXI3aa	During slavery? Abraham Lincoln?

Sorta sad that it works on 45% of America. Spreading a good message though? never.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	You must be very young and very narrow in your sources of news and commentary.    Just his century, Roosevelt and Reagan are 2 examples of great Presidents. Roosevelt made the world recognize the US as political, economic and military power. He shaped our country with his policies. Everything from Government to national parks and conservation. Reagan brought the USSR to it's knees. Perhaps even a greater threat than Germany and Japan, they could have destroyed us in a day.     But Reagan scared the crap out of them.    Reagan brought us back from an economic sitaution worse than we see today. (Courtesy of Jimmy Carter and a Demoicrat Congress). Reagan bullied the Dem Congress into doing the right thing and it worked. As a result, they have hated him ever since. This is not to say our current financial crisis will not get worse than Carter's, I fully expect it too. But at least we have affordable gas for our cars and interest rates are as low as they can get and unempyment has yet to reach double digits. If you want to compare numbers, research Jimmy Carter and 'Stagflation".     The message is the message. What is credible or not? BIll Clinton is a convicted felon and was disbarred for life. Al Gore is ...what? A nut case. Who else os speading the word for Dems. Nancy Pelosi? Please.. Obama? If his message is the message of the Democrat party, you need to make plans for a new party. Massive spending and off the cuff uninformed decisons dealing with national securtiy are not going to weather very well over the next year. If they keep to this course, we , as a nation, will be unemployed and bankrupt in a year. Democrats have done and are doing NOTHING to increase our own domestic oil production. Last year they were screamng bloody murder but now that oil is down, they are talking about reasearch into possible soulutions thatt will be YEARS away from making a difference. If oil spikes again this summer, they are going to be caught flat footed and we will be standing in line for gas.|`|hnNyUuDQaa	Teddy Roosevelt|`|XqS5DxR9aa	Do ya remember Harry Truman?|`|9gtl24WLaa	noo

The liberals will see the error of their ways as elderly, and wonder why their country is so mean, when they voted for a perfect place, they will wonder what happened.|`|qGrf8csCaa	No, well, I'm not an Obamabot. But you sound like the guy need, I'm trying to put a movie together called "Obama : The Bigger Bulls it Story" It's a reality story, First Obama is born in Kenya in a small hut, then we go into detail on how his father was probably the most corrupt and violent political figure Kenya has ever had. Then we find out about his good ol' cousin Raila Odinga who ordered the mass murder of thousands of people, he was advised in January 2008 by Obama. Then we will discuss how Obama smoked Marijuana. Then we will talk about his genius plan to double capital gains tax, scaring stock buyers and home sellers. Then dividends tax which will, again scare stock buyers and traders. Finally, we finish off with higher income tax and estate tax. Estate tax will be deadly to farmers, because their sons (who will inherit the farm) must pay 55% of the properties worth in order to own it.  And we will end up in worse condition, and no, it's not all Bush's fault. It's really caused by the middle-lower class taking mortgages they can't payback, also it's because they are spending more than they make which hurts credit card companies. This in turn will make people stop buying goods like clothing or electronics and other items, hence hurting the retail business and hurting the industries like GM, Ford or Chrysler.

Bush supporters were not allowed any room to move away from him either. They were bashed and bombarded constantly. It makes most people feel defensive so in order to defend their self, they resort to defending the corrupt "leader" as well. It's a form of denial. My suggestion is for Americans to get off each others backs and start focusing on the government. There are Democrats speaking against Obama, without the bombardment from the "I told you so" crowd, there would be more. But then, I am basing this on the real desire to stop the downward spiral, and not playing a team sport refereed by the government.    I mean, look at the people here defending the indefensible to get my point.    >>edit: maybe all that matters now is that third party, and even fourth party, to bring all the players back down to reality. More and more people are sick of the divide and conquer game and find political tribes to add to the distraction.|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	I much prefer tossing out money for Nation Building when the Nation being built (re-built) is America.

I, for one, oppose them while our national debt is so very high.   Many conservatives recognize that the problem with our nation lies in the banking system, and that a real solution to our economic woes requires fixing that system.   Banks with toxic debt levels will not lend again until they have greater liquidity.   Banks burned by bad debt will be too cautious until they have greater reserves.    However, instead of solving these problems, Obama's is taking all of the money we could hope to have left and wasting it.

Now that you have thoroughly bollixed this up, get an attorney in Canada to take care of getting your son Canadian citizenship, Canadian passport, etc.  The child can only enter/exit the US on the US passport (never let it expire!

As for the marriage/divorce issue, a letter from your estranged husband is not enough and you should not be travelling across state lines, international borders, etc, without proper custody, etc, or you can be charged with absconding with the child.  This "letter" is not a legally enforceable custody agreement.  Therefore you will also need an attorney to handle the divorce, property settlement, custody, and child support issues: be sure that you have legal permission of the court to remove the child from the court's jurisdiction and proper visitation arrangements with the child's father, or else a court order of sole custody and no visitation.|`|GFOdY3nBaa	how does your son can get a canadian citizenship??? are you marrying again??? really, you are illegal in both Canada and America, so i cant see how your son can get canadian citizenship....  you will have to go to your home country, and your son can come back to us whenever he turns 18.

DY9NOh4taa	I think that all politicians who are going to be running for any office where they will be receiving a paycheck for their duties,should have a complete background check from the time they were 18 forward.  Most background checks can be done in a day or two, while others can take up to a week and longer.  Many of the staffers on Bill Clinton's staff were aggravated, because of the FBI background checks on them, and many of his staffers, held onto the form they were required to fill out until they were forced to turn them in.  These checks should be done prior to the individual actually going to work for the government, they should have any access to their job blocked, and not permitted on the premises until the background check is finished and it is established that the individual has nothing derogatory in their background.  For my line of work, companies not only conduct background checks, before hiring me, they also conduct a check of Interpol, before I am formally offered the position.

Should be done before nomination is announced.  Tax evader Tom Daschle is a serial dodger.  In addition to all the glitches he has apologized to the Senate Finance Committee for, theres another important episode in his financial history that bears mention.    Daschle has portrayed himself as the most honest person in America, who always intended to pay all the taxes he owes, and who simply made an honest mistake. But history shows that this is not the first time Daschle has dodged taxes.  In 2004, during his failed re-election campaign, it was revealed that Daschle claimed a property-tax homestead exemption for his $1.9 million Washington, D.C. mansion. Daschle had to certify under penalty of perjury that the mansion was his primary residence. Daschle did so, and got the tax exemption, but there was a problem. Daschle had voted in South Dakota, the state he represented, by absentee ballot, listing a South Dakota address as his primary residence. South Dakota primary residency also was a requirement of Daschle running for office. When the homestead issue surfaced, accusations were made that Daschle or someone on his behalf altered the records to make it appear that only Daschles wife has applied for the exemption.  Daschles opponent, now Senator John Thune, made an issue of this tax dodge in the campaign, and Daschle was defeatedHow much did Tom Daschle save on his homestead exemption tax dodge? A measly $288.

You see that they have some white powder on their face.  You suspect cocaine or meth, but you know it could also be powdered sugar.  You rub the powder off of their face and put it in your mouth.  It definitely doesn't taste like sugar and your gums instantly turn numb.  You now have PC to search that person.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	After years on a waiting list, my sister-in-law had the privilege of adopting a baby like the one you describe.  He is now a very healthy, active 12 year old and much loved by his parents and all of us.  They have given him and his sister (also adopted from a different family) a beautiful home in a nice neighborhood and all of the love you can imagine.    There are thousands of parents waiting to adopt an infant.  Some get tired of waiting and go overseas.    You also forgot the part where the mother takes responsibility for herself and tries to get clean by checking in for treatment, going to meetings and also going back to school.    I firmly believe that we all need to be responsible for ourselves.  Not getting help for an addiction is a choice.  Choosing to prostitute rather than going to school is a choice.  Not being sterilized is a choice.    I'm not criticizing your views, I'm only adding a different perspective to them.    I'm absolutely against allowing a minor to make the decision of an abortion without her parents approval.  Sheesh--a minor can't legally get her ears pierced but we'll allow her to make a decision about a medical procedure?    Also, I've known two men whose wives got an abortion without their consent.  They were married at the time and the child was theirs yet they had no say in the matter.  Somehow, that doesn't seem right.    The situation that I can see abortion being okay is when it effects the life of the mother.  I cannot carry a child to term.  I've had two miscarriages in the last four years.  If a pregnancy were to make it to the fifth month and started to miscarry but didn't and I was hemorrhaging, I would be okay with an abortion (this has never happened to me).    Still, the only time when I really get disgusted with abortion is when it's optional and in the last trimester.  If a woman can't decide by the last trimester, too bad.  Many times a fetus can live outside the womb if born in the 3rd.    If that woman doesn't want that baby, I'd take it.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I think it's very sad when abortions are necessary and I think that people are careless and there shouldn't be the need for so many.  I am not part og the pro-life group though because it is sometimes better that a child is not born.  I would reduce the time limit for abortions though.|`|5W2rEsvFaa	Unless the baby is seriously disabled with no chance of having any quality of life and would be suffering, other than extremities like that it is purely Murder simple as!!|`|AA12020119	Personally I am against it. Morally I am against telling another person, who's shoes I do not have to walk in, that their opinion does not count!    I am especially against it today when those who are anti-abortion believe life begins at conception and ends at birth, which coincides with the time they start criticising them for having children and needing help!|`|bELqEsdOaa	Personally, I am not against or for abortion. I am pro choice. I am for the choice of the woman. Although I think the government's laws should regulate it a little bit so any 'loose girl' can't just get an abortion because she 'got drunk again'. I think if the woman is put in a situation where the baby would be delivered into a violent or deadly situation or if the baby would give chance that the mother would have serious or deadly side effects from giving birth. I don't believe the government should have full power of a woman's body. Many religions will disagree with abortion because "it's not what God would want". My views say that although he wouldn't want it, he wouldn't want a person to die. It should be up to the women if they are responsible for it. Nobody else should have a say. If you don't like abortion, don't have the procedure done. Don't control everyone.|`|OiAl6w48aa	My personal view can be summed up as this: "work to take away the need for abortion, but leave the choice."  I don't agree with abortion, but I certainly don't think that option should be taken off the table because we can't all agree on whether it is right or not.  And in the absence of other evidence, I will always believe that the government should be LESS involved in people's lives.|`|RNNdRHrMaa	There is a medical side to this question.   A baby who has grown in the womb as the mother regularly took drugs, will when born, have to go through withdrawal.    This is a VERY nasty and painful process for the baby.     In those circumstances, where the mother has lost all dignity for herself, and has no respect for herself, how can she responsibly bring a child into the world and raise it to aim for bigger and better things?    Motherhood is an experience where you are supposed to instill morals and values into your child. How can a woman do that, when she has none herself.    As for the abortion issue, I would say no for this one, as once the baby has gone through withdrawal, they usually go on to lead happy and healthy lives. Why deprive the baby of that, with another family, who would treasure the little life.    As for my opinion in abortion in general, I don't agree with the methods of abortion (as they are/can be barbaric, why can they not aneasthestise the feotus before abortions?) but in certain circumstances, they are a must. Medical reasons for the health of both child and mother, rape and incest, etc (I know, there are people out there who say adopt, HYPOTHETICALLY could you make your 11 yr old daughter push your grandchild out, when its your parter's? That would screw anyone up at any age)  I do not believe that is is a convenient way to control the way your life is going. Things happen for a reason. Women who use abortion as a contraceptive, need their heads read.|`|e56910f2ad53133d7636c4d5fc45459aaa	A lot depends on the mother's view. That is not to place the onus on her, but it is her body first and foremost. Having said that I believe where modern medicine has indicated possible birth defects or conjoined infants and it is the medical view that an abortion would be appropriate  to prevent suffering then I would agree. We have seen in Britain an 18 year old last year that decided against doctor's advise to go ahead with a conjoined pregnancy. The doctor's managed to separate the babies after birth, but both later died. So how much did they suffer until they died? Hopefully not too much. The decision to abort is always difficult but surely a baby should always be wanted and has a right to be loved. If these important values cannot be met then why have the child.|`|8zelZj3Aaa	This scenario probably happens more then we suspect, but in any event the child would most likely be taken from the women soon after birth and introduced into foster care. No one would want the child to experience this but many have suffered through adversity such as this, and with help from God and God fearing foster parents, they have become very productive and have led self sustaining and fulfilling lives. Abortion is not the answer.|`|fxdOmoCqaa	Pro-life tends to fall on its own back, just think about miscarriage and if that is murder?|`|AA11101968	I don't like them, but I don't like people telling a woman what she can and can't do with her body even more.|`|dpHxWLwEaa	Its a very hard one to have a clear cut opinion on.  I agree that being a child of someone with a hard drug habit like above does defnitely mean a life of hardship for the child, so i would often agree with it in such circumstances.  But i am not God so its hard to say. My opinion is anyone can get caught with an accidental pregnancy ONCE and i can imagine how dreadfully scary that must be.  I do not judge any woman who does it.  However I do feel it should not be used as a method of contraception, and it should be carried out as soon as the woman knows shes pregant, like within 4/5 weeks, as soon as its possible to detect if you are pregnant.  Views can be varied, i ultimately believe each case is individual and I have to say it must be one of the most diffiuclt decisions any woman has to make so they should never be judged.|`|rftEZA50aa	I agree with you but my conscience doesn't. It's hard for anyone to say unless their in an awful situation. People may say, there are many who want to adopt, if this were true, there wouldn't be so many children in care with difficulty of placing them even though the difficulty of placement can be for a variety of reasons. I worked in a kids home and have seen the deverstation of children with no familes. I think it's ok if the person was raped, or the child severley disabled, not like some who do it because it goes against their holiday plans. On a christian level, no abortions should be allowed as life is not ours to take. I struggle with that though as some abortions seem justified.|`|MHj1lFgOaa	Abortion=murder|`|C3p0MazWaa	i think that if the person is stupid enough to get pregnant then they should take the consequences of have a kid.|`|8dhe15MUaa	it wrong can not say no more on here|`|kzbEWqgLaa	I say that I have no say in whatever a woman wants to do with her body....

I know that i personally wouldn't want my girlfriend to get an abortion because she's pregnant, but that doesnt' mean i have the right to tell someone they can't do what they want     I agree that people don't understand all sides to a story... If a girl got raped by like her father, they expect her to keep that child... Adoption isn't always good either because the child wiill end up in foster home to foster home and there's alot of bad things that happen in foster  homes as well... And all the people that are pro-life are quick to say adoption, but none of them even adopt the kids so...|`|o2c01JsUaa	So a prostitute who sales her body to get drugs is not responsible for her actions Than who is?

If right wingers actually applied their critical thinking skills, Democrats wouldn't feel they need to bring back the Fairness Doctrine.|`|rkRIYxi2aa	People at the political extremes who can't think for themselves generally have a set of convenient and over-simplified myths with which to bash the other side.  In this particular case there is plenty of blame to go around;  the mortgage brokers, the credit agencies, financial services management, regulators all played their part in creating the mess.  Personally I lay most blame on the managements of the lending and insuring companies - no matter what the regulations say, running risks you don't understand is negligence.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	because that isn't how it was used.. that is simply what it says...<br>  <br>  try looking into the history of banks and lending institutions that were sued for not moving fast enough on increasing minority ownership and you might have a much better clue of what is going on... but then again.. you actually believe clinton  which means your not really open to the truth.|`|TV5ajjPZaa	Because its so much fun watching Bubba shake his finger and deny it:  "Now you listen to me..........I did not sign my name on that legislation!"|`|djQ6UyzIaa	Devil is exactly right!|`|TAYErNRkaa	Your quoting sub parts to the regulations written in the manual, and not accounting for the on the fly packaging that the lenders were encouraged to do, in an aggressive attempt to fill their greed sacks to the hilt. It wasn't the Clinton's, Reagan's, or the Bush's alone that led us down the path of economic darkness. It was the sum total of them all, and everyone around them that had their ear and their confidence. No bank or lending institution worth their salt should advertise zero down, no payment for a year loans, tuck them neatly into an ARM, and sit back to await payment, without expecting the sown seeds to revisit them.

G4TJ8nibaa	Ignore ibu guru! India doesn't allow dual citizenship. The child would have to give up her US citizenship in order to become an Indian citizen which I assume neither she nor her mother wants! If the mother relinquishes custody to you then it is not a problem!   Many Mexicans leave their children in the US and then cry about the "horrible US government breaking up their family!"

If the mother abandons her child in the US, child welfare authorities can take the child and terminate parental rights.      Under no circumstances "take in" someone else's minor child.

966c91231592132e98c766b9abba712eaa	I recommend sexual procreation.  <br>    <br>  I am not sure how to incentivise what is already a <br>  pleasurable activity.<br>  <br>  Do not count on any government to help with the <br>  birthrate.  When governments do that  to the citizenry, <br>  it is rarely satisfying  or productive.  <br>    <br>  Declining birthrates are customary in developed nations.  <br>    <br>  A cultural shift is more effective than any government <br>  program.  While procreation is quite pleasurable, raising <br>  children is a very demanding, and yet potentially rewarding <br>  experience.<br>    <br>  Celebrate new life and all the nurturing and develop <br>  activities, perhaps even more than travel, leisure and <br>  consumption activities.   This is best effected in a small, close communities.  <br>    <br>  Reduce the financial and time costs associated raising <br>  children the parents pay.  Government actually can provide <br>  incentives for these in terms of subsidies and bonuses.  <br>  But it seems to me that enhancing community bonds <br>  so that local options for treasuring the value of children <br>  could be most efective, possibly with government financial <br>  and intellectual support.<br>    <br>  I still favor local solutions in the form of procreation.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	In parts of Europe, Muslims are multiplying like rabbits.|`|DQT5ZDSPaa	Freak states of America?

Each nation in Europe (and elsewhere) must recognize that their culture and ethnicity are at risk of being destroyed.  Reducing immigration would be the first priority.  <br>  <br>  Culture is important to people and it cannot be substituted without erosion to the very soul of a people.  Language is important.  A nation's values are reflected in their language and customs.  Language is important in law and trade. <br>  <br>  <br>  Encourage the value of work.  Often people over time get the notion that some types of work are beneath their doing, so they encourage other "inferiors" to do such work.  We need to respect workers --- Even G-D worked, and he saw it was Good.    So, since we are not G-D, we should encourage work and teach people how to respect workers.<br>  <br>  Appeals to Greed.

gZtanQ7Taa	Definitely; It is written! <br>  <br>  "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places" (Matthew 24:7)<br>  <br>  All these things have already swung into motion and the stage is set. If we all look around carefully and open our eyes we will notice that all these things that are mentioned in the Bible are actually happening right now. <br>  <br>  1. (The current global recession):<br>  <br>  Have the people in the appropriate positions in power done anything to remedy this? <br>  <br>  The answer is no! Instead, they are throwing more fuel into the fire deliberately, by making decisions that will put us further and further into a global economic recession. <br>  <br>  Why do they want to do this? <br>  <br>  To bring about the final goal of a one world government and eventually a one world form of currency, or as they themselves regularly refer to this as a 'New World Order'. Think about it, why would the people accept a 'New World Order' unless they thought this was the only way forward out of this difficult period. So; they will add fuel to the fire until us (the people) will accept anything.<br>  <br>  Back to the subject (World War 3)!<br>   <br>  This event has been planned by certain powerful people in high places around the world a long time ago. It will begin in the middle east between Israel and the Arab nations as predicted in the Bible and you will NOT have to wait 10 years to see it happen; (This is also already falling into place). <br>  Now that Netanyahu is in power it is no longer a matter of 'WHEN' but rather a matter of 'HOW SOON'. It will be the worst war we have ever witnessed with a MAJOR loss of human life and has been planned for a reason, which we need not talk about here. <br>  <br>  For anyone that doubts bible prophecy. Well, So far about 450 prophecies in the bible have come about with an unblemished accuracy of 100%. Basically around 85% of the prophecies in the Bible have been fulfilled with the most notable of all of them the re-establishment of the nation of Israel. <br>  <br>  Why was this the most notable one of all?<br>  <br>  Because roughly 2500 years earlier from this event in 537 BC (Now hold your seats because this is truly amazing) we were given the exact amount of time (going by the Jewish calendar which was in effect those days -360 days/year)- that this prophecy would be fulfilled; <br>  <br>  It was fulfilled to the exact specified date 907200 days later, which guess what; gives you May 15th, 1948! Just predicting the exact year 1948 would have been against all odds let alone the exact amount of days.<br>  <br>  **My dear friends; all the answers to your questions are in the Bible. Go and get one while you still have a chance. Because I am sure they will be banned soon.

alpDOHtkaa	The Israeli government refuses to officially confirm or deny whether it has a nuclear weapon program. However, it is widely believed that they do possess a small arsenal of nuclear weapons. If they do, it is reasonable to assume that their policy on the use of such weapons is the same as the United States' and Britain's: no first strike option.  This means they would not use a weapon of mass destruction unless one was used against them. If they were to initiate a nuclear strike they know they would lose the much-needed political and financial support that they receive from the West.|`|CM23jSEmaa	they do indeed have nukes, and I dread to think what they will do with them. the second half of the question I do not wish to think about, nuclear war is not an idea I am fond of|`|AuKKjaxaaa	The day Iran has one you can bet they will drop it on Israel.

It has been their policy to not answer the question.    I don't think they are anywhere near the end of their patience with the the hostile countries that surround them.

I don't understand that because to say so is to make a child indistinguishable from a baby chick and many mammals, since they all develop in a similar fashion.  I don't understand how they can distinguish between the fetus being alive and not the zygote that divided to form it.  Or the sperm and egg that formed the zygote.  Or the somatic cells in the body that differentiated into those cells, which is similar throughout the body in the form of stem cells.  I haven't heard a decent line of argumentation from them, and issues with the care of the mother seem to go out the window the moment they discuss a possible child.

While at the same time taking away most of the benefits that would help that life through it's rocky beginnings?    Which girl is most likely to seek an abortion: One that knows she'll get no help with feeding herself or her baby, will get no help on getting a roof over her head and her baby's; will get no help on putting her baby in daycare so she can go study or work to better her life and her baby's, will get no help going back to school so that she can get herself out of the hole and not be a burden anymore.    Or one that knows she'll get all this?    It's in every body's best interest to help these women and their kids because you want these kids to become your next mechanic, doctor, teacher, banker etc. and not your next rober, dealer, rapist or murderer.    People if you are pro-life but do not support universal healthcare you have a serious case of Hypocresy and "having your cake and eating it too".    WHY should it be the role of the government to force people to have children they don't want , why should the government forbid abortion and then on the other hand it should NOT be the government's role to at least help support the life they forced someone to bring.

Last time I checked, and I am currently in my obstetrics clincal for nursing school, fetal development happens a bit differently than what you describe.     At just 18 days the heart begins to beat. And after just 21 days the baby pumps its own blood through a separate closed circulatory system with even its own blood type. Now if you are so smart, tell me how you could still be considered living right now, if you didn't have your heart circulating blood to your organs? Impossible, you'd die. After 28 days the eyes, ears, and respiratory system begin to form. 42 days in to development brain waves can be recorded and the baby begins to have its own reflexes present. Nerves are still in development, it may not feel your defintion of "pain" but it feels and reacts just like you and I. And finally at just 8 weeks in the womb, the baby has begun development of every system that a human needs to live. The genital organs can be clearly differentiated at 16 weeks. The important thing to realize though is that at conception (fertilization of the egg), the genetic makeup is complete, even the sex is determined.    Ignorance is bliss. Until you realize you are actually wrong. You can't argue about abortion when you make points that aren't even true. Please email me when you read up some more on this and we can debate further. But until then you shouldn't waste our time on here because you are obviously misinformed.|`|9RgjqTeuaa	At one month the heart is already beating and yes.. he or she can feel pain.|`|0ee4bfdaab9564dc9d539b29997544ecaa	You are sick.

A human being is a living organism that has the human genetic code, pure and simple.

( It apparently has more of a soul than you do.) And gender is indeed already determined, even if you can't see that either.|`|5syj6Uzaaa	Here is the picture along with the text that goes with it [1].  For people unwilling to go to the site:    "By four weeks, the embryo has a head, tail, backbone and limb buds - which will eventually become arms and legs. The beginnings of ears and eyes are also visible. Its heart is already beating, and the other organs are forming fast. An umbilical cord starts to grow between the embryo and the placenta. During this time, the embryo is especially sensitive to any drugs or infections capable of crossing the placenta from the mother."    Now, I lean toward pro-choice, and I do differentiate the creature in the picture from a fully grown human.  I understand that there is a spectrum from killing a microbe that makes you sick (almost universally accepted as a good thing to do) to killing a fetus (morality debated) to killing a grown human (almost universally condemned as wrong - assuming it's not in self-defense, punishment for crime, etc).    The reason why I draw attention to the text accompanying your photo is that I want to debate based upon facts.  I see dishonesty and error (which I'm willing to grant that your omission probably was) from both sides.  I think that we can get on much better if we tell things like they are.    Your comments to Galaxie girl contained some inaccuracies.  The creature does have a heart (which is already beating).  Other organs are forming fast though we don't know (from the text) if one of them is a brain.  It has the "beginnings of eyes".  It doesn't look like it has a nose.    Is it alive?  You're not going to make much headway with anti-abortion people with that argument.  Of course, it's alive.  What's more, it has the potential to be a grown human.  By making this "it's not alive" argument, you beg the question, "when does it become alive?"  What is the arbitrary line between when it is a non-living "thing" and when it is a living human worthy of rights?  Is it birth?  Is it sooner?  Later?  Do you support infanticide?    All of these questions would be fair retorts from people who do not accept abortion.  And relying upon your reasoning here, you have no answer.  But like I wrote above, I lean toward pro-choice.  My rationale lies strictly in the right of a woman to control what is within her body.  I value human life and commend any woman who goes on with an unwanted pregnancy, but I do not favor forcing any woman to do so.

They are equally deserving of employment, housing, medical care, and others, and those who attempt to deny such things should be prosecuted.<br>  As far as homosexual marriage, being against it is not being against rights; it is being against a granting of extended rights that have no benefit to society.  Laws allowing homosexual marriage potentially create a Constitutional Crisis, as those who favor its implementation cloak themselves in the Fourteenth Amendment, while those opposed cite the special protections granted to religion under the First Amendment.  Already, religion has been forced to give in to the state where certain regulations are mandated to equal protection (a Catholic Charities Adoption agency in Massachusetts closed rather than potentially face a lawsuit denying homosexual couples adoption privileges).  This is the beginning of religious persecution, which our Founding Fathers attempted to negate FIRST before anything else in the Bill of Rights, and thus, the road to tyranny, especially by an uber-minority.|`|6380221dbceb0381d89b54bd786e9f42aa	They want special rights that is all.

jd14u32qaa	Authority is a more legal term.  Someone in a position of authority has been placed in charge of 'the rules'.  It's their job to enforce whatever rules exist in their little domain.  A security gaurd, for example.  Power is a more general term.  Someone with authority certainly has power, but you can have power by itself as well.  A mob boss is a person of power.

On occasion the subject of racism comes up-usually it is an accusation that a co worker is racist. In some instances the accusation had some validity, but usually it was a misunderstanding.  Different cultures place different meaning to words and someone who looks for racism will usually find it even when it is not there.  I have worked with native americans, asians and blacks who felt they were made to do more work than whites. It was not true but in most instances they stuck fast to that idea.  They had an expectation that they would be made to do more work, and felt they were. Many times they actually did less work. As far as engaging someone in a conversation about race, it usually only occurs when a problem arises, unless there is a curious question about cultural customs. In most instances, the different races seem to enjoy a discussion about cultural customs or beliefs. Those conversations lead to a greater understanding of each other.|`|WTHTVJN6aa	You, as a white person, speak the truth about race, and minorities and white liberals call you a racist.|`|d9cB8yN8aa	Good luck having one of those.|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	I work in the hospitality industry for an international hotel chain.<br>  <br>  I work directly with people from at least 22 different countries, of all races and religions.<br>  <br>  We do discuss our experiences in our lives, which has lead to discussions of differing perceptions and experiences based on gender, race, religion, sexual orientation and country of origin.  <br>  <br>  But to try to orchestrate such discussions would feel strange and forced.  We have gotten to know each other and have a continuing dialog about everything - business, our families, our lives.

When I was growing up there, there literally would not have been anyone for me to have a racial conversation with, as there were only whites.

They tell "whites" that they should be ashamed of themselves for treating (enter what ever group they are here) badly now and/or in the past.  They complain about how hard it is to be (enter group here) in (enter country, usually America, here).  That's what a so-called racial dialogue is.  If you don't belong to the group, they don't want to even hear from you because they assume you're a racist, especially if you are "white".<br>  <br>  If they did actually want to listen to someone who might represent a "non-minority" (I am a minority in certain parts of the town I live in), I'd say something like this:  I am not white.  A piece of paper is white.  Marshmallows are white.  I have a heritage and a cultural background that is every bit as interesting and important to me as any so-called "minority" person has.  Do not assume I'm a racist just because I have lighter colored skin than you do.  I don't dislike anyone based on what they look like.  <br>  <br>  The way I see it, the way we are born is not our fault and no one should be treated differently based solely on what they look like.  What I do have a problem with is the attitude of certian people.  A person's attitude, outlook on life, way they treat other people is their fault; they are not born thinking that way.  A person cannot change the way they look but they can change what they think and how they act.  <br>  <br>  I have many friends who don't look at all like me, but we do share certain beliefs and respectfully disagree about the things we don't share an opinion on.  The only people I dislike are the ones who have beliefs or ideas that I am totally against and cannot possibly agree with; especially those who try to make me accept or show respect for those beliefs.  <br>  <br>  One quick example is the pro-abortion activist.  I don't care what the person looks like.  They could look as much like me as is humanly possible without being my twin and I'd still dislike them intensly, especially if they pushed their horrible agenda on me.  I will never agree nor respect the views of someone who ignores the rights of the innocent unborn.<br>  <br>  Anyway, that's a bit of the "racial dialogue" I'd have with someone of some "minority" group if they actually cared to listen to me.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	You don't walk up to strangers....that was his whole point. That we work with and live next to people who are different from ourselves, but never actuall get to know them personally. While this isn't true in every case, in most areas of the country, black and white people live and work side by side, yet never spend time together outside of the workplace. We say hi, we talk about work, but we don't truly know or understand them. Again, that may not be true for you, but I would have to question why you wouldn't understand what a racial dialogue is if you actually had friends --not coworkers that you claim as black friends--that you regularly dialogued with.
4ErIxkhyaa	I still favor ArcLight. We used it in the DMZ against NVA Divisions, nothing survives. <br>  <br>  We had two missed opportunities. First we could have criminalized Terrorism and had Global support. Next we failed to use decisive immediate action. <br>  <br>  We had several months that Osama was laying back laughing at us. And Bush sent the CIA in to Give $8 Billion dollars to Tribal War Lords. And capture a Hippie kid from California.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile Squadrons of B-52's set idle on Diego Garcia just 1000 Miles away.<br>  <br>  I would have ArcLighted every inch of Waziristan and turned it into a worm food.|`|95gEZ22Caa	The war on terror was over in Tora Bora caves it was not hard to kill BIN LADEN and as for every terrorist in the world THAT'S INSANE to think such a self proclaimed WAR could be REAL & WON.   but Plutocrats make believers out of populations|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Well we would have had to use one of our very old nukes in order not to radiate the whole region.

Operation Iraq Freedom<br>  <br>  And VERY pro-AFGANISTAN war.  Operation Enduring Freedom.<br>  <br>  In case you haven't noticed, there are two very separate wars, with two very different reasons.  One which needs to be ended, and one which needs to be escalated.|`|b32jC7pGaa	Because they are smart enough to remember Obama's campaign pledge.

8cLV2OPYaa	Yes I agree. The more people single out race for negative scrutiny, OR, positive accolades, race will continue to be a divisive factor in our society. No race has a history that is any more or less significant than anyone else's.<br>  <br>  Period.|`|AA10491661	I agree. this crap further divides the races. Im sick of black history month getting shoved down my throat every year.... why no white history month? chinese history month? why the blacks only?  <br>  <br>  I work for the govt and the govt is the biggest promoter of this crap... it makes non blacks feel really out of place in february. causes lots of friction in the workplace. <br>  <br>  blacks have done some great things for america... but they should be commended for it because they are human, americans... and not for any other reason. color needs to be left out of it.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Yea, and there should be no affirmative action either.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Yes. Lets just celebrate American History month how about.|`|AA10036540	I agree with this:  If we remove the Black History month, we may not have the opportunity to infuse Black contributions in society.  Case in point:<br>  Outside of February, when our children are learning about the first space explorers, will we take the time to mention Dr. Mae Johnson, the first African American woman to go into space.  <br>  <br>  Also, I can't speak for other races, but I think there should be time in our calendar set aside for other races throughout the year also.  I know that while my daughter learns about American History and Black history, I would really love her to come home and tell me the contributions other races have made to society as well.|`|yViX0rLxaa	f--k black history month--no one cares anymore--three hundred yrs ago--maybe--but we all know the diatribe--blacks we're suppressed--and now they aren't--now they can act like hoodlums and thugs freely--at the expense of law abiding people--<br>  <br>  now with obama every day is a day with blacks...screwing up our history.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	America is a melting pot nation.  Drawing attention to any one race over another does nothing but perpetuate racism.

It should be banned but have it spread throughout the year.<br>  ----------------<br>  <br>  To Arielle<br>  <br>  Nobody cares about the other races. The world is really Black & White. Plus, other races are not a vocal about racism, they....suffer in silence.|`|yJ31VS79aa	In a way I do. <br>  It would make more sense if other nationalities had their own months too. It kinda seems like we are singling them out.|`|6qyrhgjwaa	If every month includes White History.  I'm for it.|`|YkseyT7zaa	I believe that History is all history as it doesn't need any additional discriptive word before it.<br>  Rights should be rights for all and not specific to any group. ie. marriage for those that want to get married not just for those that read a certain book.<br>  Remove the labels. Enjoy and respect everyone's culture. You'd be surprise how alike we really are
AA11163314	Of course they do.<br>  <br>  Look at their desire to censor talk radio with the 'fairness doctrine.' <br>  <br>  And notice how any criticism of them is labeled 'hate speech' or 'racism.'|`|q4EXFhV7aa	No. Remember, it was YOUR party that called people who disagreed with Bush 'unpatriotic'.  Dissent is very patriotic. I'm fine with it.|`|InmEJDcSaa	They have always been this way, once they get in power they become conservatives, think about it, when liberals are in opposition they are the champion of all causes but once they get in power they become super conservative, they look out only for each other and don't want anyone to oppose them.|`|zjpB2GARaa	Of course they do.  They may posture as the "party of tolerance" but that is as much a sham as the claim by the Republican Party to be the "party of small government" was during the Bush years.|`|AA12212403	I don't know if they want to make it illegal, but they can dish it out but can't take it.<br>  Look at what a good sport Sarah Palin was by going on SNL that time.

AA11482024	Tough question.  I'll have to go with the Democratic party appearing more self-righteous.  While both act as if they have the only solutions for the problems at hand and think the other party must be idiots, the Democrats won the tip of the scale for the constant accusations of anyone not agreeing with them being uneducated, redneck or racist.<br>  <br>  I'm conservative, but I'm starting to not favor any party.  I supposed I lean toward Libertarian.  I tried to make a fair evaluation of your question but it's hard to rule out personal bias.|`|isbGvDRZaa	I would say any party that has opposed the Republicans appears right, since they have been proven so consistently wrong.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	I hate both parties so I'm good on this one.<br>  Both parties are idiots and do that but.. if I had to pick one it would be democratic party because it seems that they follow their politicians closer than the reps do. They are bigger fans of their own leaders one might say. And that of course goes to the politician's head.|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	when you stated we're right, you got it right. The right by far seems holier than thou. I do not subscribe to any political party.
J70iEDBhaa	They all lie in their campaigns. Come on, do you really think they even read the speeches before they say them? I doubt it. Bush couldnt even speak half the time. No, Obama is full of crap. Hes just another CFR puppet and he makes me sick. People will realize that hes a crook soon enough. He has already taken back campaign promises stating that "the problems with the economy is going to make me cut back on what I promised in my campaign. We all must understand that sacrifices must be made for the better good of America."  aka... "Your all a bunch of suckers!  Ill do whatever I want now that Im president and theres nothing you can do about it!"   I hope people start paying attention<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sj91NH5fvw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sj91NH5f...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I have asked myself the same question.. but Its just something your going to have to accept. Ive been a political activist for a long time and people really just dont want to know the truth. They fear it. The majority of the population prefers to be led. They have given up resonsibility of their own lives for simplicity. They have traded their rights for a false sense of security. Youve seen how people act on here. If they havent seen things with their own eyes or they have never heard of it before then its instantly untrue. People are nieve. Ive mostly given up hope of it ever getting better.
iDiAiWRhaa	I agree. It is Asinine to have to tiptoe around him because he's black. As far as I'm concerned, he's no better then any other President it comes to this. Plus, I think this cartoon was "read into" too much. People seeing only what they want to see. What went on over this is BS!!|`|ygGr1nX7aa	If it's the one I'm thinking of, then it was a pretty crappy cartoon.  There's a line between 'funny' and 'brutal' and depicting someone realistically as a primate that's been shot is quite a long way over that line- it amounts to an overt personal attack.  There wasn't really any trace of irony or lightness that I could tell, just a broken, dehumanised corpse.  Over an *economic issue*, no less.  Humour and mockery are fine, but if they're just going to print hateful material, they deserve to be called on it.<br>  <br>  Bush got ridiculed regularly, but no-one with a reputation to lose suggested he was a sub-human who deserved death.<br>  <br>  Of course, there's the ambiguity of whether it WAS about Obama, but the fact that it's ambiguous is still the artist's fault (and that of whoever ran it)- at best it just downgrades the problem from 'hate' to 'severe case of foot in mouth'.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	I find it a stretch, an oversensitive reaction, that people think the cartoon is racist.  I interpret the cartoon as saying the stimulus bill is a mess and must have been written by an idiot, a clown, and just happened to use the chimp from elsewhere in the news as a foil.  the chimp was never intended to represent Obama, from the way I see it.<br>  <br>  But because monkeys have been used portray blacks with racist intent, people have over-reacted on this one, in my view.<br>  <br>  If it had been a clown instead of the chimp, there would be no outrage (unless the clown was in blackface, which WOULD have been racist).<br>  <br>  So I tend to agree with your view.|`|0odpCqUGaa	obama is so insecure and deeply troubled about his colour--he can't laugh at anything--even remotely--<br>  <br>  If I were editor, I would not apologize..especially after the papers were allowed to run--Bush doing any and everything..<br>  <br>  I really am beginning to hate o-no-man--and his f--king circus of zealots!<br>  <br>  I say if the shoe fits--obama--maybe we'll throw at your head! Why didn't o--mind all the cartoons showing Bush being assaulted?|`|ZXr8BSRyaa	The cartoon wasn't even about him, shows me that there are too many race hustlers.  Maybe that new Atty general POS can understand now why we tiptoe around race.  to many violent ghetto rats willing to get indignant over nothing.|`|9wrMpXRyaa	Because it was blatantly racist.<br>  <br>  Regardless who wrote the package, Obama gets the blame/credit.  I don't give a rats behind what partisans say, that cartoon even a 6 year old could see it was racist.<br>  <br>  Thumbs down me for all I care, when I saw it I knew there was going to be hell to pay, and well deserved at that.|`|Ocyrox5baa	Now you understand the bigotry that non Dems have dealt with for so long.|`|tltloVKpaa	They are afriad they will be looked at as being racist...After all look what our new att. general called all the white people in this country  (cowards )|`|G2szJB3Oaa	Easy, they are afraid of legal repercussions :) and no other reasons.|`|58528550d6d68eb46c65f61a3e8a8578aa	How long will the Emperor's New Clothes last?|`|Nkwv2hygaa	To appease the fascist black supremacists like Sharpton.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Yep.   Very true.  I mean the late night talk show hosts can't even bring themselves to joke on Obama.  It's like they all have to handle him with velvet gloves because they're afraid of offending people.   Sad.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	i wonder that too as they never apologized for cartoons of bush.  but when you have the FIRST black president,,,you need to be "careful".  everyone wants to be fair, everyone wants both sides to get along (be it racial sides, political sides etc) but you can only "make fun" of certain ones.  sometimes people put WAYYY too much thought into a silly cartoon,,,or an off handed remark and turn it into something that is nowhere near the true idea of it|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Which cartoon are you referring to?  If it's the one where the cops shoot the chimp, that cartoon is racist if it indeed was about Obama.  However, if the point of the cartoon is that the stimulus bill was so poorly written it must've been done by a chimp, then it's not about Obama.  Presidents don't write laws; Congress does.|`|HQKuzxulaa	The cartoon was in bad taste. No one had to apologize to Bush because the man was an ***.|`|A7qDWyTYaa	Some one is being a wee bit disingenous.
3916f36babf2260a21d0a9cd8e5a3e64aa	I drive about 28,000 miles a year for work.  It isn't optional.  If Obama taxes me, I will have to pass the cost on to clients, which is exactly what other small business owners will do.  This will be a disaster if implemented, like everything else Obama has come up with so far, and the best thing about it is that I am becoming more and more confident that he is going to be a one-term messiah.<br>  <br>  For the record, we do not have projects in Detroit or the metro area anymore.  They were torn down several years ago.  We don't have public transportation because the auto industry used to be here.  You cannot even hail a cab in Detroit.  You have to call and schedule one.  There is a bus system, but it is unreliable.  You cannot walk or bike to work in Detroit because it's unsafe and not practical or even possible during the winter.  We were going to build a public transit center that went throughout the tri-county area, but that had to be scrapped because we don't have any money.  <br>  <br>  None of this matters, though, because no one has a job anymore.  GM announced it is considering moving its headquarters to Charlotte, NC.  It is being said that Chrysler is not even worth saving.  We don't need cars, houses or jobs in Detroit.  We need mental institutions, drug rehab centers and homeless shelters because people are losing their homes and their minds at an alarming rate.  Yesterday morning we awoke to find a neighborhood woman who has fallen on difficult times nearly frozen to death on our front lawn.  It was 12 degrees here, and who knows how much time she had left.  If people think this is an anomaly, I invite them to please come visit for a week or so.  Waking up to find this dear woman nearly dead on my lawn is something that will never leave me.  Our state is devastated, and it's devastating our citizens.<br>  <br>  The auto companies can make cars as fuel efficient as they want to, but the sad fact is that there will be no one who can buy one anyway.  If taxes get too high, many people who do work will quit working, just like mothers who find that it's cheaper to stay home with their kids than it is to pay for daycare.  Last summer my husband asked me if I wanted to quit working and stay home to raise children, and I laughed.  I'm not laughing now.  Why should I work if Obama is going to take away my living and my ability to help provide for our financial future, which is what I work for anyway?<br>  <br>  It's too late to urge people not to vote for Obama, so all I can do is urge people to pay attention to what their lawmakers are doing and speak up for what is right, ignoring the media and their agenda.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the long answer.

One, truckers who transport our good have to go long distances and the added cost would break them. They are already not doing very well with the increase in the cost of gas. They would most likely pass the cost on the the consumer who would buy less, thus furthering the economic crisis.<br>  Second, it would not reward people who are buying alternative energy cars. <br>  Third, I don't think it should be legal for government to put anything in anyone's property. People should have full legal rights to the things that they own. Next they would be tracking people. <br>  I don't believe in property taxes either, which harms the peoples right to life and liberty.

(although the North Vietnamese could have used the same argument)<br>  <br>  splitting hairs on whether it is torture or not was silly. and that is what the press did, saying that it was just intense "interrogation".<br>  <br>  the press can make or break an issue with the American people.  If you wish to believe that somebody is sitting in their home in a foreign country planning to destroy you, because you are an American, then have fun.  I think people do things for a reason, so maybe our foreign policy needs changing. maybe we should stop trying to export our brand of "democracy" (which ends being a capitalist boon for businesses in the US).<br>  <br>  A policy of continued war against anything that we feel is a threat will keep us at war indefinitely. any and all cultures not American, and can be viewed as a threat.<br>  <br>  finally, President Bush put in place a organization known as the "homeland security" and he spent billions to put it in place, so if he has spent these billions, and it doesn't work, who's fault is it?<br>  <br>  As a final note, for all the warmongers sitting here typing away, if your so concerned, why are you not in uniform fighting for our country?

Be prepared because this tactic is now and always has been a successful motivator of political policy. I suspect Obama will revert to it whenever he thinks he is in doubt of getting whatever he wants.<br>  <br>  slykitty62: Take your own advice.

The facts are we are not in as bad of shape as he wants us to believe.<br>  <br>  In ancient times, our species survived by reacting to threats.  Those who stopped to “smell the roses” were easy targets for predators.  We no longer have those same kinds of threats but we still have the instinct. So we need to look at facts to reassure ourselves.<br>  <br>  1.  Free time - we have more than 5 hours of spare time a day.  That is an hour more than we had in 1965 and 4 hours more than we had in the 19th century when people worked 60 hours a week but only lived to about the age of 50. <br>  <br>  2.  Peace - Much of the 6.5 billion people in the world live in peace.  In earlier generations, up to a quarter of men died in violent circumstances.  In the last century, a person’s chance of dying from violence, including wars, was less than 2 percent.  It is now comparable to the risk of driving a car.<br>  <br>  3.  Housing - In 1950, the typical house was 1,000 sq feet with 2 bedrooms and 1 bath.  Only about half of Americans could afford to own a house.  Today, the average house has 2,200 square feet with 3 bedrooms and 2 baths.  More than 2/3 of Americans own their homes.<br>  <br>  4.  Literacy - In 1970, barely half the world could read.  Now almost 80% can.<br>  <br>  5.  Food- In the 17th and 18th centuries, even royals had limited access to food.  A peasant could expect to eat less than 2,000 calories a day even though they worked at physical labor.  The average person today eats 2,800 calories a day and is more sedentary.  Nations now have obesity as an issue instead of hunger.<br>  <br>  6.  Forest Land - In recent decades America has gained 70 million acres of wilderness since the land is no longer needed for crops. <br>  <br>  7.  Cars - Compared to 1970, cars burn less gasoline and emit 98% less pollutants.<br>  <br>  8.  Warheads - During the Cold War, the US and Russia had about 50,000 warheads aimed at each other.  Now we have gotten rid of about 90% of those.  In years to come, this will be looked upon as an amazing feat but right now we don’t even pay much attention to it.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	He will go down in history as the Secretary for North American Affairs under the global government he is working so hard to implement.

But these people genuinely believed that they'd be able to pay their mortgage - how were they to know that the economy was going to hell. All of us that KNEW this was coming must have made millions short selling banks, right?<br>      <br>      The mortgage problems are reaching more people all the time, it's not just sub prime loans anymore.  People receiving assistance should pay for it, by paying for their house longer. Banks benefiting from having these loans assisted will get a "haircut"- principle reduction, probably big ones.<br>  <br>      As much as I dislike the stimulus spending, and having dems in charge of anything, I have to agree that keeping people in their homes, and keeping banks solvent enough to perform their function is crucial, and the best thing that can be done at this juncture.
27sSI5wxaa	You are so right.<br>  <br>  I didn't hear McCain talking about "generational theft" when Bush doubled the deficit.<br>  <br>  I didn't hear the  other Republicans talking about our kids paying down the deficit when Bush gave the top 1% richest Americans tax cuts, which helped to increase the deficit.<br>  <br>  I didn't hear the Republicans complaining when the Bush spent over $100 million dollars to increase Iraq's economy while they sat on over $86 million dollars.<br>  <br>  When he spent the surplus, it was used to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.  And you're right again.  Bush had nothing to show for it.

When it's not your money, it's easier to spend.<br>  And it's easy to forget the reality of 9-11 and how we all screamed for justice. But that costs money, and at that point, both parties were willing to pay the cost. Then came along Iraq. Some feel they were lied to, and that Bush just wanted to make war, and gain control of foreign oil,under the guise of looking for WMD's. But his itinerary was Saddam, who was a weapon of mass destruction. Cha-ching. Taking out his sons...Cha-ching. Stabilizing the region and fighting for control of major cities, trying to cut off the supply of weapons to the taliban...cha-ching.Money Money Money Money....and yet, still not as much as Obama is trying to throw into this stimulus package.|`|NZuJR79oaa	Ive been speaking out against it since he first started deficit spending.  Its grossly irresponsible and no president should do it.<br>  <br>  Also, Obama has spent a trillion dollars of deficit spending in his first month.  That's at a much quicker rate than Bush.|`|bkav003oaa	Because now the GOP is in the minority and figures the only way to get back into power is to get people angry at the Democrats and vote for them. <br>  <br>  The GOP still has not figured out how to get people to vote FOR them, not AGAINST the other party.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Bush did not veto Congressional bills with some pork, but the quantity was moderate, as were the budget deficits during the Bush presidency.  Obama is a horse of a different color.|`|ldDDqCJSaa	The repugs are SEETHING with jealousy because Obama is fixing their screw up and doing it quickly.|`|PtHThRoNaa	You didn't go back far enough.  This all started with Reaganomics.|`|DypTl9Zdaa	There's really not an inconsistency if you consider that Bush had some tough choices to make during his 8 terms.  Obama is pushing his agenda on us in his first month and has by far surpassed anything that Bush did.  This stimulus bill is only the tip of the iceberg for spending so we all really need to hold on to our seats.  Really, one must consider that for 6 years of Bush's term the economy was doing really well.  People really do think that all the problems occurring at the end of his term were his fault but that's not logic.  Congress had more to do with the downfall than Bush did after the people voted in a Democratic Congress.  The Carter and Clinton programs came back to bite us in the butt as well.  Sometimes it takes a long time for us to see an administration affect us and for the most part Bush didn't create the mess we are in.  Obama on the other hand has managed to create this mass exodus of people who believed him when he blamed Bush (he never really gave good reasons I might add) so now that he's in office Obama is going to keep those believers behind a mask of denial and confusion until he's managed to turn this country into an asylum of nothing but social programs and dependency.|`|jEqISBnQaa	Oh, but it WAS; the Dems cried and screamed about it continuously.<br>  <br>  Now that THEY'RE in power, however, they're dead silent on the subject.<br>  <br>  Funny how that works, huh? Well, maybe not so funny after all, is it?|`|AA11424005	I think your helmet is too tight.  It is cutting off blood supply to the brain.  All spending bills have to originate in the House of Representatives.  So the majority in the House, when a bill is passed, has the first and most guilt.<br>  <br>  Running up deficits was an issue with me and other conservatives.  We railed against it for years.  Republicans and Democrats alike were guilty of wasteful spending.<br>  <br>  Clinton never left a "surplus."  He projected a surplus and cooked the books that he left for Bush.  It was one of Clinton's many lies.<br>  <br>  I am opposed to Obama's spending because he engineered it.  It is wasteful.  Obama is pursuing a socialist agenda.  You will find me railing against this sort of behavior as long as it goes on.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Because the people screaming are Republicans, and they are more effective at getting their message out.  Even if they have to bend, twist and omit things to get people roused.<br>  When Dems complained about the war costs being put off for generations Reps got all sanctimonious about 'protecting our country'.<br>  They got away with it, but that debt remains.<br>  Reps like to talk a lot about a liberal media bias, they like it so much that shows feel compelled to put on the endless unknown senators from small states who now have become the fiscal conservatives they weren't when the their party held power.<br>  <br>  This isn't actually Obamas agenda, a year ago he had an agenda that didn't include any of this, the times changed and the results of years of trickle down has put him in a position of having to scramble to mitigate the changing circumstances.<br>  McCain would have been in the same positions, if he had recognized the financial dangers we are in, he would have had to take measures to soften our landing.  If not, we would be in worse shape for longer.  And we still aren't within sight of its ending.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	There was no Clinton "surplus" GOD I GET TIRED OF HEARING THAT.<br>  <br>  The national debt was 1.6 TRILLION HIGHER the day Clinton left office than it was on his first day.

Do you really think that China or Russia would come to the aid of a liquified Iran?  Maybe N.

Where are global fronts? It`ll be a regional war at the most. It wouldn't be WW3, in fact I doubt any Americans will be there, it`ll be American Rockets, Bombs, Intel, Bullets...but not Americans.  How do you think Israel defeated Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia all at the same time during their war?  American Technology my friend. Dude, its spelled ISRAEL not ISEAL or ISREAL<br>  <br>  Old Goat:<br>  I highly Doubt that.  Don't you think that known terror training camps in the US would be front page news.

OhWmu0R3aa	The impact of the US in WWI in terms of a combat force was fairly negligible. The troops were poorly trained, badly equipped and the higher ranking officers were not prepared to heed warnings regarding this new "mechanised" warfare and thus repeated all the mistakes that had been made earlier in the war, leading to entire regiments of Americans being rapidly slaughtered for little gain.<br>  <br>  The reason for the eventual armistice coming just a few months after the first US soldier set foot in Europe was nothing to do with their arrival but rather mainly due to Germany's crumbling infrastructure, hastened by the Royal Navy blockade of it's ports. Most of the hard work had already been done.<br>  <br>  The main reason for the US entry into the conflict was to secure itself a seat at the peace negotiations which would give it a voice in post-war European politics and use that to expand it's newly gained economic strength (created by selling arms, munitions and other materials to BOTH sides during the war) with new international markets. Wilson new this would only come about if US troops were to fight and bleed along with other nations, so after waiting as long as possible, the excuse of the Lusitania and the Zimmerman telegram were given for reasons to enter.|`|VeWD8Io2aa	Well, the war ended a mere 11 months after the 14 points speech and had been waged for 3 years prior to so I'd say our involvement had the Kaiser pissing his pantaloons!<br>  Simple answer, when we entered it was a certain victory!|`|NZuJR79oaa	my source is the history textbook next to me. <br>  <br>  The US held the french german line by reenforcing the french. Had this not happened the Germans most likely would have won.<br>  <br>  Wilson was not allowed to make any decisions in the Treaty of Versailles which ended the war.  Had his 12 point plan been implemented, then WWII most likely would not have occured.  Hitler only came to power because of the collapse of the financial system due to war reparations.

I don't know if I would use those specific terms but the RNC does need to update its image a little. It has a ton of resources to work with and needs to move from the neocon or more correctly Religious Right to a more open/younger group. I realize that people feel the the Republican party is just filled with old men, but you have to realize the organization on the right is pretty impressive. There is already a College Republican National Committee (something that the left does not have an equivalent to) if you could align the youth that does work with this organization to the bigger picture you would increase the amount of young and diverse individuals in the party. I think this was a good choice and there is a need to make over the Republican party if there is to be any hope of winning some seats in the mid-term elections or even the Presidential seat in 4 years. <br>  <br>  Also, MLK was not a Democrat or a Republican. There is no proof that he was registered as either although there has been talk/ads of him being registered as a Republican. His father was a registered Republican which might add to the confusion.|`|yViX0rLxaa	Hip-Hop Is TOTALLY American--!

And the rocket only has a 1500 mile stretch, which is a long way from "anywhere".<br>  <br>  The only reason Pakistan was in our corner during the Bush administration is that we were paying for his dictatorship.  When we stopped paying, the Pakistani people elected a civilian government with no loyalties to the US.  In addition, the military is unwilling to give up the control they had under Musharraf and are thwarting the civilian government at every turn.  So a rapprochement with the Taliban seems like the easiest way for the government to protect its citizens.  That may be a flawed approach, but it has nothing to do with Obama.<br>  <br>  The reasons for Putin opening a base in Abkhazia are far more complicated than the American President.  Russia began its takeover there during the Bush Administration and he was unable to control them any more than Obama can.<br>  <br>  Since Chavez didn't just declare himself "dictator for life" but actually put the question to the electorate, it is consistent with the democratic process.

The government cannot discriminate one person from another regardless of anything because of liability.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  Joe smokes crack daily. Joe is on welfare. Government randomly tests Joe for drug usage because he is on welfare. Joe tests positive. Government suspends paying Joe money. Joe acquires a Civil Liberties attorney. Joe sues the government. The government HAS to pay because drug abuse is considered a disease. The government now has lost millions as opposed to the several thousand a year it would pay out.<br>  <br>  Also, do not get unemployment confused with welfare. A chunk of the money is going for people who are on unemployment because of layoffs. Unemployment is government insurance that you and your employer pay into while you work.

Lawmaker Arrested On OWI, Marijuana ChargesMADISON, Wis. (AP) ―  <br>  Click to enlarge<br>   Rep.

Jeffrey Wood, who in November became the first independent in decades elected to the Legislature, was arrested early Friday by the Wisconsin State Patrol.<br>  <br>  A deputy at the Columbia County Jail said Wood was arrested on charges of operating while intoxicated-first offense, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. Wood was booked at about 3 a.m. and released by about 9 a.m., when he posted $200 bond. He is to appear in court Jan. 26.<br>  <br>  The state patrol said Wood was arrested on Interstate 90 in south central Wisconsin, far from the northwestern district he represents. The patrol did not immediately release the arrest report and authorities did not say how much marijuana he allegedly possessed.<br>  <br>  "There is no excuse for my actions, and I accept full responsibility," Wood said in a statement. "This is not typical behavior for me, but unfortunately I drank too much and exercised very poor judgment. I want to let my family and friends know that I regret what I did and am very sorry for the embarrassment and pain I have caused."<br>  <br>  Wood did not immediately return phone messages left at his home and office. He told Newstalk 790 WAYY, a radio station in Eau Claire, that he had no plans to step down. He also tried to explain how marijuana ended up in his car.<br>  <br>  "Somebody offered me some and I took it, and for whatever stupid reason got in my car and decided to drive home," he told the station.<br>  <br>  Wood was elected to the Assembly in 2002 as a Republican but he quit the GOP earlier this year. He accused party leaders of retaliating against him for showing too much independence. The party responded by trying to oust him from office by backing GOP candidate Don Moga in the general election.<br>  <br>  Wood won the race by 178 votes, and Democrats who took control of the chamber rewarded Wood for his defection this month by making him chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee.<br>  <br>  Assembly Speaker Mike Sheridan, D-Janesville, said Monday that Wood agreed not to serve in that post after his arrest. "With serious charges pending, I believe that to be the right course of action," Sheridan said.<br>  <br>  Sheridan said he was "shocked and deeply concerned" about the arrest.<br>  <br>  District Attorney Jane Kohlwey said she had not yet filed formal charges against Wood, of Bloomer. She said she is waiting for reports describing the incident from the patrol.<br>  <br>  "This will be handled just like we'd handle any other intoxicated driving case," she said.<br>  <br>  Wood, 39, is a married father of two, Navy veteran and former small business owner and local government reporter, according to his official biography. He represents the 67th Assembly District, which includes parts of Barron, Chippewa and Dunn counties.<br>  <br>  The arrest comes as lawmakers are considering measures to get tougher on drunken driving, a major problem in beer-loving Wisconsin. Advocates for victims are pushing for the state to treat first-offense drunken driving as a crime instead of a civil infraction (Wisconsin is the last state not to do so.)<br>  <br>  Wood joins a long line of state elected officials who have been arrested for drunken driving, including former Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager and Senate Majority Leader Russ Decker.

There was an agreement made in 1971 with OPEC that oil be traded in US dollars. In 1999, Iraq decided they wanted to trade oil in Euros, which threatened our economy, which is really why we invaded in the first place. Iran wants to do the same, which is why they've been on our target list. We invaded Afghanistan to try to control the oil pipeline between Russia and Europe so we can hold Europe for ransom if they don't continue to agree to trade oil for dollars instead of Euros.<br>  <br>  Right now, our economy is in it's death throws...we have temporary deflation (meaning it takes less dollars to buy stuff, and prices have come down). But this is going to be followed very soon by hyper-inflation because our idiot government thinks it can spend it's way out of this problem. Here's an example from chrismartenson.com: <br>  <br>  "Here’s a relatively recent example that comes from Yugoslavia between the years 1988 and 1995. Pre-1990, the Yugoslavian dinar had measurable value: You could actually buy something with one. However, throughout the 1980’s, the Yugoslavian government ran a persistent budget deficit and printed money to make up the shortfall. By the early 1990’s, the government had used up all its own hard currency reserves, and they proceeded to loot the private accounts of citizens. In order to keep things moving along, successively larger bills had to be printed, finally culminating in this stunning example – a 500 billion dinar note. At its height, inflation in Yugoslavia was running at over 37% per day. This means prices were doubling every 48 hours or so. <br>  <br>  Let me see if I can make that more concrete for you. Suppose that on January 1, 2007, you had a penny and could find something to purchase with it. At 37% per day inflation, by April 3, 2007 you’d need one of these – a billion dollar bill – to purchase the very same item. In reverse, if you’d had a billion dollars on January 1st stuffed in a suitcase, by April 3rd you’d have had a penny’s worth of purchasing power left."<br>  <br>  So, you see, unless our government slashes it's agencies and programs, and gets out of the market so it's capitalistic again... And people who can work get out there and start businesses instead of getting a handout, we're not going to make it out of this "recession". Our currency is going to collapse and we're going to have to take either the Amero (research CAFTA and the proposed North American Union), or there will be some other global currency imposed on us.|`|g2GSdY8Aaa	Amen sister. You noticed that as well. Funny how the price of a barrel plummets and the price at the pump is rising, all orchestrated by the oil companies. Blows a hole in supply and demand theory with regards to pump prices, more like manipulation by the oil companies to keep profits at an acceptable level. Cut back refining and jab the consumer just a little more before they are sucked dry. Today's economists haven't a clue on how main street economics works.|`|3lur9XHOaa	OK and you get to set the profit margin.  What percentage of profit would be acceptable to you?  5%? 10%? 20%?  The "biggest profits in history" was about 10% profit margin.  Anything less than 10% will mean that no one will invest into the oil industry....therefore no advancements.

The profit margin on gasoline is very small compared to other products in our economy.  They make huge profits because of the volumes they are producing.  This is America!  They can charge what the markets will bear and should.  Most oil companies are public companies and ordinary Americans are benefitting from these same profits.<br>  <br>  People are missing their mortgage payments because they were given loans that they could not afford, no matter what the price of gasoline.  CNN reported on a man getting a $350K mortgage with income of $7,900/yr.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	Finally someone who GETS it.  Ever since hurricane Katrina, oil and gas prices have risen to record highs, and oil companies have made HUGE profits.  During the election 2 years ago, when the Dems regained the majority in Congress, they all ran on....Change, and lowering gas prices.  In case no one noticed, gas and oil prices reached their highest levels EVER reaching over $4.00 a gallon, some places were over $5.00, and remote areas were charging $8.00 a gallon, and the wonderful men and women in the dem controlled congress did nothing....sure they had hearings last year, but it did nothing, and neither did congress.<br>  <br>  It is these high gas prices that directely affected people the most, and cause problems in the housing market, not to mention that the Dems knew but would not admit, that Fannie and Freddie were in fact in trouble, but would not regulate as to who they would lend to.  They were still handing out loans to people making less than $10.00 per hour, and with the price of houses these days or those days, thier mortgage pymt was pricey to say the least, fannie and freddie knew that these ppl were not going to be able to pay thier mortgages, especially since the buld of our money was having to pay for gas.  The govt then as it is now, did not care about the people of this country or how this was going to affect our economy in the long run......well now they do, but will they ever admit that the price of gas after Katrina affect everything since then.......NO........they will not.  The only reason, is because it is easier to blame a former president, and sure he holds some blame in this, but you know what.....the Reps. brought this to the attention of the Dems long ago.....and I believe that it was Maxine Waters who said...."there is nothing wrong with fannie and freddie", when in fact there was.  Could the Dems have done something when they regainded control of congress.....you bet, but they knew that people were stupid enough to believe them, and not do the research to find out the truth, and to actually track our failing economy back to gas prices and how it would affect our future economy.|`|k5WdChc7aa	You do realize that the majority of price you pay for each gallon of gas is TAXES to state and federal governments, right?<br>  <br>  At the height of George Bush's Presidency, the oil companies were only making like a 10 to 15% profit on each gallon sold. That, at most, $0.15 on every dollar as profit.<br>  <br>  You want to blame Big Oil?

Israel on the other hand has killed 10's of thousands of Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, with a large percentage of women and children.  Just in the last Israeli war on Gaza, Israel killed 1330 people, 80% of whom were civilian and half of those were women and children.  Half of the other 20% were policemen, who were killed in the initial Israeli air strike on Gaza.  Those are classified under international law as civilian, and the attack on the police headquarters is considered a war crime.
qEp9fxU9aa	The reason Swiss bank accounts were secret is because there was no such thing as income tax on interest earned in Switzerland.  Since it was therefore not illegal to not claim interest income from your bank account there was no reason for Switzerland to release this information and per their laws they wouldn't release this information because no crime was committed.  They could care less if the US or others felt tax evasion was occurring in their country, it was legal in Switzerland and therefore irrelevant.  Switzerland has considered on several occasions changing their tax code to include taxing interest income and therefore not paying taxes on this money would become a crime in Switzerland as well and therefore they would release information about accounts if requested through the proper subpeona process.  I don't think this will actually happen because so much money would leave their banking system that they would have a net loss of tax revenue and it would defeat the purpose of changing taxes on individuals if you loose more than that amount due to not collected near as much from banks and other entities supported by the additional capital remaining in Switzerland.  The term public will never mean public the way most people view it it would only potentially mean that the information would be available per subpeona in a court case deemed legal by Switzerland's courts.

2osISRIfaa	There are two kinds of "conservative" pundits; The Bush Kissing Crones (like the majority of fox news) and actual conservatives.  The Bushies didn't say much about the increased debt because they were loyal to the administration.  The other sort did speak up and were critical of the administration.  Those were lumped into the same "if you don't agree with our doctrine you're not a patriot" like all of the groups that were critical of the bush administration. <br>  <br>  and as for this comment: <br>  "Bush is not in office anymore. Does it matter?*"<br>  <br>  -This isn't a comment on the bush administration; this is a comment on media, punditry and public outcry of people that still are in the public arena (I.E.

There appears to be a sense of insular authority to manage the accrued wealth that "We The People" as a nation have produced.<br>  <br>  "Factory Model" education lends credence to the notion that tax payers and voters await the "voice of authority" for assurance that correct decisions and plans are being made.   <br>  <br>  Entrusting leadership with extraordinary wealth is a risk little understood by "We The People".  Few tax payers and voters in the mainstream comprehend the magnitude of a Million, Billion, or Trillion Dollars.  These levels of wealth transform some leaders into the puppets of special interests.  <br>  <br>  Avarice and thievery at the expense of the mainstream has become a reality.  Regime management has become close to the standard operating procedure.  When CEO's and Federal Department Secretaries explain that Billions of Dollars have literally disappeared and expect "We The People" to believe the illogical information, there is a question of whose interests are being served.<br>  <br>  Mass media is enlisted to facilitate the charades that cripple the economic well being of "We The People".  Disguising spending on military operations as the pursuit of "Weapons Of Mass Destruction" President George W. Bush orchestrated the elevation of military financial resources to stratospheric levels.  Anyone who questioned the spending risked being identified in the media as "unpatriotic".<br>  <br>  Conservative sentiment loyal to the regime of President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard Cheney seem to arogantly ignore that the relationship between Kellogg, Brown, & Root and Haliburton is public information.   The Military Industrial Complex of which President Dwight D. Eisenhower speaks cautionary in the "Farewell Adress".  <br>  <br>  The warnings of President Eisenhower are prophetic.<br>  <br>  Conservative Pundits under estimate the capacity of "We The People" for critical thinking.  The predictions of the election evidence the ability of people to look beyond the dubious rhetoric.   <br>  <br>  These pundits arouse adversarial interests and serve the sponsoring advertisers.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Bush's budget deficits were moderate, and had an expansionary affect on the economy.

Even to a 'conservative', maybe even particularly to a conservative, this should be considered a slap in the face.  Nobody has slammed the 'rich' either. It's just that they're expected to shoulder as much of the burden as they can.  If you've ever driven by a veteran's cemetery you'll see a lot of guys who shouldered a burden much larger than tossing a few extra bucks into the national hat.  Thirteen bucks a week times several millions of your brothers and sisters adds up to a lot of money flowing into the cash registers of a lot of business'.  That's 6 1/2 gallons of gas.....about what I burn in a week getting to work and back.  Lucky me; I still have a job.

These mid-year shortfalls are in addition to $48 billion in budget gaps that 29 states closed when enacting their fiscal 2009 budgets, which began on July 1 in most states.  Total fiscal 2009 budget gaps equal 15 percent of these states’ general fund (operating) budgets. <br>  Forty-three states already project shortfalls totaling close to $94 billion for fiscal 2010 (which in most states begins July 1, 2009).

Iran and Iraq have never been good neighbors, but what encouraged Saddam to attack Iran was the US support and the groundless thinking inspired by USA that Iran cannot survive after expelling US puppet, Shah from Iran. Saddam had planned to be in Tehran in a week. yes he was such an idiot dictator, but could not do all that without US support. <br>  <br>  It is proved that historical memory is so transient and people soon forget things.

Iraq declared victory in 1988 but actually achieved a weary return to the status quo ante bellum. The war left Iraq with the largest military establishment in the Persian Gulf region but with huge debts and an ongoing rebellion by Kurdish elements in the northern mountains. The government suppressed the rebellion using chemical weapons on the rebels.<br>  <br>  Between 1986 and 1989, Hussein's Al-Anfal Campaign is alleged to have killed an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Kurdish civilians.[6][7]<br>  <br>  A mass chemical weapons attack on the city of Halabja in March 1988 during the Iran–Iraq War is usually attributed to Saddam's regime, although responsibility for the attack is a matter of some dispute[8]. Saddam maintained his innocence in this matter up to his execution in December 2006. Almost all current accounts, influenced by special interests, of the incident regard the Iraqi regime as the party responsible for the gas attack (as opposed to Iran), and the event has become iconic in depictions of Saddam's cruelty. Estimates of casualties range from several hundred to at least 7,000 people. The Iraqi government continued to be supported by a broad international community including most of the West, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, which continued sending arms shipments to combat Iran. Indeed, shipments from the US (though always a minority) increased after this date, and the UK awarded ￡400 million in trade credits to Iraq ten days after condemning the massacre [3].<br>  <br>  In the late 1970s, Iraq purchased a French nuclear reactor, dubbed Osirak or Tammuz 1. Construction began in 1979. In 1980, the reactor site suffered minor damage due to an Iranian air strike, and in 1981, before the reactor could be completed, it was, in violation of International Laws[citation needed], destroyed by the Israeli Air Force (see Operation Opera).<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Invasion of Kuwait and the Gulf War<br>  A long-standing territorial dispute led to the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Iraq accused Kuwait of violating the Iraqi border to secure oil resources, and demanded that its debt repayments should be waived. Direct negotiations began in July 1990, but they soon failed. Saddam Hussein had an emergency meeting with April Glaspie, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, on 25 July 1990, airing his concerns but stating his intention to continue talks. April Glaspie informed Saddām that the United States had no interest in border disputes between Iraq and Kuwait, as was the U.S. government's official tone on the subject at the time. Subsequent events would prove otherwise, however this was said to Saddam in hopes that it would prevent him from attacking.<br>  <br>  Arab mediators convinced Iraq and Kuwait to negotiate their differences in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, on 1 August 1990, but that session resulted only in charges and counter-charges. A second session was scheduled to take place in Baghdad, but Iraq invaded Kuwait the following day. Iraqi troops overran the country shortly after midnight on August 2, 1990. The United Nations Security Council and the Arab League immediately condemned the Iraqi invasion. Four days later, the Security Council imposed an economic embargo on Iraq that prohibited nearly all trade with Iraq.<br>  <br>  Iraq responded to the sanctions by annexing Kuwait as the "19th Province" of Iraq on 8 August, prompting the exiled Sabah family to call for a stronger international response. Over the ensuing months, the United Nations Security Council passed a series of resolutions that condemned the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and implemented total mandatory economic sanctions against Iraq. Other countries subsequently provided support for "Operation Desert Shield". In November 1990, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 678, permitting member states to use all necessary means, authorizing military action against the Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait and demanded a complete withdrawal by 15 January 1991.<br>  <br>  When Saddam Hussein failed to comply with this demand, the Gulf War (Operation "Desert Storm") ensued on January 17, 1991 (3am Iraqi time), with allied troops of 28 countries, led by the US launching an aerial bombardment on Baghdad. The war, which proved disastrous for Iraq, lasted only six weeks. One hundred and forty-thousand tons of munitions had showered down on the country, the equivalent of seven Hiroshima bombs. Probably as many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers and tens of thousands of civilians were killed.<br>  <br>  Allied air raids destroyed roads, bridges, factories, and oil-industry facilities (shutting down the national refining and distribution system) and disrupted electric, telephone, and water service. Conference centres and shopping and residential areas were hit. Hundreds of Iraqis were killed in the attack on the Al-Amiriyah bomb shelter. Diseases spread through contaminated drinking water because water purification and sewage treatment facilities could not operate without electricity.<br>  <br>  A cease-fire was announced by the US on 28 February 1991. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar met with Saddam Hussein to discuss the Security Council timetable for the withdraw of troops from Kuwait. Iraq agreed to UN terms for a permanent cease-fire in April 1991, and strict conditions were imposed, demanding the disclosure and destruction of all stockpiles of weapons.<br>  <br>  <br>  Iraq under UN Sanction<br>  See also: Iraq sanctions <br>  On 6 August 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 661 which imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, providing for a full trade embargo, excluding medical supplies, food and other items of humanitarian necessity, these to be determined by the Security Council sanctions committee. After the end of the Gulf War and after the Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the sanctions were linked to removal of weapons of mass destruction by Resolution 687 [4].<br>  <br>  The United States, citing a need to prevent the genocide of the Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq and the Kurds to the north, declared "air exclusion zones" north of the 36th parallel and south of the 32nd parallel. The Clinton administration judged an alleged assassination attempt on former President George H. W. Bush by Iraqi secret agents to be worthy of a military response on 27 June 1993. The Iraqi Intelligence Headquarters in Baghdad was targeted by Tomahawk cruise missiles.<br>  <br>  During the time of the UN sanctions, internal and external opposition to the Ba'ath government was weak and divided. In May 1995, Saddam sacked his half-brother, Wathban, as Interior Minister and in July demoted his Defense Minister, Ali Hassan al-Majid. These personnel changes were the result of the growth in power of Saddām Hussein's two sons, Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein, who were given effective vice-presidential authority in May 1995. In August Major General Husayn Kāmil Hasan al-Majīd, Minister of Military Industries and a political ally of Saddam, defected to Jordan, together with his wife (one of Saddam's daughters) and his brother, Saddam, who was married to another of the president's daughters; both called for the overthrow of the Iraqi government. After a few weeks in Jordan, being given promises for their safety, the two brothers returned to Iraq where they were killed.<br>  <br>  During the latter part of the 1990s the UN considered relaxing the sanctions imposed because of the hardships suffered by ordinary Iraqis. According to UN estimates, between 500,000 and 1.2 million children died [5] during the years of the sanctions. The United States used its veto in the UN Security Council to block the proposal to lift the sanctions because of the continued failure of Iraq to verify disarmament. However, an oil for food program was established in 1996 to ease the effects of sanctions.<br>  <br>  Iraqi cooperation with UN weapons inspection teams was questioned on several occasions during the 1990s. UNSCOM chief weapons inspector Richard Butler withdrew his team from Iraq in November 1998 because of Iraq's lack of cooperation. The team returned in December.[9] Butler prepared a report for the UN Security Council afterwards in which he expressed dissatisfaction with the level of compliance [6]. The same month, US President Bill Clinton authorized air strikes on government targets and military facilities. Air strikes against military facilities and alleged WMD sites continued into 2002.|`|eu6UQElYaa	It worked for Democrats when they wanted to defend Clinton's invasion of Serbia to go after Miloskevic.<br>  Really though, that wasn't the reason cited for going into either Afghanistan or Iraq, however the liberation of oppressed people is not something terrible and when that happens even as the result of a war (and even an unpopular one) it's a good thing.   Those people ARE indeed better off with a democratically elected government than they were with a genocidal tyrant.
RkfIPD7Iaa	In general, citizenship or immigration status has no bearing on the ability to file or win a lawsuit, so potentially she could do this.  She has no case, of course, since she has suffered no damages.  At worst, she could try to file charges, but this is such a minor issue, I suspect the DA will just ignore it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But quite frankly, if you're young enough that she 'told your mom, you have an exaggerated view of the impact of this on whatever political campaign you're involved with.  The newspapers aren't interested in the silliness of so-called threats from a low level staffer in a political campaign.|`|RjUhISEIaa	The key question posted back to you is...did you threaten the children?<br>  <br>  The computer is worth $1000? Take her to small claims court and get it settled there. <br>  <br>  And ask this question too of yourself. If she is illegal do you think she'll do anything and risk getting deported? She's playing a game with you so file the case and go for the money or the computer. You'll win a judgment but don't know if she'll stick around to pay it or go home.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jhNUuz0maa	One thing you can keep in mind, if she would file a suit against you, the authorities will realize she is not legal and she will be deported that way. She could win a suit against you, if you broke the law, but she would end up losing in the end.<br>  <br>  Also, as far as the political thing, this can be spun in all sorts of ways. First off, you worked for an illegal, so that might be used later against you. Everything in your life will be looked at and scrutinized. Plus, if this person wants some publicity, they will bring it up and make you look bad, even though nothing happened. I can see it now, the kids will be on tv crying saying you threatened harm to them. Probably a few made up things will be put out there too, and you will have to defend yourself and your actions, even though there was nothing wrong.|`|tOBUxfYvaa	Her being illegal has no bearing on being able to file a law suit, illegals can file suit. She does however, lack standing to sue from what you've said, meaning that she has no case and if she filed a complaint, it would likely be thrown out. You didn't physically threaten her. For future reference, if you care about your role in politics, it would be wise to not associate with illegal criminals.
v9EXG82Kaa	Probably murder. If the molester has been arrested and through the  penal system and served or is serving a prison sentence then that is the justice of the law of the land. If you or anyone else killed the molester it would be classed as premeditated murder and whoever did it would inccur a prison sentence which could be 25 years or life. Revenge is sweet but life is unfair. Don't do it.|`|ZzJmUerpaa	can the molestation be proven?--and if you can bring forth witnesses and if the young person is willing to affirm the fact then heres the defense.--Grief stricken --get psychiatrist to interview and affirm the mental health.--they will write a compelling argument that the only way the grief-demons would leave his brain is by eradicating the problem--i.e. temporary insanity|`|BEqAhXBlaa	depends on the situation and wether it was premeditated, but dont go thinking the fact he molested a relative will hold any water in court|`|TSc8OE4vaa	The law doesn't care why you did it, it only cares what you did.  So it would be treated just like a regular murder case with the normal murder punishments. It would not be manslaughter unless it was proven to be accidental.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Sadly the outcome would inevitably mean imprisonment but I don't believe it should.

eKdRjaySaa	Around 13 years|`|hBHHB8Kxaa	The sentence is carried out by the Judge. Life is not a definitive number in Scotland, however  'the law is set out in the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, as amended in relation to life prisoners by the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001, which incorporated changes to ensure that the procedure is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights.' So maybe looking into the Convention on Human Rights may give a numbered time period.

7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Lost mine. The economy in my city has been tanking for a solid two years now. If anyone had been living in a city like mine..they could see a preview for the nation to come. Ours started because our officials here act like royalty and do a lot of their own pay to play. One excellent example is a city lot in our historic downtown area was slated for an "open air" shopping center. Two years later and a couple of piles of dirt...it sits in worse condition than it was before they started. They handed a CITY project off to a person who lived thousands of miles away without so much as checking his credentials. He was GIVEN taxpayer money to do the project and ran with it. He is being sued...but as you can imagine, they have a hard time FINDING him to serve him the papers. We have several contractors here in town that should have been awarded that contract, but no. Instead, the "sandlot" remains empty along with the money for the project being noticeably absent. Also in my city, we have three solid blocks covered by government buildings and there are two huge socialite magazines produced every month. Yet...we have had 20 restaurants close their doors over the past six months. So...needless to say, we are moving. Our newspaper is owned by the New York Times, so you can imagine...it sucks. It has lost subscribers by the millions for many reasons...they treat the paper as another socialite outlet, looks more like a yearbook for the rich....and they can't keep their books straight.|`|MM8rqTMtaa	I was able to weasel myself into a project with skill-sets that will provide job security until I retire, and the company pays for the training.

AA10236380	You're certainly not alone in this economy as someone who's under-employed and really feeling the pinch as your basic expenses outpace your wages.<br>  <br>  You're also correct (in my opinion) that econonomically speaking, the sky is falling.<br>  <br>  You can think of it as a game of musical chairs.  Every few weeks the music stops, a few chairs are taken away, and we all scramble for the remaining ones.<br>  <br>  The trick then is to make sure you get your chair.<br>  <br>  1.  Focus your job search efforts<br>      (A) on the fields that are likely to grow or remain stable, e.g. health care, alternative energy, personalized services to the very wealthy, services necessary for people who become unemployed, need to relocate, etc.<br>      (B) on building your personal network of contacts in those areas.  Applying online and mailing unsolicited resumes is a dead-end; you need to make contact with prospective employers to get on their radar before there are openings.<br>  <br>  2.  Be realistic.  Top candidates are taking 6-12 months to find work; most of us are taking 12-24 months these days.  You could get lucky and be re-employed in a week, but plan on this being a long-haul process.<br>  <br>  3.  Chip away at building your qualifications for a better job.  If schooling's out of the quesition for financial reasons, at least try to get hands-on experience in your field of choice as a volunteer.<br>  <br>  4.  Get way, Depression-era-creative about controlling costs.  Is it time to take on a roommate?  Can you get by with public transportation, or at least use it more to lower your vehicle expenses?  Your phone internet are indispensible, but cable TV is $60/month you can save.  Think Survival Mode for the time being.<br>  <br>  5.  Exercise and eat right.  Staying physically and mentally sharp will help you manage the stress much more effectively and will positively impact how employers percieve you.  Fruit, veggies and yogurt are just as cheap as fast food, and you don't need a health club membership to do a daily walk or some crunches.<br>  <br>  6.  Keep a journal so you can see your progress and identify what things are working best for you.|`|yViX0rLxaa	Are you white? Then obanana doesn't care--so get used to it--suck it up and die--and see if this presodent notices one white death?|`|AA11163314	The sad thing is that you are going to just have to tough it out until the next set of elections.  <br>  <br>  The spending bill that was just passed is going to cost more new jobs than it will create.  (The money to finance the programs will come out of the capital and investment markets - which is where funding for new business and business expansion comes from.)|`|dCewrtXaaa	You are going to have to get creative, like people did in the Great Depression. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, and think of ways to get out of the box you find yourself in. <br>  <br>  1. You live alone. Maybe you can't afford to live alone any more. If you could share rent with a roommate, that would lower expenses for both of you and the company could cheer you up. If you have family in the area, consider sharing housing with them.<br>  <br>  2. If there are no jobs where you live, live where there are jobs. The health care industry is one sector that is still hiring, and there are others as suggested by Ed the Spartan. Maybe you need to get retrained to work in one of those, and move somewhere else to work if there are absolutely no jobs in your area. Maybe you and some of your unemployed friends could train and move together. <br>  <br>  3. As a personal fitness trainer, you know the benefits of exercise. Are you out there walking or jogging? That ought to give you some mental energy as well as physical energy and fresh air.<br>  <br>  4. Don't forget it's February. A lot of people feel more miserable this month and get the "February doldrums." Hey, spring is right around the corner and things will start looking up!<br>  <br>  5. Are you still paying for cable TV? Going to the movies? Those are luxuries you can do without. Rediscover the radio and the public library. Join some clubs. Do volunteer work to help those less fortunate than yourself. That should help put things in perspective for you. Don't forget that time is money too.<br>  <br>  6. Remember the old New England rhyme: Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without. Were you in the habit of throwing away socks with holes in them? Darn them. Take care of your clothes and shoes and they will last longer. Do preventive maintenance on your car or you could take the bus, bicycle or walk more if necessary. A car is a big expense.<br>  <br>  7. Do what the rest of the world does. Barter. There are a lot of goods or services that you could trade your expertise as a personal fitness trainer for. Before there was health insurance, my grandmother used to barter her skill as a seamstress for medical services for her children. She made clothes for the doc's family, including a wedding dress for his daughter, and he took care of her kids. All you have to do is get out there and pitch your ideas. Always have business cards with you.<br>  <br>  8. Form a food co-op for economies of scale. Buy foods and household goods only on special, in quantity, and divvy up costs and shopping time among friends and neighbors. You can do the same thing with cooking. Get together with friends and chip in. It's cheaper to cook for a group than for one, and the camaraderie is just gravy.<br>  <br>  9. Hard times like these bring out either the best or the worst in people. Make sure that they bring out the best in you. And no, you aren't alone.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	You're not alone, their are lots of regions similar to yours, and lots of people that feel that miserable.<br>  <br>  Things should get better eventually, just hang in there.|`|B1VxBl2paa	Don't worry as I've been told by my democratic betters, you're just a dirty unwashed subhuman southerner who deserves to be in the situation you're in.<br>  <br>  Oh and look forward to more taxes.|`|My65doewaa	Welcome to Obamanomics.  Expect this to get worse, as Obama's policies cause massive inflation and continued economic chaos.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Get a different job!

McCarthyism is like a minor version of the Nazis in all honesty. While there are no McCarthyist parties there are still political parties sympathetic to many of their views. If you want a party that actually might go somewhere, the republican party is your choice. However there are third parties which have more McCarthyist views, such as the Multicapitalist party, Christian Falangist Party of America, Prohibition Party and controversially but truthfully the American Nazi Party.

The boys at home are just as important as the ones in the field.  The decision you've really got to make is whether or not you're up for a tour abroad.  Know that currently overseas deployment is extended past the scheduled return date, so you may sign up for a year and get deployed for 4 (or until we "Win" in Afghanistan.")  <br>  <br>  Personally, I'd stay home.

47eiwyMLaa	Beren--when you license something, you propose to have authority over it. Owning any "arms" is a RIGHT granted by God and guaranteed in the 2nd amendment. It is not a privilege that can be restricted as much as the government would like to control it.<br>  <br>  Read this bill...the reason he proposed it was because he wants to do studies on firearms deaths/injuries and keep up on manufacture production--GIVE ME A BREAK! They're making a database of people who own guns, what model they own, and when they got it. WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL THAT MAKE ON CRIME or HOW WILL IT IMPROVE THEIR RESEARCH? How can we already have statistics on firearm related homicides or injuries if it's not already possible to track that through police investigations and the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR). Crime isn't crime until AFTER it's happened. To propose a database of owners prior to a crime, assumes a crime will happen, and makes those owners SUSPECTS. You have to give your photo and finger print which invades the privacy of responsible, law-abiding citizens. You're not going to prevent the crime by enacting this into law, just get stats after the fact.<br>  <br>  This is straight out of the communist manifesto folks--READ IT.

Your employer should give or send the W2 direct to you, and not pass it on through a former co-worker unless you have given the employer written authority to pass it on to a third party.<br>  <br>  Your co-worker should not give out your personal details to anyone unless you have first authorized this. So the person should check with you first to make sure you agree that your phone number should be given to your former boss.<br>  <br>  So, from what I can see, a lot of your anger is actually mis-directed and you should be pleased that people are doing the right thing by observing confidentiality, and not be annoyed because their failure to pass on the W2 on the one hand and the phone number on the other hand without first obtaining your agreement to this course of action.<br>  <br>  So if your employer didn't have your updated address until a week ago, there was not much that could have been done until then.  It is true it ought to have been sent to you as soon as possible, but a week's delay after she knew your new address is not a lot in the whole scheme of life.  Especially if her business got shut down, she might be in a general anxious turmoil or depressed and not able to cope as efficiently as usual.  I agree with the Answerer who said just go and collect it if you need it quickly. <br>  Good luck.
NZuJR79oaa	I'm all for citizen initiative and referendum rights that are accessible and fair (unlike the insane limits and regulations most states have on these), however I think a republic form WITH TERM LIMITS is necessary for state and federal government so that we as individuals dont have to learn every single bill at every level of government.  <br>  <br>  I think alot more issues should be put to a direct vote in towns, cities and counties. <br>  <br>  Many on the far left hate direct democracy.<br>  <br>  Democracy is not two wolves and a sheep voting on whats for dinner.  If we have safeguards in place, such as a judicial system that overturns unconstitutional laws, and a constitutional amendment overturning Kelo and a constitutional amendment getting rid of wealth redistribution then it can be done.<br>  <br>  I trust my neighbors with decisions a hell of a lot more than career politicians.|`|AA11482024	You hang with the wrong crowd, then.

That contention seems to be that it is  because the constitutional "democracy" is not truly democratic and government is controlled by dogmas of excessive political correctness. Is that not what you mean too. But then the alternative ideologies do not seem to work any better. For example East Germany used to be call itself? "the Democratic Republic? of Germany" and was rather akin to what you advocate. But it had to build a very high wall and insert minefields and soldiers with machine guns or "hired guns" if you like that term, to stop people leaving that so-called "Peoples Democracy", before the wall eventually got pulled down and East Germany became like West Germany. Or North Korea do seem currently to claim to have the kind of government you advocate and their spokesmen say they are the happiest in the world, but they too seem to need hired guns and minefields to keep them from becoming like South Korea.|`|jEqISBnQaa	Yeah, the common sense in that first answer kinda grates, don't it, Bully?<br>  <br>  When you grow up, leave mommy's house, get a job, get married (oooooh!!! :-)), have kids, get a mortgage, and do your own laundry, you'll be surprised at how really, really stupid you sound.

RkfIPD7Iaa	You mean a learner's permit?  NO, those are only legal in the state in which they are issued.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|AA12370001	You can not with a permit.  You have to be a licensed driver in another state.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Well that depends...how old are you?  Oh you said PERMIT?  NO....now if you have a license.....<br>  <br>  Adults who visit another state may rely on their driver's licenses, but the same may not be true for young drivers. The driving age varies significantly from state to state (from 15 to 18), and a state that makes people wait longer to drive may not honor a license from a state that issues licenses to younger folks. For example, New Jersey issues licenses to 17-year-olds and will recognize a license from any other state if the driver is at least 17. But a 16-year-old who is legally permitted to drive in New York may not be allowed to drive in New Jersey. A young driver who plans to drive in another state where the legal limit is above his or her age should call that state's department of motor vehicles to find out what the rules are.<br>  <br>  If you make the age requirements for all States there is no problem.  You need to find out what the age limit is in New Hampshire.<br>  <br>  For anyone over 18....<br>  <br>  If you have a valid license from one state, you may use it in other states that you visit. But, if you make a permanent move to another state, you'll have to take a trip to the local department of motor vehicles to apply for a new license. Usually, you must do this within 30 days after moving to the new state. Most states will issue your new license without requiring tests, though some may ask you to take a vision test and a written exam covering basic driving rules.
ziZQWxi3aa	Well it's good that mortgage companies are going to extend their loans; foreclosure would suck if we ever got into that situation.  But we plan to be smart as new home owners.  As in when we get back our taxes; make sure we pay down some of the interest on our loan so that it is paid off sooner.  <br>  <br>  Foreclosure sucks and there really isn't any point to it; because most people who go through the foreclosure process really do want to keep their homes, they wanted a house/to be homeowners for some reason, obviously.  <br>  <br>  I'm glad that more people are actually paying attention this time.

However - personally, I don't see the problem, as it IS only temporary.<br>  <br>  An 'active roll' is... regular contact (either at your place or his, feeding, clothing, financial contributions to his upkeep, interaction with the child - basically everything a 'normal' father would do if he was there full-time.<br>  <br>  The Magistrate will ask what role he has had in the child's life - and both of you will be allowed to state your opinions.<br>  <br>  Essentially, the Magistrate has to decide (based on testimony and witnesses) which parent would provide the BEST continual care and support for the child.<br>  <br>  The VERY best of luck on the day anyway - let me know (via my email link) what happens !
2zym4J9xaa	"A volunteer is worth 10 pressed men" <br>  <br>  Well, that says it all right there.<br>  <br>  You're right.  The military might want to change their screening process.  It should be based on what you can do.  Not what someone else says you can or cannot do.<br>  <br>  And with the military having ranks with younger guys in charge of older guys, that seems fine.  When you are getting shot at, i doubt you care what age the guy is next to you giving out orders as long as they keep you safe.  They should also have experience and mental edge for ranking soldiers.  The guy that is 35 years old should be much more prepared for battle than a 17 year old kid.  Trust me!  Then again, the 23 year old who has 6 years in the military should be given credit too.  There should be credit given for all things.  age and experience, college credits and educations, military experience and battle experience.<br>  <br>  It always amazed me how a 22 year old ROTC guy was already worth more than a seasoned vet for 20 years who didn't go to college.<br>  <br>  I guess in the end.  The military is not perfect and that is why they have these problems.  Might be about time to rearrange how they do things.  We don't stand in lines and wait to get shot anymore.  this is not the Civil War era.  We are in a time of nuclear age.  Maybe they should start to realize that older men with experience in life and education are worth a lot.  They still are not doing much for age experience, only education.  But, physical youth is still prominent in an age where we can fight wars from chairs now.  Just plain ignorance.  They ignore facts to stick with tradition.  We no longer need patches for Airborne but they do it because of tradition.  We no longer need 2 classes of enlisted or officers, it should be 1 class from bottom to top and you should be able to jump in where you are qualified and work your way up.  But hey, that's just me.  I like to think 21st century.  Some people are still stuck in the 1800's<br>  <br>  The main problem with the military is they treat everyone the same.  Even age, everyone doesn't age the same way.  There are 17-20 year olds that are highly immature, and some mature.  Some are in great shape, some are a trainwreck.  Grouping all 35 year olds as the same is just another form of agism.  Some 35 year olds have 20 year old bodies.  Also, there are 20 year olds with minds like 35 year olds that get rewwarded, they are called officers.  They will reward you for education, but not for physicallity.  It's nonsense.  Age is not the same for everyone.  If it were all 35 year old men would have the same I.Q. and can do the same number of push -ups.  Worse than that, they would all look the same. <br>  <br>  If i said I was 35, what did you just picture?  You would be shocked by what I can do and what I look like.  I myself can out perform 95% of all people under 20 years old physically.  Probably 99% of all them mentally.  And as for looks, I bet I look younger than over 50% of everyone under 25.  So much for age, its another form of discrimination.  It lumps everyone as the same.  We are not all the same!!!!!|`|4VzVfKvdaa	I have no problem with anyone wanting to serve, no matter their age. However, it is not just about physical, but mental state.  Because they are more mature/experienced at life, they do not expect to be treated like a recruit and that does and has created problems that the military would just not rather deal with.  As someone already said, after awhile, it is difficult to get a 40 something person to go clean a head or pull weeds under the direction os a 20 something. Eventually there is a backlash and that 40 something feels picked on and becomes a discipline problem (I've seen it).  Add to that, someone that age usually have family and personal repsonsibilities that a 20 something hasn't acquired yet.  They may even have children that are old enough to serve.  Finally, there are the health isses as they get older that are unavoidable.  Now someone has to pick up their slack.  Why do you think the military has graduated PT passing test scores based on age?  Why is there not one physical standard regardless of age? The spirit may be willing, but the body....tends to break down over time.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	First, any military wants young men because they still believe the whole glory and sacrifice nonsense. Basically cannon fodder. Next, war is a young man's game (yeah women too). You start getting past mid-20's it's just not their game any more. Sure older is more experienced and mature, but in the military experience starts when you're young. They have had millenniums to figure this one out.<br>  <br>  Passing a PT test is not the same as humping a ruck for a week. Are there some that could, sure.  But on average no. And, the age restrictions are pretty lose these days.|`|LwPcGpAOaa	I agree with killer queen.  I was military for 8 yrs and starting at the bottom is hard for everyone but once your in your late 20's or older its very difficult to get bossed around buy someone ten years younger than you with very little life experience.  I joined at 19 but as the years passed I saw people who were only 25 join and have a real hard time adjusting.  Plus the military is set up so that if you want and you perform up to standards you stay for 20 yrs and get a retirement out of it. We want a force of young able bodied persons.  The military overall is not having issues recruiting these people so why lower the standard.|`|a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	From a former Air Force Military Training Instructor who spent 4 years training recruits:<br>  <br>  Simply put, no matter how motivated they may be, adults who are more than 35 years of age will find it impossible to meet the physical requirements of both basic training and the regular forces.  I had several Reservists in my flights while I was an MTI, most of which were either right at the cut-off age or within two years of it, and ALL of them had a VERY hard time passing Air Force basic training, which at that time was the easiest of the four services.  AFBMTS has become much more physically demanding now, and I'm absolutely positive that those same men would NOT finish now.<br>  <br>  As the old saying goes, "the spirit may be willing, but the body is weak."  As your body ages its abilities decrease, and unless you're some kind of fitness guru who works out every day, the average adult over the age of 35 simply will not physically be able to "pack the gear."  <br>  <br>  You also have to look a tad further down the road at the health of the individual 15 or 20 years later.  A recruit who joins at 18 years of age will be 38 if he/she retires at twenty years of service; this means that they most likely will not have started to show any of the negative aspects of physically aging.<br>  <br>  A recruit who joins at 35 years of age, however, is another thing entirely.  Ten years into service, when they're 45, they're going to start having physical problems that come with aging which will inhibit their abilities to physically perform.  By the time they're ready to retire, they'll be 55 - legally eligible to join the AARP, and will have all of the physical maladies to accompany it.  I'm 52 right now and I can tell you that there's NO WAY I could pack the gear now!  My body has aged, and it's just not capable of doing the things it could when I was 35, much less 18.<br>  <br>  Just a fact of life.<br>  <br>  Oh, and Ray....there are NO branches of the military that have a cut-off "in the twenties."  ALL branches of the military go by the federal law that was quoted in another post.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:  Yeah, it occurred to me, and the reason I didn't mention it is that the folks who are 35 and in the military have BEEN in the military for a number of years, attained the physical shape they needed to be in while in training, and then maintained it through their service's physical training program.  There is a HUGE difference in joining when you're 18, staying fit while in, and joining when you're 35 and NOT being in shape.  The number of people who could join at age 35 and meet the physical qualifications are the exception, rather than the rule.<br>  <br>  Obviously, you've never served in the military or you'd know that - and you never would have asked this question to begin with.|`|au0ssSnvaa	Because it is going to be hard to ask a 40 something person to go clean a head or chip paint or buff floors.<br>  <br>  I got a thumbs down but these are tasks junior sailors do all of the time. A person who is in they're 40's are set in they're ways and it is easier to mold a young person into the military. I'm not saying for all. <br>  <br>  Prior service would do fine past enlistment age if they could meet the phys requirements but who would want to be a E-1 at 44?????|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	old men can;t stay in PT formation and the equipment is heavy, the gun is 7 pounds and the ruck is usually about 20 then on top of that the vest is usually 20 pounds and the LBE is ten and the canteens filled with water on the LDE?LCE are about ten PDS. each as well and the helmets is five to ten pounds, we don;t need any man having a heart attack in the heat or heat stroke because they are too old carrying all this heavy equipment around in Iraq or during PT.|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	I full agree with you.  Who are they to tell you who can and can't volunteer for something just becasue your a little older.

I retired at age 50, and that was MY choice, as I came to see that I was no longer physically capable of keeping up with my peers, who were younger in age. <br>  <br>  Jim b. Toronto.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	If they are passed the cutoff age why didn't they join before?  <br>  <br>  Age <br>  <br>  One would think that age would be a simple category. One is either old enough, or too old, right? Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work that way. By federal law (10 U.S.C., 505), the minimum age for enlistment in the United States Military is 17 (with parental consent) and the maximum age is 35 (Note: Congress changed this to age 42 in 2006). However, DOD policy allows the individual services to specify the maximum age of enlistment based upon their own unique requirements. The individual services have set the following maximum ages for non-prior service enlistment: <br>  <br>  <br>  Active Army - 42 <br>  Army Reserves (Including National Guard) - 42 <br>  Active Air Force - 27 <br>  Air Force Reserve (inlcuding National Guard) - 34 <br>  Active Navy - 34 <br>  Naval Reserves - 39 <br>  Active Marines - 28 <br>  Marine Corps Reserve - 29 <br>  Active Duty Coast Guard - Age 27. Note: up to age 32 for those selected to attend A-school directly upon enlistment (this is mostly for prior service). <br>  Coast Guard Reserves - Age 39.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind older people are more prone to injuries and may have other health issues pending.  The body gets old no matter how well in shape it is.|`|VeWD8Io2aa	You seem to be fighting this but remember, whatever you say in Yahoo Answers it won't sway the decision of the DOD! <br>  The answer is really simple actually. Discipline. <br>  Once you reach a certain age you've pretty much figured life out. You know how to play the game. And you'll resent having to take orders from someone who's 10 or 15 years younger than you. I have a 2lt. who's 21yo. I'm 35. I was leading troops in the Middle East when he was groping his first hooter behind the bleachers after his HS football game! But he's my flight commander and even though I have more knowledge and experience in leading, I still have to follow his orders. Does it bug me? Of course it does! But I know that's the Military way and I will follow it. Now take a 35yo. recruit and tell him/her that he has to follow a 21yo's orders. They'll have a hard time swallowing it and many just plain won't because "they know it's not right".<br>  I enlisted at 18. The AF molded me because younger inexperienced people are more succeptible to be molded into a military lifestyle. It has nothing to do with physical fitness(well, some). It has to do with having an easier transition into the lifestyle that is required to serve. That's all. Even in basic, we had an ANG member(got laid off at a plant or something) who juuuuust made the cut off age. My TI was in a predicament as to how to motivate him. Finally he was made a "rope" just because of his age.  Now this guy couldn't lead any more than a 2lt with a compass and a map, but he was given the position, and promptly fired due to being a retard. The whole rest of basic he whined about having to take direction from the new 18yo rope. It got annoying and morale suffered because of it.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Right now the Army will accept applicants as long as they ship to basic by their 42nd birthday.  People who are over 42 who have prior service and want to come back in are usually elligible or waiverable to get back in.  There is a very small niche market of people who never wanted to serve until they are past 42.  While their motivation is commendable, it is not enough of a group to really make a difference, especially considering how much more likely you are to be injured as you get older and jump into the rigorous physical activity of the Army.<br>  <br>  As far as the branches that cut people off in their 20s go... they're just jerks.  :)|`|K8qAniReaa	1) Enlisting or receiving a commission requires a contract.  A person under the age of 18 cannot sign a contract.  Even though there are 17 year old teenagers with parents that can sign a contract on their behalf they still don't go to AIT until after they are 18.  Also, there is the minimum requirement of a high school diploma to serve in the military.  If a young person lacks the intelligence or the discipline to stick it out and get their degree they have no place in the military.<br>  <br>  2) Most people past the age of 42 lack the physical ability to get into the military.  However, the Army does give age waivers for those that pass the physical.  A 72 year old doctor just rejoined the military because he wanted to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Because everyone has to start at the bottom and work their way up.  By a certain age, most people expect to have more responsibility due to their experience.  I doubt if these same MEN would be very happy if they had to answer to those who were 20 years younger than them.<br>  <br>  There is already trouble when one enters at say the age of 26 and has a supervisor who is 21.  It's unsettling.  That is why they allow people to move out of dorms at that age even if they are single.  The maturity level is so vastly different, that it becomes irritating to live with much younger people.<br>  <br>  But if there was a way to give people credit for their experience and give them a higher rank, it might work.  But they still have to go through the same training as the new recruits so it probably wouldn't work.
67ThRN4Taa	Hi Will.  Congratulations on your pending graduation and commissioning.  I spent three years in the army from '76 to '79 and then twenty-one years in the reserve & ARNG, going back on active duty for Desert Storm.  I retired in December, 2000, as a Master Sergeant (E-8).<br>  <br>  As someone mentioned above, despite his good intentions your friend was wrong to tell that NCO that he didn't have to salute him.<br>  <br>  You are correct that senior NCOs are an excellent source of information and guidance for newly commissioned officers (and for years to come).  You've heard it a thousand times:  "The only stupid question.....is the one that doesn't get asked."<br>  <br>  DO NOT try to become "friends" with any enlisted men or NCOs under your command.  Maintain a professional distance.  "Familiarity breeds contempt."<br>  <br>  In my experience most NCOs do not "hate" officers.  Some small number of NCOs (and officers) are "jerks."  If we could test them all we'd probably discover that they suffer from bipolar-disorder, ADD, have anger-management issues and/or just had bad upbringings.  (It seems to me that an ever-increasing number of americans have bad up-bringings).<br>  <br>  NCOs don't hate officers but a newly commissioned 2LT--especially one that's full-of-himself and thinks that he knows more than he actually does--can be a source of aggravation & frustration.  "The most dangerous thing in the world is a 2LT with a map."<br>  <br>  The fact that you describe yourself as a nice & friendly guy is a source of concern for me.  I hope that you don't wind up in one of the combat-arms branches.  When I enlisted in '76 I very deliberately chose the infantry because I thought that it was going to be adventurous and exciting and involve learning how to "garrote" sentries and blow up bridges and study the "martial arts," etc.  <br>  <br>  I could not have been more wrong.  It was more about boredom, drudgery and physical discomfort than anything else.  And frankly, a great many of my fellow soldiers were "neanderthals" fresh down out of the trees; "The Hills Have Eyes."  (I remember thinking "How is it possible that these are even *americans*??")  Many of them should've been in prison or a mental hospital and I don't doubt that some of them eventually wound up there.<br>  <br>  The army will probably *not* be what you're expecting it to be, just like it wasn't for me.  But the very best of luck to you.<br>  <br>  P.S.  FYI:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ak4Vko3DyAIfIxV4CQjui2fty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090206120245AAHyhKm&show=7#profile-info-hdzChobKaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|UAW6fd4baa	You will do well with that attitude.Good Luck.|`|3WYcPsm4aa	You've got a wonderful attitude, and one which your SNCO's will truly respect.   As the spouse of a SNCO who regularly works with LTs, every time he got a new one in he either spoke well of them and how they were eager to listen and learn OR how they came into his flight and told him that he/she was now the flight commander and he/she would be making all decisions and changes, end of story.  <br>  <br>  Do be careful with familiarity, such as your friend allowing lower ranks to not salute.  I've seen young officers lose the respect of their men by doing things like that.|`|TVhmGspoaa	I was a college educated enlisted man so for that I got a lot of flack.  Enlisted men seem to assume officers have book smarts and lack common Sense.  Officers seem to assume all enlisted men are dumb and dont want to obey orders.  These are generalizations and should be taken as such.  Every soldier should be recognized as having their own positive and negative traits.<br>     As far a saluting, respect for the person being saluted has nothing to do with it.  Saluting is tradition and show respect for the Officer corps of the United States military.  You salute the uniform not the person.  A officer that fails to return a salute is insulting the military.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	Good attitude. On the question of saluting, you probably won't want to do that. If it's between you and him, fine, but not in public.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	Firstly, there is respect for the experience of a senior enlisted man, which is good. But the salute is not saluting the officer, it's saluting the commission. The SNCO should have told the LT that right away.<br>  Being in Command means making unpopular decisions, in a lot of cases the only other person who sees the "big picture" is the SNCO, it's a lonely position. be prepared to be unpopular with the lower ranks. It's inevitable.

Organizations are failing, national economies of several nations are suffering. and much of the world is in recession.

That remains to be seen.|`|HlTF3X3Baa	I think a large part of the declines from september onwards is due to the increasing risk that democrats would gain power.Investing in a deflationary depression is risky enough.

Regardless if Al is upset about it or not.  A lot of people of all races find this cartoon offensive, racist and insulting to our new president. There a history where racist white Americans refer blacks to apes, chimps and gorillas.  Bottom line:  It's not funny.  Any time where you have to explain the punch line. It's not funny.  Look at the racist answer you have on here.  :||`|VPFHP1A7aa	That cartoon does NOT refer to the dead chimp that is BS and you know it, that cartoon was racist disgusting and I am appauled as well.|`|A1iDPPOeaa	I can only presume to speak for myself, of course, but it should come as no surprise that I was highly offended by Delonas' cartoon...and I'm not a person who takes offense easily. I understand that jokes backfire. While I don't necessarily believe that Delonas is guilty of willfully perpetuating racism, he IS guilty of being just plain stupid. No reasonable person would, could, or should expect that this sort of thing is acceptable in even the most passing sense. Given this nation's history when it comes to race relations, this cartoon is the equivalent to pouring salt into an open wound...and for many African-Americans racism is still very much an open wound.<br>  <br>  It would be easy to chalk up Delonas' stupidity and insensitivity to the ignorance of a clueless, careless White Conservative thoroughly convinced of his own brilliance. The problem here is bigger than one very unfunny cartoonist guilty of indulging in some very blatant racist imagery. No, while Delonas' attempt at humor is both insulting and not funny, the demands for accountability should travel much far up the food chain at the Post. You can't credibly tell me that no one with editorial authority recognized the potentially incendiary and offensive nature of Delonas' cartoon. These sorts of things don't happen in a vacuum. Someone, likely several people, knew EXACTLY what the reaction to the cartoon would be...and they decided to run it anyway. These folks deserve to be frog-marched out of the Post's headquarters...right behind Sean Delonas.<br>  <br>  Then again, accountability has never exactly been a big-ticket item on the Right, has it??|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Because it was racist.<br>  The drawing, from famed cartoonist Sean Delonas, is rife with violent imagery and racial undertones.

Questions have to be actual questions, not rants.  When you elaborated as to why you wouldn't join other parties, it was probably perceived by someone as a rant, which is against the terms of use here on YA..  There are countless questions that are posted on here that violate the community guidelines, but many of them aren't deleted because nobody reports them.  Even a question as innocent as "what do you think of these baby names?" is technically against YA guidelines.|`|npA75Obvaa	Same thing happened to me, but it gave me the impression yahoo was protecting Conservatives.|`|zlmnfFpYaa	It's not Yahoo, it's the ultra-sensitive liberal types who take offense and report anything that doesn't warrant their approval.

J70iEDBhaa	Umm what makes you think Obama is any different? 80% of his administration are from Bush's regime. And besides.. We are not a democracy or a dictatorship. It is an oligarchy.. Rule by a few elite men at the top. Now I have a question. Why do people think Obama is going to do anything good? Hes taken back most of his campaign promises, hes followed in Bush's footsteps in almost everything... Yet people are so distracted by his speechs (which werent even written by him!) and they dont even pay attention to his policies. But hey, if anyone ever looks back at the campaign promises AFTER presidency then its laughable.

If you thought we were in a dictatorship, you ought to think again. I spent time in Cuba: there are no stores in Cuba. None. You want to paint your house? Whoops, it is not your house, it belongs to the State...besides there are no paint stores and no internet to order anything. You have a leaking toilet? You tell the State, they will fix it.....when they get around to it. You have a choice of where to live, what to eat for meals, in Cuba there is no choice, you eat what the government gives you and live in what hovel the State orders you to live in. You work doing what the government says your job is, what the government decided you were to do when you were born. You have no choice in what clothes you wear, the government gives you clothes, there are no stores to buy clothes, food, anything. You want to drive a car? The State does not think you need a car, so you cannot get one. You want to watch TV? There are only government channels, then the electricity is turned off at 8:00 PM because the government wants you to go to bed...the power is cut all over the island, so what can you do? Nothing, if you complain, it is off to jail, never to be seen again. That is true dictatorship. You have no idea how well off you are and are listening to harpies who want you to vote for them. This has been ongoing since the US was created, each party vilifying the other to get you to vote for them. It will never stop, just please do not listen to them!!!

AA12332649	It depends on whether it was a city ordinance charge or a state statute ticket.  Certain tickets are delegated to county/city governments (all are zero point infractions bearing a fine), others are infractions under state laws (points or no points).  The statute of limitations refers to the period of time in which charges must be brought against the defendant.  The officer must submit the ticket within the statute of limitations.  Regularly, officers submit the ticket within the same day, so this satisfies the SOL.  Should you ignore the ticket, and your court date, a judgment could be entered against you in your absence (in absentia).  A warrant would be issued for your arrest (called SCOFLAW in PA).  The warrant has no statute of limitations.  If your SCOFLAW fines are high enough, the officer can arrest you and take you to prison.  You must post bail in the amount of 10% of your outstanding fines and fees.  Outstanding SCOFLAW shows up on criminal background checks as well.  Unlike other information on a PA record, SCOFLAW will fall off your record as soon as it is taken care of (without a record expungement).<br>  <br>  A parking ticket is a different situation.  This has to do with a city ordinance and it is a civil fine.  In these cases, the city rarely takes the ticket to court.  They request that you pay the fine directly to the authority and they attempt a collection themselves.  The city has a 7 year SOL on the ticket (action in assumpsit).  If they fail to sue you for the ticket within 7 years, the SOL runs and they must cease collection, otherwise they could be liable under the FDCA.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to fight the ticket.  Go to court.  If you loose, immediately check to see if there is a court reporter or other recording of the events.  If there is not, you can appeal the case to commonwealth court.  Because an appeal must include a record of the trial proceedings you will get a second trial known as a de novo trial.  This is necessary to establish a record (you can appeal your case all the way to the Supreme Court, but they would probably dismiss your case).  They may require you to post a refundable bond in the value of your ticket.  If the police officer fails to show up for the second trial, you will be found not guilty because this is a violation of your 6th amendment right to confront witnesses in open court.  Depending on your county, the officer may or may not have to show up personally for your first trial as well.  Also, it is often the case that a district attorney will prosecute your traffic case in commonwealth court.<br>  <br>  In Philadelphia, about 50% of the traffic tickets in commonwealth court are dismissed, giving a great incentive to appeal any ticket there.  All it costs you is time.<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  Amy, your reading of the statute is not entirely correct.<br>  First, it applies to judgments after a plea<br>  Second, it applies to individuals who are able to pay the fine, but willfully do not.<br>  <br>  If someone is unable to pay the fine, they can not be imprisoned; it is a violation of our 14th Amendment right to Equal Protection.  Our Supreme Court has said so.  See Tate v. Short 401 U.S. 395 (1971).  Pennsylvania adopted the Supreme Court ruling in Tate v. Short to apply to the statute you named above back in 1985 in the case Commonwealth v. Hoover, 343 Pa.Super. 372.<br>  <br>  Also, In Re Davis 954 A.2d 118 (2007) requires a hearing to determine if the defendant is able to pay the fine.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	As in how long you can let it go before they can't charge you anymore?<br>  <br>  Um, I regret to tell you that according to the PA Crimes Code and Vehicle Law Handbook, Title 75, Part V, under Administration and Enforcement, section 6504 - Inability to pay fine and costs states:<br>  <br>  (a) order for installment of payments. - upon plea and proof that a person is unable to pay any fine and costs imposed under this title, court may, in accordance with 42 PA C.S. 9758 (relating to fine), order payment of the fine and costs in installments and shall fix the amounts, times and manner of payment.<br>  <br>  (b) Imprisonment for nonpayment - Any person who does not comply with an order entered under this section may be imprisoned for a number of days equal to one day for each $40 of the unpaid balance of the fine and costs.<br>  <br>  There's no statute of limitations on fines.  If you don't pay them, they put out a bench warrant for you and you will be arrested.  I lived in IL for a year and some city cop in PA misread a license and wrote mine down.  I got a letter stating there was a warrant out for my arrest and I had to go the District Justice office.  I called and then faxed proof that the make and model of the car wasn't the same and that I was out of state.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I don't think there's any way out of paying the fine though.

That being said, it is truly obscene that some of these business owners continue to pay themselves huge amounts, yet choose to layoff workers or only pay them an unlivable minimum wage.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	The Democrats only want to "raise" the minimum wage so they can raise more money in taxes.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Absolutely not.  Small businesses are already hurting and closing.<br>  <br>  Our minimum wage will increase anyway in July from $6.55 to $7.25 an hour.  Those who have worked their way up and received raises and now make $7.25 will not get raises.  People starting out will be making the same as them.<br>  <br>  Part of Obama's agenda includes raising the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour in the next two years as well as indexing it to inflation (is your wages indexed to inflation?).  He hasn't proposed it yet but his agenda is on his website:<br>  "As president, Obama will further raise the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour by 2011, index it to inflation and increase the Earned Income Tax Credit to make sure that full-time workers can earn a living wage..."<br>  <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/poverty/" rel="nofollow">http://www.barackobama.com/issues/povert...</a><br>  <br>  All of the people who currently are making $9.50 an hour won't get any raises due to the economy.  They will essentially be pushed back down to the bottom.  Unskilled teenagers will be making the same amount as them on their first day on a job.<br>  <br>  Minimum wage jobs are entry-level jobs.  They are not meant to support a family.  Why would anyone without any skills or experience in the workplace even consider starting a family?  Few good workers will make minimum wage for more than a year.  Companies usually give raises for good job performance after a year (many times sooner).  The only people who work at minimum wage for more than a year either do a poor job or have poor habits (like bad attendance).|`|QlrIUIfOaa	Good grief, no.  The minimum wage should be lowered, if anything.<br>  <br>  Business should be encouraged to hire as many people as possible.  Allow those who want to work to get back into the workforce.

f02313bbf6326c5b58f30cd80bc1329eaa	Whew, took a while to quit laughing! Are you serious? Well then here we go...<br>  <br>  1- He appointed three people into his cabinets that had tax problems. 2 of the people withdrew and did not go into office, even though Obama said he still supported them. Geitner, who Obama put in charge of the treasury had not paid taxes in 4 years, and now that he is in charge of the treasury he is also over the IRS. So pretty much, Obama appointed a guy to run the IRS who failed to pay the IRS. He appointed a TAX CHEAT!<br>  <br>  2- Obama promised no lobbyists in his cabinet. That was one of his big arguments for "Change". Well Obama is the candidate of 'Change" all right. He changed his mind and has appointed something like 21 lobbyists. I don't have exact numbers, but Obama is a liar if he appointed even 1.<br>  <br>  3- This idea Obama kicked around about "Transperency". Have you heard about the stimulus plan that was just passed? No one could read it, so it was not transparent. Also, lets have an exact list of who Obama has appointed to the cabinet, and what they did prior to the appointment.<br>  <br>  4- Obama lied about the contents of the stimulus package. He said no pork or pet projects, but there are many in there. The thing to save the Harvest Marsh Mouse? How is that necessary? Our economy is sucking and people are losing their houses, yet we put money towards preserving a mouse?<br>  <br>  5- Obama shut down Gitmo. THERE ARE TERRORISTS IN GITMO! A little factoid for you, in November of 2007 we released a guy from the prison in Guantanamo. The first thing he did was go to Saudi Arabia and get married. Next thing he did was run to Afghanistan and join Al Qaeda and start fighting Americans. Here is the shocker though, apparently he got married because he had to according to some rules. And they suspect he had ties to Al Qaeda and that is why he was doing what he was doing.<br>  <br>  There are 5 pretty big problems. Whats that average out to... about 1 a week while he has been in office?<br>  <br>  I have a question. I am stating facts, look it up. But I get a thumbs down for answering truthfully?|`|TAYErNRkaa	Pulling a team of cabinet members is a telling process, and Obama has controlled putting his team together like a boat that lost it's rudder. The democrats were all over McCain, when they accused him of not properly vetting Palin. Well, guess what? There's also a vetting process for every member of your cabinet, usually BEFORE they've been appointed. OOPS!|`|ldDDqCJSaa	He got a Democrat in the White House.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Other than that he's doing fine.|`|EAA6GIIWaa	Why has he done right?|`|AA11424005	Everything.  He is a socialist, pushing the socialist agenda.  People obviously don't like it.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Mcclete22 mentioned some good points.<br>  <br>  I'll add the fact that Obama signed an executive order to send tax payer money overseas to pay for family planning and abortions to other countries.  Even if I wasn't against abortion, I would still be disgusted that this money isn't being kept here at home where we need it.<br>  <br>  To me, the worst thing that he's done is to sign the stimulus bill.  In the stimulus bill, there are parts of it that will take away my freedom to choose to keep my medical records private.  Even though I do not receive any money from the government for my medical care, it will now be mandatory that I have to give the government full access to my private medical records.  If some people want to share their private information with the government, that should be their choice.  But where's my freedom to choose to keep mine private?<br>  <br>  Now Obama has a foreclosure bill that is angering many homeowners.  I was responsible and bought an inexpensive home.  I made the choice to sign the loan.  I have cut expenses like not having cable TV, not having a cell phone, and I bought an older car.  I do all of this because times are tough (I lost my job) and making my house payment is most important.  Now Obama wants to use my tax money to pay for people who live in nicer homes that they knew they couldn't afford.  I chose to buy a small old bungalow but my taxes will fund people who live in larger homes in nicer neighborhoods.  I don't want to pay for someone else's house.  I want to pay for my own.  If someone doesn't want to pay the expenses and making the sacrifices of owning a home, then they should rent.  It seems like he is wanting to reward people for not paying their mortgages and punish those of us who have been paying our mortgages.  There are a lot of people who are renting while they're saving up to buy a house.  Why should those renters pay for someone else's house?<br>  <br>  This video of what went on in Chicago yesterday explains it well.<br>  <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=1039849853" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=10...</a>|`|hexzaIGgaa	WHAT backlash? 65% approval is hardly a backlash.

wbIEau0qaa	Auxiliaries (from Latin: auxilia = "supports") formed the standing non-citizen corps of the Roman army of the Principate (30 BC–284 AD), alongside the citizen legions. By the 2nd century, the auxilia contained the same number of infantry as the legions and in addition provided almost all the Roman army's cavalry and more specialised troops (especially light cavalry and archers). The auxilia thus represented three-fifths of Rome's regular land forces at that time. Like their legionary counterparts, auxiliary recruits were mostly volunteers, not conscripts.<br>  <br>  Auxiliary troops were mainly recruited from the peregrini, i.e. free provincial subjects of the Roman Empire who did not hold Roman citizenship and constituted the vast majority of the empire's population in the 1st and 2nd centuries (ca. 90% in the early 1st century). Auxiliaries also included some Roman citizens and probably barbarians (barbari, as the Romans called peoples located outside the Empire's borders). This was in contrast to the legions, which admitted Roman citizens only.<br>  <br>  The auxilia developed from the varied contingents of non-Italian troops, especially cavalry, that the Roman Republic used in increasing numbers to support its legions after 200 BC. The Julio-Claudian period (30 BC–68 AD) saw the transformation of these motley temporary levies into a standing corps of regiments with standardised structure, equipment and conditions of service. By the end of this period, there were no significant differences between legionaries and most auxiliaries in terms of training, or thus combat capability.<br>  <br>  Auxiliary regiments were often stationed in provinces other than the province in which they were originally raised, to increase the process of romanisation and unification of the provinces into a single empire. The regimental names of many auxiliary units persisted into the 4th century, but by then the units in question were different in size, structure, and quality from their predecessors.|`|EAA6GIIWaa	<a href="http://www.roman-empire.net/army/army.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.roman-empire.net/army/army.ht...</a><br>  <br>  that link has all you need|`|4j3CwEnLaa	Attached to today’s Fourteenth legion, as in the Roman past, is a unit of provincial auxiliaries from the lands around the mouth of the Rhine, the First Cohort of Batavians, Roman Citizens.<br>  <br>  These are often assistedby a Unit of Hamian archers from the far-distant province of Syria.<br>  <br>  From the early days of the Republic the Roman army had supplemented its strength with auxiliary (literally 'help') troops. When people think of the Roman Army there is a tendency to think of the legions themselves and to forget the considerable contribution made to the Roman war machine by the numerous auxiliary cohorts that provided vital support in a number of areas.<br>  <br>  While the Roman legions were undeniably the most effective fighting force of their age the Romans themselves had never managed to successfully develop their military forces beyond the legionary formations. Accordingly the need for cavalry, archers, slingers and so on was made good by recruiting non-Roman peoples into cohorts of 500 (quingenaria) and 1000 men (milliaria). These tended to be one of three types; light infantry, cavalry and mixed units (equitata) made up of cavalry and infantry.<br>  <br>  Auxiliary troops were levied from the conquered provinces and were named after the locality of their origination. The period of service for an auxiliary soldier was roughly 25 years after which time he could be discharged with a small gratuity and, most precious of all, a diploma conferring Roman Citizenship on himself and his heirs. For acts of bravery it was more likely that Citizenship, either for individuals, or for the unit as a whole, was awarded. Cohorts and Alae, like the Legions, could be given honorary awards such as "VICTRIX" or carry an Imperial family name.<br>  <br>  Some units for example COHORS I BATAVORVM MILLIARIA CIVIUM ROMANORUM PIA FIDELIS, or COHORS I FIDA VARDULLORUM MILLIARIA EQUITATA CIVIUM ROMANORUM could amass many titles.<br>  Auxiliary units lacked the specialised skills and equipment of the larger legions and were paid proportionately less. Moreover they tended not to be among the recipients of the large donatives handed out to the legions and the Praetorian Guard by successive emperors desperate to retain the loyalty of their troops. However, the Citizen cohorts (cohors voluntariorum civium Romanorum) thanks largely to the will of Augustus, were practically on the same pay level as the Legionaries, and in consequence their commanders bear the title of Tribunus.<br>  <br>  Stationed in small forts along the frontiers the auxiliaries were mainly used for garrison and policing duties. When major campaigns were launched against the barbarians massed beyond the empire's defences, the auxiliary cohorts would be drawn on to provide support arms for the main legionary force.<br>  <br>  Like their comrades in the legions the auxiliary troops were divided into centuries of 80-100 men commanded by a centurion. The centurions were as likely as not to be Roman citizens in the time-honored tradition of empire officers being placed in command of native troops. Such an appointment might represent a promotion from a one of the legions. It might be a direct appointment provided under the patronage of a provincial governor, or even the emperor himself. Certainly many of the centurions were drawn from the same native stock as the rank and file. Above the centurions was the commander of the quingenaria cohort - the Praefectus who was an equestrian officer. The rank of prefect was a senior one and commanded respect right across the army. The command of a cohors milliaria or civium Romanorum was usually in the form of a Tribunus. Command of an auxiliary cohort was often the reward conferred on outstanding legionary centurions who had proved deserving of independent command. Attached to today's Fourteenth legion, as in the Roman past, is a unit of provincial auxiliaries from the lands around the mouth of the Rhine, the First Cohort of Batavians, one thousand strong, loyal and faithful citizens of Rome.

c2hfVjxgaa	You need to take up a sport or something|`|g2GSdY8Aaa	If your going to push a conspiracy theory, try to find something better than this.|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	There'll be lots of those sorts of stories, and lots of infiltration into 9/11 truth groups, to start irrelevent debates, to cloud the water.<br>  <br>  In other words, yes.<br>  <br>  But this question may be removed, as it's not really a question, it's an opinion.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	I think a 9/11 truth investigation is the last thing on Obama's mind right now. He's exploiting this economic crisis to push through his socialist agenda.|`|zlmnfFpYaa	I think Obama has more to worry about at the moment than satisfying the handful of people living in their mother's basement watching reruns of the X Files while playing on mommy's computer.|`|AA11571284	Also,,,they need to investigate how the Government made Katrina to hit New Orleans....and of course how they created the tital wave in the Indian Ocean.|`|J70iEDBhaa	Obamas real name is Barry Setoro. There is alot of evidence to support this. He was actually born in Indonesia. Think about it, your obviously an educated man if you know the truth about the elite and 9/11... Obama is a puppet just like George Bush. If he doesnt follow their plan all they have to do is release his birth certificate or other proof and there goes his presidency. He then becomes the man that got busted conning America. He obviously doesnt want that to happen. Hes going to do whatever they ask him to do. Everything I see Obama do just worries me more and more. He toys with the minds of the people and it really pisses me off. Like saying he wants to close Guan Bay while passing National Emergency Centers Act or HR 645. Which authorizes the legal creation of "detainment camps" aka concentration camps.(yes legal, its been done for a long time but Bush did it illegally) 800 camps are already known so far. I moved out of America 4 months ago. I couldnt stay in a country that does the things it does to its people. I wasnt ending up in one of those camps. Im considered a domestic terrorist just because I know the truth. Ive had enough of that.|`|h51LYvCEaa	Well it is true that Obama's birth certificate might have been a fake, becasue it is rumored that he wasn't born in the U.S, however noone knows if it really is true. We hope it isnt.

K1iUzewyaa	yeah.. that sucks. He's an a hole. And you should have called the cops on him when he got hostile.. The cut was evident on his face, and you could not really prove he head butted you.. which sucks, and they are going to go with evidence before anything. Your best option would be to bump this loser out of your life. You need to get sole custody of your kid, if you know the kid is better off with you than him. If the kid is better off with him, let it go. But get your kid and hit the road. If he refuses to give you the kid, get a lawyer to guide you through the process. I believe, as long as the mother is off drugs, etc, that the mother should get sole custody of her child. But since you hit him it may get complicating.

rtsfPQqMaa	Of the countries that criminalize Holocaust denial, most (Austria, Germany, and Romania) were among the perpetrators of the Holocaust, and many of these also ban other elements associated with Nazism, such as Nazi symbols. Switzerland, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Sweden, France and Australia have similar laws, but their legal system is based more on judge interpretations than a people's jury.<br>  <br>  Additionally, scholars have pointed out that countries that specifically ban Holocaust denial generally have legal systems that limit speech in other ways, such as banning hate speech. Countries with free speech rights in place, such as the US and Britain do not prosecute Holocaust Deniers unless the platform they use provoke civil disturbances and hate crimes.<br>  <br>  Some Examples:<br>  <br>  French Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson was found guilty in Pairs of defamation and incitement to racial hatred in 1981.<br>  <br>  In Germany an individual was found guilty (which later became the Auschwitzluge, or "Auschwitz-Lie" Law), when a Jewish student whose grandfather was killed in Auschwitz sued for an injunction when a sign was posted proclaiming the Holocaust was a "Zionist swindle."<br>  <br>  Propaganda publisher Ernst Zündel who is one of the most out spoken and least racially subtle denier, was detained by U.S. local police and deported to Canada, where he was detained for two years on a Security Certificate for being a foreign national alleged to be a threat to national security pending a court decision on the validity of the certificate. Once the certificate was upheld and Zündel was determined to be a national security risk he was deported to Germany and tried in the state court of Mannheim on outstanding charges of incitement for Holocaust denial dating from the early 1990s. On February 15, 2007, he was convicted and sentenced to the maximum term of five years in prison.<br>  In addition in 1988 he was found guilty by a jury of his peers and<br>  sentenced to nine months in prison. His appeal was heard by a three<br>  judge panel of the Ontario Court of Appeal in September 1989.<br>  <br>  By far the most famous of the deniers David Irving has had numerous legal troubles; The governments of Canada, Austria, Germany and Australia have barred Irving from entering their countries. He has been convicted of defaming the memory of the dead in Germany and has lost civil suits in England and the United States. His most significant legal battle ended unsuccessfully in April 2000 when a British court ruled that American historian Deborah Lipstadt had not libeled Irving when she called him a Holocaust denier. <br>  <br>  Consistent with British libel law, Irving was ordered to pay the legal fees incurred by the defense, which amounted to nearly 2 million pounds. An initial payment equivalent of $250,000 was ordered following Irving’s protests that he faced bankruptcy and that he planned to appeal. On July 20, 2001, an appeals court denied his request for a new trial.<br>  <br>  In February 2006 David Irving was convicted by an Austrian jury of violating that country's law prohibiting the denial or minimization of crimes committed by Nazis, in connection with two speeches Irving had made there in 1989, in which he had denied the Holocaust.  He was sentenced to three years in prison.
AA11206283	EEOC.Gov will have the forms<br>  <br>  Filing a Charge of Employment Discrimination<br>  Note: Federal employees or applicants for Federal employment should see Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.<br>  <br>  Who Can File a Charge of Discrimination?<br>  Any individual who believes that his or her employment rights have been violated may file a charge of discrimination with EEOC. <br>  In addition, an individual, organization, or agency may file a charge on behalf of another person in order to protect the aggrieved person's identity. <br>  How Is a Charge of Discrimination Filed?<br>  When filing a charge with EEOC, you may be asked to fill out an intake questionnaire that may be submitted by mail or in person at the nearest EEOC office. (Note: Our online questionnaire will be unavailable each week for up to 30 minutes, Saturday evening or Sunday morning.) An intake questionnaire or other correspondence can constitute a charge under the statutes we enforce if it contains all the information required by EEOC regulations governing the contents of a charge and constitutes a clear request for the agency to act.  See: <br>  Memorandum: August 13, 2007 - Timely Notification to Respondents of Receipt of Intake Questionnaires or other Correspondence Constituting Charges <br>  Memorandum: February 21, 2002 - Notifying Respondents of Receipt of Mail Charges <br>  Individuals who need an accommodation in order to file a charge (e.g., sign language interpreter, print materials in an accessible format) should inform the EEOC field office so appropriate arrangements can be made. <br>  Federal employees or applicants for employment should see Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing. <br>  What Information Must Be Provided to File a Charge?<br>  The complaining party's name, address, and telephone number; <br>  The name, address, and telephone number of the respondent employer, employment agency, or union that is alleged to have discriminated, and number of employees (or union members), if known; <br>  A short description of the alleged violation (the event that caused the complaining party to believe that his or her rights were violated); and <br>  The date(s) of the alleged violation(s). <br>  Federal employees or applicants for employment should see Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing. <br>  What Are the Time Limits for Filing a Charge of Discrimination?<br>  All laws enforced by EEOC, except the Equal Pay Act, require filing a charge with EEOC before a private lawsuit may be filed in court. There are strict time limits within which charges must be filed:<br>  <br>  A charge must be filed with EEOC within 180 days from the date of the alleged violation, in order to protect the charging party's rights. <br>  This 180-day filing deadline is extended to 300 days if the charge also is covered by a state or local anti-discrimination law. For ADEA charges, only state laws extend the filing limit to 300 days. <br>  These time limits do not apply to claims under the Equal Pay Act, because under that Act persons do not have to first file a charge with EEOC in order to have the right to go to court. However, since many EPA claims also raise Title VII sex discrimination issues, it may be advisable to file charges under both laws within the time limits indicated. <br>  To protect legal rights, it is always best to contact EEOC promptly when discrimination is suspected. <br>  Federal employees or applicants for employment should see Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing. <br>  What Agency Handles a Charge that is also Covered by State or Local Law?<br>  Many states and localities have anti-discrimination laws and agencies responsible for enforcing those laws. EEOC refers to these agencies as "Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs)." Through the use of "work sharing agreements," EEOC and the FEPAs avoid duplication of effort while at the same time ensuring that a charging party's rights are protected under both federal and state law.<br>  <br>  If a charge is filed with a FEPA and is also covered by federal law, the FEPA "dual files" the charge with EEOC to protect federal rights. The charge usually will be retained by the FEPA for handling. <br>  If a charge is filed with EEOC and also is covered by state or local law, EEOC "dual files" the charge with the state or local FEPA, but ordinarily retains the charge for handling. <br>  How Is a Charge Filed for Discrimination Outside the United States?<br>  U.S.-based companies that employ U.S. citizens outside the United States or its territories are covered under EEO laws, with certain exceptions. An individual alleging an EEO violation outside the U.S. should file a charge with the district office closest to his or her employer's headquarters. However, if you are unsure where to file, you may file a charge with any EEOC office.<br>  <br>  For answers to common questions about how EEO laws apply to multinational employers, please see:<br>  <br>  The Equal Employment Opportunity Responsibilities of Multinational Employers <br>  Employee Rights When Working for Multinational Employers <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  This page was last modified on December 20, 2007.|`|Nd1rrhgPaa	in Minnesota U can go to the DHS or the court house to file that

If there are 100`s or 1000`s of immigrants who are willing to do the same job for $8.00 an hour, the company I want to work for would rather hire 2 immigrants at $8.00 an hour than me at $16.00, even though the fair market wage for that job IS $16.00 an hour. I can`t compete and therefore the wages for that job have been "supressed" due to the availability of "cheap labor!" Hope this helps.

Proving a negative (i.e., that you did NOT say it) or at least calling into question the veracity of the 3 who claim you did will require that you garner witnesses at the same dinner who will testify that they did NOT hear you say it, or through some other manner impeach the testimony of those who testified (show their credibility is weak; are they drug users? criminals? otherwise of questionable integrity?)|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Its not hearsay if they are claiming you said it to them. You said they claim they heard you say this directly, hearsay involves a 3rd party. Like I heard from so and so that you said...  That is hearsay.  It`ll be pretty hard to disprove 3 "ear" witnesses of you saying this.  Do you have any witnesses that were there and can confirm your side of the story?  Medical records don't prove that you didn't say that.  You still could have said it and could have been lying about it, medical records wont help you with that.

DTNlqnOEaa	Fires fall into three types.....<br>  <br>  Accidental, where some one made a mistake, and it resulted in a fire. Those are usually easy to identify, as the people involved are  willing to say " I made a mistake and I caused the fire ".<br>  <br>  The second type is caused by natural events, such as lightning strikes, or ice storms that bring down electrical wires, that start a fire. Or mice chewing on the wires  in a house, and the wires eventually short out and a fire ensues.<br>  <br>  The crime of arson is divided into a number of types, depending on the motive of the person who set the fire.<br>  <br>  A fire may be set to cover up a crime, such as burglary, or even murder.<br>  <br>  It may be set to get revenge, or to profit from insurance payments on the building or it's contents. <br>  <br>   It may be done by a person who is mentally ill, who is a "fire bug " who gets sexual pleasure from the fire and the feelings of powerfulness that they experience, from setting fires. <br>  <br>  Some fires are easy to classify, as being accidental. Deliberately set fires may be easy to spot, by the simple and basic method that was used, and some fires, set  by those with more knowledge, may be hard to see as being a arson case.<br>  <br>  The use of timers and accelerators, such as gasoline, or naptha, or parrafin, are all signs of the deliberately set fire. If a fire has more than one place of origin , it is all most all ways a arson case. Multiple starting points indicate that  a fire that was set,  and was not an accidental fire.<br>  <br>  The use of gasoline will leave a specific type of burn markings , and in many cases, the sniffer dog will go right to that spot, based on the concentration of the solvent  being used. A further forensic clue can be findung the remains of a timer, or even just a book of matches, that was used as a primitive timer device.<br>  <br>  Very sophisticated criminals are now using cell phones to trigger fires, that they have set up, from  remote long distance locations. A VCR  can also be used as a timer, with up to 14 days of lead time, before the fire starts.<br>  <br>  Jim B. Toronto.
OKKfyLnlaa	I went to jury duty in the large city where I lived at the time and actually enjoyed it, but I also received full pay by my employer for those two weeks, and I know not everyone did.<br>  <br>  On the first day, they called about 200 of us into a large room where a TV screen counted down the amount of cases being seen that day.  It usually started with 70 cases, both civil and criminal, but most of those would settle as the day progressed.  As a case came up that actually went to trial, they would randomly draw your name and you would troop off to jury selection with your group. I brought a book and sat and read the whole time which was a nice change from work!  I got called be on three juries, but after questioning by the lawyers, I only got on the last case.  It was a three day long domestic violence case, and I found it very satisfying at the end when we convicted the guy.  After that case, they basically told me they would call me if they needed me more the next week, but since I had been on a jury, they most likely would not be calling me back, and they never did.  <br>  <br>  I think it is a person's civic duty to go and respond truthfully to the questions the lawyers pose.  It is insightful, and gives you an idea how the courts operate.  I met some nice people, and you get time off from work. The courts are generally finished by four or five in the afternoon, sometimes earlier.  If you like to read, it is perfect.  I joked with my husband I would love to be a professional juror.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	As a former juror myself, it was basically one or two days out of work.

Here in Ohio we call the night before and they tell us whether or not to come down.  Most of the time it is no....and if you are usually you go home.  I have been on jury duty 6 times and NEVER got a case and I only  made one trip to the court house.  <br>  <br>  I had it over Christmas week.  I knew that wasn't going anywhere!<br>  <br>  Please take your civic duties seriously.  ONly when we are part of something do we make it work.  You do not want people who are not worthy to be on a jury if it was you would you?  You would want a good representation of people and not just what was available.<br>  <br>  This is why voting doesn't work well.  MOST do not care ...but want to ***** when it is isn't right.|`|v0596BTeaa	If you are in the UK they will write and tell you where to go, when to attend, etc.  From then you just follow instructions.  You might not actually be chosen to be on the jury, and in that case you will just be sent home.  If you are at work, or have young, dependent children then you can say that you can't find anybody to mind your children, or your employer can write to the court and explain that they cannot spare you for jury duty.  However, if everybody tried to duck out of jury duty then judicial systems would fail, so I would say, do your duty!|`|qlO6UZZyaa	Show up for your civic responsibility. Answer questions honestly when asked, they will be sure to reject you, if you display the attitude you show here.<br>  Then you can brag to your friends about the experience and your ability to get away with it.<br>  The next time you are called, report that it will be a work place hardship for you to accept your duty. They will ignore you in the future, and juries won't be burdened by your presence.|`|2a7b3faf6505448786d487a1efedc8aaaa	It sucks. Most of the time, you show up and waste an entire day doing nothing. I mean absolutely nothing.<br>  <br>  If you're lucky, they're actually looking to seat a jury and you might get to answer a few questions for the lawyers for a few minutes. If you're EXTREMELY lucky, you'll get to sit on a jury and actually do something.<br>  <br>  However, most of the time, it's just one, long boring day. Bring a book or crossword puzzles or something to keep yourself entertained.<br>  <br>  You can lie and get out of it, but, if you're caught, you'll be in big trouble. And, you'll just get called again. Eventually, you'll have to go, so just get it over with.<br>  <br>  In most states, they'll "pay" you for your time and travel expenses. Don't get excited.

I'm 18, married with a one year old. We live with my inlaws because we can't afford to move out on our own. My husband works at a god awful factory job, 12 hrs a day, 5-6 days a week while i'v been going to school fulltime. And from what they have been telling him, they might start doing layoffs soon. . He looked into the military but has really bad asthma. So now I'm joining. My dad's been in airforce for 23 years and his dads been in for 20. So we are pretty used to the lifestyle. <br>  <br>  I was pretty skeptical at first too. But the more I thought about it, the more it started sounding like a good idea. It's a stable job, with a garunteed paycheck. Our own home and an oppurtunity to still go to school. Plus my husband can go to school as well. The hours won't be that bad and you will get to see your kids. You will have to go through the 8 weeks of basic and it's possible you won't get to see them during tech. But when you finally do get to see them, you are going to be able to offer them soo much more. That was hard for me to get pass to, was the months in tech school that I might not get to see my little girl. But I'm doing this for her becuase I want to be able to provide for her better than I can now. It's not as scary as it sounds. There's going to be negatives to it but you have to look at what you got and what the military can offer you. Then go from there. Whats the better choice? <br>  <br>  And don't worry about baisc.. It's all a mind game. :)|`|IHC5F8RDaa	if u join air force, army or navy as an officer then u would get 55 to 60,000 as ur pay and it would have 10, 000 rupees tax only. after 7 years ur pay may shoot up to 85, 000.<br>  <br>  i advise u to join air force. as pay is highest in air force.<br>  <br>  <br>  ALONG WID PAY government provides many other facilities like hospital, police, ration, daily milk & bread for free and much more.<br>  <br>  u will have high standard of living in air force.<br>  <br>  <br>  My dad is in air force.<br>  <br>  our life is damn good..|`|QIfYooomaa	That's up to you, I do know that now more than ever people are looking at the Military since it seems to be the only stable place of employment.<br>  You will be able to see your kids, not during basic but when you're stateside it's just like any other job. <br>  You do run the risk of deployment or tours out to sea but it's a choice you have to make, is it worth it to you.|`|tIWfRbELaa	I'm 24 also am married and have 1 kid. I lost my civilian job about 1 week ago, and we are fine for money till the end of the month. For a living for the that 5 years I have been doing IT Help Desk and Network administration. I have been looking for something for the last 4 months sending out 2 or 3 resumes every day and have only gotten 1 response. My wife is very anti-military but that is the only option I see that is open to us. I am going to join the AF so that I can at least take care of my son even if she does end up leaving me. So in my experience yes it is worth it if you can get a good job and get shipped quickly.

iMy46j9laa	I think it is so wrong how the older people in our country are treated. They have worked hard all their lives and paid their dues and look how they are treated.  They should not have to pay for their insurance which comes out of their checks. I would like to see the president, congress, etc... to live off of what someone on SS makes.|`|wFK2vVyHaa	If the overpayment was not their fault and they cannot afford to repay the money, they should request a waiver.|`|7UFta5tcaa	I feel for them. I to am now retired simply because I am now disabled. So I get my big check of 900.00 a month. Every one says "well you should have saved money" I did, I lost all of mine in 2001, and was off work for two years. This is a great country, they just want to throw older people to the curb. My mother who is still alive, gets 347.00 I f it were not for sis, she would certainly be gone. By the way I have a house payment of 1162.00 a month. I have enough for one more payment. Who is going to help me-No one. So I see my time coming to a close.|`|AA11928155	I'm sorry that happened to your folks. It's not fair. My husband died when i was 42 and the bank took our vehicle put a lien on the house. I had to sell everything we ever had to pay the bank. He was a 100%disabled vet. The bank took everything. Now I have to help them out? Plus I'm on SSD I get 800.00 a month and was told as of june I have to pay 100.00 dollars out to cover my medical plus I have to pay a co-pay. So I'm gonna try to live on about 650.00 a month. in my brothers garage. Something about being the widow of a vet and the mom of a disabled vet living in a garage on 600.00 bucks that just don't set right. But at least I don't own the bank anything.|`|xIowgWL7aa	Are your parents truly disabled and unable to work? I know that people are often required to be recertified by their doctors in order to continue receiving SSI. There are a lot of people who successfully manage to manipulate the system and if the government is finally starting to crack down, then so be it.<br>  <br>  Your parents might want to consider hiring a lawyer who specializes in social security and fight this or else, just pay it back. There must have been a good reason why the government is asking for its money back and they should find out why and how come.

Most of them are basing their opinion on image alone, they don't really understand, nor do they care, what the man's plans for the US are or what the issues in the US are.   They will like him alot less, just like the Europe is starting to feel, when he tanks the US economy completely.  Canada is much more dependent on the US than the US is on Canada.  We go down, they go down.  And when they go down their first reaction will be to blame the US and the US President.   Wait for it.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I really could not care less what Canadians think of Obama. Obama has not instituted any policies favorable to Canada. I fail to see this dependence you speak of between our two countries. What does Canada provide to the United States which would be deemed a dire necessity? Good relations between countries are always preferable, but your praise of Obama sounds more like hero worship because it lacks any substance on which to base it at this point.|`|2oO36b0maa	LOL  Thanks for the laugh.

Obama is not asking much to create 3 million jobs in 4 years he is actually hoping we don't understand that he is doing the worst job since Jimmy Carter!|`|9wrMpXRyaa	Impossible to answer.<br>  <br>  It would be the same as claiming diplomacy has reduced a tangible  number of people killed in wars.

All those people saying No they would never do that and they already had says they answer based on politics and not researching or looking just No they wouldn't ever do that plus no news coverage of it by major new media; wonder if a Republican had done that when Reagan or either of the Bush's were elected if it would have made the news?  I do not think it will pass Congress and really believe it would not ever get the approval of the states but they have already started trying to do it again.  I was incorrect it is a NY Dem; for the "where's the link or proof?" it is below from the House of Representaives site.|`|9PAavWnyaa	Some people have suggested that the Constitution be amended to allow more than two terms. Bill Clinton is supportive of such an amendment. Even before Obama was sworn in there was talk of changing the Constitution so he could "President for life", I suppose. People can be absurd. At any rate, a change to the existing Amendment would require too many states (38) to support it and it just ain't gonna happen.|`|NTBbZ7ITaa	do you mean H.J.

Do you seriously believe it would all be done by the generosity of rich capitalists?  At what point does patriotism outweigh profit?

What I can tell you about that man is his "nice guy act" that comes across on TV ... is completely true. I have met Norm Coleman at the DMV, he is a worm. Pawlenty would wipe out Obama in 2012 because he is very serious about what he says. In a time when the whole world is going to crap, he keeps us (Minnesotans) safe.

yvPA8FSsaa	It is Liberal double-talk.  The Democrats forced banks to make bad loans.  This is a fact.  But the banks actually lent the money so.....see what I mean?<br>  <br>  Do you know how much a trillion is?

Its not the loan that is difficult to repay, its the interest. by the time you've serviced the debt for a few years, you would have paid the loan several times over and still owe the blood-suckers.

But that to would have liberals blaming our school system for that.|`|3a082722cea27ba378a88a859b07202daa	It is complicated but in most cases it was a series of events and the banks had a good idea there would be foreclosures but at the time they were just going to profit from it.  Government encouraged development away from the center cities where most of the work was that is the first way government was planning poorly, Gas doubled in price in a Short period, people never take into account the household cost of fuel when you live an hour from your work. They were late on a payment Bush ask the banks to be lenient but the banks thought profit and risk. When the banks had investors calling in the insurance because we created no confidence the banks were over extended and could not pay foreign investors. The house of cards was going to fall. Then the banks said that they would need a bail out to stabilize the market a lie really because they should have worked it out. It is just not the people that made the loans fault|`|3caq6SFxaa	Because the term personal responsibility does not exist in their vocabulary.  People who took out those mortgages because they had a cheap rate to start with but knew it would increase and thought they could refinance or sell that before it happened are not home buyers but tried to be an investor with the house they bought.  I bought fixed rate, bought what I could afford actually less then I could afford, and bought a home to stay in long term (meaning more then 3 to 5 years) but I am supposed to help the people who chose to take the chance and lost?  The talk of making companies refinance and lower the principle to the current value (write off part of the debt) is even worse-if the house goes up in value will they be allowed to increase the principle to make up the money they lost or if my house goes up in value will they be able to increase my loan by that much?  Of course not that would help the greedy banks and we just want to help people who thought to make a fast buck or take advantage of the system-those people need to be rewarded.  This whole thing is just buying votes and rewarding bad behavior.  The house next to me is foreclosed on and my house value goes down-so what this is my home first and an investment second so I lose nothing if the value goes down exact paper money because it is an investment but if I don't sell I do not lose ash and if I think it is an investment primarily and just a house-then it is like the stock market and you should repay people who lost "money" or value there also.  Their is a difference between people who bought a home and people buying a house and the difference is the home people bought a long term place to live and raise a family while the person buying a house was investing money to make money and too many of the second group is who we are helping.  The home buyers who bought figuring they could refinance before the adjustable went up rather then finance with fixed rate-you took a chance and lost and again it was a personal choice and your responsibility so why would the nation be responsible for bailing you out?  If you  couldn't afford it with a fixed rate loan payment then you could have bought smaller or less expensive and buying at 90 to 100 percent of your loan value means you are walking a very tight line and took the chance you would make it-again personal choice and personal responsibility.|`|AA10284358	you really don't expect the dems to take any blame do you?

If the banks want to take on taking back the houses let them. they won't get as much for them and hey people go rent. let the Albatross go.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	The simple answer to your question is because as long as they can skirt the blame on to the big bad predatory financial institutions, than the irresponsible americans who bought home loans with an adjustable rate mortgage they knew they couldn't afford if rates were to go up, can continue to play the victims and hold their hands out for a gov't rescue.  Dems like to keep the poor poor and reliant on the gov't.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Most people are just not that stupid but the government (as a whole) is relying on those who refuse to take their blinders off and see beyond the lies.<br>  <br>  Blame the banks, blame the Dem's, blame the Rep, blame wall street, blame everyone but the government.

For example, the single mother of 2 who made $35,000 a year and was approved for a variable rate mortgage of $275,000.<br>  <br>  Shame on the bank. Dumb move on her part for signing the papers.<br>  <br>  I agree.... people need to be responsible for their own actions. But the banks, driven by greed for fees, are partially to blame for this mess. They should have never given out high-risk loans to those who could never afford to repay them.|`|QGBSOpt7aa	I agree with you 100%...<br>  <br>  I don't understand how the bank is responsible for telling someone what they can and cant afford.  the bank says, "If you borrow this $200,000, at this interest rate, your payments will be X dollars a month."  it is up to the borrower to know if they can afford X or not.  What, should the bank ask them to bring in their cable bill, phone bill, food bill, various expense documentation and then figure out what they can and cant afford.  <br>  <br>  Look, I'm pissed off about this whole mortgage bail out thing.  I think it is BS that just because I pay my mortgage on time every month because I was smart enough to a. not take out a loan I couldn't afford the payments to, and B. was smart enough to realize, hey, if I want to pay X per month, and don't want that cost to go up, maybe I should have a fixed APR, I don't feel I should be punished through higher taxes to pay for some ignoramus who decided that even though they brought home $2500/month, they could afford a $2000/month mortgage.  <br>  <br>  Be responsible for your actions!!! dont expect the gov't, and those people who are responsible to bail you out all the time.|`|oLxKV2OCaa	Because it's the bank's job to manage everyone's money.<br>  <br>  Yes if I don't pay back my $1000 loan then I'm guilty for that $1000.<br>  <br>  Banking allows for a certain percentage of unpaid loans.<br>  <br>  It's up to the bank to ensure they are generating enough interest to cover the unpaid loans.|`|yViX0rLxaa	That is more agreeable to their welfare base of voters who they hope will let them stay in power in 2010...They are beginning to see that AMERICANS MEAN Business--and we're not going to stand for this money grab--without voting OUT ALL THOSE WHO VOTED for it--and now they want stupid voters to believe it was the banks--Colonel Mustard in the Dining Room with the Candlestick--?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  When have banks ever done the moral or right thing? SIMON Legree--remember him? The banks did it so they could steal the land and home--out from under folks--and get it for a song--criminals--nothing more..<br>  <br>  We may be gullible--but the American Voters are not morons...<br>  <br>  UNSEAT CONGRESS HOUSE members who voted to throw America in the trash!!|`|5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	In alot of cases, banks were making loans to people they shouldn't have.  in those cases it's the banks own damn fault.  Would you lend $1000 to someone you knew couldn't pay you back?<br>  <br>  However, people who just don't pay their loans and have the money shouldn't be getting any assitance.  Please provide a link to where any one in the democratic party said they should.|`|0hSpsSByaa	The problem is that the banks were encouraging people to take out bad loans, including giving easily payable teaser rates, and then when the payments escalated people couldn't pay.  Also, a lot of banks were  having fees stacked on that people shouldn't have had to pay, payments were credited late even though paid timely and then demands made for late charges and interest on late charges, etc., and that was just the tip of the ice berg.  Not to mention, a lot of people were making their payments until the economy fell apart and they lost their jobs and at best could find  much lower paying jobs. These facts are just the tip of the iceberg. In other words, you are trying to reduce a very complicated situation to a very simple answer and it isn't accurate.|`|oojO4WAraa	I'd pick E = none of the above.  <br>  <br>  Both the lender and the borrower are at fault here.  The bank should not have made loans that the borrower was not qualified for, and the borrower should not have borrowed more than they could afford.  <br>  <br>  There is plenty of blame to go around.  <br>  <br>  I am a democrat - and I don't think like you are saying.  Generalizations are bad and don't accomplish anything.  They create division.  Stop it!!|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Because justification and rationalization mean you don't have to take responsibility for your own actions.

I'll believe him and take the medicine.<br>  b. he's a doctor and wants to rob me and for me to die a horrible painful death.  I won't take the medicine.<br>  <br>  Banks are in the loan business.  If someone couldn't pay off a loan, they should be the ones who would figure it out.  Instead, they gave loans to people that almost certainly couldn't pay them back.  If you're a first time home owner, and a banker guy tells you you can afford this loan, and you'll be able to pay it back, you believe him cause he's a banker and loans are his business.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	The banks that extend loans have been doing it for 10,000 years.<br>  <br>  They know perfectly well how to read a credit report and determine accurately out of 100 loans what percentage of those loans will be paid back and the attached risk factor. That's how they determine interest rates, loan availability etc..<br>  <br>  Okay cool so far..<br>  <br>  Where the banks screwed the country was on two points.<br>  <br>  First there was a rash of unqualified loan specialists popping up around the country between 02' and 05'.. All these work from home jobs refinancing loans.. They jammed in all these balloon interest rates sometimes not being totally honest with the new refinancing terms..<br>  That was step one.<br>  <br>  Next came wall street taking subprime loans and categorizing them as A1 instruments.. This means they were taking risky investments (the loans themselves) and reselling them on the derivatives market.<br>  Because of the (false) high rating mutual funds which include pensions and 401k's picked them up. Shortly after risky investments did what they always do - and fluctuated in value. It is that fluctuation which has caused the loss of savings and investor trust.<br>  <br>  So who's to blame?<br>  The SEC for allowing such instruments to be sold on the derivatives market under false pretenses? Was it Clinton for removing the government imposed ban on derivatives in the first place? Or was it the investment geniuses who were able to sell basically junk loans at an inflated value due to a false categorization???<br>  <br>  My point is homeowners refinancing their loans are predictable.<br>  Everyone knew how much they make and their credit history. <br>  There was no subterfuge or hidden truth at that point in this process.<br>  <br>  I wish it was as simple as gee that neighbor of mine couldn't pay back his loan. But really it's even more complicated than i just described. I didn't even get into the global market factors...<br>  <br>  Have a nice day!

You can see OBAMAS attempts at agitiation everytime he opens his mouth hes always pointing the finger of blame at anyone that stands in his way.

Your nephew should have been receiving support from both parents from the time he was born.<br>  <br>  If you had legal custody, then the Judge would have taken care of all of this.  As things are now, you must petition the Court for custody.  Hire a lawyer immediately!!! Without legal custody, you do not have the right to make any choice for him, including medical decisions.  This child needs to be in the legal custody and control of a legal guardian.  <br>  <br>  Child support is the right of every child. Whether or not parents want it or not, they do not have the legal right to waive support.  That can only be done by a Judge, not a parent or guardian.<br>  <br>  As your sister is not caring for him, she is also required to pay child support.  <br>  <br>  All you know about your nephew's father is what your sister told you, and since you have admitted her mental capacity, it may not be true.  Your nephew's father may not know of his existence and he not only has the right to know him, he legally has the right to try to raise him.  You must go before a Judge to have this little boy taken care of.  The legal mess you are in must be cleaned up.
Hq6nSl1Qaa	As George W Bush said in 2001 (to paraphrase), the best way to be patriotic in a time of economic crisis is to go out and shop, buy, and borrow.<br>  <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0929-04.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/...</a><br>  <br>  While that statement was poo-poo'd by liberals, it is widely true.  Our greatest weakness is when our economy doesn't work, when our economy is stagnant.  America has only enjoyed world economic dominance since WWII, a brief 60 years.  Much of that was fueled by construction and making things.  The situation we face is dire because we aren't building a whole lot.  The situation is desperate because we don't make as many things as we used to, and we are hemorrhaging our wealth through massive trade deficits.<br>  <br>  The calculus today is very different than what it was - even 8 years ago.  If the government gave a tax credit of $500 for every person, much of that money would go to the countries that make things for us with primarily minimal retention for the low-wage workers employed to complete the transaction process.  The echos of W. Bush's rebate plan showed that pointedly.  So I can't say that I'm a big fan of $13/week when over 5,000,000 are unemployed.<br>  <br>  So the misguided solution proposed by conservatives and nay-sayers is to accelerate the race to the bottom.  "Let the Big 3 go bankrupt." "So what if someone else loses their home - I'm responsible." "You can't introduce preferences to buy American in any bill."  Stunning.<br>  <br>  The more time we spend finger pointing and "responsibility" talk, the more damage is done to the heart of our economic engine.  We can talk blame... about how real estate investments that didn't pan out are part of the sub-prime mess, how mortgage companies failed fiduciary responsibility to verify income, about complex mortgage securitization schemes that understated investment risk, about changes in the law that allowed banks to expose themselves to instability through questionable investing, about the first time home owner who couldn't make their mortgage because interest rates doubled in two years when their 2/1 ARM reset...<br>  <br>  George Washington despised the idea of a party-based political system.  I agree with him in that R, D, C, I, or whatever label you prescribe to yourself, should always come second.  America is first.  Instead we have Limbaugh saying he hopes that Obama fails.  We have 9 trillion dollars in cash being withheld from investment.  We have leadership more interested in sniping politics than figuring this out.  No one will ever destroy America, we will destroy ourselves.<br>  <br>  My company provides services to government and private entities engaging in environmental and geotechnical work.  Our city has major bridges in such decay that trucks and buses can't cross them and have to divert 3 miles to go around on the next bridge.  We have roads that need to be repaved.  We have schools in structural neglect.  <br>  <br>  When this funding hits our state (as we are already preparing for because we are good capitalists), we'll be able to employ people at a livable wage.  The contractors that aren't working because of the 13-month inventory on homes, will be put to work and stop drawing unemployment - so they can stay in their home.  I'll keep my job, so I can stay in my home.  All this work will improve America and the long term investments required to do good business.  It will help with keeping families in their home and not further contribute to the mess.  That seems to me like a good thing.<br>  <br>  There is no way that the federal government, regardless of party leadership, can do this alone.  It won't happen... just like CPR alone won't save someone having a heart attack.  But it will help bridge the (I hope deeply) temporary gap between the peak of instability and when those sitting on the sideline feel "warm and fuzzy" enough start putting that 9 trillion dollars back to work.  And all this b*tching and moaning from both parties isn't inspiring any confidence.<br>  <br>  So, I think we should bring back G. W.'s ideas and go shopping, spend, and borrow so that our heart doesn't start deflationary decay.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	This is the Democrats baby orca all the way.

The problem with this is, those only provide temporary jobs, and also...if people don't have a lot of money, they are not going to be spending it on tourism or expensive trips to the zoo.<br>  <br>  Also, the housing market really needs to stabilize for things to improve in the long run.<br>  <br>  I'm half and half...I just feel like this package only offers a temporary solution.  Investors and traders forecast what's going to happen in the long run, and that's what partly drives the market up or down.  If they feel insecure or that this package is only a band-aid, they are not going to be willing to take the necessary risks which help establish a bull market.|`|7130dcb06a591c8850f1c6de810da84aaa	If your horse is sick, it's the only horse you have, and some government official says the solution is to shoot the horse I guess you would just pretend it was the right solution.

It is just this is highly publicised because of her media coverage.

He and his wife may be friends with JK rowling- but he should remember this is a democracy and politics and friendships should be separate. That fell flat as it now  transpires that he has not solved child poverty- an issue Rowling was so keen to praise him for. Of course he's relying on those with no mind of their own to no doubt see his supporting Jade Goody as his ability to save the world, find a cure for cancer (or was getting cancer drugs a postcode lottery under Labour?) and show him to be a man of the bankers- i mean people.

And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything." <br>  -- September 18, 1858 - Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois<br>  <a href="http://www.topicsites.com/abraham-lincoln/quotes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.topicsites.com/abraham-lincol...</a><br>  America takes all of the brunt of slavery when actually slavery began thousands of years before it came to the USA.<br>  <br>  Slavery existed for centuries before the first slaves came to America. Old Egyptian, Greeks, and Romans owned the slaves. In Africa there were many kingdoms and slavery was legal. When Europeans came to Africa, slavery there already existed. <br>  <br>  The first European slave traders were from Portugal. The little country of Portugal built the first European fort in Africa in 1481. It was called Fort Elmina.<br>  Although many people think that most slaves were stolen or caught by slave traders, this is not the truth. Most slaves were bought by Europeans from other African people. Often, rival tribes sold into slavery members of other tribes they captured during wars.  Most of the slaves came from the West Africa and spoke many different languages. <br>  <a href="http://www.seanbryson.com/articles/black_slave_traders.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.seanbryson.com/articles/black...</a><br>  By Tunde Obadina/African<br>  <a href="http://www.afbis.com/analysis/slave.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.afbis.com/analysis/slave.htm</a><br>  I do NOT apologize for slavery that was done by American Ancestors.<br>  I don't accept responsibility for their inability to come out better than because of .  <br>  The bottom line is if you want to sit back and take it that's your business, but, if you want him Eric Holder to know you dislike being called a coward the here is the link to do so.<br>  <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/contact-us.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usdoj.gov/contact-us.html</a><br>  <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/CR0212661/id19.htm" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/CR0212661/...</a><br>  *********************Suggestion*******...<br>  Learn the history of slavery before being critical of a entire nation.|`|BI5H7shlaa	i can remember cascius clay(muhamid ali) he had a valid point when he said that black people and white people should not live together,i believe he was right,i do not like black people and do wish they would leave england,or if you like britain,i do not care who calls me racist because it is true,i am,you only have to look at the shooting,and stabbings in this country now,the majority carried out by black youths,what more do we need,as against twenty years ago,our country has become a dumping ground for all the thugs other countries do not want|`|AA11907660	no i am not a coward. but one man can't fix all the bull ****!!!!! that they keep dealing out. i don't have easy but i keep fit my way through ever day.the withe man is the under dog now because we can say your anything because no one with listen. the **** need to stop. skin color dose not make a man. it's your way's (work habits,personnel believes) or drop them all.|`|7Z9U4f5paa	Hey Reg.

AA11056021	People who lose their jobs and cannot pay for thier homes are not "LOSERS.  But those who bought houses beyond thier means & those who finance the purchase are "CONS."<br>  <br>  Last year my wife lost a 35,000 job because she had to stay out from work for three months because ahe broke three bones in her left ankle.  Six months later she got a state job for 25,000.  Those were the toughist six months of our lives but we survived.  I worked my normal job and picked up side work with temporary labor agencies.  We also cut the cable, internet, cell phones and postpone trips to our families on holidays.<br>  <br>  Four years ago when we got married we bought a very small house in a very bad neihborhood because thats what we felt we could afford.  Since then we have cleaned up the neihborhood by getting rid of three tenants that sold crack and by creating a park for everyone to use.<br>  <br>  At first I was excited by Obama's plans for change because I thought that he would encourage the nation to take responsibilty for thier own actions.  I believe in community service for the greater good, but not helping out those who will not take the inititive to better thier lives themselves.<br>  <br>  People who lose thier jobs should get help, but where do you draw the line?  What about citizens like me who kept up with thier mortgage no matter what.  Should we not feel resentful that we have to pay for those who caused this mess.

Jobless claims are a faulty predictor because 2 income households still have some financial resources. <br>  <br>  That said the numbers are simple, Obama plans to keep a many as 9 million Americans from losing their homes to foreclosure, yet only 1.3 million are out of work there are still 7.7 million WORKING people who are behind. Seems buying a house bigger than ones budget is an epidemic. Or maybe the loser tag does fit!<br>  Why is there a problem in the first place?

This is a small percentage in terms of those that knowingly got in over their heads.  I know several health care professionals who are losing their homes and they make a decent wage, yet were coned by preditory lenders into loans they did not fully understand and are stuck with a payment that does not justify the means now that they are paying far more then the house is worth.

You or your employer?<br>  <br>  When a job is eliminated, whose responsibility is it to be of a skill set such that you are in demand in the market?<br>  <br>  Do people "get to" go to college and develop good skill sets or is this something that is somehow given to only the privileged and elite few?<br>  <br>  When you buy a house, is it your responsibility or the bank's responsibility to see that you are not biting off more than you can chew, even given the potential job loss of one or the other spouses (in the case of a married couple).<br>  <br>  If you make a decision to not save money so that you can pamper yourself with a certain lifestyle, why is it somebody else's fault when something unexpected happens and your world comes crashing down around you?<br>  <br>  Why is it if you make a poor real estate investment it is somebody else's responsibility to bear the loss associated with your poor decision?<br>  <br>  If somebody loses a job and has to stay "underemployed" for a while just to make ends meet, is that an appropriate choice, or should they simply not work at all in hopes of their next "big opportunity" coming along?<br>  <br>  If you choose to live beyond your means, run up credit card debt at 30% interest, and then have problems, is it somebody else's responsibility to bail you out?<br>  <br>  My point is that I believe we are all ultimately responsible for our own financial destiny.  Sure, job losses will happen and unexpected expenses will arise.  But if you make a series of poor choices in life, I am not of the opinion that it is the American taxpayers responsibility to save you from your  stupidity.<br>  <br>  If you get to a point where you lose a job and have absolutely no savings upon which to rely, then you were living beyond your means in the first place.  While children are subject to their parents immaturity when it comes to things like this.  I have a hard time automatically feeling sorry for somebody over the age of 25 who finds himself in this scenario.

So when you shoot the stimulus. No one saw behind the scenes..they saw the person who was always in the news pushing it..Obama. Now with that said the thought process is now the shot Obama (cause he was the face of the bill), then ur mind goes to..he is depicted as a monkey (chimp w.e) then you're like wow.....the main thing is...nobody put Pelosi to the bill, every newspaper was showing Obama cause even tho he didnt write it, he was its face and then Obama image sells so even if it wasnt meant to be racist...with a major black figure in politics now...it would be common sense not to use cartoons with historically racial elements in it..like the muslim jab from before or this monkey..or the chicken and grape soda and all that..yes he is open but why does it have to be something with hints of racism..like someone said..the jews wouldnt wanna be depicted as rats or the italians as mobster so just poke fun at obama but nothing with any racial ties<br>  <br>  just had to add angela is dumb...how would bush depicted as a monkey be racist? is he black?

8dc5NMexaa	Two ways for dismissal:<br>  1. All courts in all jurisdictions periodically, according to their own administrative rules, clear out files of lawsuits from the clerk's office when they have been filed, but no there is no action or activity in the file for a long period of many months (the number being decided by the particular district), by placing them on a docket set for a particular date and time called the "Dismissal for Want of Prosection Docket," and notice of the same will be given to the named litigants of such docket, and if no one appears and states any legal objections at that docket, the case will be dismissed by Order.  <br>  2. The quickest method is to file a "Motion for Non-Suit," which will be granted unless the other party has already filed some counter petition or cross-action asking for some affirmative relief from the court.  Their mere filing of an answer to your suit will not block the Order on Motion  for Non-Suit.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Laws vary.  It is unlikely that they will dismiss the filing.

Both sides are guilty of trying to pin blame on the other and both often try to justify the actions of their chosen leaders. The problem for Democrats is that they indeed complained about Republican spending incessantly during the Bush years and now try to justify even more excessive spending by pointing to that same spending. It is enough to make your head explode when dealing with them. I try to ignore as much of it as I can. I was against excessive spending under Bush and I am likewise against it under Obama.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	I was more offended by our side using the "now it is our turn to be fiscally irresponsible" argument.

iCqfmRC3aa	Our military is our last defense against terrorist and those that are against freedom. I believe we must have the best our country can offer in such roles of responsibility.  I am greatly saddened each time I learn of another of our sons or daughters being lost in defense of our way of life. So, I can not support using our military as a punishment for young offenders, who have already shown bad judgment.  In the military when you have to enter battle, you are taught to protect the man or woman next to you, in other words, the field of fire you establish is not toward those enemies in front of you, you will be firing at enemies in front of another soldier.  This creates a cross-fire or "killing zone" that is more difficult for the enemy to penetrate.  I would not be comfortable with my life depending on someone who has already shown they did not follow our laws, nor good commonsense.<br>  <br>  I believe each case is unique and each punishment should be unique, and while I'm concerned about our justice system as established, I do not believe the military to be a decent replacement.  <br>  <br>  I spent 13 years, proudly serving with the United States Marine Corps. It was not a punishment, it was a privilege.  The vast majority of our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen would agree that they are proud of their service to our country.|`|d744df703c1bbfc38519fcf12e361265aa	What many people fail to realize is that most youthful offenders are heavily involved in drug and alcohol use and/or gang-violence, and many of them have pretty severe mental health issues. The military is not the place to deal with most of those problems.  <br>  <br>  Our military is not a residential treatment facility for at-risk youth. To send them there would simply lower morale for those who volunteered for service out of a sense of duty, honor, and pride... which would be harmful to the military as a whole.  See what the draft did to morale during VietNam?  This would be no different.|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	NO!!<br>  <br>  It costs the government so much money to train up a new recruit, when they could spend less leaving them to the judicial system. <br>  <br>  And it's more than that. I personally would not want someone of a "questionable character" watching my back in a combat situation. If I can't trust them not to steal my gear, or not to shiv me, why would I trust them in combat? <br>  <br>  What about the wives and husbands of serving members left at home, I bet they'd find it real comforting to know their partners are out there with convicted criminals.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	No that isn't fair.  Why should we train people who can't function in everyday society.  There is a reason the military is voluntary if they wanted to come in they had the opportunity.|`|hexzaIGgaa	No, the criminal justice system is the place for such people, not the military. The military is a place of honor. Prison is a place for offenders.<br>  <br>  If your little heart bleeds for these youthful scumbags, I have a great idea...hire them as baby sitters for your kids. Don't flog their sorry butts off on the military.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	This worked well for many years. It was common practice up until the end of Vietnam war. Then due to the civilian population's attitude to the military it became to be considered cruel and unusual punishment. Also with the advent of the all volunteer military those who had really volunteered did not really want jail bunnies serving along side them. <br>  <br>  I think now that it is time for a change back to the old ways.|`|G6yyceAxaa	No,<br>  <br>  reasons:<br>  <br>  the Army and all the military operate off of discipline. if you lack it, there is no middle ground, you will be punished.<br>  <br>  people that break laws lack discipline, and to that point will not be able to do the fundamentals of the military. basically they will end up going to jail or getting kicked out.<br>  <br>  Discipline is taught at home, and if a person grows up undisciplined, it takes lots of very intense training to get them to change the way they think.<br>  <br>  A person with no discipline feels that it is ok to break into someones home because they are broke and have no money.  it is something they are comfortable with, and that is anattitude that will take lots of intense training to change.<br>  <br>  I often hear the argument or statement about sending all the murders and bad people to go fight, well, they would get killed, because they won't work as a team, they are selfish and self centered, and to operate in the military you have to have teamwork.|`|2fd55f14f3a0438dea1a8b90b1409e79aa	The army is not a day care facility, what youthful offenders need are two parents.....sorry the nanny-state (government) does not do a good job, by the time a youthful offender is sentenced for a crime, more than likely they have several more crimes under their belt...<br>  <br>  these youthful offenders have had their whole lifetime to develop their "skills", eight to ten weeks in boot camp will not fix that...|`|67ThRN4Taa	No.<br>  <br>  I spent three years in the army from '76 to '79 (and then 21 years in the army reserve).

It has become increasingly evident that the blame for our current problems go all the way back to the insane conservative economic policies introduced by saint Ronald Reagan and continued by every administration,including Clinton, ever since. The failure of "trickle down" economics was that it did NOT keep middle class wages high enough to support a real economy. The loosening of credit was used as a way of keeping the economy afloat.The plan could not work forever and the bill came due. Greenspan the bubble-maker just could not create any more.Couple that to unfair trade agreements which resulted in a large number of manufacturing jobs leaving our borders,and a lack of regulations on wall street resulting in GREED. and you can see that conservatism going back almost thirty years is the reason that things are going bad.Your claim that two years of a slight Democratic majority (a notion that you get from the A.M.radio propaganda specialists) could bring about this mess are incompetent,irrelevant and immaterial.|`|LTS3GCpQaa	That little re write of history is a product of partisan propaganda <br>  <br>   The money system you have been using has been corrupt for close to 100 yrs and fatally flawed -- It has exloded because it was designed to explode <br>  <br>  Bush telling Americans that the economy was fundamentally sound was one of his biggest lies -- yes even bigger that the constant threats of mushroom clouds from Iraq <br>  <br>   Banks lend money on a 9 to 1 ratio and have actually been creating false money by this formula since the early 1900's <br>  <br>   The money system was stolen after a manipulated crash in 1913 which wouldn't have been hard because corruption was already rampant <br>  <br>   ----------------<br>  <br>   This has nothing to do with the partisan politics you want to play <br>  <br>   After the banking industry was taken over their sights were placed on the government and once that was purchased one member at a time the government set about purchasing other governments and bombing the ones that would take the bribes <br>  <br>   You are going down in the same fashion Rome did because your behaving the same way Rome did|`|AA12212403	I understand but they will never understand.<br>  We have fundamental differences in our basic beliefs and understanding, obviously.<br>  I will vote for candidates in primaries that offer a moderate position in the future, and whoever my party puts forth in the end.

LJwhaNIDaa	Yes, in a New York minute. <br>  <br>  It is reassuring to see that a prominent citizen with name recognition is finally speaking out forcefully against Obama's spending plan.  I hope others follow suit and also become a loud voice of reason.  <br>  <br>  Obama's plan rewards and encourages irresponsible behavior.  It is destroying the morale of all the responsible people. <br>  <br>  92 percent of home owners are still paying their mortgages.  These responsible homeowner's are the backbone of our nation and they are the ones who will keep it strong. <br>  <br>  I am okay with the banks refinancing high adjustable rates to lower fixed rates, or renegotiating a longer mortgage term to help lower monthly payments. <br>  <br>  I am solidly opposed to lowering the value of the house, which is essentially forgiving part of the loan,  And, I am against rewarding those in the program for paying their mortgages on time.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to the Santelli video.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZB4taSEoA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZB4taSE...</a>|`|0bca92964b851ca1b2f27db7faf7f57baa	You bet!

It certainly has the higher power in Y!A.<br>  <br>  Here is irony /be sure to open the link and see who owns this.<br>  Cut and paste below the link<br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/freedom-of-speech" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/freedom-of-...</a><br>  <br>  Liberty to express opinions and ideas without hindrance, and especially without fear of punishment. Despite the constitutional guarantee of free speech in the United States, legal systems have not treated freedom of speech as absolute. Among the more obvious restrictions on the freedom to say just what one likes where one likes are laws regulating incitement, sedition, defamation, slander and libel, blasphemy, the expression of racial hatred, and conspiracy. The liberal tradition has generally defended freedom of the sort of speech which does not violate others' rights or lead to predictable and avoidable harm, but it has been fierce in that defence because a free interchange of ideas is seen as an essential ingredient of democracy and resistance to tyranny, and as an important agent of improvement. The distinction between an action falling under the description of speech and one which does not is not clear cut, because many non-verbal actions can be seen as making a statement—for example, burning a flag or destroying a symbol. Again, valued freedom of speech embraces publication—writing, broadcasting, distributing recordings—as well as oral delivery of ideas.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	The 1st Amendment does not apply to a corporation.

There are also many ultra-rich globalists who are flaming liberals, who are at this moment, working toward a global government.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	No, it isn't true.|`|KaLd1J0Xaa	If you put "votes" at the end of each phrase they may be correct but as stated they are lies that the left would have you to believe.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	More like Democrats vote for entitlement programs and Republicans (and more so Libertarians) vote for personal responsibility... <br>  <br>  <br>  I am a Republican and I am charitable to the poor when I have the means to do so... I would rather do it on my own that do it by force... I am more apt to give more if I can do by myself... besides, I am a big girl now, I can do things myself... I don't need mommy and daddy government to tell me what to do... :/<br>  <br>  <br>  Really Unka... then how do you explain Pelosi, Frank, Edwards, Clinton, Gore and Kennedy... I am pretty sure that they are working to make THEMSELVES richer and not their constituants... and they are all Democrat... :/<br>  <br>  And I (as a Republican/Libertarian) have a BIG problem with government bailing out the people that are responsible for this mess... from the overacheiving, greedy bankers right down to the people that took the loans that they couldn't afford... :/ Why not help the people that play by the rules, instead.... but no, we have to help those that feel they are entitled to things and don't have to work their butt off... As Ben Franklin said, "The U. S. Constitution doesn't guarantee happiness, only the pursuit of it."<br>  <br>  And another ideal of Ben Franklin is that we need to quit making people comfortable in their poverty and give them the means to get out of it.... and I agree with him wholeheartedly.|`|zftm6qkKaa	If you're heartless about others vote republican. BTW, either party is for wealth, it's just that democrats don't pursue it at others expense and misery.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	I am reporting you.<br>  <br>  You are going to cause heads to explode.|`|006931ab45dbadcbf10afb1e4dea8726aa	Actually, the premise of your question is inaccurate.<br>  <br>  Neither party is "for" one group or the other, they both have an interest in maintaining the status quo.  Since the trends for the past few decades has been the rich get richer and the poor get poorer which ever party you vote for is for the rich.<br>  <br>  The GOP party line is to allow capitalism to run rampant and all the good things in life will somehow trickle down to the lower classes.<br>  <br>  The Dems line is to maintain the lower classes in a controlled environment so that capitalism can run rampant.<br>  <br>  The whole bickering thing between the two parties ideologies is just a distraction to keep folks like you and me busy so we don't cause any trouble.|`|8fc8f123f06a174dff895e68b99d24e3aa	This is not true but it may have been so at one time.<br>  <br>  Corporate America long ago banded together politically to have a greater influence on the political landscape. Their intentions may have been to see to it that laws passed favored the growth of business. This may have enriched the CEO's but was at the expense of the working class. The working class found collective strength in unions.<br>  <br>  Today the working class aligns itself with the Democrat party. I personally think their allegience is misguided. Democrat party leaders learned a long time ago that they had more power and control when they created a society dependant on government. By keeping the poor poor and powerless, the ruling elites have more power and, with that, more money flowing into their bank accounts from parties seeking their favor. <br>  <br>  The answer to your question as to which party you sould vote for to be rich is "non of the above." If you want to be rich, do like my grandparents showed me by their example...get up every day and go to work and work hard for the boss when you do go to work, save some money from every paycheck, further your education, have children only when you can afford them. Notice you can do these things no matter who is in political office.<br>  <br>  The problem we have in this country today is too many people looking to government to get ahead instead of looking to themselves. Look to yourself. Pelosi doesn't care about you. All you are to her is a vote.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	That's a gross exaggeration but it's true reading both parties doctrines that Democrats represent the labor class while Republicans represent the ruling class. At least that's what they say....<br>  <br>  Uhm just so you know - getting rich is a bi-partisan activity.<br>  <br>  What's your point? The rich and super rich are better than the poor and middle class? I disagree. A financial hierarchy is the nature of capitalism.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	What an absolute false statement.<br>  <br>  The truly wealthy don't give a crap about labels such as republican or democrat.   They will donate to both campaigns in order to gain favor with the winner, regardless of who it is.<br>  <br>  Both sides use fear tactics on the poor.|`|AA10284358	wait awhile you will know the answer.You all know since obama is now among the rich he will want to keep it that way. He got wealthy in a very short time with his middle east buddies and the dippy hollywood air heads|`|vuDE5TPbaa	Republicans want to keep the rich, rich.<br>  Democrats are FOR the poor, and thus don't want to keep them poor.<br>  Vote Democrat.|`|WB7sFVxAaa	i've seen many Democratic political signs with this slogan "Too Poor To Vote Republican"<br>  <br>  <br>  read into that whatever you want|`|ab4b7f2780a98b6eb4a78dc77e22c800aa	A true misconception.  Dems are responsible for enabling people to be and stay poor. (its good for election time)|`|ZM44vYPbaa	It matters on what type of career you have and how much you work but generally I would say Democrat. Republicans are all for Capitalism which makes it so workers get paid very low cause the owners and managers control how much they are paid, The wages are low for many jobs to pay the managers, owners and CEO's outrageous amounts, plus celebrities and athletes are allowed to make so many millions of dollars they don't know what to do with it. Democrats are more for socialism, which is kind of the 'Robin Hood' philosophy of take from the rich to give to the needy. Therefore if you plan to be a movie star or own a business you should vote republican, and if you plan to work anything else like most americans do vote democrat.
c2hfVjxgaa	Ah, mediamatters as a source.  It is better to not cite a liberal source than to cite it and remove all doubt.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Well, because Rush was right and Obama was wrong. Over the last 20 years I've owned two houses as residences and currently own three houses as investment properties. After owning the first property for 20 years I made a little over 150% on the first house. My second house, bought about 8 years ago, is worth about 25% more today then when I bought it and notice, we're in a market decline. My rental properties, bought during the height of the housing bubble are still estimated to be slightly more than what I paid for them. When the economy turns around and the market with it, they will begin to appreciate nicely. <br>  <br>  Housing has always appreciated well, on average about 5% a year over the long term. That means it takes about 4 years, on average, to appreciate 20%. Now, granted, I'm not expecting something like that, but in my experience, Obama's opinion speaks, again to either his total lack of experience in business or his intentional misrepresentation of the facts. <br>  <br>  But you keep listening to him as it is obvious you know no better.<br>  <br>  And please. Get over Rush.|`|AA10284358	your point? If you don't like Rush the don't like him but he only tells it like it is and thats hard of your democrats ears. Slam him all you want but it doesn't change anything. You all call him a druggie. so he had a problem  and took care of it. If you are going to talk about his problem them add Obama to the list. He admitted to using crack and cigarettes which i suspect he still does. Tobacco is a addicting too you know. You will disagree with everything he says if you are democrat so give us your point of the question.|`|c1566a746196b29f9589775543f6928caa	Rush is right.  Obama is talking down the economy.  He called it a crisis 25 times.  Never in the history of the United States have we heard so much doom and gloom come out of the presidents mouth.  Will Obama go down in history as the doom and gloom president?|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	He did misspeak in saying lifetime instead of a year..I get it, but I also am getting sick and tired of all the gloom that Obama is speaking..I realize we need to know that the economy is bad right now but geezz give us a little hope.|`|fT15YEkFaa	yes limbaugh has lost his mind from drug abuse, he was funny & smart in 1988 but he's just a babbling gas bag now|`|Ocyrox5baa	Big deal.  Rush doesn't write and sign bills into action.   We need to focus on what obama  and the other dems are doing and saying.  Let's stay focused on what's important.  Ah, that would be change.<br>  <br>  Obama made a larger fool of himself in appointing Geitner to be in charge of Treasury, when TG admitted he tried to blow off the rest of his tax liability because he could get away with it in terms of statute of liability.|`|Fy54FMemaa	This is great! And isn't it funny how Rush supports are so far up his *** that they downplay this mistake.... this is an obvious representation that they will believe anything this man has to say, even when the proof is in front of their face that he is wrong (as it is all the time). This is a great example of why Rush and all his dimwitted followers are a bunch of empty barrels.|`|VymTflp3aa	"Bad New"  as a name?  geezzzzzzz........how much cool aid do you drink every day?

VUgCSQ6Daa	A thinly veiled attempt at gun control. Bad idea.|`|9PoGLVmXaa	Just another attempt by the liberals to do away with the 2nd Amendment without repealing it (which they know they can't do).|`|SlhuFfuZaa	I know a few ways to make O baa ma more transparent!<br>  <br>  Crap like this is why my weapons are not registered and never will be. Also I have some that I can make my own ammo for and if need be I will do this. It may require a little testing to get the formulas correct but  know how.<br>  My weapons will only be taken from me after I am no longer in possession of blood flowing freely in my veins.|`|OQdPzl15aa	The funny thing is, even if there comes a day where guns are completely outlawed or have such crazy laws that makes it really hard to own one, two things are going to happen.<br>  <br>  1) No more hunting except with a bow; which could lead to increased elk/deer population since not many hunters like bow hunting<br>  <br>  2) The rate of murders will still be the same, since humans are the ones who kill....guns are just one of thousands of way to hurt someone.  If someone really wants to kill you, they are going to find a way. (There may be less accidental injuries caused by guns, but face it. How many people a year are really injured due to an accident with a gun? Not that many.  People are more likely to suffer accidental injuries while driving, slipping in the shower, cooking or even owning a pet.  Are they also going to make us have million dollar insurance on our vehicles and...well, cooking utensils?)<br>  <br>  Jacking up the price of gun insurance in case someone gets hurt, is just a "sneaky" way to get guns out of people's hands...but it isn't going to solve much in the way of murders. Check the statistics on leading causes of death or accidental injuries.....guns are certainly not at the top of the list. And a long as it is our American right to own personal arms, I think this insurance plan would be illegal....because you can't put limits that tight on personal rights.  You can't say "you have the freedom of speech, but only if you pay me a million dollars a word" or "you have the freedom to practice whatever religion you want, but only if you give me a million dollars every time you go to church."<br>  <br>  I agree that there need to be certain laws put into effect to help regulate the type of people who own guns as well as type of guns purchased....you know, so someone who has been convicted of murder shouldn't be allowed to ever own a gun if they ever get released, and no one should be able to buy a machine gun on a whim....but overall, guns for recreation or personal protection should remain in the rights of all Americans, as was the original guarantee in the amendments to our Constitution.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	That was the IL bill .<br>  <br>  The NRA is going to fight it. <br>  <br>  It was brought out that IL has the largest murder rats around, and they have a gun ban. HMM makes you think what would happen if it was a level playing field.|`|g2GSdY8Aaa	He and his followers are deviant by nature, they still feel that "guns kill people" and as long as there is that type of disconnect from reality, we will always have to remain vigilant.|`|NTBbZ7ITaa	Only cowards who like to be herded like sheep.<br>  <br>  "Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch,<br>  Liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote"<br>  _Benjamin Franklin|`|SjTAVdcKaa	No, I DONT agree. Just stay away from my guns. Registration, gun checks. OK. They can be dangerous things, like cars. But keeping guns out of law-abiding citizens is more dangerous.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	Maybe all of the gun owners and hunters who actually voted for him can answer that question.

I think it's downright wrong to limit gun ownership like that. Guns don't kill people, people do.

He got as much money as he could before telling bush the truth about how bad fannie and freddie was and he was't alone in that.Doesn't matter how much you want to throw it back on bush , it still goes back to the democrats. all the harping on bush does not explain the mistakes the democrats are making now.Like the china situation you like to blame that on Bush but that goes back to bill clinton. He bragged about balancing the budgit but what he didn't say with who's money.Obama thinks he doing such a good job of helping peole with forclosures but it will be a bust because to keep their homes they have to come up with big money just to get applications and all the process they have to go through.Most of them won't be able to keep their houses anyway.Their houses aren't woth half of what they paid for them and the banks aren't accepting the price they can sell for. The people that will benefit are the rich that can gobble up the houses for pocket change.So all it will amount to is still the rich get richer the poor get poorer.Unemployment is getting higher so people will lose their houses anyway.So what's generalizing it's just the way it is.|`|8T1eMJAHaa	actually there's not a whole lot of difference in Dem, Republican pols most are spend happy crooks and freaks. now the real people they represent cover the entire spectrum and a lot have misplaced loyalties.

But if they chose to take the full 12 weeks he would have to save their position for the worker with benefits intact or he'd have to provide a position of equal pay and equal benefits upon their return.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	yes you fly on your dime.   just the same as if you took any other kind of leave you you pay for it.  the military does not pay to move you around.  same as the guys on R & R coming out of the middle east,,,,,the government doesnt pay for it,,,,the servicemember does.  it is YOUR choice to go/travel,,,your choice to pay for it.  i have never heard of the military paying for you to take leave.  all the times my husband traveled on leave We paid for it.

This question really upsets me. It upsets me A LOT. Obama INHERITED a huge mess when he came in as President. He's been President for less than a month, and ppl are jumping all over him. You have to remember that the President is not the King of America. He can't just make decisions and enforce them. The President can PROPOSE things, but the house has to support his decision, and they have the power to veto his ideas right out the window. And one thing Obama HAS done, is he's appointed member of the opposite party in to the house. Rather than flooding it with strictly democrats, he's leveled it out. Obviously these senators and such agree with his proposal. Look around you, the State of California is paying for that twit who has 16 kids! We already pay out the ***! And you know something else? You can't just waltz in and get welfare. My father just lost his job, laid off. My stepmother had a heartattack. They're about to lose their home, and GUESS WHAT?? They weren't accepted for Welfare. Oh, how very righteous of you to say "work for money" but it's really NOT that easy. It's SO DIFFICULT to find a job, and you can't always control things. Oh-one more thing. You're limited to the time you can be on Welfare and you have to demonstrate why you need it. And if Welfare is such a great free ride, why are there so many homeless ppl on the streets begging for money?<br>  Bush ****** up too. Every president has. Don't jump all over Obama because BUSH got us in to this mess. He's desperately trying to get us out. Good God, at least the man is trying-not sitting on his *** and butching.<br>  Enjoy your pregnancy, be thankful you can afford this baby, and can sit on your computer on Y!

My husband is from England and while I was there I got to receive FREE healthcare.  That's right.  FREE.  <br>  <br>  I honestly am excited if he can get free healthcare going.  The fact that our government is allowing the American people "they claim" to love so dear and are always there to lend a helping hand, DIE.  Just because you can't pay over 400,000 on a cancer treatment.   That is uncalled for.<br>  <br>  What kind of government does that?  Ours!   I never realized how brainwashed I was on paying for health.   They have the same care as us over in England.  Yes, there are pros and cons to everything, but why would someone complain to have free healthcare with the same coverage!   People are brainwashed into thinking it will become a third world country.  It won't!  Don't you know we are ALREADY paying for medical.  Where's it going?  Why pay it if we don't get any use out of it.  Explain that one.  Now, that doesn't make any sense?   <br>  <br>  We have been paying medical for YEARS.   They just now introduced Medicaid in 1999.   Makes you think.   In England the money you pay on taxes.  (like we do believe it or not!)  goes towards free healthcare.  No one is judged and no one has to pay.<br>  <br>  Now, yes.  Food stamps and other welfare related where the government gives you money for sitting on you ***.  Yeah, that's wrong, but everyone deserves the right to free healthcare.  No one deserves to die because they don't have enough money to pay!  It's wrong and the American people are seduced into thinking we are SUPPOSED to pay.  We shouldn't have to.  It's not our fault we are sick.  After meeting my husband and visiting England.  I definitely have a whole entirely different opinion on our current healthcare.|`|DY9NOh4taa	It is the usual rhetoric that candidates use when they are campaigning for office.<br>  They employ an opinion research company to conduct a survey in the area where the candidate will be going in a couple of days, they take those results and the speech writer, writes the candidates speech. That is how a candidate knows what the particular issues are for a given area. Obama himself doesn't know what he is going to talk about until he receives his speech to go over it before the rally. <br>  A big misconception is that people think that the government can provide them with free health insurance, and there is no way, that insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and doctors, will allow government to take over the health industry.<br>  Whats to say if the government did control health-care, and a person needed an operation that cost $250,000, and they decide to deny it because they don't feel that the person would benefit from it.

So out of that 52million Obama voters lets say about 45million are democrats the rest are independents and at this point out of the people that voted for Obama only 38% agree with the stimulus bill so that # is now down to about 20million that actually disagree with republicans on this bill, with a number that small we can safely say those are the extreme left who have no problem with KNOWN terrorist being affiliated with your president so if you approve of a terrorist then you must be one.if you are against terrorism then HONESTLY ask yourself ,how can you be ok with THE FACT that Obama is friends with a KNOWN and ADMITTED TERRORIST?|`|U50orfPhaa	There is not 60 Million people that are far left loons!

He won't violate the 2nd Amendment - he will just make it impossible to own a gun through regulations, penalties, and bogus 'guidelines'.  There is talk about a bill in the Illinois congress where a million dollar insurance policy will be mandated for anyone who owns a gun.  In order to keep your mandatory permit, you will be forced to buy an insurance policy.  First of all, the cost would be outrageous.  Secondly, there are no insurance companies offering this type of policy.  Thirdly, if insurance companies start offering such a policy, they would be completely under government control and would enact stipulations that would prevent anyone from buying the policy anyway.  See where this is going?  Just like the Fairness Doctrine - Obama will be against it and will not violate the 1st or 2nd Amendment, but will 'back-door' both of them to take our freedoms away.

He did give lip service to the latest (third dating back to 1870's) saying it is an individual right but then appointed an Attorney General who said the Supreme Court did not say that and people misunderstood that.  President Obama has a very long history going back to his activities prior to entering politics, his time in the IL state legislature and his short Senate time as not supporting the Second Amendment as an individual right-actually was a sponsor in IL of a bill to enact an almost exact copy of the DC ban as a state law.  Until he can replace conservative Supreme Court justices with "his people" he can either approach it from registration, fees and taxes (bill already introduced primarily HR 45) and just make it too expensive to own or shoot, re-instating the "assault rifle" ban and expanding it (something he has already said he plans to do through Executive Order despite the "assault rifles" aer used less then knives in crime).  Once he can stack the Supreme Court through either replacement or pull an FDR and increase the numbers of SCJ;s, he will nibble that way but when/if he gets the Court he wants he will then reopen a case and have them rule his way.  I rust him to do exactly what he has promised to do and been trying to do all the way up until he figured his view would cost him Presidential votes.  His view of gun ownership was well established prior to his change to moderate believer in the Second Amendment and accidentally voiced when he lost PA to Hilliary Clinton who won because of white people running to guns and religion.  Itrust him to be what he has always been and do not trust his current and recently acquired views at all which means I do not trust him in this area at all.|`|LnWOSedEaa	Obama is a classic double talking politician who has his own agenda of which is coming together very well.  To really know what he thinks of the 2nd amendment just look at his attorney general.  Search his history under the Clinton's.  Freedom to Obama looks more like freedom of the govt to do whatever it wants to.  Also, since when do political cartoonists have to apologize for their cartoons?  Looks like we are headed toward something very evil.  Don't be surprised that we have changes in freedom of speech first.  If you take away the public's right to say what we feel, then that leads to a round up of freedom of speech supporters.  Hummmm, looks like socialism to me.  But what do I know, I am a vet, a southerner, and white lol, that already labels me to the liberals.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	His record offers no solace to anyone who believes in the right to keep and bare arms.  His own statement to his "Core" constituents in San Francisco, when he thought no one was listening, insults these 2 premises: Guns and Religion.<br>  Last time I checked, he alleges himself to be a Christian but criticizes fellow Christians who have not been as fortunate as him.<br>  <br>  Seems to me that he is criticizing one of America's most basic freedoms, in the right to believe what you want!  And he is jealous of guns because he wants people to "Cling" to him and his every word, voluntarily or not.|`|QlzFoBS3aa	Yes I trust Obama, he won the election, I voted for him too.<br>  So get over it!<br>  Deal with it!<br>  And it's that redneck mentality of yours that voted to keep a Texas Idiot in office for 8 years too.<br>  Speaking of freedom:  It's those republicans that are all about believing that it's their duty to SHOVE their bad beliefs down EVERY-ONES throat, even though we want nothing to do with them......That is NOT Freedom.. deary|`|e5229cd398fab1a52d67a832b2db54c1aa	Yes - He's the president and all good Americans need to put their hatred and prejudices aside and trust the fairly elected President!<br>  <br>  Heck - we all stayed quiet while george w. bush destroyed our credibility with the world, and told one lie after the other to the American people and to the U.N.<br>  <br>  .|`|5e5c5c1cfde2ffcdb16e4ce17d31b558aa	I do not trust, nor do I have much faith in the manner Comrade President Obama is governing our great country.|`|f624b66aaed0290aaf76eedf3378ad4caa	No--Hell no.|`|j8zY1KCIaa	NOPE!|`|yB0fWb1Uaa	Nope not at all!|`|AA10284358	no . he's very scary|`|JuL1jGS8aa	No!

She may be here with a valid visa, making her a legal alien.<br>  If her visa has expired she may be in paperwork to make her a legal resident.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of red tape that makes these procedures slow... I'm sure the immigration office is backed up just like child protection services are etc.<br>  So on many people their visa expires BEFORE finalizing the residence papers (green card).  Yet, they still want to do the right thing and file tax returns etc.  Some of these people come here with a working visa, so they should pay taxes like everyone else, and file tax returns etc.|`|MzgPbMOvaa	They just suspended E-Verify at my work because it made it too hard for illegals to get jobs.<br>  Yay Hope for all!

xxDjV6Axaa	They will work cheaper.  And don't demand all the perks and benefits that Americans do.  But you are right, it's a disgrace what some companies are doing.  My brother was the Director of Systems Analysts for a large company.  He was told last year that 30 of his employees would lose their jobs at the end of the summer and they would be out-sourced.  These are people that worked for him for 15 years and up!  They had families and obligations.<br>  <br>  They wanted my brother to keep quiet about it so they wouldn't quit.  He refused.  He told them all so they would have a chance to look for other jobs.  Then he quit.  Since his skills are in high demand, he immediately got another job but it made him physically ill that happened to people he liked and respected.<br>  <br>  And at his new job, he asked for and got approval, to hire some of the people who lost their jobs at the other company.  And they got more money too!  Unfortunately, he could not hire all of them but it took some of the disgust out to know that at least some were better off than when they worked for the first company.|`|AA10925759	H1s will sit tight and work for less.

XsI7ISqsaa	greens, democrats, socialists, communists, social democrats. pretty much anyone|`|AA11626745	Conservatives have a sense of morality. We believe marriage is between one man and one woman. We believe that if you are born male or female, that is what you are. Abortion is murder, homosexuality is a sin. We feel people should earn their own way and that unless you have some sort of disability factor in your life (other then liberalism/laziness), you need to get off your butt and get a job. If you borrow more then you can repay, you deserve to loose it all and not have me pay for it. If you are in this country illegally, you are a criminal and should have no say in your deportation nor should you receive a driver’s license or monetary benefits. We believe that the American dream is to make something of yourself by using your own abilities and not exploiting someone else’s. We believe that our Government should be very limited and only be there to maintain civility (punish law breakers, not dictate everything we do nor provide for our every need). We believe that we are “One nation under God” and that if you don’t like it you are welcome to leave. If you get offended over our Christianity, get over it, that’s who we are. We believe we are a Christian nation founded on the morals set fourth in the Bible and grounded in the Ten Commandments regardless of what some law-breaking liberal creep activist judge says. <br>  <br>  Liberal Democrats are the opposite.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped.|`|j8zY1KCIaa	It would be the democrats because they are liberals.|`|NTBbZ7ITaa	Democrats: Experimenting with other peoples lives since the "New Deal"|`|8cLV2OPYaa	The democrat party is against conservatives generally speaking. There are a few "token" conservative democrats, but they aren't terribly relevant. Those few only identify themselves as "conservative" democrats, usually as an attempt to draw contrast between them and other democrats, and usually only stress that difference if they think it will benefit them during election time. <br>  <br>  It is the same story with Republicans. Most are conservative, but a few like to try to identify themselves as "liberal" republicans. For the most part Republicans follow a conservative ideology, and democrats follow a liberal ideology, all of whom do so with varying degrees of severity.<br>  <br>  A good example of an extreme liberal, and where liberal ideology leads is the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez. Extreme leftist, or "liberal". A good example of an extreme right wing or conservative leader would be Netanyahu from Israel.<br>  <br>  It could also be said that both American parties operate in a somewhat "clandestine" manner, with respect to their "true" ideology. In other words, they "water down" their rhetoric to appear less extreme and more mainstream to the American public. In this way they usually manage to pass many somewhat "extreme" concepts directly past the rational "center" of the country, and generally cater to extremists on either side.<br>  <br>  When you strip away the watered down rhetoric and expose both parties for what they are you are left with the following. Democrats in America today are actually rather socialist, and some actually support a significantly communist ideology much like the former Soviet Union. Some of the less extreme democrats aren't much worse than "European style" moderate socialists. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, Republicans tend to be very nationalist, and generally Imperialist, although usually not militarily so, they are supporters of a form of "economic" Imperialism that some might successfully argue, is actually largely responsible for America existing in its present position as the sole "superpower" on the planet. <br>  <br>  This does not rest easy with most democrats as they view America as a bloated, arrogant machine of old, obsolete ideas. While Republicans view democrat policies as "un-American, and reminiscent of previously failed policies embraced by other countries. They frequently accuse democrats of blaming America first for the worlds woes, which unfortunately seems to be a rather consistent position held by most democrats.<br>  <br>  Also another fairly reliable standard that separates the parties in America is religion. republicans generally support Christian agendas or ideals, while Democrats tend to embrace the secular or non-religious ideologies. Republicans tend to champion things like family values and criminal justice, while democrats tend to support things like science and environmental agendas.<br>  <br>  I am neither Republican or Democrat. I am conservative but not religiously so. I am more of a "secular" capitalist conservative. Very nationalist, with extreme capitalist and Imperialist ideologies. I say extreme only because of the contrast that my position casts on any other accepted agenda in America today. I am essentially party-less. The democrats are almost exactly opposite of my moral structure with the only exception being their support for the raw sciences, and republicans are far too weak in the capitalist arena with too much reliance on the Christian community for definition of their agenda. They are also rather wasteful of our military assets in my opinion, and often do not make maximum use of our military leverage in the world.<br>  <br>  I guess I would be a supporter of an American, secular, Imperial Party. Unfortunately it doesn't exist at this point in time, and my background is a little too "colorful" to get very far in creating the party myself. <br>  <br>  I would imagine that when Americans get significantly tired of the following 'three things" someone with an appropriate background and education will probably step up and get America on the right track. <br>  <br>  1) When they are tired of being taxed to death and have all their traditional freedoms stripped away by the democrats, in the name of "diversity" and living up to "world expectations". In addition to having our prosperity curtailed in the interest of "equalizing" the standards of living worldwide. It could be said that the democrats are the party of everyone else in the world EXCEPT Americans.<br>  <br>  2) When they are tired of having their society forced up against the Christian moral "wall". Christian social engineering is nearly as bad as democrat socialist engineering in that all that is accomplished is once again, less freedom for Americans, and less opportunity for those who do not "fit, in the national scheme. Republicans agenda relies too heavily on allowing the benefits of a strong economy "trickle" down into the lower echelons of society, where what little bit of regulation exists usually only serves to limit the upward mobility of "common" citizens,|`|GGJ8T6uYaa	Take note of how the two groups answer this question.  The liberals and Democrats attack the conservatives, while the conservatives or Republicans have been telling you what is good about conservatism.<br>  <br>  That tells me that liberals cannot really identify what's good about themselves at all.<br>  <br>  That alone should tell you what you should be - if you are a moral, altruistic person that is.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	The Republican Party tends to be Conservative.

AA10124897	It took a few years to fix the problems that Carter left the nation with in the 80's... Now we had 8 years with Bush fixing what Clinton left us... Only in the last year did the final blow happen.  He certainly tried to get ahead of the situation, however, he was blocked over and over again.  <br>  <br>  As it stands today, we are looking at several years of hard times.  It will take several years of Republican leadership to right this ship.  If we were to go into 2011, with what we have on the hill right now... The ship may never be able to be righted...

He was elected as an Acorn volunteer with eighteen (18) months experience in the senate. Thus - he had NO leadership or economic, or foreign policy EXPERIENCE.<br>  <br>  So yes, America will have to elect someone like Mitt Romney to get us out of the mess Obama is getting us into. And before anyone says he inherited it from Bush - the truth is, Bush inherited it from Clinton (again, think NAFTA).|`|iDq0PuSfaa	It will take many years of conservatism to reverse the travesty of the past few weeks.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	I hope so.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	We can only hope *sighs*|`|r3WkhpBpaa	OH I HOPE SO!!!!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	yes.

zJUXsRlGaa	Under English law, the usual way of ensuring who is to look after your child in the event of both parents dying is to have a will and in the will you would both appoint a testamentary guardian or guardians. The wording would be something like:<br>  <br>  "  In the event that I am the sole surviving parent of x (child's name) I    appoint y and z to be his testamentary guardians."<br>  <br>  I would point out that children are not treated under the law as chattels (goods), so parents can't just leave them to anyone unsuitable - it is always open to anybody who thinks the children should be with someone else to make a residence application to the Court under the Children Act. Because of this, if there is any likelihood whatsoever that anyone might object to the appointed guardians, I always ask the parents to leave an explanatory letter with the will, stating why they have chosen those particular people rather than anyone else.  The usual reason would be because the children see the chosen guardian regularly and know them, or because they are more suitable in some other way.  This gives guidance to the court and any welfare authorities, and would be an important factor to consider in any court hearing.<br>  <br>  In your particular circumstances, as you are not intending to make a will before going away, I suggest you both leave a letter appointing guardians in the event of your death.  The letter should be dated and it should be witnessed by two adults who should not be relations or the proposed guardians (even the postman would do as a witness if you can't find anyone!). The 2 witnesses should both be present in the room together and actually witness your signature. The letter should then be placed in a safe place where it can be easily found if necessary.<br>  <br>  PS MissyDoo is wrong saying godparents would be chosen in the event that you haven't appointed anyone.  They do not have any legal standing, and indeed would be unlikely to be chosen over close blood relations unless a VERY good case could be made out for them in court, which is unlikely. Godparents are not always close, and what if they are agnostic?   I was personally chosen as a godmother many years ago, and have never considered it necessary to do anything, as the parents knew of my belief on this score,  and I haven't seen my god daughter more than a few times in her life (she is now about 50) as we lost touch.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	No not just anyone could come along and take him. He would be taken to live with either your parents or your husbands parents. I think they could choose whom wanted him but if they started to fight over him then they might have to go to court and that would be a mess. just state whom you want your son to live with in the event of your death. Also i know where i live that if you legally make someone your child's god parents in the event of your death your kids would go live with the god parents. You should get a will done soon if you are that worried about dying.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	Get a solicitor to draw up a will and make provision in it for that to happen. <br>  <br>  My daughter did just that with her little boy saying that we gave her a happy childhood and she knew we would do the same for him. Thankfully it has not come to that. <br>  <br>  You do hear of some horror stories about social services  but most officers are trying to do their best for the children. like most professions you do get some right head bankers and then it all goes wrong because the managers feel they have to back their staff|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	The child welfare office will step in, but in all likelihood the child will be left with the grandparents.  Their aim is to provide the best for the child, and it is obvious the grandparents (providing they are able) are the best choice.<br>  <br>  But more seriously, MAKE A WILL!!.  It takes very little time to draw up a simple will.  There is no excuse, even on short notice, for not preparing a will.  In the will, you can set out your own wishes for your child.<br>  <br>  Problem solved.|`|WKiAISZdaa	Your husband is nearly two?|`|XPaLYdobaa	i dont want to scare you but,the Social work department would be right in there messing it all up,they would ask if your parents werent too old,and the kid would probably end up in care,will or no will.until your parents got some good legal adviser,to sort it out,take care.i saw two parentson TV at the beginning of the week,monday i think on breakfast television trying to get there three kids back after being cleared of harming them by social services,they had a bone deficiency that made their bones crack.even after a Top Judge had said there had been a miscarridge of justice,they still have to fight to get their kids,the social services say its in the best interest of the kids that they stay with the foster parents now.they always mess thing up.

kbJt4065aa	Well, you need to provide more details to get an accurate answer. <br>  I'm assuming the person being sponsored lives in their home country and is not currently residing in the US. So, I would assume that the case would be handled through consular processing. <br>  HOWEVER, I have no idea what kind of immigration case you are inquiring about. An I-130 for a spouse would be quite different from immigration through employment. An I-130 for a spouse versus a unmarried adult child is different. An I-130 for a spouse of a permanent resident is handled differently then the spouse of a citizen. There's all kinds of variables!<br>  I filed for my husband who is Canadian and who was living in Canada when I filed the I-130. We were already married and it was not a fiance visa. After we got the choice of agent form, I got the I-864 fee bill. Once I sent in the requested fee, they mailed me the I-864 form. Once I mailed that back in, then we started waiting for an interview at the Montreal US Embassy. You have to send back one piece of paperwork to get the next one. If this is an I-130 for the spouse of a citizen still living in their home country, then I would think the I-864 fee bill would be next. Start getting any evidence you need for the I-864 put together. Especially tax transcripts as they take the longest. You have to get the form back before you even get put on the list to wait for an interview. The sooner you get it back, the faster it all gets done. <br>  I believe we got our interview about 6 months after the I-864 was sent in. The rest of that paperwork probably took a couple weeks in between each one.|`|AA10258539	Please rephrase your question as it is vague. What kind of application did you file? What immigrant type are you? When did you apply? What country are you from? All these questions will determine how fast your application will be processed.|`|AA12075268	What is a choice of agent? I went through the process years ago, I have no clue what you are talking about.
vUpjOUQQaa	No doubt you are happy to take the maintenance payment every month.<br>  <br>  What you accept and what you dont is irrelevant, the rights of the child will supersede both yours and your ex's rights.<br>  <br>  Just because he jilted you does not make him a bad father , nor does it means his partner is a bad person either.<br>  <br>  Unless you can PROVE that your son is in danger or will be submitted to neglect or some such you have absolutely NO rights to refuse visitation in this matter.<br>  <br>  The father has rights to visitation , also unless you have legally granted sole parental custodial rights( being left with the child does not necessarily give you those rights) the father could be well within his rights to go for  full custody. Given that he obviously has  good means of support whereas you do not could easily put the situation in his favour.<br>  <br>  Your son has a right to know his father, the fact that you do not like his father and want to use access rights as a weapon against him will always make you look shabby and the courts do notice that sort of attitude..|`|3qGdN6xMaa	I don't understand the "with me present" part.<br>  <br>  Generally visitation should be arranged to be "one at a time" with brief meetings for exchange.<br>  <br>  It is a good idea to maintain some sort of "indirect" communication with your ex, perhaps via email or fax if you don't like to talk with him.  Also make your communication "concise"<br>  <br>  It is probably a good idea that your son remains some contact with his father, and think of your sons interest to facilitate.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	It is unfortunate but really the only rights to be considered are you son's rights. He has the right to both a mother and a father, and as long as he is not at risk, you should not try to stop that happening. Boys do need a father figure - it might make quite a difference to the way that his future unfolds to have that influence in his life. Not to do so might cause him to resent you at a later date as he almost certainly will find out that his father wanted to spend time with him and you stopped it.<br>  <br>  I know that is hard not to put your personal issues into the equation, but you have to try not to do so.|`|7yoheNkcaa	just go to the judge and tell him that i want me son i gave birth to him and i pay for him everything but my husband dosent control him

All police systems stink, so don't blame Florida more than others.  Then, for your problem, don't move in with the guy again.  It's a violent situation, and you don't deserve that.  Stay away from him, and find you an attorney to work out a custody agreement with regards to the child.  I guess I see why the cops arrested you if he was bleeding, but he should have gone, too, since you were injured.  However, look for the silver lining, if they had arrested both of you the child would have been placed in protective custody.  So, look at it that way and be glad that you both didn't go.  He clearly started it and should have gone instead of you, but like we said the police system clearly doesn't work.  You are going to have to protect yourself and your child, so get a good victim advocate and attorney and get away from this bad situation.  Good Luck!|`|C59bTKO2aa	First, you need to calm down so you can think clearly.  What's done is done, now it's time to decide about your future.  The fact that your boyfriend head butted indicates that this isn't the first time your fights turned physical.  Usually fights do escalate over time, yours will too, because you got locked up and he didn't.  So yeah, he's going to threaten to get you locked up again and he'll probably get locked up a few times himself.  You have a toxic relationship, and it isn't the cops fault.  You are not stuck in this relationship, just because you've been with him for 7 years and have a baby together, doesn't mean you can't leave.  It means that you don't want to, it takes some work to get out in such a way that you keep a roof over your head and your child cared for.  There are shelters for domestic violence victims, that will take you in, get you training, and counseling, then as you progress will get you an apartment, transportation, childcare and a job.

Is is possible that your boyfriend was the aggressor? Sure, but the physical evidence points to you. I would bet that there were no marks on your face from where he head butted you, making it hard to believe he did it in the first place. <br>  <br>  Honestly, it sounds to me like your playing the I'm a female and females are always the victim of domestic violence card. This is not true. <br>  <br>  Also, it is a very rare case when police arrest both people involved in a domestic dispute. If they arrest both people, then the person who is the victim is going to have a hard time getting help from state departments. <br>  <br>  I know it's hard to do, but you have to put yourself in the shoes of the police. You show up after a fight. Both people involved are saying its the other person that got physical, but there are only marks on the boyfriend. Both people are verbally hostile, and the story of the boyfriend fits with the physical evidence. Who do you arrest?<br>  <br>  Now, I'm not saying you are absolutely at fault. If you are the victim and your story is the truth, you will have your day in court to prove it. You had better make sure your case is tight, and dont lie.

If it is a totally illegal vehicle and poses a dangerous threat.  If it is operated in such a manner as to disturb or threaten to disturb the peace and harmony of the general public.  If it is a stolen vehicle or a vehicle otherwise obtained illegally.  there are other possible scenarios, but that's basically how I see it.  Buy the way, if you own the vehicle and only operate it on your personal property, I assume that you don't have insurance, because to insure the vehicle, it must be registered in the state that it is operated in.  So, no insurance?  that can open up a very bad can of worms.  Or if it is registered and insured, then there are plenty of instances where a police officer CAN issue a summons.  Even if it is only operated on private property.  Anyway, I've said too much and your question and my big mouth have given me a headache.  But i hope I helped.

In fact the Federal reserve until lately has gotten such little coverage most people think that it is part of the government.

SEwG8Yl4aa	Don't let the facts get in your way...<br>  <br>  in April 1939, unemployment was over 20 percent. This was nearly a decade after the 1929 crash and more than 6 years after FDR's inauguration.<br>  <br>  During that time, FDR tried everything to end the crisis: cartelizing industry (the NRA), subsidizing farmers (the AAA), creating make-work projects (the WPA), promoting organized labor (the Wagner Act), and finally, launching the modern welfare state (social security, minimum wage laws, the AFDC). It was all funded by a combination of increased debt, excise taxes, and high progressive income taxation.<br>  <br>  Yet, unemployment stayed very high throughout the entire period, declining during FDR's first term, then rising in his second term. As late as June 1939, industrial production remained significantly below 1929 levels (81 vs. 100).<br>  <br>  FAILURE!|`|xxDjV6Axaa	The war helped us recover to some extent but if you look at what was going on in the 1950s, people were still struggling quite a bit.

The Depression dragged on for 10 years, despite the New Deal.  Spending for rearmament leading up to the war was far greater than the money the government spent on the New Deal.  And there was a steep contraction in 1937-38, so it wan't like it was happy days starting with the New Deal.  Not to discount FDR.  He was also responsible for joining the war on the right side, so for that fact alone he'll always be a great president in my book.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Actually some studies now say FDR's policies actually extended the Great Depression.  What ended the Great Depression was simply put Hitler attcked Poland in 1939 and then conquered Europe-the US began manufacturing weapons and material for the British and then the Russians which began our recovery but what really ended it was Japan attacking Pearl Harbor which meant American manyfacturing had to step up even maore to produce material for the US military and we employed millions by drafting them in to the military and sending them to war.  That ended the Great Depression.  Most of the work projects during that time were not good paying jobs by any definition and even paid less then the jobs were paid prior to the start of the depression-they were for the most part manual labor, long hours and physically demanding but the jobs were better then no jobs at all.  The governent did not provide money for those projects-they were government projects and not civilian company projects.  Schools and road had very little to do with it as the main projects were based on building hydroelectric dams in the Tennessee Valley and western states, clearing national forest areas, and some schools and road were built but mainly to support the work being done because the labor was housed in camps and not at home with their family.  The people working on those projects were not well paid but were paid to work and it is actually closer to a workfare system instead of welfare.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	It created jobs for Americans.If you look at the history of why we went into depression much of the same is happening today.Stock market,loss of jobs,crop production due to weather conditions,foreclosures, etc.You cannot fix these problems by giving the taxpayer $600.00 or $400.00.We need work.We need inflation to stop eating holes in our pockets while wages stay the same.We need less illegals in our country.The list goes on and on.|`|My65doewaa	The new deal actually made the great depression worse and made it last far longer than it should have.

3caq6SFxaa	Oil is one big thing and many manufactured goods are another; look at a car information sheet and many times 30% or more of the parts come from Canada and many other manufactured items also.  We also sell a lot to Canada so in many ways it is a good trading partner.  The sort of trade you find bad is actually exactly what was set up by NAFTA and the Canadian workers are well paid and have good benefits so the reason to move it there is not huge labor savings cost.  The end run you are concerned about is for American union workers (less then 25% of the labor force) and is protectionist but for them but the big end run is to escape the govrnment regulation and corporate tax rate of the US.  The red herring in this can't be blamed on savings using poor people and paying them nothing.  The fact is if we raise tariffs or put road blocks up to stop Canadian goods and protect the unions then Canadians will just do the same to stop American goods; the person caught in the middle is the consumer who just has to pay more.  It is like hearing people talk about the way to help is to raise every body's pay to a point they make more money and can spend more-the problem is you do that and things cost more which means you just buy the same and pay more for it-it is called inflation and look back at the late 1970's to see what that causes.  One of the major causes for the depression of the early 1930's becoming the Great Depression for such a long period of time was country after country installing protectionist policies which destroyed the trading system. Are all the trade agreements signed good ones isa negative but they are treaties between countries and once passed by the Congress and signed by the President are international agreements so breaking them will cause a house of cards falling since if we don't keep this one why should some one else keep that one which is exactly what happened to start the Great Depression.  As far as Mexico goes-much of what we import from Mexico are things we need and, honestly the things we don't need are things we want and the American consumer has a very difficult time figuring out the difference between those two things.  We don't need cell phones, Blackberrys, WII's, X-Box, big LCD/Plasma televisions, three televisions in a house, four phones, logo clothing, expensive running shoes and team jackets and the list goes on but many Americans think they deserve it ad will buy it on their credit cards.  You want to help the trade deficient and the credit crunch-"sacrifice" the goodies you charge and live within your means would be a simple, quick and easy way to do it.  Tired of haring everyone else is responsible whether former Presidents, Congress, greedy corporations, unions, instead of who is really responsible and that is the American consumer who spent much more then he could afford to live the good life.|`|8SFoQvVLaa	we import a lot of oil and timber - we are there biggest trading partner

In fact, it is probably not happening.<br>  <br>  1...The nation state was never as independent or powerful as in theory it ought to be. For a long time (to my knowledge at least since ancient Greece and probably for a long time before that) economics (including international trade), migration and demographics have limited rulers' choices. Even powerful empires were subject to these constraints.<br>  <br>  2...What is happening now across large parts of the world is that tiny units have claimed or are claiming independence from larger nations: Scotland, Catalonia, Tibet, Ireland, Georgia.......etc. In other words, nationalism is taking over from great-nation loyalty. If independent, these small units will be subject to the same economic and military imperatives as before (look at Georgia) but will be able to organise their internal life in ways that suit them. <br>  <br>  3...Globalisation is a buzz-word. Certainly, some products and habits (those the mass of the people actually want) are becoming standard across the world. The enterprises which supply the products also inevitably have a global reach, but this does not make them all-powerful, any more than the Athenian potters who supplied most of the Mediterranean were, in that area, omnipotent. Corporations, large and small, are subject to the same sort of constraints as states. Their power is circumscribed by the world they exist in. They frequently collapse, reform, splinter, empire-build, just like nation states. They have always existed (The Honourable East India Company which monopolised the Indian trade and colonised huge parts of India was one mega-corporation of the past: where is it now?) - today's giants will eventually break up or collapse too.<br>  <br>  4...In a word, do not mistake a minor problem of today's world for a permanent world order. All that is new about present "globalisation" is that it is succeeding in providing more goodies for more people than ever before.

I am an insurance agent, so I know what health insurance costs, and I also see many young people deciding not to buy it. They have nice homes, nice cars, all kinds of nice TV's and toys, but cannot pony up the $600 per month for health insurance? Their taxes will increase by much more than that when the government runs it.|`|r3WkhpBpaa	SHOULD NOT. If anyone has seen the military health system then you know why this is a bad idea.

Kind of a god complex really.<br>  <br>  The first amendment protects liberty from that human inclination.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	That is a long and drawn out discussion, but first you should be clear that the 1st amendment is about more than freedom of speech:<br>  <br>  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.<br>  <br>  That is the first amendment in its entirety.

With higher prices for gasoline we will use less gasoline - so there is Obama's contribution to the environment!

It's criteria weren't as strict as later-it was awarded in the same way we might award a Silver Star today-significant heroism.<br>  It was actually WW2 that the Purple Heart was modified to an award for wounds received from the enemy, with the creation of the "Legion of Merit".|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	The Purple Heart as an award was "invented" by George Washington during the Revolutionary War.

ipqxNSvCaa	You'll need to have a recent rabies certificate for the animal.  It will need to have this checked at the point of entry if you're bringing the animal with you.  If you bring it with you on the plane you'll need to have "cat in cabin" reservations (it needs to fit under the seat in its carrier) or put it in the hold (wouldn't recommend this).  In both instances, you need to pay for it as baggage.  Not sure what the procedure is if you have it shipped by itself as cargo.  <br>  <br>  I'd check with U.S. Customs on what the specific rules are (such as how recent the rabies shots have to be), as well as with the airlines.  There are now also special carriers for shipping animals.  I brought two cats back from Turkey without any problems, but the rules may have changed since then.

I never pried into their lives but I do remember that they met in the AF and were both enlisted when they married. I think she got her commission through a commissioning program. <br>  My first Reserve wing had a lot of O and E marriages, but then again they were all Reservists. <br>  I would say you'd have more luck if one of you joined the Guard or Reserve.

If he's Infantry you'd have to be Medical, or a similar split. You wouldn't be allowed to have a personnel job because it might mean you'd show favoritism in his records(Just how the mil thinks).|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  You aren't allowed to date, but you are allowed to be married.  Weird how that works...<br>  <br>  They will even station you two together.  And if you get deployed together, you can stay in "married" rooms...<br>  <br>  They will not allow you be in the same Chain of Command, though.|`|k6N0Fab6aa	Of course you can join and still be married, they will even let you go to the same duty station.You probably couldnt be in the same unit but same station.|`|BImIMnbzaa	I believe this is acceptable, given that it's marriage and not a compromising scenario.

I was in the same situation|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes, you can.  It's a funny rule but you can be married, just not date.  Even with dating, unless you are in the same chain of command, if you are discreet, they usually turn a blind eye.  But you will have no problem.  I know many women officers who are married to enlisted.<br>  <br>  You might have a little difficulty getting joint assignments but the military now works hard to keep you together.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!  And thank you!|`|zSABr7praa	Sure you can!  It's a pre existing relationship, and it won't be a problem at all if you're not in the same chain of command.  <br>  I actually considered doing this as well, however we knew another couple (both 2LT) and in the three years they had been married, they had only spent 4 months together because of training, and deployments.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!!|`|AA10709853	yes you can prove a pre existing relationship so Fraternization does not apply here.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	I think if you were married before hand like you said its ok <br>  not 100% on that|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Yes - he get's to salute you when he comes home every night :)

Shut up retard!|`|5e5c5c1cfde2ffcdb16e4ce17d31b558aa	Like you when I voted it wasn't an issue of race and I voted for McCain because I did not want to live in a socialist country, which we appear to be becoming, I didn't want more social programs being paid for with my tax dollars, which we will soon have, to the tune of close to a trillion dollars, which will be paid for not only by my taxes but those of my children, grandchildren, and most likely my great grandchildren. Although not a wealth man I still feel it's wrong to make the wealthy pay more because they worked hard and earned more.  I don't believe we are a country of many religions.  I think we are a county of Christians with a spattering of other religions that we respect their beliefs.  I don't think the 2nd Amendment is something that's up for interpretation, I think it is a right.  I believe that abortion for the sake of birth control is the killing of another human being.  And unlike you I don't feel that most of the people who voted for Comrade President Obama where informed on many issues at all and were in fact brain washed by the liberal media and did in fact vote for him simply because he was black or were on riding the Obama emotional high of his campaign and I believe that anyone who would say otherwise is being stubborn and has the common liberal attitude of being shocked that no one could possibly disagree with you.|`|BImIMnbzaa	You lost your credibility before you even got started with your silly rant.  You studied the issues?  At What conclusions could you have possibly derived ?  He offered nothing but change, was this the detailed explanation for which you were looking ?<br>  <br>  So far, Obama has done a 180 on every issue he promised, and you're OK with that, what am I missing here ?<br>  <br>  Then, there's the part that you want, want, want, and you did a ton of research about it.  Well, your research doesn't make it so and chances are it will never be so.<br>  <br>  My concern is not so much that Obama was part of the economic failure in the US, but certainly his party was.  My concern is that he's all smoke and mirrors and doesn't , like you, have a clue about what to do next.|`|gGiTQS53aa	Actually he hasn't done anything yet.  It's best not to run your mouth until he actually has done what he proposed to do, right now he has not united the country like he said he would, there is no bipartisanship at all (stimulus bill) and the amount of pork in the bill is well past the usage of the word ridiculous.  <br>  And I'm sure you're one of the well educated men who studyed and studyed (did you happen to come across his birth certificate, I like to piss of libs) but I know I studied my candidate and what we are saying is we are skeptical of his plans to make this a better place.  Not one respected expert in any field has said any plans of his would help America.  Congratulations on trying to screw up our country, looks like we will have to have another republican president in four years to straighten out this mess caused by another liberal know-nothing.|`|WiCjhT95aa	And your backing up who...|`|35ZJauLkaa	You admitting support for Obama.

I'm going to give you my theory of the garbage your reading by conservatives on this site.  The reason why they dominate THIS SECTION of YA is because the internet has become the perfect, anonymous forum for those with unpopular opinions.  Obviously their opinions are unpopular, or McCain would have won, instead of Obama (in a landslide btw).  They basically come here to vent their frustrations about a country and an ideology that has past them by.  You're hearing from the EXPREME right here.  I say this because despite THEIR OPINION, Obama won because even some of the republicans and red states that almost always support the right were intelligent and OBJECTIVE enough to realize that their party has been sinking this country for 8 years, so its time for a change.  I know they like to think that the only reason he won was because of "lazy, stupid, welfare-recieving blacks who only voted for him because he's black so that they can get a handout", but anyone of even average intelligence knows that this isn't true.  Blacks only make up 13% of the population, and we ALEAYS vote democratic anyway.  While I'll admit that their were a lot of black people who've never voted that voted for Obama, its nothing compared to all of the WHITE REPUBLICANS that are fed up with their own party.  If anyone were to spend all day here, instead of in the real world, talking to real people, you would think that everyone is against Obama, and are sorry he's in office, but that's also a falsehood.  His approval rating is still high, and most Americans agree with everythinghe's doing.  The problem with people on the EXTREME side of any party is that they are COMPLETLY consumed with hate, frustration and stubbornest, to the point where its impossible for them to be objective.   They'll even support George Bush and the OBVIOUS, BLATANT f@ck-ups of his administration (some even blame it on Clinton if you can believe that) before they'll give Obama credit, or even TIME for that matter to work on this countries problems.  I coundn't stand George Bush, but I was intelligent enough and objective enough to want to see him succed, for the sake of ALL OF US.  The extreme right want Obama to fail (at our expense) just so they can say "I told you so".<br>  <br>  Remember, this forum isn't NEARLY an accurate portrayl of what MOST Americans think of Obama, just a minority of frustrated people to the extreme right.<br>  <br>  Edit:  See my point...lol.  They're saying those who voted for him were "gullible or got duped", so they're basically calling THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY stupid....lol|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Funny, I saw the same sh*t you did and came to a completely different conclusion.<br>  <br>  I saw a candidate who was a 1st term Senator with very limited political experience, no experience in business or economics, no stated plan for solving anything. All he ever said was "I will have a plan to fix *fill in blank*. I saw a man with very questionable friends and acquaintances. <br>  <br>  I saw a man who worked for an organization that should be investigated by the FBI and probably shut down (ACORN). I saw a man who attended a racist Church for 20 years. <br>  <br>  In short, I saw a man who lacked leadership, judgment and experience to be the President of the United States.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have seen nothing since then that would alter that perception.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	LOL Reps are starting to talk like the Dems did to Bush and now the Dems are mad at it haha.<br>  I'm neither a rep nor a dem, i stay out of roughhousing ;)<br>  <br>  Jesus wasn't a liberal.

I work in an office that is 90% african american women and not 1 of them (that I have spoken to or have heard speaking of Obama) can tell me 1 reason WHY they voted for him other than the color of his skin and the changey hope mantra he so freely spewed during his campaign.<br>  <br>  Here are a few select quotes for the Obama supporters you so ardantly defend<br>  <br>  "it's about time we had a black man in the white house."<br>  <br>  "I can't wait for them to pass dat stimulus so I can get my check."<br>  <br>  "I don't care if he in there another 4 years I'll vote for him to be there another 12 years shoot."<br>  <br>  "He is going to unite us all. he's so anointed, just to hear him speak and see him with his family is like...wow."<br>  <br>  Oh and my personal favorite "they do too much thinking that's what the politicians are for to do all the thinking."<br>  <br>  Really?!  These people did the research on who he was politically?  What his policies and intentions were?  I'd be careful running around claiming that you know that all of the people that voted for him were as diligent as you prior to actually pressing the button or punching their ballot.  You don't know what you're talking about.|`|svzGz9STaa	I'm fine with your ideological decision to vote for BHO. I even voted for him myself in the primary for my state. However, it seems that many of the things he ran on - change you can believe in, the promises of bipartisanship, the audacity of hope - are not being followed in his Presidency. Concerning the state of the economy, he's been anything but hopeful - he's been preaching the politics of fear over and over again by making it appear that things are the worst they've been since we were in the Great Depression, for example, when actually we've had several recessions since the 70's that were, as yet, worse. In times like these, we need a leader who calms us and reassures us, not makes us panic even more. He's been less than comforting and seems only concerned with getting his fake stimulus bill passed.<br>  <br>  In addition, he has shown a remarkable partisanship which also goes against his campaign rhetoric. Having only democrats write the recovery bill, for example, and absolutely shunning Republicans from the process shows a glaring lack of willingness to actually heal the rift between the parties. He certainly has not reached across the aisle. If you recall, Ronald Reagan DID reach across the aisle and worked closely with Tip O'Neal to pass his reforms.<br>  <br>  And then there's the "Change you can believe in" mantra, when so far it appears with many of his appointees that it's politics as usual. If Republicans had been caught not paying their taxes, the media would have been all over it. But when it's a Democrat, well, that seems to be okay. BHO positioned himself to be a different kind of leader who would transcend party politics, but so far, he has been nothing more than a dyed-in-the-wool Chicago Democrat.

While I am not quite ready to accept that this is the path we are heading because I have some faith in those that did NOT vote for Obama value their liberties as I do...I see some of it beginning to happen. Look at the legislation that has been introduced in Illinois. Million dollar insurance policies mandated for gun owners? If that isn't a clear step towards unrest--attempt to disarm your citizens--I don't know what is. Obama hasn't gone at anything "tentatively" in the short time he has been in office. Why the need to RUSH forward legislation and so-called stimulus bills? Because half of us didn't vote for him and can see right through him--that's why. As much as I hope that it doesn't happen...I see a revolution in our near future.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	You are assuming Obama wants to end the economic crash.

If the illustrator was referring to the chimp that was being shot down for mauling the lady in Connecticut, than why bring the president into it and refer the ape to writing the stimulus bill?

Did Obama write the stimulus bill?? no, the monkeys in all of Congress did.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	ill advised and stupid.|`|OKKfyLnlaa	My first reaction when I saw it was that it was ignorant and totally unacceptable.  I can see where people would find it racist, b/c that was my first reaction. The fact of the matter is that black people have been depicted as sub-human ape-like animals since they were brought to the US.  Just look at old slave auction leaflets and cartoons from the 19-20th centuries.  Even in the past ten years I have had racist literature placed under my windshield wiper with this caricature, so that was where my mind first went due to the fact we have a black president and there was mention of the stimulus package.  After looking at the cartoon for a while though, I think it is simply poorly done.  I think it is a not particularly funny, obtuse cartoon that is mixing contexts and trying to draw comparisons that do not make much sense.|`|6Yq8U8IWaa	i like it, b/c i like freedom of speech<br>  <br>  <br>  YES WE CAN<br>  <br>  IMPEACH THE MAN|`|A560oUeyaa	NY Post. Basically it was aimed at congress and did not mention Obama at all. Libs like twisting everything to their benefit.|`|o0JEkGCjaa	Ignorant and totally unacceptable.|`|EAA6GIIWaa	I am going to print it on a transfer and make a t-shirt of it.|`|U9XlITtHaa	I see nothing 'racist' about it.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	funny and only Al Sharpton types would think elsewise as it was aimed at congress|`|Nkwv2hygaa	It was the NY Post and I see nothing wrong. Besides, liberals like Al Sharpton had no problem calling Bush a chimp!|`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	When it was Bush being characterized as a chimp it was okay and funny. But because it is representing Obama, it is wrong.<br>  <br>  I think the cartoon was great... not because I am a racist but I think it is a good representation of the monkey business the congress and white house are conducting. They should have posted it 6 months ago and it might have won an award or something... today there is a double standard and some will find a reason to cause a stink over it...|`|AA11424005	I thought it was funny.  I got the point.  It had nothing to do with Obama or any other black person.  Black racists are always on the lookout for anything to make race an issue.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	My opinion is that they can excuse it all they want, responsible people don't do that and they should know they are wrong.|`|um87XJvmaa	Silly, but not racist.|`|zHQVlXd5aa	Stupid, but not racist|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Neither here nor there.<br>  <br>  You see, I actually read the cartoon and actually know it pokes fun of the people (House Democrats) that wrote the Stimulus Bill.  Not the President.  He did not write it.  Now if the cop in the cartoon said "Now we will have to find someone else to SIGN the next Stimulus Bill, that would have been offensive.<br>  <br>  Funny how the Attorney General calls Americans cowards for not speaking frankly about racial issues while he is being drowned out by Al Sharpton's bull-horn.<br>  <br>  Note to those who believed electing a Black President would usher in the era of post-racism.  Sharpton did not get the memo.<br>  <br>  <br>  *|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Honestly don't care.... A paper should be able to print whatever they wish... if consumers don't like it they will speak with their dollars... I don't see anything wrong with it... but the Post should have known what was going to happen.... I am sure Al Sharpton thought it funny when Fmr. Pres. Bush Jr. was depicted as a Chimp... Just hypocrites with thin skin in my opinion... they will make every critizism of Obama or his administration/congress as an attack towards their race... they really need to grow a pair in my opinion.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	It is not the least but racist...I think the cartoonist meant it to say that the stimulus bill is so stupid that even a chimpanze could have written it!  Plain and simple.  I didn't find it funny just because it didn't fit my sense of humor but I was not offended by it in the least.|`|GgG0inaUaa	Stupid but acceptable. Freedom of speech does not have a clause that says speech must be intelligent. If it did eighty percent of the country would have to be muted, probably including myself.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Speaking as a primate, the cartoon is an insult to my kin.|`|pwFl3C9Taa	Funny, since it was aimed at the Monkeys in Congress who wrote and passed the bulls**t bill.|`|roAahzkIaa	It was the New York Post, and it sucked.
pFlmFv2Waa	TO get into the corps urr bf cannot have any health problems that would enable him to complete Marine recruit training he would have to get at elast a 36 AFQT on the ASVAB also he can;t have any felonies and he must have a highschool diploma not a GED once he has met all of these requirements He will than be shipped to MArine corps Boot camp which from his determination to get in i dont see him having a problem getting through boot camp. THe usuall reqwuriement for enlisting is 4 years active and 4 years inactive unless e has something in Aviation than it would be 5 years active and 3 years inactive. And yes they pay for his place to stay which is not all that but its a place to stay and no they dont pay for a car but if he plans to ship to Japan or something i wouldn;t advise him to even bother with a car. Furthermore he would accumulate 2.5 of days for each month he serves on active duty or 30 days of leave per year how often he would get to come home would depend on where he is stationed if he is stationed overseas maybe twice a year if he is like a state or two away u might see him when ever his chain of command allows him too.<br>  <br>  However if urr thinking of getting married i highly reccomend u do that befroe he enlist so that u too stay together because once the corps has its way i can't guarnatee that u two will be together|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	Look at this website or call a recruiter for the best information.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marines.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.marines.com/</a><br>  <br>  Go to a recruiter then that is how you get in.|`|AHU253b4aa	Depending on the situation the military as a whole can either be a good or a bad decision. That aside, the Marine Corp does have its perks. <br>  <br>  The usual active duty contract for enlisted marines is at least four years of active duty while also serving four years reserve duty after your active duty contract is up. So in total the full contract is eight years of obligated service. These times are some what negotiable with his rececruiter but he has to ask to augment his contract. The eight years is minimum but he can change his contract to five or more years of active duty which would lessen his time in reserve status. <br>  <br>  Also as a note he should look into any bonuses that may be assigned to the particular job or MOS that he will be choosing. Many of them are not openly advertised so he will need to ask. <br>  <br>  As for living expenses and transportation, nearly all of these will be provided for him. Medical, dental, housing and food are retroactivley takenout of his basic pay as compensation. If you look at the rates though they are extremely reasonable. Far less than what is in the civilan world. He will live in barracks depending on his command. Transportation is a privelage and the restrictions on owning a vehicle differ from duty station to duty station. I.E. some commands require that you reach a certain rank before you are allowed to own a vehicle.|`|LwPcGpAOaa	If he has a clean record and is in good health he just needs to sign up with a recruiter.  Once his training is done he will get 30 days of vacation a year and he can call you everyday if he wants.  You could also visit him on base.  I joined the military out of high school and I married my wife shortly after that.  Once married she lived with me unless I was deployed.  10 yrs and two kids later we are still together so good luck.|`|cEFiOrX5aa	I guess he has no mouth since he cannot do his own research, makes you do everything for him. Hey! Better run back to the kitchen, I think I smell his food burning!
yvPA8FSsaa	The American people are slow to anger but once aroused they are a formidable foe.  2010 all Congressmen who voted for the Stimulus Bill without reading if first must be removed from office.  There was nothing more important that should have been occupying their time than this.<br>  <br>  Do you realize how much a trillion dollars is?  For one trillion dollars we could launch the  Space Shuttle over 2,200 times.<br>  <br>  *|`|KaLd1J0Xaa	It's an unwelcome socialist cascade raining down all over and nothing can be done about it short of revolution.

Hopefully we can change this tide in the next general election, because if we don't we may become the next Cuba.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	The only people who believe this is change they can believe in are the people who are still swilling Obama's Kool aid.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Nope, hence the reason I didn't vote for him... The person that yells change the loudest is more apt to be more of the same...|`|ArhIqecxaa	Obamas best moments was just prior to fumbling the oath of the President.<br>  He has bobbled, wobbled and appointed corrupt people, placed responsibility and decision making  with incompetent  Pelosi type people since hour one of his taking office. He is clueless on reality and thankfully the NY Post is allowing his followers to tank the Post and make it evident that if your opposed to Obama your a Racist.<br>  The Obama supporters are the most Racist people in America and hold on, its only going to get worse. The First Lady and her throng of kool aid drinkers are just getting started.|`|A560oUeyaa	I love how the dems blindly voted for a stimulus bill they didn't have time to read.

If he doesn't change we will really be in the worst depression in American history, of course he will blame Bush and so will every other liberal<br>  As for Health care, that's just one big joke right now.

27sSI5wxaa	I agree 100% with you.<br>  <br>  Paulsen asked for $700 billion dollar and told Bush and Congress that he didn't want to have people looking over his shoulders nor did he want to show how the money was being spent.<br>  <br>  Here comes Obama and said that he will have transparency with the remaining TARP money AND he will limit the amount of pay of the CEOs who accept TARP money AND he will insist on those banks who take money to start lending again.<br>  <br>  Yet the Republicans have the audacity to criticize Obama and his stimulus package?<br>  <br>  Americans had better wake up.  We have a President who is trying to do the right thing for the people in this nation.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Because Obama came up with the amount before there was even a draft, so they had to fill it with pork to justify the amount he seemingly pulled out of the air.  Bush`s amount was due to the items that were already in the package, he didnt say uhmm it`s going to be this amount and then have nothing to justify it.  The Senator from Minn. submitted a $1.8 million plan for a polar bear exhibit at his zoo, he said he was asked by the Administration for items that needed to get done.  C`mon another couple million for Field Mice in Cali? How is that a stimulus?  He desparately needed things that would amount to the Stimulus Package.<br>  <br>  Werent the Dem`s the majority also?

Or would you think to yourself, "Gee, I don't want to get punched in the face, so no".|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	You must be referring to TARP.

I'm sure you don't see any logic in questioning that kind of thinking though.|`|8d5879b8993356a74159af131d1c421baa	I'm going to start out by saying I am an Independent before I get bashed for what I'm about to say. No one has any right to complain about it but they do have a right to voice their opinion, which I'm about to do. George W put us where we are in America today and that's not a good place to be. Towards the end of his last term it was apparent that he just threw up his arms and gave up on the American people. I hope and pray that President Obama gets us closer to where we need to be economically. America needs it. So instead of bashing him maybe we should pray that God will guide him in the right direction. <br>  <br>  P.S.

Congress, well they didn't even really exist for 8 years. Bush did it all, good bad or neither Bush was all alone in doing what was done.<br>  <br>  Congress didn't pass any bills.

CBO says it will fail -- not sure about you but when I run the numbers and they come back in the red, I scrap my plans and identify a new approach.<br>  <br>  2.  History is another indicator of failure -- FDR tried deficit-financed spending and he ended up spending 10% of GDP per year chasing down unemployment...which would be like us spending 1.3 Trillion PER YEAR.  Instead we're spending 300 billion w/ a 5 year outlay aimed at a 13 Trillion dollar annual GDP...that's 60 billion per year...not exactly a "stimulus" in comparison.<br>  <br>  3.  The actual bill was only 1/3 stimulus -- the rest of it aimed at expanding government.  <br>  <br>  As for the Bank bailout -- they're still open aren't they?  I mean, people still have their accounts w/ BofA and Citi?  Seems more likely then not when people don't see the consequences of the action, any solution looks like a failure.  I think the bailout kept the banks up and kept the citizens from making runs and/or rioting.<br>  <br>  I didn't agree w/ the bailout, but what can you do when an entity fails and takes down millions of bank accounts/mortgages/investmentportfolios/... etc?<br>  <br>  Ultimately, they're two separate plans with two separate objectives.  Just b/c they call both of them "stimulus" doesn't mean they operate on the same parameters.  <br>  <br>  Obama's aim is to expand government as he's said "only government can solve this problem."  As a Vet, you'd like agree that if our founding fathers were alive today, they'd be loading their muskets and getting ready for another revolution on their home soil.  Big Government and restricted liberty are the very ideals the founding fathers fought against...and here we are -- a people whose collective now embraces those ideals...even though they've failed time and time again.<br>  <br>  We can't ignore all of the red flags while we take this trip to Utopia, as I've heard some people call it.  Those who fail to learn from history are bound to repeat it, and we're awfully close to making that leap right over the cliff (if we haven't already).|`|mZi7R0Enaa	news flash!

Instead of trying to force acculturation of newcomers into an existing mold, as the old "melting-pot" concept did, the "multicultural salad" concept respects people's origins (flavors and textures) and creates the kind of tolerance and mutual appreciation that can really help us all work together as a team to solve our nation's problems.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	It works...until it goes too far|`|TxRRITveaa	no, it highlights our differences and doesn't encourage assimilation.

AA10723498	I'm not a doctor, but the truth is if you pray and ask God to give your mother the wisdom she needs to pass the exam, He will hear you.  "Ask, and you shall receive."  That's a promise from God.  So you can Pray and know through prayer, that your mom will pass, I will also pray for her as well.  It would be terrible not to put her skills to good use.  Tell your mom, she is my prayers and my family will pray as well.  You can't go wrong with prayer.  God bless you and your family.<br>  EDIT Ruth, when any Dr. comes from another country, they have to take the medical boards in this country.  Because not every country practices medicine the way we do and secondly, the board wants to make sure there is no language barrier that would prevent them from understanding the English.  I worked with an RN from Africa,  She had to retake her board exams as well before she could practice in this country,  She had a language barrier and she could not pass the exam,  so she took the LPN exams instead and passed.  They do things differently in Africa but the LPN exam seemed easier for her.  To bad because she was limited and is such a great nurse.  All Dr, no matter where they come from must take the US exams before they can practice.  Some get it the first time around others don't.  I hope that explains it<br>  Ruth makes an excellent point, Never show her any negativity.  Give her support.  Say to her, "Mom, we know you're going to pass this time."  Do you realize how bad she must feel thinking that her family believes she will fail?  Come on. give her something to shoot for.  Have faith in her abilities and have faith in God.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	If she was a certified MD in Egypt, I don't see her problem! Did she go to the AMA and ask what she needed to get her license in this country? There are thousands of doctors already AND practicing in this country, and half of them can't speak English very well!<br>  She should step back a bit, and find out where she is going wrong! Maybe there's a language barrier for her to contend with. YOU and your family must give her ALL your support, and NONE of "She ain't going to pass this test either" attitude! She meeds NO negative feelings surrounding her.  I think what she should do, is to find a doctor who is from the Middle East, just look in the yellow pages and ask him or them, how they managed to pass this test! Did they have a mentor! That always helps.

ipqxNSvCaa	The real question to ask of those wanting more immigration or supporting illegal immigration and amnesty, and accusing anyone opposing them of racism,  is, "what are YOUR racial reasons for wanting this?"  If one's opinion on immigration can only be based in racism, then it works both ways.<br>  <br>  There are actually some people, for example, who believe that "diversity", aided by immigration from Third World countries, will help their racial or ethnic group "get even" with Whites for real or perceived wrongs. (Funny how many of these countries are pretty homogenous themselves and not all that tolerant of "diversity" in tribe, caste, or religion.) Or that it will help them gain political power and "take over" or "re-conquer".|`|JhC6BvPpaa	Point taken.

My mother worked hard picking potatoes off the land. all my four brothers and one sister and myself established a good working life. Should we not have come to England ?? would you want us to go back??<br>  It is not racist or xenophobic to raise the issue of overcrowding and Tax benefits etc to keep those who come to our country and who do not want to work. The "open door policy" applies to every European country. I think it enriches our country to have a variety of nationalities live here.<br>  Of course illegal immigrants should be immediately returned home. <br>  I have mixed with plenty of Muslims and they are exceptionally nice people but I have a problem with the extremists insisting the Islamic way is above our laws, why dont they go back to there own country if they do not like it. But then we have all heard of the proverbial Welsh natives who wont talk to you in Wales unless you learn their language.<br>  It is simple logic to express a point of view, on the basis of overcrowding, if the intake of foreigners boost up the population, it does not make you a racist.

It will be apparent from what you say.<br>  <br>  Also, the real racists are quite pleased to denigrate the term 'racist' as 'just used to silence the opposition' - it means they can shrug off the term when it's used.<br>  <br>  I agree with you - some people are too quick to use the term and do so without really examining what is being said. But that doesn't mean that when some BNP Nazi comes on here spouting hate, the term should be taboo.

However, the president can disapprove legislation and that is called a veto. But that isn't the end. The Congress can overturn anything the president disagrees to by a 2/3 vote in which case the vetoed legislation becomes law.|`|M7oAG5Aiaa	Well you can't look to the republicans for the answer to that question.

The agreement prevented them from disclosing our ideas to others or using them for their own benefit. <br>  <br>  There are a couple of links below to companies that will help you develop your idea, but be cautious and read their agreements before disclosure. Also, I developed a patent myself once before and experience teaches me that ideas sound much better to the originator right after being developed.

While it may be time consuming and troublesome to wait out the procedures, you really have no choice.
