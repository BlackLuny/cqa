Dfr6uA91aa	You have to make sure that the file you just unzipped is in the right place. Sometimes the unzipping program will unzip the files into one of their own folders, instead of where you want it to be.    Since you're asking about a game, the file will most probably be either .8xp, .83p, .8xk, or maybe even .8xg. Look for those files, move them to where you want, then use TI-Connect to make sure you can find them.|`|fC27BshLaa	you should look into the web type games, or look at you manual book.

DyTBoaNjaa	Well to get a good router you need to pay maybe $60-$80 so it can work between rooms. Some good brands are Linksys and Norton. (although my linksys broke down its still an overall good brand) both are sold at stores where you find electronics, ex: Best Buy, Circuit City, and Frys Electronics. (They did not pay me to write this)|`|kSyiUxYSaa	Go to Google and type in...... linksys wireless router. About 50 bucks would get you a decent one.|`|BMConIedaa	The Wii supports Wireless-B networking, but any Wirelesss-G or newer Wireless-N router will work (as long as they're not configured for g- or n-only operation).  Expect to pay between US$30 to $50.  You can find one at nearly any place that sells computer hardware or networking equipment.  Brands to look for are D-Link, Linksys, or Netgear.|`|IuW1t40xaa	you can use any wireless router. have a look on ebay for cheap ones|`|EvMZJ6eyaa	if you find something can you email me because my wifi has not been working!

YK0WMrF2aa	try here|`|OPOBIzqMaa	for xbox live to work you must be connected to the internet. When you attach your xbox to your modem (which is required in order to connect to the internet) it will go through a set up process. Then you can go to "Join Xbox live" by clicking on the X in the middle of your controller. It's going to ask you some questions if xbox live isn't set up on your xbox. From there you need to enter the code (by selecting the enter code option) that is on the back of your xbox live membership card. it will verify it, then ask you to sign in or create a windows live account. After the process is complete, you will be ok to start using xbox live. You can also call 1-800-4my-xbox (1-800-469-9269)
MLSLuRBJaa	The only multi player options are during exhibition games and party games. This can be done before each game starts.  If you are in the challenge mode (where you go around trying to collect all the characters) you can not add more characters.  During this mode it will not allow you yo add a second wii remote.

2yl8omcAaa	The password is the network WAP/WEP key.    If you are trying to connect to your own network then you should check your wifi router settings.    If you are trying to connect to a network (not yours) then has the lock image to it then you will need that password.    You can connect to a network free if there is no lock image next to it.    each network has their own special password. and wifi connection only good to a distance area. for example, you connect to a network using starbucks.. soon you leave starbucks a few distance away, you will no longer able to connect to that network.|`|Ig3arFxraa	As far as i know(this is generally for wifi, not specifically for the itouch, im afraid), wifi capability will allow your device to connect to an existing wifi connection.     This means that the password that it is asking you for is the network key of the network you are attempting to connect to. This network key has been created by the person who owns the wireless router, and unless they give it to you you wont be able to connect.    You can get wifi anywhere, as long as there is a wireless network that you are allowed to connect to. Usually places like Starbucks will have free wireless connections (or for a small fee).     You won't be able to get internet connection in the middle of nowhere!

I haven't tried it yet, but I think I'm going to now.  I have tried the Media Monkey jukebox which has good tag editing capabilities, unless you have a more obscure album which isn't in their database.
3CJAUyqPaa	No. You cannot connect a miniDV tape based camcorder that requires a firewire cable connecting the camcorder's DV port to the COMPUTER's DV port by using an external hard drive that has USB and Firewire ports. The hard drive will be connecting the the USB port on the Mac - Video editors will not recognize the USB port is trying to bring DV into the computer. This would br the same as trying to use any USB-firewire converter/adapter/hub/cable thing - they won't work.    The only thing that might work will be to get a Mac with a firewire port, import the video from the camcorder to it - then move the file to the MacBook.
tWoN22rRaa	Every single SLRs that I know of give you the option of controlling the shutter speed and f-stop value. In fact older models are less likely to possess an "automatic" mode.    --  If you don't mind focusing the lens manually, a FM10 is a nice cheap model. It's even fully mechanical, which means it can optionally operate without a battery (you just lose the electronic light meter).|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Cameras do not have f-stops.     Lenses have f-stops.

Nikon and Canon are both great cameras. I would check Craigslist in your town for one. There is little reason to buy a new one as there are so many high quality used ones available. The reason I suggest Craigslist is that you will wont to see the camera and make sure it works before you buy it. You never know what your going to get on Ebay. See the links below for some examples.    http://boston.craigslist.org/sob/pho/101...    http://boston.craigslist.org/nos/pho/101...    http://chicago.craigslist.org/nch/pho/10...    http://newyork.craigslist.org/jsy/pho/10...|`|0AqkCOWIaa	Short answer: Yes! all SLR's give you both options ( all of them ).     There is no need to elaborate.     You can pick up cheap, used film SLR's on ebay.com, search used film SLR, and you will see lots of them to choose from, at reasonable prices, trust me. Edwin, you don't have to be so literal.

The following should work if Guild Wars works on your computer: Call of duty 1, Splinter Cell, prince of persia sands of time, Full spectrum warrior, area 51, far cry. Starcraft, warcraft.

Most are T or better, though there are some M titles available, but...well, just ignore those.    Otherwise, look into Civilization4, Galactic Civilization 2, and Starcraft.  All are good for strategy.  T-rated shooters are rather hard to come by, as most are going to be M due to the violence.  And I think the last good fighter for the PC was one of the Mortal Kombat ports from a decade ago.  (Seriously, check out Gametap for old arcade fighters.)

QE71sNC3aa	If you want to copy commercial dual-layer DVDs to single-layer DVD-R that hold half the data... Yes, you need both programs.    DVD Decrypter is very old and no longer updated. There are some discs it will not decrypt. I recommend DVDFab HD Decrypter instead...  http://www.dvdfab.com/free.htm  It's freeware.    Rip with DVDFab... Shrink with DVD Shrink... Burn the DVD files to disk with any disc burning software. CDBurnerXP is a good free one...  http://cdburnerxp.se/    It now burns DVDs and works on Vista. Maybe not the best name...    The pay version of DVDFab can rip, shrink and burn all within the one program and make the process a little simpler.
ickyq53aaa	Don't listen to these people saying ds is for kids.  I am 26, I owned both.  I gave away my psp, and bought a ds for my girlfriend.  My ds is great, it plays games with the stylus which gives a whole new feel to gaming.  The graphics are fine.  The older you are, the less you should care about graphics, since the older you are the crappier the graphics were when you started gaming.  I concentrate on playability, which the ds has tons of.  I also have a ds one supercard, so I have a few feature films, tv shows, and a couple hundred mp3's on my ds.  Not to mention my nintendo, super nintendo and genesis emulators on there.  All my favorite classic games, right in my pocket.  Test out some games before you buy, definitely check out Zelda and if you play music, the korg ds-10.  It is AMAZING!  If you want to know how to pimp out your ds, check out some questions I've answered on my profile, or write me an email.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	psp of course.

Well the Nintendo DS is more for younger people that like Mario, Sonic, etc and a touch screen. It has a little more popularity and has a massive variety of games.    With PSP though you can watch and download movies, connect to the internet, better graphics, less variety and more adult games. Does not have Mario, Sonic etc. though.     Its up to you :)  Hope I helped and good luck!
c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	Most companies are touting high mega pixel to sell cameras, but high mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for large pictures or enlarging parts of pictures. Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.   http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j... ...   http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going... ...     Check the Memory Card Storage Table at this link:  http://www.digitalphotographywebsite.com... ...     The memory card I like, bought, and have tested is the Kodak 1GB for $10.88 at Walmart. Had liked SanDisk, but had trouble with two and these were a little more expensive so took them back.  Both seemed about the same speed, but PNY was really slow.  Don't like to put too many pictures on one card because something could go wrong and all pictures would be lost.  Also, different cards could be used for different subject areas.     The number of pictures that memory will hold depends on the mega pixel setting on your camera. My camera will hold about 900 pictures with a 1 GB memory card and a setting of 3 mega pixels. It will take 84 minutes of video at 30 fps.  Could use a 5.2 mega pixel setting, but there would be no improvement in picture quality.     If there are no memory card slots on your computer, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6 each on Tuesday and Wednesday.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select then click Stop and OK.

For example, if a camera takes 500kb Photos, then the memory card will store around 256  1mb photos will equal 128 photos  2mb photos will be 64 photos  Try to figure out the file size of the photos your camera takes.    Some memory cards, all though stated to be 128mb, will actually be less, so that must be taken into the estimate as well

qgE8E70Qaa	Every character has their own special justu that can be activated depending on which controller type you use. However, some characters have alternate special jutsu that can be activated at certain times.    Such as what you stated with Naruto, normally, his special jutsu is Uzumaki Barrage, but when his health is less than 40%, he will use Rasengan, or, you can press the special jutsu button and down on the D-pad and he can become Nine-Tailed Naruto. Other characters, such as Orochimaru have two special jutsu that can be used at any time, he can use Five-pronged Seal by using his regular jutsu, or he can use the sword inside of his mouth to fly across the stage and hurt the opponent using his alternate jutsu. Characters like Sasuke (with Sharingan), Tenten, and Temari can only use their alternate jutsu in the air by jumping. Hope this cleared it up a little bit.|`|NpGSXNqmaa	no it depends on how high your health is.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	The following information describes a better way to move/copy photos to and from a computer and memory card.     Just received some pictures in an e-mail which I moved to the computer.  Then copied these pictures to a memory card and could view them on my camera or show on TV.      If your computer has memory card slots, find the correct slot and copy pictures from the memory card to the computer.     If there are no memory card slots on your computer, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6 each on Tuesday and Wednesday.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.     After you have the memory card plugged in, go to My Computer and open the memory card, select the picture you want to copy, and then copy to the My Pictures folder under My Documents under Documents and Settings.     If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the picture you want to copy and then at top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy Files.  Now select the My Picture folder.  Make and select a sub folder then click Copy.        You can also copy from the computer to a memory card.      Have just been playing with this and found that it works really well, but you should first format the memory card in the camera because it adds files to the card you will need.     Next, take a picture of something with the camera.     Place the memory card in the card reader and go to My Computer.      Open the memory card and you should see a folder on the left (DCIM) that has your picture. Do not open the MISC folder on the right.     Double Click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder e.g.,100HPM417, which includes the name of your camera.  Double Click on that folder and you should see the picture you just took.     When you copy from the computer to a memory card, that is the folder where your pictures must be copied. You may only be able to copy one picture at a time.     One last thing, the file names of your pictures must not have any additional letters or those pictures will not be seen by the camera.  Also, the file name format must match the file name of the picture you took e.g., HPIM1903.  Rename files to the same format as your camera photos.

q0ErVj1Daa	Don't listen to her she's wrong...there is no Split screen co-op on the Wii version of Call of Duty: World at War. However, there is "Squad mate mode" where there's the first player who gets his own person, and the second player gets only a pointer for shooting. It's not fun at all for the second player.|`|26d3xsUNaa	why of course yes|`|XByyskMeaa	No, in coop, the second player is basically attached to you, player 1 moves and shoot, all that player two does is add some extra bullets( all player two is an extra gun.)

xTioPxaVaa	Electrically, something is detecting and amplifying the radio frequency.  It sounds like there is a repeater for a law enforcement division near you.    Guitar amps have a lot of the same components that radio receivers have.  It's just that they're not optimized for radio frequency amplification.  However, if a strong enough signal gets into the amp you will hear it.    Do you have your guitar cable plugged in when you hear this?  If so, then it's acting as an antenna.      Greetings from Austin, TX    Ken|`|qMEqmEpTaa	that's pretty cool but it is common. i never got it before but i know people who have. its just something to brag to your friends about|`|Jn09dNMvaa	some people pick up radio stations, others get what your experiencing. the best solution, is shielding. good cables, and proper shielding of the guitar cavity should help. are you using any effects like a wah, they are more susceptible to that.
qMEqmEpTaa	all recharable batterys die eventually its just a matter of time. they slowly start having less play times and u will find that u have to charge more often to get the battery life you used to get. most rechargable batterys last around 2-4 years depending on how often they are used and charged, etc. i dont think the zune battery can be replaced, you probably have to send in in to microsoft and that usually isn't free.|`|sI6m9uQfaa	Yes it will go bad and No  you can't replace it.  Thats the scam with internal batteries.  Your best bet is to drain the battery and recharge it fully periodically to maintain life span.|`|ca44e4978f073cfbe40e189d1ad4fdacaa	By the time it goes bad you'll probably want to buy another mp3 player anyways.

Send the device back to the manufacturer or take it to a shop to have the software flashed and reloaded  3.  Start at 0000 and keep adding 1 to it (0000; 0001; 0002; etc) until you hit the right number|`|IwaaSQZcaa	try 0000 or 9999. that was mine when it was defaulted. but try popping out the battery, maybe that'll work.|`|E2QIeNewaa	the last 4 digits of your phone number
IXg2gLVUaa	All it takes is having the equipment and the tunes.     People have different ideas of what a dj is.  All school will do will teach you some classes on turntablism and beat matching, which you can learn on your own. Going to school to become a dj is like attending frisby throwing college, it's a waste of time and money. What matters is experience and marketing.    Get with the local dj scene, if there is one, and try to mix with the local dj's at record stores, clubs, shows, etc. Most are really friendly and love to show you what they use and how they got the gig.|`|sXUGgcTeaa	No you just need time patience equipment and the love for music

sUSfQ9AZaa	I bought a Blu-Ray player for my new LCD TV. It upconverts DVD's to near 1080 quality. I have over 200 DVD's in my collection. I have rented a couple of Blu-Ray movies to test the waters.    I noticed VERY little difference. My player did such a good job of upconverting the video, that I find it a waste of money to spend $20 or more for blu-ray movies.    I will keep buying cheap DVD's until the price of Blu-Ray movies comes WAY down, I mean to under $10. Save yourself money and just buy a good upconverting DVD player for now, and hold on to your DVD collection. It is NOT an amazing difference in picture quality to justify the cost of Blu-Ray|`|UWJinEbIaa	Can you notice the difference between "regular tv" that is 4:3 ratio and "high def tv" that is 16:9?  If you can then you might as well spend the $500 for a Blu Ray player.  I think the whole internet connectivity deal is overrated and is just a way for the studios to get more money out of the consumers....I guessed they didn't learn their lesson from Divx.|`|trld04B0aa	I'm not gonna lie, I love blue-ray. I won't buy a blue-ray player, and I don't own any blue-ray discs, but I love watching movies on blue-ray. The picture is amazing. I wouldn't say more life-like, per say, but more detailed.    That's my opinion, anyway.

Has to where they are the most common is in your home, of course that is if you have a wifi router connected to your internet modem. Other then that the most commercial locations are fast food places, hotels, motels, Possible schools, malls. Most businesses have wifi in the building but it is secure and you'll need the WEP key to access. Your home Wifi may also have or need a WEP key to access it. If it does you 'll need to locate it.|`|lGvbEmAXaa	go to settings.  then wifi.  then turn on wifi.  then connect to router.

xQjToANXaa	To be honest personally I woul;d like share my experience about wii. Nintendo wii console is a latest innovation in the field of games. This is the funniest game for kids and comes with all power packed games.  Without wasting your time you should visit atleast once http://www.blueunplugged.com/p.aspx?p=12...  If you buy wii fit along with wii console that will be great. On wii fit kids can do fun and young and old age can work out.No need to go in gym.  Except these more others games are FIFA-09, guitar hero world tour, animal crossing, carniavl fun fair etc.  http://www.blueunplugged.com/c.aspx?c=53...|`|0JV3tQm8aa	Wii is great    Game:    Super Smash Brothers Brawl  Wii Fit  Super Mario Galaxy  Animal Crossing City Folks|`|hl6ReF3zaa	only a couple of wii games are fun but the 360(Halo 3) and PS3(Resistance 2) have better shooters and RPG than the Wii.|`|BjDBXyROaa	it's worth it, like any other system.    it just depends on the games you buy can be a cause of getting bored. even if a game is really good you'd still get bored on the wii and other systems because you probably play it to much. that's just how games are  but all n all it's worth it.|`|qrB0QxN8aa	Wii games are fun for all ages.  Games like Galaxy may look kiddy but their gameplay can be addicting.  The games that are good are good.  My 360 fanboy friends even admit the Mario Kart, Twilight Princess, Brawl, and many other are amazing.  I would recomend Resident Evil 4.  It took a couple of playthroughs to get me bored and I still play it.  Games are coming out that look amazing and there are games for everyone even now.|`|CckCvJpyaa	Don't hesitate get the wii, it is the best console ever created, it is great fun and LOADS of great games not just kid games.|`|5Z4yxxXQaa	Its worth buying, wii sports itself is a fun game, those games that look like kid games are actually quite fun lol.|`|N2FBBCAGaa	IT IS WORTH IT!   Wario SHAKE IT  ZELDA  SMASH BROS.|`|q6uyloYdaa	It can be worth it. I personally don't think it is. Most people get Wiis and play Mario games and Wii sports and simply get bored with it. There are some good games for it, but 99% of the stuff that comes out for the Wii is crap marketed towards people who will buy whatever and don't know any better.|`|1NPVVxW0aa	Wii is more fun if you have someone to play it with - I've seen the hardest PS3 and Xbox anti-Wii people become converts playing against their friends.    It's also much more accessible for families from young children to elderly parents/grandparents.    Lastly, Wii's are still extremely popular and in short supply so even if you don't like it you'll probably not lose much more than the price of a game if you buy one!|`|xZA35cqraa	they r sooooo much fun!      http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|mcvPwigpaa	I've got bored of it and am selling mine for another console because I never play on it anymore.|`|2yUQiKlvaa	yeah it is worth it. there are many great games which are a lot of fun, people say that the wii is mainly for family games, which to be fair it is the best console for family games but it is also good for many other games. for example resident evil 4 is a really good shooting game and has a brilliant story line and it isnt a family game, spiderman web of shadows is also another brilliant game and so is zelda the twilight princess. some of the best games that are good for a family are supermario party and wii play.     the speed of it is really good and when playing shooting games it feels like you are really there as you actually get to aim at the screen, it makes games feel so more realistic. its great!!!|`|fOsqH1uIaa	ITS SO FUN!! I think game from the wii is to get the family together.|`|e8f092bbd197b0b3bdad36d4e1287a01aa	dont bother, there sooo booring|`|zI323mBHaa	Trust me its fun the first 2 days after you will want to throw it in the garbage and i heard a new WII coming its visual or something i dont know what its about but don't stay on pc wait for other consoles to come and buy them AND YES IT IS KIDISH FOR 10 Yrs old dont want to get fat thank you|`|BX8rrBajaa	Honestly, I could have cared less about getting a Wii.  But, my parents bought us one for Christmas, and I fell in love with it!  And I never play video games!  My whole family was shocked.  Yes, you should definetely buy a Wii.|`|UiuTVPDTaa	There are many games available in a shooter setting, if your used to a XBox or Playstation then they are very different. Overall quality is not as great as other systems, but use-ability is excellent allowing you to get into the game. Games like Far Cry, the Resident Evil games, and the world war 2 type games are great. The problem is, that for as many great games available for this system, there are hundreds of junk games out there too.|`|ByR8wgFaaa	yes buy 1 there awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!my fam got 1 for christmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!mario kart is really fun and wii fit is amazing!!! wii sports is fun and wii music and bogie is fun and other stuff like that!!!!!!!!!! hope it helps btw u deffinately wont get bored!!!!|`|MP7KFFTmaa	a wii is very fun. there are so many games you're sure to find a lot that you enjoy.

9sRUf4zEaa	In terms of the wifi, I found placing the ps3 closer to the router or directly plugging the ps3 directly to it though a CAT-5 cable will allow the signal to be better. Also, it's better to stand the ps3 vertically since it will allow better circulation for the vents and it will prevent dust from entering the ps3.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	Since the PS3 has integrated Wi Fi it doesn't matter on the orientation. If you are going to stand it up vertically, then make sure it isn't on a carpet and make SURE it has at least 5 inches of room for the fans to properly circulate air.

LywfC5y6aa	the lowest would now be $400 new.  so check to see how many gb it is?  then if it's a 80gb it's worth $250-$300 or if it's the 160gb it's worth $350.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	20GB-$350  60GB-$500  Old 80GB $450--80% of PS2 games  ----these have 4 USB ports and play PS2 games----    new 80GB-$300  40GB-$270  160GB-$430  -----these have 2 USB ports and don't play PS2 games------|`|URpSHVF9aa	If it is the 60gb ps3 then sell it to them in $450  It seems like a higher price then the new ones in store but it is worth it.    they will be able to play ever ps1,2,3 games ever made    the 60gb ps3 has flash card readers which new ps3's don't    if they don want it at that price then try to ask them how much money they are willing to pay and add $50 to it|`|5Bbp8Z1xaa	Sorry for the long answer but its worth it. It depends how many games u have for it and how many controllers, so say u have 1 to 10 games and 1 controller sell it for 325 or 350. and say u have 10 to 20 games and 2 controllers 400 bucks say u have 1 to 10 games and 2 to 4 controllers 300 dollars to 325. and say u have 10 to 20 games and 2 to 4 controllers, sell it for 400 to 450. but if u are a generous guy or girl u can bring down the price to like 275 or something bring down the prices of like 50 bucks or something like that. If every one wants to buy it then do an auction to the person who would pay the most and if u dont like auctions then do like pick the straws or something like that. or ask the person who would give u smething els with the money for it.|`|A2BCezFVaa	those prices are right. but the newer 80 version isnt as good as earlier versions (the 60 was the best).  theyve stopped production on all models but the 160, and theyve announced there's gonna be a new price and/or price drop in a couple months. i think theyre gonna bring out a new model, maybe a usa version of the 40. wait and see is my advice.
0AUTZt5Aaa	Yes. The easiest way is to hold down the power button until you hear a bunch of beeps (around 5-10 secs). Once you hear the beeps, you know it has reset itself. Now restart the PS3 you can view the PS3 through the component (yellow, white and red) cables.

If you record HD programming though, the Tivo will only record it as SD and not HD as the S1 and S2 are not capable of recording in HD.    If you have a series 3 or TivoHD with cable cards, you will be able to record and watch SD and HD programming as these receivers can output HD.|`|UyfTZYATaa	Yes it will work we  have a hdtv and it works really well, we use it as a converter thing like a set top box.  I love tivo's!!!
ivsKcwwvaa	No. If you extend it, the majority of those lagging behind still won't be prepared, and want another extension. On the other hand, if they wake up one morning and have no reception, they will get on the ball and take care of business in a day or two. Of coarse they will complain for two weeks, but at least we will have all moved on.|`|twPZBsH2aa	No, it's been known for years. People that are not ready for DTV are not ready based on their own ignorance or laziness.    It's time for poeple to take responsibility for their own decisions, like the decision to ignore the numerous notices about the DTV deadline.

02lcuxyzaa	They have two  plans one is unlimited internet on the phone only .The other one is for using the phone as a modem (tethered) with a 5gb per month maximum download.It costs twice what the standard unlimited internet plan is.I have the tilt also and i use it that way occasionally maybe once every other month and don't get charged for it.But if i used it all the time where the data transfer rates were high they would probably look at it.
76mQry8baa	Good Question.  Considering how game developers and microsoft absolutely abandoned the first one, it could be too late.  It is getting a bit late in the life cycle of the 360 but I'm guessing it will be going strong for at least a couple more years.  They've got a lot of strong titles lined up, they just hooked up with netflix to stream movies and there is alot downloadable content these days.  By the way, they didn't totally abandon the first xbox, you can still play online with it and there are still Halo2 junkies on there.  So even when the next gen comes out people will still playing the 360 online.|`|B2Itq6Fcaa	no, but a ps3 will be a better invesment all around|`|DHYOOo0faa	no

There are a very, very few Blu-ray players that do not support standard definition DVD playback.  Chances are good that you don't have one of these.  If your player doesn't support DVD playback, nothing will happen to your system.  All that will happen is that your player will tell you that it can't read the media you inserted and ask you to eject it or it will eject it automatically.    One benefit of the Blu-ray player is that almost all of them function as an upscaling DVD player (i.e. it will 'upscale' any standard definition signal to either 720p, 1080i or 1080p depending on what your HDTV is capable of supporting).    Good luck!
nA8l89GXaa	Try to do a hard reset. Hold the Home button and Power button til the apple icon shows then release.. Should work fine then.|`|rrJoXDKUaa	You had to many apps running because mine did that just take the sim out turn it on then off and put it back in and it should turn on the end the apps if not then i hope you find it
qWicVoU9aa	There are 2 different resets for that device.  The first one just resets everything to factory defaults.  Everything will still be on the device but anything you had personalized will have to be redone (I would suggest saving your contacts to the SIM card jsut to be on the safe side).  The second one does just what its name implies.  It clears everything and it will all be lost.  I do not usually recommend the 2nd one unless someone is getting rid of the device and wants all of their info to be erased from it.:     Reset Default   From the standby screen, press Menu.  Scroll to and select Settings.  Scroll to and select Reset Settings.  Scroll to and select Master Reset.  A confirmation screen will appear, select Yes.  Enter Security code, press OK.  NOTE: The default security code is 0000.    Clear memory    From the standby screen, press Menu.  Scroll to and select Settings.  Scroll to and select Reset Settings.  Scroll to and select Master Clear.  Scroll to and select desired option:  Handset   Memory Card  A confirmation screen appears, select Yes.  Enter security code, then press OK.  NOTE: By default the security code is 0000.|`|rrJoXDKUaa	Every thing exept what it came with and whats on your sim|`|5a3f1f4842aa890851311a50eceaf47baa	I've heard that it will only get to the factory defaults. So it will delete your contacts from the phone but from the SIM . Also if you get it form a carrier for example AT&T it will only get to the factory defaults that means how it was configure for the carrier    Note: Master Reset  Dial the following 2945 * 6 or 2945 *45 
557c65c1d2224dfe3c2fe5c6f798e6e5aa	I am assuming you mean you don't want to convert the video into another format but just want to download it and then burn it onto a disk and have it playable on your DVD player?  If so, make sure that the movies you download are in ISO format.  ISO is an image file and all you need to do after downloading it is to burn the image onto a DVD using a DVD burning program like NERO.

Look around ebay, you'll be able to find another one that you want from a experienced and trusted seller.|`|sPNTq4WKaa	I wouldn't do it, where is he located is a good question, do they want you to mail cash or are they using paypal. I wouldn't do a transaction over ebay without payal, and ask to see more pictures of the Pda. People who steal pictures don't normally have more. Also sometimes they might have a buysafe thing at the bottom of the page. Idk that much about that though. So just be observant and if you feel it is a scam it probably is. Sometimes it is just best to buy it at the store, even though you want a good deal it may not be the best choice.
QekY4ycuaa	I depends on the blu-ray manufacturer. Try going to their website and look up the player in the help section (the instruction manual might have the info on how to do it). There will usually be a section addressing updates. Also, if your blu-ray player has an ethernet port on the back, hook it up to the internet and check the menu for an update icon.|`|3mIMWRKGaa	yes memorex is a cheap name brand...yur blu ray player is probably an older profile...prolly profile 1.0...check to see if u have an ethernet port on the back...the newer profile 2.0 blu ray players must have at least 1Gb of internal memory and an ethernet port for firmware upgrades...i would take it back...save a lil more and buy a newer profile blu ray player...the ps3 would also be a good joice as it has tuns of memorey and of course can access the intrnet for firmware updates|`|3RCdVPsAaa	Yes, it sounds like you do need a firmware!

557c65c1d2224dfe3c2fe5c6f798e6e5aa	Are these commercial VHS movies?  If so, they are most likely copy guarded so it isn't as easy as hooking up a VCR to a DVD recorder.     http://www.bestbuy.com/olspage.jsp?id=pc...    Can I copy movies from commercial VHS tapes or DVDs?    Well, yes and no. As you may know, in order to protect copyrighted material, commercial DVD and VHS tape manufacturers have developed copyguards (special coding) built into the discs and tapes to prevent illegal duplication. So, when you try to duplicate these sources using a DVD recorder, you'll get either an error message not allowing you to copy them, or if you are able to make copies they will be scrambled, rendering them unviewable. That said, certain electronic devices and software programs that override copyguard encoding do exist.        You will need a copy stabilizer.    http://www.world-import.com/dp-5000_copy...|`|658c97c2e40e2eb3b804b250ef53cb21aa	Yes.    You would need VCR & DVD recorder to do the job.    But you are not going to get VCR, you may get some record companies to do for you.    The easier is to dump the videos, rent the DVD you want to watch.    No point buying them, who knows DVD would be phased out and blue-rays become dominant?|`|AA11488973	sometimes you can. I bought a dvd recorder/vcr combo.  It recorded my home videos onto dvd just fine but when I put in a tape that i dubbed from a dvd years ago it would not let me. it said it was copy written and unauthorized. The unit i had was a magnovox, so i can only speak for the brand i used.  And no worries I still have about 200 vhs movies...hard to let them go.

cNwOuLuGaa	unfortunately most songs you purchase from iTunes have a lock on them.  If you can see the songs you want as a file you might be able to convert their format.  I'm guessing Windows Movie Maker wants the songs to be in a .wav file or something similar.  The easiest way I can think about doing this is opening iTunes and right clicking a song.  Copy and paste the song into a created folder or the desktop...somewhere you will know where to find it.  If you can right click and "Open With..." Movie Maker, than see if that works (probably not, but worth a shot).  Also, see if you can change the format.  If the song(s) are locked, burn a mixed CD of the songs you want and re-upload/rip the CD you just made back onto the computer because it will most likely put them into a format you can use--you just have to remember where to find those files.  I hope this helps...I've had trouble like this before and if you mess around long enough something will work.|`|uky2nsh8aa	just google and converter. ^_^|`|AF7c7gjbaa	Here is a step by step guide to rip DVD and convert any videos to other video formats and audio formats for iPod touch/classic/video/nano, iPhone, Zune, PSP, video capable MP3 players, YouTube, Myspace, etc. Meanwhile, it can also support output almost any audio/video format including Video format (H264, MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, RM, 3GP, flv, SWF, mpeg-1, mpeg-2, VCD, SVCD, DVD, etc.) and Audio format (AC3, AAC, MP2, MP3, MP4, RA, WMA, etc.).

Vista-Publish/  XP-Finish movie (w/ rendering) - save file for sharing (youTube, etc.) or burn to disc         It is next to impossible to finish movie editing in just one sitting, so that an edit history to return to will come in handy. Save Project is a process w/c is true for most if not all video editing app w/c is done at any point during the activity.            *.mswmm  is a file extension (NOT a video format) of saved WinMovieMaker PROJECT (wmmp), a 'work-in-progress' w/c archives links to various video/ pic/ music/etc. files digitally collected, plus the edit history at the time of save project. If the editing process cannot be finished in one session, the process can continue later starting with this *.mswmm  (wmmp)  file. Also, this allows for multiple re-edits until satisfied.        If there is no .avi or .wmv file, it would mean that Step 3- Publish/Finish Movie- save to computer was not done... meaning, no movie was created OR the editing process could have been finished, but the valid .avi or .wmv file could not be located. In Step 3, WMM allows the editor to type name of movie, destination folder & to choose the format & resolution of final muvee.        Hope you have not deleted or moved the files used in editing, just open the *.mswmm  (wmmp) file and the finished or unfinished project will re-appear for re-edit.

TbTO5SXlaa	Deciding on what film to buy is usually determined by what you plan on photographing and the conditions you expect to encounter. Film choice is also dependent on whether you have access to a darkroom for black & white processing. It also depends on whether you want color prints or slides.    Since I only shoot print film, here is what I use.    For landscapes or macro photography on a sunny day I use Fujicolor Superia Reala, ISO 100. When Spring arrives I'll probably switch to the new Kodak Ektar, ISO 100.     If I know its going to be a windy or slightly over cast day I use either Fujicolor PRO400H, ISO 400, or Kodak Portra 400VC, ISO 400, Vivid Color.     If I'm going to be photographing people I use Kodak Portra 160NC, ISO 160, Natural Color.    Since I don't presently have a darkroom, for black & white I use either Ilford XP2 Super, ISO 400 or Kodak BW400CN, ISO 400. Both of these films are C-41 compatible which means any 1 Hour Lab can process and print them. You just have to stress that the prints are SUPPOSED to be black & white.     I buy my film from one of these sources:    http://www.bhphotovideo.com  http://www.uniquephoto.com  http://www.adorama.com    I suggest buying your first roll of any of the films I mentioned at your local camera store. That way you can decide for yourself which one best suits you before buying in 10 roll lots from one of the on line stores. I've found that buying on line saves me 50% to 60% when you deduct the local sales tax and after paying for shipping. I occasionally buy film on eBay but only if the seller lists the Expiration Date. If I have to ask then I buy elsewhere. I have a couple of air-tight containers and store my film in the refrigerator.     When shooting landscapes, my camera is always on a tripod. My lens of choice is a 21mm at f16 and focused to 6 feet. That gives me a depth of field from 2' 2" to infinity. This allows me to include closer objects to increase the feeling of depth. I shoot in Aperture Priority and use a cable release or the camera's self-timer to release the shutter.    For macro photography I use a 100mm macro lens. Years ago I tried a 50mm macro but sold it to buy the 100mm. I like the longer working distance of the 100mm for bees plus it interferes less with the lighting.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	DUHHH 35mm|`|iu0nUntNaa	35 mm film.

Some old films (cartridges) might fool the ISO setting on your camera, but with the present films (made in last 10 years or so) any 35mm film will do.    Don't buy any large film stock (big roll) to cut and use in a different cartridge. Stick to the ones that are marketed for ready to use (common 35mm films)    I prefer Fuji Velvia for landscapes  Tri-X for Black & White
6rxhges4aa	if it is only three weeks old you are entitled to a replacement set-don't let them fob you off-that's the law.    if all the connections are correctly inserted and working and it does turn out to be a faulty set refuse a repair and demand a replacement set-you are entitled to do this because as you have had the set for less than 6 months it is up to the supplier to prove the set did not have a generic fault when it was sold to you.    if they don't play ball tell them you demand a refund or the matter will be reported to trading both standards and comet's highest authority (don't forget to ask for the branch manager's name)-you will be surprised how compliant people become when it gets personal.    apart from which-would you pay good money for a television that's just been repaired?-accept a repair and that is exactly what you will have done.    think about it...|`|qw1ImStvaa	Well, wait and if no one comes and fixes it, then take it back.

Never pay for extended warranties because the statute of limitations for returning an item to have fixed 'free' of charge is 6ys, depending on the price paid, under The Sale And Supply of Goods Act 1994. So if you bought a 1000 tv and it went bust in say 3  yrs then that would come under the act.....quote...'Should do the job it was purchased for and last a reasonable amount of time' unquote.

ilScrvPEaa	If you followed all instructions (like this one http://ru.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKFnuCfTPZ... ) and you've got a memory stick with a proper software - you can install CFW. There is one problem, though. You can do it only with PSP-1000 and PSP-2000. PSP-3000 wasn't hacked (technically, hackers had found one exploit for that, but they're waiting for Sony's next move, so hack for 3000 isn't out yet).
TbTO5SXlaa	A true macro lens is considered a "prime lens" - a fixed focal length such as 50mm, 60mm, 90mm, 100mm. In my opinion, zoom lenses that use "macro" in their description are misleading and should be called "close focusing".    A true macro lens is designed to perform at very close distances. It has minimal light fall-off from center to edge and maximum sharpness from center to edge. It has a flat field of focus which is needed for photographing stamps or paintings or any flat surface subject. With a true macro lens you get a 1:1 (life-size) image of your subject. A 10mm long insect will be 10mm long on your sensor. A "macro zoom" will seldom give you more than a 1:4 (1/4 life-size) image so your 10mm insect will be 2.5mm on your sensor.    I have used a 100mm macro for years and prefer its longer working distance when bees are my subject. There is also less chance of interfering with the light with a longer working distance.    The Tamron 90mm macro has gotten good reviews. Of course the Canon 100mm would be your first choice if money isn't an issue.    I found both lenses at B&H ( http://www.bhphotovideo.com ):    Canon 100mm macro @ $490.00    Tamron 90mm macro @ $359.00 after a $60.00 mail-in rebate.    You can also check prices from these stores:    http://www.keh.com  http://www.adorama.com  http://www.beachcamera.com  http://www.cametacamera.com  http://www.uniquephoto.com    If you find a deal that seems too good to be true, check the seller at http://www.resellerratings.com|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	the Sigma aftermarket brand is cheaper and still great quality  http://www.nextag.com/canon-macro-sigma-...    I LIKE THIS, YOU'D NEED A TRIPOD ON ITS LONGEST ENDhttp://www.dslrcamera.com/7-499248-B0016...|`|pZGLhV2Waa	For true macro you need a prime macro lens that will give you 1:1 image ratio. Meaning that you could focus in on a penny for instance and it would fill the frame. Your best bet would be the Canon EF 100mm F2.8 macro. There are a couple of other smaller Canon macros as well but I feel the extra working distance of the 100mm is worth it. It is also a very sharp lens to use for photographing anything else and will about double the focal length of your current lens.    There are some third party lens makers like Sigma, Tamron, and Tokina that will offer prime macros as well as telephoto zooms with a macro feature. The tele macros will allow you to focus very closely though not as close as a true macro. The advantage is that they are also telephoto zoom with focal lengths typically in the 70-300mm range. The downsides are that they wont focus as close in macro mode and the image quality is not nearly as good as a true prime macro.

fwnqB0dTaa	No, as their number has been hidden at source.    This may be from the phone being used, or because it is going through a switchboard that anonymises the number, if my work phone me the number comes up as unknown.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	no, you won't. if something says private, you can't call them back because obviously, you don't know the number. maybe someone just called you by mistake. don't worry|`|5zoKN6nWaa	Uh yea.Hit *67 and call them back.Thats how I do mines

On balance you start out with soccer heading, ski slalom, ski jump, and table tilt.  aerobic- hula hoop, basic step, basic run, 2 people run,  strength- single leg extension, torso twist, push up and side plank, jack knife, lunge  yoga-tree pose, warrior, half moon, deep breathing    then there are several to unlock,    when you get on each time you do a body test that weighs you and test your center of balance, stability etc... you have to type in how tall you are and your birthday and how much your clothes weigh it gives you a wii fit age based on these results and then you do your training (the games and exercises) it charts your weight, bmi, and time logged in exercising on graphs.    my favorite games are aerobic--rhythm boxing, hula hoop, super hula hoop  balance games--snowboarding, and ski slalom  strength--the challenges jack knife, push up and plank these are the last to unlock on strength(you test how many you can do against the trainer,each time you do it your trainer gets better and can do more but it starts off easy)  yoga-shoulder stand is very relaxing and so are some of the other poses, I hate the one foot poses since I cannot balance well on one foot especially on the board.  found it all of the games        * Yoga - Work on your balance and flexibility with Yoga poses and activities            o Deep Breathing            o Half-Moon            o Dance            o Cobra            o Bridge            o Spinal Twist            o Shoulder Stand            o Warrior            o Sun Salutation            o Tree            o Downward Facing Dog            o Standing Knee            o Palm Tree            o Chair            o Triangle        * Strength Training - Put your strength to the test with muscle-toning exercises            o Single Leg Extension            o Sideways Leg Lift            o Arm and Leg Lift            o Single-Arm Stand            o Torso Twists            o Rowing Squat            o Single Leg Twist            o Lunge            o Push-Up and Side Plank            o Jackknife            o Plank and Tricep Extension            o Push-Up Challenge            o Plank Challenge            o Jackknife Challenge        * Aerobics - Get your heart pumping with fun, interactive Aerobic exercises            o Hula Hoop            o Super Hula Hoop            o Rhythm boxing - similar to step aerobics but including the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to throw punches.            o Basic Step            o Advanced Step            o Free Step            o Basic Run            o 2-P Run            o Free Run        * Balance Games - Get into the action with fun, balanced-based games            o Football Heading (also known as "Soccer Heading")            o Ski Jumping            o Ski Slalom            o Snowboard Slalom            o Table Tilt - The player must shift their balance to get balls into holes.            o Tightrope Walk - The player must cross a tightrope avoiding the bear traps.            o Balance Bubble - The player attempts to navigate down a river in a bubble without bursting it on the sides.            o Penguin Slide - The player has to catch fish while balanced on a piece of ice.            o Lotus Focus - The player must remain motionless while looking at a flame.|`|3Zeg6dcQaa	the wii  a wii Sensor a wii mote and nun chuck wii sports and insurktion

uky2nsh8aa	You need iTunes to use an iPod.  go to the apple site and download it, then move all ur music to it, u don't need to buy anything.   from there, plug ur iPod in and it'll show up on iTunes and guide you through what to do.|`|n3gT0KRiaa	Firstly with any ipod you have to register with itunes regardless of whether or not you buy music.  To do this connect your ipod to a usb  port on your computer and make sure you're connected to the internet.  Your ipod will be recognised and will take you straight to itunes, you  will also need a credit card to register.  I know it sounds strange but  that's the way Apple work, once you have registered do an update of the latest software for your nano. The software will load onto your PC open itunes software. Now you can either put your own music on your ipod via your dvd-cd drive on your computer, When you have chosen the music just tick the tracks you want on your ipod go to the top left had corner to my library which is a drop down and go to sync to ipod.  Job done! If in future you want to change your music or add to your library just un-tick or tick the tracks you want.  As for limewire I guess you know that it is renound for sending viruses  through with what ever you download right!  Itunes is certainly the best for buying your music.  If you live in Australia you can buy Itune vouchers from many outlets such as Coles, Officeworks and any Post Office.  I buy $50 at a time and the voucher lasts for 2 years, if your not in a hurry to spend it. Or it just deducts the amount off as you use it and shows your balance at all times.  Bit long winded but hope this helps!|`|d1353183769e541a7ddad3ab518bcc6baa	Download iTunes from apple.com and then go to Limewire and highlight the music you want and click it and drag it onto an iTunes playlist. Then plug in your iPod and it should load.|`|x1yyigwxaa	well first you need the software iTunes to connect your music to your ipod. Then when you plug in your ipod the window for itunes will open and a little symbol of you ipod will show.   Go to it and go to manage settings/songs  and click the box that says manage songs manually.    as for Limewire  you have to save all the music files onto your computer then import them in iTunes.
VOSyb1fcaa	Unfortunately, Nintendo doesn't sell their wired sensor bars anymore. But, you can buy it from their online store for pretty cheap ($7.50) :    http://store.nintendo.com/webapp/wcs/sto...    You can definitely get a wireless sensor bar in those two stores. The Nyko sensor bar is the best, and that's probably the one they have anyways.    The sensor bar costs about $20, and can be found in both stores (it's packaged in a plastic tube, it may be hard to find). Here's the link to both sites, to show they're in stock:    http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductD...    http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...    I don't trust the wireless ones either, having to get up and turn it off and on is really annoying. But unless you're sure your dog wont chew it up again (or your mom won't run it over with a vacuum, for that matter) then get a wireless.    Good luck!|`|DkSv6OZzaa	lmao!!! wow, my black lab did the same thing to mine!!! hahaha, yeah, you can get the wireless sensor bars at wal mart, and you should be able to get both wireless and wired sensor bars at gamestop depending on what they have in stock at your areas store, but walmart for sure should have them, thats where I got mine...it was only $20|`|NpGSXNqmaa	yes you can get one there and its like 15 dollars i think. you can use candels as a wii sensor bar. The sensor is the wii-mote itself   http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=_1vQFchFr_... heres a link. Hope i helped ;)|`|5Bbp8Z1xaa	U should really get the wireless so the dog cant get the wire and to get one go to wal-mart or something like that and ask if they have a carrying case for ur wii with a wireless sensor bar in it. If not call the Nintendo factory and ask them to get u a new one because ur dog ate it. they will send u one for free or for like 10 bucks or 5 bucks. it should show the phone number on the box. hope this helps.

IwaaSQZcaa	Synchronizing is when all the stuff on the ipod is deleted and made into the information on THAT computer. So if you synched the ipod to your computer, you'd have only one song. That's why I don't sync, instead, I 'manually manage' it. So when I connect it to a different computer it doesn't delete my songs/pics/vids. I can just drag songs from THEIR itunes onto my ipod. Simple :)|`|0BkVs1X1aa	do not sync your ipod into his playlist... i did that same thing but thank gawd it was only 10 songs... DO NOT ADD THAT SONG!!!|`|rSecaZGcaa	If its on the same itunes on the same computer then it wont delete :D  Simple enough? ;P
ZBIWfaK1aa	I have the LG Dare, and I absolutely love it!  Personally, I think it rivals the iPhone, and is much less expensive.  Here are some pros and cons that I have experienced:    Pros:  Considering all it's features, i think it is incredibly well-priced.  I got mine on sale for 130 dollars, and I think there still might be a sale going on...  It's touch screen is also amazing, and has interactive "buzzes" whenever you touch something, which makes it a lot easier to tell what you're pressing.    It's VCast music is awesome, and a great, cheap way to get music onto the phone is by burning a CD of your favorite songs from iTunes and then syncing the CD songs into Vcast Rhapsody.  You can then download it for free onto your phone.  I'm not sure what your budget is, but I got Vcast navigation and web browser email free for a month, but it's 80 dollars after that (which also includes other features like Vcast videos and stuff)  It also has an amazing camera, and takes exceptional videos, for a camera-phone.  It also has removable memory, so when your phone memory is full, you can just put in another SD card and save the old one for when you want to see your pics/vids/etc. again.    Cons:  I'm not sure on your stand for this feature, but for some, the virtual keyboard of the dare is said to be kind of hard to use.  I got used to it after about a week, though.    The video feature of the Dare can only take frames in 30-second intervals, so if you want to take a long video, you have to take 30 sec frames and start over (which isn't too time consuming, actually)  The web browser is a little slow, but I think this is a minor flaw in such a great phone.       Also, when I was browsing for my phone at the store, through my experiences, I would highly recommend NOT getting the blackberry storm, just because the touch screen is almost IMPOSSIBLE to use, and it's features actually aren't really that good.  Don't get the Krave either, since in comparison to other touch screen phones like the Dare and Voyager, it isn't actually that good.  Oh, speaking of which, the voyager is also a really good phone, and the only difference between the dare and the voyager is that the dare is all touchscreen, while the voyager has a real keyboard.  It also has live tv streaming, which is useful to some.  I just think the Voyager design is a little too bulky.      Also, my friend loves her enV, but i think the main screen is a little small.  But otherwise, it has exactly the same features (besides the touch screen) as the voyager.    Also, the Vu and Prada are rip-offs, so please do not get them.  The dare is just as good as both of these phones, and is several hundred dollars cheaper.|`|BY02DhfWaa	i just got a samsung  verizon that takes pics eather pay as you go or a plan i love mine .|`|Mg6WPmZoaa	i would totally get the voyager i had that phone for awhile & liked alot!!  And dont get the enV i heard its gay.... but its your choice they are both really cool.!  :)|`|AA11197859	How about a Chocolate, the slidy ones or the flip ones. Or maybe a Juke. Jukes are very cute! I also recommend a Razr too. Or maybe a fancy one like the Dare or the Shine. These all are very good phones! Good luck finding one! :]

You should still consider a DSLR!|`|3mAgM405aa	For skateboarding, the following advanced bridge point and shoot digital camera is the way to go, especially because of the HD720 video with sound capability:    If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $315 at amazon.com.

If you don't have any experience using manual functions, you need not worry. Entry level DSLRs like Nikon D40 or D60 have automatic functions. DSLRs will prove useful as you learn more about photograhy. Point and shoot functions are quite limited.    The greatest advantage of point and shoot cameras over DSLRs is its size. Carrying a compact camera is very convenient.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Depends on which version of the 80 gb PS3 you have.  Did it come with Motorstorm or Metal Gear Solid 4?  If it did, then you can play PS2 games on it.  If it didn't, then it can't play PS2 games.      Does it have 4 USB ports or 2 USB ports?  If it's 4, then it can play PS2 games.  If it has 2, then it can't play PS2 games.    I think it would depend on the type of video.

Also, the main attraction to the blackberry is RIM's push email system... will you make use of it?

nA8l89GXaa	it's not possible but most phone company will go to voicemail after 20 seconds or so of ringing.  There used to be a way to extend it so it would ring longer before going to voicemail but i don't think that works anymore..|`|RCkeHaukaa	Do you mean ringBACK tone?....If so then I don't think that should matter since the other person is calling and just waiting for you to answer :)    But if you do mean an actual ringtone then yes it is possible....but some are just made long and others are not...or if your phone has a setting where you can record your own songs from the radio or whatevz and then set them as a ringtone...you can make them as long as you want.....Until you answer the person who is calling you.
ggGZf8hMaa	If you have to text something to a number to get the "free ringtone" you are most likely subscribing to a monthly plan (most are $9.99 a month for like 5 tones) The only way to get a 100% free ringtone is to go to http://www.ventones.com/ download the tone and put it in a Micro SD card and set it in your phone!

AA11346554	Yes, they do.  Manufacturers have gotten into the habit of "fudging" the numbers to make their products look superior.  Your new system measures in "total power", all six channels combined unlike your old system which measures each channel separately.  They also use cheaper drivers which are measured in 4olm rather than 8olm.  This effectively allows them to double the rated wattage.  The next way they fudge the numbers is in "total harmonic distortion."  While your old system was probably allowing for .1% total harmonic distortion, your new system probably allows for 10% total harmonic distortion.      When you take the total wattage of 1000 and divide it by six for each channel you are left with 166.6 watts per channel.  Divide that by 2 to compensate for the impedance fudge and you are left with about 83.3 watts per channel.  Divide the remainder by three to compensate for the "total harmonic distortion" fudge and you are left with a much more accurate real world rating of about 28 watts per channel.    The way the electronics industry has pulled the wool over the eyes of the general consumer is a travesty which can only be combated with knowledge.|`|QekY4ycuaa	The amounts of watts determines how loud it can become, not the amount that it outputs with the same amount of power (that would be efficiency).|`|ofpmRvHpaa	You may be mixing a few things.    Your old stereo was watts per channel but you read the total power output for your new unit.  This is not an apples to oranges comparison.    Power is variable and depends on a lot of things.     Example: One amp will produce:    75 watts using  8 ohm speakers  100 watts using 6 ohm speakers  150 watts using 4 ohm speakers    (Closer to zero the speakers - the more power it draws)    You need to make sure the power numbers are for ... 8 ohm speakers to properly compare them.    I have seen some Home Theater box systems brag about "POWERFUL 1,000 WATTS" - only to see they include 3 ohm speakers to get this large number.    In reality - the power from that system is about 37 watts per channel using a more standard 8 ohm speaker.    You gotta read the fine print to see how those power numbers were measured.

6JdjvwRUaa	Are there any error lights blinking from your console? If all 4 red lights blink at once it could mean your cable is not plugged in correctly. <br>  <br>  Are you using HDMI, Component, or the standard 3 prong?<br>  <br>  Have you recently moved it from an HDTV and left it on an HD setting?<br>  It might be broadcasting in 1080i or p and the T.V you have it on cannot output the signal.<br>  <br>  Edit-<br>  Make sure the colors are in the correct postions. A simple switch of blue and green would lead to a loss in picture.<br>  <br>  Try the 360 with the standard component cable. Or, try it on another T.V all together to see the outcome.|`|zmyZ9BgZaa	You should always just unplug your AV cable first, then plug it back in. If that seems to not work, see if there is a loose wire near the Video output jack (should be the yellow one, if not, the white one). My friend has this problem only with the sound. He has to prop his audio cable up with Chapstick to get it to work. And if both of those don't work, then you'll probably have to buy a new AV cable altogether. And alas, if that doesn't work, always just send it into Xbox to get it fixed, it will probably be an internal issue.

HekFanRvaa	IF YOU ARE USING 2 controllers, the problem is just a conflict between which is controller 1 or controller 2. If you can do things on XMB, go to Settings>>>Accessory Settings>>> Re-Assign Controllers and make the one in your hand as controller 1. You might need to do it as often as you plug in and out any other controllers on your PS3 icluding Guitar Hero Controllers or Rock band.

q3lzWKkXaa	Copying themes to a folder won't make them work, as the themes for N78 are a type of Symbian application and require installation. So, you'll need to install them before you can use them. You can install them using Nokia Application Installer or by following the given steps (on your phone) after transferring them to a folder in the memory-card:  1. Goto 'Menu' and select 'Tools' -> 'File manager'.  2. Select the memory card from the list of drives.  3. Browse the file-system and open the folder where you've copied the themes to.  4. Now, open the each of the themes (in .sis or .sisx format) one by one and follow the prompts/instructions that appear on the screen and install them.  After installation, you'll be able to find the themes in the list of themes in 'Settings' (Goto 'Menu' and select 'Tools' -> 'Settings' -> 'General' -> 'Personalization' -> 'Themes' -> 'General'). To use any of them, scroll to the theme and press 'Apply'. You can also get a preview of the theme by pressing 'Options' and then, selecting 'Preview'.  -  But, in case of wallpapers, you don't need to install them. Just copy them to any folder in the memory-card. And then, (on your phone),  Goto 'Menu' and select 'Tools' -> 'File manager', browse the file-system, open the wallpaper you want to use and press 'Options' and select 'Use image' -> 'Set as wallpaper'. After that, your phone will set it as a wallpaper, which may take a few seconds if it's a large image.|`|SZfAOWReaa	Actualy, u instal a theme in a phone.so you dont have to copy a .sis file anywhere in the fone. Just run the instaler, usin pc suite from Pc or move the .sis file to the mobile and run the file there.

4Pk6VNftaa	Saving will depend on the game.  Check the manual for details specific to the game you're playing.    Some games use autosave.  The game will warn you that it uses autosave and will usually have a small flashing picture to tell you it's saving your game.    Others will have an  entry in their menu to save.  Some games only let you save at certain points, however.    Also, although your PS2 has 2 memory card slots, many games are stupid and will only be able to save to slot  1 (the one on the left) so make sure you have your card inserted into that slot.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	It will have 2 things:    1) AUTOSAVE FUNCTION, this will automatically save your games at the appropriate save point    2) Manual save, will ask you to save or continue without saving    Some tips:    If you have a burnout save game on your MC (memory card) and "overwrite" it, the data will be erased, and the new data+the data before it will be save    8MB per card is the maximum (around 20 game saves, depends on the game)    Keep in mind, you can only save at a certain point in the game. Some games will let you pull up the pause menu and save there, but the majority will not, and will require you to complete said amount of tasks before you are allowed to save    Enjoy your first gaming console!|`|LywfC5y6aa	there should be a area in the game or in the start menu or it may be a game that autosave's. so just pay attention to what the game says. and your question is not dumb if you have never owned one before.|`|Vt02alabaa	on a ps2 memmory card some use an auto save others you use manual save there is about 2 different ways to know or to do it    1) some games you go to the pause menu and will have an option to save it and maybe you can go to the options of pause menu and save    2) if it autosave it should tell you before you can play or to know if it is autosave you might can go to the options before you start playing and see if it is autosave     but that's about the only way I know how to save

dUyBF4yOaa	well of course you wont have an ISO folder. The first thing you need in order to even attempt playing psp games is having custom firmware.

BUT, there are a whole lot of games in the PlayStation store that play directly off of your harddrive. Burnout Paradise and Socom: Confrontation are two of the games that are available on discs, but can also be purchased online and played without a disc.|`|XunCpomBaa	no you can't|`|LywfC5y6aa	no the game is downloaded to the hard drive to avoid load times.  not playable by hard drive.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	I think you misinterpreted this info. You install a portion of the game onto the Hard drive the first time you play it, to make the load times faster, because the Blu Ray drive in the PS3 reads at 2x (as a comparison, the 360 DVD drive runs at 16x).    If you could do that, then Sony would lose a heck of a lot of money.
EsdqLD9Saa	Well first off if you want one you need a camera that can double as a web cam, otherwise you can't get a live feed. Youtube can't support a live feed either... so I would recommend blogtv.com. If you want to do spfx on the show however there are going to be special programs, sorry, but I don't know of them.    oops just checked, the camera doesn't have to be any special camera. Just has to connect to computer.|`|WHyaWOn4aa	my suggestion..watch icarly!    you don't really need a special camera as long as it can connect to your computer..i think its called firewire or something|`|aLFJ57wkaa	Well, my friends and I just recently started a web show on Youtube called "Alice's Storytime". It took us several days to think of good ideas.   Here are some:            Randomness            Animal Centered            Music            Art            Skits  Anyway, we can't stream it live unfortunately and are trying to find a way to also, but we just post up the videos on a certain day. Hope this helped!
TPpTAKAdaa	A good way to avoid these calls is to just not answer, or block these people, if possible.    If you permanently want to scare them away from not prank calling you, get your brother (if you have one) or some other boy to answer when you know its one of them calling.  Tell him to say something really intimidating like "If you prank call one more time the police will be invovled.  I know where you live."    Another way to scare off prank callers is to have your parents answer.  My mom did this accidently.  She was like "Oh hi this is Mrs.______.  Would you like to speak with Delila?  This is _____(name of who's been bugging you), right?"    Good luck dealing with them :D|`|sZUNC9Ghaa	prank call them back..or say your calling the police LOL!|`|Zr3As3VNaa	I know that you don't want to fight back, but that is harassment. If i were in your position, I would tell my parents (which I hope you have already done), and leave the messages on your phone, without deleting them. Then, take the phone to the police, and they can get in trouble for what they are doing to you. I had similar problems, and the only way to get them to leave you alone is to either leave them alone, which you have tried, or to put a figure of authority between you and them. I promise that no-one will harass you once they've been threatened by a cop for harassing you, because it could land them a night in juvvie|`|2SRIv128aa	Tell them you're recording and will sue them for harassment if they don't cut the crap.|`|5nseONR7aa	They are bad people. Here is my e-mail address, because I really do want to help you. I have thousands of ideas. E-mail me as ASAP.    aask@sbcglobal.net    I already e-mailed all my friends this. Please e-mail me so I can help you. Really, I have this friend that does a lot with volunteering in after school support groups. I can have her help you, or me...    okay her is something my friend suggested...  Okay! Sounds like fun! Ummmmmm... Lets see....     1.) When they prank call her again, let her pretend to be a Swedish person.  2.) Whenever they call she should scream when she answers the phone.  3.) When they call dont answer? Then they will call again and she doesn't pick up. Then when they call the third time, make sure her mom anwsers and then they can get in trouble with their mom's!      I'll get some more 4 you...here are some of mine    1) get a cat or dog to bark into the phone every time they call  2) approach them at school from all different corners with your friends and tell them to lay it off  3) get a policeman to answer the phone, telling them to lay it off, then make a sound that sounds like chain-cuffs  and have to police officer say "These have been reserved for you guys"    Seriously, I'll get some more|`|Zt9ivjXIaa	u should just pick it up and say u are acting like a 2 year old and it s really bothering me lose my number or im calling the cops it will scare them away what i do

7igxiGrAaa	Yes, they can still steal money from the card. If you gave the number out you need to call your card company immediately and report that the number may have been stolen.  For furture reference, any legit source will NEVER ask for you card number unless you call them: IE you call Wachovia with a question and they tell you to enter your card number. Anyone that CALLS YOU should not ask for your card number. If they called you for real, they already have your account information in front of you - it's how they would know your phone number.  The most a company can legally ask you is to verify your address, name and last 4 digits of your social security. If they ask for more than this, question them as to why and do not answer any more than those items.        Check out snopes: http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/walmar...    Here's the government site for phone scams: http://www.ftc.gov/phonefraud which points out how to recognize and report a fraud.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	Yes it's a scam|`|1uvrkDWNaa	If that were a real call, VISA would have your information onhand and would not need to ask for it.  Yes, money can be stolen without giving the 3 digit number.  You got scammed.

I can charge all kinds of things over the web without the 3 digit security  . If some one calls you and asks for this information you should always be suspicious and hang up.|`|ND5KncX0aa	yes, because not all places require the security number on the back.  Never give out your personal information, especially when you were contacted by someone and not the other way around.
ilScrvPEaa	During the financial crisis Sony is desperate to reduce production costs. PS2 compatibility requires PS2 hardware. That's too expensive. :-(|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	Wait until April 2009 it will go down to $299.99 but NEVER is Sony going to bring back PS2 compatibility, unfortunately.    The reason is that the cost of putting the PS2 chip/CPU  and the PS2 graphics card in the PS3 was VERY expensive,  and as the PS2 only has about a year left (before it is  discontinued), Sony saw no reason to lose even more  money than they already are losing on the PS3, and  hence there is no backwards compatibility on PS3's today.|`|VcNHahtgaa	I heard that in the future, they will make a PS2 emulator for the current PS3's to play PS2 games. I heard that it is in the current PS3's but it is not unlocked.    I may be wrong, I don't know much about this.    You could probably find a used PS3 in Gamestops that can play PS2 games.    I am with your though, I'm disappointed you cannot play PS2 games anymore, but I still bought a PS3 because of the new games.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Some older models of the PS3 are backwards compatible, but they have been long discontinued. If you are willing to buy a used one you can get the backwards compatibility. The 60gig model is the best for that purpose.|`|9sRUf4zEaa	Judging by the additional information it seems you don't know that the 60gb ps3 was backwards compatible at one point (sorry if I'm wrong). Like the guy above said, the price to put the PS2 chip and the PS2 graphics card in the PS3 was very expensive and the PS2 only has about a year left before it's discontinued. So sony decided to just remove the backward compatibility for all the newer models and use the money saved to producing more games and to lower prices. I'm just hoping sony will come to their senses and put back the backward compatibility later.|`|785440e73a90380b1cea867ceab71780aa	No hope. Buy now.
c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.  http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j... ...  http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h... ...     The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.    http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5... ...  http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po... ...       For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)     There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.     This could be the best slim line camera with a viewfinder.  It uses a Rechargeable 960 mAh lithium-ion battery and ... It's PINK!  http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber... ...  http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/defau... ...     CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.  To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.     What gives a camera its picture quality?    The short answer is that it is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.     Lots of great camera tips in this link.   http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going... ...     My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic.      Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices.  Once you select a camera, read all about it in the owner's manual.  You can view owners manuals at this link, but will need to Login. http://www.retrevo.com/s/digital+camera ...

Fic6MjNbaa	I used to have a pearl, now have an iPhone, and my girlfriend has a curve so I've played with all of them. It really depends on what you're looking for in a phone. I personally like the iPhone better because of the 3G non-mobile internet. It displays every site how it actually is. Also, the application store is amazing. But, the phone has gotten old for me (had it over a year and a half) but that happens with everything for me, haha. The pearl is really nice and also small. If you absolutely hate big phones both the curve and iPhone are pretty big.  I suggest going to the store and holding them and playing around a little bit. But iPhone would be my suggestion. The blackberry was designed for business people on the run with email and what not, but imo the iPhone out did them big time.|`|kFoka1VZaa	i have had both the curve and the pearl then switched to the new g1 and all i gotta say is get the curve you will not regret it! i miss mine all the time and am looking forward to the new curve coming out feb. 11th.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	The curve, if you're talking about the 8900, is an excellent phone and it isn't as big as you might think. Yes, the Pearl's smaller but it's also less powerful. If you aren't worried about camera quality, wifi (unless you opt for an 8120 or 8220), clarity of screen and software stability go for the Pearl =)    I wouldn't touch the iPhone with a 10-foot pole, you can't even send a picture message with the thing or record video with the camera!|`|dXGvp5sVaa	The pearl does not have QWERTY, does that matter to you? The Curve is actually very sleek once you get used to it, and it is easily carried around in the back pocket or purse.
fCPdcWstaa	Well my economics teacher said that theres gonna be a price drop and its gonna cost 299.99 dollars, thats gonna be this spring so if i were you i'd wait. And if you get it earlier then get Killzone 2 and Ratchet and Clank. Ratchet and Clank for sure though cause its soo much fun and Killzone 2 looks really good. Gta 4 is good but only if you wanna play alone because its online play isnt that great to be honest  . . . or wait and get Prototype or get Call of Duty World at war. But yea i would say wait so you can save that 100 dollars and buy 2 more games. I already have a 40 gb one which i bought last March and i would want a new one with backwards compatibility if they do get a price drop. But thats just me. I would say wait though . . .|`|qMEqmEpTaa	id wait for the  price drop|`|LywfC5y6aa	you might want to buy one now because nobody knows how many gb's the new one might be.|`|3EGl95VQaa	i would suggest waiting till the price drop.

Your box is basically screwed. call xbox and let them know and see what they can do for you. 1-800-4my-xbox
e5548f5c8e0bdc120401df271d88959aaa	nuisance calls are illegal no matter where you live.  If it is so persistent, call the police and have them deal with it.
3CJAUyqPaa	No. The SR45 does not do "USB streaming" - if it does, the instructions are in the manual... not in the manual, not possible.
c84e3d7c6c8ecfe924819637cbf13e07aa	Well, considering you are able to ask the question here, it sounds like the server is down on xbox live or guitar hero. I would just wait and try again later. If you keep getting the error, try typing it word for word into google. You'll probably find a solution.
557c65c1d2224dfe3c2fe5c6f798e6e5aa	It is not the lights that are special but the switch.  Pneumatic time delay switch.    Here is an example of the type of switch....    http://www.ryness.co.uk/ProductDetails.a...

I tried .com, .net., .org and just for the hell of it, i tired .gov and they dont work|`|iwLND8URaa	It might be the server. It can sometimes do that.   Just try refreshing the browser, or waiting five minutes*.          *New movies are added every so often in five minute lengths.|`|Blk5WasNaa	i think it might have got shut down.
zX0dYCfQaa	While I do not think that you should go forcing the RROD just to get the warranty extension, the E74, I am pretty sure, is not covered y warranty so that is your decision. If you want any help on the E74 matter go here: http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?s... That site covers all (or most of) the Xbox problems. I hope this helped.|`|c1sRWiX3aa	The only thing the additional two years of warranty covers is the RROD death...nothing else.    But from the way you worded your question it sounds as if your 360 is less than a year old right now...which means your 360 is still under warranty for the E74 error you are getting.     I would contact Microsoft via either the website or the phone and get it sent in before the warranty runs out.
AA11635143	Record all her phone calls or keep a written record of the date and time of her calls.  Warn her that if she calls again you will go to the Police dept. and file "telephone harassment" charges against her.  If she continues, file the charges.  It won't cost you anything but it will cost her plenty and she will have a restraining order placed against her by the judge.  If she violates it by calling you, she serves her sentence in jail.    That should take care of the little twit.|`|lLGwzChtaa	You should contact telephone exchange; or atleast ask customer care..
5Bbp8Z1xaa	the only way to hook it up if u have a like 300 foot online cord or u buy a 100 dollar wireless thing at a gamestop store or like wal-mart or something. if u dont like wireless, then get that 300 foot cord and ask ur dad or if ur are a parent ask someone that knows how to  put he cord through the house to plug ur xbox. thats how i did it the cord goes through ur roof and walls and like that.|`|AA12146249	to run your xbox and computer you need to get wifi router if you have cable in your room I would run internet to your room to wifi router run ethernet cable over to xbox then get a wifi card for your home computer. or keep it up stairs to a router then you need wifi adapter for xbox which retails for $100 you can get for $80 from amazon. it would be cheaper to get wifi card for computer they run less then $50.
YKc3YrxXaa	I guess that you'll just have to buy an official one... I don't there would be a way to tell. I mean my friend bought a Madcatz one and it worked fine... If you sent the controller back to walmart before you opened it up, they would've gave you a full refund. I think that you have to call up Walmart and see what they have to say about it.    Hope this helps!!
zDNHCvCcaa	Should be able to click a button right next to the answer itself.
zDNHCvCcaa	Definitely good enough. My current computer is much slower than your build, and I run it fine.|`|tbxBuATwaa	Your graphics card isn't made for gaming, you should be able to run on low settings, maybe medium; but expect sluggish frame-rates, especially when zombies swarm all over your screen.
r4FJjEGiaa	That's pretty much it. You won't have a warranty if anything happens, but if you take care of it - no need to worry.  However, you may run into issues trying to set up your email on the bold because T-mobile does not support the service books for the bold - it won't be automatic. What you need to do to get your email set up is log into your bis account and update the pin and imei. Go to my.t-mobile.com and log in - there are couple things you need to look for here. First at the top of the page where it says your name and current phone - change it to the blackberry 8900 (cuveII). Then, at the bottom of your main page, go to "Set up Blackberry Internet & Email." There it will ask you to update the information, which you can find in the status when go to options. - Have fun. - send me a message if you have questions.
qGfAlDd2aa	SMPTE Color Bars.|`|ofpmRvHpaa	The color bars are one of about ... 3 different test patterns.

I understand where you're coming from but really the only way the wii and ps2 are similar is the graphical capabilites. However "The Conduit" (alien shooter coming out this year) should prove to us the wii has been underestimated
c84e3d7c6c8ecfe924819637cbf13e07aa	Your best bet will be to call them. If you are leasing the boxes, you should only have to pay for HD once, but pay for the box rental on both. The biggest advantage to leasing it and not buying it outright, is that if anything goes wrong with it, they will just give you a new one. If you buy it, it's your problem once the warranty is gone. Also, if a newer, better model comes out you should be able to swap the rental unit out for a new one without much hassle.|`|LddkW0JFaa	As I understand it, DirecTV will charge you a rental fee whether you lease a box or go to a store and buy one. You can certainly call DirecTV and find out if you can use the one DVR for both TVs.
mfRfxacsaa	I assume you have one cable from the antenna and one from the satellite which then connect to a splitter with one cable running from the splitter to the TV.  If this is what you have, then you need to remove the antenna cable from the splitter and connect it to the digital converter box's antenna input.  Next connect the output from the converter box to the now open antenna input on the splitter.|`|UQWusO1waa	my tv has both a antenna jack and a video input jack. my converter is connected to the ant jack and the sat box is connected to the the vid jack. to watch sat. I have to change the video input(using the converter box remote)when i switch between the two.I discovered this buy accident after i hooked up my converter box. I had disconnected the dish antenna cable that went to my tv and hooked the converter to the tv jack to discover that the dish was still working. I was very confused, then realized it dish box was also connected to the vid input on the tv. also i have an old tv.|`|IHBTtcShaa	your sat. shouldnt need it so just put it one the ant.|`|IqPB4QTgaa	Put the converter before the splitter.
ZFuiy3Tsaa	If it still under warranty, contact Microsoft. If it is not under warranty, send it to a place such as Rapid Repair or replace the device.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	If your TV has no input, then you can't play a PS3 or PS2 on it.|`|UphoLYGYaa	don't know about the viewsonic brand, but i have a tv similar to this w/ no av input.  when i want to play on that tv i do this:    hook the ps3 into a VCR that has av inputs.    then connect the vcr to the tv w/ a standard cable cord.   tune the tv to whatever channel for the VCR signal,   then on the VCR select whatever line the av input is.    the video quality degrades the more bs you pass it through, but if that's what you have to do that's what you have to do.

QekY4ycuaa	The resolution is probably too high for your tv.|`|UNUJNgHxaa	Here is something you can try, Turn off both the TV and the input source. Unplug them both and wait for about 5 min. This will reset both pieces of equipment. Plug all the cables in before you plug the TV in the wall. Then plug in everything turn them on and see if the issue has gone away. By doing this you are resetting the circuit boards. Good luck and I hope this works for you.|`|7cd01ff8b8a793e244b9b62cc849b368aa	The resolution is probably set too high for your TV.  Check the component which uses the HDMI and set it to a lower resolution.

ZKNTTuxCaa	At T-Mobile, we let you suspend your service for up to 30 days (to prevent anyone from using the phone) and then reactivate your existing number and account on your new phone. As far as actually getting the new phone, you can either file an insurance claim (if you have insurance) or do an upgrade or just buy a phone elsewhere and buy a new SIM.     But we don't give you a free phone, or actually cancel your service. (unless you pass the 30 days suspension without reactivating the number, then it's canceled automatically, and then you do still have an early termination fee if you were under contract.)    I think it's probably pretty similar with other companies as well.|`|gIcg7Ug2aa	They get to sell you another phone.|`|m06TDTtTaa	I have tried many different services.      Most of them will ask you if you purchased the insurance for the phone to protect you in cases like this.  But most will not be very cooperative because they will want you to buy another phone at retail pricing...not a discounted price.    It really depends on the one that you have and who you get to speak to.  I often go to the cancellation selection because they have more authority to do things for their clients because they are trying to keep you.      There are many places out there that have phones that people have brought in and they sell them at reasonable prices.    hope this helps and good luck!!!
JITEIt88aa	lcd|`|AA12146249	I you play fast paced game you would be better off with LCD. Plasma has a slower frame refresh would cause a more blur then LCD|`|4HTbXMU6aa	LCD is better than the plasma.

I've used them before and although they are not as good as the xbox headset, they get the job done (for $10!!!!)  Otherwise you are going to have to rip apart other headphones, mics, and headsets then do some wire splicing and soldering.  That would not be fun considering that the wires and circuits are very tiny.  I was able to find a cool earbud style for about $15 that I enjoy.
XNGsrOYraa	no, your parents cant read your texts. if you delete them once they are sent there is no way of them accessing your private stuff. part from anything else if they try and look at your stuff via a computer, its iligal so your phone should block any 1 trying 2 look at your stuff or at least it should give u a warning that some1 is hacking into your folders  good luck :) hope i helped.|`|ij9N9r5waa	I'm not saying your dad did this, but myverizon.com you can click details on the bill and read every text in full, see every phone Number called or received.

HwujORd2aa	Olympus has some great pocket sized ones that are shock proof and waterproof.  That means you can use it when you go swimming or snorkeling!  There's even a setting for underwater.  You can get them for less than $300.  They have video on them too, which is pretty good.  Check out their website or google Olympus waterproof cameras.  Be sure to read the instructions carefully for how to take care of it once you're out of the water.  You have to set it in fresh water then wipe it down.  Also, don't forget to get the 2MB card and bring a spare.  Have a great trip.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	http://www.luminous-landscape.com/review...

dkCgEuzqaa	You maybe a iphone video lover.Come on, not only one way can solve this.iPone can only support mpeg4 or mp4 video,so you must make sure the videos you want to play on your iPhon is mp4 format .You need to have a 3rd party tool to help you to convert dvds and video into mp4 or h264 format, then sync to ipod.

9lVjWPGqaa	yes as long as its in the US...      edwardzslady duh|`|twPZBsH2aa	There should be no distinction between local and long distance calls. It's all based on minutes used vs. the number in your plan. All minutes are the same, whether local or long distance. If they cost you, they cost you for both, if you are using plan minutes or free minutes, they're free regardless of local or long distance.    The idea of "long distance" calling is basically non-existent on cell phones.
zDNHCvCcaa	First make sure your video drivers are all up to date.    If that doesn't solve the problem:    Try downloading this registry fix I found on GTAForums.com (link in sources)  After you download the archive, run the 384 MB version. It should do the trick.    In case you don't know how to open a rar file (many people do not) download a program called 7Zip and open it with that.|`|4YlbvMODaa	RESC10 means== Out of video memory - Please re-boot your system    the other error codes  RMN20 - Windows Vista: Need to have Service Pack 1 or higher to proceed.

Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:    1) Sharing  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours siftingthrough thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com
ZtECjEPyaa	something is obviously wrong...try turning your phone off, taking out your battery (then put it back in) and then turn your phone back on. if that doesn't work, contact your phone company and get help from them over the phone.

If you don't have a dataplan they will charge based on the amount of data you download, not for the time spent online as incorrectly stated by another answerer.    If you have Facebook open all day, but are doing nothing on it, you will just be charged for the initial login screens.

It's an incredible game and I highly recommend it.    My favorite more recently purchased game though would be Shaun White Snowboarding.  It's great fun to play using the Wii Fit balance board but is even a lot of fun to play using the Wii remote too.  The controls work very well either way (though it is easier to use the remote but more fun to use the board) and is tons of fun in split screen multiplayer mode (locally, not online enabled) because you can compete against each other or work cooperatively to complete challenges (such as total combined points for a trick run or total combined time for a speed run).|`|xZA35cqraa	mario galaxy mario kart and animal crossing    what about you?    http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|NfnkzwTKaa	Okami.

2LHgmq97aa	PC and here are reasons...    With the Mac you are paying significantly more for lower spec hardware.  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION. It can do just about any cool effect a Mac can do and more...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...  (there is no flickering when you use it like on the video, not sure why the person has the flicker)  3) Like the Mac OS X Doc? google/yahoo Cairo Dock, avant window navigator.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2...  4) It is faster/MORE SECURE. Surf the internet and even run some windows programs with Wnehq/Crossover..  http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-v...  For easy instructions on setting up Dual Boot http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windo...    VIRUSES  Mac OS X has viruses (which is significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    SECURITY  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.  http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/so...  http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/2...  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft...    QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-op...

Now I know that sounds like opinionated or whatever.  But i have had lots of experience at both, and have become a computer programmer.  I know hold the answer to what is good and bad about both pc and mac.  Mac has stabler os system, however and never crashes but this is because Mac thinks its way too cool and is composed fully of their own hardware unlike a pc.  Mac is also simpler and easier to use when in opposition to the pc, but also a lot more restrictive.  Mac is better for media in general as it comes with a lot of good software for free.  However repair for macs suck you can never repair a mac yourself as easy as a pc the cases self destruct when you attempt to open them.  PC's are way better at gaming and dominate that field entirely, PC's can have more processor power, and also function much better with drivers of software and excessories such as projectors.  Pc's also function much better as a whole despite possible crashes and lack of proper unification between different hardware.  But pcs you can update yourself and hardware wise are very people friendly as macs ain't.  So there you have it, unless you're an incompotent computer user, which is nothing to be ashamed of, or only use you computer for media, then the PC is a much better computer.|`|SPOuVDE0aa	Mac.|`|AA10412319	pc all the way....macs kinda confuse me(personal opinion)

bYlEqiKVaa	NOOOOOOOOOO.  I work at Best Buy in the camera department and every year, for the past 3 years, the camera we get the most returns on is consistently always the sony t-series!!!!!  Aside from the small embedded lens, this line of sony cameras has an underdeveloped iris, meaning less light gets into the camera's sensor, which, for you means, a poorer quality image.  And the sensor, my God, tiny and useless.  Sony tries to compensate by overly backlighting (artificially, i might add) all the images so that the pictures appear brighter, but really, they're not true to life colors at all.  Go with a Canon from the SD series.  They have phenomenal sensors, fast processors, great features for the money, and are all around outstanding.  Go into a store and try each camera out.  The Canons may not be as stylish as the Sonys, but are you paying for performance or the hip factor?  Ask the people who work in the camera department (the ones who don't look like they could possibly have double-digit IQs), and I'll wager dollars to donuts that they prefer the Canons over the Sony T-series.    Okay, that's it for my rant.  But there is literally no camera I would recommend less than this line of Sony.  Sorry.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	sony touchscreen, what ?. does it have a model  |`|eoDWzUNxaa	Yes I would recommend it. I have the dark gray one and the pictures are amazing. There are many programs on it like the smile button, it makes frowning people smile. Also it has a great 4GB internal memory, so if you forget your memory card you have a ton of space. The only con is that it attracts fingerprints, but again which touchscreen product doesn't. If your wondering about scratches, it rarely gets them. I take my camera everywhere, in every bag, pocket, adventure, and it only has one very very small scratch on it (unnoticeable unless you really stare at it).      Hope I helped. :)

If you want just an upgrade from your nano, the newer nanos are a good bet.    If you want something fancy and are willing to shell out the money for special features, the iPhone/iTouch is actually a lot of fun.    Personally, I've had both the iPhone and the iPod video (classic's predecessor) and both are fine. The iPhone only has 8 GB, but I think that's around the nano's capacity anyways so it shouldn't be too much of a jump for you.|`|a2UtRCSFaa	Ipod touch/IPhone

Not to mention the game is a blast for parties and such.    Animal Crossing- if you like the sims, you might like this.  if you dont like Sims, you probably wont like this.    Resident Evil 4-  A good solid game, but I would buy umbrella chronicles instead.

UAYzLyN4aa	DVD recorders cannot record in high def. The format does not permit it.     BluRay could do it, but there are no standalone "BluRay recorder" boxes as there are DVD recorder boxes.     To my knowledge, there is nothing you can do here without a monthly subscription, except for an HTPC (see below).     What you don't want: You could get a DVR from the cable or satellite company... either would have a monthly fee. Oh... you said over-the-air.     You also don't want an HD Tivo. It could do the OTA recording. But it too has a monthly fee (to access the program guide information).     How are you with computers? You could put together an HTPC. Since you only want to record over-the-air, you can use an ATSC tuner/capture card. SageTV, BeyondTV, MythTV, or even Windows MCE will all work. No monthly fee, but you do have to set up and maintain the machine.
Cl8FwsI2aa	Pubescent kids.|`|mb3ooc3uaa	That tells you the age range of who is playing the game. Most of the people who play Halo3 are in the range of 10-18 years old I would guess. They are just immature. One of the last times I played Halo3 I got into a 4v4 game, 3 on my team had the same tag. One of them started making fun of my rank cause it was low, I just don't play it much. I ended up doing better then him. Halo3 is not that good. Halo2 was so much better. I think Bungie realized that and thats why they are coming out with that expansion type game.|`|NIhV09qDaa	because halo 3fags like to tbag|`|R6Civz9kaa	Since Halo 3 is old now, every normal person got bored of it and moved on.

fMfBAgOUaa	The difference is the "curve" of the increase when you turn it. Linear pots are exactly what they are named, a linear increase. Turn it half way up, and it puts out 50% output. Log pots have a different curve (its hard to explain, you would have to see an image to know what i am talking about.). They are designed to increase based on the way the human ear percieves the increase. So on a log pot, turn it half up and it might put out around 65% output. The curve is sharp at first (1/10 of the way up might put out 25% output). and rolls off slowly at the top (8/10 of the way up puts out about 90%). So without confusing you more.... if you are replacing the volume pot, use a log pot. If you are replacing the tone pot, use linear.|`|1Gj0uKxzaa	With a linear pot (potentiometer), the volume scale is linear meaning that the difference in how much the volume changes is the same all along the scale. That is, if the volume is all the way off and you move it a quarter of an inch, the volume will go up by the same amount than if it was at 50% and you moved it the same distance.     With a log pot, the volume scale is logarithmic meaning that the difference in volume when you move it, say a quarter of an inch is different when you are closer to the off position than it is when you are closer to the on position.     Which you choose is, to some extent a matter of preference though I couldn't tell you what the percentage of people choosing one over the other is - may be that most people prefer one or the other... Probably a factor in the decision is how the ear perceives differences in audio - that is do people notice the same when you increase 10 decibels no matter what the volume is or, if its already at 40db, do they notice an additional 10db less, etc.

33121fc0c2bea9ea4d671e5e2438e785aa	Sorry if this is going to sound discouraging... For which I apologize in advance, but...    Ideas are worthless. Just like in Hollywood, and in patent system, only IMPLEMENTED ideas are worth something.     You can learn programming by yourself, bazillion difference resources on the web for that. Even free compilers, from Microsoft no less.     Even game toolkits with which you can make primitive games, but none are free now. Gamemaker is now commercial, as are DarkBASIC and similar toolkits.     And you're NOT going to make something without 1) experience and/or 2) education. As you said you don't want education, and you don't have any experience, I really really *HATE* to say this, but you've got nothing, and will not achieve anything either.     ---  Kasey C, PC guru since Apple II days  There's too much blood in my caffeine system.|`|nVdYIHhzaa	you aren't gonna do that with out years of college or an expensive computer program and LOTS of time to sit around and not have a life|`|b4VWLqmWaa	Yeah without college and lots and lots of practice and a touch of genius you ain't gonna do nothing.  If you want their are some free engines you can download that let you kinda make your own game or virtual world but doing it from scratch is hard and not easy to do.  And by not easy i mean impossible if you don't go to a college or university.  In Crysis, a video game you might know, with the best graphics ever, there is more programming in one tree than all of the coding for all games on the old nes together.  yeah millions of lines of codes.
c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	Leave the memory card in the camera as it is quite safe there, but observe the cautions below when it is removed.  Also, the batteries mentioned below will hold charge for one year and keep the camera settings.    CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select then click Stop and OK.    The batteries mentioned below are new formula NiMH batteries that will hold charge for one year when not used.  Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like them at first, but have 12 of these batteries that are over five years old and are still as good as new.  Higher mAh batteries still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.     A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the last link.  Those batteries are still going strong after four months of casual use and have not been recharged.     Click this link for complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts.   http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...     Camera reports batteries low, but is it low charge or bad electrical contacts? Overcharging can ruin good batteries!  The secret to making digital cameras work better is having good electrical contacts between batteries and camera.      CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.  To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.     NiMH batteries should be recharged when camera reports batteries low.  Old batteries can discharge over night, but may provide normal service immediately after being charged.  Battery pairs no longer usable in cameras may work well in flashlights.  Do not drop batteries on a hard surface or allow voltage below one volt to prevent polarity reversal.     Never touch battery ends or camera electrical contacts.  Oil from fingers will contaminate contacts.  Use batteries in matched pairs of same brand and rating.  Do not mix old and new batteries.  New will only do as well as old.     Digital cameras reset to original settings if batteries are removed for one minute. Time varies with function/camera. Check display/setup menu for non-auto functions and date/time. Remove extra memory to eliminate this as a possible problem.  Insert fully charged/cleaned batteries and restart camera. The ultimate non-physical repair for software-using devices is reset by removing power ... VCR/DVD players one month.

qrB0QxN8aa	It depends on what you think makes the console win.  If by win you mean make the most money and have the top selling video game ever then yes (the top selling game is not GTA IV it is wii sports there are more copies of wiiSports than copnsoles in use that can play GTA).  If you mean best hardware then no but no one really counts that.  If you mean most hardcore gamers then... er... no one can really answer that. 360 has the most people that will call them hardcore gamers in polls online.  But the thing is a lot of hardcore gamers don't go online and vote in poles and things like that so PS3 and Wii could easily be winning on that front.  If by win you mean have the biggest audience then yes.  The wii sells to everyone women, men, little kids, seniors, everyone.  As long as you can wave a stick you can play Wii.  If by win you mean have the most fun games then that is up to interpretation.  In conclusion I would saay this generation is basically between PS3 and Wii.  Why leave out 360? It only has shooters when they go out of style which they will Xbox will die because all of their major series are ultra-bloody shooters.  PS3 will have the well awaited games such as LittleBigPlanet.  Wii will have all of its franchises except for metroid which will still probably thrive.  So 360 nice knowin' ya.|`|ca1o8Ylsaa	I think the Wii has a very high chance of wining.If look at the past you can easily tell that the ps2 won yet it was the weakest console looking at right now the Wii is the weakest and its selling way more than the ps3 and more than the xbox 360.Also the Wii is getting tons of great games so I don't see any other console that will take down the Wii.|`|C7rV71Cjaa	Saleswise the Wii has pretty much locked up as the best selling console this generation. It has sold double the amount of PS3's and 18 million more than the 360. As for the games, the war is still going on but the Wii needs more better games from third parties because Nintendo can only make so many games. But this year is looking great for the Wii especially from Sega which has The Conduit, Madworld, The House of the Dead Overkill, and Sonic and the Black Knight being released before the end of the 1st half of the year. The PS3 and Xbox 360 are both great and I do like them a lot but they're both a lot the same and the difference really just comes down to the games and the price. The 360 is cool and has the best online there is but it cost money to get it and the 360 has too many hardware problems. The PS3 has free online play and many of the games that are on the 360 are on the PS3 but its the most expensive console out there and it is also the lowest selling and has the least exclusive titles. The Wii stood out and proved that hi def graphics don't make a game great but how enjoyable and fun it is. There are many great games to choose from for all kinds of people. Who knows, maybe somehow the 360 or PS3 will go through some amazing thing and be number one but I will always love my Wii and wha it has to offer me. I support owners of any system because the point of video games is to have fun.|`|RfCn67dAaa	although the wii is a great console i believe that the xbox's will PWN everything!|`|4EV5RQDvaa	Wii has already won the war.

Mario games are always kid friendly. I have an 11-year-old, and that's what we got him.    Mario Party 8 is great for the whole family. It has mini games, and most of the games aren't too hard to play. Also, Wii Play and Wii Music are great for kids too, plus, they're also fun for adults to play as well. The down side is that they're a little on the expensive side. Mario Kart Wii is awesome. It's the  1 sold game for the Wii, and you'll have hours of fun with it. You can play it as a family, play the computer, or even play people all over the world.    There's also a Nerf shooting game. It's fun, and it costs around $35-$40. I hope this helps.     If you have a game store in your mall, you can normally get used games there pretty cheap, and they're guaranteed to work. Also, the games that are $50 in the stores you can get brand new on Ebay for about half that price. That's one of the best routes to go.    If you see M&M Cart, it's not worth you time or money.

These games are SHOVELWARE. Awful games, made cheaply, for nothing but profit. Ugly & unplayable, just avoid at all costs. Before buying, check a website called "IGN.com". It offers reviews for most Wii (as well as every other console) games. The higher the score, the more they recommend it.    Here's my best-of list.  Super Mario Galaxy - The absolute best Wii game ever, Mario is back, and he's in space. Amazing to look at, and even more amazing to play.  Boom Blox - The best multiplayer game on the system. Think Jenga, but taken to whole new levels. The goal is to either destroy, or protect, towers made of virtual blocks. The multiplayer is addictive & offers tons of options, and it only requires ONE remote (You can still use several if you want).  Resident Evil 4 - This one's not for the kids. AT ALL. Purely for the adults, and available at a suprisingly cheap price ($30!), this is a horror gaming CLASSIC. Frightening, and addictive.    You'll be able to enjoy all 3 games.

AA10594501	The rules regarding antennas for apartments only restrict you to not modify the premises or place antennas in any "common" areas. If you're up against some homeowner's association CC&Rs, go tell them to pound sand. You're completely within your rights to have a visible antenna. Since the channel range has been reduced to 7-51 for most of the country, you may be able to get away with a smaller antenna than normal. Of course, if you're not in a detached house, you may not be able to point the antenna in the right direction.

kVeu3nfwaa	How close will you be sitting to this TV?  If the answer is about 7 feet away of more then you are wasting your money getting 1080p, at about that distance (6.6 feet for 32" and 7.7 feet for 37") the human eye can no longer tell the difference between 720p and 1080p. You have to sit a lot closer than that to get the full benefit.    Between samsung and sharp I would normally go with samsung for displays.  Also take a look at cnet.com, they have some very in depth reviews of LCD TVs.    Finally I know you're not getting an HDMI cable right now but for future reference; don't fall for the massively overpriced monster cables. The people who tell you they are better are normally the people who can't admit to themselves that they just paid $120 for a $8 cable.    Try somewhere like monoprice.com, I've only used them a couple of times but have no complaints about the products or the price.|`|UPkEWzFcaa	I recommend at least a 42'' 1080p 120Hz tv set with a monster m serries hdmi cable you will love the sound and picture quality plus the 120Hz is a must for xbox good luck oh and look into Sony
4Pk6VNftaa	This happens when ESPN-HD is showing something that isn't in HD, but wants to still give you a widescreen image without black bars on the sides.    So, rather than just broadcast that non-HD footage in SD, they add those sidebars to it, and then broadcast the resulting image at 720p so they can claim it's "HD".    If you watch, say, CBS-HD, when they break for commercial, you'll notice that many of the commercials have black bars on the sides of the screen.  This is because the commercial itself is not in HD.  ESPN-HD's strategy eliminates the black bars, but if you ask me, it just looks silly.    As the HD movement marches on, things like this will disappear as eventually everything will be in HD.|`|3XPXm2njaa	ya they do

qHEpR92Gaa	Most TVs have a parental control lock that can be set to prevent children from watching specific television shows. In order to activate or deactivate the controls, you need to know the four digit security code or parental lock control password. If you forget the number you chose or if the lock gets set accidentally, it is still possible to unlock the TV.    Turn on the TV and grab the remote. In most cases, you will need the original remote to unlock the TV if you aren't sure of the unlock code. If you don't have the original remote, you will need to purchase one.   Step2Look at the screen. If you see a blank screen with a red key on the bottom of the screen, press 'Function' and 'Mute' at the same time. This should unlock the channel. This is an option for people who want the TV to stay locked but, want to be able to bypass the lock to watch a certain show or channel. All other channels will remain locked and the TV will fully lock when it is turned off.   Step3Unlock all of the channels on the TV by entering the factory reset code. There are three main reset codes that TV manufacturers set. These are 0711, 6688 and 3308. Try each one until you find the one that works. This will reset the TV to original factory settings. When you do this, you will loose any information that you have stored in the TV, such as favorite channels, automatic timers and the clock. You will have to go through the full initial set up.   Step4Call the technical support service number in your owner's manual if none of those codes work. A technician can help you troubleshoot the television because the problem may not be the locking control. When you call, make sure that you have the model number and serial number of the TV.   Step5Take your television to a TV repair shop. In some cases, a professional who access to wiring diagrams for your television set may have to rewire certain components in order for the television to unlock. This is usually the case when the TV locks by itself while it is on.     Never try to rewire a TV yourself unless you have and understand a wiring diagram for your television. You can damage components that are very costly to replace if you make a mistake.|`|BE6v12pmaa	Log on to toshiba.com and click on questions and answers.

2sMA3HQCaa	As originally wired (pre-modular), most phone instrument cords had three wires: green, red, and yellow. Red and green are the "talk" conductors (just as now), and the yellow wire was used for different ringer modes on party lines and such. Generally, it was connected to the same terminal as the green wire at the baseboard terminal block, which typically only had two wires anyway. When you changed to the modular cord you probably either replicated the same wiring colors, or perhaps connected only the (new) red and green wires, since they are actually the only ones used. In either event the yellow ringer wire -- and thus the ringer -- is now connected to nothing.    You'll need to go back into the phone, locate where the original yellow wire was (perhaps terminal "G"), and internally jumper it to the same terminal as the old (and new) green wire (hopefully terminal "L1"). Or, if there is only one wire on terminal "G" and it comes from the ringer, you can simply move that wire to the green/L1 terminal instead of fabricating a jumper.    The new modular yellow and black wires should be taped off and not connected inside the phone at all. Good luck!

At the rate things are going they'll be able to take all our pictures and look at them for us too, so we'll be free to get on with life.    They do record things very faithfully though. Image stabilisation means that videos don't jiggle about quite as badly as they used to when the camera moves around. It's still irritating to watch, yet when we walk about our brain completely smooths that out. I don't know how often the brain scans the signals from the retina. Is it continually aware or is the image built up and presented to our consciousness at a certain frame rate.    I'm way out of my depth here.

w4I9oj2Maa	The problem you have is caused by the slight difference in the transmission frequencies of the sound and picture signals. They're always paired and a fixed distance apart for each 'channel' in the UHF spectrum.   This separation is different for the UK ones than it is for the NZ/Oz ones.     If you use the tv 'fine tune' controls then you will probably be able to get great sound but a crummy picture.    The only work-around to this situation is to buy a Freeview or Satellite or Cable box and connect it up to the SCART on your TV set.  The signal from those boxes will provide a standardized Picture and Sound signal that your TV set can work with...    Your tuner isn't bad, it's just not designed to recieve your signal and process it like it did in the UK.

ssoZ33XIaa	Well, it depends what kind of storage capacity you are looking for.  There are very few high capacity, hard-drive based players left on the market.  The Zune is certainly a good option, particularly if you are looking for something with a very large hard drive.  You can get it in an 80GB model and a 120GB model.  If you can have less storage capacity than that, take a look at the Creative Zen or Zen X-Fi.  The two players are very similar, but the X-Fi has some additional features including built-in sound enhancement technology.  You can get the Zen in a 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32GB model, and the X-Fi in an 8, 16, or 32GB model.  Both will support high capacity SD cards for memory expansion, which means that you can add up to 16GB of additional memory at a time.  There may be larger SD cards out there, but 16 is the largest I've seen lately.  The Sandisk Sansa Fuze or View are good options as well.  The Fuze is available in 2, 4, and 8 GB models, and the View in 8, 16, and 32GB models, and both support high capacity micro SD cards for memory expansion.  I think those are available in up to 16GB as well.|`|uY8E0nVCaa	Don't get a Zune because it's as pricy as the iPods and tbh iPods are better, face it. Wi-Fi, App Store, Free Applications for the iTouch Legally from iTunes (Games), Jailbreaking, RockBox, iPod Linux much more, etc, etc.    If money is a problem why not get a cheap $50 CAD/USD iPod Shuffle. My sister got me the 1GB for my birthday and it's awesome.    I can attach it to my bicycle helmet since it has a clip, also my pants, and it's so tiny teachers can't even see it (if you're a student).    Don't get one of those fake looking China iPods, they are a knockoff scam and will break in 4 weeks.    I recommend getting one of them Sansa or Philips players at Costco, I trust them both.    Not so long ago at Costco I saw an 8GB Philips Audio and Media Player at $99.99 with a nice screen.    But I find 8GB is not enough for my movies so for $250 bucks you can get a 120GB 6.5th Generation iPod classic which I highly recommend if you're a movie person like moi.    Good luck.|`|3NdNpoqlaa	you should consider a "Creative Zen" or a "Zune" mp3 player.  both havw video playback capabilities.    i'm not sure what it's called but there is an mp3 player with bluetooth, which makes it easier to transfer files without the use of software.|`|alDqf8DAaa	I know that the music website Rhapsody, is coming out with their own.  And Zunes are pretty good though.|`|3csUXUzCaa	wow my friend was in the same boat as you except Apple didn't let her put even a small warranty on the iPod after they had sent it in 3 times before that.     But I used to use somthing that said either GP4 or G4 on it. They have many MP3 players that you can always trust and they come in differnt styles and sizes. And if the size you got wasn't enough, then you can always get a memory card in any size as well. They're awesome quality and the sound is pretty good on them.        You can find them definatly @ Wal-mart, at stores like Radio Shack, Circuit City ( Which by  the way is closing down all or their stores this year) Twitter, and places like that     Good luck!!|`|jP3KDR0yaa	I had dropped this in water, washed it in the laundry multiple times, and fell on my skateboard listening to it. Still works perfectly It is cheap and is only 1 1/2 inches high. Its called the sansa clip, anywhere from $39.99 (1gigabite)-$59.99(4 gigabites)  Another suggestion (to go w/ it) is get rhapsody to go. You pay $15.00 a month and download all the songs you want.    Here's a link for the mp3 player  http://www.sansa.com/players/sansa_clip    Just google rhapsody if you are interested in that

v3QalJKfaa	The Monthly Unlimited plan which is $50 for unlimited nationwide talk, text, mms, and walkie-talkie includes calling any phone in the usa - whether mobile or landline. No hidden fees, contracts or credit checks.<br>  <br>  It runs on the Nextel iDEN network - which is a strong nationwide network. Here are two quotes to consider: <br>  <br>  “Based on an independent third-party drive-test study of the top 50 most populous U.S. markets as of Oct. 2008, there is an imperceptible difference – less than one percentage point – among the dropped call rates of the Verizon Wireless, AT&T and T-Mobile wireless carrier networks and the Nextel National Network.”<br>  <br>  Boost Mobile Has Fewest Dropped Calls, as compared to Cricket and Metro PCS:<br>  ? Cricket has more than 4x as many dropped calls than Boost**<br>  ? Metro PCS has more than twice as many dropped calls than Boost**<br>  <br>  *Coverage not available everywhere. Network reaches over 274 million people.<br>  **Based on independent third party drive test data from Feb-Oct 08 for the 19 common Boost/Cricket and the 9 common Boost/MetroPCS markets within the top 50 most populous U.S. markets<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps,<br>  gw at boost mobile, a prepaid cell phone service in the usa|`|vrnL7du0aa	Reception is hands down Boost Mobile. Cricket may work good for you if you are close to one of their towers. If not, it is a paperweight. I tried a Cricket phone, and I live in a large city. It worked great in certain parts of town, but was useless in my neighborhood.I even tried one of the antennas they sell at Radio Shack and it still didn't work. Trying it out doesn't hurt since they have a certain period of time you can try it out and bring it back for a refund. (I think it was 48 hours, but you should ask them) Boost Mobile seems to work all around since it uses everyones towers to function. Hope this helps ya!|`|mErcbR25aa	im not really sure on that but i am with boost and there reception is probably best i've ever had on a mobile

Mow lawns, set aside a few dollars every week from your allowance.  Get really good grades and maybe ask for 5 bucks for every A.  When i was 10 or 11 I took 5 bucks, went and bought a bunch of packs of gum. Took them out of the packs, and sold each piece for 25 cents in school. That 5 bucks turned in to 20 in 2 days!

We earned 265.00, plus 80.00 in shipping so if we can ship efficiently, we'll make even more.    Good luck - here's a site once you have a Wii that you can download free games.    Thanks and Have Fun!
Awy82nOfaa	There's another way:    www.ventones.com    If you do not wish to register for an account there which requires your mobile phone number, go to www.bugmenot.com and enter www.ventones.com for some Ventones accounts you can try (usually the ones with over 60% accuracy work).    Once you've got onto Ventones with an account, it will be very easy to get started. First, you will need an audio file or song in .mp3 format. You can email me if you need an .mp3 file for a specific song. Upload that song into Ventones. Once it is done loading, you will get to choose a 30 second segment from the song to be your ringtone. To make it sound more realistically like a ringtone, I would suggest choosing the one second fade at the end.    Next, once the 30 second ringtone is done uploading, you will be given the options to either download the file to your computer, enter your phone number and have it sent in a text, or generate the download URL and enter it in your phone's web browser. (I would choose the last option to enter it into your phone's browser.)    Once it is in your browser, it might get slow, just because the download files are setting up and all that stuff. It will automatically download (it's a very small file) in about a second or two. To find the file, go to your "My Music" section (name will vary based on carriers; just play with it a little) and set the song as RINGTONE.     Congratulations, your song is a ringtone =)    (Note: I'm not sure if you have to pay to download it because you're using the Internet. I don't think I had to pay)    Hope this helped!

XMN8gsXhaa	When the FIOS Tech comes to install your services your phone will be converted to the new ONT first.  Then your internet will be transferred, and your video feed will be last.  The tech will take the coax on the outside of your home from the com cast terminal and put it into your ONT.  Then the tech will check all the connections to make sure you have the best image possible.  Once your video feed is verified then you can call com cast and cancel.  I wouldn't do it before just in case there is a problem.  The tech will let you know that it is ok to cancel the com cast service.  The whole install should take between 5-7 hours.<br>  <br>  You cannot run both FIOS and com cost at the same time unless you have dual coax running in your home.  The FIOS Tech will not run new coax, but if additional is needed he/she will place it.|`|LddkW0JFaa	Comcast and Fios are two different services.

fwnqB0dTaa	That depends on if the phone is locked to a provider or not.    If it's locked then you can only use a new SIM from that provider.    If unlocked then you can use any SIM card in it you want.    Having said that    I used to use 2 phones, one for work and one for home, on different networks (Vodafone & O2 in the UK) and I could switch the SIMs between phones no problem.    Best advice I can give is try it, and if it doesn't work get the phone unlocked, no point unlocking first as it may turn out to be a waste of money.|`|BNSy3xViaa	So, you are getting a phone from the same carrier?  or, getting a a new phone from a different carrier?
