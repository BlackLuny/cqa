9e9bOgeSaa	umm..nn ho cpt la domanda =d|`|YepWsVVNaa	Dipende di quale "inclinazione" parli!|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	Per poter presentare la domanda di "disponibilit all'adozione" i prerequisiti sono quelli di essere una coppia sposata con una convivenza di alemno 3 anni (valgono ,se dimostrati anche prima del matrimonio) , la domanda di disponibilit va presentata al Tribunale dei Minori ( in alcune regioni si passa prima dagli assistenti sociali e poi al TdM).  Il TdM chiede info su di voi ai Carabinieri e Servizi Sociali , normalmente una visita veloce alla caserma dei carabinieri con un breve colloquio basta, mentre con i SS servono ,se tutto va bene, 4/5 incontri.  Credo che le tendenze sessuali in un a coppia sposata dovrebbero essere stabilite, comunque non conosco casi di coppie sposate e "diverse" che fanno richiesta di adozione.  Il percorso descritto vale sia per la disponibilit all'adozione nazionale che internazionale, la differenza  che per l'adozione internazionale occorre un decreto di disponibilit all'adozione, per cui occorre un ulteriore passaggio (colloquio) con un giudice del TdM.  Per quanto riguarda l'affido, possono chiederlo anche i single, quindi in questo caso non sono a conoscenza del fatto che verificano l'eterosessualit dell'affidatario.|`|4b8f512dac968cc22c4661f0a9f1f8ccaa	Lasciando da parte per un momento il dibattito sull`adozione da parte di coppie gay, resterei nel campo delle inclinazioni sessuali..  Io so che quando si vuol adottare un bambino bisogna fornire qualificazioni di vario tipo, con il mondo che vediamo davanti al nostro naso e i problemi attuali legati ad abusi di vario genere +pedoflilia, le inclinazioni devono essere controllate , e come............  E le qualita` morali , indipendemente da tante altre cose.  Ciao.|`|7ApeQkcIaa	?????????|`|FMNLm2ipaa	per quanto riguarda l adozione si, la coppia deve essere sposata da almeno tre anni, ed essere composta da un uomo e una donna. poi ci sono altri elementi limitativi ad es l eta della coppia e del bambino. insomma in ogni caso si le inclinazioni sessuali sono un elemento essenziale per l adozione|`|C8vEXV7daa	Mhmhmh non ho capito la domanda... puoi spiegarti meglio?Posso solo dirti ke x essere abilitati all adozione occore essere uniti in matrimonio e gli adottanti devono avere piu di 18 anni e meno di 45 anni rispetto al minore d adottare...|`|Y3FdWU7qaa	Se la coppia  eterosessuale, almeno di nome, se il matrimonio o la convivenza accertabile durano da almeno tre anni, non ci sono ostacoli per presentare la domanda per l'adozione nazionale.  Per l'adozione internazionale, invece, si deve anche superare "l'ostacolo" dell'assistente sociale e dello psicologo che, in teoria, di fronte a tendenze spiccatamente omosessuali potrebbero esprimere parere contrario.  A quel punto si potrebbe aprire un contenzioso che potrebbe portare ad una revisione della legge, ma la strada mi sembra abbastanza difficile.|`|ivkZaRwkaa	certo se sei gay non penso ti affidino un minore...ma non perch sia contri gli omosessuali ma non penso ke possano darelo stesso affetto di una coppia etero..|`|jyBoJCjvaa	spigati meglio|`|LsKzAVyfaa	non tutte trovano purtroppo accoglimento.  io ho sentito di un paio di coppie omosessuali che sono riusciti ad adottare un bambino ma (per quanto ne so io) in italia  molto difficile riuscirci.  Al contrario in america sono molto pi numerose le coppie omosessuali che adottano uno o pi bambini.

It can come anytime for a young girl going through puberty, but the usual age is between 11-16.  You will bleed anywhere between 3-8 days, and then it will stop, and happen again about 3 weeks later (that is if you have a regular cycle). Alot of girls when they first start getting their periods have irregular cycles; they may have one period and not have another for a few months! It's just your body adjusting to all the changes.  Start getting prepared now; keep some sanitary pads in your school bag, and if you feel the need, start wearing panty liners; they can help absorb discharge in the meantime, and if you did get your period, will help you hold out before you get to the bathroom.  If you have trouble with period pain - tummy cramps - a hot water bottle, some pain killers, and lying down on your side with your legs curled up, or even taking a bubble bath may help.  If you have any other questions or concerns, ask a close female, an older sister, mother, relative, friend or school nurse.|`|K0tT6JXMaa	Menstruation is bleeding.

Una mia amica ha vissuto pi o meno la stessa situazione e mi sembrava che lei esagerasse ... invece a quanto pare esistono anche assistenti cos!  Io e mio marito abbiamo avuto un'esperienza totalmente opposta: l'assistente sociale  stata meravigliosa, gentile, comprensiva, dolce, socievole e la psicologa non  stata da meno.  Con loro due il nostro cammino  stato un'esperienza ricchissima e molto gradevole.  Quando abbiamo detto loro che tutti ci avevano avvertiti con frasi del tipo: "vedrete che i colloqui vi distruggeranno moralmente e fisicamente", oppure "le assistenti e le psicologhe sono mostri vestiti da donne" ... sono rimaste a bocca aperta!  Mi spiace tantissimo che la tua esperienza sia stata cos .... dovrebbero essere proprio loro le persone pazienti e dolci che ti guidano e ti seguono in un momento molto importante e delicato come l'adozione.

Non potete richiedere i colloqui con altri operatori?  Poi, se uno fa un dato lavoro non significa per forza debba uniformarsi agli altri, penso che il desiderio di avere una famiglia e dei figli sia del tutto sano e normale....  Poi se una coppia che lavora da XYZ fa dei figli e non ha bisogno di adottarli, cosa succede?  arriva l'assistente sociale a portarglieli via?  Penso che sia meglio anche per il bambino vivere in una famiglia piuttosto che in un istituto, quindi non dovrebbe essere una persona sola, con motivazioni cos misere, a decidere una cosa cos importante.  Continuate a fare ricorsi, vi auguro di avere fortuna.    la mia non era un'accusa, anzi, mi sembrava strano che potesse essere un problema del genere.  Ma se il suo ex marito lavorava l, allora vuol dire che mischia i suoi affari privati con il lavoro, in tal caso dovresti farle rapporto e sarebbe pi che giustificato|`|B1vxivLraa	Perch non prendete un avvocato?

r2VXXH0Laa	Rispondo anche a ciondola...  Io e mio marito non possiamo avere figli, quindi abbiamo intrapreso il meraviglioso cammino dell'adozione: dopo aver completato l'iter ed essere risultati "pienamente idonei", siamo "in attesa" da due anni e a maggio 2009 la nostra domanda scade, il che vuol dire che se non ci chiamano, dovremo ricominciare TUTTO da capo, a partire dagli incontri informativi dove spiegano cosa significa adottare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Eppure noi abbiamo chiesto bimbi fino a 6 anni!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ora non mi venissero a dire che in tutte le centinaia di case famiglia non ci sono minori da 0 a 6 anni perch  una bugia enorme. La verit , come dicono anche gli assistenti sociali, che stato e istituti guadagnano anche su questo ..... pi il minore resta in casa famiglia, pi sovvenzioni vengono elargite .................................. e noi stiamo qui ad "aspettare" ....  Tutto questo per dire semplicemente che sarebbe davvero giusto, meraviglioso, coscenzioso, rispettoso ..... migliorare anche il sistema delle adozioni, ma per farlo bisognerebbe migliorare le istituzioni !!!|`|Fi9j2OcMaa	Son capitato per caso sulla tua domanda e mi ha colpito per l'importanza dell'argomento che hai sollevato.  Oggi purtroppo nel nostro paese vi sono troppe cose veramente grosse socialmente parlando che non sono prese in nessuna considerazione da chi avrebbe la possibilit di risolverne o sminuirne i problemi ad esse connesse ed una di queste cose  proprio la difficolt nelle adozioni che sono quasi bloccate anche a causa degli interessi economici che ci girano intorno.  Naturalmente  giusto che vi siano degli accurati controlli prima di affidare dei piccoli a gente che magari non ha le caratteristiche richieste ma per esperienza personale posso assicurare che vi sono troppi cavilli che bloccano eccessivamente il meccanismo delle adozioni ed in certi casi lo rendono addirittura impossibile.  E' per problemi come questo che bisognerebbe creare dei movimenti d'opinione provenienti dal basso perch sono convinto che sono le voci unite della gente che si f sentire, che agisce, che protesta per far muovere poi le cose a livello di chi  pu cambiare le regole.  Brava, complimenti per aver toccato un argomento cos importante e delicato ma poco conosciuto dai pi.|`|FmWLgLGpaa	io ho vissuto non personalmente due esperienze di adozione:  la prima con mie cugine che sono state adottate perch tolte alla madre con un ritardo mentale e quindi non in grado di prendersi cura di loro. sono state adottate e alle famiglie di adozione non sono  stati fatti i dovuti controlli e si sono ritrovate in famiglie pessime, le hanno rovinate...  l'altra adozione da parte di due miei amici molto giovani che, certo dopo una lunga trafila e molti controlli, hanno avuto in adozione una bambina di 1 mese...  bisogna avere pazienza e, per il bene dei bambini, accettare i controlli per evitare che poi si ritrovino in famiglie che non sanno dare ci di cui hanno bisogno...  so che sicuramente tutti noi ci sentiamo degni di poter adottare dei bambini ma, dovendo essere una trafila uguale per tutti,  meglio che qs controlli ci siano...  ammetto per che se l'adozione e l'affidamento fossero pubblicizzati maggiormente e sveltite le pratiche le persone si avvicinerebbero molto di pi a queste pratiche...|`|3ca13ee049b82d8ba9bb0f2a60842df7aa	Separerei il problema aborto e il problema adozioni.  L'aborto e' una scelta di disperazione, di ultima spiaggia e negli ultimi anni purtroppo di convenienza.  La legge sull'aborto doveva servire a eliminare dalla faccia della terra i macellai che si arricchivano con questa pratica.  A mio modesto parere a questa legge, che ritengo equilibrata, soprattutto per il periodo in cui era stata approvata, dovevano essere affiancate strutture funzionanti nel senso efficaci e non nascoste nell'angolo dell'ospedale o in consultori fatiscenti, dove si davano gli strumenti ai giovani per evitare di ricorrere all'aborto.    Per quanto riguarda l'adozione, sono concorde con te, i controlli sono addirittura talmente eccessivi che diventano ridicoli nella loro rigidita'.  Se , per ipotesi, si dovessero applicare a chi sta per avere un figlio, ci sarebbero pochissime nascite.  Pero' un minimo di verifica della famiglia adottiva ci deve essere, magari diminuiamo la parte burocratica e verifichiamo piu la solidita' umana della coppia.  Per assurdo, credo che visto il tipo di lavoro che faccio, la mia lontananza da casa, se chiedessi l'adozione di mia figlia, questa mi sarebbe negata. E mia figlia invece sta crescendo normalmente felice e normalmente infelice, come tanti bambini che la circondano.    Sai ho un ricordo da ragazzo, un solo stipendio che entrava in casa, tre figli e l'arrivare anzi il non arrivare a fine mese con i soldi. Mia madre che rimane ancora gravida, e l'aborto clandestino....  Ho vissuto con partecipazione il referendum sull'aborto, ma da allora le condizioni sono cambiate, oggi potremmo fare notevolmente di piu per diminuire questa sofferenza. Ma non cambiando la legge, ma cambiando il dintorno.    ok lascio spazio agli altri|`|mmO3Pmumaa	non avrei potuto dire di meglio. sono pienamente daccordo con te.|`|jwZ6T4KAaa	ci sono molte coppie sterili che farebbero di tutto per adottare un figlio anche con handicap: anzich abortire, perch non concedere loro questa possibilit?|`|VIFLUdDTaa	sono d'accordo con te,troppe clausole e troppi protezionismi,  facile che i bimbi vengano tenuti in istituti per lucrarci sopra. L'aborto cmq una tragedia:|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	Ciao,  credo che la risposta alla tua domanda sia.....perch l'adozione frega a pocchissime persone dal punto di vista di un ritorno di immagine politica, mentre sfruttare i 2000 anni di condanna dell'aborto da parte della chiesa politicamente rende moltissimo. Noto con disgusto che Ferrara e la Chiesa cattolica chiamano l'aborto omicidio, mentre non alzano un dito verso le Nazioni che praticano costantemente l'omicidio con la pena di morte.  Secondo la mia opinione semplificare l'adozione nazionale non significa ridurre i controlli alle coppie, ma creare un database Nazionale con tutti i bambini adottabili , al momento ogni Tribunale dei Minori  un piccolo feudo a s, e cura il proprio orticello, per una coppia fare domanda di adozione coprendo l'intero territorio Italiano significa spedire la disponibilit all'adozione a 23 tribunali dei Minore,|`|s8lFr5lSaa	Ah ma perch ferrara  un politico? Pensavo fosse il pagliaccio di Montecitorio & co.....|`|KVrmFvNeaa	bravooooo!!!  verissimo, sono d accordo con te|`|FMNLm2ipaa	aura la risposta e'semplice: ci sono troppe coppie che vogliono adottare e pochi bambini "disponibili". prima di tutto perche le coppie ( o almeno la maggir parte) chiede bimbi il piu piccoli possibile quindi della fascia di eta'0-3 anni. e se da una parte e'meglio ovviamnte dall altra l'iter burocratico e'incasinato. perche difficilmente il bimbo non ha parenti (come succedeva ad es durante la guerra). ora difficile e'il constatare l adottabilita del bimbo nei confronti dei gentiori o di altri parenti. poi che la legge debba essere rivista sono daccordissimo con te.    x oltreilmare: aspetta e'verissimo che ci sono molti troppi bambini all interno della casafamiglia ma questo non vuol dire che siano stati dichiartati adottabili. e'tutto li il centro del problema. se fosse piu sbrigativo l iter per dichiarare adottabile o meno un bimbo non ci sarebbero cosi tante lunghe attese. anche se cmq i bibmi adottabili sono in numero inferiore alle famiglie adottanti.non dobbiamo dimenticarcelo e non scordiamoci anche il fatto che la legge (e ripeto la legge!) tutela giustamente prima di tutto l interesse del minonre che gia di per se'poverino ha subito un trauma. quindi prima viene l interesse del minore e poi quello della famiglia. se entrambe coincidono allora si da' il via libera all adozione.so il calvario che state passando. pero non dimenticate il fine ultimo del vostro gesto
4jNmEIQeaa	Ciao da Valeria di Ferrara: io ho contattato, dopo controllo accurato, alcune associazioni da cui ho potuto avere "in adozione a distanza" delle bellissime bambine.  Una  l'Ecpat Italia, a Milano, si occupano anche di combattere il turismo sessuale infantile.  L'altra  Sos Tibet/India/Nepal, fondato da una ragazza/signora di Assisi con un Lama, ogni estate si recano nei villaggi fondati in questi Paesi e li aiutano con medici, insegnanti, etc.  La terza  Amurt a Parma. Sono anche loro in gamba.   L'ultima si chiama Sos Villaggi e curano molto case famiglia per i bambini e le mamme.  Ogni bambino "adottato", in ognuna di queste associazioni, ha almeno 10 "genitori", in modo da garantire, in qualsiasi momento, la continuit del sostegno sia per il bambino, che per la sua comunit e il progetto in cui sono inseriti. In questo modo, anche se un sostenitore non pu pi continuare, c' meno urgenza di sostituirlo.  Io adesso ho in "adozione" due sorelline Thailandesi, una terza bimba thailandese di 4 anni, e una bimba Nepalese.  Sono tutte adorabili!  Tanti auguri a tutti, io comincio fra qualche giorno anche il percorso per un'adozione definitiva, anche se ho gi due maschietti.  Ma non c' due senza tre...  E si possono anche aiutare, per un mese, durante il periodo estivo, i bambini di Chernobyl colpiti da radiazioni.  Da noi a Ferrara, ma con sede a Terni, abbiamo "Aiutiamoli a vivere".  Un mese lontano dalle radiazioni fa molto per questi bambini che sono tanto affettuosi e desiderosi di affetto.  Ciao da Valeria|`|D2OThhbCaa	Noi abbiamo adottato un bambino con actionaid, un'associazione molto seria,i soldi arrivano e molto spesso inviano notizie dettagliate dal luogo e come vengono utilizzati i vostri soldi,e due o tre volte all'anno ricevete anche un messaggio del bambino...|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	tu non vuoi adottare un bambino a distanza, vuoi fare un sostegno a distanza...non esistono le adozioni a distanza     in ogni caso ci sono centinaia di associazioni che prativano il sostegno a distanza...non ho elementi per dire se in modo serio oppure no.  Personalmente sostengo a distanza un bimbo in Kenia, ma l'associazione a cui mi appoggio non mi soddisfa, in quanto mi fornisce rarissime informazioni , ma tant'.  personalmente dovessi ripeterla nuovamente opterei per l'AVSI una gran bella organizzazione.

VClxXNs3aa	wow,, no I had to have pitocin and maybe thats why my contractions hurt so bad.  I thought I could tough it out,, but once I got to about 5 CM I couldnt, and asked for pain killer but not epidural,, they gave me stadol and it did NOTHING at ALL for the contractions!!!!! I just felt high....  :(  so 30 minutes later I asked for the epidural, they took 30 minutes to get the anesthesiologist and I thought I was going to die!!!!!    good luck with your next!  I have heard that pitocin causes contractions to be more painful. (I had to have it because waters broke and no labor.... then of course had to have the epidural which I didnt want,,, then had to get an episiotomy as the cord was tight around her neck, too!!!.... so basically nothing went the way I wanted it to, except for the baby of course!)|`|430e91db100ad72479d62a786f902924aa	No....mine were pretty flippin painful.  U must be lucky.|`|4cd558276cdaa1b1dccfb2ea080a99a5aa	With my son I didn't feel any real pain either except for pressure but I also had an epidural and then had to have a c section when I was 9 3/4 dilated due to the cord being wrapped around his body. I am due any day with my second and I am terrified of the pain again lol|`|8GCuaS2qaa	you were very lucky with no pain so keep it up whatever your doing congrats and take care|`|e3xxes6zaa	When i was having my first at home, i realy got taken by surprise, because all my contractions had been no harder than any menstrual cramps i'd ever had, and then all of a sudden, Baby is moving down the canal.    Haha!  Pushing wasn't bad at all - I guess i was just soooo surprised.  I had to tell my sweet one "Oh my god, i'm having the baby!"  and he was like, "...I know..." and i had to say "No.  No!  Right NOW!"  Maybe i'm just lucky.|`|1e671b0731e329f9cce89d55a1be07beaa	sounds nice to me!! haha but i opted to not get the epi. I loved it b/c I could feel everything. the pain was all worth it. I know I sound crazy but i actually loved being in labor! haha|`|oAkhoCQ6aa	with my first child I had such bad contraction I went delirious and almost broke my hubby's hand, they had to pull him away from me... BUT I was given pitocin (inducer) and it gave me contractions one on top of the other. I also had back labor which is REALLY painful. My hubby got me the epidural b/c I was so crazed I coulden't give any consent. It helped me a lot. NOW with my second child NO PROBLEM! So easy! Each child labor is different.      The advice I would give is don"t make a decision now, just see how its goes and how you feel at the time. One thing you can do is if you do get an epidural you can always ask them to taper if off towards the end so you can feel enough to push ( my dr. did that with my son) And if by any chance you r given pitocin get an epidural!!! Good luck! hope its as easy as the first one..  -daddyskaggs's wife|`|A9eePYntaa	wow how lucky are you!! I had my daughter 3 months ago, my second child, and with both my labours my contractions started at night, they where unbearable and had no breaks. I felt as though I would die,I had no gas no epidural nothing! but both labours were over in an hour from first contraction to placenta being delivered, i had no stitches. I guess i was pretty lucky in that sense.

I would take a hpt to see... then contact your ob, bc if you are preggo you need to get prenantal vitamins and the proper care..|`|94106f122aa0859301482207e00eda9caa	Possible - take a test|`|ab6cc85121b30e1f977b69d7896ee60daa	no its just ur cycle|`|FKn7rYB6aa	It is possibal have a test or go doctors.

F12ekJ7Saa	if your hubby was born female and had a sex change. but this is a real stupid question, and when i read the article, that was even more ridiculious!|`|1YHih8wyaa	hmmm......NO!|`|cnMXJMFUaa	If your referring to the asian male..hes been pregnant now for about 5 yrs now if not longer...its IMPOSSIBLE for a male to carry a baby at all!|`|7b9950c99c6ea90a89b5e6b29c014f81aa	Not unless your husband was born a female just like this particular case and you turn out to be a men.|`|430e91db100ad72479d62a786f902924aa	No ur husband isn't pregnant.|`|3bfvg3YRaa	in the article the first line very clearly says he used to be a women which means he still had female sex organs in him.....so unless your husband use to be a women  no hes not pregnant... its common sense...|`|9y8Gd55haa	HELL NO!!!|`|7UFK46daaa	LoL Does he have a uterus?|`|AM48RJmYaa	Yeah I read about that. No your husband can't get pregnant, the only reason the guy in the news got pregnant is because he used to be a girl, he got a sex change, he got his breasts removed but left his sex organs. Him and his girlfriend decided to have a baby so they went to many fertility clinics looking to be referred to a sperm bank, and he got pregnant.|`|GLetSiztaa	No WAyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy|`|FvgKNPPbaa	Are you serious, you have to be joking?  The man that was on the TV that was pregnant that you are talking about was a trans-gender female. Meaning he was once a female so he still has all the female reproductive system.  Unless your husband is a trans-gender then NO he cannot be pregnant.|`|66633d9122b3aa8042ed5b75071a98d0aa	Well technically that isn't a man. Its a lady. He was born a lady! Duh! So unless your hubby was born a women there's no way he can be pregnant. Poor kid is going to be made fun of the rest of his life!|`|AASlbN6Caa	not unless he is a sea horse|`|769387baa4426a39e6bddf8d26396690aa	If he is girl YE HAW you are going to be RICH!!!     Around the age of 30 men go through a stage where their metabolism changes, if he drinks a fair amount of beer (or has in the past, month or so) ice cream, LOVES salad dressing, mayo, bacon, etc. he really could gain a bunch of weight.    I know it sounds odd but even if you are a good cook, and he just eats more than his 2000 cal minimum he could gain a lot. If he changes his exercise routine that could be a factor too.     I really doubt if he is, but if so you could always do a pregnancy test..... the hormone for that would be the same for men as women,,,, but it is HIGHLY unlikely that he is pregnant....     Take it as a compliment,,, you just cook to good girl!!!!|`|QjBUNbl1aa	No. Because the man is not really a man. He was actually born as a woman and his taking male hormones.|`|aFKjIPLaaa	Are you serious?|`|ZJ8n5Lkwaa	LOL!  Men are great at getting fat quickly.  If he has the normal man parts, then no, he can't be pregnant.  Only men 33 or younger can get pregnant.|`|PzR0cUFOaa	damn girl......the ONLY way a man can get pregnant is for him to take lots of hormone injections and have an invitro fertilization to place a fertilized egg into his stomach....you arent serious with that question are you?!?!?!|`|vI77sjj0aa	NOOOO. did you not learn biology in school?    that article is about a woman that got pregnant and had half of a sex change, so she looks like a man but is technically still a woman.|`|dnf1UWQ5aa	That man isn't really a man. You might want to read the full story before thinking that. Your husband is just getting fat.|`|f9IVXwBlaa	LoL you can't be serious|`|ivzbPemnaa	that guy you read about is actually a girl that took hormones and steroids to become manly. she never had a sex change but her sexual identity is apparently male. a male with a penis and no vagina or uterus cannot possibly get pregnant. and if you're serious about him being pregnant how in the world would that have happened? do you have sperm that went into him somehow? i don't think so. so no it is not possible.|`|mI87g94Faa	YIKES NO WAY. Possibly a beer belly ?|`|ME82PPoOaa	No chance.|`|ZssdjW2haa	lol no hes justeating to much.|`|vZCGlnkbaa	Angelina::    Ha, that is a great one, WOW!!!    I would have to say no, your hubby is just getting fat, like you if you are pregnant, for they to gain (sympathy) weight!!     If he is gaining way to much weight in a week, then he should seek out a doctor, for he could have a hernia, that will cause your intestines into your abdomen.. Not a good Thing!!     So have him think about going and soon!!!|`|rBLwf3Ebaa	ha ha my sister in law's husband's belly has been taking the same route as hers... it keeps growing bigger as she keeps getting more pregnant!  We joke around and claim this to be "sympathy"pains or rather "gains"... hee hee....     there was a movie with arnold and he had a baby but that is just the movies...|`|PxPUApw5aa	there is this thing in China were they are trying to do an expirement were they can get a male pregnant, i highly doubt its going to work, or anything....   tell your husband to work out
b1Yh8m9aaa	Il Percorso che una famiglia deve intraprendere per l'Adozione di un bambino o bambina  un percorso di fatto scandito da tappe e traguardi ben definiti.  La riflessione che mi viene  che spesso si tratta di traguardi che possono variare la loro posizione nel "tempo e nello spazio".   Un pochino come se una  maratona fosse improvvisamente posticipata di qualche mese senza preavviso o se, una volta partita la corsa, i giudici di gara decidessero di allungarla di altri 10 km.   Insomma, difficilmente chi si avventura in questa esperienza ne esce rilassato . E questa  gi una constatazione che dovrebbe far riflettere i tanti Operatori del Settore: dai Giudici dei Tribunali per i Minorenni (siano essi Togati o Onorari), ai Responsabili della Commissione Adozioni Internazionali, ai membri tutti della Commissione Parlamentare per l'Infanzia . Provo qui a raccontarvi quale , nella norma, ed a volte anche il "dietro le quinte" , di questa "originale maratona", che si corre in due , almeno all'inizio, che coinvolge in alcuni tratti i parenti prossimi (figli se ci sono , genitori, zii, fratelli). Una maratona che a volte si corre in pochi mesi, ed altre in alcuni anni di instancabile e paziente attesa. Una maratona che a volte non costa nulla, ma spesso, purtroppo, costringe ad " impegnarsi" anche il quinto dello stipendio.  Una Maratona che vi far incontrare gente meravigliosa ed anche farabutti che faranno leva sui vostri pi intimi desideri: appunto quelli di una coppia che desidera un bambino.     ti consiglio vivamente una adozione (o piu') a distanza|`|GsVgRXymaa	http://www.previewonline.info/index.php?... eccoti un link utile che ti spiega tutto...ciao|`|929hKk6maa	nn so cm si fa...ma t dico ke farai una cs meravigliosa..anke io ho questo desiderio...xr m vorrei prendere quelli dell'estero e appena nati...xk quelli italiani sn difficili da prendere in adozione...|`|IiOkuBhOaa	vai in centri apposta..o in comunit e fai la rikiesta|`|PIqUAsAnaa	beh e una bellissima cosa,devi informarti nei comuni e centri per l'addozione se avrai tutte le carte in regola avrai il tuo bimbo/A ciao|`|kK6AjzW0aa	ke bella cosa ;) kmq devi andare nei centri apposta :)|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	incomincia a divetare grande , a sposarti, e dopo tre anni di matrimonio  o almeno di convivenza dovresti presentare al TdM la tua disponibilit all'adozione......una volta passato al setaccio dei Servizi Sociali e ottenuta l'idoneit per l'AI devi cercarti un Ente autorizzato e aspettare il tuo turno, per l'AN semplicemente il TdM se ti considera una coppia "appetibile" ti convoca nel caso in cui ci sono in quel TdM uno o pi bambini dichiarati abbandonati.|`|s8lFr5lSaa	Devi sposarti intanto.. e poi far richiesta!    Intanto potresti prenderne uno a distanza.. con meno di 30 euro al mese...    Vai sul sito della action aid!|`|ttLO3zD8aa	quando diventerai mamma puffo potremo svelarti il segreto.. fino ad allora non si pu...altrimenti se lo impara Gargamella.. :)
Ima4qCgxaa	Non sono ironica ma se provassi con "Chi l'ha visto?"?  Ogni tanto ci sono casi di figli che cercano i genitori... certo, significa esporsi ma nel tuo caso quali alternative hai?  Potresti lanciare un appello su internet ma anche l dovresti almeno allegare una foto e dare i tuoi dati, quando sei nata e dove ecc.  Perch se ti ha lasciata all'ospedale magari non ti ha riconosciuta e sono guai...in ogni modo, come prima cosa andrei in ospedale a chiedere, oppure all'anagrafe...sei maggiorenne, hai diritto per legge ad avere informazioni sulla tua madre biologica, se esitono dei dati.    Su Wikipedia ho trovato questo:    Una volta compiuti i 25 anni l'adottato pu accedere alle notizie riguardanti i genitori biologici presentando istanza al Tribunale dei minorenni. Pu farlo anche raggiunta la maggiore et se sussistono gravi motivi. L'accesso alle notizie  autorizzato con decreto.  Nel caso che la madre biologica abbia dichiarato alla nascita di non voler essere nominata, l'adottato non pu avere accesso alle informazioni|`|s8lFr5lSaa	Guarda... so che non  molto ma puoi scrivere un articolo sul mio blog... chiama chi l'ha visto.. ti aiutano!    Cmq se vuoi chiamami che ti faccio conoscere un po' di gente che ti pu aiutare!|`|r2VXXH0Laa	Puoi rivolgerti al Tribunale dei Minori della tua citt di nascita: dovrai presentare un'istanza apposita, per non sempre puoi ottenere le informazioni che cerchi semplicemente perch i genitori biologici hanno il diritto, nel momento in cui decidono di dare in adozione un minore, di non voler essere pi rintracciati, per nessuno motivo.  La legge lo consente e in questo caso qualunque informazioni o carta che li riguardi, viene distrutta.  Puoi anche chiedere ai servizi sociali sempre della citt di nascita: loro ti sapranno dare indicazioni precise.  Ho completato l'iter per l'adozione di un minore, quindi quello che ho scritto non  frutto di fantasia, ma la procedura che riporta il tribunale.  Buona fortuna .... con tutto il cuore.    Possibile che ci si diverta a mettere i pollici in gi o a rispondere con cretinate anche su argomenti cos delicati?  Il vostro cervellino  davvero piccolo e limitato! ... e ora spolliciate pure, se vi divertite cos!|`|9uS7sr9maa	Dovresti provare a chiedere nell'ospedale in cui ti ha lasciata. Ma l'impresa mi sembra difficile, perch solitamente si lascia un bambino in ospedale in forma anonima. Ti auguro comunque buona fortuna.|`|QFWbOnJ3aa	ke belle parole...xke nn ti fai dire in quale ospedale ti avevano lasciato dai tuoi genitori adottivi?L'ospedale avr sicuramente qlc dato da darti!!baci e in bocca al lupo!|`|ceLeL5P1aa	prova ad andare all'anagrafe  all'ospedale dove sei nata e vedi se riesci a trovare qc!  Cmq in bocca al lupo e spero che riuscirai nella tua impresa  prova di grand coraggio|`|kK6AjzW0aa	"c' posta per te" .... ??? in molti vanno la x questi motivi...|`|929hKk6maa	ciao  bruttiximo nn conoscere la mamma ke t ha messo al mondo...nn saprei cm fare...a me viene da piangere quando vedo c' posta x te e vedo delle scene d questo genere...nn saprei cs dirti...ma t spero soltanto ke il tuo desiderio si avveri..buona fortuna|`|KVrmFvNeaa	dovresti informarti in quell'ospedale. se gli spieghi ti diranno dove rintracciarla, sempre che abbia lasciato un recapito.|`|GhboWfS3aa	ti auguro di cuore di trovarla e di scoprire che  una brava donna e che ti ha pensato sempre.ma se non fosse cos ricordati che un padre e una madre ce li hai|`|5f88UJUPaa	sai penso davvero che rivolgersi a qualche trasmissione televisiva in questo caso possa essere utile. in bocca al lupo!!  p.s. sono strasicura che tua madre non smette neanche adesso di pensarti in ogni momento|`|50Y0Oc7laa	io nn sono esperta di queste cose... l'unica alternativa che conosco  c' posta per te... anche perch per questa storia della privacy nn credo che in ospedale tu riesca a risalire a lei|`|U0nqNqfXaa	Io non so come potresti fare per rintracciarla. Ti posso solo dire che sicuramente non ha smesso mai..MAI di pensarti perch comunque ti ha partorito. Sicuramente anche lei ti sta cercando ma non sa come fare oppure come tutti i genitori si pente di quel che ha fatto e non ha il coraggio di cercarti. Magari pensa che tu la odi...o che comunque non ha il diritto di cercarti... Anche se non ti conosco ti ammiro perch non sei come le altre...tu...anche se non la conosci LA AMI e questo ti fa onore...Buona fortuna!|`|LtdlPbMvaa	Io ti posso consigkliare 2 programmi c' posta x te e chi l'ha visto!  che x ti fanno pagare tanti soldini se vieni ai miei programmi tipo (c' posta x me oppure io l'ho visto) nn ti faccio spendere nnt e hai la probbabilit di trovare tua madre allo 1%   skerzo cerco solo di tenerti un po su e sdrammatizzare il momento x dirti di nn mollare e ke tua madre avr avuto le sue ragioni e che vuole vedierti presto!!|`|mRN2NJDHaa	brava....sei davvero una persona speciale per parlare cosi....ho un amica adottata che ce l'ha con sua madre....e perch? perch gli voleva troppo bene e l'ha dovuta lasciare a una famiglia piu fortunata di lei.....e non pensa mai a quello che possa aver provato sua madre....certo che ti avrebbe voluto ne sono sicura anche io,e devi essere fiera di aver avuto una madre che ti voleva cosi bene da lasciarti pur di farti avere una vita migliore.....secondo me non ti imporresti nella sua vita se la trovassi....ci dovresti almeno parlare e capire il perch  successo......lo spero per te|`|mOLQJVckaa	vai nell'ospedale in cui sei nata e chiedi informazioni.... poi cerca di dialogare con la persona che ha il tuo stesso  DNA  e vedi se puo essere lei la tua madre naturale    buona fortuna!!!|`|vGgP6LOKaa	Se sei stata adottata i tuoi genitori dovrebbero avere tutti gli incartamenti relativi alla tua pratica. Secondo me dovresti rivolgerti al tribunale che ti ha dato in adozione. Penso che solo loro siano in grado di risolvere il tuo problema.   Anche mia cugina ha adottato una bambina cinque anni fa. Sia tu che lei avete avuto un bacio doppio dalla vita: il primo dalla vostra mamma naturale, altrimenti non sareste state qui a riempirci ogni giorno di  gioia, ed il secondo dai vostri genitori adottivi che si sono presi il pesante compito volervi bene senza condizioni.  In bocca al lupo per tutto!|`|qvzrZp8iaa	beh, la strada pi semplice sarebbe|`|LhdhSdshaa	se non vuoi andare a c' posta per te c' anche il treno dei desideri!  ma per favore, se si deve dare un consiglio serio penso che dovresti andare all'ospedale e sentre in amministrazione se ci sono possibilit di avere delle documentazioni della tua nascit.  la legge attuale credo che preveda la totale anonimit di chi partorisce, ma forse ai tempi della tua nascit non era previsto.|`|kM5PZultaa	ankio sn adottato...ma al kontrario di te nn li vorr konoscere mai i miei veri genitori...sarebbe come negare i miei di adesso...in effetti quelli veri ke mi han cresciuto educato dato delle possibilit per un buon futuro e fatto passare dei bei momenti.....conoscere i miei genitori biologici sarebbe un p come rinnegare tt...mi sentirei estraneo da lor che kavolo....|`|Qsmf1Vezaa	ti dir...io lascerei perdere trasmissioni televisive o altro..Direi di tentare la strada dell'ospedale dove sei nata...Se proprio sei decisa a farlo...  Io ho avuto la fortuna di avere dei genitori naturali, ma se mi fosse capitato di essere stata adottata, credo che non avrei cercato i genitori naturali...Avrei dato tutto l'affetto a chi mi ha cresciuta!!!!  Perch il genitori sono quelli che ti crescono,,,non quelli che ti mettono al mondo. Sicuramente la tua mamma non voleva lasciarti, ma per qualche motivo  stata costretta a farlo...  Ti consiglio di continuare a volerLe bene a distanza...se ti riesce....  Rischi magari brutte sorprese....  non vorrei sembrarti negativa, ma se nella vita alcune cose vanno cos,  perch deve essere cos..Io sono del parere che nulla capita a caso!!!!   Ti faccio tanti auguri per qualsiasi cosa deciderai di fare...  Baci|`|eEkypUawaa	Ciao, io sono nata a Vercelli ma non sono la tua mamma, mi dispiace. Il suo nome, sicuramente non te lo daranno mai, per via della privacy, ma cerca di avere pi notizie possibili, per esempio ora della nascita, medico che ha assistito al parto, infermiere ecct, dopo devi armarti grande pazienza e rintracciare queste persone, lo so  un lavoro lungo, che richiede tempo e pazienza. Ma non ti arrendere. Sai, ora ti racconto uina storia. Una mia zia, da un amore giovanile, ha avuto una figlia, lui sparito, questa figlia lei l'ha amata, l'ha allattata e dopo una settimana le  stata strappata dalle braccia per consegnarla alla ruota. Le sue condizioni successive non le hanno mai consentito di cercare quella figlia ma l'ha sempre portata nel cuore!|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	Se non sbaglio i figli adottivi dopo il 25esimo anno di et possono avere accesso alle informazioni conosciute e ai vari dossier sul loro passato , credo che in questo tuo desiderio possano aiutarti i giudici del Tribunale dei Minori e le ASL.    Per favore l'adozione  una cosa seria non mischiamola con "Ce posta per t", abbiate un minimo di buon senso|`|cQzuy4uyaa	Ciaoo, posso capire il tuo desiderio  di conoscerla, e penso che sia anche giusto cos.  Prova a parlarne con i tuoi genitori, oppure torna all' ospedale dove ti ha lasciata e cerca notizie, fammi sapere!    Tanti auguri e un bacio  ^. ^

Bj?oooooooooooo      Tita|`|mWzI61Itaa	Bem Leticia vamos por partes.  Antes de mais nada: n?o  indicado vc tomar a plula do dia seguinte mais de uma vez no mesmo ms. A plula do dia seguinte tem efeitos colaterais fortssimos. Um deles  esse enj?o que vc esta sentindo.    Segunda coisa: nunca, jamais, em hiptese alguma tome um anticoncepcional que uma amiga, tia, etc indicou. SEMPRE consulte um ginecologista antes. N?o precisa ir com sua m?e, v com uma amiga ou algo do tipo. E depois, ir ao ginecologista n?o  sinal de que vc transou. Toda mulher deve consultar o ginecologista aps a primeira menstrua??o. E fique sossegada, pois eles tem uma coisa chamada TICA que n?o permite que ele conte a sua m?e que vc n?o  mais virgem. Alis, caso ele conte isso d at processo.  Cuide da sua sade em primeiro lugar. Pense que, ja esta feito. Sua m?e nao pode te bater, matar, esganar por vc ter tido rela??es sexuais. O mximo que vai acontecer  vc ouvir um serm?o dela, porm isso passa. N?o d pra consertar e fazer voc virgem novamente. Como diria uma amiga: vc  mulher pra fazer sexo n?o ? Ent?o seja mulher e conte para a sua m?e que fez!  V a um ginecologista e comece a tomar o anticoncepcional urgente! Vc vai acabar com seu corpo tomando pilula do dia seguinte toda hora. Correndo o risco at de futuramente n?o poder ter mais filhos.    Boa sorte linda!|`|Wt29oN7Xaa	Olha Letcia, voc tem que ir ao mdico pedir uma plula, pois existem "N" tipos e  necessrio que ele avalie a melhor para voc.

2OFxUioOaa	oi Juanitah, primeiramente parabns.  O Beta HCG  um exame muito confivel. Acho q depois q vc fez o Beta, vc deveria ter feito uma transvaginal ao invs de uma ecografia, porq a transvaginal  q mostra, no come?o da gravidez, o tempo e a situa??o do embri?o.  Ainda ta cedo, at a 4...5 semana s d pra ver o saco gestacional e a vesicula vitelina.  Qdo eu descobri q tava grvida, fiz logo a transvaginal e no exame deu 6 semanas, mas eu tinha certeza q era menos, nesse exame so deu pra ver a vesicula e o saco gestacional, meu mdico at me assustou c a possibilidade de ser um ovo anembrionado e me receitou fazer uma outra transvaginal depois de 2 semanas, deste vez q fiz, conclui q o tempo na primeira trans tava realmente errado e na verdade no dia q fiz a segunda trans  q estava c 6 semanas (nesta inclusive deu pra ouvir o cora??o e ver o embri?o), entao, meu conselho  q vc fa?a uma TRANSVAGINAL daqui uma ou duas semanas. Mas fique tranquila viu, o Beta, q eh sua maior dvida,  um exame bastante confivel, deve ter acontecido c vc o mesmo q aconteceu comigo...    beijos e muito boa sorte na sua gesta??o!!|`|AA11808736	Juanitah querida, fique tranquila....

alN517awaa	Ola, Amiga!  Tete seguir estas dicas que mais cedo ou mais tarde te ai, seu bebe.  As rela??es devem ser feitas durante o perodo frtil e um dia sim e outro n?o. O perodo frtil da maioria das mulheres  entre o 11o e 14o dia do ciclo menstrual, lembrando que o primeiro dia da menstrua??o  contado como dia 1. Saiba qual ser seu perodo frtil utilizando nossa calculadora de ovula??o.    Deve-se evitar o uso de cremes vaginais durante o perodo frtil, pois isso dificulta a locomo??o dos espermatozides.    Se a mulher deixar seu marido muito excitado antes da rela??o, far com que ele ejacule com maior intensidade, aumentando assim, o volume de esperma.    A mulher deve procurar n?o fazer limpeza vaginal e nem urinar logo aps o ato sexual, pois isso diminui a quantidade de espermatozides em sua vagina.    Aps o ato sexual, a mulher deve ficar com as pernas elevadas por no mnimo meia hora. Isso far com que os espermatozides encontrem com maior facilidade o colo do tero, e consequentemente evita a perda de esperma pela vagina.    Coma melhor para poder engravidar. Cerca de 12% dos casos de infertilidade s?o resultado de mulheres que pesam muito ou pouco. Coma mais frutas frescas e hortali?as, que lhe dar?o, com menos calorias, os nutrientes que seu corpo necessita para engravidar. Elimine o lcool, que pode ter efeitos nocivos  concep??o e ao feto.

Tem a maior habilidade para envolver as pessoas que podem ajud-la a tocar seus planos e n?o se importa nem um pouco em fazer um "teatrinho" quando necessrio. Sua sensualidade n?o passa despercebida, e voc aprendeu a usar essa arma muito bem. Principalmente entre quatro paredes. O perigo  se tornar muito dominador (a).    Nome: Raica  Primeira Letra: R    Significado: Quando se trata de resolver os problemas dos outros, voc pensa e age como se fosse a pessoa mais sbia do mundo. Quando o problema  seu, fica totalmente confuso (a). Isso acontece porque gostaria de decidir as coisas sempre com a cabe?a fria.

Mas quando fiz meu teste de gravidez (o da farmcia), tambm apareceu uma rosa escura (a que j  normal), e uma mais clarinha.....     Testes de gravidez detectam a presen?a do horm?nio hCG (gonadotrofina cori?nica humana) em uma amostra de urina. Altos nveis de hCG s?o produzidos durante a gravidez. Os testes de farmcia tm resultados semelhantes aos testes de urina feitos em consultrios se as instru??es forem exatamente seguidas. Quando uma mulher fica grvida, o ovo geralmente  fertilizado por um espermatozide dentro da trompa de falpio (concep??o). Com aproximadamente 9 dias da fertiliza??o, o ovo desde da trompa para o tero e se implanta na parede deste. Quando o vulo fertilizado se implanta, a placenta come?a a se desenvolver e come?a a lan?ar o hCG na corrente sangnea da m?e.    Um pouco deste hCG tambm chega  urina. Nas primeiras semanas da gesta??o, o nvel de hCG cresce muito rapidamente: dobra a cada 2 ou 3 semanas.     Justamente por isso a faixinha rosa ainda est clara,  que ainda n?o h um alto nvel de concentra??o...

AA11808736	Esta linha  chamada de linha alba. Ela aparece porque a distens?o abdominal da gravidez torna aparentes as fibras de tecido conjuntivo que separam os msculos da parede abdominal dos dois lados. Mas esta explica??o  polmica, porque certas doen?as que causam aumento do volume abdominal, como a cirrose, ou tumores, n?o provocam o aparecimento dessa linha. Por isso  possvel que fatores hormonais tenham algum papel no surgimento dessa linha nas gestantes.|`|8056492e74ad4235b2d4c4a088740f24aa	chama linha nigra e  normal, n?o significa nada.|`|QS2wGeZbaa	Essa linha  normal...chamada de linha alba....aparece no meses finais de gesta??o...todos ns temos essa linha, mas na gravidez ela escurece....Boa hora pra vc...

No entanto, algumas gestantes podem apresentar sangramentos durante a gravidez, principalmente no primeiro trimestre, sendo erroneamente chamados de menstrua??o. Geralmente, quando ocorrem esses sangramentos, suas caractersticas (volume, dura??o, aspecto, etc.) s?o diferentes de uma menstrua??o normal. Se h suspeita da mulher estar grvida (ou a gravidez j est confirmada) e ocorre um sangramento, ela deve consultar seu ginecologista ou um servi?o de urgncia para uma adequada avalia??o, pois sangramentos na gravidez, embora possam ocorrer sem que haja algo srio, n?o s?o normais e podem indicar um abortamento em curso.     Boa sorte|`|gkEaGcysaa	claro!!!lembra a semana passada???vc menstroa de quantos a quantos dias???vai a um medico e me de noticias...bjs papai!!!|`|FHKxkz3qaa	Provavelmente...

e195739b5d1e636fa11d4014602cf752aa	If you never had sex, than probably not.  I don't know by "other sexual things" what you have done. To be blunt, if your boyfriend ejaculated on you but not in you, you could (I've heard this somewhere) get pregnant. In the future, be careful and use protection (Birth Control and/or Condom). You can be pregnant and still get your period, so if you are really concerned: go to a drugstore and get a pregnancy test. You are probably not.|`|DNXB08mfaa	if sperm gets in your vagina then perhaps.  But thats the only way it can happen

I'm a quiet person and people say I'm a lot more mature than other teenagers.|`|AA11900069	My parents let me try drink at an early age.  They thought it would de-mistify it, and make it something I could either take or ignore.  They were wrong, I took to drink between the ages of 14-17, and not in a good way - it leaves me feeling suicidally-depressed.         I decided, when I heard that a friend had took his own life, whilst he was drunk, that I would never drink again, because people do stupid things when they have been drinking.          That was 25 years ago, and I haven't drunk since.  I don't even think about drinking anymore.|`|ZppPDSILaa	"They're not equipped to keep their decision-making skills while drunk"    So say somebody turns 18 and can legally drink and they go out and get totally smashed - they suddenly acquite skillfull decision making?

Do you know how many people would FREAK out?  That would be a VERY hard thing to do.    But you're right, people 14-17 shouldn't drink at all.  They're not equipped to keep their decision-making skills while drunk, and are apt to make some VERY dumb mistakes, ones that they will regret for a long time to come.  I've seen it happen MANY times.    And to the dork below me... I never said they magically acquire decision-making skills overnight, it obviously takes years.  Say, their TEENAGE years.  I used the range 14-17 because that was what the question asked! Helloooo ..   By the time they're 20 or so, they've seen a lot more of the world and are better for it.  And as with anything else, obviously this varies between individuals... some are more mature at 16, while others don't grow up until they're 30.|`|QXQty7rnaa	yes i agree I am in year 9 and this girl died and got brought back to life in hospital and then had to have her stomach pumped because she thought it would be cool to drink a 5 bottle of vodka|`|wENdWT5kaa	No, the problem is that parents DO NOT take the time to sit their children down and talk to them about it.     I was a teenager once, and my mom sat us down and talked to us about sex,drugs and alcohol. And guess what? I didn't have sex till i was in my twenties, never ever took drugs and waited till i was legal age to drink.     But that was my generation where our parents cared enough to make sure we knew between right and wrong.     The problem with todays society is that parents are either to busy or to damn lazy to take their time and talk to their children.

AA11808736	Querida, n?o fique ansiosa!!!  at engra?ado porque passei pela mesma situa??o que vc! Fiz ultrassom com 5 semanas e n?o vi nada! Isso  porque o nosso embri?ozinho  minsculo, incapaz do ultrassom visualizar. Porm ele ser visualizado com 7 semanas! Eu tive que repetir 2 semanas depois e l estava o embri?ozinho.  Em rela??o ao tamanho do saco gestacional, n?o se preocupe tbm. Quando fiz meu ultrassom de 7 semanas, me disseram que meu saco gestacional tinha o tamanho para 6 semanas! Novamente a mdica explicou que h uma margem de erro muito grande com essas primeiras medidas, j que est?o medindo algo em milmetros.  muito difcil!  Ent?o fique tranquilinha amiga, vc vai iniciar uma fase linda de sua vida, n?o se preocupe com esses pormenores. Tudo est de acordo com a semana em que vc se encontra!  Curta bastante a sua gravidez! Que Deus lhe aben?oe muito e proteja a vida desse ser que carrega em seu ventre! PARABNS!  bjs!

uZW1i2EPaa	Y si te vieran y trataran asi...    Observo tu cuerpo desnudo en mi cama mientras que vos, dormida, pareces parte de un sue?o.   Tu piel, destino deseado de mis besos, me atrae, me incita   Recorro con mi mirada tus caminos, esos en los cuales me suelo perder, y no puedo creer que seas real.   A veces, cuando te observo como ahora, llego a considerarme muy afortunado, incluso tal vez poco merecedor de semejante tesoro, por eso cuando te tengo, me dedico pacientemente a ser esclavo de tu placer, a recorrerte, a explorarte, a devolverte en pasin el privilegio de tenerte asi   Cuando te queds as, despus de hacer el amor, me pregunto ?Qu es el placer?..., y descubro que el placer no pasa por el deseo, que me invade desde que te veo venir, sabiendo que vas a ser ma, el placer mi amor es sentirte, es tenerte cerca, es disfrutar a cada instante del regalo de tu tiempo, de ese regalo para el cual me has elegido como destinatario y que yo, agradecido y halagado, me dedico a cultivar, hacindote el amor no solo en la cama, sino en la vida.   Mis pensamientos se diluyen y vuelvo a vos   Te diste vuelta, pero segus dormida, mostrndome ahora la carretera de tu espalda, ese camino que lleva a mis dedos en un lento viaje directo a tu portal, un viaje con mltiples paradas, donde cada centmetro de tu piel es destinataria de mis caricias, de mis besos.   Me pregunt, mientras sonro?Cul de tus rincones amor profanar?, no me decidoobservo tus axilas, tus peque?as orejas, tu cuello, la planta de tus pies, la forma redonda de tu cola y mi lengua inquieta y apresurada quiere lanzarse y dejar huella en vos, una huella hmeda que no solo te despertar, volvindote a la realidad, sino que servir para indicarte que una vez ms mis ganas solo desean tenerte, y por eso han comenzado nuevamente este juego que terminar cuando tus ansias y las mas se fundan, ardientes y agitadas, hasta hacer explotar nuestros deseos entre gemidos de placer     http://alzuj.blog.terra.com.ar/|`|a6ffea25c0aa401a19f230798b7a8fdaaa	El sabe que no sientes nada? Lo primero que debes hacer es decirle, que no es culpa de el, sino que a ti no te causa placer el sexo. Tampoco te causa placer masturbarte? Yo digo que lo mejor que ambos pueden hacer es visitar un sexologo, es la persona que mas te puede ayudar, y es muy bonito que ambos se involucren, si el no sabe que tu estas fingiendo o no sintiendo nada el se va a sentir peor y eso va a afectar la relacion enormemente, pues no estas siendo sincera con el ni contigo misma.|`|93cf639869610e52b8d31523fc3aa409aa	Primero tens que conocer tu cuerpo, qu te gusta y qu no, y experimentar con vos misma... por otro lado, si vos nunca antes habas tenido experiencias sexuales no pods decir que tu novio lo hace muy bien; primero porque no pods comparar y segundo porque hasta ahora no te ha hecho sentir satisfecha.  Me parece que deberas empezar por probar tener orgasmos masturbndote (si no lo has hecho an) y despus, si comprobs que sents placer, empezar a plantearte porqu tu novio no te hace sentir nada...  No es cuestin de tirar sobre vos toda la responsabilidad, sino ver qu posibilidades hay frente a lo que te pasa.  Y de ltima consult con algn profesional (psicologo-sexologo) que te oriente. Suerte!|`|JWaKC8eVaa	mira creo que debes buscar ayuda, no estoy bromeando, ve a un ginecolo, o a un medico, donde te sientas comoda, que le puedas decir lo que te ocurre. Esto puede ser un problema hormonal, como puede ser emocional, o no puede ser nada, pero tienes que investigar. Te cuento que hubo una epoca de mi vida que no tenia ni la mas minima ganas de tener sexo y cuando lo hacia no sentia nada... me preocupe y fui a donde un endocrinologo y resulta que tenia un desbanace hormonal, cuando me pusieron en tratamiento uffff, mejore, me gusta el sexo y lo disfruto.

Si la mantienes con una base de inseguridad, temor, miedo y pensando en consecuencias graves o que realmente esa relacin con esa diferencia de edad no es adecuada para t. Entiendo que tu relacin no sea placentera. Hay que descartar que no tengas algn tipo de patologa vaginal, que cause dolor en la relacin, o que haya algn tipo de desproporcn anatmica a la hora de relacionaros.  Si tu relacin sexual no es placentera hay que buscar la causa, antes de seguir practicando, ya que los resultados negativos pueden llegar a que te conviertas en frigida.  Por tanto, para, investiga, consulta con el especialista y valora desde el punto de vista afectivo que dicha relacin sea algo positivo; en caso contrario estas jugando con algo que despus te va a costar mucho poder cambiar.  La relacin tiene una base fsica, pero tiene otra muy importante que es la psicolgica; y es esta ltima la que realmente da valor al contacto interpersonal.|`|Qz8ZOU8laa	Gracias que linda igualmente!!... pues mira no es eso tal vez a muchas nos ha pasado, pero mira no es que tu sea frijida lo que pasa sq son tus primeras veces y aun no has disfrutado, cuando yo tenia 17 a?os fue mi primera vez con uno de 31 a?os y el me hizo sentir tan bien que lo disfrute y senti riquisimo mira lo que yo creo sq es el, y  aveces tal vez el sea egosta pues recuerda la edad que hay entre ambos y el esta encantado contigo como no??

You should check again just to be safe though and you can confirm to yourself that you're not pregnant.|`|AA11900069	If you had unprotected sex, you can be pregnant, because the only thing to cause pregnancy is... UNPROTECTED SEX!     You haven't asked about the whole myriad of STD's you could have contracted, starting with Chlamydia, moving thru Gonhorrea, and onto Syphillis and of course, HIV.  I would ask you, "what were you thinking?", but of course that would be rhetorical, for it is evident you weren't thinking at all.|`|aNsv0PPnaa	ignore that sick comment below,he is discusting,there could be a chance,get another test or blood test xxx|`|kykmpr0Caa	do another test or go to the doctor and find out . i cant believe the answer above what a horrible thing to say to someone|`|YkDnKdkgaa	those take at home tests don't work for sh!t.. go see a doctor if you really want to know.. they wont tell anyone if you don't want them to, not even your parents, they are required by law to keep all medical files confidential even from relatives. if you want you can make sure with your doctor that he/she won't share anything with anyone else, then bring up the problem. hope it all works out.    p.s. i dont think your pregnant.    i am assuming you are still living with your parents, if not then scratch that part and still go see a doctor, its the only way to know for sure.    DONT BE A FOOL! WRAP YOUR TOOL!|`|AA11439849	I do not think that you are pregnant. Usually periods while you are pregnant are just a light flow for a day or two. Sort of like spotting. If you bled heavily you are probably not. I would take another test in a few days. It will tell you for sure at that point if you are or not. Now is the time to take it because your body will start making the pregnancy hormones. So take another one and trust that one.

8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	Ciao,  premesso che non hai adottato nessuno ma stai facendo sostegno a distanza (questo perch i genitori adottivi o aspiranti tali potrebbero avere qualcosa da ridire), io e mia moglie stiamo sostenendo a distanza un bimbo in Kenia, purtroppo l'associazione in 3 anni ci ha fatto sapere solo il nome e dove questo bambino si trova.    Tutto dipende dalla seriet dell'Onlus con cui sostieni a distanza, molti sono seri e comunque i soldi non vanno mai al bambino, servono per pagare le spese per la sua istruzione o alimantazione o entrambi .    PS  Non li saprebbero gestire ??????  sono poveri non lobotomizzati , lo scopo  permettere ai bambini di studiare e con sostegni economici e alimentari restare e crescere nella famiglia di origine.  Come ho detto prima ci sono Onlus pi o meno serie, con i soldi dei sostegni a distanza molto probilmente vi saranno pagati o spesati i servizi che offriranno come ad esempio la scuola, l'ambulatorio, etc, quindi pagheranno medici, insegnanti , medicini , materiale, cibo etc,sarebbe sbagliato credere che se tu sostieni con 100 , tutti e 100 vengono riservati per il bimbo che  sostenuto da te.|`|Ev6Kv1Mbaa	Ciao!!  L'1 settembre era il mio compleanno e quando mamma mi ha chiesto cosa volessi come regalo io le ho risposto: mi piacerebbe adottare un bambino a distanza .. e cos  stato fatto.   mi rendo conto che essendo minorenne  molto impegnativa come cosa, ma io ci tengo davvero, e con l'aiuto della mia famiglia ce la posso fare. Non ho ancora nessuna notizia del/della bimbo/a, dovrebbe arrivarmi una lettera in questi giorni ,, se vuoi ti faccio sapere.  non sto pi nella pelle, non vedo l'ora di conoscere "mio" piccolo! ^^|`|nc7oRglkaa	pensa che io l'avevo fatto al liceo con la mia classe (ovvero 6 anni fa) un bambino del Bangladesh...non penso sia un fenomeno di nicchia,ma le persone a volte sono troppo superficiali, x esempio nella mia classe alcune persone non mettevano i soldi (era un euro a testa) dicendo che era inutile...ovviamente andando cos le cose alla fine del liceo, cio tre anni fa, l'adozione  rimasta a me e tre mie amiche che continuiamo...  cmq  vero i soldi non vanno direttamente a loro,ma  un bene xch la famiglia non li spenderebbe x esempio x l'educazione del figlio,dato che ovviamente avranno problemi maggiori...|`|zxDm7wI2aa	Che bello che ne avete adottato uno...  Se i soldi arrivano o se se li mette in tasca qualcuno, purtroppo dipende dall'associazione!!  Io so che all'orfanotrofio dove fui adottata io, arrivano ai bambini, per quando non le conosci  difficile capirlo...  Cmq conosco molte persone che hanno adottato un bimbo a distanza, quindi non credo sia un fenome di nicchia, anche se magari non  diffusissimo.    Appena trovo un lavoro, ne voglio adottare uno anche io!

Sinceramente credo che un aiuto le arrivi, non sono scettica...  ciao ciao|`|N2ooF4Pdaa	Io l'ho adottata insieme alla mia migliore amica nonch testimone di nozze. Siamo amiche fin da bambine e abbiamo pensato che il modo pi bello per festeggiare questa lunga amicizia poteva essere solamente adottare un bambino a distanza!    La nostra si Sonali ed  indiana.     Purtroppo  la terza bimba che ci cambiano, quindi non siamo ancora riusciti ad instaurare un vero e proprio rapporto epistolare.    La prima era del Guatemala, Cecilia, aveva 6 anni ed era ancora troppo piccina per scrivere lettere. E' stata la nostra bimba per circa 3 anni ... che emozione ricevere disegni e pagella!!  Purtroppo poi ci sono stati dei problemi con Fundacion Intervida in loco e la "fililiale" italiana ha deciso di dissociarsi e quindi ci hanno chiesto se volevamo continuare con un altro bimbo.    Cos  arrivata Chaitra, dall'India ...... pochi mesi e nuova telefonata. I genitori della bimba, si sono trasferiti altrove e quindi la bimba non seguir pi il progetto.    Adesso  da poco arrivata Sonali .... speriamo che non ci siano novit!    Pi avanti mi piacerebbe adottarne un altro insieme a mio marito....     Nonostante tutto, io ho fiducia in questa organizzazione. Sono veramente molto corretti e, sebbene "perdere" la nostra Cecilia ci sia dispiaciuto un sacco, condivido la scelta di questa associazione.  Mi avevano mandato anche un filmato con tutti i progetti in opera ....  Insomma si, io credo che i soldi arrivino a chi di dovere.... probabilmente finiscono un o' tutti nello stesso calderone .... ma in fondo che importa? Se il nostro bambino pu studiare grazie al nostro contributo, come vengano esattamente distribuiti i soldi che gli mandiamo  irrilevante ... in fondo sono tutti per i bimbi.    Un'altra cosa che mi  piaciuta molto di questa associazione  che ti permette di andare a trovarli. Quindi massima trasparenza.

Non credo sia un fenomeno cos poco diffuso dato che molti amici dei miei genitori lo hanno fatto, anche se di certo non lo fanno tutti. Io comunque trovo che sia una cosa splendida.
htSHh611aa	I have no clue, children are hard enough, add to that special needs and a "budding" career and you have a neglected child. I know that she has a father and a supportive family but come on, we all know how we feel. I know what that cry means, and when poopie time is.     Maybe that's it, she isn't as involved in her child's life to begin with... She was already entrenched in her career when she had the child. She is a little old to be still having babies, so maybe this was an whoopsie baby and she right away got a nanny or nurse for him. She also has some older children so maybe they have taken on a mothering role. That could explain the teen pregnancy, she might be thinking that she is already "Mommy" so what would be the difference to have one of her own...    Just conjecture, no one really knows, even the mom herself|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I want a rational explanation as to why she was chosen in the first place.  |`|SYBfPFcDaa	You sound like you're asking this about a specific person and I don't see how anybody could speculate on this without knowing the situation!|`|CKxL1eJkaa	Maybe she just needs a brake. I very well might need one.     I've raised my kids to be very independent and if I had one that was on me all the time I would go nuts but that is just me I am not in her situation.|`|AA11746917	Maybe she feels she can advocate for special needs children.|`|Tm1Rpfq4aa	She may be "running" from the situation because she is scared.|`|mnpYxMm2aa	i'm assuming you're taking about palin, and maybe its cause she cares more about her career, than her family.    EDIT: i also agree with brianna, alot of pressure has been put on here because of that (taking care of a special needs child while being vice president), but she should consider her childs needs, i mean even on her first speech her son getting shipped of to the war didn't seem so pleased.|`|MtrvRNj9aa	you're not going to like my answer but how about you just let Sarah Palin live her life, seeing as you dont know the situation and you really have no idea how good or bad of a mother she might be. That would be who you are talking about- correct?
a8IRxC4raa	It depends on the school.    To be honest, however, schools don't encourage creativity.  They encourage conformism.      All the best.|`|21K16h2eaa	No my private school doesnt even have art class|`|AA11746917	It depends on the teacher. Creativity comes from within the person, you know. And by the way, just so you know, not all private schools require that their teachers be credentialed. So if you are considering the private school option, be sure that their teachers are fully credentialed.|`|EpGiWmqsaa	Anything creative has to come out of your pocket book.   From art to music, and sports, etc.  |`|qEN5i6S9aa	Creativity in the classroom not only depends on the teacher, but the principal and other parents.  Some private schools have great art programs and others lack funding due to being a smaller school.  There are public schools that focus on the arts.  These are magnet schools.  Maybe you should look into that.    Rosanita |`|b731497d6623498903d3ef4246b276bdaa	It depends on the school and even more importantly --on the teachers and the funding that the school gets that year--also how active the PTA/PTO is--because these organizations in a public school often supplement and begin art and other creative classes in addition to what is normally offered at school.    Private schools have the money--and if they are focused on arts/creativity etc--then of course they will be good for creativity--but not all private schools focus on this--
a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	It does not matter what size it is , it is how they work it.      Does size matter?     And the survey says... Ever heard the phrase "It's not how deep you fish but it's how you wiggle your worm"? This seems to ring true for most women. In fact, a large size can even be painful for many women. The average vagina only measures 4" long with the ability to expand an extra inch. So, for a woman with the average vagina length, the ideal penis size for her would be approximately 6". This works out well since the average size of an erect penis is between 5" - 7"     http://www.teenadviceonline.com|`|bbd04237e9f447478807b4f37a4c3e9eaa	Don't think badly of me for saying the bigger the better ...|`|f6de866ae6e5cb65beb7f135f850c9d8aa	its the motion in the ocean not the size. if you know how to use it she will be satisfied.|`|AA10026038	This has nothing to do with trying to conceive.  That said, here's my answer...    It really depends on the the physiology of the woman.  Different vaginas are different sizes & shapes.  This has much much more to do with general body makeup than with sexual activity.  But, as the previous person said, it really isn't all about size.  And if you find yourself lacking in the size department, there are MANY other ways to satisfy a woman.  Take the time to learn to do these well & you'll do just fine.|`|7a7e24af8655f30e702dc8bebdaf12d6aa	all depends if the guy knows what he's doing with what he has. Also take time to learn what the womens needs are.  It's not all about size.|`|3d3a30dc8fac77e27b5cfb8ee3834b4caa	It's not the size that counts.  I have a small vibrator, not fat and no longer from tip to base than 5 or 6 inches.  Fills me great, without complete insertion.  I would never want anything bigger.    Here is a great song for you, I respect Maynard so much for this song:  "Maynard's D i c k" by Tool.  He doesn't say 7 inches; he doesn't say 8.  He says 6!  You have to respect that.    Oral sex for alot of women is as if not more pleasurable than penetration.  And many find digital (finger) stimulation to their clitoris just as satisfying.  And just think, pleasure her that way, and premature ejaculation becomes a non issue!
AA11298562	Yup.  It's called a 'false pregnancy', and it's been recorded throughout history.  When someone wants to be pregnant or believes it so strongly they can't think about anything else, the body responds.  On the flip side, some people go their entire pregnencies without knowing about it, they don't even stop having their period!  They sure are surprised when they go to the hospital with stomach pains and are told they're in labor.|`|Dx8gEpTEaa	yes i believ its in your mind too as the others thats why u c it but then again when u are pregnant after u finish eating in the begginning months when its tooo early to show somtimes u bloat up tooo that has happen in both my pregnancys so yeah.|`|AA10458750	Yes, this happens when you want a baby so bad....it gets n your head & somehow your body will prepare for a baby that isn't there. Some people have all the symtoms even...|`|4QTHSTbbaa	Yes, im going through that right now!|`|PZhhuawFaa	Yes. The mind is a powerful tool.|`|DneneGsxaa	I have felt bloated for like a month now, i don't know wat my deal is,.. i may just be gaining weight. who knows..... but if you think you are, your mind may be telling you that you are and you are getting the symptoms and you will actually have a false pregnancy, where it is just all in your head. :) Good luck cuz that is not fun at all... :( especially if you really want to be. Good luck.
zvAQf7hnaa	Hiya, i got pregnant at 19 and my daughter is 8months old now :) It is amazing but be warned it is very hard work, its not all about baby names and dressing them up. It was a complete shock to my system, it all depends what you want out of life and if you are happy together i say go for it    =D|`|IcUEDkoraa	I think it is fine to have a baby at that age, i had my first at 17, and 6 years later we are still happy and have a second child, as long as your sure its what you want and your happy then i say go for it and good luck hope you have luck soon xxx|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I dont think you're too young.  I think its irresponsible to knowingly bring a child into the world under unstable circumstances etc but you sound like you're in a happy, settled relationship. I doubt any dr would pass judgement on you, it wouldnt be professional and you're an adult. Good luck :)|`|NlAi17XXaa	its not young parents that are bad its the ones who cant afford to keep their kids and live off benefits, theyre the scum.|`|DrC3u1Mqaa	i dont really know...if the baby was an accident then i think that you are too young and not ready but if it was planed then you are probably ready...hope i helped...good luck|`|4M3fHMciaa	I don't think the problem is with you being "too young" or not, I think it really has to do with whether you have the means. I am 19 and my boyfriend is also 23 and while I believe I would like to start a family with him someday, I know right now we wouldn't be able to afford it.  If I were you I would seriously look at you and your partners finances and see if you're well off enough to have a child.  Clothes, food, health care, toys, diapers...you're probably looking at thousands of dollars within the first year.    All I'm saying is think about it.  Whatever you decide, I wish you the best of luck.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	I have nothing wrong with people having children at 19.    But, do you own/rent a house?  Do you both have jobs/careers?  Have you got some sort of savings?     If you answered no to any of the above question, it's not the right time to have a baby!|`|T4t9ZtT7aa	Age is just a number. If you are ready then you are ready, being 29 or 30 doesn't mean your ready. But think about it seriously, its a big commitment, can you offer a child a stable, financially secure home? WHat about your career? Are you willing to put it off for a long time or even give up on it completely? You need to think about more than just what other people think of you having a baby. COuld you cope? A baby can be an amazing thing to bring into the world but don't do it until you, your boyfriend and your lifestyle are completely ready for it. If you think you are then go for it, its your choice, not anybody elses. Good luck whatever you decide. :)|`|AA11900069	What on Earth are you thinking!  How about developing yourself, your career, earning a few bucks and making something of a secure future for your future children?  In general, people who wait and breed later, in their mid-thirties, have their lives in much better shape, and can provide for their children far better.  Their children tend to be happier and healthier, and more successful.       On a personal note, you have been together for the eternity of three years!  I actually have clothes older than you are, and I can tell you that you - and he - will change on a FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL, in the next five years, or the next ten certainly.  You will likely both become very different people, and possibly turn to very different paths in your lives.  Don't expect children to be a glue to keep you together.  Children of the youngest parents tend to share one thing in common - divorced parents!|`|M6yCVajaaa	I had my first son when i was 19 and to be honest i found i had loads of energy, patience, enthusiasm etc.  It was a lot easier than when i had my last baby at 34, i was tired, cranky, had little patience and just felt really fed up with everything.  So in my opinion young mums have a huge advantage over older more mature mums.  If its what you both want and you have been together a long time..go for it, dont worry what others think.|`|TAGQ4FQQaa	id say yes your young and u shud both live ur lives BUT my parents had their 1st when they were 19, they had 3 in all and got married, we never went without, and they loved bringing us up while they were young now they are still young enough to enjoy their grandchildren. 30yrs later they r still 2gether. my point is..if u and ur fella are happy and stable then go for it and good luck! x|`|RNZaUdxSaa	I feel as long as you are financially stable then who gives a damn what people think!!! I just turned 20 and I was pregnant and miscarried and my fiance and I are defiantly going to try again as soon as the dr. oks me!! It did hit us the day we found out I was pregnant how big of a deal it was and that was when we realized its gonna be more then what we expected but we prepared ourselves because its what we both really want!! I think if people see you are serious then they will keep there mouth shut.. The ones people talk about are the young dumb girls who have babies then pawn them off to there moms or grandparents so they can go out ALL the time!! And the ones who don't even know who the father is! If your happy.. have your life in order and head on straight..and that's what you really want then go for it girl.. its your life!!  Just think it all over... you'll know if your ready or not!! Best of luck!!:)|`|YpgoGNuXaa	I think having a child sounds wonderful at 19!

It's somethig only you can decide.|`|Tb8El1zuaa	Who cares what people think. You're an adult and it's your decision. I'm 20 and I had my first son 3 days after I turned 19 and my second son 6 days before I turned 20. If you and your boyfriend are committed to each other and are ready for this step then go for it. |`|rpRshQRaaa	i doubt they'll tell you you're too young, they may ask if you're sure etc and talk it through with you. If you live together then if you are sure go for it, don't worry about other peoples opinions, if you are happy then that is whats important however if you don't live together maybe try it for a bit, you may find you have major issues with incompatibility in which case having a baby together isnt the best of ideas.|`|FWDRZJBiaa	listen.. if your ready, your ready. but when i was that age i was really broody too, but i'm glad i waited a few years (i'm now 27 and pregnant) coz now i'm really ready to settle, i've done all my running at the weekend so i know i'll not miss much and i've more patience.|`|qcRWC2t9aa	19 is not that young at all. Go For it!!|`|Vfsnqlscaa	aww thats sweet.. ur not too young!!! go ahead chicka and go have urself a baby =)|`|7stQIB7baa	What's the rush. I know the feeling that you want a baby can be overpowering sometimes, but it will still be wonderfull when ever it happens.    Why don't you spend a few years enjoying your youth, making a home with your partner, and enjoying each other company - just the two of you. once you've have a baby all that will be gone so you should enjoy the freedom you have.    People will tell you your too young. your not a mature adult yet, no matter how grown up you might feel. at 19 you will not be able to offer your baby what you could at 25 when you have more life experience.    |`|zbwZ1cupaa	Other people's opions shouldn't matter regardless. People will always have something to say about everything, even if you are 35. If you honestly feel you are ready for that kind of commitment, you do what's best for you. Don't let others be the deciding factor. Also, if your doctor tells you you are too young and disregards you...go see another doctor until you find one that is compassionate and thinks of your needs.|`|rIoXu7Olaa	I had my daughter when i was 18yrs old, yes i suppose i was a bit young but we have grown up together and she`s now my best friend. I had my second when i was 28yrs old and they classed me as a geriatric mum...you cant win...do whats right for you, ignore what other people might say|`|dbcILDdSaa	I don't think that you are too young. I got married at 19 and had my first child 3 days after my 21st birthday.   Although everybody thought my husband and I were too young to get married and  have children. We now have 3 children, they are 7, almost 3 and one year old. I look at it this way, I would much rather be a young parent than one that waits until late 30s early 40s. I say if you and your boyfriend are serious than GO FO IT!|`|NpFmdjlvaa	Its not too young!!! just aslong as you both feel ready as having a baby is a huge change in your life!! i got pregnant just before my 18th!! hes now nearly 20 months old now ( growing up way too fast!! :( ) and im now 18 weeks pregnant with our 2nd!! at 20! couldnt be more happier!!   :)   go 4 it girl :)|`|OzYAx9wvaa	i do not think u r too young especially considering u have been with ur partner for 3 years.  if u both feel ready for it, go for it!  Though be warned, it is a massive shock to the system and so much hard work...but very rewarding.    I just have to say to insomnia...There is nothing wrong with young people having kids and not all young people who get married and have kids will will end up with a divorce.  My parents were 19 when they married and had their first baby.  within 4 years they had 3 of us...30 yars later they r still together.  I met my partner when i was 17, we r still together, just got married and had our first baby, we r still going strong and i am now 24 (25 nxt month) Age does not always equal maturity..i think ur answer proved that!|`|RBZnNmTkaa	19 is not to young my husband is 5 years younger than me and he was 19 when we got married and he was 20 when we had our 1st child and he is a great dad. we are still together 6 years on. don't be to bottherd about what pepole think what has it got to do with them as long as you are happy go for it.xx|`|758cDKEFaa	dont listen to the people who say your too young.  16 is the iegal age to have sex so your not doing anything wrong.  i had my little boy when i was 16 and im now 17.  you shouldnt care what people think, its there fault if they choose to stoop so low.  yes, i have some people now and then that give me strange looks or talk about me but its not a crime that i didnt murder my own baby.  i made a brave choice, stood up for what i believe in and people should understand and respect that.  and i still managed to do ebtter than loads of people in my GCSE's at 6 and half month pregnant :)  your doctor wont say that, he/she may ask if youve thought it through but thats about it.  he/she cant stop you from having a baby.  i say go for it, like you said your happy in love, what else should matter?|`|z29PIEWKaa	well at 19 you're an adult and capable of making you're own decisions. don't worry about other people so much, its your life not theirs.

AA11226053	I would say she should be able to test on Dec. 22nd by doing the simple math, if her dates are right.  And I don't think you can legally fight for a abortion or adoption...it is her body, her choice!  However yeah if she is, please save the baby from phsyco mommy & try for full custody no visitation, if your story is 100% truth that is.  Best of Luck!|`|bbd04237e9f447478807b4f37a4c3e9eaa	Oh wow i was right .. you are a poor aussie boy .. you have a few more weeks to wait yet, do you have any idea when her period is due .. theres no point in calling something 'it' when you dont know that 'it' even exists. There is a chance she could be pregnant, given all you have said is true, but you will have to wait to find out. chances are she is just winding you up, but if she lied to you once, she will do it again. Im in Aus also if you feel you need to email someone to talk more bout it.|`|80670b66838349abf610f7f510cd7bd5aa	First off, I do not believe in abortion, it is not the baby's fault....    also we all take chances when we have sex,  that was pretty messed up she did, but if she does get pregnant, that is your sperm and you will be the father.  Good Luck and I hope everything works out for you.|`|AA11162416	ok...if your condom was coated with nonoxynol-9, a spermicidal lubricant, the chances are slimmer than if it was not, BUT...    "Sperm are alive and active as long as they are wet. If the area if moist and damp the sperm can live 48-72 hours. Inside the body the sperm are alive for much longer and are therefore viable for a longer duration. Once the sperm becomes dry it is safe to say that they are no longer living. Sperm are very determined little creatures. Active sperm placed near the vagina can find their way into the body to fertilize the ovum. Pregnancy can and does happen this way."

wENdWT5kaa	They  are probably trying to give them a name that no one has.    I'm all for unique, but they have to be names. Verizon and Seven is over board and just plain awful. And technically they are not unique names, Verizon is known all over the world for being a cell phone and Seven, we all know is the number 7. So how unique are they. Not really. They just sound stupid on people.     With my daughter i wanted a name that you hardly hear, (which in my opinion, i would consider unique), we named her Mikayla (but of course after she was born, i came across quite a few of them, lol).     But with my son, we are going with regular names, Christopher.     I just wish pple would stop making up names and naming the child after objects, days, months and now numbers. Yeesh.|`|AA11210211	I agree to some extend ,I think it is okay if there is meaning behind the name,and in most cases there is.Like my daughters name is September Rene,BUT there is A LOT of meaning behind it and it's not to out there.A lot of people now days I think are tired of the same ole names so they try to make their child's name stand out.|`|9BtA5Knfaa	Because I think every body's sick of being the "PLAIN JOHN OR PLAIN JANE" anymore!    So be unique and let your child's name reflect just that!|`|hXQjnPuGaa	Well I don't think Verizon is that bad. It's not as bad as some of those super-trendy ones that everyone is using right now.    You picked some rather popular names for your children. I know 2 little Emily's an Emmaleigh, and an Emilia. You also hear a lot of people on here using Lynn, or just tacking it onto the end of any name (Emmalyn, blah!), Adeline is also pretty common, although most people are spelling it Adalyn. Other popular names are Sophia, Isabelle, Jaden (and anythign that rhymes with it), McKensie, and Madison.   There's no way that I would use any of those names, just because they are popular. I don't want my child to be one of 7 in her grade at school. It wasn't that long ago that I was in highschool, and always had a good chuckle when the teacher said asked Ashlea a question, and Asheley, Ashlee, Ashlie, Ashlie, Ashlyn, and Ashley all answered. I wouldn't want that to happen to my kid.     I agree, that Verizon, and Seven, are pretty bad names, not ones that I would ever use, but I'd rather have a strange name than a common one.   Names that I like are  Sybil  Gemma  Cecily  Iris  So not common, but still unique, and "normal" at the same time. |`|CMuL7XpKaa	Congratulations on your Twins and Good luck (Mono-Mono twins are usually born early by c-section because they are afraid of death to the twins by cord entanglement)  I like classic names like Sarah, Leah, Samuel, and Benjamin but i also like popular names Like Katelyn and Sophia, I like th names Taliah and Kaylyn too (they are unique)  Audrinna is the longer version of Audrey|`|d6e11chxaa	I think people mistake unique names for interesting people. I mean, I like names that are underused but classic, like Gideon or Daphne, but they're real names. I can't stand made up names like Tanessa or Klayden. They're frustrating to have. I also like, but tend to shy away from, the common classics, like Jacob, Emily, etc. I would prefer to meet a Hannah than a Nevaeh!|`|hhHSf9V1aa	well first of i i really like your daughters names and congrats on the twins:) Anyways i feel that people want to be different and unique so the name there kids pretty silly names, i feel the same way you do my kids names are Tyler Gabriel, Ian Micheal, and Blair Elizabeth and i feel that they are unique yet classic|`|RGXB8ayPaa	To make their child different than others|`|AA11746917	People do it for themselves. They think giving their child a unique name will somehow make them special. The truth is, some of these names are downright sad, especially when it's a traditional name with a "unique" spelling. (ex: Brian = Brahain)    I think what parents need to realize is that giving a child a unique name doesn't make them special, it makes things more dificult for them. I know this because I have a very unusual first name. No one ever knows how to pronounce it. If I'm giving personal information over the phone and someone asks for my first name, I always say, "Let me spell it for you" And when I go to a restaurant, I always give my friend's name to put on the wait list. Not a lot of fun.|`|t6tjpuwraa	I definitely agree with you. I'm all for classy, elegant, names. But to defend some of the parents out there who want "one of a kind" children, I guess they just want their baby to be extra special. And I know a name doesn't make them any specialer than another child, some people think it does. Some people think that a name is super important and that everyone will judge, but it's who the person really is that matters. I have 3 kids, their names are Isabella Eden (Bella), Shia Dominic, and Evangeline Lily (Evie). I think their names are beautiful and so are they.|`|O5aHjOocaa	Congrats on the twins, I have twins and they are AWESOME!! The names of my children are unique but I don't think they are odd. I love their names.  Malachi Zamar-Killian  Zion David-Mordecai  Paris Rayne  Israel Jacob (Jakey)  I named my daughter Paris before Paris Hilton was in the news all of the time. I might have chosen a different name for her. (LOL)|`|AA11394459	Everyone like unique names for their child. I want a unique name, but i wouldnt name my kids Computer and Mouse Pad.|`|IXCR8ytCaa	Some people I guess just like unique names, not sure why, but they do.   My girls names are Mikayla, Savannah, Ellie, Ashley, Emma, and Leah so as you can see I like more used names, but not too used-but it looks like Emma and Mikayla are being used more, although at the time I named them, I didn't know anyone with those names, but now I know 3 Mikayla's and 2 Emma's.|`|0Xl9BLOdaa	I like some unique names, but not others.  Parents tend to not want their kid to be one of 10 Amanda's that they know personally, or 20 John's.  I think that's where they're coming from.      I have a unique name- Zalika Morsa, which I love because I've never met another Zalika.  I'd rather be Zalika than Elizabeth or Stephanie or Kaitlyn.  But I'd also rather be Ashley than JaMesha, Luanna, Allysibithe (yes, it's pronounced Elizabeth, but I personally know an idiot who spelled it like this), Riley, or Rashondra.  I see some AWFUL names on here, both in the unique section and the overused section.      My fiance and I made up our second daughter's name, but we originally used the name as a character in a book we wrote.  The name is Jarzi, which isn't too weird, so we chose it as the character was the hero of the story and it had special meaning to us.  Our other daughter, Kristan, was named after my two friends, Kristin and Krystan with a combined spelling.    I like your twin names, by the way.  They're cute and will fit them throughout life.  However, I do think Adeline Christine Violet would flow a bit better than Adeline Violet Christine.  Just my opinion, though.      Now, who the heck would want to name their kid VERIZON?  *shudders*|`|owdNmfObaa	ok...um maybe the person who said "Verizon" was kidding or a troll.....the person who said "seven" probably forgot the "t".     I think Emily Elizabeth is a name from a show my kids watch called "Clifford the Big Red Dog"[i think thats the name]...also Elizabeth is one of the most common middle names ive heard, Emily is in the Top Ten Most Popular Baby Names list.     the names you piked for your twins dont flow very well, especially since your giving them THREE names? i mean honestly please dont do that to them! also, matching names for twins is not something im very fond of to be honest with you.     what about Christina Violet and Audrey Hazel (Lynn is very common)      BUT anyways,   people name their kids these crazy names because they want the name to stand out! names like Avery, Lynn, Emma [actually this is my daughter's name], Lilly, Hayden, etc are far too common now! please have an open mina and remember they arent your children, so if the people dont listen to your advice, your life will not come to an end      sorry for the criticism but i thought somebdoy had to say something|`|2Fwybgpzaa	People are trying to be different, and unfortunately they turn out way too different.  However, you got to understand that a lot of people that choose these unique names have plain extremely common names themeselves.  I hate walking into a room knowing there are tons of other William's and Aaron's in the room. However, I don't plan on naming my child "Verizon." I have heard boys with the name Seven, but I am not going to say anything about it, because I find that to be alot better than of some what I have heard of. For example I know two people with the last name Peters and the girls first name is Edith and the boys name is Eden, the girl can get married but the poor boy will have Eden Peters as his name for his whole life.|`|QlulDOBaaa	Not everybody wants an outrageous name for their child, but I don't know many people who want their child to be one of 10 kids in their class with the same name.   My name is Rachel and growing up there were 6 other Rachel's in my grade level alone. And, right now I'm at the point where I starting to try for a child and I definitely don't want them to be one of 6 like I was, I want them to have a name they can call their own and yet not feel like their name is stupid.  Some people pick names based on their culture, some people pick names based on other family members names, and some people just want a great stand out name. There's nothing wrong with that.   I know my children will have names that their peers around them won't have, but they are not outrageous my any means, just maybe not your cup of tea!|`|jUgjsY46aa	because they want their child to be special!

LGnDuYizaa	Priam adi tutto devi ottenere l'idoneit all'adozione da un Tribunale italiano, dato ci che racconti, i requisiti li avete.  Poi tramite un'associazione deciddi il paese dal quale adottare, a quel purno "ti viene assegnato" un bambino adottabile. Cominciano gli incontri. Nel tuo caso se i bimbi sono gi adottabili, questa fase della conoscenza diciamo che potrebbe essere ridotta.  Quello che "paghi"  una tassa al paese, tassa per gli oneri burocratici, consolati, enti vari, insomma varia da paese a paese, ma per i paesi dell'est che sono ancora quelli pi economici, mi dispiace parlare cos perch sempre di bimbi parliamo, varia da 3500 a max 4500 euro a bambino.  Ciao ed in bocca al lupo|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	Ciao,  in primis devi essere dichiarata idonea all' adozione internazionale, e quindi, come tutte le coppie che si sono rese disponibili all' adozione devi presentare domanda di disponibilit all' adozione al tribunale dei minore di competenza. Ti consiglio, prima di fare ci, di recarti alla ASL di competenza dai Servizi Sociali, loro possono darti molte informaizoni.  Dopodich ci sar un iter con i Servizi sociali della tua zona che dura dai 6 ai 9 mesi con 5/6 incontri con psicologi e assistenti sociali.  Uno volta pronta la relazione i SS invieranno questa al TdM , un avrai un incontro con il giudice che di dir se siete idonei o meno per l' adozione internazionale.  Una volta avuta l' idoneit devi trovare un Ente che opera in Bielorussia, e con loro seguire la prassi per una adozione nominativa (sempre che nel frattempo il bambino sia diventato adottabile e che non sia stato adottato da altri).  Tieni presente che le adozioni con la Bielorussia non mi sembra che siano molto profique, non vorrei che la Bielorussia abbia bloccato le adozioni internazionali.  Ci sono questi Enti per l'adozione Internazionale che lavorano con la Bielorissia :  AAA ASSOCIAZIONE ADOZIONI ALFABETO ONLUS  ARIETE ONLUS  ASSOCIAZIONE BAMBINI CHERNOBYL O.N.L.U.S.  ASSOCIAZIONE CICOGNA AMICI DI CHERNOBYL  ONLUS  ASSOCIAZIONE ITALIANA PRO ADOZIONI  A.I.P.A. - ONLUS ERGA PUEROS  ASSOCIAZIONE PER L'ADOZIONE INTERNAZIONALE BRUTIA - ONLUS  RETE SPERANZA ORGANIZZAZIONE NON LUCRATIVA DI UTILITA' SOCIALE ONLUS  in ogni caso sul sito www.commissioneadozioni.it   trovi tutte le informazioni a riguardo.  Spero di esserti stato utile.  Zio Auo|`|1p1u3akdaa	 una cosa troppo seria, devi rivolgerti agli uffici addetti|`|o06WMTX9aa	non  detto che i bambini vengano dichiarati adottbili in tempi brevi, anzi,i tempi della legge  sono  sempre lunghissimi!  poi pi che di problemi economici ci s deve preoccuare di risultare idonei e non  facile (se poi si hanno problemi d'ansia peggio ancora).  Solitamente si fa richiesta di possibile affido ai parenti fino al 4 grado.  Per consigli ti d il sito di un associazione (www.aibi.it) ciao!|`|xVu7wFGraa	Olla un mio amico ha adottato due bambini del Sud america l' iter-burocratico  stato lungo e costoso, i dettagli non li so ma posso informarmi.  ti auguro tutto il bene di questo mondo ti faccio  i miei migliori auguri di Buon Natale e felice anno nuovo. un abbraccio  ciao|`|EwbaWuYOaa	SCUSATE AL DI LA DI QUELLO CHE VUOLE SAPERE QUESTO AVATAR MA CI PENSATE CHE MO PURE I BAMBINI IN ADOZIONE STANNO COMINCIANDO A COSTARE SOLDI (CHE POI MICA ADESSO E INCOMINCIATA STA COSA)???????????????????????????????????...
AA11298562	Interaction with real people.  The more a child is talked to, made eye contact with, and played with, the more neurons and pathways the brain develops.|`|ERuAlVhRaa	Don't talk to your child in baby talk. Say words clearly and in an audible tone.     Constantly talk to your child, all the time.     One of my friends has a 14 month old. She doesn't use gibberish and she's always talking to her baby as if the baby could understand all words and conversation.    Music. Music. Music.

One group of preschoolers were told that if they colored for a certain amount of time they would get a prize.  The second group of preschoolers were also told to color, but were not told about the prize. The third group of Preschoolers were put in a room with different kinds of activites.    the result of this study was that the second and third group of kids were more motivated to go back to coloring the next time they had their ''free time" and that the first group of kids felt that coloring for a prize was more like work.    So Im not sure if I answered your question, but i wanted to share this little peace of info.|`|sSrwcZb9aa	Talk to your child like they're an adult. You'd be surprised at how young some children can carry on full conversations if they're treated like they're capable of it.    Music is good - my parents had us listening to classical music when we were little kids, and now I've played the piano for 13+ years and the guitar (sort of, LOL) for one and I really appreciate it, although I hated piano lessons as a kid until the day I got my hands on some Coldplay sheet music, and I've LOVED it ever since.    Limited TV time is awesome - let your kids do chemistry experiments, build snow forts, go outside at 10 PM to look at the stars through a telescope, or dig pits in the backyard and pretend to be archaeologists or do chemistry experiments in the porch instead. Will it destroy any hope you had of landscaping? Yes. Will your kids have to take a bath every single night? Yep. But is it better than them watching TV, and will it be beneficial to them? Also yes - I remember the highlight of one of our summers was when my siblings and I found an arrowhead in our 'archaeological dig' (ie, a perfectly constructed 4' by 4' by 3' deep pit in our backyard, we sifted through the dirt and everything!) and as a result we spent the next week at libraries, local historical societies, museums, and such trying to identify our arrowhead. As a result, we learned a lot about the Native American culture in our area, as well as the local history.    Also, toys that aren't programmed to do anything are cool, especially construction toys or toys like Legos. My brother and I especially loved K'nex as kids, and before we were out of grade school we'd be looking on the internet to find out ways to improve the stability and strength of our structures (we both ended up going to engineering school - K'nex especially are good for kids who like math or science). Dolls that didn't talk or anything were fun - we'd build houses for them out of furniture, and have endless adventures, as opposed to the ones you can buy that will just cry and you give them the little magnetic spoon or change their magnetic diaper or whatever that we'd quickly get bored of.
SD7UrV6Daa	Io no, anche se ho 15 anni l' argomento mi tocca molto, perch credo che anche da grande potrebbe avere difficolt. Secondo me sono indispensabili entrambe le figure, che dovranno mostrarsi disponibili e sensibili ai progressi, alle esigenze e ai cambiamenti del bambino. I due genitori secondo me devono cooperare, poich ognuno di loro gli fornir diversi insegnamenti. Attenzione, per, se i due genitori non vanno d' accordo, io preferirei che il bambino venga accudito solo da uno dei 2, poich sarebbe dannoso esporlo a continui litigi. Si sa che i bambini apprendono molto per imitazione, quindi come si comporteranno da grandi?|`|JHFhuiPJaa	NN SAPEVO KE L'AVESSE FATTA.....CMQ X ME VA BN|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	una proposta lodevole...peccato che non passer mai al Parlamento Italiano.

8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	Non ci sono limiti di et , l'unico limite  che la differenza tra minore e genitore pi anziano sia di 45 anni per l'adozione Nazionale, ergo se hai 50 anni teoricamente potresti adottare un bimbo di 5 anni. Per l'adozione Internazionale valgono le norme proprie del Paese.  L'adozione  molto costosa se si parla di adozione Internazionale (per l'adozione Nazionale  gratuita) chiaramente dipende dal paese, da quanto tempi devi soggiornarci o quanti viaggi ci devi fare, indicativamente "all inclusive" si gira attorno ai 20000 dove il 50%  possibile averlo come rimborso dal 730.  Il primo passo  quello di presentare la domanda di disponibilit all'adozione e questo  possibile farlo nel Tribunale dei Minori di competenza. Consiglio , prima di presentare qualsiasi domanda, passa alla tua ASL, ti sapranno sicuramente dare informazioni preziose.  Per il percorso hai sicuramente necessit di molta pazienza, per l'adozione Internazionale il tempo medio  3/4 anni dalla domanda di disponibilit. Per l'Adozione Nazionale, tutto dipende dalla fortuna e sicuramente , se hai fortuna e sei una delle 20 coppie che in Italia possono accedere all'adozione nazionale (5% di possibilit), entro tre anni dalla presentazione della domanda di disponibilit.

8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	Adottare un bambino costa, ma i soldi non servono , come lasci intendere nella tua domanda per "comperare" un bambino , poi i disonesti che lo fanno non fanno testo.  Iniziamo col dire che l'adozione costa se si parla di adozione Internazionale.  Ci sono una serie di documenti da produrre tradotti e delle prodedure da seguire , prima in Italia con un Ente autorizzato , poi con il Paese Estero.   Ci significa notai traduttori abilitati, spese dell'Ente , tempo telefono, luce affitto etc.  Sia per la parte Italiana, che per la parte paese Estero, ci sono delle tabelle con le cifre massime di riferimento, che variano da Paese a Paese.  Le tabelle le puoi trovare pubblicamente sul sito delle adozioni internazionali. www.commissioneadozioni.it  Tanto per capirci la parte Italiana pu essere 2000/3000  , e comunque varia per ogn i paese , mentre la quota estera che anche questa varia da paese a paese, non vorrei dire cifre astruse, in quanto non le conosco tutte, si arriva fino ad un 5000 .  Da aggiungere ci sono i voli aerei il vitto e alloggio nel Paese.  Ci sono dei paesi dove devi fare 3 viaggi ognuno pi o meno di una settimana , altri Peasi dove devi soggiornare fino a 6 mesi (Kenya).  Come vedi le cifre variano tantissimo.  Per convenzione si "dice" che l'adozione Internazionale costa attorno ai 20000 tutto incluso (procedure Italiane, Estere, viaggi , vitto e alloggio).  Tieni presente che il 50% di tutte le spese sostenute sono rimborsabile con il 730.

Geralmente este tipo de situacoes acontecem em relacoes extraconjugais, o que remete ao homem a tomar uma atitude dramatica e desohumana perante um situacao de gravides nao desejada apesar de ter o conhecimento previa do acto q esta praticando. Agora eu diria q para se evitar este tipo situacoes q resultam em graves problemas para a sociedade, desde criancas da rua ate acabarem como marginais por falta de parentes, a uma necessidade urgente dos homens mudarem de comportamento, sobretudo criarmos um mente saudavel em relacao as nossas parceiras.

I knew from the moment I got pregnant she was going to be a girl. Call it mother's intuition. I even had dreams of a little girl. The first trisemester I was nauseated everyday and tired and moody with the worst aching breast. But for the past month Ive been feeling pretty good. My boobs still ache but Ive only gotten sick and throwed up once, but that was because I ate too much and it was spicy food. I can feel her moving around and bumping my stomach. And my appetite is so huge right now, that it feels like I can never get full, and it never seems like I bring enough food to work. And my stomach has gotten noticable in the past month. Im overweight so before it just looked like I had just gained weight. Im retaining water right now so I think that is part of the 20 pounds Ive gained so far. Other than that im just waiting for the day my little girl gets here. |`|ftrFpwKAaa	Im 30 weeks one day pregnant, with my first baby, a boy!!

14pjwQPLaa	The girls love it -- most of them wear short dressy dresses.  The guys wear a coat and tie, but the coat and tie usually gets ditched the first ten minutes of the dance :-)      Homecoming week at my daughter's school has a theme. This year it was "Superheroes", where on Homecoming Friday the seniors came dressed as superheros, the juniors were villains, etc.  They decorated their halls, etc.  Game on Friday night, then dance on Saturday night.  Since it's the only dance the school has, other than the prom, it's pretty popular with the whole high school.  Lots of people go in groups, without dates.|`|Qz4n1l0zaa	Dress up, it could be fun! If you're one of those types of people who will only do it if your friends do it, then don't because I understand that logic. But just remember: when you look back, you may want to look at pics or have those man-those-were-the-days type memories. I think overall, it will be worth it. |`|GTZa0H9waa	Yes we do,it's lame and I have no particapation to it haha,though I might do Friday's    Monday was camo day  Today,I don't even know  Tomorrow is professional day  Thursday Class colors  Friday Maroon and white    |`|PhffilBdaa	Years ago, I remember having the whole "Homecoming week" thing.  I remember they had Farmer Day, Pajama Day, School Color Day, 80's Day, and some other days that I have apparently blocked from my mind.  No, I never dressed up, although I do think I did pajama day one year because I didn't feel like getting dressed that morning LOL.  I was never one for school spirit though.  I always just went to the dance to have an excuse to get my hair and nails done, and buy a new dress.|`|puEjSoDfaa	Our school has them, I think they are stupid and I don't want to take the time out of my morning to look like a fool all day so I don't do it, but a lot of people have fun with it, I can just be kinda pessimistic|`|1CslMPTLaa	lol, yea our school does too, i personally think they are stupid... the only one i do is spirit day.. lol and even then i just wear a red t-shirt (we're the redbirds) lol|`|xIW8SyORaa	pj day  nerd day  greek day  dysney day  class color day      LAME! |`|Ii7vzF65aa	My  School Does dress up. I like some days. But others... Like the Super Hero day is stupid! So I just do spirit day and camo day.  
ZEO7RhGzaa	I never liked it.  It's really annoying, and if a guy goes so far as to fight over me, I'm not interested.  If I liked him, then I would be with him.  There wouldn't be a point in fighting over it.    I don't think it's amusing, I think it's pathetic.|`|4QTHSTbbaa	It shows how much the guy likes the girl! |`|puEjSoDfaa	It makes them feel wanted and like someone actually cares about them enough to fight over them|`|rMn7OOCXaa	it's like the doe who grazes while 2 bucks bash their brains out and lock antlers fighting over her, and she'll 'do' whoever wins.    the bucks have it hard at first, but later she'll be raising the fawn while the buck is off chewing bark off of trees    it's nature|`|v2SWMLXPaa	They like to be wanted because most teenage girls have like no self esteem and they get all their self worth from guys so having two guys fight over them makes them feel good about themselves. It's sad but true. Puberty sucks. Lol. |`|3c645076478917e58db01106a02c0197aa	"most young women are nowadays, evil and conservative."    Wow. No wonder you don't have a girlfriend...|`|46FM4Ms3aa	they like feeling wanted.|`|mved35RQaa	they feel important when it happens.  
7a8qCNU2aa	The requirement for parental consent depends on your state of residence. Also, if you're a ward of the court... wouldn't this be something you need to talk to your social worker about? I guess you wouldn't be required to tell your mom if she's not your guardian.    I don't know how you could get it for free... abortions are typically $300-600. Ask the guy who impregnated you for some fundage, ask your social worker if a sliding scale fee or payment plan could be arranged with the clinic.    Edit: There IS a parental consent law in Michigan... I don't know how it would work with you being a ward of the state. Your guardian has to consent to the abortion.    People often cross state lines to have an abortion without parental notification. I live in IL, and there's no law for guardian's consent here. Just sayin'.|`|AA10504387	In Michigan the law is that a parent must be notified.  It is possible for you to travel to another state however and not notify your parents.  Illinois is one state that does not have a notification law.  For information on other states:  http://www.reproductiverights.org/st_law...    As a minor, you may find it difficult to travel to another state to obtain abortion services, however a network of pro-choice advocates is set up to assist you.  It is called the Overground Railroad, and the National Organization of Women http://www.NOW.org and the UU Churches are part of the network http://www.UUA.org.  Call and continue to ask for help, they will help you with transportation and lodging and will help you find funds to pay for a safe medical abortion.    It really would be best if you could talk with your Mom, however you know your situation.  Trust yourself.  Best wishes and take care. :)  |`|eTxh2So7aa	how does your weight have any relevance??|`|AA12020110	Talk to the people at Planned Parenthood.  Please.  Depending on your age, someone may have to tell your family.      You need some reliable counseling to make some very different decisions than the ones that got you here.  life is harder than we plan and then we make it worse by being impulsive.   Been there...started learning from my mistakes, but NOT soon enough. |`|fcxlJo0gaa	Because you are a ward of the court I believe this is an issue that needs to be discussed with your social worker. Depending on the circumstances, if your mom has lost full custody, her permission may not be needed. The next step for you is to go seek guidance at a planned parenthood- they can tell you exactly where to go from here.     Good luck. |`|puEjSoDfaa	I don't know what the law is in your state but in Ohio you have to be 18. BUT I when I had an abortion I went to my local court and got a judicial bypass. I talked to the judge and you have to prove that you are mature enough to make your own decision or that it's in your best interest. If you need help Planned Parenthood can give you all the information about it. |`|r3DPvVRuaa	you cant. you're a minor, there's no way of getting it w/o your legal guardian/parent. it is against the law and no state will do that. the only way you'd be able to get it is if you found some junkie selling them in the alley.... highly doubt that though.|`|TJlpUfq3aa	It depends on the laws in your state hunni.. some places consider you to be a legal adult once you become pregnant.. some states do not. && if you're really determined to have an abortion you will need to see a doctor to complete the process and for a check up afterwards.. idk how old you are but if you're not driving and able to pay for it yourself then you'll probably have to tell your parents anyway.. && if you cant get it without your parents permission, would you rather your mom know that your getting an abortion or that you're actually having a baby?? cuz if you cant get it w/o permission then in a few months you'll have a child.. its just something to consider and i wish you the best of luck regardless of how this turns out for you   |`|yThZy2gmaa	cami this is you why wouldnt you just tell me this was you on the phone

6orvPrLLaa	quite honestly, i think you're over qualified.    most only require that:  1) you normalize the dichotomy of "breeder/nurturer"  2) you have the capacity to price human babies based on a culture of racism  3) you have the ability to use "God" or "Jesus" in every answer to authenticate baby selling.  4) you are able to sleep at night knowing that your paycheck was derived from the wombs of scared young pregnant women.    --------------------------------------...|`|AA10494763	you need usually at least a BS in social work and your LSW   Licensed Social Worker|`|hzgFAJv0aa	I think it depends on what job you want to do for them and what kind of agency it is. Adoption is not a well regulated industry by any means and the requirements for employment will vary from agency to agency in the private sector depending on the job you want.    You won't need much to do several things such as secretarial work, fund-raising, recruiter :(, marketer :( etc.     Counselors in adoption agencies vary from professionals to "peer" counselors and it will depend on the agency what qualifications you would need.    Not all agencies require facilitators to be licensed social workers - I wouldn't advise being involved with one that doesn't though. If you want to work in foster care adoption (state/county agencies), R is correct, you will definitely need your MSW and LSW.    Agencies also employ attorneys (who handle their paperwork and protect them from unhappy clients), accountants (to handle all those "non-profit" fees) and some have "reunion specialists" (who decide who gets what info and sometimes reunite people).    There are even jobs for adoption lobbyists. There are lots of ways you can work for the adoption machine.       It all really depends on what you want to do and where you want to work. It would be nice if more people chose to work for the waiting adoptable children in foster care - but there isn't nearly as much $$$$$ in it.    Good luck. I hope you find something that suits you and really does help children and families.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Qualifications include:    Effective coersion techniques  Sales techinques  No compassion.    That ought to do it.|`|nESfk0bXaa	You should be someone who enjoys separating natural families while meeting your sales goals.|`|HmkCFddAaa	As you can see you won't get the answers you are looking for  from most of the people here. If this is what you want to do then I would suggest that you contact an agency and ask what their qualifications are, or talk to the guidance counselor at your school they can point you in the right direction|`|e5zOkZqIaa	Your question is way too general.    All adoption agencies are different, and all jobs are different.  Maybe you should try contacting an adoption case worker and seeing if they are willing to answer your questions.    Go to www.adoptuskids.com and in the children's profiles, it should say the name of their case worker to call or e-mail for questions.    If you e-mail them they may be more willing to answer your questions, because calling them about something like that might not work since they are very busy people.|`|XTgTs7Xuaa	Lucy da cat says one of the biggest requirements is you should like kool aid.    If you have experience running a lemonade stand, selling kool aid, drinking kool aid, making kool aid, etc you are a qualified candidate.|`|OjxJiorHaa	I am really not sure, I have wondered the same thing my self! You could possibly just start out as a receptionist at an agency to get your foot in the door!!!!  But I say GO FOR IT, I think it would be a wonderful job to help make families dreams come true.  Adoption is one of the most precious gifts, and to be a part of that would be in my book an incredible and amazing learning experience.  So don't listen to what others say, I don't think adoption in any way shape or form is selfish or unethical and I don't understand how people could ever think that! So good luck, my only suggestion is trying this web site, I have used it for many many resources as far as adoption goes my self, and you can find links to just about any thing! There are lists of job opening applications and all that, which will give you more detail on the qualifications!!      http://jobs.adoption.com/|`|2A6xFP81aa	I think you really just need to block out the fact that the greatest evil is separating mothers and babies, enjoy profiting on another's loss and sorrow. Maybe throw in an inflated sense of self-importance and the ability to kiss a$$$ till you get what you want from a vulnerable mother to be.

Como le explicaras a ese ni?o que no tiene un padre por que a ti no te importo la opinion de el y decidiste traerlo al mundo sola?

Todo ni?o(a) tiene el derecho de tener a su papa junto a el. Hay veces que esto no es posible, pero no se lo debes negar solo por tu egoismo. Y tal vez ese hombre al que no le quieres decir, podria ser un exelente padre y tu le estarias negando esa posibilidad.  Yo te aconsejo que lo pienses muy bien. Ser mama es una tarea muy dura. Tener un hombre junto a ti que te apoye, que te ayude y que los ame a ti y al bebe, seria lo ideal.   Si eres joven, tomate mas tiempo para encontrar a un hombre que te convenza para formar una familia.  Si ya no eres tan joven... yo buscaria a un hombre que pudiera ser un buen padre, aunque finalmente no pudieramos estar juntos como pareja, pero trataria de no negarle a mi hijo la posibilidad de tener un papa, aunque no viviera con el...|`|pjA5pv2baa	mm la decicion que quieres tomar es muy dificil, ya que cryar un hijo sola es muy dificil mas no imposible pero creo que deverias exponerle el caso a tu novio ya que que mejor si el te da un si como respuesta criar a su hijo los dos juntos y con mutuo acuerdo...mira desgraciadamente la sociedad es muy mala y criticadora, se que no es valido el que diran pero ponte a pensar mas delante en tu hijo(a) cuando este en la escuela y sea el dia del padre y el(ella) sin saber quien es, el dolor tan grande que le vaz a causar, las burlas de sus compa?eros porque acuerdate que hay ni?os muy feos y burlones, ponte analizar todo eso y si estas preparada para el reto adelante y recuerda que tienes que dejar toda tu vida para poder formar la de tu bebe y protegerlo de las demas personas y de los que diran, no bayas a traer a un angelito a sufrir mas de lo que ya se sufre en esta vida....    Cuidate mucho y piensa bien las cosas...    Suerte!!!!|`|e204ecb600078533c40cab2fd473cad6aa	ps la verdad he pensado q quiza yo en algun momento hga lo mismo, pero depende de la situacion en la q te encuentras, yo por ejemplo puedo estar embarazada de un hombre con el q no puedo estar nunca y ps la verdad no pienso decirle nada.

ZbP7vYAraa	Oi Lilly,   Isto n?o  leite, n?o querida.     Embora seja semelhante pela sua cor, que  um lquido esbranqui?ado, n?o  leite. Pois mesmo uma mulher grvida n?o produz leite no incio da gravidez.   Sente os seios inchados e muito sensveis, mas o leite mesmo apenas aparece de verdade aps o parto.     Vc pode estar com alguma infec??o. E por isto  que h esta excre??o que vc pensa ser "leite".   Procure um mdico ginecologista, para que ela possa fazer os exames e detectar esta infec??o, querida.

Como por exemplo enj?os,tonteiras,aumento da fome e peso,crescimento da barriga,seios mais volumosos e em alguns casos h produ??o de leite sim,pois seu sub consciente esta preparando seu corpo p/uma maternidade que ele tambm acredita ser real mesmo que vc mnstrue normalmente.Isso acontece as vezes porque a mulher tenha vontade de engravidar ou se senti culpada de alguma maneira,e at mesmo por medo de engravidar a tal ponto de desencadear um disturbio psicologico que vc e seu organismo acredite que esteja gravida.

KQFdvjMvaa	Eu usei a tcnica dada por um amigo meu que  geneticista. Ele fez um estudo no qual conseguiu quase 80% de sucesso.  o seguinte: Os espermatozides femininos s?o mais RESISTENTE, nequanto que os masculinos s?o mais RPIDOS. Para engravidar de menino, a mulher deveria manter rela??es somente A PARTIR DO DIA DA OVULA??O, se quisese engravidar de menina, manter rela??es somente AT O DIA DA OVULA??O. Funcionou para 80% das pacientes que participaram do estudo. Eu fiz isso, mas s saberei o resultado na semana que vem... Vou postar o meu resultado depois para vocs, fiquem de olho...  abra?os|`|7d9e44b31a2d275a65be71593e65fd52aa	Olha eu fiz e deu certo, segundo os especialistas dizem que se vc tranzar bem no dia da sua ovula??o h uma probabilidade maior de ser menino pq o esperma masc  mais rpido, agora se vc fizer antes h probabilidade de ser menina pois o esperma fem sobrevive mais tempo. Mais n?o  uma regra s aumenta as chances, bjo.|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Voc s pode engravidar de menino.|`|U0A7LBvqaa	Olha.. Parece que tem... Agora como, infelizmente n?o sei te dizer, mais  meio que simpatia...|`|63xpovYJaa	Dizem , que para engravidar de menina tem q ser apos ou antes do dia fertil, pois a menina e mais resistente, agora se quer menino  tem que ter rela?ao bem no dia exato da ovula?ao, pois o menino e mais rapido e menos resitente....  Acho que e isso.......  Espero que eu nao tenha me confundido..  Um abra?o.|`|gQtxo1mNaa	O espermatozide masculino  mais rpido porm mais frgil, o feminino  mais lentoporm mais forte.  Para menino tenha rela??o no dia exato do perodo frtil e na semana anterior uma alimenta??o saudavel sem muitos carboidratos o que far o ph da vagina ficar menos cido.  Para menina, tenha dois dias antes ou se for no dia, fa?a uma lavagem intima( Para uma litro de gua 1 colher de vinagre), tenha uma alimenta??o com muito carboidrato, o que far o ph da sua vagina ficar mais cido e enfraquecer o esperma masculino.BJUS. Boa sorte!|`|9c6e64babf60c36f5e51ec46639b26a5aa	Olha aprendi uma coisa com uma professora de quimica e que deu certo para um amiga minha.    A mulher s pode ter bebes MENINA, e  o homem que determina se va ser MENINO OU MENINA. Por que ele tem o X e o Y e a mulher s o X.    Se juntar XX ser menina, Se juntar XY ser menino.    O espermatozoite "masculino" o Y,  mais rpido e morre mais cedo dentro da mulher. Ent?o se vc ja esta ovulando com certeza ele vai chegar antes e vai ser um Menino, agora se vc ainda vai ovular o espematozoide "feminino" o X, que  mais lento mas dura mais tempo dentro da mulher tem mais chance de fertilizar o ovulo.    Tem a questao da comida tb, as comidas mais acidas matam os espermatozoides machos...     Bjs...

PwgoftwIaa	My daughter has silent reflux and we've had her on prevacid for months and it has helped a lot. It did take a week or so to actually kick in and I've read it can take longer with some babies. Depending on how long he's been on both you may want to ask the pediatrician if Zantac may be better for him, the only thing I know about Zantac is that they have to take it 3 times daily and the taste isn't as good as Prevacid.    I'm not sure why they have him on Prevacid and Axid, from what I read they're the same type of medicine. My daughter would take 1 prevacid solutab in the morning till she was around 4 months, now we cut it in half and she takes a dose in the morning and 1 before bed. If she has any problems throughout the day the pediatrician said I could give her a little Maalox. I would question why they have him on 2 different PPI's.|`|gLoVlRkKaa	every baby is different...so different things work.my girl is on prilosec every 12 hours and it helps her. we thought she outgrew it so she was off it for over a month. she just turned 5 months and was hurting again so the doc put her back on it and shes doing better. make sure you as the pediatrcian and when something doesnt seem to work as to try another.my pedi had us give her a ltle bit of maalox til the prilosec worked... every doc and every baby is different....|`|4xTDmLjHaa	Don't put your baby on anything that isn't approved by your doctor. Check with him/her first.    Its also important to realize that the majority of babies have reflux, so meds may not work. I didn't want to medicate my daughter, since reflux is so common, and she outgrew it around 5 1/2 months.|`|MPBIh9nhaa	my 19 week old is on zantac and i think it works great.|`|VzvDMvJmaa	i would  definatley  go with zantac   i think its half a ml  or a whole ml twice a day   the only downside is they only have peppermint flavor so some kids dont like it or wont take it  my child took it and it was less medicine than prevacid but worked better lol
c74d6b9878d07360e2103b873e1d5ad4aa	i got this from happiest baby on the block, so you might want to check it out. he says to let the baby nap during the day but to make them wake up after an hour or two. make sure to keep them active during the day and keep a routine of night time events, like feeding then a bath then a story then bed. he said lighting is important too. we havent had our baby yet but, ive had alot of people recommend the book. good luck|`|gLoVlRkKaa	along with whatever it is you decide to do... during the day open the blinds turn on lights to show its day.. dim everything and where baby sleeps put the lights down to a dim night light.. my pediatrician told me that and they eventually get.. worked for us... also several statistics say that trying to keep them awake during the day only makes them cranky and doesnt make a difference. the night and day thing along with your routine helps them connect day with play and night with sleep..hope i helped|`|7c6c1d259ba896ea5802761f502a9f65aa	I've had two kids and found that at first they have days and nights mixed up. I suggest that you try to "play" more with the baby during the day. Talk to him/her while feeding and after feeding. Use ur baby voice to keep their interest as well as rattles. At first it will take some time but slowly they will come around. During night time feedings make sure you kind of disconnect yourself. Don't play and talk to the baby too much. And lay em back down right away. Don't worry if the baby cries. They aren't hungry they just want to "play" Worked for both my kids. My daughter is two months old and started sleeping thru the night at about 1 month :o)|`|AA11758235	depends on how old baby is.  A regular 'bedtime routine' helps a lot.  make sure baby is awake for awhile before bedtime.  Sometimes this takes some stimulation.    A bath before bed helps, and make sure you don't put the child to bed hungry-hungry baby cannot sleep!    It helped with mine to warm the babies bed before you put him down-going from mom's warm arms to a cold bed can be quite shocking!|`|KkWEmeMEaa	As a newborn I would talk more to her in the day and promote keeping her awake as much as possible. At night, I would make sure there was no 'up time' after feedings and keep the lights really dimmed. In her crib in the day I would make sure the curtains were not drawn so she could start to diferencitate night/day. By 2 1/2 months she was sleeping at 5 hour stretches and when getting up for the 'early morning feeding' would stretch right back to sleep...good luck and keep practicing..

O teste vai detectar no sangue um horm?nio que, s e somente s, existe na corrente sangunea de mulheres que foram fecundadas. Esse horm?nio come?a a ser fabricado imediatamente aps a fecunda??o do vulo, portanto, se o exame acusa a existncia do horm?nio, mesmo em pouca quantidade, ou seja se o resultado  positivo, significa que a pessoa est grvida. Geralmente o resultado sai no mesmo dia. O exame de sangue  a melhor forma  de saber rapidamente e com seguran?a se a pessoa est ou n?o grvida. Boa sorte!

O que vocs devem ter em mente  que para que essas plulas atinjam margens satisfatrias de eficcia deve-se tom-las por pelo menos um ms (o mais recomendado  trs meses) antes de ter rela??es sexuais sem preservativo. De qualquer maneira, essas plulas n?o s?o 100% e seus horrios devem ser seguidos RIGOROSAMENTE, porque um dos fatores que mais reduz a eficcia  o n?o-cumprimento do horrio. O mais recomendado  a combina??o camisinha e plula. Outra coisa,  que para saber a melhor plula a se tomar, deve-se procurar o atendimento especializado, Ginecologista, porque  cada plula  diferente e possuem, portanto, dosagem diferenciada, variando de mulher para mulher. Ou seja, a mulher deve procurar saber qual tipo  mais indicado. Para se ter rea??es sexuais sem preservativo e sem coito interrompido com o mximo de seguran?a possvel, o tempo indicado  o da menstrua??o. Todavia, aten??o! O perodo aps o trmino da menstrua??o j n?o  seguro. Para saber se a garota em quest?o est grvida, o mtodo verdadeiramente confivel  o exame sanguneo, Beta HCG.

Segundo especialistas  a melhor solu??o quando a m?e realmente n?o tem condi??es financeiras para criar. Pois isto impede que seja abandonado para uma ado??o que pode n?o sair e crian?as com mais idade geralmente n?o s?o adotas. Isso quando n?o s?o largadas no mundo e na marginalidade.

xgv5brW3aa	Wow, I can't believe all of the people who feel the right to tell you what to do with your own body! Children of teenage mothers are more likely to live and poverty and have dozens of other problems. I respect your decision to wait to have children until you are ready. It's more responsible than the people who raise a child they had to young on welfare. The average price of an abortion in 2001 was $487. Your best bet would probably be to consult Planned Parenthood. Thank you for your responsibility.|`|puEjSoDfaa	$250-600. Good luck. I know how you feel. I went through the exact same thing, everything will turn out okay!|`|RlHBk9iMaa	People had the right to by slaves once in this country too.  That use to be legal.  Go to Birth Right, they'll help.|`|U56OqFe2aa	Please be responsible and get on the pill after this is all said and done. Planned Parenthood can help you with both.|`|4B57rvGCaa	it doesnt cost much about 250 try the womens clinics they can help you with it we had one done for 200|`|Foi6PFWQaa	It doesn't matter weather or not you have the abortion , you will still be a mother...the only difference between you and other mothers is that your baby is dead and it's your fault. You should have thought about the consequences before you had sex.  If you are old enough and mature enough to have sex you are old enough and mature enough to have a baby, you two are both just being selfish. But sense you assured me you were going to MURDER it no matter what I say they are around $300 to $500...I'm going to pray you can't afford it.|`|kDdadHukaa	dont get one  put the child up for adoption after you have it|`|8ddb7a13bfc50d6825c6a6f035345b83aa	I'm not sure how much it costs exactly money wise. But i do know that it costs a life. Sorry, i know thats not what you wanna hear...but in my opinion its legal murder.|`|JeV7MPXCaa	Don't kill your child. You'll regret it later, because, it will haunt you that you killed an unborn baby. Take full responsibility for your actions. And next time don't use a walmart brand condom.  :)|`|rzEK4ANmaa	ABORTION IS MURDER!!!! |`|gwUMipsUaa	You may have the right, but have you thought about all the ramifications?    My friend had an abortion, because her boyfriend at the time told her he'd leave her if she didn't, so she did.  He dumped her anyway.  It's several years later now and she still feels guilty.  The child would be 15 now.  She looks at her two now, and knows there should be another child in between them(she had one son already).    If you are dead set on having an abortion, it'll cost a couple hundred, and that's only the monetary cost.    Best advice is no matter what you do, don't be having sex again until you are ready to have a(nother) baby.    Look into adoption and be a blessing for a stable, married couple who can't have one of their own.  You'll be glad you did.|`|pgiGhD6Daa	People have the right to be pro-life, but I wish that they would not be so nieve as to suggest adotion in leu of abortion. Most of the women who place for adoption have serious regrets. Check on the adoption forums if you don't believe me. Look under my previous questions and click sone of the links on the answers. My freind was only 23 and she needed open heart surgery after she had her baby. Dr's are not psychics. the solution of "only if the mothers life is at risk" is impractical. A dr cannot tell you what will happen to you during delivery. 20%of women need blood transfusions during and after delivery. HOWEVER if your boyfrind is good to you, even if ya'll don't get married, at least yall can still be friends and raise the child. Youth is not necessarily to your disadvantage. Consider: Your child will be 15 when you are 32. You sill still be young enough to do the things that people have you convinced you will miss now. You also have the energy and your body will bounce back faster. IF YOU WANT THE BABY DO NOT LET FEAR MAKE YOUR DECISION.    do a google search for your area. Under 12 weeks runs between $400 and $700 in LA. You can get one as late as 24 weeks but that is $3,000. If you go early enough you can just take pills up to 8 weeks. I would prefer this method as I have heard many women become sterile after an abortion. But then I have met many who didn't. Ask around about the clinic. I wanted an abortion, but did not get one. The father has realised how expensive a child will be and has told me not to contact him anymore. NO ONE HAS TO LIVE YOUR LIFE BUT YOU. Good luck in your decision, and be thankful that your man is behind you, if this is indeed what YOU want.|`|8D6IbrcTaa	It might not change your mind but i costs an innocent life|`|SYBfPFcDaa	Glad you're doing what's best for YOU TWO.  I guess it doesn't matter about what's best for that innocent life you created when you opened your damn legs.  Aww, you're scared? Diddums. I was scared, but I still faced up to my responsibility.  But, yeah, I guess it would be a huge hassle to just wait a few more months and give the baby up for adoption. Good job your mum didn't think the same when she was pregnant with you isn't it, otherwise there'd have been one less foetus murderer in the world, and wouldn't that be a shame.  Enjoy doing what's best for YOU.
501e0e95642a28c15746b2bf96c44052aa	Erica, because people are scared to change and open their minds.  Thank you and good day.|`|ZEO7RhGzaa	Because people don't know their facts.    A lot of those people who think it's bad, smoke cigarettes.  Apparently they don't realize how much worse cigarettes are than marijuana.    And they think every person who smokes pot will become an addicted burn out.  I know plenty of people who are successful and have smoked weed.  I refuse to believe it's addicting.  It's more of a mental addiction because people want to make themselves feel better about it.  It's not possible to be physically addicted to it.|`|AA11542772	idk besides its health risks its not that bad look at how cigaretts and alcohol harm the body some of it is definetly worse then weed not saying that i do it or anything but seriously it should be up to the person to decide if they want to do it haha|`|nwZ1ZtRbaa	It can cause people to do stupid things(notice how I said can). I personally don't judge people who do drugs, unless they do dumb things that could harm people while under the influence of them. Nobody's perfect, I'm sure there's things about me that someone who smokes weed wouldn't approve of. |`|puEjSoDfaa	People are ignorant about it and refuse to change their minds about anything. I smoke weed and get bitched at all the time about it, like its so horrible, I don't think you can get addicted physically to it, I do it to focus or just to calm down because I get stressed out and have anxiety. people just don't understand...
b71BxLUZaa	My 20 month old has a sippy of 2% milk for breakfast and sometimes at night for a snack. She asks for milk sometimes throughout the day too.    She really likes yougurt, too so she eats a lot of yogurt; usually about a container a day. (She likes YoBaby.)|`|A89ezcg5aa	My daughter is 13 months and she has about 2 cups of milk daily.  I give her yogurt when I remember to buy it.|`|5TvyhgP6aa	About 16 oz. of milk.  She also eats cheese and yogurt on some days.  She's 15 months|`|5EiShLZZaa	My doctor recommended no more than 24 ounces of whole milk daily,my little guy loves milk and drinks his 24 ounces.  He usually has a cheese stick for a snack (loves colby jack) or some yogurt...that's about it!|`|DYJOpfvraa	My 16 month old daughter drinks 3 cups of whole milk a day. Each cup is about 9 oz. Most of the time she finishes it all, however, there's times when she only drinks half of a cup in a sitting.  At 12 months she wasn't drinking 8 oz since she didn't really like whole milk but thankfully she gradually started liking it.    As far as how much dairy she was taking at 12 months? I'd say it was about less than 1/2 a cup of milk but I was giving her yogurt and cheese. Not sure exactly.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	Our son has about 16oz of milk a day.  Plus a little cheese or yoghurt (about 3 tablespoons).
NWEJdpocaa	Isla is one of my favorite names, it was my aunts name and I always thought it was beautiful. Quinn is a middle name I'm not used to hearing so that's nice.    I'm not a big fan of Anais but I love the spelling of Elisabeth, it's softer!    Violet Amelia is very cute, kinda sounds like a doll.    Audrey is pretty but I don't particularly like Lea.    Lilliana April is a cute name.    Eden Sophia is very pretty, but Eden kind of reminds me of eat-in, like eat-in kitchen.    Lena Adele is classy sounding.    Simon Alexander is a very strong name, I like it a lot.    Seth is great, Ezekiel is a little too much for me.    Holden James, I'm glad to see someone else likes the name Holden.    Eli Parker is a little cutesy for a boy, but still I don't dislike it.    Noam isn't a favorite of mine but I love Elliot for a middle name.    Leander again isn't my type of name, but Nathan is nice.    Jude Olivier is very neat, I like this one a lot.    Oliver Daniel is nice too.    Overall, I like most of your names, they are all very classy and elegant...good luck :)|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Eden Sophia  Seth Ezekial  Holden James  Eli Parker  Jude Olivier    Are my favorites.|`|62vCoDPjaa	audrey lea and lilliana april are cute    not much for any of the boy names|`|9lvybFqNaa	If I can mix them, My favorites are:    Eden Quinn  Quinn Adele  Leander Seth  Seth Elliot  Elliot Jude    = )|`|QreA4abxaa	i love...  isla quinn, eden sophia, and lena adele    i love...  holden james|`|ej51eWO7aa	Violet Amelia & Simon Alexander|`|50c6a30e3a0dd958fb1a8658f3199941aa	I love almost all of them!!!|`|NCl7B7diaa	I love Isla for a girl, it's so pretty!!! 10  and Seth for a boy|`|4a1901d0c86849c396ed8c70a9ac9794aa	they are different from the names I have heard from others but they are special in their own way (that's to say I like them they're good), could I suggest one Parker James, it's actually a combo. of two of your listed names Holden James and Eli Parker|`|uOVepBl8aa	My fave. girl name is Violet Amelia...or maybe Lena Adele...they both get a 10/10!

Oliver Daniel- Two first names!|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	Isla Quinn - Isla is pretty but I worry about pronunciation in the U.S. (if you are in the U.S.). Quinn is a boy name.   Anais Elisabeth - okay but the flow is off.   Violet Amelia - nice but Violet is so celeb-trendy  Audrey Lea - I like Audrey but I don't get Lea. It doesn't make sense phonetically to me and I don't like the sound.   Lilliana April - I'm not a fan of misspelled names or names that end in -ana (they feel tacky to me), so Lilliana does nothing for me. I'm not a fan of April. Its outdated.   Eden Sophia - eh, I'm not a fan of Eden. Its not bad, I just don't find it feminine or pretty. I love Sophia although its way overused right now.   Lena Adele - I don't like the pronunciation you are using for Lena. I like it better as Lee-nuh. I love Adele!    Simon Alexander - very handsome !  Seth Ezekiel - eh, I'm not a fan of either name and I don't think they go well together at all.   Holden James - I don't like Holden. All I can hear or see is holding or holdin'. James is boring as a middle name.   Eli Parker - I love Eli but Parker is so trendy.   Noam Elliot - okay. I'm not a fan of Noam but its not bad. Elliot is nice .  Leander Nathan - very mismatched. I'm not a fan of either name either.   Jude Olivier - I love this!

77NzfiVkaa	If it was something that the school just organized themselves without a bunch of paperwork I would say do it but with all that paperwork it is most likely not worth it. My school had something similar to that and it was really a waste of time and I never really got to know my mentor at all.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Why not leave it up to your kids? It's really important for your kids to have a say. It shouldn't matter if they aren't hanging out after the first 3 weeks because by then they're acclimated to school. The mentor is to get them through the beginning. Why not have your kids fill out the paperwork themselves and then just check it over?     If your kids are laid back and make friends really easily (outside of each other and each others' friends), then maybe those kids do not need a mentor. If your kids are more nervous about it and more apt to be shy and reserved, then a mentor may be beneficial. You could have one or two or three with a mentor and the other(s) without.     Why not talk to them and gauge their readiness for high school and go from there?|`|x9cM3hJiaa	i know when i entered high school i had a mentor, and it wasn't very helpful for me cause i had an older sister who was a senior, but for my friends who didnt have an older sibling it was good for them cause they had a new network of friends and someone to say hey to in the hallway that was older so they felt good and everything. so i say do it, it cant hurt. and you have four kids entering the same grade?! God bless you!|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	don't do it CZ they just find out stuff and gossip.|`|OLF7TUXBaa	hi i'm a senior mentor. i mentor little kids, though, but maybe i can still help. i love being a mentor b/c i want to be a teacher. i know some people only take the class b/c its easy and don't really care a whole lot. others care a lot.i enjoy helping them with their class work and giving them advice. it really feels good to make a difference in a person's life and its truly something that the child will remember forever, or so i've been told. it changes you and makes you see what your teachers have to deal with. i would do it.|`|5070437d89b5a5c0baa621683e5f89f9aa	We have a similar program in our school called "Peer Leadership".   Let me tell you - these kids are no "leaders" by any stretch of the imagination.  Only in the sense that they're doing the "right" thing to please parents and look good on college applications.  (Hope I don't sound too negative.)   13 compared with 17/18 - yep they learn alot - but not necessarily what you'd want them to learn  My suggestion: if you have family friends or neighbor (our older cousins) who have older kids that you truly know and admire, that' s a better deal.  You can also touch base with the older teen and find out if there's anything you need to know (issues of concern). You might also consider your youth group leadership, if you attend a local church that has a ministry to high schoolers.|`|Sy2BhXGlaa	don't do it, the upperclassmen will completely **** with the freshmen|`|UQrd65q2aa	i personally am a junior in high school. at our high school we have a program called link leaders. these are select people to mentor the freshman. we have 2 training days in the summer and have the one day with our groups. However, our school sounds a little different than yours. As a leader once a month we get together with our groups while they are freshman to check in and see how every things going. As for peoples responses about the upper class man with mess with the freshman. at least at our school that doesn't happen. we applied for this position as a leader and we just do what we are told to do. I think its great for your child to do a program like this because it makes them feel comfortable and know there is an upperclassman available if they need help. It wont be so intimidating. Finally it also might help with them becoming more familiar with the school. I hope this helps and good luck to your child!

If you mean the plastibell you should just leave it be. My son's looked red for awhile and it eventually went away. The nurse told us to leave it alone and only to worry if the bell slipped down lower, it started bleeding or it was pussy. His fell off 10 days after he had it done, he was in the bath at the time. Try looking up plastibell in google. I got some great websites that made me feel better.|`|acj9mB9Paa	we used baby wipes and after every diaper change we also put pain relieving Neoprene.  It worked very well for us and the plasti-bell fell off at about eight days.|`|vB9VlHHkaa	woah, alcohol? no no NO! just a little soap and water (antibacterial) is all i used and it healed just fine. never pull at the wrapping, let it fall off itself. alcohol is sure to burn. cut your skin open and pour alcohol in it. bet it hurts like crazy. i do not recommend that at all. good luck|`|808228039376c85932e905c16a8dbff0aa	You could try using a ball of cotton wool dipped in water, and just wiping the required area as needed, as i doubt you're allowed to get 'it' soaking wet with the ring on. Since the area is sensitive, the alcohol may sting him.  On my nephew, the above is how we used to do it, but it may not only be limited to that method; Its up to you really.    and yeah the O-ring will hurt the baby, but don't worry too much about it; as it's usually a sign that the O-ring is slowly coming off with time (as it should).     When you do your baby's nappy, check the situation of the ring. Depending on how long your he's has had the ring on, it'll either be 1 of 3 stages:  1) It'll be fully on (in which case you should not fiddle with it too much),  2) It'll be partly off/ unstuck (in which case u should try to put it back 'On', and in its original position), otherwise theres a chance that it could twist and turn into an uncomfortable position an get caught in the nappy and tug/rip off the skin when the baby moves about,  3) It'll either be fully off, which is great (for your baby of course^^).    Usually as the days go on, and the ring starts to unstick more and more, you will notice that your baby may cry more and more too. Sometimes it may be normal at that stage, but sometimes you may have to check the O-ring and put it back on if it has been dislodged or started to come off.    Other than that, i guess all you could do is pray that it comes off quickly without causing the baby too much discomfort.    All the best!
aJLx0nhNaa	I wouldn't do it to a baby or a little kid who didn't really understand it or know what was going on.  As body modifications go, ear piercing is pretty minor, but still.  I mean, I didn't circumcise my son, I'm certainly not going to ear pierce a daughter.    Anyway, I remember when my mom finally agreed that I could have my ears pierced after I begged and took me to do it.  It was awesome, it was a as a reward for something or other.  Why not save it until then?|`|b71BxLUZaa	I don't mind it. I wouldn't pierce a BABY'S ears though. I'd rather wait until my child was at least three.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	i personally didnt piece my daughters because what if she got like 5 and hates them ? i figure when she asks then she can . but i am not going to make her at 1 month old . but thats me other people do it and theres no problem with it|`|256cVXsmaa	Lol weird I was just contemplating whether or not I was going to get my baby's ears pierced or not.  I decided it probably best to wait until they begged for it.  Plus it's an experience/memory they won't forget if it's something they REALLY want!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	It's really not a big deal to me but my husband and I got our daughter's done when she was 3 months old. She never had a problem with them. I know I'll probably get thumbs down from people who disagree but I have no problem with parents who wait for the child to decide, why have a problem with my choice.|`|SIhEme03aa	I think people should wait until the child asks to have their ears pierced. I personally didn't have my ears pierced until I was 20! I just never really wanted to.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i would do it as soon as possible. al little girls want their ears pierced. may as well do it when they are going to forget the pain.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Relax! If the baby is a girl why not? Its just one little piercing that she will have forever girls usually like to wear earing so why not? I pierced my daughter ears when she was little and she loves them now.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I don't think it's a good idea, I wouldn't do it if I had a baby. I think it should be their individual choice. For a lot of girls, choosing to get it done or going with friends or family members is an exciting time. I also think it looks a bit tacky and odd on a baby. Plus there is the risk of the baby pulling on it or infection - I know somebody who was left with bad scarring because of this and the holes wouldn't close.    I also can't stand it when people say "all little girls want earrings" and other rubbish - not true! They can't speak for everybody. I've never had my ears pierced and never wanted to. I have two friends who didn't get it done until age 16, when they made the choice, and several other friends who aren't pierced at all.    Harriet|`|cDVAEHgCaa	It's not for me, but if other parents want to do it, it's their right.|`|xbFhE5Tkaa	I got mine when i was 2, do it then.|`|rjVALevtaa	I agree with you. If I had a daughter I wouldn't pierce her ears until she was old enough to tell me that that is what she wanted.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I waited until my older daughter was about 6 months. I'm going to do the same with my baby now. I think birth is too young since they can get an infection and medication might be dangerous for them. Also, I think its better to get it when they are babies because once they get older, they want it but they are too scared. And btw I would never ear gauge my baby. Good luck!|`|p6AMoTs8aa	its normal everyone does it|`|A7cZtZFyaa	I personally want to wait until my daughter is old enough to ask me to get her ears pierced.  I got my ears pierced when I was in 5th grade for my birthday. I have the memory of going with my mom and I was so excited.  I hope to do the same with Julia someday.|`|eth48m7Iaa	I agree with you. Let her decide when shes older. I had mine pierced when i was 7 so I thought I would offer it to my daughter when she turns 7.|`|RYmkmyuvaa	I say no just because they could grab at their ears and pull them out!  I would be afraid that my baby would ingest them.  Not for my baby!  Or at least until she was school aged.|`|wcdz3lIPaa	I don't think it's a big deal. I had mine done when I was 10 months old.|`|q51cevqLaa	I am not really for it.  My mom had mine done when I was 3.  I think it is a personal preference.  If I had a daughter, I would wait.  The piercing isn't so bad, but when kids are young, they always seem to get infected and are difficult to take care of.  I say wait until they are older and can take some of the responsibility for caring for them.|`|VfTMkFaDaa	There is nothing harm in piercing the babies year. In fact it shud be done when they are small as the ear lobes are soft and tender and they dont feel a thing. It hurts once the ear lobes get thick.. All woman love wearing earrings and it would be very sad if their ears were not pierced when they were babies cause later it would really hurt! m sure u wont want ur daughter cursing u for that later on :)|`|mzXnweedaa	It's basically normal i had mines periced when i was little|`|vB9VlHHkaa	i worked beside a ear piercing booth at the mall several years ago and i hated to hear the babies scream. i ended up quiting because i couldn't take it. i think it is unnecessary to put a baby through such pain. what would happen to them if they got infected? it causes fevers and everything else. i hate the whole idea. i am waiting until my daughter is old enough to take care of the herself. it also teaches them responsibility.|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	I am getting my daughters ears peirced as soon as they will do it i got mine peirced at 5 weeks and how would they know they don't want it? if it is all they know besides my sister didn't like hers and chose not to wear earings and that was her choice so even if you get her ears peirced now it can go the other way around and she can just as easily choose not to wear earings|`|lj4LgYvGaa	I disagree with the ppl who say every girl/woman likes wearing earrings. how do you know? have you asked every woman in the world? I know a few young women who don't like the idea of their ears being pierced, so there you go, some do and some don't, and how are you going to know if your child does want it if they don't realise what it is that's happening? they cant say, no i don't want it, or yes, i do. i think its taking away a part of their free will, cause you do this to them, they don't even realise there were 2 options and if they don't want them when they're older, they'll have scars in their ears, if the holes ever do end up closing.|`|tMxGi4hPaa	I'm waiting until my daughter is old enough to ask. That's her decision, not mine.|`|IkkYOehSaa	it depends on each person. I didn't do it with my oldest daughter until she was 6 because she used to grab her hers when she was tired. And i never thought about it with my now 10 month old and it's a little too late for her until she's older. But my friend had her 2 1/2 month old daughters ears pierced about 2 weeks ago and it has worked very well for her.
w2WFDunnaa	okay well first off why are you taking pics off of Other people's photo bucket accounts. if you don't have their permission you can get into trouble JUST TRYING TO WARN YOU.    Secondly try right clicking and saving the photos that you're using then uploading them onto your account. then after that make your photo bucket account private. so when people do click on the pic it will only let them see that image and it's code that's all.    But if you want to make it simple and clean then just do this.  go back to the photobucket account were you got the photo from  and copy the direct link then paste this code were you want the photo to go on your profile  then when you have got the direct link erase IMAGE TEXT and replace it with the direct link!    then you're done your picture are no longer clickable!|`|ArfWE1Ykaa	put your photobucket on private.    click account options at the top then scroll down to album settings and change public to private.|`|MeED6WtFaa	haha, so easy, first when you copy and paste an image's code, it comes with " remove it and there ya go|`|WGAFP6mSaa	Ditto to the first answer.
9b9c4dc669c29b1293318c04993f2a7daa	Actually, Artemis means "Gift of the Gods" at least that's what my source said (could be wrong).    Anyway, I really love that name. May be a bit butch but there's definately great ring to it, and a wonderful story behind the name.|`|DP48dIxhaa	I don't like either. I guess if I had 2 pick I would pick Artemis.|`|mtmGvlTAaa	Artimis    because im not gonna name my child seven.  i might use the name Sinco thoughh|`|qgRibLytaa	greek fer ser there both really pretty though(:|`|760d2895bd058b74a7e6023ceaf0ed2aaa	Artemis :)|`|Sy2BhXGlaa	greek mother ******|`|1ci89Hwhaa	Artemis sounds sooooo much better!!!!!|`|fb1K9Jlwaa	Either way the kid is going to get teased. I think both names sound awful.|`|aDXD9Appaa	they both are pretty horrible if you ask me. do you want them to get beat up?|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	I really don't like either, sorry.|`|k21EzRIbaa	They're both bad.   Artemis is way too masculine and Septima just sounds gross.|`|fW1G8ep5aa	I'd go with Artemis.  Artemis has some kind of mystery and intrigue about it.  Septima is nice, but it seems too straight forward.  Unless you have some reason for liking the number 7, I think that Artemis can have so many more interpretations.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I think I would rather have a name meaning safe instead of seventh|`|IggGQ4GEaa	artemis|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	artemis is way better      septima reminds me of sperminator|`|ej51eWO7aa	Septima|`|CxRJwJsraa	Honestly I like both, though they are both a pretty bold choice.    I think I Septima slightly more. not sure why...just do.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	I prefer Artemis!|`|4npjIcPaaa	artemis. personally if you are going into greek gods i like athena|`|AA11269060	Septima.  Artemis sounds male.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	neither|`|40whdSDYaa	uhhh idk which one,...just make sure dat ur kid watches out for bullies wen she is older|`|714af23aaae71e5eebdb479c36d6cd86aa	Septima sounds like what u would name a car    hey....I  just bought  a brand new Septima....40km to the gallon !    LOL    I don't like any to be honest.
Th3bifTWaa	Sibyll sounds like someone forgot a few syllables for the word "syllable" .. heh heh .  no offense.    I like Ariana much better [that's actually the name of a character in my story!]     But spelled  Arianna; it's so much prettier .   :)|`|hGKZsfg8aa	Arianna  (:|`|tyqN6qBUaa	I like Sibyl with one 'l', but if we're picking from only your choices, Ariana.|`|b4UCzrDeaa	Ariana!!|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	Ariana!!!!!!|`|NCl7B7diaa	Ariana is a really pretty name|`|kHLwlNA5aa	They are both pretty names, but I'd go with Ariana (in Italian it means song).

uoNgB7Kmaa	There is a genetic connection. Just because alcoholism is in the genes doesn't mean the kid WILL be an alcoholic. It just means that the tendency would be there. So in other words, they would have a better chance at becoming an alcoholic than a person who didn't have the genetic predisposition.|`|AA12074512	yes.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	both of my parents a alcolics ... i never got into drinking too much ..|`|JGpirCtLaa	I don't think it's like in the genes.  But if he is an alcoholic around the kid, then the kid has a greater chance.  But since he's not anymore, your kid should be fine!|`|VUss5AfAaa	i herd that if it comes from his family side and himself..its possible your baby will be in the future as well.    cant really say what are the chances but 50/50  i guess.  my mom is an alcoholic and im one of those that dosnt really like to drink much..im more of a wine drinker. never been drunk or passed out.  i drink to have fun not to get drunk.    in my hubbys side he has 2 uncles that died from trauma they were alcoholics...one was 40 and the other was 26 ...sad tragedy but its life.|`|481fb39f3d176bea4494d67c5edc1aa5aa	alcoholism can be passed down in the sense that it is an addiction and the 'addiction gene' can be passed down.  that only means the child has a greater chance of becoming an alcoholic if they drink.  but if they never start drinking they can never be an alcoholic. I read somewhere that 10% of people who drink will become alcoholics anyway.  not sure what the percentage is for people whose parents are alcoholics?|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Yes, your baby will have a greater chance of being an alcoholic but that doesn't mean he/she will be.  Alcoholism runs in families.  My ex's mom was a drug addict and his dad was an alcoholic and he became both.  However, my husband's dad is a drug addict and alcoholic and he is just fine.  It depends on the person, but it does run in families.
RPszYGXkaa	Anytime prior to ovulation (usually the few days before and maybe the day after the "O") if you have creamy, watery, slippery or egg white like cervical fluid, it is considered fertile.  Once ovulation happens, then your fluid dries up for the most part.  Sometimes you get the egg white, slippery fluid toward the end of your cycle when your period is starting, at that time it isn't considered fertile fluid.
AA11885437	Save yourself the stress and take the cup away the first time she empties it. You get to stay calm and she will learn pretty darn quick that if she does that she looses it. She doenst get a reaction from you and she looses her drink. It makes the "game" not so fun  pretty fast. That said, there are going to be times you loose your cool. Just try to breathe and if you can safely step away for a few seconds to catch your breath , do so. I really dont think they mean to be "naughty" this young. Its like a big game to them and they are just figuring out the way things work. Use that to your advantage to show them exactly how things work...for example, if they throw food, meal time is over. No yelling is needed, just a oh, you are all done and remove the food. My 15 month old likes to throw the dog kibble out of the bowl. Every time she does, she had to sit in the play pen while I clean it up. She hates waiting there while I pick up the mess, and so after a (long) while it finally clicked and she has been throwing the dog food much much less. Some things I just remove the temptation...she would always want to play with the plug in air freshener so I just took it out for now. Problem solved. Pick your battles. Control what you can and teach discipline where you need to. Its a tough job being a mom and sometimes toddlers can be so frustrating! Its a good thing their cute :) Good Luck!|`|QBt5LmxVaa	you have to remember that he is a kid, and ev eryone acted out at that age :) good luck|`|4CMQuJgOaa	I have learned that when I feel that way I have to walk away.     My son is 2 1/2 and does the same thing with dumping drinks on the floor, carpet and I have even caught him dumping in on the dog..then saying he was giving him a bath!     I walk away for a few minutes. Take a few deep breaths then go and talk to him. You are correct she was testing you. My son started the "terrible twos at about 16maths" and we are still there LOL    Be patient and consistent. It will get better    Edit: When I go back to talk to him I kneel down to his level and make him look at me...explain mommy is not happy we do not pour our drinks on the floor then sit him in time out for 2mins (1min per year of age)|`|6Sdg2k3waa	Take the cup away next. If she isn't going to use it right then she doesn't get it at all. She was testing to see how much she could push up before you would react differently. Kids this age test the limits all the time to see what is right and what is wrong. Stay consistent and calm and you will have better results in the future. I sometimes give myself a time out if I can't stay clam with my daughter so I don't do something that I will regret later. I often will call someone to talk myself out of it or vent. Usually I call my mom and she reminds me of all the stuff I did and that makes me feel a little better. Or a friend who has a child the same age and I am reminded that I'm not the only one going through it. :)|`|WdVjF1Ihaa	It's hard to stay in control sometimes ~ but we as adults HAVE to!  :)    Try some of these tips:    * When you're angry, stop, calm down and slowly count to 10 (or 20 as I have.)  * Work out stress by exercising. Exercise releases endorphins, which are neurotransmitters that produce positive feelings.  * Give yourself some time alone. If someone else is available to watch the children, take advantage of it.  * Transfer negative energy into positive energy. Do something productive like clean the house or work in the yard.  * Share your feelings. Write them in a journal, share them with a friend or call a confidential help line. Just releasing those feelings can make you feel better.  * Tune yourself out. Listen to music, watch TV or read a book until you feel that you can rationally deal with the problem.

Hang in there!?|`|nfWIhyZsaa	it is ok to loose temper once in a while. dont feel guilty about it. its the kids usual way, to test the limits of their parents and their careers. kids do carry out such tests to make sure, whether certain things are said 'no' under any circumstances, or whether it would change with the circumstances. they are just learning, whether,they would be permitted to do certain naughty things, if they are repeated.                       a firm 'NO' would be good enough to let them know that u are disappointed. may be, u can also try giving a little punishment, by making them stand or sit in the corner of a room, with no toys. this is the best method of punishment, as the kids are not hurt physically, but the idleness at the corner of a room would make them so bored that they would know, it is a real punishment.                         my son abandons his naughtiness, as soon as i ask him, whether ne needs to stand at the corner of a room. this technique would soon be urs too.  good luck.|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	take a deep breath and count to 10??|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	The first time our daughter did that we told her "no, that's not what we do with our drinkers" and after she did it a 2nd time, the game was over, and so was snack time.  She tried again at dinner time and nipped that in the bud.  She doesn't spill or shake her soppy much any more.     Homier don't play dat!|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I have two boys both very close in age. One is 2 the other 13 months and they drive me nuts. I to sometimes loose it. I smoke cigg. (outside NEVER in my home with the kids) But I take that time for me. Im not sure if you smoke or not but what it concludes is that you need about 5 minutes of "me time" go into the kitchen (example) and block it off with a gate so she cannot get to you. She is fine so who cares if she cries but the time is just for you. Just think calm and it should help a bit. Also try the 10 breath thing. Take ten deep slow breaths before reacting or just to calm yourself down after you have reacted. I know my kid do it the most when I am trying to accomplish something (ie:clean, cook, talk on the phone.) So I know they are trying to get my attention even if it is bad attention. Like right now my son is trying to climb on top of me lol. Im at the computer for me because they just drove me nuts by jumping on the floor and throwing toys. Just keeping your mind somewhere else will be a calming effect. I hope I could be a help. Good luck|`|PrxlHUT5aa	I'd take away the cup.  sit her where there is no liquid or anything to spill after I've reminded her that spilling food on purpose is not a good behavior for a GOOD girl.  After which, I'll go on with my business nonchalantly without paying much attention to her.  I'll avoid the word naughty coz that emphasizes that SHE is naughty and not the BEHAVIOR plus she's getting that attention she doesn't deserve.|`|VMUwtGCuaa	u can discipline her in a soft way|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	If it gets to a point where she is blatantly being defiant, I have to walk away. I've been like that recently anyway (since I'm pregnant and plus she was going through the terrible two phase.) Luckily the past few months she isn't going as wild as she was during the summer months and around November. I just talk to her (when I'm not shouting that's when she knows I mean business). But don't feel bad if you have the need to walk away. We all have dealt with these emotions and its better to cool off and calm down alone, than say or do something in the heat of the moment that you may end up regretting.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	I know exactly how you feel. I got really mad the other day with my 4 yr old son when he was refusing to do simple things.. I didnt spank him or anything but I was extremely mad and I didnt like it either. It happens to all of us. For your little one, she's definetly testing you, to see what you're doing. If she keeps doing things like that, deliberated you have to put her in time out. Yes sit on the step, remove her form the situation.  I also have a 2 year old (turned 2 last week) who's been  slowly transitioning into the terrible 2's for a few months now.   When she does something very naughty, I just pick her up and put her in her crib. She hates it, she screams but sometimes I need that break. I know that she's safe there and she knows she did something wrong. When Im calmer I go pick her up and say "do we throw foods at the table?-a very common thing for her-and she usually says no..or a are you ready to behave? And she's better after that.   None of those things are hurtful for the child, it removes them from the situation, and it tells them that they did something wrong. I also remind her what we should not do.    My daughter also loves to play with her sippy cup and dump it on the place mat after I say No, we dont do that-she keeps on doing it, I just take it away and say Nop you cannot have it. You're spilling it. Usually that causes her to want it and she may have a second chance.   Anyways, those are my tips, and another thing ALWAYS after a punishment remind your child that you love her, and that everything's OK now.. so as not to believe you stopped loving them.     Good Luck!
AA10586477	Believe it or not, I was 13 1/2 weeks before I found out I was pregnant with my handsome son who is now a healthy 3 year old. I had regular periods and no morning sickness. I was blessed and never had it. I went to the ER after taking a plane ride which made me extremely sick to my stomach. When they told me I was pregnant I was like what the heck? My husband was even more in shock. We went to the ultrasound room and saw the baby for the first time. It was the best feeling I had ever experienced!|`|KD8ZsKamaa	HI, i have a usual cycle of 37 days but for some reason it changed to 47 days on the cycle before i conceived. so the cycle i conceived on i calculated at 47 days, so by the time my period was late i was already a few weeks pregnant, I'm currently 18 weeks pregnant, but i had my first doctors appointment at 7 weeks but she never confirmed it as id had a positve pregnancy test the day before she arranged an appointment with my midwife instead. So i had a positive test at 7 weeks, but i didnt have confirmation from a professional until i was a day off being 11 weeks, so i did wonder a lot in that time. but my baby was there lol and now i have a growing bump, 22 weeks to go!  good luck x|`|256cVXsmaa	Well I found out at 6 and a half weeks... soo yea pretty close.

My friend who gave birth oct 08. didnt test and find out until week 12.    God bless x|`|CuTvFlxTaa	With my first baby I was nearly 4 months before I found out. This being due to coming of the Depo Prova in November and not having a period.|`|cUCxi2v5aa	my mum was on the injection and got pregnant but as she did not have periods with the injection and being a big woman she did not know until she was 6 months gone!!!! she only realised when she felt the baby kick one night while watching tv!! imagine that. plus at this time i was 17 so there was a huge gap|`|4lpJRXYsaa	i found out 2 weeks after conception (the day my period was due)|`|GAxJNvxmaa	yeah, it happened to a couple friends of mine. i found out when i was around 5 weeks after i was late for 5 days.|`|TyPrPrIBaa	I was 4 weeks 6 days the morning I took a hpt and the next morning I took another one.. both came back positive. I'm now 10 weeks.|`|tdHIR9cLaa	well i found out when i was 6 weeks... but i know this girl who is a little on the heavier side and has very irregular periods and she did not know she was pregnant until she was 5 months... so... it happens.|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	seriously? I've done ultrasounds on people who didn't know they were pregnant at 30 wks!!   Everyone is different, and some are in denial.|`|5Xz6lcGOaa	i dint find out that i was pregnant untill i was 3 and a half months gone, i had very irregular periods and i didnt think  anything of it, everytime i brushed my teeth in the morning it made me gag, and my mum heard it for a few weeks and she suggested i had a pregnacy test, and i was 3 n a half pregnant!|`|BEXwAnxwaa	With my first i was nealry 2 months pregnant when i found out, i was still bleeding a bit and just assumed it was my period. With my second i was only 3 weeks when i found out and boy did that pregnancy drag. Im pregnant with no.3 now and i found out at about 5 weeks.|`|ZcKVGrUeaa	Yes, I'm 8 weeks right now with my second baby.  I suspected I was pregnant and did a test and was correct - its now been two weeks and I've been to the doctors and everything is okay.  Now just waiting on another little Blessing|`|IA1irLy7aa	yea with my first pregnancy i didnt find out i was pregnant until i was 13 weeks
qR3MYSOIaa	Yes, three different types of abuse, by 3 different people and I don't wish to talk about it.  I'm sorry for what you went through, I know what it's like.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	I'm sorry to hear about that.    I've never been abused.    But once I had a babysitter who made me and my friend (who was a boy) touch each others private parts. She was a weirdo. We were like 5. I told my mom and that ho was FIRED.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	When i was about 5-8 my father was on drugs (like majorly on drugs) an he would hold knifes to my and my moms throats.. Kick me if i didn't clean up my dolls fast enough..while my mom was at work he made me cook and clean..and i was only like 6..and if i didn't he beat me...    This is a touchy subject..i dont want to go into more detail..  Sorry for what happened to you!|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Sorry about what you've been through - I've never been abused.|`|Xz2EQusraa	No I haven't but sorry about that|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	millions, and I'm sorry to hear you where one of them.|`|Tt5Wi49uaa	Question - who many people were abuse as kids?    Answer - Again?|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	I know I sure was and my sister says she was but I never saw her ever even get into trouble, I was always there to jump in and fight her fights for her, until I went in the military that is. She was 10 when I left. So I don't know what happened to her after I left.
z4byzsGLaa	I do, but not sure about what the law says!!|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	I believe it to be child abuse, yes. Poor baby has no way of defending itself from these toxins. Plus, it affects the baby after it is born and sometimes they have to withdrawal the baby from the drugs. That to me is abuse.|`|iMULlxdgaa	should be if its not.|`|xOvPuyfHaa	I do, It causes bad things to be wrong for the baby, and I personally think it should be illegal..|`|K2jT1z5jaa	yes definitely is as. its not giving the baby inside respect or helping with developing baby inside.    god bless|`|7Mhju1mEaa	YES DEFINITELY!!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I believe it is yes... because you are knowingly doing something that could harm your child for life.|`|2jMFurDoaa	i think thats a form of abuse but what the hell is the mother thinking?|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	well, it is a child & that is abuse so yes, it is child abuse.|`|WI5KmVRdaa	OH YES! i think putting your child into any form of danger intentionally is child abuse even if the child is not born he/her has a heart and there is no reason for anyone to do that to a helpless child|`|1jmWmcozaa	Yes she is abusing the child and herself.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I personally think it's one of the worst forms of child abuse, but that's just me.  I know people who did drugs or drank or smoke while pregnant and permanently affected the entire life of their child.  It's extremely selfish.|`|nluNSDI4aa	That is obviously child abuse and neglect. the first trimester is the most crucial time because that's when all the vital organs are growing and forming. A unborn child being exposed to such harshness can have mental issues when born.|`|BTf36bukaa	Yes, it is abuse.|`|eryJKCpfaa	why would a pregnant women do that? if she can not be responsible enough for the welfare of her child when the baby is in utero, i would hate to see what kind of mother should would be|`|Eqln1jmNaa	i most deff think that this is a form of child abuse... its just what i believe|`|PJSSdgf6aa	ofcourse it is! not even a question to ask!|`|Hl76oPn5aa	I belive it is it's basically like letting you're kids do drugs and alchol before the age of 5! it's just like when you eat and drink [pop, water, etc] you are feeding the baby and giving it water,pop,etc but drugs and alchol could possibly kill the baby because it isn't strong and drugs are bad!|`|A5KbJEH1aa	Personally i do yes.  Its a human child inside you and its wrong to do it.    Its not the babies choice to be inside you so yeah i think its completely wrong.    You are a mother from the day you fall pregnant until the day you die and if your not going to take that responsibilty you don't deserve to be a mother in my opinion.    (i don't mean you as in your the one doing it though)|`|zXIDR1INaa	I would say yes and for those who wonder how a person could do these things.  Someone who is so addicted to a drug or alcohol normally cant function unless they have this.  Most of us couldnt think how they could do it but they cant think about anything else except how to get their fix for the day...  Sad but true.|`|4lsp4dtRaa	not good for the baby when he or she is born they have withdrawls and goes through hell after there born, i know this cause i seen wht nephew had to put up with i think it is child abuse.|`|YUV9SNBuaa	Yes of course! I wish it was a law because you are knowingly harming a defenseless human!|`|4v90WyUhaa	I know in the state I live in it's considered child abuse if the baby tests positive for drugs when born. Obviously if the mom's doing it the baby is getting high or drunk so yeah I'd say it's child abuse.|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	For sure!

mQhSxCpoaa	Well to be honest any time you try to force your body to do anything it doesn't want to do, especially in pregnancy, your body is going to react worse to it.   I didn't like being induced. First they had to pop my water (uncomfortable even in a hospital setting although it didn't really hurt), then they had to hook me up to all these IV's and give me Pitocin which is designed to help your body dilate. It makes the contractions harder, faster, but that does not necessarily mean you are going to give birth any quicker. It is totally unnatural to do it this way. It took me around 28 hours to give birth to my 6 lb 14 oz daughter! That's not exactly a BIG baby. They had to use forceps and a suction cup to get her out, because she just didn't want to go.   I had to get induced related to Toxima which isn't good I realize. It was better to BE induced but, to be honest I wouldn't recommend them doing it just to get you in and out before the weekend (watch them, you'll notice it seems at times like that is what is happening!).  But all together uncomfortable and just plain a not very pretty experience.|`|RPszYGXkaa	Well it didn't hurt right away...I was already 4cms dilated and 95% effaced, and I was just over 38 weeks along.  The pitocin wasn't too bad, it was when they broke my water...oh mama.  There is no break between contractions (just enough to catch your breath), and they hurt, but I haven't had a non induced labor, so I can't compare it.  I hope that if I am lucky enough for another baby, that I can go into labor on my own.  Best wishes!    EDIT - labor is usually faster, from the time I went into the hospital until she was born was only about 6.5 hrs!  PS - even though it hurt like nothing I have ever felt before...the joy in your heart when you meet your child makes it all so worth it!|`|QVg9KB1vaa	I was induced with my second child and I'm so glad I was.  I had an epidural as soon as the contractions started to get painful, so it was a lot more comfortable for me than my first birth.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	When they induce you your contractions become strong and closer together much faster than they normally would. You don't get to ease into labor. That is probably what people mean when they say that it hurts.|`|6fiYhtACaa	Yes it does hurt, if you don't have an epidural. The reason is that they give you synthetic oxytocin called pitocin. It is the hormone responsible for contractions among other things. With a normal delivery, your contractions are spread out more, but with pitocin, it causes longer, closer and harder contractions. Owww!! Mine felt someone was kicking me in the lower back with a steel-toe boot on. I finally gave in and had an epidural placed which felt like heaven once it was inserted. The goal of pitocin is also to get your cervix to fully dilate.|`|MqFeJiukaa	I have been induced twice.  I can't say my labor was honestly any worse then when I wasn't induced.  I have 4 children and my middle 2 were the ones induced.  My oldest 2 I had no epidural.  I can honestly say my 2nd labor was my easy.  I was only contracting for 4 hrs and was really in control of my breathing and stayed focused on a spot on the ceiling (lol it looked like snoopy).  The 2 times I was induced my labors were faster.

z5MURXDaaa	try different position    make sure that she is comfortable.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I can't say it was great but I had sex the night before my water broke so all the way to the end.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think we gave up around the beginning of the third trimester.  It was uncomfortable for me, a little unsettling for him and awkward for everybody.  It's not such a big deal, it's a different point in your life, and a relatively brief one.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Never. Try different positions.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	around 12 weeks, As i didnt want it much. Then definitely stopped at 16 weeks- due to threatned mis./c,  And havent since  God bless x|`|5EiShLZZaa	Um, about the time I found I was pregnant....too tired and no drive what so ever!  I'm 16 weeks now, not getting any more in the mood...|`|hoX7hoINaa	You dont have to stop. Sex is okay throughout pregnancy as long as it isn't rough. Its probably just weird because your body is changing (and you may feel leery about showing your new body off to your partner) Give it time. Your sex drive will go up again, and its fine up until the end. Especially if you end up going past due date, it could help induce labor :)|`|AA10780655	Ive only had sex one time the whole time Ive been pregnant  And that was around 5 months and it really wasnt that enjoyable  I just have no desire for it|`|XNkPciEoaa	I only had sex occasionally when I was pregnant.  It never felt comfortable and it always made my hips hurt.  You can safely have sex up until your water breaks.  Good luck|`|AA11029380	Never did stop.|`|KVq8QLqYaa	im also 5 months and doc said keep going at it..haha good exercise.. try not to be on ur back though cuts off blood supply to the baby..experiment with new positions till you find one thats comfortable for you|`|6fiYhtACaa	After about three months. Once I started to show it was just too weird for us both and then towards the end it was just too uncomfortable.|`|Jo3Ma2NOaa	i havent yet....(im 36 weeks)...i had my moments during my pregnacy when it was uncomfortable or i just didnt want to be touched...but the urge came back...but the most comfortable for me is layin on my back or on my side (and let my husband do all the work|`|7QjlDvs6aa	never did with both my boys and pregnant with  3 an dont see me giving it up this time either lol
K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    its sounds like possible misc/ bcause of the clotting. but not everyone experiences bleeding or cramping together. its common to have bleeding in early pregnancy.  Brown is old blood. The red-to pink isnt too good. But the dark isgood.  You are maybe experiencing morning sickness. You may still be experiencing symptoms.    i advise you to definitely go and get a blood test done soon.  or ultrasound.    God Bless x Stay strong it could be mis.c but it may not be|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Blood clots while on your period are common and normal. Vomiting can be caused by lots of things.|`|QlbaXYeLaa	No hun. ..You would be in a lot of pain if you had a miscarriage. Spotting is normal during pregnancy. Just calm down and relax. Give your doctor a call tomorrow and talk to him about it. He will know best. |`|jNqf8HtDaa	if you miscarry you would have a really hard cavity thats slimmy come out and it would be a dark red so i just think your body might be cleanin you out but if you were pregnant if you went to the hospital and they draw blood they could tell you if you were    good luck|`|nluNSDI4aa	wow. sweety, you really need to go to the doctor and get checked out because that does not sound normal. I have had a miscarriage recently and it happen nothing like what you just explained. Go and seek medical help to answer your question and to make sure your health is okay.hope all is well though and God bless you|`|haF1rO2taa	stress can do a lot to a womans body. going by a reg cycle its about a week after per to conceive and still more time for egg to get to uterus so i would say it is too soon if you were preg to be miscarrying. dont worry too much, the doc usually say stuff like that is due to stress. now if you are in a lot of pain  and running a fever i would worry. as for throwing up the bug has been going around and you should keep yourself hydrated. when you preg you dnt just vomit one day.|`|4lsp4dtRaa	when u have a miscarriage you have heaps of pain|`|ejxCPI43aa	no, thats nothing like a miscarriage. but i do recoment going ot the er or doctor right away !!! good luckkk !!!!|`|YT48OTKzaa	no sweetie you might be having a baby just go to your doc to really find out|`|HPCetoNkaa	Well you have a yeast infection that's the brown discharge. You didnt have a miscarriage cause you would of been in pain. You might be pregnant if you had sex a whole week after your period ended
kaqPSgTVaa	Take another test. That sounds strange. Did you look at the test after 10 minutes? If so the results aren't accurate anymore.
rFMRgHTdaa	I think the baby will be fine. Especially if the parents get along. If the mother makes sure that she is not paying for the child's clothes or food while she is with her dad then she doesn't need to take him to court. I think they should each pay for the child's need when the child is with them and then everything will be fine.|`|KWVz0OhVaa	sorry but i think he should get out of her life before he screws it up even more :(|`|rNdun1V7aa	what is clouding??? and i guess that depends on how she is treated by her father, and what her perception of him is.|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	she already likes him.|`|xbFhE5Tkaa	Clouding?  This makes NO sense,  SORRY!|`|FkunZ9q4aa	Clouding?  I'm not sure what you're getting at.    The father should be paying child support.  No matter what, he needs to support her more than he is.|`|nvpZS2YXaa	clouding? pretty sure it's clothing.|`|PRjCv4KJaa	YOU PEOPLE!  all i got was would the following girl little girl like her daddy  then i thought, that doesnt make any sense  and i looked to the end and saw also buys her clouding and takes her out, and thought, if shes a little girl, how do u take her out and buy her 'clouding'  too long|`|EwNrlF8jaa	Well its good that he even wants to do what he is doing. Some dads just dont do anything. If this situation works for them then let things be. Children are not concerned with money ect. They may not remember things we bought them but will remember time spent with them and how loved they felt during those times. Good Luck.|`|yC9TKKghaa	Ummm like i dont exactly know she probobly loves you cuz ur her dad but with all the drama thats going on shes probobly had enough if she is my age (13) she probobly wouldnt wanna go see the family her dad lives with instead of her and at my age we realize the gifts are kind-of-bribes and that her dad only buys her those to fill in the time she doesnt get to spend with him. that may not even be how u feel but at 13 we think most things are obvious|`|74mDvMJraa	Okay. First of all, the mother and the father need to sit down and work out all of the details. The father DEFINITELY needs to help with money perhaps split it fifty fifty. I understand that they don't want to take each other to court, that is necessary sometimes, but as long as they both stick to this plan that they work out, then there won't be any need. The child is the most important here and in order to make the most of their life, they need support from both sides equally. Especially later on, when their needs become more and more expensive.|`|d6mVkJ3Oaa	Father is definitely doing the best he can and his little girl will love him.  Unfortunately it sounds like there will be tensions and fighting around them.        ----You people are being unnecessarily rude!|`|l6TzxyN1aa	what is clouding?    and what does this have to do with the topic|`|xQYxSvYraa	this question makes no sense.|`|b24a186d94cd66e3909fc8c200a56ebbaa	Clouding?    You mean clothing?    Work on your spelling.    And uh, this sort of doesnt make sense.    Either way, he should pay for child support.|`|8OvTtGiZaa	When she goes to see her father, make sure she has on old clothes with holes in them that smell.  Sending her without breakfast wouldn't hurt her either.  He won't have a leg to stand on and If he asks why she looks that way and why shes hungry you can tell him a bid f'n scum bag and that you wouldn't have said anything, but he asked. Also be sure that he needs to be takin to court to be sure he steps up to responsibilties ot he will disappear.  I would never let my kids go without, but then not everyone is like me...Or You|`|N0hlErEyaa	she shouldn't like him and the mom should take him to court moms usually win in court for children
P544Sbmqaa	Usually when tattoos are given that early, its some sort of religious symbol or symbol of their heritage.  Most people who have had that done accept it as who they are.  I mean, most parents dont just go around putting tats on their toddlers because they are cute, it is usually symbolic of something specific.      I wonder how circumscized males feel?  They didnt have a choice, but most of them just accept it as who they are.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Because people either let their kids do what they want.  Or treat them like property and do what they the parents want.|`|shBj5RElaa	you have to be the stupidist person on earth jessica, aka tattogirl    go awa already, NO ONE would give a 3 yr old a tattoo, but you need a labotomy|`|VuUz8NgKaa	They are either stupid or like midnight said.        Thanks story for the laugh, I almost choked on my water.
qN5iVvAFaa	actually i got my first tattoo when i was 3 years old.... i don't regret it at all, especially with all the laws in Oregon that say you can't get one until you are 18... it was just on my foot. no one can see it unless i am walking around barefoot... i have always thought it was cool. now im 18 and have 3 tattoos total|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I doubt it.     Harriet|`|sYjYbkvWaa	I did not nor do I currently have a tattoo. BUT having been 13 once a long time ago, I do know that I am interested in completely different things. My priorities as an adult are completely different than when I was a child of 13. I can't imagine that anything you would had tattoed on your body now would mean as much to you later or even look the same. You aren't through growing, so I can't imagine the tattoo would still look the same. Listen to your parents. I assume they are telling you that this is a bad idea.|`|VEnVl264aa	most states its illeagal if your under 18 but you can at 16 with parents permission. never heard of a 10 or 13 year old having a tat|`|047dd891d3b2f95a8772081d47f8d49caa	I don't know of any self-respecting artist that would give a tattoo to a child, and if it was done by a parent, CYS should be called on them.    I got my first tattoo when I was 20, and ended up having it covered because I was short-sighted enough to get something I didn't really love.  A kid that age is in no way mature enough to make permanent markings on their bodies.|`|Tt5Wi49uaa	2 points|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I got my first tattoo before Kindergarten.  It's a bad *** tatt of cookie monster.  Still looks great after 34 years!|`|PlmT4lHXaa	yeah i got a tattoo of elmo on my butt when i was two. i love it.    nott really|`|lGrcLQ49aa	I just can not figure out where you come up with this crap
pzLDXL6gaa	It honestly depends on the 18 year old. What her mother has told her, what her own experiences with her father are, how she feels towards him, whether she has space for somebody else in her life right now. Maybe she's made up her own mind about him, or maybe she's made up her own mind about her mother. Also, I find it hard to believe that the mother would do this without a reason. Did he cheat or was he abusive or something? It's usually something like that in cases where the mother doesn't want the child to see the father, though forgive me if that's not the case here. Additionally, unless she was really rich, at least some of the child support would have had to be spent on the child. Always worth getting in contact to see what the girl's view are, though.    Harriet|`|FvhCUHjxaa	I turn 19 in a week so I hope I can help you with your question. If it was me, I would give him a chance, everybody deserves a chance. Then I'd probably have a serious heart to heart with my mom and it would probably get ugly. Children that grow up without two parents do end up having more problems growing up so I would be mad that he wasn't in my life and that my mom basically lied about it for 18 years.     ETA: Unless he was in jail or something I would want to meet him. Sometimes people lie in courts; it does happen. I hate getting lied to so I get so angry when people lie to me or treat me like a little kid.|`|68c6B8dRaa	She might feel he's a bit of a dick if he wants to ramble on about "if her mother had let him. The only reason why she did no see him allot is because her mother was paying games in family court and he had to fight hard to see her in the courts. He still wants to have a good relation ship with her and hoped that her mother did not destroy that..."    "Honey, I always wished I could be close to you. I have long hoped you might want a closer relationship with me. If you do, I am here. You are my daughter and I love you very much" will be much, much better than 'proving' stuff about child support blah blah blah. She doesn't need to know that about her mother.    Number one rule of divorce for parents: never ever talk crap about the other parent in front of the child.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	There's no way to tell.....a lot of times the child gets angry at the wrong parent because it's easier to be angry with the wrong parent.  So no matter how you paint the picture, she still might be mad at the Dad instead of the Mom.  I say, be there, offer and pursue a relationship, always be positive, easy going and loving.  Do not bad-mouth the other parent unless the other parent is being abusive or really placing the child in harm's way.|`|mppKv11Eaa	Probably fall out (grow apart from) a bit with her mother and strive to meet with the dad.|`|eDVzT3I8aa	The 18 year old, would use her adult mind, and realize that no one is perfect, and I'm sure the child support was not only spent on the mother but also on the child.  Words are easy, actions speak loudly.  If the father wants to prove that he is a good man, then the first step would NOT be to drag the child's mother through the mud and accuse her of neglecting her daughter.  A good father, would make amends for all the years he has missed, instead of trying to alienate the daughter from her mother.  This man needs to have a reality break.

I've never known a Cecilia before and while your other names are unique as well, Cecilia is my favorite because it is so feminine and strong!    Jesse is a great name for a boy. You never want to give a boy a super trendy or unique name because they will tend to be made fun of easier than girls. A girl with a super out-of-this-world name is cute, but for some reason it just doesn't work that way for guys in most situations. That's just my opinion though.|`|5eKS8Dzcaa	AHHHHH  LOVE THEM    k love Irelyn and Scarlett and Ryanne    what about Scarlett Ryanne or Irelyn Scarlett!!    boys i like Jesse Frederick|`|AA11490722	Cecilia Ryanne    and    Rowan Frederick are my favourites from you list

That's an oxymoron honey. No boy is capable of being normal nor behaving. That being said, I think every person is different and maybe this person is a little wishy-washy. Make yourself less available to him and see how he acts.
F0kjf1j8aa	Yes, you can be pregnant and bleed, I think you should take a test anyway, if you are pregnant it should show up even though you are bleeding, if you are pregnant I would get to the doctor and get checked out to make sure every things ok and you are not having a miscarriage|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Maybe you could be. Take a test...it's the only way to know for sure.    What you are feeling in your lower abdomen wouldn't be your uterus yet. That is still tucked under your pelvic bone. You are probably feeling your intestines. Your uterus also wouldn'tt move around. It's pretty stationary.|`|t8HPCzrOaa	hun i dont think your period it sound like your having your period i sex a few days be4 i had my period and a lil blood was coming out because your close to having your period so yea but if you missed your period take the hpt but yea hun relax i think its your period since you didnt missed it yet but still take the test just in case good luck|`|CuCrGDuRaa	You should schedule an appointment to get checked out by your doctor.  There is a chance you may have kidney stones, a kidney infection, or a bladder infection.  If you haven't tested positive for pregnancy, there is a chance that you are just experiencing your period.  Every time I've been pregnant I didn't have the symptoms you experienced until I was 6-8 weeks pregnant.  Just to be safe, see your doctor.|`|mQhSxCpoaa	All those symptoms do point to a problem. I say take the test soon. As soon as your 'period' like symptoms start fading away a little bit. They are only a dollar at the Dollar General and they are pretty accurate. At least you could take the test and know if you have anything to worry about or not.|`|78bf0c65f06e027e97ae9f826071b2c4aa	I would take another test. Just cause your bleeding doesn't mean your not pregnant. If your bleeding like you normally would or heavier. You may have had a miscarriage.  Your story remind me how i got pregnant. My boyfriend and I had sex. I had all the symptoms. 5 weeks later I miscarried.  I was 16 years old. Good luck.
JGpirCtLaa	Yeah some people have a regular period when they're pregnant.|`|p68DUZhCaa	yea take an hpt|`|YT48OTKzaa	yes you could be please go to the doctor and be check out

oGHtaaCkaa	I think maybe he does like you, but I think you two should just stay friends for now. It sounds like he looks up to you and looks at you as a best friend. Be proud to be that one girl who can be there for him (even when his girlfriend can't!) and hold on to that for a while.  Just continue being the great friend that you are and maybe someday something will change.|`|xJwPKtX9aa	yes, he does. i think if you guys start going out he'll be less depressed.|`|YDs5mdHTaa	Yeah i think he does. but i think you should kinda help him with his cutting... Not judging or any thing. He sounds like a great friend!
AaoclPYCaa	Stage 3 baby food is just big people food mushed up.  She should be able to eat a lot of things that are not baby food if she is ready for Stage 3.  Mashed potatoes, creamed corn, diced carrots, peas, anything that is soft and can be mushed up pretty easy.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	7.5-8 completely on table food by 9 months.|`|5TvyhgP6aa	Just skip stage 3.  It is not necessary, tastes yucky and by the time they are ready for it they can eat what you eat.  Just mash what you are eating for dinner and feed it to your baby.  Noodles, shredded cheese, grated fruit, rice, avocado, eggs....  have fun!|`|9Chvfjzfaa	my son is 6  months and i started him at 5 months he was on cerel a 3 weeks as adviced by doctor and he is going to table food now since his teeth are coming in|`|RYmkmyuvaa	My baby started at 6 months.  He started solid foods at 3.5 months, so by 6 months he was ready for stage 3.  Make sure they chew, or I do not think they are ready.  Mine is now 7 months and chewing, moving food around on both sides, and self feeding small "table scraps;)" At first he gagged and didn't like the texture, but after a day or two he got used to it.
2arZOZWgaa	Babies, yes even a seven month old, needs parented to sleep. Some babies magically fall asleep on their own and sleep through the nights. Most children need their care giver to provide a safe, relaxing environment in which they can fall asleep.    That being said, I have always given my daughter the chance to fall asleep on her own with the knowledge that I would most likely be called back in to help soothe her to sleep. Keep up what you are doing, wait till you can tell that she needs you to come back in before you rush to her aid. Some whimpering and whining might be happen, but she shouldn't be crying hysterically or left to "cry it out" whatever IT is.    She needs to be on a consistent bed time routine and being going to bed the same way, the same place for this to work. The routine should involve whatever it is that puts baby to bed. You might have to change it up before you find what works the best. For example, my daughter was always put to bed by her father and I, but she would always call us back in. When we went to just one of us putting her to bed, with a story and a bottle, she goes right to sleep.     Understand that at the ripe old age seven months there is no guaranteed, tried and true method for getting baby to go to sleep every time.    I followed the guidelines below (catered to our family's needs of course) and at 11 months, Lilly goes to sleep by herself or with minimal interference for naps and bedtime almost every single time.|`|68c6B8dRaa	But you're a parent; putting your child to bed is part of your job.    In a few years it will be a storybook and a cuddle and kiss. Later on maybe just a chat about how the day went and a kiss. Right now, though, what you're doing is perfectly appropriate for 7mo.     They are only this little for a very short time. _You_ will regret not making with the cuddles while you can.|`|f5udtuwBaa	its harder at this age but it will take a lot of persistence on your part.    baby needs to be settled in the cot. try some soothing music, dim the room and pat her, massage her, rock her.    try not to give her eye contact or talk to her. i've taken away toys and musicals etc that stimulate my baby    if a baby falls to sleep and feels safe on mummy then goes into a cold insecure cot she wont want to stay there.    i'm no professional but ive been getting the same help from my nurse to settle my baby who's 13 weeks.    maybe also try wrapping her in a large single bed size sheet to fit her    good luck|`|R0EsQapRaa	Does she get a bottle right before bed?  Is she still wide awake after the bottle?  My baby is 8 months and for the longest time our routine has been this....  7:30 bathtime, right after the bath she gets an 8oz. bottle (doesn't always drink all 8 oz.).  I feed her while I sit propped up on the bed in our guest bedroom with the lights off.  There is a nightlight so that I can see.  She drinks her formula and either falls asleep during that or gets very drowsy.  I burp her (sometimes she falls asleep and nothing comes out).  I put her in her crib and turn on the humidifier (for the white noise) and put the pacifier in her mouth and she is out like a light!  She usually sleeps through until 7:00am (although alot of times I go into her room in the middle of the night to put her pacifier back in because she is whimpering a little).    Hope that helps :)|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Though it is probably time consuming, my advice is to continue doing what works for her. She needs your comfort and does not feel secure with just being placed in the crib. It makes sense that she would want to be rocked, since it is what she is used to. As another answerer mentioned, sometimes giving them a bottle right at the time they would normally fall asleep can allow you to put the baby to sleep without having to hold her. This is how we do it some nights. Other nights, I rock my son or lay next to him until he dozes off.  Take care!|`|BUCwZYnzaa	let her cry. give her a sippy and just let her cry. if you keep rocking her or going in there every time she cries then you are going to be doing it for a very long time. if she is tired she will cry herself to sleep in about 10 to 20 mins. i know it sucks the first few times but it does get easier. good luck|`|eth48m7Iaa	I let my kids cry for a couple of days and after that they would fall asleep no problem everyday. Keep her on a schedule they like that. I used to sing my daughter a lullaby every night and then lay her down and pray with her and she never cried.|`|p6AMoTs8aa	very hard to do, i have the same problem with my 8month old girl. its because we have been rocking her to sleep every night. she sleeps with us in bed and i turn off the lights and she dozes off on her own but  i still cant get her to do that in her crib|`|qBEt621jaa	Pay no attention to "Do your own thinking" - it IS part of your job to help your child become independent.  Learning to fall asleep on your own is just another childhood milestone.  Keep a consistent bedtime routine (i.e. bath, book, cuddles) and then put your baby down in a quiet, dark room.  You may want to give her a nightlight or crib light that plays music on demand.  She will cry.  Check on her every 5 mins. at first, then every 10, and so on.  Do not lift her out of bed.  Just reassure her that you're there.  Soon enough she will fall asleep.  You will have a few rough nights but after a while she will learn to get herself to sleep.  This will make for a happier, more confident child and also a much better rested mother!  Good luck.|`|LwJ7EiZ4aa	My daughter is 7 months also and we were going through the same thing up until 3 weeks ago. I bought the book Good Night, Sleep Tight and it has been amazing! I do not believe in "crying it out" so this was the book for me. The key is to get her on a solid schedule so she knows what is coming next. For example, my daughter's night routine is as follows: 6:45pm we start by giving her a bottle, then it is bathtime and I let her play a little, then it is lotion and pjs, then we read a book, then I sit with her a cuddle her, then its time for bed. Now she goes right down with no problems at 7:30pm every night because she knows what is coming next. Also part of my daughter's problem was that she was over tired from not sleeping enough during the day...a vicious cycle. Therefore, get Ava on a strict eating and naptime schedule too. But get the book. It has been the BEST $14 that I ever spent. I am happier and so is Koren. Good luck! :)

fiUqIyVcaa	Life is not fair.  Sometimes it seems that the good people in this world get punished while the wicked in the world get rewarded.    I know exactly how you feel.  I had got pregnant with my son without any problems.  But when my husband and I wanted another child, it just did not happen.  For 12 years it did not happen.    It seemed like everyone that I knew and everywhere that I looked, women were having babies, but I couldn't.    Then God remembered me, just when I had completely given up all hope.  I was soooooo blessed with twin baby girls.  It was a prayer that was answered even though the doctors told me that they never saw how it was even possible that I ever conceived again.  Whenever I look as my little angels from heaven, I know that God truly does hear our prayers and does still work miracles.    Don't give up.  Keep trying and have faith in God.  Sometimes it is so hard to try to understand the things that we can't.  But all things happen in God's time and he is never too late.    God bless, I will pray that you conceive soon!|`|bcZSIphUaa	Tell me about it!    IT SUCKS!    I have PCOS and I don't deserve it at all.    All I want is to have children and I would look after them so well.    I've started fertility treatment and I am hopeful that one day it will happen for me.    Boo hoo it helps to have a cry sometimes...we all have bad days when we are battling infertility : (        There is always hope though.|`|8RfmosODaa	There really is no reason.

We were homeless in fl for 3 months because she choose drugs, when I say homeless I mean homeless like we lived in her ex bf truck and there was 7 of us so we would take turns sleeping in the truck and sleeping on the beach (Seriously) anyways I had to deal with it until dcyf (children services) took us. she got us back and we moved to the keys where I meet and fell in-love with my bf Jeff, we have been living together every since then, thank god I don't live with my mom any more. Well good luck|`|dShnJ20raa	Talk to child services and a family lawyer to see what options you may have thats all I can suggest. It's good to see that you care for your baby sister so much. Good luck I hope you figure something out|`|fi7Aq9cWaa	In order to emancipate yourself, you have to live on your own, and have a job that can support yourself without any help from your parents. Do you have a job that allots enough money to pay for rent, bills, and food for both you and yor sister?|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	you may be able to emancipate yourself under those circumstances but your sister will be more than likely placed with foster care if the father isn't deemed a competent parent. I'm sorry. The law will not see your sister in the same way they will see you, and unfortunately you will be cutting the line for emancipation. You must have a full time job and prove you can support yourself for emancipation in any state. Are you able to do those things? I know it's possible at 16, because I did it myself.|`|mppKv11Eaa	What that guy said (first poster)....    I really don't have any idea what to do here, but, the best option would be to consult the lawyer. If you can, try to go live with some close relatives or family friends, if you have them. still visit your mom, because she's your mom, and she may not say it or show it, but she probably loves you both and is just to addicted to her drugs to realize it herself...|`|B1HCpLGoaa	are there any teachers  you can talk to at school or other family members that could help you? i hope you get every thing work out and for the best!
ZxCJDyR6aa	I'd take the test before you get your mom all worried. If the test shows you're pregnant, then to tell your mom, start a conversation with her and then get her on the topic of pregnancy and then tell her about you. Or just come out and tell her right away if you know she wont be upset or anything. It's a hard thing to tell parents something important like that, but you're better off getting it out of the way so you don't keep worrying about it. If you're mom really loves you she'll understand and help you through this. *I'd also add in that asking your close friends about how to ask is also good|`|UBypaQtFaa	Why don't you just go buy a pregnancy test?  They even sell them at the dollar store!|`|IxLkAEA3aa	It sounds like you might just be pregnant... you should go to the store and but a test 1st read the instructions in it because your only supposed to take them at certian times and if its possative just leave it somewhere your mom will find it... thats what i did i was 17 when i got pregnant and i didnt know what to tell my mom so i left my posative test on the table for her to find while i was at school... by the time i got home she had calmed down about it and we talked.    good luck!|`|VjAIMn3Xaa	Get a pregnancy test. See if it's positive or negative. If it's positive, get an abortion. Your mom never has to know.|`|G4b34W03aa	Your mom already knows that the potential for you being pregnant is there. Tell your mom how/what you have been feeling. Then you need to get a home pregnancy test and find out if you really are pregnant. If that comes out positive you should go to your doctor and make sure. Really you should make an appointment to see your doctor even if it comes out negative. Just to be sure. Relax your mom's number one concern I'm sure is to make sure you are healthy and happy. I'm sure after the initial shock wears of she will be fine. Hope this helps, and best wishes!

mppKv11Eaa	If it meant it was better for my children? Yes. no thought or anything. If my kids can be happy, then I'll be happy. I may not have kids, yet, but I would still do it when I do, if i do, have my kids. I think being a mom is one of the best things about being a woman. Of course, I'll still need to be independent...I just wanna be a mom (not, now. I'm too young), not a homemaker. To me, mom is synonymous with the word protector.|`|Xz2EQusraa	Yes of course|`|axdgDiGMaa	in a heartbeat|`|FiUprYsvaa	I'd sell my soul the devil for cheap.|`|wo9goWXUaa	this question itself is unethical|`|BJERgbM5aa	Of course.  To understand that concept, you have to be a parent.|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	Yes, in a heartbeat!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Wow this is a pretty good question. Honestly it's hard to say yes or no to it because if I gave my soul to my child(ren), they'll be up in Heaven, while I'm in Hell. There would be no point in that because I wouldn't be able to spend my eternal life with them. It also makes you think would I be tortured for my children? It's so hard to say yes or no, because if you live for your children, how could I manage to live without them?    Good question though.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	thats an impossible question for me.  my god would never forcefully want my soul to save my child.  i don't care about thumbs down.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Read this whole thing im not preaching:  I have thought of this because I am a christian and I do want to go to heaven but in the "end of times" we must choose to go with god or the anti christ. (by taking the mark) And in what has been said that could happen is that you will loose everything if you worship god and will not take the beast. I choose that to feed and cloth my children and to make sure they went to heaven that yes I would go to hell. Hands down I would never want my boys to go to hell.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Thumbs down any Biblical answer? Gee, that's fair. Might as well not even answer. You mentioned heaven, yet we're not allowed to talk about the Bible? How is that not being judgmental?    No, I would not give up my soul. They already have a soul, they don't need mine. Give up my life, yes. But there's a difference. My soul has nothing to do with *their* salvation.|`|MLgknFlVaa	yes, my children are my everything|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I don't know enough about the bible to quote it.  I would probably give up my soul for my child(ren) if I believed in the whole soul thing.  I'm not sure that I do, so it's hard to really answer.  I would do A LOT for my kids.|`|VGzi6KaFaa	i would kill myself or do anything for my child's salvation|`|1G3XPiq3aa	What do you mean by salvation? Do you mean they'd go to heaven, or just be saved from death?     Generally, I'd do anything to stop harm coming to my daughter, but if I knew for certain there was an after life, I'm not sure I'd spend the rest of eternity in hell without the chance to ever see her again if she was going to go to heaven regardless.    So, if it was the only way for to go to heaven, yes without a second thought, but if it would only save her from death and I knew without a doubt there was an afterlife, I would have to think about it because an eternity without her is the worst thing I can imagine.|`|veO1RXrCaa	No biblical answers here.  But there is not one thing I have that I would not give my children.  From something silly like the hair on my head to my soul.    ETA WTF!  Why did I get a thumbs down?  LOL!  Who wouldn't give up everything and anything for their kids?|`|JWa78QVoaa	Absolutely not, and that doesn't not take away my perfect love for them.  Eternity is cannot be measured but a lifetime can easily be.  Simple.  My soul is not for sale in any shape, form, or fashion.  Period!, and the way that I raise my kiddo's, they wouldn't give theirs for me or anyone else either.|`|5D0KuT74aa	if i didn`t would they go to hell?  and i think you are one very bitter atheist who doesn`t want any christians answering  but no, i wouldn't  do you know how long eternity is?  it is unimaginable  i would not  sorry|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Sure, if I knew that really existed. I'm an avid Y!A user, so I don't think I have much of a soul left anyways|`|FxXaBd16aa	I would give my own life to protect my child's. If that is what you mean    geez sorry that i said life.. why are you so angry?|`|ZejwYamhaa	I would do anything for my children's life ANYTHING|`|nfzQkvqraa	Why with all the ethical questions?  I would e mail and ask, but you don't allow it.  I can't answer this question as I'm not sure how to, but I'm going to answer your previous one.|`|1iXvphNYaa	You may give me a thumbs down, but GOD wont. You cant even begin to imagine what hell is so you cant really get an honest answer here. Now, I'm begging you to play with me. I've got my plastic dart guns with me.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	yes, because assuming there is some sort of afterlife here...    I couldn't handle living without my children for any amount of time.    But in theory, isn't whatever God you believe in supposed to be kind? Dont you think that whatever powers control heaven/afterlife/whatever would take mercy on someone sacrificing so much for their children?    either way, yes I would. I would hope someday to see them again, but my babies are my everything.|`|aDeV0hhcaa	I am not quite an adult yet,but honestly I would.I want my kids to have a successful life,to do what I couldn't,and pass on the Nguyen family   name.Yes,I am Vietnamese.If you thought I was Chinese than F*** you.I hate that mistake ,I can't take it.|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	I'm selling my soul right now trying to help my disabled son  from a county trying to put him back in prison he already went to prison from a hick town called Alturas, ca.
TQW5E6olaa	I would do anything to ensure my child's survival.|`|c2kopbo6aa	im trying to set a good example for my children so i would work hard  to get to wherever i need to be..|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I would have to say strip. Selling your body and gold digging are the exact same things but just in different terms. But if I did have the choice to strip, I'd always have a mask over my face, honestly.    Of course if getting a job is impossible that would be my very last resort but just thinking that I know I would have to be desperate.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Short of physically harming someone else, there is nothing I wouldnt do to take care of my children.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Id f everyone in sight.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i wouldn't have to do any of those things.  this isn't hugh hefners world.  its the real world.  those situations aren't the only choices.  if they were that would be a different story.  i would get a job and get assistance.  i would collect change and buy my child the cheapest food i could.  i would starve for my child but i wouldn't have to strip,  sell my body, gold dig, or beg to feed them.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	i couldnt sell my body, strip if i was desperate maybe gold dig but only if i couldnt get a real job.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Well I'm thinking that a normal job would be the first thought, I think that rather than losing my self respect by exposing my body I might lose it by exposing my bank account to welfare for some food stamps.  I think I might also do some natural cooking, like from my garden that I would plant and wheat to make bread and pasta and other things.  There are way more options than prostitution or stripping.  It's not like your child wouldn't realize what mommy does and get a little messed up in the head over that.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Well I would probably strip.....I like to earn my money, and I'm not sure selling my body would work for me, but stripping, yeah, I would do that.  The whole begging or gold digging, not my style, I like to earn my way.    Of course, this is all theoretical and I'm chosing one of the options you gave me, in all likelihood I would chose none of those options and find another way to earn money to feed my kid.  Besides, ain't nobody paying to see this woman strip, too many stretch marks and c-section scars! LOL|`|AA10985602	First I'd dumpster dive for some immediate food  I'd pawn my stuff if I had any.  Then try to get a job  Apply for food stamps and possibly cash assistance  I don't think ANYONE wants to see me strip!  For my kid, I'd definitely strip or sell my body. Gold digging would be last on my list.|`|ScHW4842aa	I would do whatever it takes.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Hell I would do just about anything except murder for my kids.  Beg, borrow or steal.|`|AA12221392	if I couldn't get a job, and couldn't get state help, after exhuasting every known way to get money, i would do anything to get my kids food, except steal And kill someone .    I would not want to do any of those things but it is my responability, if I am the only parent taking care of them to provide , and I would do that by whatever means I had to....|`|mU2eMSi3aa	All 4 at the same time!  Now that would be a show!|`|xQYxSvYraa	strip or gold dig..i dont think i could ever sell my body...|`|dZ3OWHXaaa	fing is mom or dad nd make them give me some money not sell my body or so 2 a food place|`|B1HCpLGoaa	Apply for food stamps! or may be get a job|`|vnpzESubaa	I would say to get your ******* sorry pussy licking self up and get a job you worthless waste of sperm|`|JyEoCBrJaa	I would not do any of those things. In todays society there are many ways a single parent can feed a starving child. Food stamps? TANF? Food banks? Some organizations also help single parents find jobs and housing. So there is no need to strip or sell your body to feed your child. At some point in your life you have to say I can't do this alone and ask for assistance.|`|I1SP0tBMaa	who wouldnt, i would do anything to keep my kids fed|`|nfzQkvqraa	Well, I would possibly strip......IF there was no family, the jobs that were available weren't going to make ends meet and if there was no way to get any kind of assistance.    That said....No one would want to see me strip I bet.  I wouldn't want to see me strip.  I would probably do almost anything to feed my children IF I were single and had to.  Since I've never been in that situation, I'm not sure what horrible thing I'd turn to first.  (because let's admit it, none of those things are ideal)|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	No I would and could not sale body or gold dig however  I did beg from family friends   I worked as a noon aide many yrs ago and I would keep the food that the kids did not eat and feed it to my kids for dinner and the milks I keep the fruit the veggies the sandwiches pizza.|`|cDVAEHgCaa	Hell yes!  I'd do whatever it took in order to take care of my baby.|`|nGxrvQavaa	I wouldn't strip.... I'd get stage fright.    I would gold dig..... that requires certain skills I don't have.    I wouldn't beg...... That never does any good.    So... all that's left is selling myself. If it meant my child living, I would without hesitation, although every girl knows it's not something one would actually WANT to do.|`|fdxQlQZ5aa	I would never strip, sell my body, or bed under any circumstances...Never in my life no matter what. I couldn't live with myself even if its for a good cause; my child but thats not something I'd ever do because it would hurt my son inside so much and I want him to be happy with his life, not need to worry and know his mom would never put herself in danger or those situations.     If this was actually the case, I would get a real job no matter what it is, I'd work 14 or 15 hours a day at a gas station if I really had to, and spend all the rest of my time right with my son. He deserves it most.|`|EKL9JCL9aa	Well, since i did strip when my kids were younger...guess I gotta go with that. Thing is, I worked at a wonderful club where the "guests" were not allowed to touch me, and the money put me through school and kept them with a wonderful roof over their heads. Now Im a surgeons asst in medical school.....
VuUz8NgKaa	My day started awful, my car wouldn't start, and it was 19 degrees and my daughter and I had to stand out in the freezing cold to wait on the bus, at least we were all bundled up. The day got much better when she got home from school. I helped her with homework, played dolls, and we went out and I watched her ride her bike. We had homemade vegetable soup for dinner and watched a little bit of tv, she took her shower and is now sleeping.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	as happens frustratingly often, my day was fine except that the day of people i care about was not.  my mom is at this moment in the hospital determining if she needs surgery, my brother is recovering from the surgery he had last week, my dad finally recovered from the surgery he had a month ago ... and i never ever ever get sick.  what the heck is with that.    okay, that's not exactly in the happy boundaries of your question, but what are you going to do, report me? :-P    i like a deep forest green but some days i'll settle for a deep red.    oh, and with great effort and much practice i learned today to play my 9-year-old's piano piece.  my first bach piece.  so how about that.  i'm keeping up with the fourth graders.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	My day was bland, didn't do anything fun, and has roast beef, brown rice, and broccoli for dinner. Oh, I fought w/ my almost 8 year old over homework for about an hour.. that wasn't fun.  My favorite color is blue|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	My day was actually very good.  My daughter was in a great mood today. not that she is in a bad mood most days, just today she seemed extra super happy.  I think i heard I love you mommy so much at least 50 times.  for no particular reason.  my little boy has discovered the joys of being annoying while i change his diaper.  he gets great pleasure our of just kicking his legs up and lifting himself up while i'm changing him.  he thinks its hilarious.  i also got to cuddle in my bed with them while we watched something on nick jr for a whole half an hour.  i could have gone to sleep except the boy likes to poke me in the eye when my eyes close.|`|1s3nddaYaa	why would you get reported lol... my day was ok. then i get jealous and caused an argument with my b/f lol. i dont like females. didnt do much fun today, just played with the little one.  i would like more to happen in my life, it seems so dull these days. and get my ged and start going to tech hopefully and get myself outta this house. my fav color id say is blue. no matter what i say lol i will still go to sleep thinking about everything. Oh i have an appt Tuesday to get my 2nd dosage of the depo shot, and asking about social anxiety disorder, my son is hoping around on m pillows at this sec and has a ton of energy for it to be almost bed time. umm how about you lol/ if i think of anything else ill surely let you know. usually my mind runs a mile a minute about everything      ohj dinner was rough, had hamburger steak and mac and cheese and potatoes and some how ended up with lots of pots and pans and messes. and had a ton to wash. and bray threw his food in the floor lol|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If you're talking about the thing I think you're talking about, it didn't depress me - just left me thinking, "WTH?!" LOL Don't let it bother you (assuming I know what you're talking about LMAO)    Anyway, my day was great! I waddled around some stores and had a nice couple of hours without the kids. I sat in Boston Market and ate lunch by myself LOL but that wasn't too bad. Came home to my wonderful children who were happy to see me and made meatloaf for dinner. My son complained about the corn. You know, the usual stuff. LOL    We might take the kids to the aquarium tomorrow, we'll see. Should be interesting.|`|j2mRop0laa	I was tired most of the day, now I'm wired because it's about 9pm lol.  Just spent the day relaxing, cleaning some, spent the evening at gymnastics with the kids and then I took them to Subway because I was too tired to cook dinner (I think it's my sinus infection draining me). Finally got them tucked in.    An Okay day. :)    How was your day?

That question has me thinking and all depressed too. But to answer your question, didn't really do anything fun. I haven't started dinner yet, my husband gets of work late so I'll usually start dinner at about 9 (bad I know). I'll be making steak, rice, broccoli and garlic bread. My favorite color(s) are blue, green, and purple.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	why would you get reported for this exactly?    my day was fair. haven't felt too good. have a bad head ache and my baby is all up under my ribs preventing me from bending over. and my two year old son has been super whiney today. so its not been too fun.  i haven't had much of an apatite at all so i just had some mac-n-cheese for dinner. and some orange juice.  my favorite color is yellow. is a super cheery color and makes me smile!!    And I just want everyone to know that my husband is a US Soldier serving a tour in IRAQ! And I couldn't be more proud of him!

I don't have fun anymore, each day is a blur into the next one.  And dinner doesn't please me the way it used to, I still feel the need to eat a lot though I don't do anything to burn it off so I'm just gaining weight.  I like the color Blue or Green, depends on what I'm looking at.|`|EwNrlF8jaa	Hi I had a good day. Iam greatful to be alive, healthy, employed, and with all my bills paid for the month. With the way things are going these days what more could one ask for. Thanks.
K2jT1z5jaa	hey    yes so possible.i thought in pregnancy constipation was the sign. i was really wrong i had the opposite.  & both. So it can be.    God bless x all the best|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	it didn't happen to me but then again I was lucky and escaped morning sickness all together. Odds are I would say you may be pregnant, so good luck and keep us updated.|`|FSPAKELyaa	yes i have had nausea and diahorrea, i wasnt pregnant tho, just a little ill|`|Hl76oPn5aa	You could be sick but just to make sure go to the doctor and take a pregnancy test i suggest to go to the doctor even if the test is negative because the test could always be wrong!!!|`|WI5KmVRdaa	when i was pregnant i did get the runs in the beginning and also i did wake up at night being sick to my stomach so wait to see if you get your period or not then go from there good luck!|`|nluNSDI4aa	Its possible, i have to do  2's a lot so you could be.
nE7KqaSZaa	You definitely could be ovulating, therefore be careful when you have sex if you don't want your little ones to be too close in age.  (I couldn't imagine another one quite yet)|`|tdHIR9cLaa	I Started my period 8 weeks after having my son and i am exclusively breastfeeding.... i dont think that you have caused the spotting by working out... i just think its your old friend saying hello again lol... good luck....|`|AA11029380	Breast feeding does not always stop you from ovulating.  It also will not keep you from getting pregnant.  It just lowers the chances.  I have a friend who was breastfeeding and had a baby in Jan. and Oct. of the same year.|`|awRNr2VMaa	yes you have started your period... everyone starts at a new time. Its a wives tale that you cannot get pregnant while breastfeeding once your period comes you still ovulate. Chances are less while breastfeeding but you can still get pregnant|`|cen8SIssaa	yes that is very normal....    i believe i started spotting around that same time as well. there is always a chance you may get pregnant especially with now your spotting.    doctors and experts say that breastfeeding lowers your chances of getting pregnant but nothing is full proof. so just be careful if you do not want to have another just yet.    Congratulations and great luck to you guys!
ZSSUfSXwaa	Well that's a tough one... how much does your son weigh? If he's over 40lbs he should be OK where he is.   Im in Canada and the laws here also state that a child needs to be in a front facing carseat-with a 5 point harness till 4yrs old and 40lbs... but a lot of people switch them early just when they hit the weight limit.  And then kids are supposed to be in a booster till age 8.   Yes sometimes we dont know our laws! My sister just had her second baby after 5 and a bit years from her first one and she found out through the midwife that infant car seats EXPIRE!!! She had bought a new Peg car seat when her son was born and he really never used it much, he didnt like it. So she switched him to a convertible one. Anyhow... when she went to check her car seat it was EXPIRED!! They expire after 5 yrs of the manufacturing date.   So she had to buy a new infant car seat to be able to leave the hospital with her new baby. Her "old" car seat was in perfect condition used for a few months and only in her car.    I didnt even know that infant car seats had an expiration date... we gotta keep uptodate!|`|cac865c179ceb4eff0ef0455af0f0d5faa	-REAR-FACING SEATS in the back seat from birth to at least 1 year old and at least 20 pounds.  -FORWARD-FACING TODDLER SEATS in the back seat from age 1 and 20 pounds to about age 4 and 40 pounds.  -Booster Seats  BOOSTER SEATS in the back seat from about age 4 to at least age 8, unless 4'9" tall.  -Safety Seats  SAFETY BELTS at age 8 and older or taller than 4'9". All children age 12 and under should ride in the back seat.|`|BAJd8raoaa	Mine's four and has to be in hers one more year (in MS).  Although it's unlikely you'll get ticketed for it - as long as they are in SOME kind of child harnessing device - if the cop doesn't like you, you may.|`|3gDiRoNwaa	In my state they have to be in a car seat for a year or 40 lbs which ever comes first and they have to be in a booster until they are 8 or 80lbs which ever cums first.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	In Kentucky they want the baby in a back facing infant seat until they are one year old and at least 20lbs. Then they can go front facing. They must be in a booster seat until they are 5 or 50lbs.
l7vDiKDzaa	Perhaps she is tired or stressed.  Just talk to her and tell her to use her words instead fo crying so that you can help her feel better.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Anxiety issues which are no fault of your parenting.|`|MV2q89Fiaa	does she need a counceler?? Or is she hitting puberty at an extremely young age?????????????????????????????????????|`|RUuQ3syDaa	thats not right....    take to a doctor, i doubt anyone on yahoo answers is gonna give any expert advice, which you need|`|zedSeGxjaa	Omg the above answers could not be stupider! (Regarding her starting puberty at FOUR)    Is she having problems at school? Is there a bully picking on her she's afraid to talk to you about? Is there something more adult going on with any family members, with them touching her in inappropriate ways?    Is she having night terrors and they just come back later in the day?    There are multiple possibilities that could be going on. Maybe one day you should take her into her room and try and discuss it with her in terms she can understand, being only four years old.    If you have any more details I can cater my answer to adjust to it.|`|HFKr2vBsaa	She may be tired, lots of kids as well as adults have more problems controlling emotion when they're tired.  Just a guess|`|NNhaQk1Gaa	I find that children cry to elicit a certain response from a parent.  In most cases it can be to get attention but this doesn't seem to be that way.  My five year old nephew pouts or cries when he doesn't get his way and thinks that if a certain response will give him what he wants, then that is what he will do.  Children are not as concerned about their general surroundings or environment and making a scene will not matter to them but he may know that it matters to you.  In other words a Power Trip!  I try to tell my sister this and I hope that it helps as to avoid constant situations of him making scenes to get what he wants even if it is something small.|`|647e04ec98f14cb0162f876543076705aa	Sometimes when kids are developing in life, at any age they can't control emotion effectively. Laughing fits, crying fits etc. It should pass as she ages and becomes more aware of how she feels.|`|UQLHTT7Faa	Shes a girl....do they really need a reason to cry?|`|PRGNC4Bzaa	brat or early period|`|05ff5bb18eb4c096ef430ca99d7dad2daa	Kids just cry some times. It happens with girls a lot more as we get older too and enter puberty. Probably nothing, just something that hit her and she needed that quiet time away from all the other people to cool down. Keep handling it like you are and comfort her. If it gets worse, she starts acting out, getting in trouble then it's more than just the girly emotions. Otherwise, it's fairly normal for a girl to cry for no reason.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	I went from a 34D to a 36H and that happened within 2 months of pregnancy. Everyone is so different though, it's really hard to say how yours will do. Ugh, I hope yours don't get that big though, my back is absolutely terrible at this point!|`|MRAKrVvZaa	Hard to say, I was a 34B and hit a 36D...yeah...and when my milk came in, I couldn't tell you what I was...it looked like I had implants...  Have fun with your boobs!|`|c8df8677102b4aa018d49e13a3a22b65aa	mine grew 1 almost 2 cup sizes. and the 32 will probably be a 36 or even 38|`|f5udtuwBaa	i suppose it would vary but i went from a d to an e and just fit the e once my milk came in|`|xoM9a7Uyaa	Tough to say. I went from a B to a D, and I think they've grown since! Plus after the baby comes and your milk comes in, they say they'll get bigger yet!    Everyone is different, but I would expect at least a cup size, maybe even two or more!|`|KVq8QLqYaa	well im 5 months and mine went up 2 cup sizes already.. they're suppose to get a lot bigger by the end of the pregnancy also... so it kind of depends on you but expect 2-4 cups bigger|`|cFSpYoDfaa	All depends on the woman. I was an 34A before being pregnant and now I'm a 36C. It will vary and I can say from experience that your boobs may not necessarily go back to the same size. I kept my C's :) So you may go up to 2 or 3 sizes. When they are engorged, they are even bigger. (mine looked like big porn stars' boobs)|`|TyPrPrIBaa	I was a 34 B when I got pregnant.. Now I'm a 34 C. So my boobs have increased a cup size and I am only 10 weeks.|`|Klk25W7Gaa	I can't guess how much or how little your boobs will grow because it all depends on the person.  I personally only grew about 1 cup size.  I was a 34b just before I got pregnant.  After I had my son and my milk came in, I was in a 36c.  Once I stopped breastfeeding I went back down to a 36b.  Still trying to lose some pregnancy weight, but maybe someday I'll be back to 34...  Although I do miss the bigger boobs, lol.|`|MthIvBZ3aa	uh they definitely got bigger for me.  i was spilling out of my pre-baby bras.  i didn't think i was going to get that big so i didn't buy any new bras.  but my mom did for me and i just kept thinking ' i won't need these.' around 7 months i was probably 1 cups bigger and it was obvious.  i got comments from friends and my husband. after having my baby, my boobs aren't bigger anymore...just different..hahaha!|`|d2bb48f9b71a310e9462198117bdcff1aa	depends if u breast feed or not if u do they will an wont go back to normal size but if u dunt they will go back to normal size when u finish nursing.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I went up two cups sizes from pre-pregnancy to after the birth when my milk came in with my first child.  It is different for everyone though.  I went from a 32 D, to a 32DD and then a 32 DDD (or F) afterwards.  This pregnancy looks like I will experience about the same change.|`|iMULlxdgaa	well its going to depend,  I imagine every woman is diff in this category..did your mom have pretty big boobs?  Women in my family do...so I always expected big "tetas"  lol  but I mean for the most part most women will get at least a cup size bigger,  some get really big and others actually lose some boob after they have the baby.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	I hope you don't purposely get pregnant just to get bigger boobs.|`|QFEFOaCRaa	ur an idiot, even if ur not getting pregnant why would this be your only question or concern about it.  pregnant mean having a BABY, a human being. dont be selfish.  oh and your boobs will get bigger, by how much is not really regulated|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I only went up a cup size but my best friend went up 2. Everyone is different.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	maybe 1 -2 sizes more.  My didnt hurt or anything inearly pregnancy until i was 24 weeks they started hurting and i relised a bra different. i went up one cup.  God Bless x    Edit :   Also they shouldnt get to a size where it hurts your back, But the belly will|`|XRLbqtUbaa	They didn't for me.  I was a double D when I got pregnant...now...when I started nursing, I think I was in an E!  They went back to my pre-pregnancy size after I finished.|`|AA11220327	I have gained a full cup with each baby, and they never went back down after my milk was dried up lol, good thing this is the last one i couldnt carry much more in my bra lol|`|biKMQ2I1aa	it varies from person to person. mine really did not get bigger but my sister gained 2 cup sizes|`|9vgZNLP8aa	Mine grew a lot. I had itty bitty little B's and now I have a Full D. It sucks cause when I'm not pregnant/nursing I still have a D it's just not as "full" so to speak and my boobs look deflated. :(|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	It all depends, in my situation I'm normally a 32B and I'm at a 36C now and even that bra is getting a little tight!|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	Hard to tell. Send me a pic and I'll compare you to my GF.|`|fMnzjULCaa	I'm sure your back does hurt w/ a 32 C. I have 36 full C's & they are annoying. Anyway, in my first trimester it didn't feel like they grew at all but other people said they looked huge (I still don't really think they grew). In my 2nd trimester, oh man! They hurt so bad (not hardly at all in my 1st) & they have grown probably only a 1/2 a cup size, but that's still  uncomfortable!! My husband actually just laughed at me putting ointment for breast feeding mom's on them b/c they are dry/cracked, etc. It's b/c they are always squeezed in a bra or shirt that doesn't fit them right.

Qn5mn99vaa	Your stomach would not grow yet, it would be far too soon. As far as the tests go, wait until you have missed a period before you waste money on a test. You can test sooner, but, the results could be wrong (false negative). Good luck!|`|cJfJd9yaaa	If your not getting your period for another couple of weeks, you are only JUST pregnant (like 1 or two days after implantation, but this would be classed as two weeks pregnant).  No HPT will pick up on pregnancy that early.  Wait until your period is due and then test a couple of days after.|`|5A7RmIH6aa	next time dont be stupid.and use protection.you have a nice wake up call. think about it.|`|xoM9a7Uyaa	If you haven't missed your period, and won't miss it for another two weeks, there is no way an HPT will tell you whether you are or not.     Maybe you're just bloated?    You could be pregnant, sure, but there would be no way you would know for at least another few weeks, and you wouldn't notice any weight gain yet.|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	If your period isn't due for a couple weeks, you would NOT be showing yet even if you were pregnant. The home pregnancy test probably wouldn't be positive until your period is late, or possible a few days before. If you could be pregnant (meaning, if you've had sex), try testing then.|`|YT48OTKzaa	yes you can trust the test you stmach might be grow for uther rease then this you could have gas you cold have somthing else wrong if i was you i would go to the doc|`|d2bb48f9b71a310e9462198117bdcff1aa	maybe but if stomach is growing alot in about 3 weeks u should really look forward of asking a doctor about that. That is how my girfriend was with our first kid but she had a miscarradge.|`|JNKiMSEyaa	If they came out negative then probably you are not pregnant or it's too early for the pregnancy tests. I would recommend waiting until you miss your period and test again or go to the doctor and get a blood test done so you can be sure|`|lMUCtrFHaa	I think you have tested too early. even the most sensitive HPTs claimed they can only check for pregnancy 4 days before a missed period. So wait till then to get a more accurate answer ok. GL.
WbJPQM1naa	Well, if you have good situation with housing and employment where you are, I would stay put.  I know it seems daunting now to have a baby without the support of your family nearby.  So, check your area churches for a MOPS --Mothers of PreSchoolers group.  You may be able to find support there from other new moms.  And you might also get some help with preparing for baby.  If money is not too tight for your family, maybe someone can plan to fly out and be with you for the birth and directly after.     I just moved from Colorado to rural Virginia last fall, leaving my family behind.  I was kind of scared, because I'm single and have four young chldren.  It was the biggest step I have ever taken as a mom and I was a bit scared.  But, I've found great support in my friend, who asked me to come here and who I live with now.  My kids have adjusted beautifully, loving our new home and their school.  So, it was the right move for us.    You have to weigh all the possibilities, and risks in making the decision.  I would say to trust your insincts too.  But, don't make a decision because of fear or instability.  YOU CAN be a good mom and have your baby.  First step is deciding what support you will find while pregnant.  Look up help with midwives in your area first, as they can be a much better source of education and support for you than doctors and mainstream medical system.      Read and learn all you can about having a healthy baby and birth.  A doula is a tremendous amount of support for women in labor.  They advocate for you with hospital staff, and are with you for the entire labor and will help you through.  Here's the link to their national website where you can follow links to find a doula in your area.     http://www.dona.org/    Good luck with everything and trust your instincts.  You do know what is best for you and your baby!  If you need anymore info or support, please feel free to message me.  Much love,  R|`|VEnVl264aa	wow thats tough... i just went through the same thing 20 in oregon with my bf while my fam is in alaska. Would it hurt for you to go back home? do you have a job in cali? does hi? would he be going with you? I would suggest you answer these questions, and that having your man with you wherever you are is something you definately want. I kept in contact with my mom and friends every day on the phone and via facebook and everything went okay for me.
bT4npA7Jaa	Preston James, I'm not sure of, only because I know a Preston, and I don't really like him, but I'm sure I would if I didn't know him and I'm sure you like the name, otherwise it wouldn't be on your name list.    Teagan Rae is beautiful, I absolutely adore this name. It's unique, and I'm sure she wouldn't have anyone else in her class with the same name.    Aubrey Michelle, I really like this one. Not as much as the other girl name though. I like the name Aubrey for a girl, but all Aubrey's I know are boys, so it just makes it all the more different.    1. Parker James would sound nicer, but again, that's only because I dislike a Preston.    2. Nope, I love the name overall, it's the best :)    3. No, I like this one too :)    4. Noah Kysen (Two middle names)    5. Isabella Breanne (Bella)    6. B/B - Aiden Hart & Avery Trenton; B/G - Keegan Gabriel & Ava Manelle; G/G - Rowan Madeline & Kiley Elle Camilla (two middle names)    I hope I helped :)|`|gu1sEQN8aa	1.  I love it!  I wouldnt change it at all. Cute and classic :)  2.  Yea its just a little to masculine..I like Talia Renee better  3.  Wouldnt change this one at all MAYBE Aubrey with Michaela but Michelle is great too.  4.  Brody James  5.  Hallie Marie  6.  gg- William James and Whitney Brynn, Holly Aurora and Annabelle Hailey, William Matthew and Vincent James|`|A7ovwP94aa	Preston James is a lovely name. Your names Teagan and Aubrey sound too severe.Change to more feminine names.|`|O4TtwWrXaa	1. What do you think about the names on one? Would you change them? love it, wouldn't change a thing.  2. What do you think of the names on number two? Would you change them? my favorite, so original  3. And three, do you like it or would you change it? it's nice, i just don't like aubrey  4. Your favorite boys name, first and middle. (ONLY ONE!) Jacob Alexander  5. Your favorite girls name, first and middle. (ONLY ONE!) Jordyn Olivia  6. Give me twins names, different for boy&girl, girl&girl, and boy&boy.  What do you think goes well best and why?   Jordyn Olivia and Jacob Alexander  Aaron Joseph and Devin James  Isabella Grace and Brielle Marie|`|k6HkVB5Yaa	I LOVE the name Preston, I really wanted to name my son this but my husband hated it, we named him Oliver.

I know someone that named their boys this and it worked out fine|`|9lvybFqNaa	1) Like Preston a lot. James I like but only for a middle name.  They flow very nicely & I wouldn't change them.  2) I LOVE Teagan, not as fond of Rae...I don't hate it, just not one of my favorites.  The 2 names flow very well, but if it were me I would probably use something like Teagan Paige or Teagan Kaine.  3) Aubrey is nice, Michelle is a nice middle name. The flow is nice, but not perfect. maybe Aubrey Callista.  4) Lincoln Reid  5) Salem Kaine  6) Lincoln Reid & Salem Kaine,   Merritt Rome & Aven Rook  Saxon Ridge & Bishop Caine|`|DP48dIxhaa	1) I don't like either name. I like Anthony Antonelli.  2. I don't like Teagan, but I do like Rae! Makayla Rae.  3. I hate Aubreyy, I like Michelle. Leah Michelle.  4. Christopher Joseph.  5. Amber Valencia.  6. Robert Thomas & Edward Mason. Stephenie Morgan & Isabella Marie. Max Oliver & Chloe Princess.  Robert Thomas Pattinson plays Edward Anthony Mason Cullen in Twilight..Stephenie Morgan Meyers wrote Twilight & the mainnn character is Isabella Marie Swann. And I just think the names Max Oliver & Chloe Princess r cute.|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	They all work well together, but just not my taste. I would change  3 to Audrey Michele
WbJPQM1naa	Not likely.  I found a report stating that the total amount of benefits given in Ca for a single parent and one child, including food stamps was $660 per month.  I have found that, as a recipient, that you will not get enough cash to cover the cost of rent in today's marketplace.  I'll bet San Diego rentals are higher than where I used to live in Denver.  I was getting benefits for myself and four children for a while, and I couldn't even get a one bdrm apt on what I was getting in cash!    Every state has different benefits amounts, so people answering here will probably not know, unless they actually receive them in CA.  I would contact your local department of social services and ask them for the answer.     Also, people don't know that with welfare reform laws, you cannot just stay home and care for you baby and draw cash assistance.  Most states now require you to be in an "approved activity" for at least 22  hours per week.  They will either send you to a short term vocational training program, or require you to do their bidding in community service to keep your eligibility.  They will, however, pay MORE out for your full time childcare bill, for you to work outside the home and leave your infant in someone else's care.  But this is how the lawmakers wanted it.      So, if it is not enough money for you to even cover your cash expenses, I would go to work instead.  You will probably be able to draw assistance to pay for your daycare bill, food stamps and medicaid.      Good luck with everything.  Navigating the system to get the help you need can be a challenge.  Please don't let those negative people affect you or hurt you.  They are cruel and unfeeling.  YOU are the doing the responsible thing right now to see to the health and welfare of your baby.  If anyone wants to criticize, tell them to save it for your baby's father who is  walking away from his responsibility!  Feel free to message me if you need anymore info or just some support.

They do not count your financial aid money so don't worry.  In fact, they will actually pay for your school books, gas mileage, and childcare while you are in school, so it is better to report your schooling.

6mhFHSRSaa	First, take a deep breath. Until you get a positive test, we're only talking about what *might* happen.    Based on the date of your last period, you're likely to be most fertile from Tuesday, January 27, 2009 to Sunday, February 1, 2009. Basically, sperm can live in your body for five or six days, so while you ovulate once, at a moment in time, and the egg must be fertilized within 12-24 hours or pregnancy will not happen, you are considered fertile for several days, because the sperm already in your body is ready to go once you ovulate. Both days you mention fall within your possible fertile dates.    All of this is based on when you probably ovulated, which is based on average statistics, not what actually happened in your body. We don't know for sure when you ovulated, but the average would be on January 30. There are exceptions: I'm pregnant now, and I ovulated 3 days earlier than the "average", which I only discovered when my baby measured 3 days larger than expected. That is to say that this is a guess... you may have ovulated earlier or later than expected.    For future reference, the three days before ovulation account for 94% of pregnancies, so if you had sex earlier and NOT in the three days before ovulation, you have a greater chance of not conceiving.    About cervical mucus:  Your most fertile day, called your "peak" day, is generally the *last* day that you produce that stretchy cervical fluid or have a wet vaginal sensation. It usually comes a day or two before you ovulate, and occasionally on the actual day of ovulation.    About why:  Yeah... that's a tough question. I am sure the people who try for years find the whole thing rather unfair. To take your question seriously, though, usually it has to do with whether the people in question have healthy reproductive systems - healthy, regular eggs and plenty of strong, motile sperm. If you and your partner are lucky enough to each have good fertility (whether or not you want it now), then you are, of course, more likely to get pregnant.     Best of luck as you wait and as you find out whether you are pregnant. Try to take it easy and not stress too much about what could be until you know what is true. You can probably use an early response-type test up to three days before your next expected period, so you don't have too long to wait. If you get a negative, try again in a few days (after your period should have come) to make sure that you didn't get a false negative because there wasn't enough HCG in your system to detect yet.|`|lMUCtrFHaa	You could be preggy. But there's more than a week before your next af comes along. So I would suggest that you wait closer to that week and get a HPT done. You will have your answer then. I know the waiting period is torturous. But there's really no other way now. But pls do use protection next time if this turns out to be a false alarm.
b71BxLUZaa	My daughter is 2 months old and we try to lay her down at 10 am and 3pm.    Btw I know how you feel. My 3 year old daughter never wants to sleep because she's ALWAYS afraid she's going to miss something. Have you tried white noise...or rocking her?|`|nE7KqaSZaa	Babies do need naps, and if you've got one that wants to see the world without missing a beat that makes it more difficult for you.  There are so many different thoughts about sleep and how to get your baby to sleep that there's no one solution.  However, I do recommend putting the baby to bed for nap time.  Just make sure you don't follow the same night time routine you've got set up and she shouldn't get too confused.  Even though she's tired, it might be a lot of work to get her down sometimes, but when she wakes up she'll be much happier and able to absorb more of the world.  My 3 month old daughter has one nap in the morning, 9ish for anywhere from 1-2 hrs, then 12ish for 1-2 hrs then 3ish for 1-2 hrs then if she's only slept closer to the hour at a time one at 6ish 1-1.5 hrs.  We start her bedtime routine at 8
QWTLw9DEaa	Honestly, I hate unisex names. Names for boys are meant to stay on boys, names for girls are meant to stay on girls.  There is only one exception to my rule, and it's one of my favorite names: Remy for a girl.    Ryan and Parker really aren't cute for a girl, neither are Matthew or John. Lol. I personally draw the line before they come. (Again, one exception, see above.) I really wish Ryan hadn't become so popular for girls, because I think it's a wonderfully masculine boy's name.    Well, Taylor, Ryder, and Phillip all are boys names. Taylor is probably the only name that I can truly consider unisex, but barely that. I know it's so much more popular for a girl, but if someone said: "Oh, yeah, have you met Taylor?" I would instantly think of a boy. I wouldn't name my daughter any of those names    Ha, ok, see, I was thinking about going in reverse too. Because you see tons of little girls named Ryan and Addison and Harper and Dylan and such, all originally boy's names (well, just all boy's names). But you don't see little boys running around named Isabella or Emily or Charlotte or Arianna.  I think why it doesn't go in reverse is because a lot of girl's names end in EE or UH sounds, which people see as too feminine for a boy. And girl's can "bend the rules" with names, whereas boys cannot. I don't understand it, but I think that boy's names should stay boy's names, and girl's names should stay girl's names.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I think giving a girl a name that is more traditionally a boy's name is more socially acceptable because most of the world lives in a male-dominated society.  Giving a girl a boy's name can be empowering for her, it often gives others the impression of a strong individual.  Giving a boy a girl's name on the other hand never empowers them but rather gives an impression of weakness...especially during the Victorian era when so many of these traditionally male names were suddenly popular for girls.  It has always been more acceptable for girls to be "tomboys" and it has always been a source of ridicule and often shame for boys to be feminine in western societies.    Personally I'm not a big fan of many "unisex" names because they just don't sound very nice on either gender.  But as someone whose given name is very feminine (Gabrielle) but who goes by a masculine nickname (Gabe) I don't really have a problem with giving girls names that are or were once considered masculine.  NO ONE ever calls me Gabrielle except when I am in trouble or the situation is serious and I generally do not introduce myself as such in person unless in very formal settings (I do tend to use Gabrielle when introducing myself over the phone to people I don't know and I do use it on documents or papers for classes because my last name both maiden and married has always been single syllable and looks awkward with Gabe).|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	no...you really shouldnt name your boy Ashley, Lindsey or Madison  and for girls dont name you kid Ryan, Parker, Dylan, or Tyler!!!|`|b4UCzrDeaa	I do. Especially Adrian for a girl and Aiden for a boy.|`|08kH822qaa	I don't personally like them. The only of your list I would consider using are Addison, Harper (I think Harper Lee so feminine to me), Regan (actually a Shakespearean female name so not masculine to me), and while I wouldn't use them, Brooke and Ashley have become pretty much female today.|`|ODZeyNYMaa	I love unisex names, said the mom of a son named Quinn Avery ;o)   I am curious too. I will keep an eye on this question, but if I were to answer, I think it is because that makes the name kind of unique, but not odd enough to be made fun of.   Thanks for an interesting question!|`|TUNvbXbgaa	I like Kaidence for a boy  I watch a 4 yr old his name is Kaidence John  Ryan for a boy  Ryan is my maiden name|`|tyqN6qBUaa	I've always waited for someone to ask this, because normally I don't have a reason to say "no, I don't". I'm beginning to see it happen with my fiance's name, Evan, and it's driving me mad, because I feel like once the name is associated with girls, it's no longer usable for boys. The same reason why we don't normally end our baby boy's names with 'a's. An 'a' at the end of a name usually indicates female. Sorry for such a specific rant, but it was the best way to word an answer for all your questions. Also, another for your list- Shannon, and I've seen it happening with Kyle as well, which I love.|`|Ep0CpwDbaa	I actually recently asked a question regarding this as well, although with little success. I personally draw the line as to how popular the name is with boys. I wouldn't use Matthew or John (or Ryan, Parker, Aiden, Tyler, Campbell, and so on for that matter) because I know many boys still named that, and naming a girl that would just be strange. On the other hand, Madison, Addison, Brooke, Lindsey, Taylor, and others are used more frequently for girls than boys now, so it is acceptable to use them as girl names. The difference between Taylor and Ryder / Phillip is that while Taylor is now a common girl's name, Ryder and Phillip are not. Even if I loved the name Ryder for a girl, I still wouldn't use it because it just isn't appropriate for a girl yet.    I think the names don't work as well in reverse because boys have traditionally been seen as strong and girls as gentler and weaker creatures. Nowadays, it's fine for a girl to be seen as strong, but weakness isn't a desirable trait for boys at all.    Personally, I love the name Jordan for a boy. I think it sounds very handsome and strong. I picture a handsome, easygoing boy when I hear the name. But lately it's been used so often on girls that I don't think I'd actually name my son Jordan, because now it's become more of a girl's name. I know one boy named Jordan and six girls named Jordan.    I think Madison and Addison both can work for a girl, since Maddie and Addie are feminine nicknames. Although the -son ending makes it look masculine. Avery, Ashley, Bailey, Harley, Lesley, Lindsey, and Mackenzie can work, since they end in the -ee sound, as do many other girl names (Kailey, Lily, Mary, etc.) Brooklyn, Brooke, Harper, Taylor, Skyler, Peyton, Reagan, London, Cameron, Peyton, and Logan work only because these are common as girl names now. Ryan I think could work if given a more feminine spelling (ex. Rhyann or Ryanne) although I don't particularly like it for a girl anyway. I don't think that Parker, Kendall, Aiden, Jayden, Kayden, Dylan, Ashton, Hayden, Campbell, Reese, or Tyler work very well, though, since they're still used for boys and it's just confusing for a girl to have them.    My opinion? I don't really care for masculine names on girls. I mean, I think Madison is cute, but I prefer Madelyn since it sounds sweeter and more feminine, and so on. I'm not quite sure how the unisex name trend started, but I personally wouldn't use a masculine name for a girl or vice versa.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	It depends.....I like Cameron and Alex unisex but I hate it when people make Ryan unisex. Ugh.|`|NuZjVW6vaa	I don't like unisex names.  My sons name is Hayden, and I hate the fact that it is becoming more popular for girls. In my sons class at school he has two Taylors, one a boy and one a girl. The girls name is spelt Taylah, but lets face it, they both sound the same no matter how 'pretty' you make the spelling.    I think the media is also and interesting aspect. Hayden Panattiere, Cameron Diaz, Cameron Manheim, Drew Barrymore, all seem to make a male name on a girl more accectable.   On an interesting note I went to school with a boy called Jody. This is considered a girls name, but I'm not sure that it always was. I remember an old black and white movie with a boy called Jody in it.|`|6okAIPIlaa	I hate unisex names.  My name is Jamie and I hate that boys have the name..... Jamie means the feminine form of James.  Also, people are using Evan for a girl name and that is my sons name and it means the Welsh form of John.  Pretty much anything anymore is being turned into unisex.|`|Tb3Yi14Caa	I think that every name is a unisex. I don't like the whole boy name girl name thing,|`|CSzDV3gEaa	some of those unisex names are cute and people think it would be fun to mix it up a little. ashley was also a boy name originally. i know a little girl named cooper too. not sure why girls name can't be turned into boys names though.|`|vGxipYJnaa	People generally stop using names for boys once they have become popular with girls - like Ashley and Courtney.     I personally don't like unisex names - and I don't think Ryan or Parker are feminine names and I wouldn't use them for a girl. I tend to like more classic obvious names.    Our son is named James and I recently met a baby girl called James.. I hope that name isn't going to the girls.|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	unisex names are stupid.

But you could try making up a more girl-like version of the name, such as they do with   Tommy-Tommi, etc.   So you could try something like making the name sound more girly.  I hope this helps!|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	no....i really dont like when people name there kids boy or girl names and its the oppisite gender.|`|xpUyH0psaa	i think tyler is more of a boy's name|`|ga2i6C5aaa	not really, no...

I do, however, think it is cute for a boy.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	i really like it but since it's a boyish name then the middle name should be really girly. like:    Tyler Anabella or Anabelle  Tyler Marie  Tyler Amanda  Tyler Victoria  Tyler Bridget  Tyler Abigail  Tyler Grace  Tyler Rose  Tyler McKayla  Tyler Makenzie  Tyler Elisabeth  Tyler Alina  Tyler Addison|`|b4UCzrDeaa	no|`|GXGh37YSaa	no sorry, Tyler is definetly a boy name, but Taylor was too until someone gave it to their daughter lol  who knows, maybe it'll catch on...its not bad, its actually kinda cute|`|QveBSjFSaa	Might have , about 10 years ago, before Tyler and Taylor became the norm.|`|7KDL9Wo3aa	Not really Tyler, sorry.

I might eventually tell people it's Taylor if they teased me or anything .. xD    Tyler Marie ?  Tyler Danielle ?|`|tyqN6qBUaa	Not really, no. And changing the spelling doesn't change the name. It just makes it more difficult to understand because it's mispelled. The name is associated with boys, not the 'y' in the spelling.|`|Y8bmn2BHaa	I think Taylor is better. Taylor Mae is nice. :)|`|poWyOGKCaa	loool tyler a boys name|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	It's cute! Personally I like it a lot better than Taylor.

5EiShLZZaa	If you are using more than one heavy duty pad per hour, you are likely hemorrhaging, you are probably anemic and dehydrated as well,  and could be in serious trouble...you need to go to an urgent care center or er as soon as possible (although you shouldn't be the one driving, get a ride!)  Good luck|`|acj9mB9Paa	GO TO THE HOSPITAL!!  My doc nearly let me bleed to death and I had to get a second opinion.  The second doc got me in for a D&C the NEXT DAY!!!

wZAeBisbaa	You should breastfeed as long as both you and the baby want to and enjoy it.  There is no need for either formula or cereal in the bottle.      It might be good to get your baby used to taking breast milk from a bottle in case you ever want to pump and store it for someone else to feed.  But that's a personal choice too.  My youngest never had a bottle at all.  My oldest did, because I had to work part of the time.    You can feed cereal separately sometime between 4 and 6 months, depending on when your baby is interested and ready.      Ideally, you should let your baby wean him/herself.  S/he will give you definite signals telling you when s/he is ready to stop breastfeeding. For most, this is between 1-2 years. But if you can't do it that long, don't feel bad.  Any breastfeeding is better than none, and if you can even manage a couple of months your baby will benefit.|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	I'm sorry but that answer will come one day at a time that is between your body and your baby   but have fun bless you and your family.|`|shBj5RElaa	most say bf for one year BUT do what is right FOR YOU, DONT BE BULLIED into breastfeeding.    breastfeeding was a NIGHTMARE for me. people claim their iq and health will be better, my son was bf for 5 months and formula for 6 months ( he was on milk at 11months ) and his iq is off the chart and hes very healthy    same with my daughter.|`|2N4j1ficaa	as long as you want to   ... if you need to put on formula then do so ... and no do not put cereals in to bottles if need food early then spoon feed unless your baby has a problem ... low tone  that comes with other problems as its lazy to put in  cereals in bottles and  baby's enjoy spoon feeding ...|`|SgOVFseaaa	It's up to you how long you breastfeed.  The World Health Organization recommends at least 2 years.    You don't have to ever give formula if you continue to nurse.  Baby can start eating cereal mixed with breastmilk or formula around 5 or 6 months.|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	you can breatfeed for as long as you like.  if after 6 months or 6 weeks you decide not to thats fine.  if you go for a year that would be great!  it all about how it works out and if you find it enjoyable or stressful.      never put cereal in a bottle. kids should learn to eat their food, not drink it.      you can introduce formula whenever you want, but if you want to breatfeed i wouldnt introduce it or a bottle for a few months.|`|680ce7c1396aafde36d344cfeb3d3d9daa	Hi , it is better to breast feed up to atleast 12 months or even longer according to your convenience. You can introduce formula after 6 months only when you have to go out with the child . But breast feed your child when at home.I have not given cereal in the bottle. Have a good time.    Julia|`|nrvKkcZoaa	breastfeed as long as you can, i found it so much easier, saves money and time preparing bottles and cleaning. there is no need to introduce formula unless you stop breasfeeding when the baby is under 1 year old, if the baby is over one you can just give them normals cows milk. putting cereal in babys bottle isnt the best thing to do as is will just clog the bottle and when u do decide to start them on solids its best to do it by spoon, as they have to learn to develop eating and by just putting it in there bottle they arent learning this. hope this helps :)|`|gurR7Dhtaa	I breastfed my son until he was 9 mo's old. And he really stopped his self. It was kinda odd. His ped. said that it's common for babies to stop on their own and that I was lucky. I had no prob. producing milk or any other prob., he was just done. I would say breastfeed until you or the baby (LOL) decides enough is enough. I think you'll know for sure when that time comes. I started my son on ceral at 4 mo's. I think most people say to wait closer to 6 mo's but I could just tell he was hungry and needed more. I have to admit I also added ban's to his ceral which your not suppose to do. But I thought it would taste better, and it did, and he would do better starting to eat it, and he did. Most people say to NOT put ceral in the bottle, but my sister in law did this when her daughter was 2 mo's old to get her sleeping longer. She is now allergic to so many foods, I don't know if this contributed to it or not, but it stopped me from doing so. My main thing was just making sure my little one could sit up well on his own. I did prop him in the high chair w/ blankets because he would get so excited to eat once he started.     Anyways, I would breastfeed until you don't want to anymore. And one thing I can tell you for sure, once your baby gets here, a lot of your questions will be much less stressful because somehow the two of you will find what works best for you. It's so cool a few months after my son was born it was almost like we could communicate without speaking. You'll never know a person as well as you'll know you child a few months after he/she is born. It's so neat!!! Your gonna love being a Mommy.     Breastfeeding can be tough to start out w/. My best advice if your really want to breastfeed: just do it all the time for the first week or two. And you'll both have the hang of it in no time! Personally I wouldn't put any ceral in a bottle. I'd spoon feed it. And don't worry about formula unless your baby needs the supplement. Hopefully breastfeeding will work perfectly!     Wishing you all the luck in the world.    Check out this site when you get the chance:  http://www.sixwise.com/newsletters/06/05...|`|l6TzxyN1aa	till it has teeth|`|bGcUdRkyaa	around 6 months, you'll know|`|7PNbjit0aa	Ideally you should breastfeed for the first year, but not all women can or want to.  That's ok, you are your child's mother and only you know what's right.  Aim for 6 months at a minimum and see how you go.  Only ever introduce formula if you plan not to breastfeed, breastmilk is best where possible.  Never put cereal in the bottle, it is a choking risk and can be brought into the lungs and cause aspiration.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	breastfeed as long as your are comfortable.  it is recommended to exclusivity nurse for the 1st 6 months.   baby no longer "needs" breastmilk after 1 year but continue as long as you are comfortable.  it is legal to nurse in public in all 50 states.  no cereal in the bottle ever.  its a chocking hazard.  get a support system or someone you can go to when you have questions or concerns - la lech or a lactation consultation or some one else who has been there and done that.  the whole process of breastmilk is pretty amazing.  your body makes the perfect food for your baby exactly when he/she needs it.  there is no need to supplement.  breastmilk is supply and demand - the more baby eats the more you will make.  its pretty neat.  do some reading about it.    also breastmilk digest quicker than formula so breastfed babies tend to get hungrier faster than formula babies it does NOT mean you aren't making enough, it just means you need to feed them more.  i have found w/both of my kids that feeding on demand was so much easier for everyone than a schedule.    good luck!  its worth it!
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Yes you could be, precum has sperm in it so you can get pregnant from that. Good luck.|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	The chances are very very low. Research has shown that even couples using the pullout method for a year have about a 10% chance of becoming pregnant within the year. So even though it is possible, its unlikely as the quality of sperm in pre-ejaculate is not very good. Plus, you got your period so thats even more of a reason to think you are not pregnant.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	pre *** still has sperm in it . and all it takes is one sperm to do the trick and if your ovulating at that time|`|nluNSDI4aa	Yes you can because i am possibly pregnant right now from the same thing. Pre ejaculation has sperm in it and a boy pre ejaculates often during sexual intercourse. It has sperm in it just not as much as a regular ejaculation would have. You can still get pregnant from it. It only takes 1 :)|`|AOfm8ey6aa	Happened to me before. 99% you are not pregnant, it is just your mind that is playing with you. I recommend to take home pregnancy test, there is still a chance and it will ease your mind. Me and my husband practiced this form of sex for a year and half as the only birth control. Doctors and books say it is highly unreliable, but surprisingly, it always worked for us. He did not like condoms and I refused hormonal pills. When we actually wanted to get pregnant, he ejaculated and it worked on first try for both pregnancies. :o) I think it depends on the skill of the partner you have. Some man can be pulling out late but they do not admit it. I do not think that the pre-sperm has enough of those little guys in it to make a woman pregnant. Because it never made me pregnant and we had sex every day for year and half. And I am very fertile.|`|xOvPuyfHaa	pre-ejaculation still has sperm in it. And pre-ejaculation sperm can sometimes (depending on guys) have stronger, more liveable sperm.|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	It is possible to get pregnant that way, yes, but if you had your period, you probably don't need to worry.|`|62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	No|`|xoM9a7Uyaa	It's possible for you to be pregnant, yes. When are you expecting your period? If it's not late yet, I wouldn't worry too much. If you stress out, your period could be late, and then you'll really be freaking out.    Use protection, or don't have sex, otherwise there is always a chance you could get pregnant!|`|XfJrheFnaa	you can get preggers off of pre ***.. its unlikely, but it has happened!    that is why you need some kind of BC|`|PqOThwVIaa	gosh for peters sake us a condom|`|TzLxCXm9aa	i am a mom of 5 lil boys and yeah you can get prego from pre but usually you can only get preg bout 10-12hrs once a month for most that is the 14th day from the day u start ur period...this is the method called the calander meth but dont count on it for birth control. but hey ive got a baby for every type of conterceptive!lol I believe if God wants you pregnant he'll put a baby there,either way
kjdKkDAkaa	You need to talk to the doctor first.    When you take birth control pills --take them as directed.  Don't skip them -- and don't just stop taking them unless you want to get pregnant.|`|VS8mactUaa	Start taking them the sunday after your next period starts.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	You should be ABSOLUTELY sure that you are not pregnant before you begin again. If you are sure you aren't, you can begin again the sunday after your period. I would let your doctor know about the gap so your perscription doesnt get messed up and so you can let him know about any breakthrough bleeding, etc. Good luck!|`|FYpWi4Vwaa	You can start the new pack after the first day of your period. Or you can wait to visit the doc., but if you plan on being active then you should start now
Xngq54vBaa	It's only bad if it gives you heartburn... it won't hurt the baby.  I ate everything when I was pregnant, breastfeeding, and encouraged my toddler to eat everything and both my kids are good eaters.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	It's not bad but it causes heartburn and it's probably more salt than you need in your diet too.|`|USQQWsumaa	i couldn't eat spicy food at nine weeks because it made me sick, it can cause heart burn but other than that i don't know of any reason why it should be dangerous
4d4bc6d418e7f55703a46a017910893caa	My husband gave up smoking... he had tried and tried before but he couldnt do it until we found out we were pregnant! He is so amazing!    He didn't give up having the odd drink... one of us should be having fun! LOL|`|cen8SIssaa	during my first he gave up smoking or atleast tried his best and he was never really much of a drinker...    but for this baby now he didnt give up either one, but i dont mind really.|`|k6HkVB5Yaa	Ya right~ I've never been a smoker. My husband is though. He didn't give up either. He's never smoked in the house, I won't allow it. I think his drinking actually increased as I was pregnant-no word of a lie. Men handle things differently, maybe I'm alone on this one!|`|BUCwZYnzaa	ha ha ha no he did not. but we dont drink and i dont smoke (cigs) but what are you gonna do it is worse when you are married|`|gh2FdQ7waa	i hope your baby doesnt get lung cancer|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	He didn't quit smoking while I was pregnant, but quit when the baby came.  He never smoked around me while I was pregnant.  He didn't quit drinking, but isn't a big drinker anyway.|`|vpHhryPWaa	I gave up smoking when I was 2 months along - my partner still smokes like a chimmney - he smokes outside now and when it's -40 out it sure does cut down how much he smokes.   Neither one of us are/were big drinkers - my son is now 6 months old  and I have not had a drink since last new years (oh my, a glass of wine may be in order) Shawn will still drink whenever he wants, but he doesn't get as wasted as he did before baby.|`|hGqQIusSaa	Before I found out I was pregnant my bf used to smoke in the house(which I HATE!)  Once we found out he started going outside, but never quit.  Now that she's here he only smokes outside and never in the car with the baby. (I hate when I see that)    I wish he'd quit though! ;)|`|Q7jMH5praa	Neither of us drink so we didn't have to worry about that, but we did/do smoke. I quit when I found out I was pregnant, but he didn't. We agreed when I found out that we would both quit but he didn't stick to it. I would just make him not smoke around me.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My husband has never been a big drinker, but he did give it up while I was pregnant.|`|awRNr2VMaa	Mine didnt either ... He doesnt drink much anyway and he doesnt smoke cigarettes. I dont really mind. I smoke cigarettes and he hates it I want to quit but just dont have the will power I turn into megabitch when i dont have one for a while especially now. I can get thumbs downs all day but Im not the only one who smokes while pregnant. I have cut back as much as possible and talked to my doctor about it he said if I cant quit to cut back as much as I can. I didnt quit smoking while pregnant with my son either. I never touch alchohol or drugs when Im not pregnant so obviously I dont do it while I am either. BTW i dont let anyone smoke near my son. I dont smoke in the house and never let anyone hold him who is smoking at the time. If I go anywhere and people smoke inside I ask them not to while we are there or we stay outside or leave.|`|ox0F6c8Daa	no. Well- He smoked but NEVER EVER EVER around me. which i absolutely hated that he still smoked...but i didn't nag or pressure the only thing I ever said was 'cancer sticks' and drinking...he drank during new years and what not but he didn't drink much at all. He would drink a beer (if that) if he had a bad day...maybe once a month? haha...    But since we have had our little girl he has been smoke free for ... 7 months! which is how old my daughter is. I'm very proud of him. He never said he was going to quit...it was like ever since we brought Junie home from the hospital he kicked the bad habbit. I'm very proud...because he had been smoking for quite sometime.    (One time i told my husband...at the time he was my bf...when i was pregnant...i don't smoke...i don't drink (occasionally but  not when prego.) i try my best to eat healthy and excersice...and i do all of this because our daughter deserves the very best. and i want to see her grow, and her children grow. i want to be able to stay healthy and active bc its the best thing not just for me, but for her. it might make him think. we all know that in our head but he might think about it if you say it out loud.)|`|RYmkmyuvaa	My husband drank a beer here and there, but never a lot.  If I pushed the issue he wouldn't have any.  He probably hid a few in the garage here and there when I was having a bad day!!  In the first few months neither of us had time to drink!  And now we are afraid to drink for fear of dropping him or doing something stupid.|`|VfTMkFaDaa	my husband didn really quit smoking but would not smoke in the house only when out at work. He would get home and brush his teeth too :) Its very important that the baby does not inhale smoke so u make sure that after every smoke u wash ur mouth and brush ur teeth and clean ur tongue properly. I think u shudn be drinking cause that can pass to ur baby through ur milk. Check with the doctor on this!|`|IYbg7nmPaa	he refuses to stop|`|6Wxcx7bTaa	my partner didnt give up drinking he did it at least 2times a week and i mean really binging so i had to look after him when he craweled home early hours of the morning drove me nuts my WHOLE pregnancy hated him for it, stil did it to up until the day i left him 27th sept. but he has cut back alot now drinks maybe once a month if that so i am happy about that:)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	My husband didn't drink while I was pregnant. I think he wanted to be 100% in case something happened and he needed to get me to the hospital. He never did quit smoking.    I never smoked or drank in the first place though, so its not like it was a "you do it too since I have to" situation.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	No, he didn't want to give up any part of the party scene, including drugs, so I dumped his a$$!  Sorry, but I may be carrying this baby, but where both having it!  Having a drink every once and a while is fine, but going out all the time, not fair!|`|FmC1TGm5aa	He drank less. He's not a big drinker anyway. He doesn't smoke, though. Have you talked to him about it? It sounds like it bothers you. But, that might be just "the way he is" and it might cause friction if you're not careful how you bring it up. Good luck! That would probably bother me, too.|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	No not for either but it never bothered me the only thing I asked of him was to not smoke in the car, he never smoked in the house anyhow.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	We are not really big drinkers so he didn't give up alcohol but doesn't usually drink more than a beer a week.  I personally drink maybe 1-2 drinks a month.  Same as you I have had a beer or rum after my son was in bed.  I have nothing against people who have a beer or two a day but personally I've seen the results of excessive alcohol consumption in my family and I think it's reduced my desire for it.      As for smoking he didn't give up smoking at all which I was not happy about.  I am hoping to get him to quit soon though for the health benefits and extra $$$ we can save.

Definitely a cute name . :)|`|hGKZsfg8aa	i like it!  but i prefer Danielle(:|`|GTja6ouWaa	I love it!!!!!! Also you could try Danielle.|`|SF1uPJZhaa	Don't really like it.   It's kinda dated here in Germany, was very popular in the 80s though. I went to school with one, she was a conceited blonde, lol.|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	its alrite... i prefer danielle.|`|tyqN6qBUaa	I prefer Danielle, but Daniela not terrible.|`|XZ8zBBpbaa	I do!

gxGsqNPPaa	Legally? Or ethically?    If you're asking legally, I'm not sure what the cutoff age is to not be considered neglect. If you mean ethically, it depends on the child's maturity level, as well as the circumstance and length of time. I was 11.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Wow, the answers you got were pretty young. For me, when I have kids, I don't think I would be okay with leaving them at home that young. 13 at the youngest. 14 would be perfect though.|`|10zaYXqGaa	Depends of the childs character. Some kids are calm and don't do almost anything wrong. Other kids can't wait to do something wrong and are always energetic. If the kid is well behaved, I guess that it can stay an hour or to by the age of 7/8|`|S9F6RUncaa	i was 12|`|xJwPKtX9aa	it depends how responsible the child is. the youngest should be 10.|`|4CMQuJgOaa	This depends on your state.     I live in NC where there is no age limit..if you believe your child is mature enough then you can leave your child home. I do not believe a child under 12 (and even that is pushing it) is mature enough to be home alone.    Check your state latch key law.|`|Ep0CpwDbaa	The laws vary depending on where you live. A lot of parents suggest 12-13, although this does depend on the maturity of the child. I let my daughter stay home at 9 years old - this is on the young side of the bar, but it wasn't for very long periods of time, my office is a three-minute drive away from our house so she could contact me anytime, and she was very mature. We also did not let her answer the phone while she was home alone unless a message was left and it was clearly our voice.    I think that if safety precautions are taken (making sure the child knows what to do if trouble arises, not to pick up the phone unless it's the parent, etc.), it's for a short period of time (like 30 min) the child is very mature, then 8 might be the youngest age possible. I don't think 8 is a very practical age for staying home, but every case is different. I think that as a general rule, 12 is the best age for 1 hour + periods of time unless the child is very mature.|`|V6vAvs0Yaa	Latch key laws vary from state to state. However, I believe the average age is 12.|`|UK4rGTiOaa	emm id say anywhere from 10 to 12. depending on how mature they are. but i was 10 when they lets me stay home by myself|`|LnXeCC38aa	About 8 or 9.  I personally was 7. I was a very smart kid and understanded life early.|`|xQYxSvYraa	12 or 13..i was left home younger then that but thats cuz my mom was a crazy alcoholic..id say early teens just so ur sure they can handle being on their own|`|8JzimdBDaa	I was 10, but I was very mature.|`|in7qi4oZaa	Around the age of 14 years.
AA10624857	If the twin is the father, than there is no greater chance his children will be twins.  If the twin is the mother and she is an identical twin than the chance is also no greater than anyone else.  However, if the twin is the mother and she is a fraternal twin than there is a slight increase that she will also have twins.  That is because there is no genetic link when it comes to identical twins.  With fraternal twins, there is a small genetic connection to having twins because ovulating more than one egg is a condition that can be past on.  It is called hyper-ovulation and it can run in families.  The father has no bearing on the genetic connection to having twins.|`|7lZWoMuUaa	it runs in the familyy..  =]|`|8nvesSFFaa	No you have the same chance of someone who doesn't have a twin.  :)|`|91aHpMwWaa	Yes. Very likely. Twins run in the family.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	The only thing that increases a person's chances of twins in regards to family history is if there are fraternal twins on the woman's side (ie. her mother was a fraternal twin, etc.)    I have two sets of twins in my family and none of them gave birth to twins.|`|VEnVl264aa	Very possible. Having twins is genetic.|`|VgE6flwLaa	I always heard it skips a generation. Like if the grandma was a twin, the grandaughter could possible have twins.
91aHpMwWaa	Your daughter has to deal with this herself. Its something every kid needs to learn. Give your daughter the support and advice she needs but give her space too. Make sures she knows not to just sit back and take it. Dish it right back.|`|NoMajXUCaa	im tweleve and if my mom found some girl doing that to me she would call her mom and my stepdad would confront the girl and warn her not to do it again and inform the school|`|VEnVl264aa	Depends on the severity, if its just normal teenage nitpicky stuff, I would talk to the school and tell your daughter to stick up for herself. I know being a parent you want to make it all better but some things are just better left alone, kids go through this, and need to learn to handle things themselves properly.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Tell her to slam her back, if she is too scared find another girl close to 16 and have her give her a taste of her own meds..  Report her to the school or notify her mother, but most important and if this child was your daughters age I would say encourage your daughter to stick up for her self.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	i don't know what your 12 year old came to know this 16 year or became her friend but she should not be hanging around with such an older girl.  but back to the matter at hand this is a very delicate situation, you cant talk to the girl or touch her i would go to the police and the school and let them aware of what is going on.  I wouldn't go talk to the parents either you never know how the will react keep it safe go with the police and school I hope this girl isn't dangerous or anything.  good luck|`|tdNaZ9qAaa	Call the cops harrassment is harrassment no matter what age|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	Call her mother|`|FiUprYsvaa	Tell her you'll put her name on the herpes-alert website if she doesn't leave your daughter alone.|`|XpJykT77aa	Ask your daughter what is wrong.  Tell her to stay away from her.  If she goes to the same school talk to the school.  If not contact the police and get a restraining court order against the 16 year old girl.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Okay, this is NOT something that your daughter needs to deal with to learn to be independent or whatever. This is not a lesson that needs to be learned. Maybe if the girl was the same age as her or a year older, but 16 and 12? That's a very large difference in age at that time. Whoever this girl is she's b*tch and you need to get a restraining order against her, it's harassment for god's sake. Scare her with the authorities, she has no right to be harassing your daughter.|`|qR3MYSOIaa	Talk to the principal at school.  Many schools (especially high schools) now have a zero tolerance for bullying and will suspend the bully at the first offense.  If it escalates, get the police involved.  This isn't a job for your daughter to do herself, she needs to know that her mother and father are behind her 100%.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I'd love to help you, but if you don't give some actual details of where, when, and how this is happening ...then the help can't be very specific.|`|AA11674544	keep your daughter away from her....duh!
T6nmD3X9aa	It is very possible. There are some seizures that do not show physical symptoms. If you see a pediatric neurologist, they can monitor your child for a few hours and if he does have a seizure disorder, they will most likely find a few seizures that happen with no physical effects whatso ever. This is very common, especially in autism    Foaming at the mouth is serious because not only can it be dangerous from the seizure activity, but this also poses a choking/aspiration risk. You need to see your doctor and a pediatric neurologist soon, you do not want this to happen when you are not around.|`|eulMjLtPaa	For Pete's sake, call the doctor!  Don't wait for diagnoses from anonymous strangers!|`|OXNiEDROaa	I'd take him.  My son is autistic also.  He just started have seizures June of 2007.  His are in the form of panic attacks.  I took him to Dr McLaughlin, neurologist, at cook childrens.  He's on seizure mediacation now and is doing wonderfully. he's 11 now|`|yXiyhD9zaa	Yes i agree u should take him to the hospital. My son too is on the spectrum he is 3. It sounds to me he had a seizure, there is a book called Louder than words by jenny mcCarthy, its very good. Her son too is autistic and did have really bad seizers now he is doing great but yeah she talks about he struggles, its a good book. I hope ur son is going to fine.|`|bkoTtsh8aa	if you are worried, then you shouldn't be asking online, you should be calling your doctor right now. It isn't up to random people online to decide whether you should be worried or not. You are the mother. and it seems like he did. children especially are always very tired after suffering from a seizure. also, people do not necessarily have convulsions or faint after a seizure.  Im sorry if my first sentences seem harsh but its true.  I think you should have called your doctor when it first happened|`|zh24FDwBaa	wait a second who had the seizure him or you or r u crazy!! call the damn doctor girl...|`|3sPILuntaa	that doesnt sound good, i think you should be calling a doctor and not asking strangers online|`|CLB3nVx5aa	call the dr immediatly or co to the hospital dont ask all of us|`|bKkHW5lbaa	thats not good take him to the doctor's|`|8D6cBpSHaa	its a seizure lady!!!!!my dog gets them//u should take him to the doctor now..hurry hurry!!!was it creepy??|`|7NbUxMwPaa	Yes its a seizure because my dog has seizure's and when foam comes out that means its a seizure if he lays down and hes shaking thats not good a need to take him to the docter he might need to take pills for rest of his life!!!|`|l7vDiKDzaa	Ask your Doc, it could be significant.

816TYl4eaa	your no pregnant it just seems like you want to be|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You CANNOT have a period and be pregnant. Women who bleed during pregnancy spot or have a very light flow that they MISTAKE for a period. Periods are when you shed your uterine lining which would be no pregnancy. You are not pregnant. Not at all. Not a chance. You are not pregnant.    Take a test. It will come back negative.|`|PMoRxJxkaa	you CAN have a regular period .  I should know .  I have a 3 year old niece .  But most like you are NOT pregnant  but take a test to free your mind .|`|kwMA5I1iaa	I don't think you are. When I have heard about women that are pregnant and have their "period"...it's either just spotting or just one period after they find out. I have never heard of 3 normal periods in a row and not have any real signs.|`|phwivaqNaa	It is only around the first months period that you would have bleeding.  This would be implanation bleeding (not an actual period), which can be mistaken for a period.  However, it will be lighter and not last as long.  You would not have 3 times, 3 months apart.  Your not pregnant.  At most you could have misscarried and in the case you need to be checked out by a doctor to be sure everything is back to normal.|`|zSABr7praa	TAKE A TEST!  Having your period is a tell tale sign that you're not pregnant.. but there's nothing that we can tell you that will ease your paranoia...a HPT is the only way to know.    I'm just curious though..  Why would you think you were pregnant if you had no symptoms and your period????|`|p68DUZhCaa	you are paranoid. what you just wrote isn't possible u cant have 3 strait periods and be pregnant. i mean cmon lol you yourself know its not possible... why are you stressing? your fine ...|`|CuCrGDuRaa	It is very, very rare to get your period while pregnant.  If you are nervous though, just take a home pregnancy test.|`|i4zKc2bhaa	Use safe sex. Im sure youre not, and yes by now im sure you'd knwo it.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	Don't be afraid to take the pregnancy test - get one from a pharmacy. I know sometimes you don't want to take the test & the get a comfort from people's word but the best way is to check it yourself. It is scary but after you've done it, it's better.     I don't think you are pregnant though.|`|QYSsvqXyaa	You Can!!!! get your period and still be pregnant! It sounds like your not though... Dollar stores sell tests!|`|1awiFO6paa	If you have had your normal period these past months like i mean   it has lasted the same (normal of days) of it is not light normal (like alwasy)    then u arenot pregnant  although it is possible to be pregnant and still get their period, but ithere would be a change like it would be lighter or it would last shorter    it is really rear though  it has happened to someone i know    but dont worry you are not  but just to be on the safef side   take a pregnancy test|`|bRwjqN3baa	if u have a gyno.....ask him or her, they'll be able to gave u an ACCURATE answer.|`|TGlWnFjxaa	its very rare to bleed for 3 months. Now if your cycle is heavy and is blood red then your not. People who have brown discharge or pink color blood mistake it as a period. have you had unprotected sex lately? Contact you Doctor ASAP. Cause If you were pregnant and was bleeding heavy and had pain in the ribs that may be a sign of ectopic pregnancy. Hope this helps|`|y3ytsrkZaa	My mother didnt find out she was pregnant with me until she was 4 months along. She had vaginal bleeding every month that she thought was her period and no symptoms. She was skinny and didnt get a bump until almost 6 months along. It was the same way when she was pregnant with my brother.
d71203d118a10dbd920ebc4a3ac6942caa	Try infant motrin and a towel soaked in alcohol on the babies back. See if the fever goes down then but I would have taken my baby to the doc on the first day if it had a fever. But try those things to see if they work.|`|FLpMShKNaa	You may want a secnd opinion, you didn't say how old your baby is but usually a fever in a little one should be addressed if its lasting 5 days. Teething has certainly made my son miserable, but its never given him a blister. If you are this upset about it, you deserve to be seen, I learned even a 1st time mom should trust her instincts. Call and throw a fit.|`|1eWDadlFaa	Wow, crazy. How old is your baby? What do you consider  a fever? He needs to go to the ER if they are refusing to schedule him an appt, this sounds crazy, that's way too long to have a fever.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	5 days of a fever is not from teething. He clearly has something else that is causing a fever and needs to be evaulated by a doctor asap.

kaqPSgTVaa	I wouldn't take them unless your doctor says it's ok.
ZaadvJAXaa	It's your hormones...  I went through it.  It'll pass.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yes of course. It's the hormones.|`|pR4nLjyRaa	Yes its normal! I'm like that too!  Hormones?  Haha  Congrats :)
VT24zOomaa	we talked about this in birthing class, the best thing is to not be freaked out. don't ask her if she's okay...she's not. lol.  also just be supportive if she wants to lay on the floor, be like, that's cool. and don't look at her like she's crazy, it can hinder birth because it will make her self conscious.    just be strong and supportive and let her know she' amazing and strong.    good luck, my boyfriends a little freaked out as well, but he's just ready to see his little girl. focus on the end result.    CONGRATS DADDY!!|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	My boyfriend was the same way.  He said he didnt want to see our son being born, and we watched videos too and they freaked him out even more.  But when the time came, he had to help hold my leg up and he wouldnt take his eyes off of down there lol....after wards he said he was glad that he saw our son being born.  He said it was amazing.  I think your mind will change when time will come, especially if you're in the room w/her...|`|fCcwvZS3aa	All you can do is be there for her. Help her by coaching her through contractions, and being her voice. Discuss with her what she wants, and let it be your job to make sure that she has the birth her way, to the best of your ability.    The birth of a baby is really gross, but it is the most awesome experience you will ever go through. Seeing your baby being born is a gift, and no matter how uncomfortable you may feel, you won't regret it.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I haven't had my baby yet, but my husband had the same questions for me that you have. I would imagine that all she will need is for you to stay calm and supportive. She will be in pain and most likely cranky. Just get her when she asks for her and reassure her that she is doing great and everything is going to be fine. All I would need my husband to do is hold my hand and let me verbally abuse him haha :)|`|hoX7hoINaa	You may be scared now, and when she's screaming, you probably wont find it to be scary. You'll probably be on a totally different mind set, the daddy mind set! You'll be excited and wanting to hold her hand the whole time, because on the other end is your son/daughter! Don't worry, you will do fine! Just remember what comes about at the end, the baby :) and be sure to keep her reassured, cause sometimes the girls get very tired, and having a supportive boyfriend to help them is something she'll definitely be thankful for. Even when she's pushing, screaming, and whatever else she may do, you'll probably look at her and realize how beautiful she is in that moment and you'll be glad you didn't miss it.  As for seeing him being born, that you may decide on once you're in there. Some say "YES I'm going to watch" and then chicken out or don't think they can handle the sight. So make your decision when the time comes.   Hopefully I gave you a little reassurance!?
PZlEtce4aa	If you thought or were worried about pregnancy during the time, you may have a rare case in your head and body that makes you think that you are pregnant and makes u have all the symptoms.

I get those sometimes before my period.|`|p68DUZhCaa	idk im not a home pregnancy test. those signs can be anything.|`|G25VY8Anaa	well yes, those are the sign of a pregnancy. you should of never had unprotected sex in the first place!|`|F0kjf1j8aa	could be early signs, I would wait till feb 11 to make sure then take a test  sometimes just stress could take a toll on your body

I guess I like Leonardo Alexander more.|`|HFhZc7BAaa	I like Leonardo better because it can be shortened to Leo which I think is cute for a boy and strong for an adult
ZtuLKde8aa	People determine beauty. Normally, groups of people decide what is beautiful, and the largest group wins.    Hence, why skinny people are considered beautiful today and why chubby people were considered beautiful during Roman times.|`|Nn63rf9Eaa	personal preference, everyone likes different things, but it's usually based on personality, you could be the prettiest person alive and have the worst personality ever and there would be tonnes of people who would never be able to find that person attractive.
n4KoinUpaa	I was born in South Africa. I'm a white guy, yeah, but so many people assume I'm the racist because of that, despite how many whites protested alongside the black population (I will not call black Africans "African American", they are African, but technically so am I), including my family (They've been shot at, hit with riot hoses, etc). It's a rather ironic discrimination in my eyes. Probably doesn't help that I was born with a cleft pallet and have rather visible scaring, but hey, whatever.    Anyway,    1) An African American man has difficulty obtaining an occupation simply because many white Americans feel "uncomfortable" around an employee who is a minority?    Yes, I do consider that racist, if they were uncomfortable with the fact that they were a minority.    2) An Asian is expected to be intelligent just based off of stereotypes?    That is racist. I've known smart Asians, thick Asians, and average Asians. Same goes for any other racial group I've met. Any stereotype, be it positive or negative, is still a racially based discrimination.    3) An African American is expected to be athletic just based off of stereotypes?    Again, racist. The origin of most African American stereotypes was based on animals (Both positive and negative), to make slave owners feel less guilty about degrading them. I known a very good swimmer who was African-American. I know a white girl who isn't very tall who is excellent as basketball.    4) A Hispanic is expected to be illegal just based off of stereotypes?    Maybe it's because I've never lived in the U.S, but I've yet to encounter anyone who assumed Hispanics are illegal immigrants. I have however, encountered people who consider people from Pakistan illegal (Which would be the English equivalent), or from Asia (The Kiwi/Aussie equivalent). I've always had a contempt for these judgemental pricks.    5) Miley Cyrus is viewed as "only being a teenager" when she pulls back her eyes behind another Asian?    This question doesn't seem exactly based directly on race. Yes, some of my fellow teens do pull their eyes back. All but one do this as a mockery of Asians. The one who doesn't do it as a mockery claims that if he does it just right, it allows his eyes to focus on things further away (This reasoning comes from the logic around pinhole glasses and photography F-stops), and for some reason, it works with him.        Now, I'll admit, the majority of my friends are white, but that's because the majority of people in England, Finland, Australia and New Zealand are white, so it's out of my hands.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	i make fun of stereotypes so what sue me      i think you are being ignorant because you assume everyone who disagrees with you is white and does not have to work for anything.|`|2BhDBYDPaa	uhh stop with the NONSENSE...jez cant we have peace on YAHOO ANSWERS FOR ONCE!!|`|r39EDGhPaa	1. Of course that's racist.  2. I wouldn't say "racist" exactly, but very out of line.  3. I've never even heard of that being a stereotype.  But like I said about the Asian one, that would be out of line.  4. This one is racist.  5. Why are you so worried about it?  She wasn't the only one in the picture, why aren't you whining about them too?    And I adore how you didn't even use Caucasians in any of your examples.  In every post you've made to me you've brought up something derogatory about white people, and you did it again in this one.  Way to go, racist.  You act as though white people are the only ones capable of racism.    edit: I went to Hawaii and lots of racist remarks were made towards me, from Asians.

I've done it before.|`|RAgWVuu4aa	1) An African American man has difficulty obtaining an occupation simply because many white Americans feel "uncomfortable" around an employee who is a minority?    - I wouldn't consider that racist unless the person didn't like that race...People can be perfectly fine with people of other races, but still feel uncomfortable for various reasons...    2) An Asian is expected to be intelligent just based off of stereotypes?    - That's not racist...The person is just ignorant, not racist...    3) An African American is expected to be athletic just based off of stereotypes?    - That's not racist since that is also because of ignorance...You don't have to be racist to think that...    4) A Hispanic is expected to be illegal just based off of stereotypes?    - It's racist if you dislike Mexicans and insult them based on what some people do...    5) Miley Cyrus is viewed as "only being a teenager" when she pulls back her eyes behind another Asian?    - That's just fooling around...Maybe it was a bit inappropriate, but it doesn't means she's racist...        Also, there definitely IS obvious racism against white people...At least ignorant comments from people who aren't racist...Just look on TV...Even in cartoons...I won't name the shows because I don't want to offend anyone, but...Just watch for it on TV...    By the way, it's not like white people are the only people who have people of different backgrounds with the same skin colour...Germans and French are different, just as different Africans are different, Asians are different, and so on...Who says Miley Cyrus was being racist towards Asians? Isn't that hard since we don't know if he was Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, etc.? No...    Your argument is weak...|`|k1zn8nBWaa	1.yes  2.yes  3.yes  4.yes  5.What i don't get that one    Im, so sure that I'm not a racist cause my cureent girlfriend is, white.|`|mpq95NF9aa	Quit ripping on white people. What do you want, an apology from white people for being white? There's more of us in America. So what? If I went to Japan I would be a minority and some people would probably make fun of me because of it. People are always going to be ignorant. There's a stereotype that anyone who wears thick glasses and plays Dungeons and Dragons is a nerd too, but that doesn't mean it's true. But people don't get all up-in-arms about it. Just chill out. And other than the last one, I think the things you posted could be considered racist in many instances. But I didn't ask to be born white and I'm not about to start feeling guilty because I'm in the racial majority. I could have just as easily been born into a smaller ethnic group.|`|e1jqOCEUaa	I'm white, but I've got lots of black friends. Also every question you have up there is racist. I hate people like that. It's ridiculous! I hate how ignorant people are sometimes.|`|2xAfgcNwaa	allllll yes.|`|IZtd0kBiaa	no  maybe  TRUE!!  hell no im hispanic  who cares?|`|coVZ1uqCaa	1. Obviously.  2. Yes.  3. Yes.  4. I find this racist & stereotyping.  5. Wow, definitely racist.     -----|`|FiUprYsvaa	I just looked at the damn picture.   All the americans are slanting their eyes...Do you see what the asian kid is doing???    He is making his eyes wide and open like non-asians.     OMFG People!!    http://www.tmz.com/2009/02/02/asian-grou...      Look, there it is.     They aren't being racist, they aren't being rude, they just don't that the PC stick crammed way up there.      And should we white people be offended because the asian kid has his eyes wide open??    I'm not.
yrDqtazLaa	The sharp vaginal pains are normal, I had those and yes, they hurt really bad. The best thing I can tell you to do is lay down on your side (if you can) and put a big cushion or fold a pillow between your legs to relieve some of the pressure down there, that's the only thing that remotely helped me. You don't have much further to go, I know you must be getting antsy, LOL. Good luck!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    it is normal. but if it gets to the point where its really reg need to go to the hospital. Definitely let yor carer kno.    God bless x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Call your doctor's office tomorrow and ask the nurse. :)|`|F8iyUqJBaa	All perfectly normal.  Just your body's way of getting ready.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	yes its all normal the sharp pains is probaly the baby head on nerves and pressing on your cervix combined with your cervix changing,thinning dilating.....and your contractions sound like normal braxton hicks...some are unnoticable and some are quite painful....and yes your stomach can or will get hard with either.....
Z7V7AbBQaa	This is a common problem with avent bottle. Have you tried loosening the nipple ring a bit  that usually helps.When done up too tight the base of the nipple wrinkles ans causes a leak.    You could start introducing a sippy cup. All The babies I know were off the bottle completely any where between 10 months to 18 months .|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I use advent and they leak sometimes. If I shake it and it leaks, I open the bottle and turn the cover a little then tighten it again. It always fixes the problem. You could just switch but bottles are expensive so investing in a whole new set when your baby is already accustomed to a certain kind might be hard on both of you. Usually parents wean their baby off a bottle between 12 months and 24 months. Good luck!|`|yjXUE8bWaa	I breast fed, but when they got a certain age you want to give them juice. So I had gotten some of those Avents like you are talking about, and boy are they MESSY. It seemed to leak around the seal of the neck if you didn't out the top on just right. So you know what I use them for? Measuring cups for malt-0-meal. NO joke.  So instead of using the tablespoon, (since I make large batches of the hot cereal for my family)I double or quadruple the recipe. So instead of 3tbsp per serving. The measure is """"6oz""""" of dry malt-o-meal , and 5cups of water.  And when my kids got to a certain age they make these cups, here are some links;      http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...    http://www.goodforthekids.com/item/Nuby_...    these two are excellent places to get these kind of bottle/sippy cups. they have silicone (BPA FREE) soft nipple tops. Great for the transition phase. Which the transition age is between 6 and 9 months.     For now, don't put up with leaky bottles, if your baby is still really young my choice would be DR. browns bottles.(They are designed to prevent baby getting air bubbles and gas)  D I hope this helps you. God bless.|`|vJEatJFPaa	Had the same problem with them leaking out of the tops.    I use Playtex Vent Aire Advanced and I love them.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Yes my Avent bottles do this too. If I take off the lid and re screw it on it usually solves the problem|`|bd023cea955952a6366f0a9965ea13caaa	Uggggh, I HATE those bottles!! I cannot believe how much they leaked!!! I use Dr. Brown's now. She has 10 of those bottles and only one of her Dr. Brown's bottles leak every now and then, but for the most part they are awesome! She has done so much better with these bottles. I have only tried Avent and Dr. Brown's and the Dr. Brown's are better hands down. :)  I am not sure when babies stop using bottles exactly because my daughter is only 4 months old, but I am sorry you are not having good luck with those bottles! I hate those darn bottles.|`|Z0A86lEXaa	I had this problem with my daughter!  She was about 16 months when she stopped using the bottle so I did have to get different ones, I bought Platex Drop-in they work great! and you don't have to wash as much, always a plus!!|`|R0EsQapRaa	Oh I hated the AVENT bottles.  The DO leak everywhere.  I switch to Dr. Brown's bottles about a week after using the AVENT ones and sooo gald I did.  We've been using Dr. Brown's for over 7 months now.  I wouldn't use anything else!!!|`|tMxGi4hPaa	I had the same issue with the Avent bottles, so I just threw them away and started using Playtex Drop-Ins.
SEzIkGNiaa	Ignore her.  I am having the exact same probleme.  I am 16 and my 14 and 12 year old sister are taller than me.  Actually, my 14 year old sister has always been taller than me, since like the age of 2.  The best thing is to ignore it, pretend that it doesn't bother you.  If you act like it does, alls she will do will bug you about it.  And I know, its not fun.  If she asks to play dress up, just say NO, and ignore her if she bothers you.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	hahahahaha|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	get her a saint Bernard. And hide till she forgets about you|`|ZejwYamhaa	you cant be serious?|`|h5QywAxbaa	pulll the whole I've got 7 yrs on you so dont mess|`|fDXrRtkHaa	Ummm... Wow, she tried to diaper you??? Well, maybe you should go along w/ her games for awhile, (completely willing to) until she finally moves on, or you move out!
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Actually it does have to do with the pregnancy. I have been experiencing the same thing and it just feels like you have to get up and move or you are going to go crazy. I asked my midwife about it and she told me it is because the baby is pressing on a nerve. It is nothing to worry about, it is normal. Good luck.|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	Yeah its normal i had it allot when i was pregnant. the bottom of my feet itched and tingled too it's caused by the increased blood flow (estrogen)|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    yes just make sure you walk around and let the blood through the body.water intake should help aswel.    god bless x|`|FSPAKELyaa	i get that, im 33 weeks and i just sit up and move them till it stops|`|k9nLue0Uaa	It's normal to get that during pregnancy I get it every so often, just take tyleonol for the pain if it hurts and for the swelling. Or take a bath I even rub Vicks Vaporub on it lol|`|cFSpYoDfaa	The blood flow in your body has changed because of your pregnancy. Try lying on the left side of your body, that helps me when my hands numb as well. Unfortunately there not much you can do short of moving around and forcing circulation.|`|eryJKCpfaa	i have never experienced that b4, but i do believe it can happen while prego.|`|YUV9SNBuaa	Have you ever heard of restless legs syndrome (RLS)? That is exactly what it sounds like. However being pregnant can, with extra weight and fluid gain put a lot of pressure on all of the nerves and blood vessels to the lower part of your body. Your circulation surely changes when you are pregnant. I would be careful how you sit, no leg crossing,(when sitting or laying down), make sure you are on a soft surface and you might have to get up and move every so often to get the blood moving properly. Either way I would for sure bring this up at your next appointment if not before. Good luck and congrats!
AA10015577	Well I was 2cm and 100% effaced on the day I went into labor, but everyone is different.  I'm sure it may be within the next week but it could also be longer.  Good lucK!|`|iMULlxdgaa	you know what...thats funny because my doctor didn't really say that but she said that I could go at anytime, or that I might still be around in the next couple of weeks...I'm 90% effaced and 3 cm dialated.  I'm 37 weeks and few days.  I don't know what the hell is going on.  HAve you felt like really sharp pains when you walk up stairs or do anything beside just walk normally or sit?  I also feel like I get these dull pains as well in my lower back but they come and go on and off the whole day.  I also just got a cold..becuase I thought apparewntly thought pregnancy gave you super hero powers aganist these thing s and shared a gatorade with my husband which is sick (I'm retarded)  so now I don't know if I feel like crap becuase I'm about to pop or if its the darn cold.  I'm right there with ya!  I hope we get this over with soon.|`|Nm7Hy67oaa	Anywhere from the next minute to a few weeks down the road.  There is no time table for labor.  God knows I wish there was|`|V8wUAVdyaa	any day now!  Make sure your bags are all packed up for the hospital trip!! Congrats!|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Labor already started i would say if your lucky maybe tomorrow mornig or with in this week.|`|Jo3Ma2NOaa	no one can say...ive been 100% effaced and dialated to 3/4 cms with regular contractions for 2 weeks now.....at first i was dialating about a cm every hour and then it just stopped no matter how much walking or sex...but today they gave me the option for them to break my water or wait to get induced on the 19th so were gonna wait...and see if ill go into labor naturally...but so far nothing....but i hope you have better luck than me cause its hell to deal with!!!!|`|MsipL0Mzaa	its impossible to know,it could be tonite or it could be a week....im just guessing here but i bet your water breaks first......|`|ONO1XLLEaa	I was completely effaced and 3 cm dialated for 4 weeks with three of my four children and still had to be induced each time. The only advantage is that you will have less to go once you do go into labor, but it's not an accurate predictor that you will go into labor soon.
yrDqtazLaa	Your baby is up there in your upper stomach, that's what's making you feel discomfort. My kids were up there and knocked the wind out of me when they kicked. It was very uncomfortable. Don't worry, though, the baby will move back down eventually.    The muscle in your shoulder blade and upper back is normal, just stiff and sore from pregnancy. A warm bath and/or a massage from your significant other should help. :)|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    baby is most likely pushing themselves and moving around in there.  Also the uterus & baby still have another 11 weeks to grow. So body is most likely making room in the upper body of mum.    you should be fine. as long as you arent getting it too pain ful.    god bless x|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	I carried both of my babies in my back and I had that same ab 'burning' and cramping feeling.  I never di find out what it was.  I just assumed it was the fact that my abs were being stretched so much, and I was now carrying all of this extra weight.  I would blame the back and neck pains on the extra weight as well.    Carrying a baby is definately 'sore' business.  I would just make sure to get extra rest and take a nice warm epsom salt bath to ease your muscles.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	You're perfectly fine.  The tummy pain is called round ligament pain and that will continue on and off the rest of your pregnancy.  The back pain is from one of two things or both.  Sleeping (or not sleeping very well) in a bad position.  Unfortunately not much you can do about that.  Or sitting at the computer or desk for to long and not walking or mildly exercising.  If you had a midwife rather than a doctor she could not only explain these things to you, but also give you some natural rememdies and even give you massages on your next visit.|`|4lsp4dtRaa	carring a baby causes alot of aches and pain its a big load.   the baby is taking alot of room in ur belly and sometimes when they move around it will cause aches and pains there isnt much space in there.|`|uBa0tU2maa	Is this pain about 3 to5 inches below your boobs? If so it is your uterus. It practices for labor by having false contractions (braxton hicks) some people feel these fake boogers but some only feel the sore muscles.     hope this helps
oHO0XOQVaa	I had to go to a school with a lot of kids that were all rude and would get into fights and I was angry a lot of the time and hated it so much. But what you have to do is just accept that everyone is rude and if you respond to them with anger and coldness they're just going to be rude and/or not care about you. You first of all need to be a little more outgoing and tolerant of their behaviors, if they annoy or tease you, when you would normally become very silently pissed just laugh along with them and make a joke and think "oh god, i hate this..."  This kid that sat next to me in math would sing in the most obnoxious way that would make me so mad, so I just told him really overly-sincerely one day "You know I just love your singing. I'm in love with it, so damn attractive." And he laughed, and I laughed, and he stopped singing because he forgot about it pretty much.  After this, when someone is being rude to you don't take it. Someone rudely asks you to do something say "Uh, can I have a please with that?" But in a friendly way of course, letting them know how ridiculous they're being. Like, "come on now, I know you're not that rude and I'm not going to let you be."|`|uz8n7Vq0aa	Be yourself. Don't feel like you have to follow everyone's rules in life. You should also stand out for yourself and maybe tell the princabal to resolve the issue! You could dress like a snitch or snob to make it look like your an animal or whatever.  1 thing is DO NOT change school... it just makes you fell worse|`|D7qJ0c8Zaa	act like a donkey|`|7AYnWg3paa	leave and get out of that shithole...go to a school that challenges u....i know what its like to go to a "ghetto school" wherre everyone acts and dresses the same...and if ure not like them u are an outcast...they only know what they grew up with and arent open minded......|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	You're saying you're smart, but then you have terrible grammar hmmm makes a lot of sense. Get over yourself.|`|Gr0UGqZiaa	When in Rome do what the Romans do.    Unfortunately, they're immature assholes who really can't get over the problem. Do well on your schoolwork, continue with your fashion, & then after that just do what they do, (not to he extreme with fightin & drugs) just don't be prissy, or bitchy. 2 more years & yourgone.    If you can't beat them, join themm!|`|fb1K9Jlwaa	It's fairly obvious from the way you describe the situation that you think you're better than everyone. Maybe if you lose the "holier than thou" attitude people will be more friendly to you.     Just a thought, since moving to a new school probably isn't an option. Just so you know, you're going to have to deal with people you don't like all throughout life. Learning to deal with it and treating people with respect will take you far.|`|8vzUHPJdaa	you only have a year and half left and as long as you're getting As whatever. you're barely gonna remember these people 10 years from now.  but in the mean time try making friends outside of school  i know somebody who went to a pretty bad high school that's a lot like yours and she goes to columbia university now which is a really good college so like you should keep getting good grades and stuff.
ez7ZB3pdaa	i went through the same thing, well im still going through it...im now 4 days late and hoping AF doesnt show....can be hard...i hope it all goes well for you, and good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You still wouldnt' be able to test until the 11th at the earliest hun. Hang in there. I know the wait is a bit**.|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	wow you are going through the same as me. started my period january 1th, ovulated January 27th to 29th and and pinkish spot about 2:30 am on the 2 of feb. so we are both in the same waiting period.. best of luck to you.
SRzswqTeaa	Very typical, very normal.  Your body has been producing the hormone relaxin which causes your pelvis to open more for your baby.  It's painful, but should go away sometime after birth.|`|F0kjf1j8aa	the baby is laying a certain way as the baby moves and stretches you may have alot of different pains , when I was pregnant with my 3rd and 4th I use to have extreme pain between my inner thigh and vagina and I thought I would never make it through I had to put pillows in between my legs and it would still hurt,I would use alot of pillows if  I were you it can really help|`|yiHrJGz9aa	You and I are at the same place!  I am 38 weeks tomorrow as well. I hope I am understanding you correctly, and if I am that feeling is your hips spreading for delivery! The feeling is almost like someone is pushing your hips apart but only on one side. This is because your hips are becoming more flexible and pliable for when the baby is ready to come out!  Be careful because you may get this pain when you are standing up like I do, I have almost fallen over because of this feeling/pain. I hope you do well and good luck!!|`|AA12090038	the baby's head is pressing against your pelvis...in turn putting pressure on your hip joints|`|iMULlxdgaa	your hips start to spread themselves in prep. for the birth. Thats probably what that is.  I'm 37 and few days too!  Congrats!|`|IA1irLy7aa	yes your ligaments in your hips are doing their final stretches before giving birth.
fb1K9Jlwaa	Stand your ground and don't let him copy yours. Do you really want to be friends with someone who will treat you poorly if you don't let them have everything they want?    Maybe you should teach him a lesson. Do your work but then write up another paper with all the wrong answers. When he asks to copy your work, give him the one with the wrong answers and let him copy that and turn it in. When he gets an F, maybe that'll teach him to do his own work next time.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Personally what i would do is just make two copys of the Hw..and do one COMPLETELY wrong..and give him that copy to copy off of..then maybe hell learn|`|AA12005593	Tell him you didn't finish it.|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	If he's having a little tissy about not seeing your homework and yelling at you... He's not the real friend. Tell him straight out that you don't want him copying anymore because he's a lazy ho.    :O|`|GcgrFMuNaa	He doesn't sound like such a good friend.     End the relationship with him. He's not worth the hassle.  You're both seventeen, and you're right. He should be  responsible enough by now to do his own homework.|`|lTsPX04jaa	just tell him that you didnt finish it|`|U1ku2k4Naa	If he is always relying on you to do the homework and for him to do nothing, that's not a very good friend.  You should tell him that you now have a no copying policy, then if he puts up a stink about it then that shows that he isn't a good friend.  Although if I were you I would give him a heads up, the night before, and tell him he is not copying your homework again.    xPepper R.|`|D7qJ0c8Zaa	get a gun...,... and ya
F0kjf1j8aa	I wouldn't make your self go into labor, yes the baby is probably very healthy and fine, and they are right anytime  you could have it, but the longer it stays in ,the better 40 weeks, but if you are insisting on trying to have it now then sex is one way to trigger labor and walking is a good other way|`|iMULlxdgaa	tell me about it!  I'm also 37 weeks.  Ok well I walked with my first one (a lot) and he basically came the next day.  It didn't bring on any major contractions but the walking made me lose my mucus plug and then I dialted enought for them to keep me at the hospital.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Walking, walking, walking, and sex. But let me add that they baby is going to come when she wants. You can try to go into labor all you want but it may not work. :)|`|k9nLue0Uaa	spicy food, sex, walking around.|`|MRAKrVvZaa	There's a reason they come when they come! I know your anxious, I was too but old on! He/she wants to be in there still...Meanwhile use this time to sleep, you're gonna need it!  Plus that moment, when you go into labor is such a memorable moment...Let your baby decide, she/he will make his/her entrance soon enough....  Good luck!|`|uBa0tU2maa	unless she has to come, I would wait! Don't do anything to make your self go into labor that is almost a month early! The doctors already calculate that we are 2 weeks ahead anyway. Please be smart the longer they stay in the better do you want to see her get hocked to iv's? If your doctor said anytime he didn't mean go home and try he meant she is trying.    I have to have help carrying a baby and mine came out at 37 weeks and even though i had steroid injections for him he still went through hell!|`|TIbmRFLQaa	I took 2 tbl spoons of castor oil in hot tea, and i started having regular contractions for a day and then I took an enema and went into full blown labor but i'd wait til 38 weeks  cuz sometimes the weight is waay off on the u/s they give you for the baby|`|A5KbJEH1aa	There are so many things you can try,  But unfortunately theres not a whole lot that works.    Your bubba will come when she wants too,  and you just kinda have to hang in there,  It sucks doesn't it.    But you can try..  - Castor oil   - Brisk walk or slow jog  - Sex  - Spicy food or pineapple  - Maternity acupunture or acupressure  - Go for a drive down a bumpy road  - Swing on a swing set  - Bounce on a excercise ball  - Pop open an evening primrose oil tablet and place the oil on your cervix  - Nipple stimulation    Hope this helps.  I have tried most of these things though anfd nothing worked for me, i even tried maternity acupuncture and a lot of people i know swear by it, and it didn't even work. =(     Anyways here are some other websoites with information.    http://pregnancy.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Nat...    http://www.givingbirthnaturally.com/natu...    http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/...    Good Luck and Congrautlations on your little girl.
rM2hWRVJaa	You are definately not going to miss out on kundergarten. Really there isnt anything you can do until you know the location of your new place. But be prepared. Have everything ready. For example: birth certificate, immunizations record, docters kindergarten physical form and letter from her dentist. Then all you gotta do is call the nearest school where you are going to live and you'll be all set! Good Luck!!!|`|IBRNev8haa	I would assume that if you called the elementary school of where you are moving to they could probably help you out...or even try the school where you live now and tell them your situation they will probably be able to point you in the right direction...good luck!!!|`|oO4TUkVkaa	It does not matter when you register if you move you have to be allowed to enter your child in school.  You can register your child as close as a week before school starts.  All you have to do is explain you had to move and did not know what school she would go to.
HDqPQbxtaa	yes it did and it turned out my progesterone got out of whack that month, and the dr gave me aygestin for 5 days and that brought my af on, and ive been regular since. she said i may not have ovulated that month for whatever reason(in laws were in town), so maybe a check up with your dr will get things st8end out. good luck!|`|hHEMhPZyaa	Sounds like a hormone imbalance. Probably a bit off from not ovulating (it happens sometimes). Dr will probably do a preg test to confirm, then prescribe Provera (progesterone) for 8-10 days. Period should show 1 to 3 days after the last pill.|`|Mbuii5A4aa	This happened to me.  We took numerous pregnancy tests and hpt tests at the doctors and they all came back negative.  It took until I was 2 months pregnant for the doctor to get a positive because my hcg count was low.  They gave me hormones to help my count continue to increase during my pregnancy.|`|xOvPuyfHaa	It's probably a false negative.  Tell the doctor what's up, if you aren't pregnant, then something could be wrong|`|fiUqIyVcaa	You are probably getting ready to start your period.  It is not likely that you are pregnant if you have had 3 negative results.    Probably have a hormone imbalance, perhaps polycystic ovarian syndrome.  Stop drinking pop and other beverages with caffeine.    Lay off concentrated sweets for a while.  Also get a good prenatal vitamin that has iron in it and start taking in regularly.|`|wcdz3lIPaa	hasn't happened to me but I guess you will find out if your pregnant for sure in 9 months.|`|3MDY29gnaa	nope but it does sound like your preggers. Im happy your going to see a doctor b/c no AF since November? something's up!
A7cZtZFyaa	Your mom can buy you anything she wants to buy you.  If you are too old for a binky and diapers explain to your mom that her money would be better spent on something else.  Also, explain to her that you will feel more compassionate towards people you feel are beneath you (for example: you won't make fun of someone who messed in their pants).|`|IkkYOehSaa	oh no. Is this ketchup ed again???|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	shes ur mom she can do ne thing she want|`|cen8SIssaa	yeah i think that is a great idea! your mom is so smart!|`|b71BxLUZaa	Oh gosh, I was wondering the same thing too...Sounds just like ketchup ed ;)|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	YEAH that would be a great punishment and I would have you were them around wile we went to the mall and grocery store.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Yeah she can, she is your mom and your her baby
K2jT1z5jaa	yes. and its completely wrong. pray to god darling. tell him how you feel.    if its what should in your life right now. pregnancy will occur if not.it wont.    God bless x|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	Abortion, miscarrying on purpose.. same thing.|`|OoaZGumxaa	Purposely miscarrying is an abortion. There are consequences to sex, one being pregnancy. That's all I am saying...Not trying to lecture.    Or if you just had sex less than 72 hours ago..the Plan B pill.  Which is not an abortion, it prevents the sperm from reaching the egg.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	yes, its called abortion.|`|42N6I9tKaa	sorry but if you are pregnent than you are pregnent. if you dont want the baby get an abortion.     congradulations on your new baby???|`|cJfJd9yaaa	If you're "purposely miscarrying" you're aborting the pregnancy anyway.  Wouldn't have been there in the first place if you were responsible and took precautions.|`|haf7pWvaaa	if your past the day after pill (72 hours) then no........ either you are or your not.|`|BilLTGLFaa	There's no way to cause a miscarriage, it's a natural thing that happens for a reason, now if you are TERMINATING a pregnancy, the only option is abortion. But if you opened your legs and didn't use protection, maybe you should take responsibility for what you've done. Tell your parents.
61NKzPzMaa	Evelyn Rose is lovely. I like it.    Demi is a nickname. Ray is a masculine BOYS name no matter how differently you spell it.    Danny is a nickname for Daniel. James is lovely. Daniel James?    Huckleberry is awful.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Demi Rae for the girl . I don't really care for the boys names but I perfer Danny James.|`|ej51eWO7aa	Danny James & Demi Rose|`|GTja6ouWaa	Demi Rae- nope  Evelyn Rose- it's ok  Danny James- no way   Huck???????? wth?|`|bT4npA7Jaa	I really like Demitria Rose, Demi for short. I think that it is beautiful.  And for the boy, I'm not too fond of Danny or Huckleberry, but I love the nickname Huck, only if the longer version of the name weren't so silly. Maybe you could make up a long name for it. Like Huckson or Huckland. Huckson James. I like that, actually :)|`|5sYzlAjPaa	Evelyn Rose and Danny James|`|pLcUFBl2aa	Demi Rae and Daniel James|`|NCl7B7diaa	Evelyn Rose and Demi Rae are both really nice. I'd say Demi is nicer  and Danny James for sure|`|AA12257580	I think Evelyn Rose is actually a really nice name. I'm not that into Demi Rae.    Honestly, I'm not into either of the boys names you gave. If those are the only options, I'll go with Danny James.|`|4ZLEqSanaa	I don't like the boy names but the girls so far are good I would go with Lily, Rose or Bloom|`|DP48dIxhaa	I like Evelyn Rose, Demi Rae, and Dannyyyyy James.

I really like Huckleberry every though its a little strange. Huck is just fine. I think that James really balances it out.|`|A7ovwP94aa	Demi Rae is absolutely gorgeous. I am not fussy on Danny as I think it is too popular but that is just me. However I prefer it to Huckleberry reminds me of Huckleberry Finn, I think your son would be teased a lot.|`|XZ8zBBpbaa	I don't like your boy names, but Evelyn Rose is just precious!  =]|`|z5MURXDaaa	demi rose and danny james is nice    huckleberry is not.|`|FjpLk2v8aa	i really like the name demi rae..danny is such an old name and huckleberry is to unreal...evely sounds sorta old ladyish...i would go for somthing a liitle more wild..ur kids will like it better|`|7qVuZRHfaa	I dont really like none of the girl names;  but its your choice..Demi Rae is better!    And; Danny James
LdoCKo4Qaa	How about Sting Wrae or Cheyenne Apache?|`|ej51eWO7aa	cheyenne rae sounds better|`|bT4npA7Jaa	I love Kaylen, but please, keep the traditional spelling of Rae. It will be mispelled and mispronounced her whole life. I really like the name Kaylen Rae though. It's really pretty.|`|DP48dIxhaa	I like them both. If I HADD 2 pickkk one i guess I would pickkkk Kaylen Wrae.|`|6mm0lEWraa	I much prefer Cheyenne Wrae but I think its better spelt Rae    I do not like Kaylen though    this might help u make ur mind up:  Cheyenne means Speak incoherently  Kaylen means liberty|`|xpUyH0psaa	cheyenne|`|gu1sEQN8aa	I love Cheyenne but Wrae is just an odd wanna be cool spelling.|`|5UCiHZJmaa	I like Kaylen, but I would spell Wrae..Rae|`|XoNKECCKaa	I like Cheyenne better (:  But i personally think you should spell Wrae, Rae.  It's your choice though!|`|Zlz8ywIcaa	I like those. My name is Caelan(Kaylen, Caylin, Caelin) Ray. I love the name Cheyenne|`|VxhknQjEaa	I LOVE the name, Kaylen and Wrae is cool.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	I prefer Cheyenne, it's cute.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Cheyenne is a great name :)
BqqDJXkjaa	I am in the same boat! My daughter thinks its a game that's not that fun.   "she just sits down, stands up and shouts YEA!!! "  That is the funniest thing!!!|`|AA11138222	She will not potty train until she is ready. Pushing her, or forcing her will only make you miserable. Just keep encouraging her and suggest sitting on the potty whenever you change her. Eventually she will get interested. If you want you can read her stories about it, or get her a video about it, the Elmo one is cute! But the bottom line is it won't happen until she is ready.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I also have a hard headed little girl.  The first attempt at almost 2.5 was a failure.  She didnt want any part of it.  She would take her diaper off as soon as i put it on, she would keep it on when we went out but would pee all over the floor when we were at home.  she was nice enough to only pee on the hard floors and not the carpet.  I did start using a belt, (for her to wear) so she would keep the diaper on, it didnt work she would scream untill i took it off. uugh. she was tough.  I decided it wasn't time and waited.  Two months later i had a talk with her and took her shopping to pick out her own underware.  She decided the next day she was ready and she potty trained herself with only a few accidents, which happened when we were out.  she prefered to use the little potty for a long time bc she could do it all herself, she doesnt like to be helped.    She is very young and you might want to wait a month or so and try it again.  Since she is hard headed it will have to  be on her terms and giving her some control (picking out her own undies) might help.  Bribery and stickers didnt work with my daughter either, it worked well with my son though.  he is easy going though.    Good Luck!  hard headed little girls, are tough to raise but will be strong independent women.  this is what i keep telling myself to get through those tough times...and there are many with my little girl.|`|BAJd8raoaa	At two, they're just learning, so be patient and consistent.  When she has an accident, don't scold her, rather encourage her to use the potty.  It's not a short or easy process.  It can take anywhere from 6 weeks to 2 years.  I started chastising mine (mildly) when she was three and it was happening only rarely.  Usually because she had waited too long.  Only reward AFTER she uses the potty, and take her even when she says she doesn't need to go.  At least 4 times a day.  That's a tough stage, and you're going to be spending alot of time in that potty with her.|`|SgOVFseaaa	She's still young.  I wouldn't push it.  She knows how to do it, so the next step is wanting to.   You can't force that.    My daughter was going on her own and then suddenly stopped as well.  I think I was putting too much pressure on her.  Finally, my husband and I agreed to let her do her own thing.  We would bring her with us if we had to go but that was about it.  Immediately she started going on her own again.    If your daughter is stubborn and free-willed like ours, perhaps she just needs some space.    Good luck!|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	I would just wait a little longer to start.  she is still young and every kid potty trains at a different age.  also, get rid of the pullups, they dont work and they are very confusing for little ones.  they feel like a diaper which they have been allowed to go potty in for 2 years and now you dont want them to go in it??  to confusing!  just wait and when she shows interest go straight to underwear.  let her pick them out.  make it a really big deal.  then give her a sticker every time she uses the potty.  make her a little chart for her to put them on.    edit-my oldest daughter was very hard headed about potty training.  i knew that she knew when she had to go but she refused to use the potty sometimes.  now with my younger daughter who potty trained in a week at the age of 18 months i see how easy it can and should be.   i now know that i should have just waiting until my oldest was ready and showed me signs that she was interested.  i started with her at the age of 2 and probably would have and should have waited until 2 1/2.    Edit-we also had a potty dance. something like this   pee pee on the POTTY!  pee pee on the POTTY!  cause I'm a big girl!    sounds silly but it really worked with my youngest ecspecially since i was watching 3 other kids at the time and they all sung it to her and made a big deal about it.  she felt like a big girl|`|hRZFLRHLaa	I had a lot of trouble potting training my daughter i tried so many things and nothing worked.  I started when she was two it did not work at all so then i started back up again when she turned three and still nothing people kept telling me to get rid of pull ups and diapers both because to a child they are the same.  So with my daughter turning four in only a few months i decided to just try putting her in underwear all day for the first two weeks i was cleaning lots of underwear but i never gave in and she finally started using the potty and is doing great but if i ever put her in pull ups she will pee in them but never in her underwear.  Good luck!|`|9ufltMBtaa	it sounds like shes not ready.|`|f1d4c8878f111ed951da3717f057df33aa	pull ups are of no use. throw them away....just put her in her undies all day...and make a big heeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaaaa if she makes a mess on herself or carpet or floor....then tell her that is why there is a toilet built in each house......if she does poop or wee in the toilet dance and clap and be a real happy clown...LOTs and lots and lots of encouragements...this is how I happily toilet trained mine in a few days.|`|Ybq7kznPaa	Your daughter is very obviously not ready to use the potty. The worst thing you can possibly do is push this on her. Let it go for a while and try again in a month or so. When it comes down to it all children will do it when THEY are ready. But for a few tips I would have my son sit on his potty after every meal, and give him major kudos even if he didn't produce anything. I bought him his own little potty too. They have some really cool ones too! Pushing potty training on any child can screw them up forever. Good luck
xzMkUCizaa	it should be free if not you can look up a clinic that will accept FPACT which is a state program that provides you with any type of birth control free of cost (many people refer to it as a green card bcuz the card issued to you is green).   They can also test you for STD's for free as well as many other different tests like chlamydia and urinary tract infection as well as free pregnancy test with this card. This is in california you did not say where you where but you can research online and i'm pretty sure they will have either the same program or something similar.    Good Luck and i'm glad you are thinking about getting on the pill :D|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    Im pretty sure they can help you out.  god bless x     They are usually 30 at the doctors. i havent used them but my close friends have.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It depends give them a call and ask!|`|62vCoDPjaa	heath dept is on a sliding scale bc of income..no income..free!|`|VUIEnZpnaa	Some STD's are tested for free|`|cJfJd9yaaa	They should be free if you don't have a job.  Please remember to take them every day and at the same time and I highly recommend that you still use a condom just in case.
yMsuXYpaaa	If she has gotten her period twice since being with him, I doubt pregnancy. The morning after pill must be used by 72 hours after intercourse in order to be effective. If she isn't sure, tell her to take a pregnancy test. It could be scary for her, but she needs to take responsibility and find out!    As for the morning after pill being an abortion pill. The morning after pill prevents pregnancy. Look on information sites. If you are already pregnant it does not terminate or effect your pregnancy, therefore it is NOT an abortion pill.    As for the friend, what kind of guy is that? Slapping a girl? He was involved just as much as she was. If anything, I would be ashamed to be his friend. He obviously doesn't know how to act mature and take responsibilty for his actions! If you find out he hits her again, you should tell someone about it. It's not right, and if you know it's going on then you are just as bad as he is!    Sorry but it's the truth.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Umm.. you wouldn't get a full blown period if you were pregnant.    She obviously doesn't know what Plan B is.  It prevents the egg from being fertilized, she wouldn't even be pregnant if she took it in time(you have 72 hours after sexual intercourse to take it and have it be effective.)    I think your friend needs some sexual education.|`|lWXFP6xqaa	tell her parents she has to nd put that bastered in jail !!!|`|8vzUHPJdaa	she isn't pregnant! if she was then she wouldn't have gotten her period.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Well if her mom doesnt know she is sexually active she is gonna find out...As for that guy, he is no good and i hope she slapped the hell out of him for slapping her. She needs take him to court and get that child support and if she is pregnant he can get in lots of problems with the law since he hit her....She needs to let him go and let the law handle him...But in the mean time you and her can also try and encourage him to be in the baby's life if she plans on keeping it....|`|JAJVHc9uaa	Well, who decided to do "it".  If its the guy, the guy is in trouble, and the girl is fine, well not completely.  But if its the girl,  she is in trouble, and the guy.  Well basiclly, there all in trouble.  Its hard to deal with.  And for those out there, it all teaches you a lesson.  But your friend has no right of slapping!  i know I didnt help. but food for thought.|`|3MVv1uOaaa	Oh wow. I'm sorry.  Let her know the plan B pill is not an abortion, it prevents any pregnancies from happening but does not terminate one if it is already there.     Do you believe your bestfriend is the father? If you do, you should talk to him. And it is NOT right for your best friend to slap her, thats abuse. I'd talk to him about it if I were you.  And if she is, she is going to need him, and her friends. If she is, her mom is going to find out.|`|ZtuLKde8aa	That's tough. But still, try to comfort her.    If she turns out to not be pregnant, try to inform her that she should not stay sexually active if she does not want this problem to come about again.    Best of luck.|`|sCuumWVTaa	Well you should try and help her out. Get her a pregnancy test, if she is prego, and she doesnt want to get abortion, then she is gonna have to tell her mom. Sorry its the truth.
UwIpnN2Iaa	I heard my baby's heartbeat at my ultrasound at 7 weeks. They can confirm the gestational age.. it won't give you an EXACT date of conception, but it would be within a few days or maybe a week.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It should be close. The likelihood of having it be spot on is not that high. Every baby grows slightly differently then the next so they are not 100% accurate but very close.    I don't know where he is getting August 27th though. My last period was November 17th and I have a due date of August 26th. Two different nurses calculated out my due date and I went to probably half a dozen due date calculators online that said the same thing. Weird. Maybe he's going by your measurements. Sorry I just rambled.|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	They were able to detect my sons heartbeat at only 8 weeks. We saw it on the screen and it was 80 bpm which they said was normal for that early on. From what I understand they are very accurate in detecting the heartbeat.|`|ueDqd80daa	Ok this is so funny you're asking because I just asked the same thing earlier. I'm 6 weeks, 3 days. They told me there was no heartbeat and that I had miscarried. Come to find out (after much research, and of course asking questions on here) it's very hard to detect a heartbeat at 6weeks. If you're worried, just like I am, I would go see a doc. again. (I certainly am) Good luck!!!!|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	Nope, we can't do date of conception. Everyone's cycle is different. You can only guess what it is.   Transvaginals are very accurate, but the baby still could be going through a growth spurt or lag. It is just a computer system that calculates the date. It can't "know" when you had sex.|`|170b7e2476f78e0c5b6737427b428500aa	I was able to see my baby's heartbeat at 5wks6days.|`|7geLpG6Oaa	No. It's not always accurate. That's why it's called an EDD, estimated due date. Also why they will induce 2wks early or let you go 2 weeks over, there's about a month of leeway there. I'd say they've got it down to the week you should be due by now.
RPszYGXkaa	So sorry to hear about your losses...  I just had one in October.  I have a daughter already, and we are trying for another baby.  I have only had that one to speak of, we are still TTC.  I know when (if) I get another BFP, I will be ecstatic, but also a little cautious.  My OBGYN didn't seem worried that it would impact my capabilities to achieve pregnancy.  If you find that the chemical pregnancies are happening more often, call your doctor.  They have test to ensure that your luteal phase (the time from ovulation to your period) is long enough, b/c if it is too short it can negatively impact achieving pregnancy.  Best wishes and I hope you get a sticky bean soon!|`|3MDY29gnaa	no I havn't personally but my sister has had 2. and Now she has 2 very healthy beautiful girls with twins on the way! It's okay Hun it is all in God Hands!!!
iMULlxdgaa	your preggos...Its impossible to get a false positive!|`|62vCoDPjaa	i dont think 4 pregnancy tests would lie to you... one false i can understand..but 3 more?  sounds like to me you are pregnant!|`|A5KbJEH1aa	Its really hard to get a false positive,    But it is possible.      I took clearblue tests and they were positive for me and this was the day my period was due and they were correct.    I would go to the doctor cos he or she can do a blood test and that is 100% accuarte.      Good Luck.  Hopefully this was the answer you wanted.|`|ueDqd80daa	It also depends on the time of day when you take the test. first thing in the morning is best. I've never heard of a false positive! Congrats & Good luck
0Sv8PiH9aa	Well I am due in 10 days lol.. and what I am doing is lot's of research. I am also preparing by telling myself I am just going to trust my body because I want to go all natural. My coach (boyfriend) and I talked about how he can comfort and support me and I ask my midwife lot's of questions. There are tons of books you can rent from the library that can be a HUGE help and explain every phase of labor in detail as to what happens to your body and how you may feel. Inform yourself and get support from others and you will be ready!|`|iMULlxdgaa	omg no...I never took a birthing class in my life!  ButI've read books and spoken to others and of course YA! helps.  Since you got like 4 weeks left I would just research it.  Ask people who were pregnant before.  I got an epidural before and I'm getting one this time..thats basically my birth plan and my "prep"...I'm easy to please I guess. :P|`|MthIvBZ3aa	i took everyone's advice and enjoyed my last few weeks of sleep!  get as much as you can now.  i did a lot of walking and the last time i told myself i would walk (just because i was getting tired of doing it) my son actually came the next day.  i did a lot of reading to my son.  i made sure i had everything i needed for him because i knew i wouldn't be out too much once he was born.  but make sure you eat before you are admitted because they only fed my popsicles and ginger ale.  i had to wait until after i gave birth before i could eat.  it sucked because i was in labor for 14 hours and before that i hadn't eaten a a meal for at least 8.  but it will be fine!  just remember to pack your overnight bag with everything that makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. it will be just fine! best wishes...|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	i never took a birthing class nor did i read up on it lmao . and everything went great the nurses talked me through the pushes and counted and i got an epidural and it was all very fast and painless . which is weird to say about having a baby but i didnt feel a thing down there
eOUQ07mJaa	you can try to use a small amount of lube so that it doesn't break as easily  generally, they should be ok if used properly  all the major manufacturers have thin condoms|`|42N6I9tKaa	they break.....  they are all 97% affective though|`|62vCoDPjaa	thinner can sometimes have a higher tendancy to break|`|bf15d509ad8c8861312488ea09c8eb1caa	Use a balloon!|`|ueDqd80daa	um, it could break easier!|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I always bought Crown or Kimono condoms for my boyfriends to use.  They are very thin but strong and reliable. You can order them online.  Sometimes Kimono are in the stores.  Use lube on the outside to reduce the chances of rips and tears.
9Chvfjzfaa	whatever floats ur boat be a girl guy black white or green(lol)  as long as you r happy and satisfied (also having fun)|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Ummmm if you are not interested in the girl then let her alone..If you do like her, I am not big on lesbians and gays but to each its own and have fun...just explain to your son what is going on so he wont be confused....But pertaining to the loser boyfriends, all guys aren't the same, you are probably just picking the wrong ones!!!!!|`|tyqN6qBUaa	I'm all for it.|`|JAJVHc9uaa	Its really up to you.  Im not and probably wont be.  But if you feel comfortable then you van try,  its more a choice up to you.  Everybody has diffrent minds and all.

I know, thats mean- but just a thought.|`|R0YkIVlpaa	well maybe this could be the relationship you always dreamed of.|`|pcjOQDymaa	I WOULD NEVER DO IT!  im sorry but you do whatever you want to,  i would also NEVER judge someone who did.|`|3MVv1uOaaa	I think its normal.

BTf36bukaa	You do NOT want to do anything at home to try to break your water.  You can do things to try to induce labor, but if you somehow break your water, but do not go into labor there is a high risk of infection.  Many women go into labor and the doctors have to break their water for them.|`|iMULlxdgaa	I would not reccomend breaking your water by your self,  It gets really hectic after your water breaks becuas ethere is chance for infection.  You'll freak out.  I would just ry walking,  eating something spicy,  having sex to induce your labor.  You don't have to break your water to induce labor.|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	You can't make it break yourself without it being dangerous for you and the baby. Only 1 in 10 women experience there water breaking before they go to the hospital and some women have to have it broken by the doctor. But they know how to do it safely and correctly. So just hang in there. :)|`|AA11220327	to be perfectly honest with you, there is nothing that you can do to make you water break. Not safely for you or your baby anyway. Some peoples water never breaks naturally, mine never has, the drs have always had to break it for me when I was in labor|`|F0kjf1j8aa	don't try to get your water to break it will happen when its time for your baby to come you don't want to rush it and you don't want to hurt your baby|`|42N6I9tKaa	there is really no safe way to you and the baby...    congradulations|`|62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	Why on earth would you want to ???    let things happen naturally|`|xoM9a7Uyaa	Wait for it to happen.|`|VUIEnZpnaa	water does not break all the time, it only breaks 1 out of 10 births|`|YT48OTKzaa	nothing, it has to come neatrul i know you tird becase at this stag we get tird and ray for this o be over with but we have to let it take it;s course|`|a2S2BrwBaa	Why would you want to do that? Well probably you are tired and everything hurts. But be patient and wait. It'll break by it self or doctors will break it. Usually doctors do that.

It was for a couple weeks!!|`|42N6I9tKaa	yes this is very normal! after not having you period for 9 months a lot gets build up and it has to go somewere! =]    congrats =]|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	the clots can be as big as a toonie but any bigger and you should go see a doctor|`|jNqf8HtDaa	you might not have passed everything through but you need to see your doctor to make sure and make sure it doesnt cause an infection|`|W1p6LetFaa	I haven't given birth yet, but yes, I'm pretty sure that is exactly what is supposed to happen.  You have a lot of blood and other material to pass.  But if you are nervous, go ahead and call your doc.|`|4o3zND8Haa	well im not a girl, but this is scary.. i think u should go to the doctors office just to see if ur ok... be well friend|`|JNKiMSEyaa	I had that happen to me and my doctor said it was fine. If you are worried go get checked|`|d2bb48f9b71a310e9462198117bdcff1aa	maybe it depends if it keeps on for about 2 weeks then it will slowly quit,but if ur worried of infections setting in go see a doctor about it. Good luck|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Yes it's very normal|`|fiUqIyVcaa	Passing small clots about the size of a nickle or a dime is normal.  Clots bigger than that is not normal after 1 week of having a baby.  The thing that you need to consider is:  are you passing large clots throughout the day or is it mainly of the morning just after you get out of bed.    If it occurs in the morning after getting out of bed, then the vaginal bleeding pooled in the vagina through the night instead of coming out.  It then clots and will pass in one or two large clots and this would be normal.    If it occurs throughout the day it is not normal and may indicate that you did not pass all of the placenta when you had the baby it is called retained placenta and the bleeding usually progressively gets worse which is very dangerous.  You need to be checked by your physician.  The bleeding should have slowed considerably by one week post partum.  It should no longer be bright or dark red at this point but should be more of a pink color with perhaps some yellowish mucus with it and should not be any heavier than a normal or a light period should be.

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? You need to make it clear running away won't solve a single thing. Where would she go? Most kids who run away, end up on the street and end up as prostitutes. (http://stopsexwithkids.ca/app/en/) Tell her to either talk to a family member about moving in with them, or to talk to someone at her school. They can inform children's services and get her to a proper home where she'll get positive encouragement. Discourage running away as much as possible, cause it will only get her further in the hole then she is. ??|`|F47MyGDSaa	Tell her not to run away. Her age might be helpful? Depending on where you live, some Youth Service's give shelters to teens 15-17 or different ages, and they find them homes to go to if they don't feel "safe" at home.    Her sister is WRONG for not letting her eat. And her parents are being VERBALLY abusive, and it's not right. Have her tell someone, like a teacher, or counselor.|`|KaXHVcqbaa	how old is she. I would call the child labor people and they can talk to her and find out what is going on, she may get sent to foster care but at least she will be with people that love her. If your family also knows what is going on maybe she can stay there with you and all you can figure something out to help her. I would do something though cause things could only get worse. I have seen to many shows that some kids like that are able to commit suicide because they think they are unwanted and unloved. Talk to your family and talk to her or call people for help. Hope this helps!|`|zprMdpxZaa	well as a friend you should take her in your house if you want to help.|`|d67ULZQ6aa	Ok, your in a situation where your scared for your friend, and are fearing for her life. I've been in a situation like this before, but it was on a more serious scale. I think you should defiantly do something. They have child abuse hot lines, where you can call and get help for her. I would do it anonymously thought. If worst comes to worst and she does run away be there for her and tell her to come to your house. Tell your parents whats going on, and it will be a big mess but I'm sure they will understand. It's not fair how her parents are treating her, personally running away is never the answer, but if that's what she feels the need to do just always be there for her. And if you think things are getting alittle to out of hand don't be afraid to tell your parents. I wish her and you the best of luck.|`|Inc78M0Raa	Ask your parents if she can stay at your house.  If she stays at your house, ask your parents if they can call Social Services.  They may be able to stop the abuse.  (Abuse isn't only physical, it's verbal too)|`|3g1y1Ahhaa	i think that the best thing for you to do, would be to offer her a place to stay. and if she is underage she can file for an emancipation because her family is verbally abusing her. but then she might end up in a foster home.|`|zmbeIbx7aa	Yeah this would be considered abuse. Abuse isn't just classified as physically or sexually it can also be mentally. I hope you do go to someone responsible who will listen to you before she does runaway and ends up in a bad  situation where no one will be able to help her. Maybe you speaking up will help her see that she does not need to be treated like this and does seek help.|`|qOe0WX1laa	find away that they can get family counseling or something    or if their parents dont mind and your parents dont mind, u should see if she can moove in w. u|`|87Dne23saa	step 1: THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING YOU CAN DO FOR HER!!!    step2: its beyond your controle, you must call a trusted adult, a guidance counsler, or a parent    step 3: just calm down. this is not soething for you to understand. just tlk to her && comfort her. this is for a professional to help w/.|`|l1STgPyRaa	it is a form of abuse but it is one of the hardest ones to prove in a court maybe she could ask to be left with other family members or something like child Proaction would take her in as a foster care system even maybe her parents would let your parents take her in if they are willing to do so.     As i don't have a age it makes it harder to advise as to what could be done for her     she needs to contact the school over it and find out what her options are       Good luck|`|UChvBRU1aa	that is abuse  she needs to call some kind of teen hotline that can help
q2t9nJmsaa	Oh honey I feel for you. I had a ghastly cold at 35 weeks as well and it lasted over 2 weeks, it was a nightmare!    One thing that did give me relief was using a vaporisor at night. It helped me to breathe more deeply and getting that extra rest really helped me recover. Also, sleeping with a few extra pillows to prop myself up helped me breathe as well.     Gargling warm salt water will lubricate your throat and kill off any germs living in there. My Doc reccomended doing this and it did provide immediate relief.    Unfortunately being pregnant means we can't reach for the usual remedies and decogestants that we rely on when having a cold and we just have to tough it out. I really sympathise with you, it's not easy but hang in there, it won't last forever.    Best of luck, keep your fluids up and rest as best you can!|`|1MgpiqfJaa	how long ago did u see the doc if its been 5 or 6 days call ur OB nurse to make sure u dont have bronchitis...tough to kick when your pregnant be sure to tell them you cough until your belly hurts and the congestion|`|3CG3rby0aa	One of the things that i have found to help me when i have been that way is saline nasal spray.  It is safe to use on little babies so I have used it when I have had what you do.  A Humidifier during the day and a vicks Humidifier at night.  Also you can use Popsicles for the sore throat and you can eat as many as you like cause the more fluid you have in your system the sooner you will get over it.  I also tried drinking capri-sun pouches when i am sick.  Everytime I went to the bathroom I would go get two more pouches and drink them.  That seemed to help flush the infection out.  i am sorry to hear about you being sick and I wish you the best of luck to get rid of it.  Get well soon!|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	my medicine list goes as follows:    sore throat:   throat spray (any brand)  cough drops    http://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/taking-m...|`|m1RTNmqsaa	Im 32weeks & Im currently going threw the same thing. My fiance got the mess & has been running a high fever. Thank God so far Ive only gotten the sore throat & cough so far!    My OB said to take Sudafed & Robitussin. I read online that Sudafed wasn't safe so now Ill not take anything & Ill just tough it out.    I hope you get to feeling better & hopefully I do to. Think about it will not be long until your baby's here.      =)
AA11885437	I have the same issues with birth control. They make me dang near psychotic, lol! My mom also has estrogen driven breast cancer, so I really wanted to steer clear of anything with hormones. After a lot of research I decided that I will try the paragard. It lasts up to 10 years but can be removed at any time if we decide we want more children in the future. I was also a little worried about choosing an IUD..but honestly aside from a more permanent solution it looks like the best option out there for hormone free birth control. Other than that, you can always use condoms with a spermacide.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	condoms + breastfeeding.|`|haF1rO2taa	the only thing i knw of that has no hormones is the copper iud.no side effects except some people(me included) get very painful cramps around per time. last up to 10 yrs i believe. i had mine taken out after 1st year. ask doc about it, you may like it, my friend likes it.|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	I'd talk with your doctor, have blood work done to see where your hormone levels are and start taking vitamins/supplements that could help with your mood swings when on your period.  Soy supplements and soy milk helps a lot.  Soy milk does not taste horrible.|`|3g1y1Ahhaa	i dont think that there is a birth control out there with no side effects. but the best one so far for me is the DEPO.|`|5ORyLk4Uaa	i am in the same boat as you. i am on my fourth but i couldnt find any b/c that worked for me so i am just going to tie the tubes. the iud does give lots of trouble. i heard there is a bar that goes into your arm for 5 years. i dont recall the name but it is not the noraplant it is called something else. good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	talk to your doctor about your options because he'll know which hormones didn't work for you. Unfortunetly many women always get side effects with birth control. I had the same problem...Talk to your doctor. He can help you figure out the right hormone to try.

ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I am not a fan of the waiting game... there's just so much anticipation!!     I have tried everything except castor oil (I'm kinda afraid of it) and sex (I don't speak to the father). Nothing seems to help progress. I had a massage last night and it helped me have stronger contractions, but no labor. I'm really hoping he decides to come naturally so I don't have to be medically induced.    Good luck and Congratulations!|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	2 orgasms & a spicy chicken sandwich..had me in labor about 5 hours later.  at 39wks 3days|`|UghJ0XROaa	I tried castor oil once, it didn't work, i tried it a second time, very, very little of it and had my daughter the next morning. Because of how little it was, i don't know if it was that or just her ready to come out.|`|vpL67nETaa	Sex sent me into labor in an atypical way.    As soon as we were done I noticed I was bleeding a fair amount.  So I went to the hospital.    I was already 5-6cm dilated, and they couldn't tell if it was my bloody show or not, so they broke my water and I had my son 3 1/2 hours later.        I was walking everyday trying to get that kid out of me.  In retrospect, if I could do it all over again, I would SLEEP!|`|1EwbKkKCaa	weirdly I got down and hand scrubbed the floors and did squats for like an hour and two hours later my water broke.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	None of that stuff ever worked for me!|`|mXXjoAnfaa	Intercourse, if you can stand it, is the safest, natural, and most proven effective way to "jump start" labor.  The doctor might tell you spicy foods and castor oil, but castor oil makes the pain a whole lot worse, it is like getting Pitocin, ( I might have spelled that wrong).  But sex is the best way, in my opinion.|`|AA10857340	I had sex 3 times and walked up and down the stairs until I couldn't anymore.  I went into labor the next morning.  :)  Plus you can't have sex for 6 weeks at least after you have the baby so having lots of sex is good for you and your husband so you can make it though the next few weeks.  Good luck!|`|tev8K0dGaa	omg with my 2nd baby castor oil worked like magic within a couple of hrs i was in labor and my labor was extremely fast... but i tried it again this time with my 3rd and it did nothing i hate the hell out of a whole pineapple and i ate sooo much it made my mouth raw..but the thing that works soooo goood every time is nipple stimulation. try it. good luck|`|723QHuicaa	Pineapple and sex worked for me... or maybe baby was just ready to come - who knows    It prob had something to do with the membrane sweep i had 12 hours before too.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	My friend drank castor oil. It worked with her first baby, not with her second. Personally, that's not one I was willing to try.    For me, we went for a ride on the Harley, walked around the local Oktoberfest all day, rode home, and went into active labor soon after. (I'd been having irregular contractions since about noon.) Bonus: It was a full moon!
zSo7fvGKaa	im 14  and my "bedtime" is 10  i usually go whenever i feel tired  considering i wake up at 4 for school :/  soo i think 10 is a good time  and if ure not tired then just read in bed till u r!  hope i helpedd! :)|`|FiUprYsvaa	When you get tired.|`|rM2hWRVJaa	I think it totally depends on the 13 year old. I know my son is 10 and he is in bed at 8 pm everyday of the week. And only because if I let him stay up later he would still be up at like 6 am. And then I have to deal with a very irritable 10 year old. Now in general I would say a 13 year old show be allowed to stay up until around 10pm. Now if said 13 year old woke up cranky cause they didnt get enough sleep then I would pull back until about 9. So I hope I helped!!!|`|AA11303916	Well when I was 13 many years ago I had to be in bed at 9 but our kids are in bed by 10|`|UTid4FyCaa	a 13 year old should go to be at 9 on a school night.  If she would like read a bit, then she should be in her bed at 8:30 and read for 1/2 hour.  On the weekends, she should be allowed to stay up until 10. This is how I would do it.  I have a 7 year old and a 3 year old. They go to bed at 8.  Good luck!|`|kuXRD3OVaa	well a 13 yr old should be in bed around 9:30pm. but 10 pm if you wake up good and happy,,but if you dont go to bed at 9:30pm. hope i helped.|`|AA10475412	10:00 PM|`|GIu4DoKlaa	Okay, I gotta tell you... I'm 13, and you have nothing to worry about. I go to bed around eleven or eleven thirty. Now im not encouraging it, but I am able to function with that amount of sleep. We dont all need 20 hours a night. I figure we SHOULD be going to sleep around ten, but, from a fellow 13-er, we all know that isn't going to happen. Amen to that, sister friend!|`|C5Tit9HLaa	10:30|`|ctQLrbvIaa	As long as you get 10 hours of sleep. Really depends on what time you wake up in the morning. 1 get up at 8 so i should be asleep at 10.|`|A1ABvDEvaa	Im 13 an i go to bed at 9:30|`|a8IRxC4raa	Early enough to get at least nine hours sleep.    All the best.|`|Ep0CpwDbaa	I think a 13-year-old should be in bed by 9:00. I only say this because your growth hormones start working at 9:00, so if you're in bed by then it's better for your growth. My daughter is 11, turning 12 next month, and she's in bed by 9:00 and 9:30 on weekends, and gets up at 6:00 in the morning. The rules should stay the same when she turns 13 as well.    But growth aside, 10:00 on school nights and 10:30 on weekends is another idea if you're cranky in the morning.|`|TjtkZEv3aa	It really depends on how tired the 13-year-old is in the morning. The amount of sleep an average 13-year-old needs is 8 to 9 hours, but this can be more depending on the person. If there seems to be a problem, make it closer to 10 hours. So, generally it is 10 o'clock.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I think you should be in your room at 10 the latest at 13 and lights out by 10.30, 11 at weekends

You need a bucket or something similar and a board to use as a ramp. Set the board on the bucket to make a ramp from the floor to the top of the bucket. Trail food up the ramp and into the bucket.

ULHfJVcJaa	ok if you are on birth control then your safe if your not then you have sex and 14 days later you are officially pregnet|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	You could bc sperm live up to 5 days and if you only had sex the sat and not in the 3days after you o'd you are most likely to have a girl. Reason why is girls swim slower but last longer in the environment, where as boys swim fasted but are weaker good luck!|`|DSSZZBTXaa	you may get pregnant it just depends on how long his swimmers last for.      To the people above me...you can get pregnant on birth control ( I did but miscarried ) and XX is a girl and XY is a boy. You people need to go back to school.|`|yT5kxcMtaa	Uh.  ...  A baby?|`|VfvZLTO9aa	Just find an 18 year old girl to get the the plan B.... do not have a baby, it will ruin your life (I know from experience) .... you need to enjoy yourself for a few more years first. Plan B cost 45 dollars.|`|nj8o4Rgzaa	i dont kno what that means but to me it sounds like u ar PREGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sucks|`|nluNSDI4aa	yes you can be because sperm can live up to 3-5days.|`|iyhMF4HKaa	Quit getting pregnant and go to school... that way u will be able to express urself in a way ppl can understand u..|`|KtFZt9Tiaa	Yes, you could become pregnant and what you have a better chance of having has nothing to do with when you get pregnant. It has to do with X or Y chromosome.|`|x42Hz54taa	the easiest time to get pregnant is AFTER your period. not during ovulation  but its possible to get pregnant at any time during your cycle. thats why youre supposed to use protection.  did you have sex with no protection and hope you wouldnt get pregnant? go buy a test if so.|`|jGtJgwXwaa	well you are capable to getting pregnant anytime of the month but you are most fertile 15 days after the last day of your period (they say 15, 16, and the 17th day after. That's not possible to have a greater chance having one sex over the other because the male is what chooses the sex, You have XX chromosomes and a man carries XX and XY. if the male give you a XX its a boy and if he gives you a XY its a girl. good luck with everything|`|0OHfojSpaa	Could be.  Sperm can live for up to 7 days in the vagina and the closer you are to ovulation, the more suited the vagina is to keeping sperm viable.  Good luck to the baby (the gender is 50/50), he/she is going to need it.
jTJNOUMwaa	There is nothing wrong with a baby who know what nighttime is :) enjoy it and definately DO NOT wake her up! the only thing that will accomplish is to switch her days and nights around and make her think she should be waking up in the night to eat.   As long as you think she is getting enough food during the day (which if she wasn't she would be waking up) then be happy she has caught on so early.|`|tdHIR9cLaa	My son sleeps from 9:00p.m. until 9:00a.m.  just consider yourself lucky i know i do! as long as it is not hard to wake her... then you shoudl be fine!!!|`|2arZOZWgaa	You've got a tricky one here! It's hard to contradict the advice of a nurse, so maybe you should consult your daughter's pediatrician or seek another opinion. The nurse is giving you the standard protocol and in almost all cases a baby isn't going to sleep as long as your baby is doing, so there really isn't a question of waking a sleeping baby. I would be very hard pressed to want to wake a sleeping baby, especially if she is getting 5-6 wet diapers a day (like you say she is).     Things to consider would be her day time naps and how long she is sleeping at night total. Also, is she gaining the proper amount of weight? She should definitely be woken to eat if she needs help gaining. Is she eating about every two hours during the day? If you are awake anyway, then it might be wise to wake her up as well and get her to have a feed.|`|4d4bc6d418e7f55703a46a017910893caa	Starting at 7 weeks my daughter started sleeping through the night. She goes to bed around 930pm and sleeps til about 730-8am... so about 11 hours as well. The first night I jumped up and ran to check on her because I was afraid there was something wrong!    I asked our Doctor and she said it was fine as long as she was still having enough pees and poops and gaining weight! Which she is! She eats a bigger formula bottle right before bed (we have to suppliment because I am pumping since she wouldn't latch).    Enjoy it... I have friends who's babies don't sleep more than 3-4 hours a night at the age of 2...|`|XWPAjxsGaa	This happened to my sister. Her baby slept for whole nights throught untill she was about 7 -9 months old (cant really remember) and now she wakes up every 2 hours, so yea enjoy it incase this happens to you..|`|7JFUiBoKaa	The nurse probably doesn't have any kids. My kids slept for 15 hours a night.The only problem is I was breastfeeding and I was in PAIN! My babies were very happy.
4iXL4C6paa	yeah I got a violation for answering this question "Im a man can I have a baby out of my a**", and I answered "idiot, 2 points" and got a violation|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Plenty of times. =) Sometimes the question is too delicious NOT to answer! LOL!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Yes but not in the NB section, it happened in Pregnancy. Some chick asked if having beer would affect her baby. I answered if you have to ask this, you should already know. The next day I saw the violation email and had points taken away for being "insulting". Go figure!    ***Not to mention, I asked a question the other day how far along I looked and someone reported it. I email Y/A appeals and they said it WAS a valid reason for the question being deleted.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	yea , it was a really dumb question...so dumb I forgot what it was..some teen asking about diapers I think and if he could wear them ...or something like that .but I said " Get A Life"        VILOLATION even tho it was a troll.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I've had it happen to me.

What's the worst thing that has happened to your phone: When my dad and I were going to the mall and he got in one of his moods and I was so scared so I was trying to call my mom and before I could get a chance he took my phone and he threw it out of the window! It landed on the concrete too. But....my phone survived surprisingly except for a teeny tiny scratch. This was until he threw it out the window again a different time - now there's a crack in the screen.     ? Do you own a cell phone case/cover: No.     ? Who do you text the most: My friends.     ? Who do you call the most: Meh, my mom when I need to be picked up and two or three of my friends.     ? Do you text in class: No. I don't want to risk getting caught and it taking away. I'll admit I'll do it during lunch but maybe one or two texts.    ? Who pays your bill: So far...my mom, lol. But it's a family plan everyone has the same exact phone in the same exact color.     ? Rate your phone 1-10: Well post - being thrown out the window it was a good 8. Now I'd give it a 5. It's just so slow, the huge crack in the screen is a little distracting. And in some areas I have sucky service. Especially in the school when I'm calling my mom to pick me up. It's okay for now until I have enough money for my own phone.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	?

JEteneuUaa	I like a good hunter.  it soound liek your daughter be a strong hunter,  i live with wolf in farm on mountain top and i like wife with strong name and jaw.  Alexandra sound real good for girl hunter to chew through bear tracks and be up from 3am till 5am trying to get last round up of animals.  If i no get good sufficient foods i can be sure at day break i go home with strong wife in bed and wake up late afternoon with a strong woman.   Alexandra sound like she can get hands bloody and be a strong mate for a good hunting husband congradulations!    you need to be strong like hunter and live every day not regret situation or decision you make,  k thanks-|`|86oPkfzOaa	Actually, I like the name. It's nice, not too popular, but it's not a weird name. There are so many nicknames for it, so you can make it sound cute when she is younger and when she is older, she will have a nice name to use.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Ignore those people. Anybody who says bad things about a baby who has already been named is a heartless idiot. I think Alexandra Renee is a gorgeous name. It sounds very beautiful and classy. You made a great choice. :-)|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Your choice is perfect and I love it. It is classic, feminine and lovely!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I'd tell my co-workers that the child's name has been chosen already, it's not going to be changed. Find something better to argue about.    Your daughter's name is lovely.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.    TX Mom|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	Alexandra Renee is a beautiful name.  It has so many cute nicknames! : Alexa, Alex, Lexie|`|DP48dIxhaa	I like it. You can call her Lexie. Veryy cute.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Please do not be depressed.  I think that Alexandra Renee is a beautiful name and it is sophisticated.  Nothing wrong with being sophisticated. But something is wrong with your co-workers and friends.|`|ZaYyXiJAaa	I think it's beautiful, and it makes me angry how other people can even begin to think they know what's right for you. They don't know you and if they have a problem with the name, then they can go have their own damn children and name them whatever they like. Go you. :)|`|7xGtL1vxaa	who cares what other people say about it. It is a pretty name and you like it, so that is all that matters.|`|GTja6ouWaa	I seriously don't see anything wrong with that name.  Alexandra Renee....  What is there problam?? That is a beautiful femine name, very sweet.   I only know one Alexandra, and how is it dull? A dull name would be something stupid like 'Bob Robert'. (lol) It is sophisticated, but isn't that a good thing?  You can call her Alex, Lexxa, Lexy, Dra, Andra, Andie, Andy, Lex, Ali, Ally, Aly, Aldra, Xdra, Exand, Ndra, Lexal, etc.    I love the name; nice ring to it :)|`|z5tCcEA3aa	awww. its cute. you can call her all sorts of things! ally, al, lexie, andy, its not plain. if those are 2 first names ? thats cute.     btw. nice body for having a baby :O! :)|`|5eKS8Dzcaa	Who cares what other people think!|`|SY9hPeROaa	Do you like that name?  If yes no one else should matter.|`|OcZ0NyqRaa	its a nice name and seriously, **** anyone who has a problem with it. you like it, and its a nice name for a girl.|`|DM3UQmNQaa	I like the name|`|xg4MK2JCaa	Who cares what others think about your child's name!  If you like it, keep it! It's beautiful as it is c:    Also, it's a good name because if you think about the time she grows up to socialize, it sounds good. Lol|`|tyqN6qBUaa	This is funny, because my favorite girl's name ever, ever that my fiance and I are totally sure on using, is Alexandra. Alexandra Christine in fact, though we had a whole list of middle names that went with it. We originally chose it because we both liked the nickname Lexi, then I decided I liked the nickname Sasha (like in Russia) as well. Anyway, point being, why bother listening to them anyway. You named your baby that you gave grew inside you, and gave birth to, not them, with a name that you loved. They can name their kids whatever they want, and you can step back and be happy and assured that they won't be stealing your daughter's name anytime soon.|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	The name is a solid name and she can be taken seriously later in her life. The way some people name their kids cute names they will grow up and never be taken serious. Like the name Honey for this one friend of mine, yeah she's my friend but that is the dumbest name in the world.|`|dM8EyL6caa	That is a beautiful name. Don't worry about what others say. They are probably jealous they didn't name their baby such a lovely name.It's very classy. I can only imagine how beautiful she is with a name like that. People didn't like my daughters name either when I first had her, and I told them I'm the one that carried her for nine months and went through the delivery so it wasn't their decision to make.(her name is Destiny Mae)|`|zBaUWUXfaa	I LOVE that name- its so beautiful. Your friends are messed up in the head. And besides she's 4 years old there's nothing you can do about it now- so I have no clue why there giving you crap about it. I adore your daughters name.|`|9CAXUgOZaa	I don't mind the name Alexandra, but I prefer Alexandria. It's less common and sounds prettier, IMO.  I don't like the name Renee.   Overall though, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the name.    That's my honest opinion since you asked.  But I don't see why anyone would give you a hard time about her name. That's just rude. It's not like it's a horribly embarrassing name or anything.|`|btAVFqZIaa	i like that name alot. It's a very cute name with many nicknames such as Alex, Alexa, Lexi, Lexa etc. It's also not something the kids at school (when shes older) will make fun of.|`|KK7bnIP0aa	Its not Dull! Its beautiful! Cute nickname! I love it!|`|HFhZc7BAaa	I LOVE the name Alex for a girl and have had it on my list for years!!  Be confident in your choice...it was a good one!|`|cCrwi1Toaa	Hello,    I think Alexandra Renee is  the most beasutiful name in the world!! I dont know what those people are talking about. Its sophistacated in a really good way and just plain beautiful its not dull especially because you have all those cute nicknames its classic and feminine but yet very modern, it may be a little popular but its still great its not like its emily,hannah,isabel,or madison. The name is just beautiful!!    This is my advice: dont listen to those haters because its a really pretty name and anybody would be lucky to have it, it was your great name choice not theirs and if it really bothers you just say" Hey, this is my daugther my  name choice and I love it so when you have a baby you name it whatever, just please keep your opinions to yourselves because I love this name and its not as if your opinion will change mine and I think its a perfectly fine name so lets just leave it at that!!!!!" alsojust ignore them if they bring it up because you cant let them get to you so just dont listen to them also you shouldnt care what people think.    I hope this helps I really do love the name so dont feel depressed at all! :)    Love,Sasha :)|`|L1Tu56TFaa	I love the name Alexandra and Renee is very sweet but a grown up name also so that she can also grow into the name.  It really doesn't matter what anyone else thinks because she is your little girl and no one else's, so in other words they don't get a choice.  I would tell every one to butt out as it is not their business, and then... I would ignore them.  Do you like the name?  It is quite obvious you do.  So tell them to stick it.    Goodluck.|`|wZaWDgeMaa	its a beautiful name..|`|wLzuCDmfaa	No I don't like it. I  LOVE it!!!|`|izFtmVCYaa	no its a good name|`|O9aaX9Vraa	Don't worry about what they think I think its a pretty name so why are they worried about it?|`|vw7ebwgnaa	I love it! It's kid friendly (Lexxa or Lexi), teen friendly (Alex) and professional (Alex or Alexandra). It's a very classic name! As long as you like it, who cares!|`|b01a7656f4dfb82f7362e0477bcef88caa	What jerks your co-workers are and anyone else saying negative things about her name.  I think it's a beautiful name, and anyone who says sophistication is a bad thing, obviously has no class.  And being popular means most people like the name, and being dull means it's not some weird trendy name that people will get bored with in a year.  I wouldn't discuss her beautiful name with these morons anymore.      Rude!
uoQiQrnSaa	as much as people say it, it's true..  guys want what they can't have..    just wait for him to come to you..if he doesn't in 2 more days, then go ahead and drop him a line..|`|3g1y1Ahhaa	if i were you i wouldnt waste you time on this guy. if he wants to play hot and cold, then leave him alone. if someone really liked you they wouldnt leave you waiting around like that. thats just mean and stupid. move on, there are bigger and better fish to be caught!!|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Some people don't test there mail all the time. Plus, maybe he has better things to do.    Since you posted this in this section, I assume you're a teenager, and you probably should know that e-mailing constantly is suffocating, and normally scares guys away. It makes them think if you dated, that you'd never let them have space to themselves. I suggest you stop revolving your world around this, and lay off a bit. ??|`|87Dne23saa	hes playing hard to get, jesus.      you act like youve lost contact 4ever!   its only been a little over a day.      hell be back.      promise.|`|a0n9QXUraa	somethings come up...  just give him time.
1e39dc21d986e999b9cf7fb54b59088daa	no its not at all. its ur decision, and nobody is the boss of u. one thing is though that u might want to let them know if u feel uncomfortable.|`|XiOIBwbPaa	no its not bad just take it slow, I haven't seen my father since I was 4 so now he wants back in my life but I wont let him because he's had nothing to do with me all through my life, ..also because he was a drunk and ruined my childhood, but if you really want give him a try theres no harm in it.    and no your not spoilt.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	What does this have to do with being spoiled?    I don't think he can expect you to run to him with open arms and be like nothing happened. Give him a chance - you never know - but your stepdad sounds like he was good to you and that's important.     Take things slowly and see how they go. At least he's making an effort - try not to rake him over the coals because of his past choices and decisions, but he needs to understand your feelings, too.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	I can see not wanting to be his little girl just yet if that ever happens. You have a chance to learn about where you came from like why you have the build you have or other physical characteristics. Maybe someone in his family shares the same interests that you do. I am not saying climb up in his lap and just snuggle like a child. Get to know a little about him. If nothing else maybe you could hang out just once in a while. From a parents perspective he just wants to know things about the child he helped create. Good luck!!!|`|3ctchU2faa	You don't sound spoiled at all. This is a man that you don't see as your father, have never known him. After not having him in your life at all, you can't be expected to go running to him and calling him Daddy.  I would sit down with your mom and step dad and discuss your feels with them and see if they can point you in the right direction.  I hope it works out!|`|2pxiK9waaa	That has nothing to do with bein spoiled. If you have to ask, then you are.     And, no, your dad cannot expect you to be his little girl after 16 years.|`|0IPxeDJiaa	Your feelings seem normal to me.  Give yourself time and tell everyone involved you need some time.  Don't shut your dad out.  Be willing to spend a little time with him, doing something you enjoy: going to a book or music store, then he takes you home.  Going out for ice cream, etc.  But if you're not in the mood, don't do it.  You just need to some time to adjust.  Totally normal.  I think eventually, if you like your dad, you'll come around just fine.|`|l6TzxyN1aa	wut does that have to do with being spoiled??    Give hime a chance, since he didn't knw ou exisited untill recently|`|rid4brOnaa	You're not spoiled at all. Give him a chance to be part of your life. It won't be like most father and daughters, but it sounds like he wants to do right by you. Your love for your stepdad can stay strong. He has been your parent all of this time. You don't have to be his "little girl". Just be his natural daughter and allow your relationship to grow. I'm sure that he realizes that he can't be one of your parents, but his still is - and alway will be - your father.|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	When did he find out about you? makes it easier for us to help you|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Shutting him out completely is not right. However, he should not expect you to act as though nothing ever happened and you are his little girl as if he has been around for 16 years. You need to get to know each other, and he needs to expect that you are not going to warm right up to him. But you should give him a chance to get to know you a little. You don't need to call him dad as your stepfather is your dad as far as you are concerned and it is natural that you would be suspicious of this new person. As far as you being childish, that is silly for many reasons, the operative one being that you are a child! People should not be calling you names in this situation; only you know how you can react here.
dTLTNZTzaa	Yes - relationships could be like that (at least mine is), but you do not have to feel like crap. Most men and women just don't think it is important to have those things in their life.   I was married before (this is my second marriage) to moron that thought that the best way to show his love was to hit me in my face or tell me that I am worthless piece of sh*****. About sharing household chores? Oh no! I was the one who was responsible for it, as well as other things men do. I never looked good, I was ugly (excuse for cheating) and was suppose to wait for him to come home (drunk) with ready food and smile on my face.   It took me 8 years to get over my first marriage and start trusting men. I never though it was possible.  Considering all the above, I never thought it was possible to have relationship you described above. But then I met my second husband and I do have it.   Do not worry - one day you will have it too.|`|K8ZAnuBHaa	NO. its all fake.|`|bcbc474b7a2a4d377949c852d490bea3aa	Sadly, most of the time that's not the case.    But if you manage to get into the right relationship with the right person, everything will feel BETTER than the movies.|`|x9SQVXdOaa	in the best of relationships  when true chemistry seems to fusion  then yes!!  but  its rarely!!    they do EXIST!  but gotta be lucky!!|`|FNaCuPyIaa	it's not crap. my husband and i tell each other i love you more than daily. i do most of the chores around the house, but only becuase i only work part time and the other days i'm home with the baby so i do the chores that need done. i'm not saying we don't have our rough edges but any good relationship takes alot of hard work and commitment. you have to work together and talk to each other and you accomplish want you want. and it's not all no the guys shoulders, we women have to do our part to!|`|VS8mactUaa	In my experience it is pretty similar, we never go a day without I love you everyday more than once, we clean together and laugh at the same time. He does complement me, certainly not as much as the movies, lol :), and we always do something together everyday, Another thing never go to bed angry, me and my bf vowed to never sleep without the other, we lie down and talk about all the things on our minds before we sleep, it can sometimes take hours lol But yeah I think people can be really happy together as long as you and the one you love put effort into the relationship. I wish you all the luck in love.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No, relationships are not like you see in the movies.  When was the last time you saw people actually doing household chores in the movies?    But yes, in a healthy relationship between two emotionally available people, you do say I love you.  You do give compliments.  You do share the chores to be done and spend time with each other.  It's not that hard to tell someone you love that you love them or that they look nice in that shirt.  Or thank them.    You also fight sometimes, and get frustrated, or bored with a long story they're telling too.  But not most of the time, just sometimes.    It's not too much to ask from your life, if that's what you're really asking.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	well, my relationship with my boyfriend is quite amazing ;)    we express our love daily and we get along really well.  he loves to cook, clean and he's a really hard worker.    i love my man :)    you will find your perfect match soon enough.  by the way your picture is so cute!    how old are you? you look very young..|`|dgRTkccBaa	I think most couples do some of that stuff, but in the movies it's all exaggerated.  My husband tells me he loves me, but not all the time like in the movies.  i do most of the household chores but hubby wil pitch in if I'm not feeling well or if there's just way too much to do.  I suppose I get compliments, but just normal ones like if he liked the dinner I cooked or something.  The most time we spend together is to watch a movie on tv or something.  Don't believe everything you see in the movies, it's not real life.  People go to see movies to escape real life.  if the people in the movie were fighting about socks left on the living room floor who would ever go?|`|gTjtaG0Faa	Nope - real people, have to deal with real life problems without the "perfect" script.    1. My husband and I tell each other we love each other at least once a day, sometimes we hid notes for each other just to keep the love alive.    2. NO, however my husband works full time & goes to school full time, so I agree that instead of working a nine to five job with a boss that I would hate I will clean the home and watch the babies. (5 years and my home is still clean!! its amazing!)    3. When I really want a compliment I can hint around for one and he will give me one right away. Most men think we are such great mind readers already that we know how much they think of us with out having to tell us.    4. One on One only when its a very very special date night other than that we spend lots LOTS of "alone" time with our kids and each other.    5. I would not be that hard on the movie industry people don't want to watch movies like Schindler's list over and over again, its a great movie but you don't watch a movie to walk away sad. Watching an movie about a stressed out couple with bills to pay, weird relatives and health problems - some movies can make it funny (while you were sleeping, as good as it gets, you've got mail, ect) but most just want to leave you with a feel good happy feeling.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	My husband tells me he loves me often, and I reciprocate.  Household chores...  Well, since I work in the home much of the household stuff is on me, however parenting is done by both of us.  Compliments?   Yes we share compliments with each other often, it's part of keeping the relationship in good terms and cultivating a long term marriage.  Yes we make time every day to check in with each other and talk about our days, to talk about work and the kids, what needs to happen the next day and what we are worried about.   It's a partnership and you need to check in and talk about things, in the process getting some affection and company.    The truth is that if you do not do those things and you are not working on actively cultivating a good marriage you will fail, it's not just on the husband either.   Marriage is a long term commitment that needs a series of re-connections and re-evaluations, it's not static and the relationship does and should evolve with familiarity and life changes.  It's not a ploy to make you feel like crap, but I do think it's a reflection of relationships that work.|`|kdgNIaoiaa	not everyone's relationship is like that... but yeaaa I know a lot of people in relationships like the ones in the movies :] lol|`|2Z7eXVeWaa	I used to think it was BS until I met the guy I'm with now. I was thinking to myself, wow it really IS like the movies! I mean, it's amazing. It can make you feel like crap until you find it. Maybe it's rare and I got lucky I dunno. I give all the credit to God though.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	They just did a piece about this on the Today show.  It was about how movies give people unrealistic expectations for relationships.  I believe that it was actually a line in "Sleepless in Seattle."  Rosie's character said to Meg's character "You don't want to be in love, you want to be in love in a movie." or something along those lines.  That should answer your question.|`|6LibbJJXaa	Of course they're not. It's crap. Point blank. And who would want it to be true? Living like robots doesn't sound too sweet to me.|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	Most of it is not how it really is (at least for me).|`|50Ty7VRYaa	Depending on the depth of the relationship of the two people some situations can be like the movies.    My boyfriend tells me he loves me whenever he can, and he really means it. (And vice versa).    Household chores can be shared as long as both parties keep up their side of the bargain. It is a team effort!    Men can occasionally give compliments when not asked to do so. My boyfriend has complimented me on my perfume or my outfit when he really likes it and it feels good to hear him say it since it is so spontaneous on his part.    And yes couple really do spend time together enjoying each others company. My mom and her boyfriend of four years always think of fun and creative ways to just hang out together. My boyfriend and I also do the same whether we take a walk downtown together or just lay in bed all day and watch movies together. If it works for us, it can work for other people too!|`|SgaUGKoUaa	It depends on who your dating, not to mention an understanding and open minded guy. They're not non existent though, my boyfriend of three years acts like what you mentioned in your question. He didn't come like that though, we both went through a lot of fighting to get to where we are now, a lot of talking and needing to understand each other. Yes there are relationships like the movies, but what the movies don't show is all the work they require. To have a relationship like that takes time, work, alottt of talking, both people to be understanding, and respectful and much more. When the right guy comes along and you both want to make each other happy, and are committed to doing that for each other, and  a "movie relationship" is what you want, it can happen.
ZcrsqMbcaa	my 14 yr old who is a comedian 24/7 and loves attention from the public...Said really loud while we shopped " MOM dont Look at me like that..thats why Im in THERAPY" Everyone stopped and looked at me..LOL!|`|3ctchU2faa	I was on the phone with my boyfriend and I passed gas and no one was around and I didn't say anything, then he says "Did you just fart?"  I can't believe he heard me!|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	went into the store for un hour  left the window down CZ of the hear came out it was raining and my pants and behind where pretty wet|`|AA10943329	It has been a bit of a boring day for me laugh wise but I was watching Ellen and that made me laugh. Remember a lot of the other questions on here are made up. Hopefully I get a few laughs when I pick the kids up from school in a couple of hours|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Jess Jess my daughter does the same thing! I can't get her to stop!    I had just fed my daughter the other day, and she was stood on my lap. I *thought* I had burped her properly, but obviously not... She burped, and then threw up, and it went straight INTO MY MOUTH!!! It also went all down my cleavage, and I couldn't move, so I was trying to call for my other half, whilst trying not to swallow the sick! My daughter grinned at me the whole time....    Sorry if that was a gross story, but I think it's pretty funny!|`|shBj5RElaa	well my daughter passed gas while at that store, and she nicely says really loud. MOMMY excuse me, I farted on my butt ! we were at the register,lol|`|tIo72iVtaa	the funniest thing that happened 2 me (it wasnt funny at the time) we weree atin dinner and then before i could touch my food my cousin sneezed and his snot was on top of my food. i was so mad because their were no leftovers so i had 2 make a sandwhich. i was mad but now to think of it  its kinda funny lol (can you vote this answer for the best question pleez)|`|kArEdAaTaa	hahaha. Well I am busy folding laundry & my 3 yr old is pretty advanced for her age. So she tells me hey mom im going to put a corndog from the freezer into the microwave. Well here I am trying to fold clothes & soothe my 7 month old son. I forget all about the corn dog & the next thing I know I am coming from the laundry room into the kitchen & there is a thick cloud of smoke; I already knew what it was.     I looked into the microwave & the corndog was jet black; everything smelt like burnt popcorn. You know that icky smell. Well my daughter went to go play outside & obviously she turned it on for 7 minutes when she meant to put 70 seconds.  She isnt real good with her numbers but she tried. Next thing you know she is like mom wheres my corn dog I tell her look in the trash can, she said ewwwww. All I could do was laugh! NO MORE MICROWAVE FOR HER.|`|o9lQrcsYaa	Well, my bf didn't put my Jeep into park so it rolled back into his car and knocked my bumper guard off and left a scratch, but didn't do squat to his little car, then a few minutes later I fell face first into 2 feet of snow...    It wasn't funny at the time, but it's pretty hysterical now...lol|`|NF1sX416aa	Ooh!! :)    Ok so I woke up to the sound of my dog, Shelby, whining. She wanted to get on the bed by my OTHER dog (Rommel) was taking up all the space. Psh, that's just like him. And so Shelby wanted to come up and I sat up to pat the spot next to me but when I did Shelby jumped and laid on my pillow. So I just pet her. But Rommel, being the attention sponge that he is, started whining because I was giving Shelby attention. So I pet both of them at the same time, and then Shelby got up and laid down somewhere else, so then Rommel got up and laid right between me and my brother. (My brother shares me bed, even though he has his own, because, well he's eight and apparently monsters live in his room.) But there wasn't that much space since my brother scoots up right next to you and curls up. So I moved over and Rommel laid down. I pet him a little and laid back down. But he started whining at me because I wasn't petting him. So I petted him until he calmed down. But then Shelby was awake, and ready to go downstairs for the day. So I followed her downstairs. And since my grandparents were staying in the guest room in the basement, we were walking down the hallway and she stopped at the basement stairs. I looked at her, and once she was sure I was watching, she sped downstairs. I followed her, and she was waiting at the door to the guest room. She was barking and I heard my grandma say, "Donald...the dogs out there..." and then I got Shelby to come upstairs, and then she spilled my fruity pebbles and then became a vacumm and ate them all off the floor.|`|KjkDeFbeaa	My daughter who was born November 20th and still in the N.I.C.U. was being held by my 16 year old daughter (also a N.I.C.U. baby) and reached up and held her sisters face for quite some time. This was great for us all since my oldest is quite intimidated by all the wires and the feeding tube and needed some good positive energy today.|`|HqSsNmeUaa	This might not seem funny if you weren't there but here goes!  My one year old son discovered that if he sticks his fingers far enough in his mouth he gags... He thinks this is THE funniest thing in the world, so here he is shoving his hand down his face making a disgusting gagging sound, then laughing hysterically!  I tried so hard to take his hand out and say NO without laughing myself but it was just so odd and funny to me at the time I couldn't say it without laughing!  So that egged him on even more.  Finally I got control of my laughter and was able to pull off a serious face and a real stern no.  Crazy kids!|`|Ke9gAvJTaa	We were in Walmart and we were in the isle, and My son Dropped a thing of milk, ( He wanted to be a big boy and hold it for mommy) And it dropped and it spilled every where, Then he sat in it and started playing in it and said " Yayy! I clean it"|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	those weren't even realistic questions.  seriously just bizarre made up stuff.  read Jen's question lots of happy thoughts there.  funny today?  hmmm i've got nothing but my story of the week is that i chased a mouse out of my house w/a broom.  i had to fight with it for like 10 mins though.  it was a tough guy.  i have a cat but shes worthless.  my daughter thought it was hilarious to see mommy shrieking like a little girl every time the creepy creature came near me.    EDIT - i understand.  believe me i do too.  i think that person was just being a butt.  no good comes out of those types of questions so why even go there, you  know?  well hopefully my mouse story helped to distract a bit.  :-)
UUpsa35Daa	I can see why your mother would be nervous about it. It's what parents do when it comes to their kids...minor or adult, they worry.    But i honestly don't see that big a problem with it. As long as you're mature and responsible enough to handle it and don't make any "out there" decisions like having alcohol or anything you should be good to go.    Get together with you brother and set up a plan of what will happen that day, when you'll leave the house...when you'll get to the city...when you'll be back. Add on if you plan on going else where for food or something like that. Then take it to your mother and explain it all. Reassure her that you'll both be careful, there will be no drinking etc. And call or text her every 1 or 2 hours to let her know things are going smoothly.     I wouldn't miss a jazz concert for the life of me, like the music too much. So i would do basically anything (abiding by parents rules) to be able to go. It sounds like that's what you have to do.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	my god why wont she let you take him ..thats ridiculous|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	If  you trust them I would let him, but if you have any doubt then just say no........|`|a42JpX2uaa	Parents can be over protective, even when the kids are adults.  I think it would be fine, unless I question the maturity or responsibility of the sons.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I'd be nervous about it myself. Maybe you should tell her you will check in every hour if she lets you both go. (text every hour or something) and of course promise that there will be no drinking at all. Not even 1 during the concert.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Your mom is being ridiculous.   Just take your brother and go have fun.|`|l6TzxyN1aa	it would depend on the maturity level of the 23 year old. If I felt he was responsible I would be fine..it sure would be a HUGE waste of money to have the tickets and not go
o9u4H6m6aa	I teach natural birth classes.  There are really so many ways to reduce pain in labor, I can't cover them all in one letter. Plus, what works for some women may not work for others. Every woman has a different background of experiences, and every labor experience is different. It would be helpful for you to talk with someone experienced about all your preferences, current coping strategies, fears, knowledge base etc.    Having a doula (professional labor support) to discuss things with before labor and to be with you in labor is very helpful. Several studies have shown that doulas reduce the need for epidurals, cesareans, and other interventions.    Another important factor is the doctor or midwife that you choose. Find out how they practice. If you have a doctor who practices with a high rate of interventions - cesareans, epidurals, inductions, etc, you may as well give up your hope for a natural birth.  Medical interventions are necessary and helpful in certain situations, but many practitioners overuse them.   If you choose a caregiver or a hospital that routinely restricts women to lying in bed, using continuous fetal monitoring, or inductions for no medical reason other than being past 40 weeks, then labor is going to be extremely painful. Lying back is the most painful position in labor, and induced labors are way more painful than natural labors.    Also, fear and the adrenalin that it produces increases the sensation of pain greatly. Feeling safe, cared for and supported helps women relax. Having caregivers they trust, and trusting that their bodies know how to give birth. Going within themselves and listening to their bodies is really helful for natural birth. When women in labor feel safe, they produce endorphin hormones. If you've ever run a marathon or something, you'll know that initially your muscles will hurt, but after a while the endorphins kick in and you start to feel euphoric. You don't notice the pain so much, you just feel great.  In labor that can happen too, and the baby gets all the moms hormones, so it feels it too.     Have you noticed how some women say the pain of labor was the worst experience of their lives, while some women say labor was the best experience of their lives.   This difference is due to the different hormones.   Fear, anxiety = adrenalin = slowing down labor and severe pain.  Safety, trust, support, love = oxytocin and endorphins = less pain and feeling great.    Once you've got the basics, you can try out some things women have found useful for dealing with the intensity of labor - moving, changing positions, upright positions, resting in side lying positions or kneeling forward over a chair or exercise ball or their partner, hot packs, ice packs, showers, warm baths, massage, counter pressure on the back and hips, moaning, swaying, making deep sounds, kissing, breathing, visualization, swearing :> , squeezing their partners hand till it turns blue :> ...    Attitude is important too -  The tendency is that when a contraction is starting, to tense up and  resist and think, "oh no, another one. ****!"  But tensing up makes the sensation of pain greater.   It's useful to think, "oh good, another one. That's one more contraction closer to having my baby in my arms. My body is doing great work." Then after the contraction take a deep breath and release all the tension in your body.    As for your period cramps, I don't think that means a more painful labor. I think it means you've developed a bunch of coping strategies that can help you in labor.    I really hope that helps, and I'd appreciate any feedback you can give me on what information you found useful or not useful.  childbirthcentral@gmail.com  Thanks.|`|ROJans2Taa	with my first I didn't have an epidural, I was allowed to use the whirlpool tub until I was ready to push, it definitely helped, it takes the pressure off some, also if your hospital permits, the exercise ball was great, with my second I was going natural for awhile until I got stuck at 5 cm, I used the ball until that point and it really helped, sitting and rocking back on forth on it took my mind off the pain. as for the labor and how bad it will be, it depends on alot of factors, theres no guarantees, I had back labor with both my kids and it was extremely painful, however my periods arnt that bad, best luck
gx4s68s8aa	They just check everything very closely and the tech is highly trained.  This is the basic difference between a regular ultrasound and a level two ultrasound from what I understand.  Your doctor might have the capability to see your baby in 3D so they may do some of those pictures just for fun.  But I think your scan will be mainly in 2D.  There are very exact measurements that they can take of the neck, head etc, that can help them check for problems.  I have to have level 2 ultrasounds at my high risk doctor every few weeks because I have a clotting disorder.  And my baby has to be checked for blood clots in the placenta.  Because my doctor has a machine that does 3D and 4D pictures as well as the 2D, they do a little 3D at the very end of every appointment.  Not sure if your doctor will but they might.|`|JgpyfuuWaa	Your baby will be measured from crown to rump, around her middle, around her head. The four chambers of the heart will be viewed, as well as the kidneys, bladder, stomach, brain, spine, and sex organs (be sure to tell your sonographer if you don't want to know what he or she sees  or doesn't see).     Measurements are taken to make sure your baby is growing appropriately (and that his or her gestational age is still on target). A survey of the organs, including the umbilical cord, ensures that they are developing normally (or identifies any potential problems as soon as possible). The sonographer will also be looking at your amniotic fluid levels, the location of the placenta, and the fetal heart rate. Settle in to enjoy the show: The detailed level 2 scan can take 30 to 45 minutes.    If the triple screen, quad screen or AFP demonstrates a higher risk of Down syndrome, this should be noted on the ultrasound request. Then markers should be noted by the ultrasonographer or radiologist. Such indications of Down syndrome would be foreshortened thigh and upper arm bones, echogenic bowel, nuchal (or neck) thickening, kidney abnormalities, choroid plexus cysts and structural fetal abnormalities, such as a heart defect.|`|CXKQOBqCaa	I had one when my first ultrasound showed a bright spot on the left ventricle of my baby's heart. A level 2 is just another ultrasound but focuses on the specific area of concern. No need to worry. I was scared at first but all was well, there was no spot, our baby is fine and we just got a few extra pictures of him. Good luck! I hope this answered your question.|`|VJpdmd0waa	I had the same thing done 3 weeks ago because my cam back abnormal. With the Level 2 ultra sound its makes everything a lot bigger.  They check his face, spine, an the flab on his neck, look at the blood vessels in the heart, an measure how much he weigh, an how big his head is an what not. Everything turned out to be fine with my baby. But they say they can look fine an still have down syndrome.  Good Luck..  Need anymore help shoot me a email.|`|ejHfqSD1aa	Nothing really happens. They just put gel on your belly and then use this probe looking thing and look at your baby. I'm not sure about the last part of your question, how they would see, but just trust your doctor. They know what they are doing. I hope everything goes good for you and your little one.|`|15UZwW2laa	I'm not exactly sure but I have to have one done on Feb. 19th.  At my 20 week ultrasound everything was perfectly normal with my son but he showed a "bright spot" on his heart.  So I was referred to have another ultrasound done as well.  The just look much closer at the baby.  Also to find the fold in the baby's neck, the measure the amount of fluid behind the neck.  Do you do the testing that told what your chances were of having a down syndrome baby.  Mine was 1 in 10,000.|`|5ORyLk4Uaa	i went to this with my first. the screen can come back wrong due to inacurate dates of pregnancy. i was a month off of my due date. i hope this is the same for you. what they do is look at your babies spine and other organs. the tech will measure your baby's organs. she will highlight the blood line to see where it flows. relax and good luck these test have to be done around 15 weeks of pregnancy if it is done early or after around 18 weeks then they might come back wrong.|`|HgKt3zJ5aa	it's just a better look, alot of times the doctor (radiologist) will come and scan after the tech. as for the 3d- you can see everything on 2d that you see on 3d it is just alot of 2d pics put together.

pR4nLjyRaa	If you had sex 4 days before your period most likely you are not pregnant. You're probably just stressing too much and causing your period to be late. But you can tell if your pregnant 2 weeks after sex so if you test now it should be accurate. Good luck!|`|ygimTNzoaa	My symptoms were loss of appetite pretty much was it in the first month. Everyones different. I say you can tell usually in 3 weeks. I went to the store and bought the more expensive pregnancy test that reads "pregnant" or "not pregnant". Simple enough, and it gives you 2. So you can try 1 the 3ed week, if no then again in another week or so. Mine in the 3ed week was positive, so I know it's at least 3 weeks. Probably just depends on the quality of the product you're testing with too. I'm about 20 weeks (5 months) pregnant now.|`|AA11471252	I could almost always tell right away. I mean the same day!    And that yellow stuff is called bile, it builds up in your stomach sometimes during your whole pregnancy-yuck. The best way to get rid of it is to drink a few ounces of chocolate milk first thing in the morning. You will puke right away, but at least it won't be sour stuff, because the chocolate is sweet.|`|kkxn0Q4Aaa	take a pregnancy test - get it from a chemist duh!  but anyways good luck,   sounds liek ur preggers|`|4XfjUcvDaa	you can test up to one week before your period is due.  go to the store and get a test to be sure.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Most pregnancy tests will pick up the pregnancy hormone the day of your missed period.  For me, I didn't get a positive test until my period was 5 days late.  I didn't have morning sickness until I was 8 weeks pregnant, but everyone is different.  My advice to you is to retest since your period is two weeks late, and to use protection EVERY time no matter how long the intercourse is!
7uy8iy7laa	hmm....that's a hard one  Charlotte Stephanie  Julia Stephanie  Leah Stephanie   Mckayla Stephanie  Abigail Stephanie|`|VGij9p0Taa	Olivia is really classy name meaning olive tree (i adore olive trees) it works really well with Stephanie.

Take some of my other advice on the other question you asked it may help, however Olivia is great.   hope this helps...|`|uS07WAwcaa	Olivia is a very pretty name but I dont think that it goes with Stephanie  Some other choices are:  Stephanie is harder to pair as a middle name and easier to pair as a first name for example:  Stephanie Rhys (pronounced Reese)  Stephanie Mickayla  Stephanie Paloma|`|EkXQVZU5aa	Bubba, it just flows so well|`|XnNT4l0Xaa	Elisabeth Stephanie  Morgan Stephanie    Olivia Stephanie doesn't sound too great.|`|xrJqmRFqaa	I'm not crazy about Olivia Stephanie.

Olivia is becoming a pretty popular name but if you don't mind that then it sounds great. I think shorter names ending in 'a' sound good with Stephanie after. Other names I like are:  Isla Stephanie  Leah Stephanie  Mia/Maya Stephanie  Gia Stephanie|`|AA11273571	I agree with MinLo.  A shorter first name.  How about Iona?|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like olivia Stephanie.
pqZAhBLvaa	Depo will wreak havoc on your body. I was on it for a year, and never stopped bleeding the whole time. It made me nuts. It was like really bad PMS all the time. It gave me a lot of the symptoms you have described, like acne, soreness, unable to sleep, weird discharge. It's crazy. Do yourself a favour, and pick another birth control. If it is this bad for you already, just wait. It really messes with your system. Try Nuva Ring. You just do it once a month, you can't feel it, and it is just like the pill.|`|AA11129760	My guess would be that it is all side effects from the shot. I would wait another week and retest, or go to a dr for a blood test.

1S5AbPueaa	My oldest was born Aug 8 2005.My youngest July 22 2007.So we have got almost 2 years.I was shooting for 22 years ,but I didn't quite make it.  Pros:I can save clothes and they both got to wear them..I didn't have to buy anything for 2nd baby besides diapers and car seat.I already had all major items from 1st baby.Me and my sis are almost 2 years apart and have a good relationship.I wanted that for my boys. You are still in baby mode the younger your 1st child is.Child always has a buddy at home.Oldest gets to help out..I know there isn't much age difference but he can tell you when babies crying bring the diapers wipes binky etc..  Cons:Fighting all the time:) Everything is 1 persons they cannot share its mine mine mine..I had a hard time going grocery shopping with 2 babies. 2x the stress.  All in all I wanted my babies to be close in age.I am 22 and I have sis who is 21 20 brothers 16 15 14 sis 12 bro 3.Whoa I know!! But I have the closest relationship with my sisters because we went thru the same stuff closer together.Ps the bro n sis are 1/2 , and step and in 2 different families. As I write this we are having a fight over the lego blocks...UUGGHHH oldest is saying mine and youngest is saying mmmaaaa|`|LNnRSLdtaa	they are 20 17 12 and 7|`|EcdelIHtaa	it will be hard i have 2 daughters one will be1yr old this month and the other one 4 in march so they are 3 yrs apart and that was hard!! but i think its better to have them growing close in ages   but its different with other women... so do whatever u feel is right =]|`|26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	I have four kids.  Oldest is 20, then 10, then 9, then 6.  The 10 and 9 year old are so close and it is great having them close.  I wish I would have had all four like stair steps.|`|N6vEZVNEaa	5 MONTHS BETWEEN MY 2 KIDS (DUE 9.23.09)|`|54q0mJvQaa	There is 2 years between my sister and I,  4 Years between myself, and my brother.  And 10 years, between my two brothers.    My half sister and half brother are 1 year apart.    My fiance and his sister are 3 years apart.    And I want to have my kids 2-3 years apart.|`|mxixfE3Raa	If you think that you would be ready and be able to cope with another baby, then go ahead. But just remember you'll need the help of your husband alot more with the second because as you know your child needs alot of attention, and this may be hard to give with a tiredness in pregnancy etc.  But yeah If you want then you should start trying.  I aim for about 2 years in between mine.  My son is nearly 2 and i'm 25 weeks with triplets, i'll have four children at 19 years old!  After the triplets me and my husband do want more, but we're thinking of waiting atleast 4 years because 4 young children is going to be so much hard work!    Good Luck|`|OY98G3HOaa	I have three children   a boy 5  a girl 4  a boy 2    My oldest 2 are 15 months apart. My youngest 2 are 2 years apart. I love having them this close together. They are usually hitting the same stages together or right after one another so I know what to expect. They get along well, but still have their disagreements. It is a lot of work though, so you must be prepared, I have constantly been dealing with diapers for 5 years now. At one point in time I had 2 in diapers, that was really hard. and expensive!! I havent had a full nights sleep in 5 years either. I am constantly being pulled into 3 different directions. Mind you I am not complaining I love my life now, but I thought it best to be honest. (and just in case you want to have a third I will tell you 3 is waaaay harder than 2)    Good luck to you!!|`|jSMiLEDJaa	I have 3 children and my children are 11, 7 and 4. I know alot of people plan their children alot closer I think this was a terrific span. When I was pregnant I did not have to worry so much about restrictions on picking up or carrying my older children. I never had more than one child in diapers or nursing. My children are close enough they are still able to play together and learn from one another.I personally having the kids all at the same stage at the same time as being a disadvantage for our family.|`|T3nxSbZwaa	I have 3 children, ages 7, 6, and 18 months... I love the age differences between mine.  When I found out that we were going to have our first, my husband and I were backpacking across Canada... so we came back home and settled down, then a year later we were married, and a month (almost to the day) we found out we were expecting our second.  Our 3rd was a surprise... he picked us to be sure.  :o)    I really think that when the situation is right (if you tend to agree or not) the baby will pick you... you just have to be open to the possibility.     Good luck!|`|Hi5h9739aa	My kids are 2 years apart.  I don't think that there is really a set time of when to have more.  If you are ready and you think you can handle a 1.5 year old and  a newborn go for it!  I like my kids close in age.  They always have someone to play with them.  They are interested in the same things which makes family time easier. (I mean like games, arts and crafts,  and disney movies, etc.)  Good luck|`|JkTGq2BJaa	My wife and i had our 2 children 15 months apart we are not unhappy with the decision. There was the usual sibling rivalry but nothing crazy. we were both in our 40's and they were all grown up and on their own, we are still young enough o enjoy our grand kids and do things we want to i wouldn't change a thing if i had to do it over again. I look at it this way, if they were twins or triplets they would be the same age so there is no right age as long as you have the income to take care of them.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	People say to wait 2-3 years because that way your son will be more independent and you will not have as much of the jealousy issues that you will have if your son it still so Young. He will feel like the baby is taking his place instead of being able to understand that he is gaining a brother and that you love him the same. Right now he still needs mommy allot and when he gets to be 3 he wont need mommy as much. That meaning he can be about 3 when the baby is born you don't have to wait until he is 3 to start trying to get preggy you can probably do that when hes about 2. Not saying that this is always the way it happens some children are fine when they have another sibling early. It all depends on your son. Do you know someone that has a baby that you could watch for the a day or two and see how you son reacts to not having mommy to himself any more? Because a new baby needs allot of attention and it will take a great lot of attention away from him. You just have to figure out what is right for your family and your son! Good luck!|`|nzY94B7waa	I have 2 kids and one on the way.    Daughter 7 (she'll almost be 8 when the new one comes)  Son 3 (he'll be 4 in may)  I'm 3 months pregnant (due in Aug)    I like the space in between.  My mom had 5 kids in 6 years and she loved it.  We were born in 1980, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986.  So do whatever feels good for you and your family.|`|kAdgwDFqaa	If you were to get pregnant now it would be hard because yours in so young.  He would be a handful when he becomes independant and getting around.  I think 3 years is good.  My son and newborn are 3 1/2 years. He helps me out a lot at his age. But I know what ya mean.  I want another one now too.  Crazy huh!  Mine is only 13 weeks old.  Good luck!|`|cbIxKGZVaa	As long as you don't turn into the California lady with 16 kids and no Daddy I'd say three years apart is fine    I have three children and they are all three years apart and yes they still fight with each other    I was seven years apart from my brother and that was hell growing up|`|EtCRnDJMaa	we started trying for baby   2 when my 1st daughter was 12 months old.  Our 3 girls are 8 1/2,  6 1/2, & 4.      First of all- Don't listen to what anyone tells you, do what you want.  It's your family! If I were to listen to people I wouldn't have baby   3.  If your ready, then go for it!      I can't think of any cons when it comes to having children, either way you do it.  I'm happy with how mine are spaced.  I think you'll get different answers with everybody.  I liked having mine close so that when baby   2 came my first was young and she doesn't remember life without her.  She isn't jealous.  They're best friends!|`|6542d65c904582403b7e46c7c170a38eaa	I have two sons 2 years and 2 months apart.  It worked out nicely when they were very little because babies and toddlers require a whole lot of time and attention so my older son understood that a little.  I have a friend who has a 13 year old, 5 year old and 18 month old.  She wishes she would have had hers all more evenly spaced but not as close as the second two.  I would say that about 2 years apart works nicely for the family dynamic.  It takes time to get used the routine of a baby and to have your family adjust to the new baby so don't rush into baby number 2.  Give yourself and your body and your family time to recover from number 1 and you will be thankful in the long run.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Just short of 4 year between my youngest and middle-which is a lovely gap. Just enough that my eldest could understand a new baby coming along, close enough so they could play together (and still do) but not so close that I had 2 babies, 2 sets of nappies, 2 lots of teething, et going on.    Almost 7 years between my middle and youngest which was too long for me as I felt a bit lost when we had a new baby-everything felt so strange!    Hoping for one more so thinking of starting to try in the next few months as our youngest is now 2. Figured by the time I fall pregnant and have the baby, our youngest will be gone 3.    Just think of how much time your little one takes up now-you will have to make double the time as an 18 month old baby takes up a lot of time. You will be running around with a toddler and have a newborn baby at the same time. My best friend has 4 children, all under 7... And I don't thik she has had a full nights sleep since the first one was born! If you think you can handle it, go for it!!|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I've always wanted 3 children, 3 years apart.    My oldest is 4 and my youngest is 14 months. I plan to TTC in mid-2010 so the next baby will be born when my youngest is 3.5 years old.     I'm trying to plan the next baby so it's birthday isn't close to my other two's. My youngest was born Nov. 26th & my oldest was born Dec. 17th....and then there is Christmas (all in 4 weeks). It's expensive now,  I don't want to add another birthday in that time-frame.|`|AA10811784	My second will be born just two months shy of my first daughter's fourth birthday.|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	12 years between my kids:  yet more proof that God has a sense of humor.|`|thoMmZAvaa	I have four. Eighteen months between my first child and a set of twins. Two years between the twins and my newborn (couple weeks now). I think considering timing is more than how old the baby is when your due, but also should consider other factors such as when they start school (or pre-school), potty training, etc. Training a two year old with a baby crawling around is much harder than either having them trained before the baby comes or before the baby starts moving around. I'm fine with having mine so close together (last one was a surprise, not planned), but it was definitely a challegene (beyond the twin thing). However, I love how close they are with one another (thus far) and how easy it's become for them to play together.|`|S3vYMNzFaa	I'm glad you mentioned you're husband was wondering too!        Congratulations on your son, first of all!  I'm not a mom, but I'm one of five kids.  My mom and dad had me (Their wedding was Nov19, I was born Aug19!).  And then two and a half years later my sister came.  Two years after that, my brother, but then only a year for my sister, and then three and a half years for the baby.      It's fine to have your babies close together.  But, if you're only going to have two babies in your family, maybe wait a little while so you can enjoy the baby stages on their own.  When siblings are 9 months apart, it's called Irish twins!    People used to think my brother and sister were twins - they were a year and a half apart.      There isn't a right or wrong answer.  Hopefully some of this information will help you decide, but getting pregnant now is not a bad or crazy thing.  It's perfectly fine.  I recommend doing it if you want to!|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	mine are 4 years apart and it's nice not having 2 babies at the same time crying and having 2 sets of diapers but also it was like starting all over again cause once my daughter was potty trained I had my son so I would suggest going for it if it's what you want|`|7LtbetTFaa	About 2 years IMHO. Not too close but still close enough for them to have enough in common to bond well. It also doesn't leave so much time that the first has grown so accustomed to being an only child that it becomes a problem. I also found that you  are catching them at a time where they want to help and allowing them to help with the care of their younger sibling/s also helps bonding.|`|Ty6vGEj9aa	If you feel you are ready and could take care of two children already, then go for it! And as you said, there would still be a year and a half between the kids.
G2auAv1Saa	Shower the night before, set out clothes the night before (you and baby), wake up earlier, have baby bag packed the night before, hit the ground running- don't sit and drink coffee or read the paper, skip fancy hair-dos, learn to do your make up in 2 minutes, multitask, put baby clothes on, put your clothes on, grab your shoes and out the door.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Shower and get ready while baby is asleep works for me. At least shower while she is asleep... and budget extra time into your morning routine if baby doesn't agree with sleeping while you shower!|`|UghJ0XROaa	I work second shift, i wake up around eight,   get my 2 year old breakfast   nurse my 3 month old  do dishes, fold laundry, run sweeper, clean bathroom, etc  then nurse baby again  give 2 year old lunch  bathe both kids  nurse baby  out the door by 12:45    it helps that their aunt watches them until daddy picks them up at 3:15, we just load her up with all the supplies so there is no diaper bag to pack    It's not easy!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i went back to work when my  son was 6 weeks- i would wake up at 5 am, pump, get myself ready then wake him up get ready drop him off at my parents and then go to work. i got myself into a routine. usually got myself ready before i woke him up. it was hard when he woke up early though  i usually showered at night|`|nAOlBmzDaa	I'm a stay at home mom, so when I read how all these girls are able to juggle work and baby, I feel really lazy! lol|`|AykczQleaa	I get up at 4am and I have to leave the house about 5:50 to make it to the bb sitter by 610 then to work by 645 its a lot of work, but its the only way I know how to keep the heat on in the house and buy diapers and cute clothes.  Then I get off of work at 4pm and am there by 430 to pick him up then home by 5.  We are usually in bed by 8:30 or 9 at the latest....then all over again the next day.|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	I wake up really early before my 4 month old daughter wakes up.

Good luck|`|iOSEVRPPaa	I start back to work in 2 weeks, but I haven't been late for any appointment yet.      What I do is, even if it is hours before I need to go, but the baby goes to sleep, I get ready then.  I use any free time to get myself ready - even if it is way before I need to leave the house.      I get my baby ready right before leaving.    When I start back to work, I plan on putting him in his bouncy in the morning after I feed him.  I've been practicing and he lets me make myself breakfast and take a shower with no problems.      Good luck!|`|AA10857340	Yeah I don't know!  My husband was laid off right after my baby was born.  So he stays home with her.

When he goes back to work full time next month I'm going to have to figure this one out!|`|8tagIO3aaa	let the baby sleep while you get up a little earlier and shower make coffee have some time for you then when you are ready get baby  ready and then you are set no problems   get to bed early set things out for the both of you the night before  that should help.preset the coffee maker or set t up so all ya gotta do it turn it on  but if you don't drink coffee even better head right for the shower or bath relax take  it easy just need an routine it gets easier   GOOD LUCK!|`|WirFwirLaa	I have a 1 year old that I take to the babysitter every morning before going to work. And I have to be at work @ 7:30! I save time by loading up my sons bag for the sitter the night before & throwing it in the car. Plus it helps that he goes to the sitter in his PJ's. I also shower and lay out my clothes the night before. So only thing I really have to do is get myself dressed & ready, get my little boy out of crib,change his diaper, put on his coat, pop his pacifier in his mouth & out the door we go. It's pretty much routine for us now.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	I must be at work around 7:45am and have about a 45min drive.  My husband must leave home at 6:30 am.

Yesterday she slept until we were ready to go, but this morning hubby had to step in.  I leave around 6:30-6:45am, drop her at daycare (Mimi's house) and take off to work.  As soon as I lay her down at night, I lay out my clothes, pack her bag for the next day, lay out her clothes, and make sure everything is ready for morning.  So far everything is going fine, and I'm sure after a few weeks, she'll fall into a schedule with me.  It's hard leaving her, even if it is with Mimi, but I must work.  I just wait for 5pm to get here so I can rush home to her.      Good luck to you....|`|0QYIbn1saa	I totally understand.  In 16 months, I've finally gotten pretty good at it.  I always take a shower the night before and have all of my clothes laid out the night before (yes, like a 7th grader, ha ha ha).  I also pick out my sons clothes the night before.  I spend 5 minutes on makeup in the morning and then we sit down together for 1/2 hour to have our breakfast.  The shower thing has really helped to manage my time.  Hang in there, it will get easier with time!|`|CdodhnP5aa	I don't have to be at work till 9:30 and I'm awake at 6:30...that's how its done and I have a 3 yr old in School and a 1 month old.|`|ZZNleIrhaa	I used to shower the night before and get up really early to get ready.  It gets easier the older they get I think. Good Luck|`|r9ajzkldaa	Prepare during the evening or weekend. I prefer during the weekend. Pick out your clothes for the whole week, so you don't have to think about it in the morning. Make a plan of what food you gonna make during the week. Take a shower the night before. The less you have to decide in the morning the better. And may be you may need to wake up just 5-10 mins earlier to make a difference!!     Good luck!!!|`|LeNeinDUaa	i get up at 530 and go to the gym, shower there and go to work. my husband gets up at 6 and gets him and the baby ready drops her off at daycare. I pick the baby up after work. I have all my work stuff, lunch, gym bag packed the night before.    a few suggestions:  Get up before the baby gets up if she is on any kind of schedule...if she usually gets up at 6 then you get up and shower/dress at 530 etc.     You shower at night, pack your bags for work and lay out clothes. that way you can focus on the baby in the morning. prepare as much as you can the night before.    when baby wakes up, change, dress and feed right away, put her in her bouncy seat (or whatever makes her happiest) while you shower and get ready.     Always give yourself 2 hours from when you get up to when you have to leave.

4iXL4C6paa	I had two natural and I didn't cry I tried to put all my concentration on breathing...but it was hard, I have never felt pain like that before.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i dont know cause i had an epi, but i did make it to 9 cm dilated wihtout any pain relief and being induced with pitocin (much worse than natural) and I was crying. so i dont know, i dont think most women could do without shedding a single tear.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	it should be . im not very strong in that way.

The ultrasound techs aren't supposed to say anything to you about what they see because the Radiologist reads it all more in depth and gives the results to your OB.   You Doc will for sure let you know what's going and and should have the results by now so if you are really worried you should call the office and ask what's going.|`|UeffSgRuaa	Just keep going back to your doctor and have them keep checking and they will tell you for sure. Most likly it is nothing. My doctor always thought something was wrong and ran test and then he said nothing was wrong it better to get more ultra sound and test to know for sure. Now i have a perfectly healthy 5 month old Boy named Jaiden
gJrHBtp1aa	baby oil is no longer recommend except for cradle cap. The oil is just that, oil. It sits on the skin and blocks pores.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Baby oil is not that good for babies, some babies get rashes from it.|`|sMukgX7Xaa	Yes, just be easy and don't get it in the mouth or eyes. Watch putting oil in the hair alot. It makes it really greasy. Just wash it out if you do.|`|ltst5ELYaa	no, my hospital told me it had alcohol in it so it will make it worse. read the ingredients on the back.  they said infants have enugh moisture themselves, (unless medical) to moisturise their own skin so nothing is okay|`|24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	My doctor told me no lotion for two months.  The babies skin absorbs EVERYTHING right now, so it isbest to wait a few months.      I really want to put lotion on my baby because his skin is peeling, bit they told me not to so I don't.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	yes gently and if they fuss then stop...You dont really need to use the oil just gentle rubbing on the feet and legs is good and cuddles|`|V6slDthdaa	Sure, if you want to...but why? Baby lotion is a lot less messy.|`|59SM8kFIaa	yes all the time and if you do the bicycle, movements with their legs it helps them go poo!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Of course. But it would probably be best to wait until right before you put baby down to sleep for the night, because he/she will be slippery and sticky.|`|tSMRYe8waa	Yes it may even help with putting her to sleep|`|MQ34YW28aa	yes if you want to. I think it gets too messy though. I've been using Aveeno baby lotion on my son and it works really good plus he isn't all greasy.|`|LTK3It62aa	There are infant massage books out there that don't recommend baby oil.  Other oils are more natural.  I can't remember the massage book, but it was referenced in the book The Happiest Baby on the Block.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	I wouldn't, baby oil is nothing but petroleum by-products with added fragrance.     This is just one of the articles I've read.   http://www.diannesskincare.com/petroleum...  Petroleum by-products - Baby Skin Care Caution  Posted on August 24th, 2008 by Dianne Gilbertson     words of caution on petroleum by-products  Mineral oil, a byproduct of the distillation of gasoline from crude oil (or, basically a refined motor oil), is the main ingredient in many baby care items. Baby Oil, Vaseline? (petroleum jelly) and baby lotions all contain mineral oil as a key ingredient.    The problems  1. The skin is the bodys largest organ and plays a vital role in overall health. Mineral oil acts as a thin plastic, impenetrable layer on the skin. It is difficult to absorb and clogs the pores, which slows the skins ability to eliminate toxins  which can promote acne and other disorders. This process slows down skin function and normal cell development causing the skin to prematurely age.     John Hopkins University claims that mineral oil in moisturizers is the number two leading cause of aging ( 1 cause is the sun). According to Australias National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC), Prolonged contact with mineral oil has the associated risk of developing skin conditions such as oil folliculitis, eczematous dermatitis, melanosis of the face and plantar warts.    A recent article in Positive Health Magazine, outlines the dangers of the mineral oils found so ubiquitously in the majority of cosmetic products, including baby oil, lipstick, face creams, body lotions and sunscreens. Mineral oil (classed as a petrochemical pollutant and xenohormone) can have negative effects on hormones and the skins ability to breathe, attract moisture and detoxify. It can also slow down cell renewal and be the second (after the sun) most likely cause of premature ageing. In fact sunscreens produced from mineral oil may promote skin cancer as well as colon and breast cancer.    Some mineral oils are carcinogenic. Studies have shown that poorly refined mineral oil can induce skin and scrotal cancers after prolonged, repeated, and heavy direct contact with the skin. Australias NSHOC reports: A number of studies have linked cancers of the skin and scrotum to mineral oil exposure. (Brit J Industr Med, 41, 437-444, 1984.)     2. Once the oil is absorbed, it is broken down by the liver, thus distracting the liver from other detoxifying chores. The liver helps your baby fend off sickness and toxicity.    3. Just having mineral oil around is a liability. If mineral oil is ingested, it will absorb (and essentially rob) vitamins from the intestinal tract  especially oil-soluble vitamins A, D and E. as well as beta-carotene, calcium, phosphorus and potassium and the blood coagulant Vitamin K. This could lead to nutritional deficiencies and other complications.     4. Ingested mineral oil also can impair lung function, a condition known as lipoid pneumonia (New England Journal of Medicine 1998; 339:1947-1948). Dr. Debra L. Bowen from the Food and Drug Administration says the agency requires manufacturers to label orally administered mineral-oil products as not for use in infants, and to warn against their use in young children or bedridden persons. Oddly enough, mineral oil is still widely prescribed by some pediatricians as a safe laxative for children.    I use olive, coconut and soybean oil sometimes even just plain vegetable in a pinch. I slowly heat the oil on the stove with chamomile flowers to make something calming heathly and nutritive. Using it plain also works. Check out http://www.compassionatechild.com/conten...
LeNeinDUaa	they really shoudl be as close to 2 months apart as possible. my babies 2 months was actually at 2.5 months so we scheduled her 4 month appt at 4.5 months so the shots are not too close together. call back, bring it to their attn. the receptionist prob didnt realize she had to take the shots into consideration.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	No, it will not hurt to have vaccines given late. Almost everyone I know who does get their baby vaccinated follows a very delayed schedule and I believe that is better for your baby. So, I'd say space them out as long as possible and get as few as possible at a time.|`|AA11210211	no it's not a problem my daughter just got her 1 yr shots and the lady told me to come back in August and I asked at the beginning or the end and she said it doesn't matter and that I could bring her in in September if I wanted:)|`|723QHuicaa	They prob wont give him the ones at 6m, they will keep the same amount of time in between vaccs - I would think.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	No it really shouldn't matter. They will most likely give him his 6 month shots a little later. As long as he gets them then he should be fine.|`|D3iXIgeNaa	It's not a big problem, but if you put off to long you child would have to receive multiple shots. But being a month or two off is really not a big deal. They probably will tell you to come back in a month or even up to 3 months so that you can catch up.|`|MeYILJeSaa	No, it's fine. My son also had his 2 month check-up at 2 1/2 months. He was in the hospital for a week after he was born-the pediatrician saw him every day when he was in the hospital so he didn't schedule him for later, therefore, it's all screwed up. It doesn't really hurt anything-if you think about it, the same amount of time goes by between the doctor seeing him, there's just a couple week difference. If they don't think anything is wrong with it, then I'm sure it's fine. The only problem with it is that you have to think more when trying to schedule appointments.
tDnD7Uqgaa	Well my daughter has a double name and I was raised in a southern way. I too have a double name and I love them my husband loves the way I carry myself and my daughter's friends all want her name. So the double name is great in my opinion.|`|TexOmGk3aa	They can be cute if you do it right. Make sure they don't sound stripper-y (friend's term). I think the name Bobbie Jo, and things similar, is atrocious.|`|zBaUWUXfaa	Not southern at all. Giving your child a double name is an honor. If done wrong it may sound sort of country, but when thought about with love and care a double name can be beautiful|`|mXhWvMveaa	I LUV EM!!! ESPECIALLY MARY-BETH!! OR ANYTHING MARY!!

nzyOCsOiaa	All moms want their kids to be perfect.  My dad is always saying "you're so fat now, stop eating."  my moms okay about it but dad's terrible.  My mom did tell me once that I was ugly though.  That really hurt. BAD.|`|WGAFP6mSaa	I don't think she really meant for you to be perfect. I think she's just expecting better out of you.    If she continues to say it, just ignore it. Be what you want to be..|`|87Dne23saa	maybe she just cares about you?|`|GxZVZLlHaa	Idk! My mom is like that too. Maybe just tell her "I am who I am, and you nor anyone else can change that."|`|KRDEbZmIaa	mother's always tell their children wut they have to be wut ever the parents think what is good best in the world o-o''    ur mother thinks being perfect is best thing in this world    its k i understand..just respect her (unfourtuantley T_T)  and just listein to wut she says. after that u have a choise of wut ever u want with out being notice by ur mother or just do wut ur mother says|`|wIp73JIjaa	I'm sure she doesn't expect you to be perfect, she just expects you to do the best you can. Be who you are, but be the best you can be overall, try to compromise. I'm sure you mother loves you very much and like every other parent she wants you to be happy and safe and successful.
r39EDGhPaa	I didn't even notice that.  All I know is this is so stupid, haha.  People are making a huge deal out of nothing.  Not to mention, no one cares about the other people in the photo squinting their eyes.. just her because she's famous and people are bored with their lives.    But you are right, the asian kid is doing wide eyes! In Hawaii, asians always called me round eye.  I never cared.|`|EccBqsntaa	When will you find something better to do? That actually is offensive to Asians. My best friend is half Filipino and she was really angry. Her little sister just said: She's just jealous because we're Asian! Think before you speak.|`|a0n9QXUraa	I'm slightly confused?  and people make a big deal out of everything they have nothing else better to do.|`|o3rTWrWPaa	i agree, i really dislike miley cyrus but they are just all having fun this is a joke nothing that anyone should get offended over.|`|87Dne23saa	the madness will end when everyone lets there diffrences go. who cares what your face looks like? your skin color? or clothes? everyone is the same, and everyone is diffrent.      thank-you very much for helping bring this to other yahooligans attention.|`|E7ViD8EWaa	Actually, after seeing that photo, it looks like all those people are squinting because someone turned the lamp behind them on at the same time as the flash went off, and Miley is pulling back her eyelids to see what she would look like Botox.    The madness never ends.|`|WIpeC3gRaa	This post is truly how I feel. If everyone is created equal, why are we still worried about race and our differences? I make those stupid faces all the time, but it has nothing to do with the fact that those are Asian eyes; it's something goofy I can show my friend while we're not paying attention in class. I really wish that people would just get a grip, get a life, and stop harassing people who clearly aren't doing anything wrong (had Miley done this while she were singing, she would have been clearly doing something wrong...she "sang" haha)|`|r0ISrLc1aa	people always just need something to get mad about.    it's never gonna end :( you just gotta learn to ignore it unfortunately.|`|v05RzzCEaa	seriously they need to leave her alone, i cant believe they actually made a huge story out of this! she is just taking some pictures and squinted her eyes... and thats racist how? ugh the media has gone crazy.
UghJ0XROaa	Did she just start sitting up completely unsupported and being able to pull herself up without any help at all?    Well anyway, if she did just accomplish that, she may be just kind showing off her new skill.     if not, if she is not crying let her in there, she may go back to sleep on her own without help from you. My daughter woke up numerous times overnight, but never cried, just went back to sleep, i don't know what she did in there, i just listened to her throught the baby monitor, but she never once cried(until she started getting baby "nightmares" at 13 months)      EDIT-everytime my daughter learned something new, like pulling herself up or anything, she would wake up more and more frequently but never cried. Just would do it a few times, then dose back off, wake up 2 hours later, then do it again. But never cried.|`|dFo0k3zDaa	First, nursing her everytime she wakes is only encouraging the waking... I know its hard, i've been there, but you need to find another way to soothe her back to sleep. Is she starting to crawl or walk? sometimes children just learning a new activity wake and are eager to try it again. my son did this a lot when he learned to crawl. moving her head back and forth may be a symptom of the teething or possibly an ear infection. Either one of those could cause her to wake as well.     Try just letting her stay in her crib and see what she does... you can watch her from the door or be there, but not seen, she may just go back to sleep on her own. I think that she only nurses for the comfort of it, she's not hungry, at that age she can sleep through the night with the calories she takes during the day.    Good luck, I know its hard, I've been there|`|J6IOqzL0aa	if she is happy in her crib and not fussing i think you should leave her in there. taking her out will get her in a bad habit and she will come to expect it.    when she wakes to nurse try and keep her up longer so she gets a proper feed. tickle her feet or change her nappy to wake her up when she falls asleep. hopefully she will eat more and then sleep better|`|8tagIO3aaa	if baby wakes up and does not cry leave baby be  and rest till baby cries and if baby cries it may need to be changed or is still hungry  we all twitch from time to time so i think that could be normal . if you are worried there is a problem take bay to the Dr. and tell him/her you concerns
uSk1IS0iaa	healthplans.my-age.net - try this one. My wife had no problem with her insurance coverage while being pregnant.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	I wasn't working when I had my son, and we both went on public aid here in Illinois, and it was surprisingly good insurance. He only needed a pediatrician, and didn't have any other problems. They usually don't recommend a baby going to the dentist until they're closer to 2 or 3 or at least until they have more than 1 or 2 teeth lol, so they may sit better for the dentist. That was the only doctor my son needed...sorry I couldn't be more help with the insurance!|`|gaiCNtEFaa	First off you don't need a dentist until the child is 2-3 years old.  The only Dr. a baby should need is a pediatrician or family practitioner. If god forbid there is something wrong your primary care will refer you to some one else.      As for buying health insurance I can't help you there.  We get it through my husbands work and it is great. Sorry.|`|U9zgOGVuaa	healthplans.bebto.com - try this one. My wife had no problem with her insurance coverage while being pregnant.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	yes you're baby needs a pediatrician...and not a dentist for quite some time but, it's still a smart idea to have one on the plan. I went to the eye doctor recently and I am pregnant, and my eye doctor told me babies are supposed to go for their first eye appointment when they are 6 months, so I guess you should keep that in mind. There are many different insurance companies, I'm sure the hospital that you are delivering at or the doctors/midwives you are currently seeing during your pregnancy can give you information on insurance for your baby.    congrats and good luck=)

Your other daughter may be jealous of the attention you are giving to her sister because of her speech problem.  try giving her more attention she may feel your not giving her.|`|UTid4FyCaa	This is very horrible.  However, it is a symptom of an emotional response that needs to be dealt with.  Are they close?  What is the age?  If they are tweens this needs to be addressed.  She may feel embarressed, an audult should help her sort through these feelings.  But it should not be acceptable to make fun of her sister.|`|kuXRD3OVaa	spank her and talk to her about her wrong.|`|zSo7fvGKaa	tell her how mean shes being  and ask her how shed like it if shed gotten the same thing as her sister!  tell her its not her fault tht her sister has that  and also ask her howd she like her sister to help her firnes make fun of her!  just make her feel guilty then send her to her room to think about it!  tho siblings arent always nice with each other  embarassing each other in front of others is rude and down right hurtfuk to each other!|`|f5a325bd71925b68d42a9d6bc17b3289aa	Talk to her about it she may have been joining it to not be embarassed when others started. Let her know how mean it is to make fun of others espicially your own sister.
jOyzcJd7aa	I'm only 12 weeks and I already have this problem! It's soooo frustrating! Makes me feel like I'm not attractive or something. & his excuse is that he's to tired, jeeze take it for the team! I did it so many times when I was tired and it sucks that he won't do it for me...|`|FLOjzbKEaa	may be he is afraid he will hurt the baby by having sex.|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	take him to you're next doctor's appointment & just ask you're doctor in front of him that is it ok to have sex during this time?  he/she would say yes,it is safe.that might change you're bf's mind.  hope this works !|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My husband was the same way with me during all of my pregnancies. It is not all in your head....it is all in his head. My husband had every excuse under the sun not to have sex while I was pregnant, what it boiled down to was that he had it in his head that some how he was going to hurt the baby and he just did not feel right about it knowing the baby was in there, even after the doctor telling him this is not possible, he never "gave it up". It sucks but something you can't convince him to do!|`|ltst5ELYaa	this happend to me too!  hes afriad hes gonna hit the babys head while hes enjoying himself.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	Sorry to say this but some men are like this, as soon as i started showing around 6 months he just cut off! seriously! And i was pissed because i was pregnant and had all those hormones and emotions going through me! ad boy did i get hateful with him too!! I feel bad now...lol But i remember him saying he thought he would hurt the baby and that he just didnt want to make anything go wrong. Even the doctor tried to tell him it was healthy for sex during pregnancy but he wasnt having it. we didnt have sex again until it was like 3 months after the birth of our daughter.  your just going to have to ride it out, your bf might not budge i know mine didnt
AA12206581	okay so either she likes you back, or she doesnt like you and still wants it to ba a normal friendship. right now im in the second situationwith a couple of guys i know that like me. just text her and kinda flirt with her, maybe it will become more, i know mine wont become more. but maybe she will fall for you.?|`|FGZR9RwDaa	i would text someone i didn't like..|`|v05RzzCEaa	i would text someone i didnt like back just very casually though.  uhm cant really tell if she likes you or not, not enough information.|`|EccBqsntaa	Um..Yeah. I guess|`|zprMdpxZaa	im not a girl but this is obvious to anyone, just becasue she is testing you doesnt mean she has to like you. She is still talking to you because she could like you as a friend    Who knows if she likes you back, try asking her.|`|fU4pOpeHaa	Um. SURE? and i yes i text guys i don't like.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	She might... or she may just like you as a friend... ask her??|`|87Dne23saa	ask her. not us. && dont feel nervous abot it.    there is only one way to be sure, we cannot tell you!|`|OaRR9qoSaa	yeah i would text them, but only as friends|`|pkjtAhA5aa	I text alot of boys i dont like, and a few that i dispise of..but gotta be friendly! and she might like you back.
bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	I'm married and my husband comes first for the most part. We both tend to put the kids first if they are sick or when they were babies. I guess you could really say we put their needs before our own.  If he were to ever abuse my children, however they would come first and he better say his prayers.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Yeah thats a tricky one i think im going to have to be a fence sitter!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Alright, here comes my cynical, realistic, personal experience side. Yes, your child comes first. Because...in my life at least the waking up for the next 50years kind of relationship does not exist. If they are my soul mate or whatever they can take things on my terms and go as slowly as necessary for the comfort of myself and my child. Since I don't believe that is likely they will probably leave saving me the trouble of ditching them later when I realize what a jerk they really are. I wouldn't trust anyone I met or even fell in love with enough to ever put them equal or above my child. Just wouldn't happen. That said, if my child had a malicious streak and just wanted to break me up with anyone and everyone I'd have some serious talks with them about it.|`|eEK3m1aXaa	I come from a broken home. My parents divorced when I was, maybe, 6 months old, so I don't know any other dad besides my step dad. My brother and I did spend every other weekend with my real dad and step mom, but my dad, is my step father. My mom has always had a special relationship with my brother and I. She never openly told us that we came/come first but I really do believe that we always have and will. I highly doubt she ever told my dad that though as she has a different kind of love for him than she does for her children.    The best thing I've ever heard, to best suit your question, was one time at a business meeting. Our friend, Jeremy, was talking about a time when he was younger and he was so mad at his mom that he shoved her and she hit against a wall and slightly hurt herself. When Jeremy's dad got home, his mom told his dad what had happened. His dad went outside and asked his son, "Why did you shove your mom?" Jeremy said, "She's my mom. I can shove her if I want to." To which his dad replied, "She's your mom BUT she's MY wife and I will do anything in my power to protect her."    I agree with you that his daughter, if she doesn't like the new girlfriend, will do her best to sabotage the new relationship. I think it'd be okay to let his girlfriend know that his little girl comes first, but not to tell his little girl that. She may take that into extremes and it might come back to bite him in the a$s.      Did any of this make sense??  :)        ~_~|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I don't know how I feel about it either. On one hand a child is forever and people do get divorced... My daughter is 14 months old and I do put her first to the point its a flaw of mine. I recently made the decision to hire a babysitter so we could go out once a month and keep our marriage on track.    Your spouse is supposed to be  1 and kids are a welcome addition to the family, but its hard to do sometimes.    I think its good for now for his daughter to know she is  1, but once daddy gets serious in a relationship his priorities might shift a tiny bit and they can become equals.|`|M6c0hUefaa	Hmm, that's tough and I guess it could be looked at differently with every child.    My mom and dad divorced when my brother was 4 and I was 10 months. From as early as I can remember my dad made it clear no matter how many women he dated my brother and I were his "number ones"....and that he loved us more than anything in the world. That being said, my father dated a pretty good bit, especially while we were younger, and neither my brother nor myself ever felt compelled to sabotage his relationship. I feel my dad showed us enough love even while he was with other women for both of us to feel comfortable with her and not feel pushed aside or less loved. I can, however, understand some children that might feel that way given their own personalities and the child/parent relationship as a whole.    I love my partner and I love my daughter but to compare to each which is more, is hard. It's a different love I have for my daughter compared to the love I have for her father, so to do that would almost be impossible for me.|`|2arZOZWgaa	This situation I think is different from the perceived "normal family," where the father of child is married or at least with the mother of the child. In that case, I think the marital relationship should come first. This is because the father needs to take of the mother so that she in return can take of the child. Kind of like the old saying, "if mama ain't happy ain't nobody happy." The child is of course a very close second.    But in this case, where the child already has a mother, the father's time should be more concentrated toward his child than another woman, not the mother of his child. He is probably going with his heart on this one because he most likely put the child's mother first in their relationship and watched it turn sour at the expense of the child and does not want that to happen again. He therefore puts his child first this time because she will always be in his life.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	No. Your spouse comes first always. This is even in the bible.    Genesis 2:24  For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.    Your children will move on your spouse does not.     When you put your spouse first your children learn from this and are able to apply this in their own lives later down the road.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	I am with a man that has a 4-year old son from a previous relationship. We are expecting ourselves in June! We have been together for quite some time and it's hard to explain our relationship. I don't want to say he puts any of us "first". It's not like that with him. If me and my fiance were together and something happened to his son, we'd both be there in an instant! And if myself, my fiance and his son were all together and something happened to me, my fiance would react immediately as well. If his son could be there depending on the situation then he would, and if not my fiance would make immediate plans for someone to be with is son, or for his mother to get him. Thankfully, his mother and her husband and myself and my fiance all get along rather well and have a nice relationship among each other. This really helps for my fiance's son and it's nice to see that relationships can be built like this, esp. for the child.     I am not for putting anyone first. And, if it's a real life partner and somebody you want to spend the rest of your life with then no, there is no putting anyone first.|`|rAkWoweOaa	They are two completely different kinds of relationships. My husband has a daughter from a previous marriage and she goes in between us all the time, but her dad knows what she is doing. He loves her and me, and lets both of us know that. He said when I married him that it was not a competition. He is her father, but he is my husband. Fathers do not need to let their children ruin a potentially great relationship. Everybody will eventually have to get along.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	YES they come before any one. If I had to choose between my boys and my husband it would be my boys no questions asked. And my husband is the greatest and the only person who was always there for me. And I also feel that if this spouse of his (or soon to be or what ever) cannot understand and except that his daughter is 1st then she is not the "real deal" or "the right one" for him. I also think that your in law is an amazing man and no hands down should have at least part custody of his little girl. There are not many men out there who feel this way.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	yes. she's my baby, my flesh and blood. until she's an adult, I think she will always come first. she cant fend for herself yet. even when shes 12, she will still come first. until she's out of the house and in her own life, will i put a man first before my own child, and it has to be a very good man at that!|`|vOomJtbsaa	Hey Mama Lisee Loo!  The situation isn't ideal.   Ideally we stay with the parents of our children.  I have first hand experience with this as I come from a broken home with parents that are both remarried.   It's really tough on the spouses as well as the children.  And yes making her "Daddies little princess"  could take its toll on any of his relationships, but it doesn't sound like he's looking to date seriously, and women that are in it for a casual time may not mind being second.  However, I know that if I were to split with my fiance, as selfish as it sounds I'd want to rake just as high on the list as his children.   So to answer your question, ultimately no children should not come before a long term spouse.  They should all be prioritized and included.  The best thing he can do is to include his little girl on dates, and visa versa, include his spouse on his dates with his daughter.  I don't think there's any black/white answer to this one, the areas in between are very grey.  I'd always want to be included (heaven forbid I split with my fiance) and on the other hand I'd probably always put my son first if embarking down the road in a new relationship.... it just would feel unnatural to do anything else, considering he's my flesh and blood.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I would hope he'd temper those feelings (which is great, BTW!) with a healthy dose of discipline, too. People should put their kids first - that's why you have wackos like Susan Smith and Casey Anthony running around who kill their kids because of some dumb man. Or put up with a man who doesn't like their kids. I can't understand that crap.     I think as long as he raises her with expectations of her behavior and sets limits, just like anyone else would, it's okay for her to be first in his life, and that's nice. Not everyone feels that strongly about their kids when it comes to romantic relationships, and maybe they should.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	I think if the child is there before a relationship start (as per with your brother in law) then i think yes, the child should come first. But in a relationship like mine (my fiance and i had our baby together) then they are equal in my eyes and i would not favour one over the other.  If my fiance and i wer to break up then she would absoluely come first, no question there.|`|iH2whFkHaa	I was 14 years old when my mom married my stepdad. This situation is not so easy and clear cut as it seems. It depends on a lot of things. For instance how the other person treats the child, or how old the kid is when the person becomes involved. Using myself as an example: I was 14 and had already spent the last 5 years without a dad. I was absolutely ok with my mom getting married but when my stepdad started trying to put rules on me and talk to me rudely as if he had known me all my life and he had a right to, that was the dealbreaker and he seriously came between me and my mother, which in my opinion; the relationship between me and my mom is more important that the one he has with her. My mom rejected me because she didn't understand that by disliking him I wasn't trying to come between her and Matt; I just thought that he should have had to form a relationship as a father with me before he had the right to order me around. So my mother didn't consider me above him and it drove me far, far away from her. To this day it still does. And it still hurts.    Just because the child's well being is above all else doesn't mean a good balance can't be found. There is a solution to everything on this earth. However if I had to sacrifice my happiness for that of my child I would do it in a heartbeat.|`|AzdAvDW1aa	sure|`|jkDbDjcRaa	My daughter is  1.  Has been since she was born.  I'm still with her father...but if I ever had to kick him out in order to make life better for my child, protect her, or for any reason, I would do it in a heartbeat.|`|nYI8eB0Baa	Kid comes first...period!|`|pmNYvpUcaa	being a mother i really think that your children come first, but if it is about your life partner then they should be treated equally because sooner or later your children will leave you and have a life of their own so they should both be your  1 priority|`|iQrZUVs1aa	I dont think that parents should tell their child that they have free reign over their relationship but I think there is a healthy way to allow the child to know she is important.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	I think it depends on the situation. They should definitely be more important sometimes, but sometimes not.|`|b8Mfl9UZaa	I think it's hard to answer this. Kids are on a different level than significant others. Looking at my parents relationship I see that with my dad we (kids) come first. Looking at my sister and her child he (the kid) definitely comes first. What single parents need to make their kids realize is that they will date and that there has to be room for someone else in their life too. But dating life should be kept separate. I don't have kids that's just how I feel. And his daughter will have been in his life for longer than any other woman that comes in at this point so whoever comes in has to realize that she's coming into a family, not just a man. Kids come first to a lot of parents, the relationship needs to be established and maybe he shouldn't treat her like a princess and actually lay down ground rules and discipline like we had when I was a kid.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I talked about it with my husband before because his mom dated a lot of guys when he was growing up. ( I mean not a lot lot but several, some serious some not)  I think that young children come first, even in our relationship our kids needs come first. Like if we had plans but someone is sick, we cancel and stay home to take care of the kid, if there is a school play etc we go etc..   If I had to start dating I would put my kids first in a way, not that they would have a say who I would date but if you date me you pretty much date my kids too so if you arent nice to them, I wouldnt go out with you and stuff like that.   But you are right, kids are smart and can try to use stuff like that so I wouldnt be announcing it to everyone, just keeping it for myself|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	My hubby the father of both of my children comes first. My kids also come first. A future partner if there ever was one would not come before my kids. I would never put anyone before my relationships with my family. I met and fell in love with my husband before we had kids. I also have unstoppable love for my babies. I would let no harm come to either. But if there was a future mate they would have to understand that my kids come first and if he had kids I would Expect the same from him.|`|wBpennsMaa	Your children ALWAYS come before your needs, and that includes your "need" to have a partner. You can't trust that you will wake up to that same person for the next 50 years and someone who already has children with someone else knows that, whereas your children always count on you. Even when your children are out of the house and starting their own family: they are the most important thing to you.|`|KHOsfLM9aa	Kids come first ALWAYS|`|nCKdkYSyaa	Honestly My whole life is my husband and my daughter. We are a family, and if for some reason we break, My whole life becomes my DAUGHTER. Future spouse or not I already made a comitment BEFORE i got with the future spouse when I gave birth to my daughter, Thats just how i see it.  BUT im also one of those woman who if my husband and I dont make it, Im happy without a man, sure i will be lonely sometimes but i wont be out looking for other men at all. I have more important things in my life to keep me happy.  thats just how i see it :)    EDIT: Alyssa's mom nailed on the head with this "Your spouse is supposed to be  1 and kids are a welcome addition to the family, but its hard to do sometimes."    That is something so true but SO HARD that a woman, let alone a MOTHER has to go through, Because our children are OUR hearts and its hard to share them with someone else (their father)  and its hard because sometimes we have to back away and let the father help raise the children too.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I definitely put my daughter first before my fiance. To him, our daughter comes first, I come second. It is a mutual understanding and we never felt like she comes in between us. We just want the best for her and if she is happy than we are happy.|`|dTLTNZTzaa	Men (or women) come and go and kids are forever. And as much as my little one comes before my husband for me, she comes first when it comes to me for my husband. And that is right. And normal person would not even be jealous. And kids have to know that they come first.|`|sAAnquoTaa	Well I'm a little torn onthis one.      I guess when they're very little they should come first, but as they get older you have to start giving the attention back to your so and let your child know you still love them just as much and will never stop, but it's time to have time with the other parent or stepparent.
puCOYwMmaa	Aww that's really cute!  I like rats, they're super smart.    Bamboo is more absorbent than cotton, and antimicrobial which may be a good choice in case of accidents.    I don't know much about hemp.    Do rats chew fabric? (I'm wondering because I had a pet rabbit who chewed on fabric and shoes)  if so then cotton might be the better choice economically if you have to to repair jobs.|`|AA12254884	Bamboo|`|yeFZzstvaa	Hahah I am making a hammock for my rats.

74pfB2Bnaa	Typically something is given that will last throughout life or at least throughout childhood:   - My parents give every of their grandchildren and godchildren a set of silverware with the infant's name engraved into it.   - If the infant is a girl a cross shaped pendant is a typical gift.  - A Children's' Bible makes a nice gift, especially one with nice pictures.  - A fruit tree planted into the parents garden.  - It's also fine to give something baby will only need later in life as long as it fits in the theme.     The size of your gift depends a bit on your relationship to the infant, if you are the godmother typically you'd give more generously ($50-100). If you are just family or friends ($10-30).|`|xRZkgU8Caa	Savings Bonds, cash, scrapbooks, silver engraved rattle|`|IpkUUxdNaa	A Bible and/or a cross|`|ftbrRTYUaa	My children got savings bonds, a crosses and when they are confirmed they will get the chain for it, stool with their name on it for their beds and also money.|`|723QHuicaa	We got 20 from friends and relatives in cards.

A picture frame, a book of prayers, etc.  Visit a Christian book store for more ideas/suggestions.|`|tkqGwbtHaa	just get a nice silver rattle, if you want to personalize it you can get it engraved at almost any jewelry store.    or hey, why not put money into a bond for him. the baby will appreciate it SO much when college comes around! i wish someone would have done that for me!|`|A89ezcg5aa	My son got a children's bible with pictures, a little plaque with a picture and a little scripture, a teddy bear, and money.
K5TrkUhCaa	No, I do not think that 11 year olds should be having sex.    No, I do not believe that teen pregnancy is a good thing.    I think Sex Ed should start being taught before high school as well as every year of high school.|`|14JQ11AUaa	I personally think that once you are of age and can make the choice to do what you want...then it is ok. At 11, they are barely in middle school. Some 11 year olds have yet to start their menstrual cycle. They are not mature enough to participate in an adult activity, like sexual intercourse! I am not saying sex is an activity, it is just an expression so bare with me. Teen pregnancy, well it CAN be a GOOD thing! I was 18 when I got pregnant, granted I was of age, I was still a teen. It totally changed my life around for the good. My son helped me become a wonderful person and a great mother! I think with that being said it all depends on the teen! As for the sex ed question, 5th grade is when it should start being taught...once they hit middle school hormones start racing, then puberty happens!|`|816TYl4eaa	umm no    no    my school it was the 6th grade|`|G6p7QSedaa	1.No   and being a mother of an eleven year old the thought makes me sick to my stomach  2.That's a tricky question  3. middle school|`|4lsp4dtRaa	11 yr olds should not be having sex there still a child its bullshit no way i dont agree, teen pregnanacy no way too young children having children. when i was in school they started teaching us in the first yr of high school i was 13 yrs old.|`|nluNSDI4aa	no.    no, because they have their whole life's ahead of them. Sex, babies, and boys will always be there.     Nowadays kids are having sex from a young age. I mean young. or at least talking about it. Sex ed should be started during 7th grade i believe. Because once you really get into school, that when per-pressure comes and curiosity. HIV and other STD's are real and out there. They need to know what can be the consequences or responsibilities of their actions.Though parents should always talk to their kids about sex, with or without the sex ed class. and warn them.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	hell no.    no, cause most teens arent married.    5th or 6th grade|`|YT48OTKzaa	no, first of all there body is not ready for that kind of thing and there mind is not   muture anough to handle this type of thing  and they should think about making something out of there self.  then to think about something that they shoul'd be doning to they get married. no teen age pregnancy is nt a good thing becous one they trowing away there life they cant have fun they cant do thing that they want do they cant  finshe school they wont be abe to go out with there friends there loose there friend it a lot to been a teenage mother.so no it's not a good thing.they way things goning early as ossible but with the right teacher like maybe a ciredifide doctor|`|ZU7rn7RHaa	No...11 year olds shouldn't be having sexual intercourse.  No it's not a good thing at all.  I say it should start by the 6th grade.|`|FSPAKELyaa	11 is too young, far too young.     Teen pregnancy is not a good idea, teen parents are usually doing it for the wrong reasons, and in alot of situations the relationship breaks down and the children are left in single parent households on a low income.     And i dont have an opiion on sex ed in school, i have been open with my children as far as if they ask i tell them in age approriate stages.|`|MqFeJiukaa	no, no, and 4th or 5th grade.  I feel like this is a joke because who the hell thinks yes to the first 2 questions?|`|x4uGfC4oaa	1. Absolutely not. There is no 11-year-old who is physically, mentally, or emotionally ready for a baby.    2. No. Usually other people end up taking care of the baby.    3. They shouldn't have to teach sex ed. Parents should be honest with their children about that, and they should have the knowledge to teach their own children. I think we were first taught around fifth grade and it was awkward. That awkwardness was a good thing; it made us less apt to try it.

ZncV5gc0aa	No it wouldn't be too much to ask for. I promised my son he will get a new car the day he graduates from high school. (Gotta set him up with a safe car for college) I think she should get it now though since she's going to most likely be getting an income tax check. You will need a good car for college.   She promised this to you so at least talk to her about it. Maybe she can come up with a down payment and you can make the monthly car notes and insurance.|`|NJqH1PCNaa	Im in grade 12 too, I work 3 days a week and make like $600 every 2 weeks, me and my bro are going to take over someones lease for a mustang and its like $400 a month ( no down payment ) maybe u could try that. I know some ppl say teens shouldnt lease, but some guy at my school leases his car so I think its alright.     btw taking over someones lease is better than leasing from a dealership because the guy already pays the downpayment, all you have to pay is a small transfer fee like $150    theres websites, where you can search for cars to lease taker over. ( swapalease.com )|`|qHMBkLx2aa	She didn't exactly promise to get you a car right?    I'd say given your family's current financial situation, a car is certainly too much to ask for. Since you say you sit at home for most of the day, try going out and getting a job. Show your parents that you can take responsibility for yourself and that you deserve a car.    Edit: Well since she won't let you get a car, do a bit of research. Find a cheaper car on autotrader.com or craigslist.com and try to work out a deal with your mom. Maybe even let her let you get a job so you could make low payments on it? Either way, the best thing you can do is sit down with her and have a heart to heart.|`|S6P9gSX8aa	you might have to realize that they just dont have the money.. i would get a job.. at least have them meet you half way..|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I'm sorry, but you sound rather spoiled.  Thanks in advance for the thumb's down!|`|aTyNsdApaa	I think you need to grow up! Go get a job and buy your own car. I got a job and bought my first car. I think your a brat and that you don't deserve a penny.|`|shBj5RElaa	yes it is to much|`|HLPXZ9Btaa	Honey, my parents didn't have any problems your parents dealing with now but still they didn't get me a car !!!|`|3g1y1Ahhaa	A car is not a lot to ask for. i mean a lot of people get cars when theyre 16 so i dont see what the problem is.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	Once you get 18, you can get a job regardless if your mom wants you or not. If you have to, you can get a job and see if you two can work out a deal.     There are used dealerships you can buy from or maybe a used car lot, just bring someone that is car smart so you don't get jipped!    Your mom might not be able to afford it by herself so once your 18 you can get a job and can help with the payments.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	Well then she should live up to her word; even if it's a crappy car. Why won't she let you get a job? I'd start looking for jobs and then I'd approach the issue again. I feel bad for those seniors that are still riding the school bus =/. I've always had a car but then again, my grandmas inheritance paid for it and money has never been an issue. That and most of the time I take public transit. Also, what are your plans for college? That should influence you wanting a car or not; keeping a car on campus at my college is $300 per term or $900 a year. Good luck! =]
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	2/10.I dont really like that Name,sorry..|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I love the name. I would rate it an 8|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Haha, I know a really sweet guy named Colton. I like it better with a C, though.|`|mtmGvlTAaa	its cool|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Great choice but please spell it Colton!|`|KOcCenrEaa	nine point five.  I prefer it spelled Colton rather Kolton.

Ty6vGEj9aa	I use bleach mixed with some water.  I just can't stand the smell of either vinegar or pee...why put them together? ;)|`|Rzsudrzqaa	I've been there lol.    There are many cleaning products designed specifically for urine but the vinegar or baking soda mixtures work well... except everything will smell like vinegar for a while lol.    Best solution (for the future)... buy some mattress protectors to put under your sheets. They are sooo worth it. I've got five kids and there have been many bodily fluids on their beds (uhhhh)....|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Don't you just love children?  my daughter did that to me one night, only i had the pee on me too... grrrr  i've used carpet cleaner on the mattress.  over and over. then duct tape for the diaper.  lol j/k|`|6XFnwAlLaa	keep it out in the sun for the whole day .|`|prqrQcd1aa	I would honestly get a carpet cleaner that has an upholstery hose on it, that was what i did and it works wonders for getting pee and anything else out of floors and mattresses. It's also a great thing to have around when you have kids!|`|rISHTfK3aa	Use bicarbonate  of soda, it really works.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	The first poster is right, vinegar will work.  Personally, I use a bleach/water mix in a spray bottle, but my mattress is plain white so I don't have to worry about making any colors run.  After that, I use Febreeze to make it smell better.  I usually stand the mattress up on its side and do both sides, in case the wetness soaked all the way through the mattress.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	vinegar will get the smell out.      Just blot as much as you can, then I put vinegar in a spray bottle with a bit of water and spray on the area, blot again, spray again.|`|723QHuicaa	scrub scrub scrub!    And look into getting a mattress protector so if he does it again, its only the sheet you need to wash.
2xS1Jro7aa	This is how I potty trained 3 boys with no problems. I took them to walmart and let them pick out a few new cars and small toys that could only be played with on the potty. We had them sit backwards on the big potty (that way their pee did not go over the seat and onto the floor) and they would play with their toys on the back of the potty until they went. They sat on the toilet every hour and when they went potty we waited an hour and a half in that hour they would have lots and lots of water it helped them to learn when they had to go and how it felt. A few days of doing this they started telling us when they had to go potty then about a week later they would go potty on their own.   And pooping came soon after! And go right to big boy undies while you are doing it and let him pick out some fun undies so hes excited to wear them! For the first boy we tried the little potty but he got really board with it after a few days and never went to the bathroom on it. Good luck!|`|AA11611165	The fruit loop target game thing, is really smart. I started at like 24 months. i let him run around naked then when he started peeing or pooping, Say NO! and run him to he toilet. lol. It worked!|`|efMkbRCuaa	Sit him on the potty first thing in the morning. (I'm assuming he is staying dry all night!) If he goes, make a big deal over it. Clap, sing, dance, etc. Then put him in underwear. Pull-ups are just expensive diapers!! Give him plenty to drink and then sit him on the potty every 30-45 min. He will have quite a few accidents at first,but he should get the hang of it pretty quickly!  I potty trained my first son at 2 years old. It took him two weeks to fully potty train. I trained my second at 16 months and it took him also about two weeks to fully potty train.   Best of luck!|`|3gDiRoNwaa	You are starting at a good time.I let my go to the bathroom with men i trust like my dad ,his dad and my brothers and this may sound funny but the first time he actually went was when my brother went out side he thought that was cool and he went outside the only thing is he wanted to use the potty out side all the time.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	a friend of mine put fruit loops in the toilet and the boy had to hit the fruit loops with pee - worked with the boy sitting - lol he loved holding his ~~ down and aiming!!!!
o0Q7LmMsaa	you could try to start talking to her in more spanish  then after you say what you want to say to her translate it in english right after so she knows what you want  then you can take her to the library and read books  rent movies that are in spanish  label  household items with the spanish word on it  for example if the item is a cookie jar write cookie jar on a post it and ut it on there.  just make it fun, don't stress it on her.    from my experiences i work at a daycare (every summer)  i teach the little kids phrases in spanish and some french just for fun!  when i speak to the kids that don't speak the language they look at me funny and say "what" it's so cute  but anyways, i used to teach them a new word everyday  and now when i ask them what the word is in spanish they say it and what it means in english, they are around the same age too  they are very excited, i know a very lil ASL (american sign language) but  teach them some words that i know also and they love it  as long as you make it fun she will want to learn it , little kids love to learn and to do anything that is fun!    good luck =)|`|r0ISrLc1aa	you and your family should talk spanish around her. when she asks you what youre saying, be like youll have to learn spanish to find out. eventually she'll start trying. :)|`|horefBCyaa	well you can't force her to learn it. that's kinda difficult. but i'm sure being around them long enough-she'll pick up on the language. she's young enough that she can learn a lot. i mean i'm all caucasian and was over at my boyfriend's (who is from mexico) house every day for about 2 1/2-3 years and i started picking up on the language because him and and his sisters were the only ones in his whole family who spoke english.|`|2djVdpnKaa	Find something she enjoys that is in Spanish, but not English or Chinese. For instance, what made me really want to put my all into Spanish is books. I love to read, but things get lost in translation, so I really wanted to learn Spanish fluently, so I could read them in the original language.
EvRIwz4Laa	I had the same issue. At 6 weeks with twins I was 5'2 (which obviously did not change lol) and I weighed 83lbs. I have always eaten normally and healthier than most but my BMI was very low. The doctor explained to me that the danger with a low BMI is expressed in a J curve which basically means that if you BMI is too low your risk of illness including heart related aliments is higher at a low BMI closer to normal than it would be for someone over weight. Anywho, the end result was that 1. I was considered a high risk pregnancy which meant that I had to see a OB which specializes in high risk pregnancy (and she was AWESOME and I am glad I got to see her) and 2. I have to gain more weight in the first trimester than most. Which was no problem since I was preggers and I wanted to eat everything in sight lol ;) but I lost the weight very quickly and in a healthy way. now two beautiful baby girls and 10 months later...My body looks better than it has ever looked my BMI is much closer to healthy than it was before and I love my perfectly healthy usually happy ;) babies|`|kxUigIkraa	If you are eating normally (1500 calories a day for a pregnant woman your size) and gain the recommended 25 pounds (at your current weight), then there would be nothing to worry about.|`|UeffSgRuaa	my friend weighed about 105 pounds and was 5'6 and at the end of her pregnancy she was 160 pounds. The baby should be fine.|`|k8HVgVdnaa	this will not be good because the baby might be too skinny.|`|5ORyLk4Uaa	no your height and weight before your pregnant will not effect the baby. your weight grows while your baby grows.|`|twVyisGnaa	Sometimes, you do have to eat a little more.  You are gonna have to eat for 2 people now.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    no wieght and hieght dont affect babies health. Every one gains weight as they go along at their own pace.    Speak to your doctor about your weight if want to to. He may want you to eat more of a certain food or something.    god bless x Take care|`|1MgpiqfJaa	no everybody is different..just eat healthy and take care of youself|`|kaqPSgTVaa	The doctor is going to want you to gain more weight than most women. As long as you gain weight you should be ok. You doctor can help give you tips on gaining weight.|`|npWGkuwnaa	No not at all.I was very under weight when I conceived my children. I didn't diet I was that way naturally. I ate healthy and had two good sized babies.
tyqN6qBUaa	I had the same issue in my house. I cannot stand the word, and you could guarantee you'd be hearing it. Hell, my two best friends from 5th to 7th grade were black, and my dad could not deal with it. My mom always tried to claim she had no problem with black people, but she used the term pretty loosely, so I was always calling her out on it. But you can't do anything about it, other than apologize for them in public (away from your parents, obviously), if it's warranted, and just keep yourself from using it. You can't change their beliefs at this point, so you can either keep fruitlessly asking them to stop using the word, or ignore it. Although if I recall, I did keep asking, until I moved out, and didn't have to deal with their obnoxiousness every day.|`|87Dne23saa	just ask them to stop, or at least around you. do it nicely, not whiney. take maturity, i totally agree.|`|UChvBRU1aa	make black friends  hang out with them  bring them over  maybe they'll stop  at least the need to  we are in the freaking 21st century|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i believe they have a "short temper" - to use a word like that a person is obviously not taking the time to really think before reacting (verbally or otherwise). you could always say that that word makes you feel uncomfortable, you could leave the room when they use it, or you could ignore it. but you cannot really make anyone do anything. maybe they are angry at something else and are using the strong language because they have a hard time expressing their real concerns. maybe the music you listen to is offensive..(i don't know if it is or not). either way - you have a choice about listening to them or not.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Tell them to quit listening to Cracker music.|`|l1STgPyRaa	really i would just take pity on them for their lack of intelligences.    Maybe just bide your time and have your friends and have your own life enjoy it don't let them effect your quality of life and maybe tell them it is not your fault that you are smarter then they are just course your not unintelligent as they are.    When you are older so that you can leave then you are free but really their is no way to change someone that does not wish to change or do not think that they have any reason to change really. sorry to say but it is the way things are.     if they go one about IQ's or anything like that then i would look for a Special IQ test that was designated for African Americans unlike the normal one that is meant for White's     I wish you luck with this issue|`|OGLulBtwaa	just git your teeth and politely ask them to stop saying around you because unfortunately they are your parents. :-/  my family was like that for a little while, then i brought home my Jamaican boyfriend lol, but now they love him!|`|DkT8znckaa	Try to have a good conversation with them about race and racism. IF you live in the south, it might have been how they are raised, but considering they use the terms in negative ways, maybe they are a bit racist. (Some people use the n word in place of friend, man, or "black guy" because that's what they know, it doesn't mean they hate all blacks. I know white people who use the word and have best friends that are black, it's just how they were raised.) I talked to my parents about their views on race and how they were affecting me just this weekend. My parents aren't totally for interracial relationships either. They always complain about "Why is that black guy with that white girl?" and it bothers me a lot. (That's a lame example, my parents aren't racists, I don't want to make them look bad so I won't say some other things they've said that could be misunderstood) My parents and I talked a lot about it, and since then my mom's been watching her wording more. Next time one of them says something like that ask them "What makes you say that?" They might not get defensive. But really, they are adults, and they have the right to say whatever they want, so you can't make them stop. Sorry, I missed the part about the short temper. If they get mad, then maybe calmly say "I'm not being critical of you, I'm just curious." And then share your views. They might not have as short of tempers as you think.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Ignore it. They will never change. One side of my family is like that, and trying to make them understand only starts arguments. When they start, block it out. Don't let it get to you. ??|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	wow. I am so sorry for what you have to hear. Tell them it offends you. If that wont work then call them crackers lol j/k maybe you could bring them on the tyra banks show or maury or steve wilcos show.|`|v05RzzCEaa	tell them to "shut it crackers!"|`|F47MyGDSaa	Maybe you can polietly talk to them. Calmy try "Mom, ____ (step dad's name), is there any way you wouldn't say the N word in front of me? I know you don't like the race (or use an acceptable word) but it offends me too when you say that.    Or I know it might be hard, but try to ignore it, even if it does offend you. It offends a lot of people too.    good luck.|`|pcjOQDymaa	wow, okay try to explain to them how offensive it is.  or make them watch a movie about that.   IDK lol never really come across anyone who still does that.|`|vdPTAxmDaa	I wish I had such a problem. white power.|`|a0n9QXUraa	just say...do you know that you're being a real n word right now...  b.c the n word in the dictinary is actualy ignorant...  no lie...    but maybeh you shouldnt say that.....  just tell them it offends you...  see how they react....    i hate that dang word...  and all racists...=/
iMULlxdgaa	hormones wil fluctuate and I myself have felt this way I'm 37 weeks prego and sometimes I still forget i'm prego (then I look down and see my belly...but seriously you don't feel prego  like all the time.  I have friedns that have been the same way.  don't worry.  as long as your blood work comes out good and your doctor feels everythingis progressing normally you'll be ok.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	symptoms don't have to be everyday IF you have any.    my daughter didn't give me any symptomss but this baby, my son, has given me a pretty hard time.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Yes, some of my symptoms come and go throughout this pregnancy.  For instance, some days my breasts are super sore and then other times they feel fine.  It's perfectly normal.|`|ejxCPI43aa	no, sorry, when i was pregnant and didnt know its was constant symptomes. the main one was i was ALWAYS cold !!. and tired !! goodluck =)|`|Vijz0ReOaa	Yes they can come and go. As long as they don't disappear for good. Every pregnancy is different. With my first I had horrible symptoms for the first 13 weeks. This time around I hardly even notice that I'm pregnant.|`|gurR7Dhtaa	YES! YES! YES! I think you are "super pregnant" LOL! This is what my husband kept telling me. Some days I would having morning sickness and vomit all day, some days just here and there. Some days not at all. Some days my boobs hurt so bad they felt like they were going to bust, other days they felt normal. Some days my feet would swell and other days they wouldn't.     Basically some days I would feel as miserable as I ever have and other days I would be the glowing wonderful pregnant women every one thinks you should be.     But my son who is now two, is wonderful. Do you know what your having? A lot of people told me the coming and going of these things were indicators I was having a boy. Good luck|`|yCSIDSmpaa	They're usually around but it's not odd  if it seems they go away. They usually make an appearance when u least expect it.
gurR7Dhtaa	Women who display behavior like this are usually upset over loosing control and are at the end of their rope because they have tried all they can to gain it back, and it hasn't worked. Whatever the situation may be, I think her reasoning for moving in the 1st place was to control the situation. I am positive she feels threatened by your presence, and  with the fact that you now have a child w/ this man (who sounds wonderful, congrats there) she has lost even more control. Without you in the situation I am sure she was able to manipulate your husband more and get away w/ it, even if he knew she was doing it. (Men typically will only put up w/ this when they have a child and it means having contact w/ them.) But to put the icing on the cake the two of you have a child now, and in a women's mind, that makes you much more permanent. She probally feels now like there really isn't much control she has left.     From the sounds of it, I don't think she needs any control, she needs a good psychologist. My first bit of advice would be to talk w/ your husband and find out if shes had a history of drugs or alchol. Secondly I would try to find out if she has a family history of mental problems, maybe bipolar.    As for dealing w/ her...this is a really tough one. Your husbands child w/ her, your husband, yourself, and your own child will NOT benefit from throwing anything in her face. The hardest thing in dealing w/ someone like this is taking a very mellow approach. Always use a calm voice and seem as though you are going along w/ her demands. Have your husband keep a notepad and pen w/ him while he's talking to her and have him write down anything that upsets him WITHOUT commenting on it to her. Have him take a child like approach and act as though he's been scolded. Then the next conversation he has w/ her bring the things up she said that offended or upset him in a VERY AUTHORITAVE TONE. Have him tell her, "Last time we talked you said this and this and this and it pissed me off. I will tolertate you talking to me like this, and especially in front of my son." He can then let her give it to him, which I am almost sure she will, and the best thing is for him to start all over again, write down what she said and bring it up on the next conversation. If he continues to do this she will very quickly (probally 6-7 conversations) come to understand he is smarter than she is and she has lost ALL control. You will then see a diff. women.     This is a person who lives to upset his world. And his world is now your and your child. She knows this and its haunting her. Out smart her and hang in there.     Keep an accurate journal of EVERYTHING that takes place w/ your family and her for the rest of your life. If you ever go to court it will come in handy. Keep me posted. Best of luck!!!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Sounds like my brother's ex wife. What an insane woman! My brother can't really do anything. His hands are tied. All he can do is wait until the kids are old enough to decide they'd rather live with him. (And trust me it's coming!)|`|F6lZHRkVaa	We don't know what it was like when they were together. Don't upset yourself over it.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Just from what you have said she simply does not want your husband around. She thought that if she moved away that your husband would just go away.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	She sounds like one of those people that aren't happy unless she can't have something to ***** about.  I honestly don't know why she would be like that, she just sounds crazy.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	From what you said I don't think she wants YOU in the picture.   My fiance has 2 "baby mommas" and hasn't seen one in 8 years.  and only talks to the other one when he wants to see his son  I'm so glad I don't have to deal with his exes!    Limit contact, she's a poisonous person
fiUqIyVcaa	Nurse Midwives are specially trained in delivering babies that will be born naturally (vaginal birth).  They are not qualified like an OB-GYN doctor to perform a c-section if it should be necessary.    Nurse Midwives offer women the choice to deliver in their own homes under their supervision.  However, if the baby should be breech or if an emergency c-section is required you would have to be transferred to the hospital immediately and an OB-GYN would then take over.    Nurse midwives are an excellent alternative to the traditional setting.  Most of them work closely with OB-GYN's so they have backup if it becomes necessary for a c-section.  Some midwives also delivery in hospitals and birthing centers as well.  I guess the home delivery would be the least expensive.  But if you are pregnant and can not afford insurance, you will qualify for medicaid.|`|npWGkuwnaa	Obstetrician is a doctor a mid-wife is not. I don't know about  costs but presume an obstetrician is more expensive. I would go with the obstetrician myself.
MzlEoOjQaa	I would strongly advise against your son's father signing your daughter's birth certificate! Although it may be an offer made with loving intent, although you did not actually "ask him to", I would guess that your son's father felt the request in every teardrop, heard it in every frustrated question, and saw it in every look of hurt whenever you spoke about your daughter's father. He does not want to see you cry, and probably feels as powerless as you do in the face of the birth father's intransigence.   I mean this answer to be helpful and supportive, but I am also honest and direct in my answers, which is not every body cares for. So, at the risk of seeming insensitive, I think that allowing him to sign than document would not only be a potentially dangerous act it would also be selfish!    Dangerous because the long-term consequences could be very serious. If you do decide to take that particular path, at the very least get some one to advise you on the legal and longer term implications of an illegal act - for your self, your son's father (possibly charged with forgery if it gets known), your daughter's father (what ammunition might it give him in some future battle?), and not least your daughter.    You might hope and believe that this will remain a secret, but this is the age of the internet and Big Brother. Almost anybody can be found nowadays, almost any document can be located, blah blah blah, and it is foolish to let wishful / magical thinking take you forward on a wing and a prayer.    I am not sure what you mean when you say >> my daughter's biological father refuses to sign over his rights so my son's father can sign her birth certificate.   However, I am not sure where you are in the world, and maybe it is permissible where you are. Also, in England, someone can apply for full Parental Rights and take responsibility for a child legally.    Now (if you haven't given up on me), to respond to your specific question about your daughter's father refusing to sign over his rights. Of course, I don't know why, but there are certain clues in your message that trigger intuitive answers in my mind.    I am not sure what you will gain by getting him to sign his rights away.  (even though I am curious, I don't need an answer)    He is a deeply insecure man who feels that the world is against him. He is also probably immature as well, and doesn't take good care of himself  nor accept responsibility for his actions. His parents possibly controlled him all through his life, he resents it, and it is possible that he had some shocking experiences when he was very young, maybe pre- or early teens.     Chances are he wants to live life as an adolescent, at least emotionally.     However, he also doesn't want to relinquish a connection, however tenuous, with the life that he helped create. He may simply not want to give you what you want because of what went on between you in the past  and is almost certainly still going on!    I suspect there is a deep well of loneliness and insecurity in him  and not only him  and a wellspring of rage that lurks very near the surface, and maybe erupts at times.    I may be wrong on every single count, and this may read like so much drivel. Both of you are clearly clinging to something that makes your relationship a battleground. It would be a shame of your daughter, in the years ahead, is a casualty of the war!    go well.  I hope this all works out for all of you and this response helps with damage limitation.|`|SAMRKyZsaa	Well he may of not been a 100% sure of the child being his before.  Now he is but still feels child support is to much and he may want to be apart of the child life now.  also some guys feel just being the bio dad is enough and he is not willing to give that up.     also your son's dad can't sign even if he signs his rights until you are married and he adopts him.   It has already been proven your daughter has  a father the court will not allow that to happen .|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	Sorry I can't really answer this only you baby's father can|`|SnQvsOPwaa	His problem is with you not his daughter. He is holding on to the hope that someday he will have a relationship with her. He just can't seem to get past the problems with you and the child is who ends up hurt from it all.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	It's a part of him that he's unwilling to relinquish.  Selfish, yes.|`|asX2hxFXaa	Tell him the child support stops the day he surrenders his parental rights.|`|AkFag8tNaa	There's no reason for someone's name to be on the birth certificate unless he's the actual parent. It does nothing for your daughter as far as support goes and is a lie like others have suggested.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Because it's a sign of being a complete scumbag. I know it's probably aggravating but I think it's kind of a good thing that he's not fully ready to give up on her. Maybe one day he will grow up and the other dudes name doesn't have to be on her birth certificate to be her daddy|`|0Dbjv10iaa	Because its his daughter. He loves her even though he doesn't show it.|`|Ty6vGEj9aa	Perhaps he doesn't want another man taking care of his daughter. Though he doesn't want her, he doesn't want someone else to have her.|`|26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	When he starts having to pay support every week he will decide to be a father or sign her over.  Either way, he will have to make a big decision and he needs to do it sooner than later.  Maybe talk to his parents.  If they want to be a part of your daughters life, either way, I would let them as long as they are responsible people.  Good luck.|`|jLYTKr33aa	First of all, paternity has already been established for your daughter.  Your son's father can't just sign her birth certificate, as it would be fraud.  We're talking about a human being, not a car with a pink slip.  Taking responsibility for a child's entire life is a pretty serious commitment.  Your son's father would have to go through a formal adoption process in order to become the legal father, but that can't happen if he's your ex.  The only thing you could hypothetically do is marry your son's father and petition for a step parent adoption after a year or so.  Since that's probably not going to happen, you're out of luck.  Perhaps your daughter's father is hoping to be a part of her life later on.  It's selfish, I know, but that may be how he feels.  Only he can answer that question.  Meanwhile, don't stress yourself out over him not signing over his rights.  The judge wouldn't let him sign over his rights unless there were another person - that is, your husband and not just another ex - to take the rights from him.  The chances of you getting your way would be slim to none, even if your daughter's father went along with it.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	Tell him it will mean no more child support from him. That should help. I'm in the same boat. The fater of my 6 and 7 yearl olds hasn't seen them in over 3 years, and he has never paid child support (15k in arrears). He won't sign his rights over either. Good luck!|`|YYLzML9gaa	because hes a selfish idiot|`|QveBSjFSaa	The Father has seen his child. His frequency, or lack thereof, or even the circumstances under which he has seen her, does not mean that he wants nothing to do with her.  Something I don't understand, and it's your quote:     He knows that I would never go after him for child support becuz he is a great father to both my kids even tho we arent together anymore.    Is this to say that if the father pleases you, that you won't go after child support, but if he displeases you, you will?    My guess as to what may be going through his head is that that is his daughter, he pays child support for her, why should he sign his rights over?|`|AA12174100	you cannot force him to give up his rights. Only a judge can. Your present boyfriend or husband cannot just sign the birth certificate. it doesn't work that way. If your ex had his rights terminated then the new guy has to be your husband and you have to do a step parent adoption. Which is alot more than just signing the birth certificate.|`|wZOuSyJeaa	mate if i understand correctly you are asking him to sign over a document that states he isnt the bilogical father of that kid .. that is damn well illegal and a lie ! this might not be important to you now but at some point in the future it will become important for your daughter.  apart from that when she goes to get legal documents or something and she needs her mother and fathers documents it will have the wrong father on there, and she might not be able to get certain papers.     if your son's father does want to take full responsibility for her there are thousands of ways he can do that aside from signing her birth cert to say he is the father.     apart from that you are taking away his right as a father.  maybe he is actually thinking this is important and one day in the future it could and possibly will be.     .. besides why is it so important to have someone elses name on the birth cert? deal with the truth because the lies are just too difficult to deal with. .. and what right do you have to take that away .. ? he may be a ba**ard but he is still her father and his child|`|jUwVUisbaa	because he is trying to make it difficult i am in the same situation..  Im not sure where you live but here in ohio if they have not had contact with the child within one year then they automatically loose their legal rights.       If he wants you to sign off on the child support then why wont he sign up his rights then he wont have to pay. And you wont have to deal with him.    Good Luck!

qXq0nmBzaa	"...she is not foreign or anything just has weird taste! :S"    More than that, she must be extremely young. She hasn't considered that these children will be anything more than "cute" dolls to play with. At some time, they'll grow up and have to face the world with names that will only hinder them.    Those poor, poor babies. She should really put the needs of the children before her own selfish desire to be "creative" or "unique". Perhaps you could show her how to crochet or something to put her creative needs to positive use.|`|0cexaYDeaa	It really are either foreign or fantasy names, I get that she wants her children to have a different maybe uncommon name, but personally, I think those are AWEFUL names.

mO7FOXNYaa	I want to give you some advice.    *I did have help from my family for about 3 years (out of 6).*    When I turned 21 - my family cut me off (I was prepared for it).  I was going to school full time and waiting tables at night.  My sister helped with babysitting. If I did not have my sister, I would have hired a babysitter (which I did do on occasion).     This website is AMAZING! http://www.care.com/  You can find babysitters in your area.     I don't think you would like to wait tables in your condition (!), but what are you currently doing for income? Is there a way to do that job part time? When it comes to scheduling classes - you can schedule classes to better fit a part time work schedule. That is what's awesome about school - YOU PICK YOUR SCHEDULE.    Also, Pell Grant can help with the cost of tuition. Fill out a FAFSA (www.fafsa.ed.gov) - it will help!    The Not So Popular social programs are exactly for these situations.  They are there to help those who are trying to better their lives and become contributing members of society.    Child care assistance can help with daycare.  Food Stamps can defray the cost of food.  Also, there are programs to help with rent and utilities.    I used child care assistance and food stamps (and did not feel guilty one bit b/c I was working and paying taxes!).    I graduated college and landed an amazing job in the field that I studied. I pay even MORE taxes and I believe that if I continue to be law abiding and help my community - I can use that to show my gratitude for the help that I received.    Everything is possible - you just need to know what resources are out there!|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	When I went back to school my oldest child was 3 and my baby was 9  months.  I was lucky enough to have a pretty good paying job, so I could afford to work part time and go to school at the same time.  The only assistance I recieved was daycare assistance.  I would take the kids to daycare at 8am, get to class by 830, get out of class at 11:15, get to work by noon, work until 530, then get the kids by 6.  I would spend my evenings with my boys, then after they went to bed around 8 or 830, I would do my homework.  It wasn't easy, but totally do-able.  Like one poster said, just keep your eye on the goal, and don't get discouraged.  Trust me, it will feel like you are going to school FOREVER before you get done, but in the end it's worth it.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I am not a mother, however I do have good news for you!  MANY colleges have programs for people exactly like you.  I am presently attending a community college, an excellent place for you, and we actually have what was until recently called the "women's resource center," now it is the "transitional center."  It has a daycare center, counselors, and support groups for other single moms, and it's right across the parking lot from the classrooms so you can run over to check on the kids whenever you want.  If this sounds good to you, ask around at schools that interest you and see if they have any similar programs.|`|D3iXIgeNaa	I went back to school and survived on my own. I took care of two children who are now 7, 5 and wasn't all roses but if you keep you eye on the goal you can do it.

su7HU590aa	try taking them to a doctor, to get it checked out|`|zLVZyfwUaa	Sounds like ringworm which is a type of fungus.  My daughter had it and my doctor gave me a topical cream.  Just keep it clean and be prompt with the landry.|`|BAJd8raoaa	I got this one.  I and my daughter (4 yrs.) both have sensitive skin.  Could be she has poison oak or ivy.  I've had it several times and that sounds like it.  And before you say, 'they haven't been outside' or something like that, remember that you can get it just by breathing the spores of the plant in the air, from pets, from other kids.  It stays potent for a year ( I think) after contact with clothes or pets.  Not just touching the plant.  Yes, it's THAT contagious.    One more thing, allergies can develop at ANY time in life, to anything.  I was almost thirty before I started having allergies to pollen and dust.

lhn1wNoeaa	You can take when you missed your period, this gives the accurate result. Or else you can take 5 days before, or else 2 days after implantation bleeding.    If the bleeding occurs after the intercourse(3 days)then the result won't be accurate. Wait for 1 week and take. Hope you can understand it. Lots of baby dust to you.    Best wishes.
WdVjF1Ihaa	I actually love both names, so my suggestion if you are naming your child is to try each name out with your last name, and a middle name you've chosen, and see how they flow.  Emma with 2 syllables usually sounds better with a single syllable middle name, or one with 3 or more syllables, Emily with a single, double, or 4 or more syllables.     BTW, I personally would go with Emma?|`|AA11138222	Of these two, I prefer Emily, but I REALLY like Emelyn.|`|32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	I like Emily better..|`|X4U36dHzaa	emily|`|5sYzlAjPaa	definitely Emma.

Not to 'whack off' too. Yuck.    2. Sex is enjoyable, especially if you love someone. As a young person, you might not understand that.

2irmTjQ3aa	I had no signs at all, everything was normal. I found out I was pregnant only because I missed my period and took a test|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You cannot physically show pregnancy signs a few days after having sex. You have to have implantation occur before your body starts giving you symptoms and that takes a few days past implantation again. Implantation doesn't occur until days 4-16 after ovulation or sex.     You are not having pregnancy symptoms yet hun. Hang in there.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Within the first few days after?  You won't have any.|`|haF1rO2taa	most ppl dont have any signs at all. when i conceived tho by end of that wk i felt like i was due for my period. my boobs hurt, i was gassy, and my face broke out.|`|3yvyEmKOaa	Couple of signs;  -the "pee stick"- use this. might take a bit but check daily. If the test is positive, see a doctor  -morning sickness- if you wake up almost vomiting and it doesn't go away see a doctor (i hope you'd see a doctor for this anyways...)  That's really all i can think of that appear the first few days after conception. As time goes on, more symptoms will occur (breasts swelling, weight gain, loss of bladder control)  Above all, if you think your gonna have a kid, see a doctor. They can check quickly with no risks.|`|70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	I didn't have any signs the first couple of days after. I just took a test after I had missed my period. Later on though I got morning sickness.|`|ULHfJVcJaa	Implantation Bleeding:    Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping.    Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.    Free Medicaid Application Assistance  Delay/Difference in Menstruation:    A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.    Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.  Swollen/Tender Breasts:    Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen.    Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.  Fatigue/Tiredness:    Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception.    Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.  Nausea/Morning Sickness:    This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.    Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.  Backaches:    Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy.    Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.  Headaches:    The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy.    Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.  Frequent Urination:    Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom.    Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.  Darkening of Areolas:    If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker.    Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.  Food Cravings:    While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy.    Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation.
hSB2rP9Waa	I would steer clear of soy products.  They have been proven to have a hormonal effect on humans unless they are fermented (like tempeh or miso).  Also they can make it harder for your body to keep vitamins.|`|g4EnJ5wpaa	First of all, 4oz every 2-3 hours is pretty normal for her age. Also, nutramigen is probably your best bet. My son was extremely fussy, spit up a ton and super gassy too. Even of the nutramigen! I had the same idea as you to try the soy formula, but it did not go well at all! We switched back and gave him gas drops after every feeding. It helped slightly. He eventually just grew out of it. (I tried different formulas as he got older too, because the price of the nutramigen was killing us) but he wasn't able to tolerate anything else until he was 12 months old. Then we switched him to a lactose free/soy free whole milk. And then by 18 months he was on regular whole milk.
Mbuii5A4aa	I have been taking 50 mg for some time now and I have not had any side effects with it.  The first time we tried on Clomid we got pregnant.  The next time we tried it took 2 months.  Usually the first time you take it the doctor will take a blood test to make sure you are on a strong enough dose.|`|hHEMhPZyaa	I did 50 mg in Nov, 100 mg in Dec, and 150mg in Jan. Make sure your dr does progesterone level bloodwork on CD21 to confirm you ovulated. If not you may need a higher dosage. I take it at bedtime with a full glass of water and I don't have any side effects. The first month I did have mild headaches for the first day or two after my pills.  Good luck.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	I took 50mg Clomid before and experienced mood swings, hot flashes, breast tenderness, vaginal dryness, and bad ovarian pain during ovulation. Every woman is different though. I did not get pregnant my first cycle, but good luck. I hope it helps you. :-)|`|6igjX2cnaa	I think I was a crazy example of Clomid 50mg side effects.  I was on Clomid once, and only once, then my RE took me off of it immediately after that one cycle.  I had hotflashes, 3 mature eggs and 3 more trying to rapidly mature (too many), Clomid thinned out my endometrial lining (uterine lining) to 4.5mm by midcycle when it should be between 8-12mm at that time.  I also had dryness from it.  So Clomid was definitely NOT the med for me.  I'm the minority of people though when it comes to over the top side effects. lol!  usually I see people on here who don't get half the problems I had on it.  I actually just did a round of Femara+ Gonal-f+ovidrel trigger shot and JUST got my BFP this morning.  Getting to that point of meds was trial and error.  If Clomid doesn't work for you, your doctor will probably move you on to something else.  Best wishes hun!! I hope it works for you on the first try :) Oh and taking it at bedtime will help you sleep through any slight side effects you get.|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	My frist time was 50mg i just became moody. Also it made my periods go from 5 days to 3 days. Now i am on 100mg an i have a lot more SE. This time i got sick an i could not sleep an i would have night sweats. But its all for a good cause :)     Take it same time before bed. Some women do get pregnant so GL
2UtkBvvvaa	Congratulations! =)  Amber: A beautiful name, I love it. Not too common, but not too 'out-there'.   Rachael: Really like the spelling of this. Name is quite common, but very pretty nevertheless.  Angelina: Gorgeous name for a little girl. Has good options for nicknames: Angel, Angie, Lina.    My personal favourite is Amber; I think that name is pretty much perfect!  But that's just my opinion, good luck with choosing!  Any of those options are great =)|`|mZi7R0Enaa	I think Angelina is perfect .......|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I love Rachael - it is my daughter's name, but i spell it Rachel. Angelina is very pretty also.|`|gu1sEQN8aa	I'm sorry not trying to be rude but I dont like any of them lol.  While Rachel is nice i just never liked it for some reason, Amber is too...crayon color, and Angelina is too much like Jolie.  I do love Angela though.  Sorry not trying to be rude just an opinion.|`|xpUyH0psaa	angelina because it sounds really pretty and is feminine, but there is the constant association with angelina jolie. amber has an image of a girl with red, organe, or blond hair that strikes a resemblance with fire in atitude or looks. rachael gives an image of an innocent girl who is actually really smart and deceptive.|`|nj8o4Rgzaa	amber or rachel|`|ot0TqzSvaa	rachel is pretty good, amber is alright, angelina is horrible.    what about Lena? or Kiyah? or Laurel?    good luck.|`|XoNKECCKaa	Amber and Rachel are pretty. But i think Amber is the best (:    good luck!|`|ZvASEWHPaa	My favorite is Rachel. Such a beautiful name, with a few possible nicknames in there. But Amber has a nice ring to it too, and Angelina is very cute, with a couple of nicknames too. Still, Rachel is my favorite-so beautiful! Great choices!|`|ioGCMeAeaa	Amber--very cute name, its kind of an often used name, kind of not its alright i guess  Rachael--i like this name, nice spelling never seen it spelled that way  Angelina--i guess this name is cute to it just sound kind of old to me(just my opinion)  **very cute names thought out of all of those i think i like Amber the best....hope i helped! and good luck w/ the upcoming baby:)|`|4zvwKkuaaa	I like Rachael the best. It's just to...cute!  But with Angelina, there can be a lot of nicknames.  Nothing against the name Amber, but from experience, many mean girls were named Amber.|`|AMCXVVpEaa	Im sorry to say this but please don't name your kid that! Name it something cute,girly!Heres some names i had thought of!  Ava  Peyton  Asia  Leena  Brooke  Hope  Aleena  Taylor  Amy  Laura  Jacelyn  Jocelyn  Jamian  PHeobe|`|zAlFrR87aa	I love the name Rachel.|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	These are all nice    Amber Rachelle  Rachel Amber  Angelina Rachelle|`|asH6ycbkaa	well i would pick a name that you don't hear to often like Angelina.. i know no Angelina's i know Rachel and Amber's. I would name my girl Elaine or something that you don't to often.
1811aeffefbfc9c757ab5ab4d0eb46e0aa	I gotta go with everyone else on this one.  Tylenol is the only way to go when you're expecting.    Good Luck!|`|z6BtwSE8aa	The only pain reliever that is safe to take during pregnancy is Tylenol. I am TTC and I try not to take anything else, just in case.|`|vj2a6LXMaa	The first 3 months of Pregnancy are the most important because the baby is developing. She should only be taking Tylenol! Nothing else!  As long as she stops taking ibuprofen now, the baby should be fine.|`|qrnAZ2wbaa	those pills can cause a miscarrige... tylenol is only safe|`|h3IjAuCgaa	Well its not advised to take it so i would tell her to stop the first 3 months of the pregnancy are the most important for brain development !  So please tell her to go see her doctor ! Just normal panadol is fine ! And she wuld be 6 weeks pregnant !|`|3gDiRoNwaa	Yes you should ask her to stop because a doctor only recomends pregnant women to take tylenol cuz all other medicines have asprin in them and can hurt the baby yeah tell her to stop and buy her some tylenol.|`|eth48m7Iaa	I heard tylenol is better. ask the dr.|`|Mbuii5A4aa	I would ask a doctor, but usually they tell you not to take ibuprofen while pregnant and only take tylenol.
2irmTjQ3aa	Both are equally safe. Why would one be safer?|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    Both but with boyfriend is safer as they can be there in case of anything.  God bless x and dont need extra time in case you need to go to the hospital or anything|`|kaqPSgTVaa	there are plenty of pregnant women that live alone. why would one be safer over the other? do what you want.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Unless your boyfriend is abusing you it is just as safe living alone as it is living with him.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Guess it really depends on where you live and where he lives. Weigh the pros and cons of living together and go from there!!|`|AOfm8ey6aa	Sorry, but this is a silly question. Of course it is safer not to live alone. My husband lives temporarily out of state and I am due with our 2nd baby in few weeks. I am scarred thinking what will happen when I go into labor all by myself with a little toddler in the apartment. I have some friends who could take me, but they live several miles away. Not having health insurance (not looking forward calling 911) and knowing my previous labor was lightning-speed fast, yeah I am scarred. Do not be alone if you have a choice. Also, if your boyfriend is not a nice guy and you think about leaving him, it is definitely better to be alone than being with someone who abuses you etc. I do not know your situation, just guessing.|`|816TYl4eaa	well i think you should stay with your dad since you already ask a question like this.    well sorry you didnt like my answer but your 17 and need a stable home for a baby.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	it would be better to have someone else around|`|ULHfJVcJaa	um well be with a family cuz they can take you to the hospitle if anything happens|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Near the end of the pregnancy it would be best to have someone around, in case you go into labour.  Other than that, it's probably the same either way.|`|L7uz5Xmzaa	In this case, living with someone(bf or whoever.) because if something happens they can drive you to the hospital, in most (99% of cases) if something goes wrong, they want someone else to drive you to the hospital, they never recommend that you drive yourself.|`|Eqln1jmNaa	honestly if you and your boyfriend dont live together already, or havent experienced the life of living with him, i would most deff say to live on your own...   this is a major step in a relationship and you dont want to risk it just because you got pregnant... sooo let it be for a while, get support from him but dont make the commitment until you know that this is a step you want to take, no just because you found out that you're pregnant|`|NuLfMnBaaa	if no one prohibits you to go with your boyfriend, why not?  it's safer to be with him than being alone unless you have your family who are there beside you.|`|zmbeIbx7aa	I think that it is safe to live alone or with your boyfriend, family, friend etc. I think it is with whatever you are comfortable with. Some people like the quiet and to have their own space but others feel safer with someone else around. When I was younger I always lived alone but for the last going on seven years I have lived with my boyfriend/ now husband. I couldn't imagine living alone now. I guess I have gotten use to having someone most of the time. I think that it would be better to stay with him during the last couple weeks so that if you go into labor it would be easier to get you to the hospital faster. Whatever you decide I don't think there is a right or a wrong answer to your question. The answer is based on what you are most comfortable with.|`|8UYWHSZBaa	if he does not be rude or mean or abuse you its safer to be with someone and your husband or boyfriend they can give you comfort congratz|`|AA10852282	MOVING IN WITH A FAMILY IS SAFER,. YOU SHOULD NEVER SHACK UP WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND!!    GOOD LUCK!!
TflNnrjkaa	she is beautiful *no homo intended**  : D  i hate it when relly pretty girls think they r ugly  she is very pretty|`|jgtfWjE4aa	YOU'RE decent looking|`|IZJSuShbaa	beautiful smile! she's cute|`|d67ULZQ6aa	She is a very cute girl, she should have no problem at all getting a boyfriend at all. Now, I'm not going to lie, she isn't sexy or anything, but she's defiantly not ugly what so ever. She's very cute. If any guys breaks up with her because of the way she looks then they are just stupid, because she is very pretty.|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	UGLY!|`|OGLulBtwaa	spare her the "no, but you really are pretty" speech  just take her to see the movie He's Just Not That Into You, you both can laugh at it and talk about it after. she is pretty, but beauty's only skin deep!|`|n3h9Byhpaa	Awwwh, she's gorgeous!|`|a0n9QXUraa	She is not an ugly girl at all.  =]  ya cute.|`|GngaBPjwaa	she is very pretty!!!|`|2djVdpnKaa	She's really pretty! Definitely nowhere near ugly!|`|lZU0XzfTaa	she looks like mexican man wish greesy beaner hair.|`|ZAcfOrNbaa	Hahaha. "She's ugly. Sorry hunny".. don't listen to that girl. She sounds fake and stuck up and is probably nasty. But to answer your question. The girl is very pretty.|`|hOkmcVeDaa	I think she is very pretty. She is just meeting alot of jerks, guys can be so mean.|`|l1STgPyRaa	I think that she is a very nice looking girl maybe it is a issue with the people that she is trying to date and the problem is not her as fare as i can see she is a nice looker|`|qOe0WX1laa	shes really pretty   like model material    honestly all those guys have been bitches   she deserves better|`|nzyOCsOiaa	She's actually really pretty!!  Tell her I love her hair!|`|1s3nddaYaa	i think she is pretty. i really like the black and white one.it reminded me of the women that used to sing in the 50's i love that. if that has happened a lot, its just one step closer to the man she is supposed to be with. take that as good not bad. tell her that :)|`|v05RzzCEaa	shes as cute as a banana.....  i have no idea if that is good or bad.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	She's cute.  She shouldn't have a problem getting a bf.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	She is very pretty! I don't think she is ugly at all.|`|EccBqsntaa	She's pretty!|`|R0YkIVlpaa	she is really pretty i love her smile :)|`|WH23a4qXaa	shes ugly, sorrry hunny. Im sure shes really nice though
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Older...    Sex young is irresponsible. You have to think of the consequences. And being young, you have no experience in life or relationship matters, so you can't make real decisions if the person really cares about you.     I think the youngest acceptable age is 16. Anything younger is so disgusting. ??|`|WIpeC3gRaa	After marriage, but that's just my religion kicking in.|`|o0Q7LmMsaa	when the person feels ready and knows the posibilities of what can happen if they do do that  i personally think when they are older   but everyone has their own opinions  and there aren't any right ages  it all depends|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I think they are ready when they know how to be safe and know the consequences and are emotionally ready and mature enough.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Older.  17+ is good.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	The best age to have sex is when you are ready to take care of a baby, as long as it is over the age of 18 because under 18 is underage and people under 18 are not going to be able to take care of a baby without someones help.  You need to be financially stable to take care of a baby.  No form of contraceptive except abstinence is 100% effective at preventing pregnancy, and there are way too many girls getting pregnant when they aren't ready because they decided that it was ok to have sex.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	If the options are younger age or older age...then older age.  I wish I had waited a few more years before I had sex for the first time.  But it depends on the individual person, and their maturity level.|`|EccBqsntaa	18+|`|ihA9ydaLaa	when your ready for STD's|`|cDVAEHgCaa	In your late 20's|`|vj2a6LXMaa	I would say older. Or if you honestly think you have found the one. Maybe 17+. I met my husband at 16 and we have been together for alittle over 6 years. We didn't have sex right away either, we waited a few months. I think that's best! Good Luck|`|d67ULZQ6aa	There is no right answer for this question honestly. Most people will say older, but it all depends on if someone is ready. I think if you are ready, and know what could happen then I think its ok to do it at whever age. So like I said this questions has no real "correct" answer, but I guess it's just when you feel ready.|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	When you are prepared. You can do it when you are 12 or when you are 69. Just bring a condom or make sure she is on birth control. You only need to be 18 if you expect a baby. Otherwise, do it with the one you love.|`|ldN2AL1zaa	younger age. As young as 13 years old or 12 years old. Early experience early mastery.|`|2djVdpnKaa	Older age, when there is more maturity. If you have sex at a younger age, you're more likely to end up with messy relationships later on, and I've seen this happen.|`|sMuMfuAgaa	I do agree that it's best whenever the person is ready but I also think that it should be when the person's older because when you are older you are much more responsible and know more of what you want as compared to your teenage years.|`|HJ0Ujd4Oaa	after you get married. or after you have been in a long steady relationship or even after you fully understand the consequences of it and know how to be safe|`|ZAcfOrNbaa	Don't take advice for anyone about this. It's your body and you know when you are ready. Just whenever it feels right. I was 13 and i WASN'T ready. I let the guy pressure me into it, and i've been doing it ever since. I'm 17 now and i enjoy it more with the guy that i am with now. I don't care what people have to say about it, it's not something for them to know anyways. I'm responsible and protected and stick with one partner. I'm a religious Christian as well, and i was waiting until marraige. But the unexpected happened and i gave into a man. Ever since then it just doesn't fase me all that much anymore.|`|l1STgPyRaa	i think that the older you are  the better... but then again some just do not seem to be able to deal with that idea for many reason but i think if you are older your more able to handle it then if your younger     Good luck|`|87Dne23saa	whenever you feel mature enuff to handle that kind of situation, and the consequences it cud bring. i know that i am not ready for that kind of commitment, and might not be for a few more years. only when you feel 100% certain your ready for this.|`|vXGL4maiaa	after your marry|`|YJi8CZnNaa	Above 18.|`|OaRR9qoSaa	I don't believe their is a certain age, but it's more about when the person is ready and if they are ready to accept any consequences that comes with sex.|`|EBkGtGjDaa	i say older so you brain is close to working a 100% ( age 18 and up)    also     MOST IMPORTANT read THIS and TALK BEFORE sex:    1. what protection would do you plan to use?    2. do you know that protection is not a 100% and can fail? BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING!    3. would you make you partner use protection?     4. what would you do if someone got pregnant or you got an std?    5. you do know it only takes once to get pregnant or get std?    here is a list to make sure ready:    1. when BOTH 100% ready mentally, physically, and emotionally    2, your NOT doing it to prove anything, or to keep someone.    3.you know all the myths about sex, you know all the facts about sex, you know about all the protect how effective they are and what would be best for you.    4. you know all the pros and con and will to take the responsibility for what could happen.    5. you keep learning about sex: http://plannedparenthood.org and http://sexinfo101.com    e-mail me if you have any questions    I'm 19 a virgin ( god damn proud of it) with my bf (virgin too) dating for 11 months and no sex
J6vd8Gsbaa	Take a test my mother had her regular period up until she was 5 months pregnant. I had mine regularly for the 1st month then irregular for 2 more months. It happens sometimes|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    you need to test darling or blood test at doctors is best.    you have had breakthrough bleeding its good that you had no pains or clots. yes you might be.  God Bless x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If your period was normal to heavy flow you aren't pregnant and it was a period. It doesn't matter how long the period is. Not every time will you get clots either. Of course you can always test...|`|cj7sSPZEaa	The only way for you to know if you are pregnant or not is to take a test.|`|97JwSvUzaa	Well, if you got pregnant back when you missed your period, it would show up on a test at this point. Your best bet is to get a home pregnancy test.  It is totally possible that you are pregnant because light bleeding is fairly common in early pregnancy, so that could be what you had the second month (rather than it actually being your period).    Good luck!|`|dcNmRPGPaa	sometimes pregnancy symptoms and on coming period symptoms are very similar. try taking a test. that's your best bet.|`|Vijz0ReOaa	If it was very light, it could have been implantation bleeding which usually occurs around 10 days after ovulation. Definitely pick up a test next time you're out. Sometimes your period can be delayed due to stress. Travelling will sometimes cause it as well. It has happened to me.
pzLDXL6gaa	Newer information is showing most antibiotics don't affect bc but there is evidence that some can affect how it works in a small percentage of women. So I guess it depends how safe you want to get - some doctors tell people they don't need to use back-up contraception but most doctors and pharmacists say it just to be safe. Can't you just nip out and get some condoms? Oh yeah and if he doesn't finish your chances are less likely. I've known people who did pull-out on the pill and antibiotics and were fine - pulling out doesn't usually work though. Make sure he urinates first as well.    Harriet|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	Pretty possible sense you start getting use to the pill after a long time of using it and since antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of the pill|`|d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	I got pregnant while taking the pill completely religiously and all that changed was the fact that I was on tylenol for pain when I broke my wrist! I never took the pill late even one time, so you might want to think about waiting a couple of weeks to have sex if you're 100% certain that you're not ready for a baby just yet. Either that or get some condoms fast!|`|dFWPyMONaa	Well the best way is not to. You are going to run the risk because of the antibiotics affect on the birth control. Now with him not finishing that is something that can not always be controlled..even pre *** has sperm in it....maybe you guys should just have a fun night of foreplay... That would be my best advice for you|`|X7G1kjMfaa	since you guys are not ready to have kids and are in the mood to make love in the mean tym try giving eachother an oral or a hand job maybe you'll both might love it but surely he will....hope my idea will help...lol
L7uz5Xmzaa	You can eat peanuts too! I ate them every freaking day when preg(helped with the morning sickness) So you can eat any kind of nut you want!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    yes you can, As long as you arent allergic to them its fine.    god bles  x Go and Enjoy    i cant live with out my peanut butter|`|JgpyfuuWaa	If you have a family history of peanut allergies, some doctors recommend you stay away from peanuts.  However cashew nuts have not been identified as a potential problem.|`|PVGoUSnqaa	Its up to you, I never ate anything like that since they say all nuts can cause allergies to develop.  But its up to you, some doctors disagree about the whole peanut thing altogether. However Id rather be safe than sorry|`|AA10852282	WITH THIS PEANUT EPIDIMIC GOING AROUND I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO EAT ANYTHING WITH PEANUT BUTTER IN IT!    GOOD LUCK!!

Congrats btw ;D    a girl name I like is Amelie Jaine|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	Justin is nice but I don't like Skyler.  Skyler always seems feminine to me.  Justin Tyler would be nice.  I really don't like Lane Tuff at all-It's just too weird.|`|9a2MdcuSaa	nice|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	Megan Marie and Justin Skyler are so cute!!  Lane Tuff...not so great.|`|xpUyH0psaa	megan marie sounds really pretty.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	I like Justin Skyler.  Megan Marie is very cute too.  Lane Tuff isnt great.    my suggestions for boys: Xavier Nash, Jett Rylan, Chace Tyler.  for girls i also like Ava Marie.
AA11724307	I understand where you are coming from.  I've been trying for 2.5 years with no luck and trust me...it doesnt get any easier.  Most doctors wont do much for you unless you've been trying for a year though so keep at it.  you can try seeing your doctor, but I dont know how much help that will be.  As for losing his job...,y dad lost his job right when my brother was born.  these things happen and he has always told me if you wait until you can afford a child then your never going to have kids.  If you got pregnant today then you still have 9 months before this baby is born.  I'm sure your husband can find a job in 9 months.  I would just keep at it and see what happens.  good luck!|`|hHEMhPZyaa	Lack of income is not a great setting to bring on a baby. After 8 or 9 months, I would go to the OB and start asking questions. BC might be an option, since some women are more fertile right after coming off bc pills.|`|b9DhpqhUaa	Well hun first off if he lost his job a baby is not a good idea right now. You need to have alot of money saved up and need to be financially stable to be ready for a baby. They take more than just love and care, they take lots of money. Wait until he finds a descent job then try again. You may not be timing it right. You can buy tests kind of like a pregnancy test that tells you when is the best time for you to get pregnant. If that doesnt work then see your OBGYN. You may be infertile. Its very common. They can put you on drugs and get you going, or there are other options but worry about the money thing first.|`|f96dbdfb33ecfe1ebea6423d5d7fc870aa	I'm going to say this, please know that no one on here knows exactly how you're feeling and what we say we say because it is how we see your situation and it may not be what is right for you, though we state that's what we would do in your situation- ok?    I would like to say that you have been trying for a long time. Yes, the stress of job loss is a horrible thing when you're trying to conceive, and can actually make it more difficult for you to have a baby. Money is a big factor, but in most pregnancies, a lot of the time money has not been saved up and people do what they have to do to make ends meet.     I suggest NOT going back on BC pills, as they will mess with your ovulation etc and it will throw your body into a loop. You do not know when your husband will gain new employment, it could be a short time, or a long time. I would try other forms, that don't mess with your body's hormonal cycle. IE: condoms, spermicide, etc.    My best wishes go out to you during this stressful time.|`|2HJgbPBvaa	I agree with everyone else above me but also wanted to add that when you're carrying a baby they react to your stress, and it sounds like you have so much of it right now. Wait till everything evens back out for you, then see a doc.     And best of luck to you! You sound like a concerned parent already and i'm sure everything will work out perfectly.
PFO1jxZGaa	No. My middle one was 10.15 and he skipped the whole newborn size and went to 3 mos straight away.   Also no new born diapers fit him or even size one. He started at size two and stayed in it only about 2 mos.   Its good to have some in new born size though in case he is a little smaller, just leave the tags on just in case they wont fit.   The ultrasounds are lot of times a little off , a pound each way. I was told my last one was 9.10 and she was born 9.1  two days later.   Congrats on your big baby though! Its funny now we look at his newborn pics and he is as big as a 3 mos old :)|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	They grow out of them so quickly even when they are small babies.  I had more 3-6 month clothes for all of my children because they grew so fast!|`|FNaCuPyIaa	babies grow out of clothes so quickly . you would be wise to buy more bigger sizes of clothes..|`|Ms8b2kISaa	My son was only 8 pounds when he was born and he still needed more 3-6 month sizes than he did 0-3....so I think you made a good decision. I have so many newborn things people gave me that I never got to use!|`|kxUigIkraa	Hey,  Just wanted to say that what they say after the ultrasound in terms of the baby's size is always a guess. I had a friend who was told her baby would be tiny and it was huge, and vice versa. Just to set your mind at ease a little. Six sleepers sounds like plenty. I had two. And my baby was 6 pounds at birth. At the one month checkup he was 13 pounds. They grow very fast, especially in that first 6 months.|`|klniepcFaa	i think given your other babies were pretty big, it should be ok... however, i just had my 1st baby(so i know its not exactly the same) but my dr kept telling me my son was going to be big even after an ultrasound and induced me a day after my due date because"he was so big" and he was only 7 lb 2 oz, so they could be wrong
h3IjAuCgaa	Its not impossible that's for sure ! But i mean i didn't have symptoms like that until about 2 months b4 i conceived so every month i thought i might have been pregnant ! But anyways I took a HPT 2 days b4 my period was due and it wasn't a sensitive test i got a BFP even though it was light i took 8 over the next few days each got darker ! so give it a few days at least buy a sensitive test to get the best results !  Good luck Hun !|`|1811aeffefbfc9c757ab5ab4d0eb46e0aa	It's definately possible, wait a couple days and test again!    Good Luck & Baby Dust!|`|lhn1wNoeaa	yes you have a high chances of pregnant. Just wait for 2 days and take a test. Hope this should be your month. Lots of baby dust to you.|`|5ORyLk4Uaa	it is possible just wait until your missed period and test good luck|`|6zkKEeGCaa	yeah it might be possible.. it was weird i slept alot for no apparent reason.. and well just the thought of food at times made me gag.. i took three hpt a week after i had missed my period and they all came bk negative.. but i guess i just knew something felt diff.. two wks after my missed period i went to the doctor and sure enough they confirmed it.. best of luck to you..|`|3gDiRoNwaa	You could be pregnant but the best time to take pregnancy test is about a week after your missed period or go to your doctor and they can take a blood test and tell if your pregnant now.GOOD LUCK!!
rMTIBjfGaa	That sounds really creepy...only because of the ending. Otherwise this should be a good thing, but its creepy. Talk to someone and make it a movie or something XDD|`|vf5gLYEaaa	better question  what do you think it means|`|wuGBoTzeaa	I also had almost the exact same dream. (I'm 19 and don't plan on children yet either) I was the mall standing outside a realty place, holding "my child" on my hip and slightly bouncing her around. She was so vivid and real.. She had almost strawberry blonde hair (mine's brown) and bright blue eyes. She was very pale but had the rosiest cheeks. We were both dressed warmly, so I assume she was cold. Also, the last thing I remembered was giving her a kiss on the cheek and her smiling at me. I woke up and immediately felt sad that I didn't have her around and probably wont for a while. I haven't been able to get her image out of my mind!         Just thought it was weird you had the exact same experience!|`|de57b70b7b8b3aec7587cbe4c90b6ff1aa	hey, im 19 and i have been having dreams about my unborn babies since i was like 13. i also want to wait, it is ALWAYS boy twins with blonde hair and blue eyes, i have brown hair and brown eyes. the're names change tho, it used to be jai and kai. yes, its good because i always wake up happy :D the music in your is wierd tho.
zk3Bp9uNaa	Sounds strange they are giving you an ultrasound for that.    My fundal height always measures a few weeks ahead (i am 28weeks now, and my fundal height is 31weeks)    My baby has always been low - she engaged around 20weeks(very early)    Nothing to worry about|`|3g1y1Ahhaa	i think that its nothing to worry about. some women carry high and some carry very low, and you just happenned to be a lowe carrier. so dont worry im sure that eveything is fine.|`|TIbmRFLQaa	I think your baby's just sitting low right now.. I always mearsured 2 weeks smaller with both of my kids, i'm sure everything is fine.|`|916b9f2e50839abb51e314ab19c8258eaa	Every woman's body is different and affects how they carry a baby. The location of the placenta may also play a role in how the baby sits.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I wonder why they gave you a sonogram for that? My baby has been very low my whole pregnancy. She even droped at 31 weeks. However my funal height has always measured 1 to 2 cm ahead. I have never had any concern over that....
AA10852282	GO TO THE SOCIAL SERVICE OFFICE SO THAT YOU CAN GET ON SECTION 8, OR GO TO A CHURCH THAT HAS AN OUT REACH PROGRAM FOR SINGLE PREGNANT MOTHERS.    GOOD LUCK!!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	theres a form of housing called "maternity home" it's where girls pregnant after 3 months and girls up to 6-months-post-partem can stay with their babies.|`|FEzmVmFjaa	Maybe try craigslist.. There's a place under housing called "Housing Wanted" and I have posted things there cus my husband and I had to find a new place when i was about 8 months pregnant, and I got alot of really nice emails from people willing to help.  Or maybe search around online, google or something, looking for Shelters for pregnant women in her area or something along those lines.  Good Luck.  There are people out there who are willing to help, especially a young pregnant women seeking help. If she lived in Hawaii I would help =)|`|qrnAZ2wbaa	go to an homeless shelter....|`|JsaEk8UAaa	has she tried a homeless shelter - they have something long term or a shelter for battered women, half way house of some sorts - you didn't mention why she is homeless so it is hard to suggest anything|`|haF1rO2taa	im sorry to hear you have to go thru this alone, i knw what its like as i was alone when i had 1st. churches are a good place to look for help even if you do nt attend. also social services can get you temp housing usually in a motel or something. you can get all types of help being a single preg women. they just need id,income info and a few other things. keep your head up. fyi you can also get free medical for you and baby, ask about that too. good luck.|`|3gDiRoNwaa	You can help her by finding a shelter or finding some of her relatives to stay with or you could be an angel and let her stay with you GOD would really bless you for it times are hard and i feel like if your in the position to help her then do it cuz times are only going to get harder and you dnt no who you will ever have to lean on for help.So i hope this helps and i wissh her and you the best of luck.|`|sIxdlaxqaa	she can either go back home w/ her family or find local friends and c if they can help her. tell her not 2 give up hope. God will help her.
OZ3XmVDWaa	Honestly deppends on the girl. 96% of the time the girl will provide for her own saftey. The other 4% are crack whores who want money. And as for the B/C  most girls (who can afford it) are on it, Afterall a baby ruins buisness for awhile (unless the guy is into prego chicks o.0)|`|eOUQ07mJaa	i'm pretty sure either party that doesn't want to contract some sort of STD would insist on using a condom...there are tons of condoms to choose from anyways...|`|vf5gLYEaaa	yeah sure you not a prostitue|`|puCOYwMmaa	She does.  Any quality sex worker (like not some addict selling her body for drug money or something) insists on condoms and supplies them.  Stds and pregnancy are not good for business.    I don't think she can sue, its consensual and every knows sex can get you pregnant.|`|wd7z6B1Oaa	I think prostitutes normally carry condoms in case the man doesnt have one. The pill does not protect against STD... it just prevents you from getting pregnant.    Just because a prostitute sleeps with you doesnt mean she wants to take the risk of STDs.
plRSVw4laa	I truly doubt she can sue him because he was in the act of prostitution and that would be very hard to win a settlement.     As far as the condom, it depends. Sometimes the guys have them, but most times the prost. have them in their purse or with them. Some prostitutes are known to be on the pill just in case.|`|kKACyAM8aa	There is an interesting show on HBO about different kinds of prostitutes. The prostitutes basically always carry the condoms for obvious reasons. There is a difference between higher class call girls and the street hookers. The street hookers are probably more likely to not use condoms, however street hookers mostly perform oral sex because they perform in a car.|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	They should both have condoms. She should be caring about her body (although I guess she doesn't cuz she's a hooker). He should try to protect himself knowing she's been with a million different people. Not all hookers have pimps and if she was smart she'd be on birth control. Don't think she can sue since what she's doing is illegal.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Well not to be funny but I'm watching Pretty Woman at this very moment. She (Julia Roberts) was the one who supplied condoms. If a prostitute gets pregnant she is just SOL anyway because prostitution is illegal. As far as getting on any type of birth control I am not sure about that. Hope this might have helped!|`|r39EDGhPaa	The prostitute should.    If I were a guy and I got a prostitute knocked up, I'd head for the hills.|`|kGVPOZ3faa	Are you stupid? You can't sue for being impregnated. Wow. Dumb-***.
G2auAv1Saa	Put her on the floor and see if she goes.|`|8tagIO3aaa	do you have carpet if not lay a blanket down and put baby on it and surround baby with toys and step back and watch you will be amazed at what baby will/can  do :-) it is a joy being a mom :D keep your camera handy!
OY98G3HOaa	Okay, yes they have places where you can send in DNA and get it tested that way. You need no one's permission because they are sent in as Sample A, Sample B etc. A regular DNA test done throught the court is different (I had one done). They swab the child, the mother, and the potential father. All three samples are tested (They need the mothers sample to verify, there have been cases where women have brought in a different child so the father wouldnt think the child was theirs). Also, the grandfathers DNA would match the child it would just be a different kind of match but they can tell.    There are way too many variables here for this to be correct.  A- there was no sample from the mother.  B-No one has seen any paperwork here...  C-(a little out there)- maybe the grandfather is not the father's father. (you got that right)?  Where did he "go" to get it done? If it was through the court or similar it was illegal and he isnt being honest...    Good luck to your friend.|`|AA12123428	Taking a sample without the mother's consent would be assault and he could be charged with assault on a minor.|`|fCZKGBjBaa	If the grandfather used his DNA then of course its gunna show up not his child's cause IT'S NOT. you would have to use the father's DNA, and the baby's. I would say the grandad is lying to get her out. But why don't the mother, father and baby go in to the doctors to get it done.|`|6mcmeAe1aa	Yes, and it would match too. Of course, the 'Dad' might be protecting his son from the baby, so he doesn't ruin his life... how old are they again?|`|AA10857340	So the grandfather is not related per the DNA? That has nothing to do with the father being related to the child.  If I were the mother I would get a court order to prove the child is the fathers.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	First off i would ask your friend to find out where the test was done and what the results were, as the mother she has the right to know. Second have the dad or prospective dad tested and let the answer come from a medical facility not a relative, the grandpa may not want to be a grandpa and it could have all been made up. Have the baby's mom stand up for her son and she could always have the testing done herself. Some states and countries allow dna testing to be done for security purposes and to protect the child so check the local laws. If there is doubt have the parents take the child to be tested themselves if grandpa lied he will fall from his sons good graces. But if the dad wants to be apart of the childs life he shouldn't object to being tested, if he does there may be a underlying issue. Does your friend want that kind of man for the father of her child or herself.|`|AA11024148	 1 the mother must consent for DNA testing.   2 who's to say that the grandfather is or isn't the natural father of the baby's daddy?   3 who did the test without the consent of both 'parents' involved?   4 now that the grandfather wants to be involved mom can legally make him pay for a REAL test to be done. insurance will not pay for it - neither will medicaid. it's around $900. hope he has the money to pay for it now that he opened that can of worms.|`|AA11631715	no, can test his own, but not the child's, without parental consent.  But if it's done, then it's done, and the facts speak for themselves.
ptert8E6aa	thanks for scaring me for life|`|0plFo5A1aa	when he comes, it goes in you. even with your butt on a pillow, all that will happen is it will pile the come by your cervix. your cervix isn't opened ready to swallow a bunch of fluids. the sperm know what to do. they are the ones that swim around in search of an egg. you don't really need to put your butt up on a pillow. as long as he had his penis fully implanted, you will have good chances. then when your done laying down and you stand up, the come runs out. also, just because it runs out after you lay down or if you stand up right away after sex, it does not mean that there are no sperm inside of you. they live around 2 days inside your vagina. so, you dont need to pile them up against your cervix. just let him come, and then clean up the mess. you will eventually get pregnant. 80% of couples have troubles conceiving (words from my doctor). so take your time, and dont let your butt be a slave to that pillow.|`|rmse6Mj8aa	the idea of propping up your lower back/butt is to help the sperm to swim up through your cervix, which they do naturally.    the stuff that comes out after the half an hour lie down (not an hour honey just 20 mins - 30 mins!) is the seminal fluid that the sperms swim in. it's like their transport and it will seep out when you stand up after sex.  some women find they feel wetter than usual for 24 hours after sex as this semen will come out. this is normal. dont worry!    you should  lie down to help the sperm to swim for 20 mins after sex and while lots of women get pregnant without doing this, it does help the little guys to have gravity on their side.    80% of couples do not have trouble conceiving. most people take up to a year to conceive their first child and of those that take longer, some may have minor fertility problems that can usually be very successfully assisted!    dont worry hon really - just get familiar with your cycles- learn when you ovulate and have sex on the days leading up to ovulation and the 2 days after it.  good luck
oj1TszL2aa	I know exactly how you feel - to the extent that I could have almost written it myself. My fiance and I are both 20, nearly 21, and also had a "surprise" pregnancy a year and a half ago that we lost. He graduates university in June, I still have another year and a half to go on my current course and then I plan to go into teaching, so I will need another year of training on top of that before I am qualified. Most of my friends and people I grew up with didn't go to university and are having babies now, which kind of makes things worse - and even though I know that if I wait to have children my prospects in life will be so much better than theirs, I still end up feeling jealous of them.     I know that everyone else seems to be answering this saying that you should talk to your fiance and start trying for a baby now if that's what you want to do. All I can say is that you should discuss things with him either way. If you wait until you have both finished studying, you will be able to offer your child a lot more, and financially things will be a lot easier on you both, meaning less stress and worry. Would it be possible for you to effectively compromise on the situation? You say you finish college in June - would you be able to wait until you've finished there, work for maybe a few months and then start trying? That way your fiance will still be at university whilst you're pregnant, but the baby would be due shortly after he graduates?     Ultimately, you and your fiance are individuals, and only you can decide what is right for you. Talk to him, explain how you're feeling if he doesn't already know. One thing is for certain, you certainly aren't stupid, and you certainly aren't alone.     Good luck with whatever you decide.  Hope this helps.  x|`|4DoXomHZaa	Don't put your own selfishness and impatience before the needs of your future baby. Life isn't fair.    Let him finish school, get a house, get yourself completely independent, GET MARRIED, then have the baby. 21 is too young.    Teen mommies make it work because they depend on the grandparents and the government. Is that what you want?   Shuffling the kid to one babysitter after another so you two can trty to finish school...which chances are you wouldn't...going down to  get your WIC and foodstamps?  Your fiance has the right idea and a lot of maturity. Listen to him.|`|nvsVXlBlaa	If you want a baby talk to your man. I am 22 and have 2 kids, it's not always easy but they are the joys of my life. You can still go to school and work, just take the baby to a good daycare facility.It might be hard at first but in the end it's all worth it.|`|nbmpSkmsaa	Dont Be scared if i was you i would tell ur fiance dat u want a baby now!.|`|111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	The good thing is your only 21. You have plenty of time to have babies. Your fiancee is probably wanting to get school out of the way. I would talk to him and tell him how badly you want a baby. Things will fall into place. Take your time and don't stress about it. Stress can actually prevent a pregnancy. Your going to make a great mom when the time is right.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	Teen moms make it work, but that doesn't mean they don't make sacrifices. In order to take care of the child most have to drop out of school. You need to finish your schooling first. Child care is so expensive. I had my son at 19 and ended up droping out of college a month after having him because we couldnt make things work out that we had a sitter and daycare was just too expensive. He's wonderful don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want it any other way now. But it's def. hard and things as they are now would def. change.|`|AA12115728	I'm impressed that you have taken many steps to prepare yourself and practice for parenthood!!!!    But...    A cute, cuddly baby is fun, but a screaming, needy child that you can afford to raise is more lovable than a screaming needy child whom you can't afford.    Wait as long as you can. The rewards will be many.  Rather than "finding a way to make it work,"  you will be much happier in the long run if you know that you have the time, decent jobs, and money to raise a child.      The economy is not so great right now, either - people are losing jobs left and right.  Why don't you spend this time earning the highest level of childcare training?  You could use this while you are raising your own child, being a daycare mom.  People will ALWAYS need daycare, and you will be contributing to the family's finances while your husband is working outside the home.|`|cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	Take to heart all of the answers above about the financial aspect of having a child. And I know that even though you KNOW these things, it doesn't make the feeling go away. You can know every ugly and gory detail of having a child and of being pregnant, but it still doesn't make it go away. Nothing will.     Waiting to have a child until you're both financially ready to have one will make it that much sweeter. You'll be able to enjoy being pregnant and then enjoy the birth so much more without worrying so much over whether or not you can afford it. Not to mention, waiting so long to have a child - when he/she finally does come - imagine the tremendous excitement!     Now, here's something that might help you. As much as you want a baby, you should focus on your relationship right now. Focus on making your relationship as strong as you possibly can before your baby comes that way you know without a shadow of a doubt that you'll be able to give your child the very best family that it deserves. By focusing on your relationship and making it strong, you're doing this not only for yourself but for your future children.     So many people rush into having children, or are not careful enough and are surprised, and then their relationships fall apart. Be thankful that you have the time to work on getting your relationship solid and getting your career set in motion that way you can provide the very best you can for your future children. Think of it this way, every thing that you are doing in your life right now is for those future children when they come.     Also, focus on spending time with your man. Make the best out of it and enjoy those mornings that you can sleep in or just play in bed all morning. Make use of the ability to just pack up and go whenever the urge strikes you and enjoy that while you can because even though you'll never regret having your children - when they come you won't be able to do those things.     So while you're waiting to have your precious babies, enjoy the time you have being childless. It will still be hard and that pull and jealousy will still be there until you have your own, but I hope I've given you some new ways to think about it - to get your mind off it at times.     And no you're not stupid, and no you're not the only one who feels this way. :)|`|mTdU6XZMaa	being a teen mom is not easy !  i do it day by day and go to school.i sleep a few hours a night.  i do everything by myself apart from half the day i have a nanny for my son,and i dont work bcoz my parents were really understanding (after a while) and they support me financially.  luckily i am one of the ones who had a lot of luck,as my parents work bcoz they like it.  they own three beautiful boutiques,and the money flows in as they sleep,which seems amazing.  but  a baby is tiering..    finish college,get a place to live(proper and safe) ...and then try for a baby.   Speak to ur bf about it,and see what he thinks...  and remember that marriage is not everything..some ppl say u should have a baby afterwards...but i dont think it matters as long as u love each other and ur honest :)|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Maybe you could volunteer at your local middle school.  That might help.  Middleschoolers are the nastiest, little people on the planet sometimes and being around them as opposed to cute little babies may enlighten you about what you're in for after you do have a baby.  It'll also prime you for when the time is right and you can have you own.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Just be patient and wait until you are both finished school.  It is only 1.5 years.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	i feel the same way as you and i am the same age as you and funny enough my boyfriend is the same age as yours. we have been wanting babies for a long time now but we cannot afford it yet im in college and we aren't even married. i started working at a school and now i know that i am not ready for a baby. i know babies are super cute and stuff but they are also loud, they don't let you sleep, they take all of your time, and they are expensive|`|OQdPzl15aa	I think it's normal at certain stages of life to want a baby...but trust me.  Waiting a couple years will do you good, because people changed dramatically in their early 20's.  If you need a baby fix to hold you over, I suggest getting a nanny job. (That put my baby cravings to rest!)    All the baby stuff is nice, cute and cuddly....but there is so much more to it than that.  Suddenly, you can't just go out anymore, because you are tied to your baby.  No more sleeping in for a few years, no running off with your girlfriends whenever, no more staying out late, your body changes forever......also, they are expensive!!!  Having a hospital birth alone costs $3000.    Wait until you are both a little more stable financially and finished with school.
723QHuicaa	Alcohol is an anaesthetic, putting it on gums would make them gums feel numb.    Its not recommended thesedays for obvious reasons, best to get a good teething gel and icy cool teethers.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Apparently my mother did this to me when I was an infant (in the 70's.) to numb my gums.  Not sure if it worked, but as an adult, I do enjoy a nice bourbon.|`|IVjspiStaa	no...no....noo....|`|707gOCvbaa	Their tiny mouths are more sensitive. Use anbesol  gel for babies. You can find it at any drug store.|`|A89ezcg5aa	It is a numbing agent.  If you gargle with Listerene you get the same effect.  I personally don't reccomend the alcohol method.  Just use Baby Orajel, Baby Ambesol, or a cool teething ring.  Some people say Orajel makes the gums tougher, but my kids teeth always came in easily.|`|1Si9RlEXaa	I think the alcohol take the sensitivity away a pit. I don't think it would work that well unless baby drank a lot, which I would never recommend, or any amount for that matter. It's an old way of doing things, lots of grandparents swear by it, they also tell me to give my baby rice cereal at 3 week, stop breast feeding formula is better, and let her cry-it-out so her lungs can develop.  Times sure have changed.     Their are the all natural baby tablets you can try. They are called Hyland and available at most stores. I use them on my baby and they work pretty well, on really bad nights I use a very tiny amount of baby Orajel.   Hope this helps, teething sure is a long process for some babies, well at least mine. :)|`|j4w4mzS0aa	it numbs the babies gums I would not give your child any kind or any amount of alcohol|`|VXQFT341aa	Yes it works.|`|z74wSbQoaa	Alcohol dulls the senses.  In a little baby it wouldn't take much to give an effect.  Really there is no reason to try this method in this day and age.  There are many other products out there designed for this specific purpose.  I'd try Teething Tablets by Hyland.|`|D3iXIgeNaa	I had about that to but never tried. Try using baby Tylenol and also try teething rings. The gels always irritate my children|`|o2YHnKXiaa	My boyfriend also believe in doing this but it isn't advised anymore so we stuck to baby orajel and teething rings because teething can last months before a tooth starts to appear.|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	Before we had oragel and other teething aids, people did rub whiskey on the gums of infants that were teething.    They also gave whiskey to gunshot victims as a painkiller too - you've seen that in all the westerns, right? If you're drunk enough, it won't hurt...    I'd be more likely to use some clove oil that's been diluted on the gums before I used whiskey, simply because alcohol and babies don't mix - their systems aren't matured enough to handle it.|`|dFo0k3zDaa	alcohol is very dangerous to your baby, instead try baby orajel and tylenol... if that doesn't help, talk to your dr. they might have more suggestions, but it is very dangerous to give a baby any amount of alcohol... i wish it was something we mom's could try but it just isn't|`|8tagIO3aaa	if your baby is having trouble teething talk to you Dr.  yeah i heard of dipping the passy into whiskey and rubbing it on their gums it only works for a little while  you do not want your baby to Develop the taste for the whiskey and grow up drinking some do i have read the studies best of luck to you i hope you find the answer you are looking for  but i think you should talk to you Dr. first|`|DvJJu8Dwaa	For one...  Someone killed a baby like that.  I heard if you use salt it will help ALOT.  Did for me.
6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	Mostly 2% milk, but also get some (very) watered down fruit n' veggie drink.  Also tap water.  Why tap water? Our family doctor told us that, while they're not to have fluoride in their toothpaste because the concentration is too high, that city tap water contains just the right amount.      Never soft drinks or juice that ends in "ade" OR "cocktail" ... those are all loaded with sugar.      Don't let your kids get their calories from drinks.      Check it out; a 16 ounce bottle of Sunny D has 260 Calories and 60 grams of sugar!!!!! That's equivalent to 8 eggo Chocco flip flop waffles.

We do celebrate "chocolate milk monday" where they get that with dinner.    They'll also get juice on weekend breakfasts.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	My daughter drinks mostly milk with a little diluted juice, jugged water, or some V8 smoothing mixed with milk. She drinks no pop whatsoever.|`|a8lsETxHaa	Mine love Crystal Light, strawberry-kiwi and orange-pineapple. I'll also let them have a cup with snacks, etc on the weekends.

My four year old has one sippy cup of oj and then a other filled with water. She sometimes has more water before bed. My two year old has about the same thing but he likes grape or apple juice.|`|99735a22fbfaab5561850052bda71db5aa	Juice is okay (remember it has a lot of sugar too), but really water and milk (whole or 2%) are the best.  Never give young children soda/cola/pop (whatever you call it).  It rots teeth and conditions their taste preferences to sweet stuff, making it harder to get them to eat foods that are nutritional for them.    Our boys (I have 4) drink a lot of water, milk in the morning and sometimes in the evening, and sometimes a cup of apple juice (not every day).  I will admit we will occasionally give the older boys a Sprite at dinner very infrequently, but they only get one cup and have to drink water after it's gone.  People underestimate how something as seemingly benign as this can have such a huge impact on your children.  I see 5 year-olds drinking entire cans/bottles of regular cola and it just breaks my heart, because their parents are setting them up for a life of battling their weight.  These taste preferences lead to a lifetime of bad dietary decisions and augment the steady escalation of childhood obesity trends in this country.|`|446edbddd6db88aacfc6cef13d8f3aebaa	usually my 4 year old gets milk and water but at breakfast he loves a little apple juice, i do allow him to have fizzy peach water but only a couple of times a week and he NEVER gets soft drinks such as cola    my 9 month old mostly still has his milk but he does like the baby juice you get but i dilute it further
f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Welcome to the world of 'Being a Parent'.    They all do this at some point and what he is doing is trying (and winning) to assert his authority over you by not going to sleep unless you are there with him.    Stop it now or you will have more and more trouble in the future.    Don't back down to him - set the rules - cuddle - good night. Then leave - he'll get the message after a couple of days that you will not come running every time he whimpers.    Make sure he is not hungry or thirsty before bed and let him get on with it....don't keep backing down and pampering him.    Never mind what the goody goody brigade say on here - like, love him and bless him he's lonely or needs comfort - you will end up paying the price if you back down to him all the time.|`|IdReJpTjaa	my child does the same when she was younger perfect routine now she dont go to sleep till 2am|`|Irdj2KAFaa	I agree 100% with jamand.     We basically did exactly what he stated. My wife and I follow a routine that our son looks forward to. In fact, there are times when our son asks if he can go nigh-night because he is too tired to stay awake.     Everyone's routine is different; simply try a few different tricks, eventually you'll find one that works for you.|`|h6YdTiyUaa	First of all, stop sleeping with him, that will be a very hard habit to break and you and your husband are going to really be regretting it as your intimate life will suffer.    He will cry maybe for a few nights, but stay strong and keep putting him back in his bed. Super Nanny is really good at enforcing this...maybe you could watch some episodes on ABC.com to see how it's done.|`|rISHTfK3aa	You need to get a new routine and stick to it know matter how tired you are. This routine needs to be kept even if you have visitors as the least wee thing will upset your son so you need to keep to it. The problem you are going to have is that your son will not like this change as he is so used to you doing what you are doing now but if you are firm with him, he will get used to it. Don't give up.
O8zOZzO6aa	Okay Chelsea, what problems do you expect? You have deleted the pics in your phone; your friend has done the same (did you make sure??).    Well, there's nothing to worry now. Except this, be a good girl and DO NOT REPEAT this. You may not be lucky the next time!!
ETFZaJkmaa	Young lady, u be in big trouble if your picture will  fall to a wrong hand. Be careful. Dont trust anyone although he is your boyfriend.  You will never knw hw long you will be with him.|`|H2IqzG12aa	If he really deleted the pictures without ever sending them to anyone else, and you did, too, then your safe.    Your age isn't that important (except for the overzealous, anal retentive prosecutors wanting to press felony charges for such behavior).  Even adults are finding themselves in trouble or embarrassed by photos they allowed to be take in indiscreet circumstances which then fell into the public domain.  Let this be a lesson that you'll never forget:  Don't get drunk.  You're lucky the pictures were the only consequence.|`|FlSCb3dxaa	No, it's not biggie...  NO phone bill will show the pictures you sent.. it may tell how many you sent, but it will not show the pictures, lol.. I have Verizon and my mom has Alltel.    Just learn from your mistakes.  You send it to the wrong person and they can post them up on myspace or something for everyone in your school to see.. Luckily, you sent them to someone who you could trust..    I did worse stuff than that when i was 15-17...

Are you sure he delted the pics? Maybe he didn't. I don't know too many teen boys who wouldn't lie about it and show it to God and everybody.    Don't get drunk anymore and you won't do stupid stuff you regret later that could ruin your life or get you into jail.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	if he deleted them then you have nothing to worry about.  But i would make sure and go through his phone.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Apart from the bill, you don't need to be worried.    Until, One of you turns 18.  If that is done between the time of your 18th and your boyfiend's 18th birthday, whichever is 18 first, could be charged as a pedophile because of the sending of nude pictures to an adult.|`|eba7fefdf839622869be8b19d9b9ca2baa	On the bill it doesn't show what pictures ya'll sent.  But if your parents pay a good amount of money that could see what you sent.  But... Just don't mention it.  Make sure it is deleted.  Don't be  worried.|`|mzFUWq8iaa	the phone bill doesnt show what pictures you sent, so dont be worried. as long as you deleted them just tell your parents, if they ask, one of your friends got snap happy with your phone thinking it was theirs.|`|5F224cRzaa	Lol we all do stupid stuff when drunk....|`|cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	If you're positive that he deleted the pictures and you trust that he didn't send them to anyone else.

(Not like I never did it, haha.)|`|4kM6ei3haa	nothing to worry about it. as long as your boyfriend really did erase and didn't send them to anyone, or purpose or accident. Same for you. you cannot see what pictures were sent by looking at phone bill. they do not show on the bill.  no worries.|`|rwUJNJ6saa	It's okay hun, as long as you trust your bf enough that he deleted it  and don't worry about what others say about how drinking is wrong and blah blah...they've all did it|`|H6LxeWZfaa	as far as your parents finding out, dont worry about that.  because no matter what theres no way they can see the picture itself or a text itself from the bills.    the only thing to worry about is your boyfriend showing your picture to someone else!  hope he doesnt! lol.
jaP0TANdaa	Sounds like side effects from Depo to me. I was on Depo for 8 years with my last injection in March 2008 and my body's still not quite right. My nipples and breasts are constantly sore, especially after I ovulate (during my luteal phase). It takes a while for your body to get used to all the hormones again after being tricked with fake chemical hormones for so long. Good luck to you and hopefully the Depo will wear off all the way soon enough!|`|UFu0h8SKaa	never used it, but sounds a bit early for being pregnant. whenever i stop taking pill it takes ages to get it out of my system and get pregnant, but everyones different!
688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	My son has a milk protein allergy too.  I can give you a list of things to try, but to be honest, my son won't drink any of them and I have tried them all.    Personally, I think Almond milk is the best alternative.  It has the best texture and taste.  I've also tried soy milk, rice milk, and all the chocolate and vanilla flavored varieties as well.    My son refuses to drink any of them.  I've even tried "letting" him sip from "my" cup so he'd think he's getting something of mine.  That didn't work either.    And contrary to what the doctor said, he did NOT give in and drink it when I tried to offer him only the milk all day.  She said eventually he'd get thirsty enough and drink it... he didn't.    And I tried the half formula half milk trick too.... no deal.    So after months of trying, I gave up on milk alternatives.  It's just too expensive to keep throwing it away.  And I can't cram it down his throat.      If your concern is the Vitamin D and Calcium, as mine was, look to juices that contain them.   You can find it in Orange Juice  and now V8 has some fruit juice blends that contain it and so does juicy juice.  I look for the ones that contain fruit and veggies.  It may not be as desirable on "the list" as milk alternatives, but it's better than nothing.    So, if you are sure that your daughter is not at risk of having a nut allergy, try the almond milk...  You'll probably just have to experiment.  Start out with the smallest containers so you don't waste as much if she won't drink it.   And be willing to drink some too.  (It's not that bad really.  But it is different)    If it's not succesful that way, try the drink boxes.   I know the soy milk comes in drinnk boxes..  (Once you open the cartons, you have to use it in 7-10 days.)    Also, you can supplement with vitamins.  They have calcium gummies that my son was able to take when he was one.  And then a regular gummy vitamin.  If she's not familiar with gummies, then just remind her to chew the first few times until she gets used to it.    For protein, our doc told us peanut butter was a great source (Thank God JIF is not part of the Salmonella recall!).  And since he's allergic to eggs as well, that's not an option for us.  We also were able to confirm that he does not have any peanut or tree nut allergies.    So far, our son is thriving.  His checkups are always great, he's gaining weight, he's very strong, he's growing like a weed and very very bright.    So the absence of milk has not caused him any harm so far.  I just look for the missing nutrients in other sources.|`|dSmoB64Yaa	Enfamil AR (anti regurgitation) is not a cow's milk protein. It's soy based, with a rice based thickener. Some other Soy based formulas include:  Enfamil, ProSobee, Similac, Isomil, and Nestle Good Start Supreme Soy.    I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Here is some information from the Univesity of California, San Francisco, Childrens Hospital.    When is my child ready to be weaned from the bottle?  Children can try a cup at 6 months and be weaned off the bottle around 12 to 18 months. Children are ready to be weaned when they:    Can sit up by themselves   Can eat from a spoon   Show more interest in solid foods   Have an established routine for mealtimes     Why is it important to wean my child off the bottle?  Children using bottles are more likely to develop tooth decay.   Children who drink from a bottle may have improper dental development.   Children who depend on bottle feedings may not consume enough solid foods to meet their nutrient needs.   Children who are not weaned from the bottle may not develop appropriate feeding skills.     How do I wean my child off the bottle?  Introduce the cup early at age 3 to 6 months. Let the child hold and become used to the cup without liquid.    At age 8 to 10 months, substitute a sippy cup for a bottle at one feeding during the day. Use this same feeding time to use the cup every day for a week.  Every week, introduce the cup at another feeding, slowly decreasing the number of bottles the child receives. and feed very slowly.    Consistency is key to successful weaning. Be sure to give the child the cup at the designated feeding time and don't switch back to the bottle at this feeding.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	If she can't drink milk, you can replace the necessary FAT in her diet with other healthy sources. Do not use SOY!!! Bad for little ones. Almond or Rice milk are all good alternatives, but really, she doesn't "need" any of them as it is the FAT she needs from the milk and those (as well as water and juice) do not have enough fat to replace it, so make sure you are supplementing her fat intake until age two so her little brain can develop properly.|`|xbbEbvxnaa	Call your local Health Dept. Nurse, she may have some options.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I would have thought the Dr. who tested for the allergy would have given you a list of replacement items.|`|vue9NOhYaa	A child who is allergic to milk can't have any real milk products.  So you could use any of the fake milks -- soy or rice or almond.  Or just skip the 'white milk-like beverages' entirely and offer other beverages: water, juices, etc.|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	What about Enfamil AR. Its for acid reflux. Does that have milk protein? If it does, then go to soy milk. All of my kids had to drink it because they were lactose intolerant.
vue9NOhYaa	He knows what he needs. He's taking in about 20 ounces a day, which isn't too bad for a baby this age. His weight gain (about 600 grams/1 pound a month) is also considered about the minimum acceptable gain.    If he's happy and healthy and eating what he wants, then trust that he's taking what he wants, and gaining as HE is supposed to gain. If he's not meeting his milestones, or seems unhappy or in pain, you'd want to speak to the doctor. He might have reflux or some other health issue.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	you should NEVER force a baby to eat. if your baby drink 3 ounces 8 times a day then it would make 24 ounces which is fine. if baby is having enough wet diapers it sounds fine|`|8tagIO3aaa	call or take your baby to the Dr. it might be the formula have to switch it  ask you Dr. before you  make any changes. you only want what is best for your little one :-)|`|Xosu35K7aa	you shouldnt make your baby drink more.  doctors tell you you HAVE too feed them but thats not true your baby will eat when its hungry.    a baby shouldnt be woken from sleep just too fit the pattern of eating every 4 hours.   older people eat when they want , so a baby should have the same right! :] he will eat when hes hungry. dont stress about it too much its YOUR baby no one elses    i hope that helps  x!  congrats on the baby!|`|D3iXIgeNaa	I wouldn't stress about that, if you doctor says that his weight is fine then he is good, babies will not starve to death as long as you feed them when they are hungry. Soon enough he you hopefully wont have this problem|`|723QHuicaa	speak to your paed or health visitor. If they are happy with his weight gain and growth on his percentile - then there is nothing to worry about.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If he's gaining weight, has many pee diapers a day and the doctor doesn't think there's a problem, there isn't a problem.    Don't force the baby to drink more.  His stomach is very small, if there's no room in there, there's no room.  You can try offering food to him more often, in smaller quantities, but most of the time, babies know best.|`|zTiaGyuMaa	Talk to your child's Doctor he or she only knows the best for your baby.|`|YENiEvoJaa	Forcing him to drink more? That's not right! Feed the baby as much as he wants every three hours, PERIOD. That's all he needs. Mine only drinks two to three ounces at a time as well, she's 16 weeks and somehow her weight stays on the same percentile every time we go to the doctors.
dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	That's a tough one.  I think just hang in there.  If the baby is keeping you awake he is keeping the mother awake too.  It won't last forever.  I don't think it would be wise to confront a sleep deprived, stressed out  new mother. She is well aware that the baby is causing a disturbance at night,  Be a good neighbor, go have a visit with her, she would appreciate the company,  offer to watch the baby while she takes a shower, or a nap. Tell her, in a kind way, that you are aware that she must be tired because you can hear the baby up at night.  That will make your point.  This is a tough time for her. A little kindness will go a long way.  Who knows you might make a new friend? Hang in there, it wont be long before the baby sleeps through the night.     OR    Buy some earplugs.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	You can say something, but it will be rude, and there won't be much they can do about it. I'm sure when the baby cries they are trying their best to calm him down.

Let me tell you there are people out there wouldn't think twice about reporting it anonymously to the authorities, but diplomacy, "heard the little one crying is every thing OK". as previously suggested. If nothing else it makes them aware its affecting other people.Best of luck|`|SBjV8GlFaa	You must have really thin walls in that condo! I don't think you should say anything, as they aren't doing it on purpose! They aren't getting any sleep either, so just get some of those ear plugs from the chemist, and maybe if you see the neighbors, you could ask how their new baby is, and maybe they will ask you if the crying is bothering you.|`|8tagIO3aaa	try sleeping to music as you fall asleep or use earplugs that is if you do not want to say anything   most people might take offense to it and say to mind your own Business but be gentle when approaching the subject. ask how the baby is doin and how is gets through the night and take it from there the mother might be having trouble bonding with the child or it might have colic or something   i wish you the best of luck! hope you are able to get a good nights sleep  and your neighbors baby too|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, it's tough.  The parents don't want the baby to scream any more than you do.  If they had a magic trick to make him scream less, trust me, they'd use it.    You can say something, but I'm not sure they can do anything to solve the problem.  Babies go through phases.  It'll pass.|`|vpL67nETaa	If the baby is keeping you up, remember, it's keeping the PARENTS up too.  I'm sure they're a lot more stressed out than you are.  If they could make him stop crying, they would      It's a baby. Babies cry.|`|A89ezcg5aa	There's not much you can do about it.  Little babies usually cry whether you soothe them or not.  When my kds were newborns, they'd stay up until 4:30 am, sometimes screaming the whole time.  They're probably going crazy just like you are.  It's just a part of apartment/condo life.  Maybe you could get some noise muffling earphones, or an iPod?|`|7bTOY5vHaa	I understand that you don't want to hear the baby, but you should think about those things before you move into somewhere when you can hear everything your neighbors do. I don't understand what you are wanting them to do? Its not like they can make the baby stop, if they could Im sure they would have done that by now.  You are just going to have to live with it.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	You COULD say somthing, but there is not much they can do to fix the problem. Babies cry and thats all there is to it.  Saying something will probably just tick them off|`|pqZAhBLvaa	I think the next time you run into them, ask how the baby is doing, because you've neen hearing him wake up all night. Make it sound like you are concerned. Maybe just by them knowing you can hear everything, they'll try to curb it a bit. There's not much else you can do. Babies cry. I have 3, and I do my best to keep my little one happy, but hey, it happens.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	It's something your going to have to deal with, Babies wake up at night if you don't like it than move out. But saying something will offend them.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Not much they can do about a crying baby, they are not trying to wake you up. If you have a problem with it, instead of asking them to keep the baby quiet, walk up to them and ask them if their baby is okay, because you heard the baby crying the night before and was concerned. Something along those line, then they might ask if you could really hear it and then take it from there. Conversation might not go well though.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	You can but you will not accomplish anything. I am sure that they don't like hearing the baby cry either and are trying everything to help the baby calm down. Get earplugs or a sound machine to help you sleep.|`|YENiEvoJaa	You can say something, but it won't help it will only hurt. It could really hurt- make things awkward, etc. You'll have to move or hope that the baby will start sleeping soon. It probably will.

AA12112190	It very well could be but honestly all that you really can do is wait and see.... Good Luck and God Bless!!!!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	the blood test is the best solution.    implantation bleeding is usually 6-12 days past ovulation. this is late for that now.  having said that, it is very common for women to bleed around the time of their missed period when pregnant. spotting is also common.    blue line pregnancy test are not good to buy as they frequently get evaporation lines.   if you read the test outside the 10 minute reaction time then you can not consider the + as a true positive. the urine begins to evaporate and can often create a faint line over the positive antibody strip on a preg test.  test again with a pink line test or a digi test with her first morning urine.  best bet is to wait for blood results though.    good luck|`|kH56qw2Taa	sounds like good news x|`|Dv1turONaa	if there was a positive line there however faint it means it is a positive test, the stick has to detect the pregnancy hormone in the body to give a positive reading so whereas u can have a false negative you cant have a false positive, the brown spotting i wouldnt worry about, it doesnt sound like implantation bleeding is too late for that but as long as its not pink or red it should be ok, all the best and congratulations

"i look about 6 months" shes so tight fitted in there, its hard for her to move at all.. she will give me a few good kicks everyday. Just give the baby time :)      36 weeks and 4 days, with a GIRL!|`|dx7QSbkVaa	the baby sleeps more as you move around just lay down for a while and wait when you are not moving the baby wakes up and is usually most active at night when you are sleeping    My son was like that i never ONCE felt a movement or a kick|`|otFCWMuUaa	your only 17 weeks.. be patient.. around week 20 you'll start to feel more steady movements.. the doctors dont even make you start countin your fetal movement till 28 weeks..     i was impatient too but dont get upset about it. its just a tiny little thing still. at 20 weeks my baby only weighed 10 oz.    i wish you the best of luck      ps i found that soda doesnt work as well as orange juice does..   but sometimes the baby will sleep right through both..|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Yeah, when I first started feeling him move I would go a few days before I felt anything again, I would get so scared. I had the exact same concern, I didn't feel pregnant anymore and I couldn't wait to go to the doctor to hear the heartbeat. It may be a little soon but try drinking fruit juice and lay down on you left side see if you can feel him.    Don't put too much emphasis on your measurements, some women may measure a week or two off.    Congratulations!|`|AA11471252	It sounds like you are so active, you don't have time to feel anything but tired. All that motion will rock the baby to sleep!     The person who suggested drinking soda was on the right track. If you drink something ice cold and rest for a few minutes, the baby will surely move due to the icy drink you just pored on his rump!|`|1EwbKkKCaa	Quit walking so much, I felt the same way and my doctor said to drink some soda and lie flat on my back and the baby would move almost every time. And it is normal for your due date to move after an ultrasound. Mine did like four times.
9973c6e02e14ba355b22d50b1410ec1baa	I don't suppose it's cheeky as such, but I personally would never ask for money for a gift for any occasion.  Friends of ours are getting married and have asked for money instead of wedding presents, for their honeymoon!  I just find the theory of paying for someone to go on holiday a little bit hard to swallow somehow.    If there really isn't anything you want/need for your baby's birthday, why not consider asking people to make a small donation to a charity of your choice, maybe the NSPCC or another children's charity?
T8ksKCWCaa	I only use the advanced method.|`|rmse6Mj8aa	do you use opk's or just temp?  if opks override it to only use opk to detect o then it cant get it wrong.|`|Jef1GPTaaa	I only use OPK.  My RE recommended OvuSponse for me, and it worked.  Good luck.
stUzx5VVaa	It's an IV.  It's definitely not a shunt - the shunts they put in babies do not look like that.  Typically in an infant they use a subgaleal shunt, which looks just like a little bump under their skin and drains from the head to just under the skin in the head.  If they are big enough, they'll put a regular shunt in, that goes to the abdomen.  If they can't do either, they'll take a needle and drain the fluid manually every day (or more frequently)    It's not a heart rate monitor, those are not taped on, and we don't put those on the head.    But that's definitely an IV.  It's a weird looking one (the yellow part) but I can see a normal hub in the back of it.  Sometimes the veins in babies are terrible, especially if they are jaundiced like this one is, and the head veins are usually great, even when all the other ones are blowing.|`|723QHuicaa	I have heard of people being cannulated through veins in the head, it could possibly be that.    During labour my daughter had a heartrate monitor attached to her head as the belts were not picking her up, possibly something to do with that?|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	There could be water swelling around the skull, my little brother had a lot of swelling and tubes like that.|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	Might have been born with water on the brain - the tube is there to drain it away.    http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art....|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	a drip sometimes babies veins are to small to get anywhere else in the body so they put them in the head or neck x|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	it is either a shunt to let fluid out or it is an IV because the baby's veins in her/his arms were to small to be used|`|8uiH6iRbaa	it could have been put in place to get an accurate pulse reading !|`|gTWgbpNFaa	poor little mite. you had better ask at the hospital you will be scared stiff if you believe any thing on here|`|aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	It looks like it could possibly be a shunt to drain fluid off of the baby's brain.    Then too, it could be a monitor of some sort.  Babies are so little that they sometimes run out of places to put the monitoring cords.    Sure looks like a healthy little one though...    ***********************    Thanks Neonates - glad to know what it is!|`|MeYILJeSaa	It could be a heart monitor. They put one on my son's head when he was still inside...|`|thCmn0noaa	It's a shunt, in cases of hydrocephalus, a one-way valve is used to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain and carry it to other parts of the body. This valve usually sits outside the skull|`|mlT1ZrZtaa	it is probely for draining water or fro a scan of the brain hop it helps  x
6XFnwAlLaa	u cant get her pregant with a condom .|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	No, gravity doesn't have anything to do with it. Your sperm have tails that make them "swim". and if the condom breaks just pray you didn't get her pregnant.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Using a condom greatly reduces the risk of pregnancy.  Sexual position doesn't matter. (You still need to pull out as soon as you ejaculate. The condom won't 'leak' as long as you're still hard.)|`|jeztbF6naa	it doesn't matter what position.  its weather the condom will break. and most of the time they don't|`|21Lnhdfeaa	If you are having sex (even if she is on bc and you are using condoms) there is always a chance of getting her pregnant.  There is less of a chance of getting her pregnant if you wear a condom, but there is always a chance.  I'd say it's unlikely that if you're wearing a condom properly and she is on top that she is going to get pregnant.  Not unheard of, but not very likely.|`|NI8D46J0aa	It will probably not flow out, but any time you have s ex, you can get pregnant. The only birth control that is 100% is abstinence.  (I know, I sound like a s ex ed teacher, but it's true.)|`|eS9nPWqBaa	hehehe|`|9vgZNLP8aa	You can get pregnant with a condom in ANY position. They are not 100% guaranteed to prevent a baby. If you are that paranoid about getting a girl pregnant than maybe you shouldn't be having sex.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	No matter what position you have intercourse in, she can still get pregnant.  Condoms greatly reduce the risk as long as they are used correctly, but if you are still worried she can use a back-up method.
IGfnrfGPaa	I was advised by her Pediatrician to only bathe her every 2-3 days. Their skin is very sensitive and there is no need to bathe a newborn daily, let alone 3 times a day.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i usually bathe my son and at night, and i still do. one bath a day is fine. your baby is only 2 weeks, doesn't get that dirty lol. but if it soothes him when he is cranky i say you can do that.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	It is your baby so listen to you only not your mom or anyone else. If you bathe a baby to much their skin will dry out. There is no need for that. If he/she gets a little messy wipe him/her up with a wet wipe. Simple don't bathe your baby 3 times a day. I gave both my kids baths 1-2 times a week at that age. They are so sensitive. I would go for bed time when you do bathe him/her because it is calming|`|kxUigIkraa	Oh my gosh. They are all wrong. Don't kill yourself. It's hard enough to feed him and change him all day long at that age. Babies don't really even need baths other than like once or twice a week. When they are old enough to have fun in the bath, with the back supporting thing, then you can put him in once a day for his benefit. And even then, it is recommended only to use soap once a week. Babies have very sensitive skin. Too much water will dry it out and make them get all scaly and rashy.|`|FmC1TGm5aa	No way! That's way too many! You'll dry out his skin. I've always given mine 2 baths per week. Her pediatrician advised no more than twice a week. Once a day will damage his delicate skin!|`|iCLGHUdQaa	I really don't think you should bathe an infant that often - definitely not 3 times a day.  I think once every other day is sufficient - unless they have a blowout or something, that is understandable.  Infant's skin is extremely sensitive, and depending on what part of the country you are in it's probably really dry right now.  You don't want your baby's skin to start peeling and flaking off!    As far as time of day, that is up to you.  If the bath calms them, I say do it before bedtime.  If they hate it and it riles them up, then before bed is not such a great idea.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	I started bathing my daughter in the baby tub when she was about two weeks old and do it every other night. I got her into the bathtime-pajama-bottle-bed routine and she caught on quickly. Its good to have a "schedule" in my opinion. I'm not saying to schedule every minute of the day....that's near impossible...but especially at bedtime it will help with her sleeping habits. My daughter will be 4 months old tomorrow and has been sleeping all night since about 9-10 weeks. She goes to bed around 930-10pm and wakes up at 730-8am with an exception every once in a while.    Bathing them too often can make their skin really dry, especially if you have kids like mine who were plagued with eczema. My son, who is now 6, had to be washed with Dove when he was an infant. My daughter has patches of eczema so I make sure I don't wash her too often or it will get irritated.     When babies are 2 weeks old they can't get THAT dirty. Using a wet washcloth or even those pre-soaped wipes at Wal-Mart that you rinse with water do a fine job for the off-days.    Relatives like to tell you how to do your job as a mother when you already know what you're doing...it's their "duty" lol. Bathing a child at any age 3 times a day is rediculous. I know some people who do it daily but no more than that.     Morning baths aren't bad but night time baths right before bed really help to soothe them to sleep. Do what you've been doing and ignore everyone else.|`|KHOsfLM9aa	Is your baby, you choose.  I got my baby use to a bath in the morning and one at night, but that's just me.|`|a485e8f533a15dc3cc9e66f068f78342aa	Newborns really dont need more than a few baths a week because their skin is so sensative.  I like baths at night because it helps them relax and sleep better.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	Oh my...when they're that little they don't even need ONE bath a day! I bathed my son 2-3 times a WEEK! When I did, I did it at night, before his bedtime to relax him some more.|`|FNaCuPyIaa	a new born baby doesn't need bathed any more than every other day at the most...their skin is very easily dried out by the soap and water. it's up to you when to bathe ur baby, it can be a good night time routine when he's older or a nice good morning...its up to you you're the mom! my baby takes a bath e/o day ..|`|R0EsQapRaa	Oh gosh no, he only needs 1 bath (at most) a day.  Not even that.  I always bathed my baby in the evenings.  You don't want to dry out his delicate skin.|`|7PNbjit0aa	Onece every couple of days is more than enough for his age.  3 baths a day will strip his skin of natural oils and cause him problems.  It's up to you when but I find a warm bath before bed relaxes baby and sets up a good routine.|`|MthIvBZ3aa	when you read in books and ask around, many will tell you about every 2 days is fine!  i mean think about it: your newborn isn't do much activity or out and about that much for them to have to get a bath every day and especially not twice a day.  now if you prefer you can give your baby a spong bath every day, but it doesn't need to be vigorous each time.  just a nice wipe down and that's it.  even if you just wipe him down with a wipe every day and every other day give him an actual sponge bath with soap that's good too! it's really up to you as a parent but most recommend every couple of days. hope this helps! best wishes...|`|E047GSKdaa	One bath a day is MORE than enough.  Try to make a bedtime routine of it so you will have an easier time of putting baby to bed later.    Newborn's skin is very fragile.  They do not get dirty, do not sweat, so they really only need a bath a couple or 3 times a week.    Bathing daily will exasperate problems like eczema and dry skin.|`|26SV6lWTaa	I would not bath a 2 week old newborn that often. I think every couple days will be perfectly fine. Their skin is extremely sensitive and will dry out with bathing them often. When you do bathe them I would bath at night to calm and relax the baby for bedtime.|`|jTJNOUMwaa	You only have to bathe him 2 or 3 times a week. Too many bathes will dry out his skin! Babies that young don't really get dirty. Once he starts to crawl and get into things then you should bathe him every night before bed to get the day off of him and to relax him for the night.  When you do bathe him make sure you use some baby lotion and lotion him all over so he doesn't get dry, and make sure you rinse the shampoo out really well to help prevent cradle cap.
xMy0QEvFaa	It could be implantation bleeding.  Yes, you could still get your period when your pregnant. but it's rare.  Get a pregnancy test or go to your local clinic and get a blood test done, they're more accurate.|`|zSABr7praa	Take. A. Test.

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	The less you interfere, the more she'll do because she knows you trust her (too much) and that she can get away with it. She's 9 - her personal life should involve you and not be 'private.' Yes, she is entitled to privacy, but not in the sense that it's letting her get away with things right under your nose.     Just because she's 9 doesn't mean she can't engage in things like smoking, drinking and drug use, and probably sex, too. I knew someone who started drinking around that age and was an alcoholic by the time he was in his early teens. Look at Drew Barrymore's sad existence as a child. It happens. You need to address it now, before it's too late.|`|1s3nddaYaa	umm. i dont think a 9 year old has much of a personal life. or should have a cell. i think its the way the parents raide there kids that make them mature faster. having a cell at 9??? thats odd.. not saying how you parent her is wrong but she doesn't need that much freedom at 9 or a cell phone. that will just cause issues down the road and will prolly have sex early.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Really, your 9 year old has a cell phone?    That's why things are happening so early. Parents help push it along.|`|gILygKvRaa	yeah your daughter is sexually active at 9 and im 16 and in the 2nd grade.

I would NEVER let her have one - her father threatened to buy her 1 (we're not together, but I am married to someone else for 4 years now) and I told him No...but my daughter IS beautiful - EVERYONE says so & I worry about  this when she gets older, I hope she doesn't start hanging with the wrong crowd!|`|WqkhDIVKaa	Sounds like more than just innocent curiosity--nip it in the bud.|`|rM2hWRVJaa	Ok I dont know if you are being serious or not but I will tell you what I think anyways. I am also 27 year old mom of a 10 year old son and a 6 year old daughter. I dont let my son out of my sight! Why would your 9 year old need a cell phone? She should technically never need to use it cause at that age she should be with an adult. ALWAYS!!! But to answer your question, I would take the cell phone away and ground her butt!!! No more nasty friends and no letting her out of your freaking sight! Do you wanna be a grandma at the age of freaking 30? Cause that is where you are heading.|`|AA10132642	unless  you have big plans on becoming a grandmother like   RIGHT NOW  and no such thing as old fashioned if your concered now YOU ARE HER MOTHER MAKE SURE SHE KNOWS THAT|`|vP9C2QRDaa	I think you should be both worried about and concerned with your daughter's behavior.Your daughter is still so young to be introduced to sexual experiences,even if it is only a text message,because this will let her handle on her own a critical situation,when she is not really mature enough.Your guidance and support is a must at this stage.You should be her crutch to step into this new experience.The psychological and emotional push you give to her will be a great value.|`|m7VBQskEaa	id blame it on you,    your daughter is 9,AND she has a cell phone?    AND you snoop her texts!?    sounds like she doesnt have a pesonal life at all.|`|jBc3PaGLaa	Okay, I DONT think that 9 is too young to have a cell phone. I DO think it is too young to TEXT! Take away her texting! It's BAD. She can't possibly have sexual stuff at NINE years old! She hasn't even had her period yet, right?? WAY too early. She needs new friends!

jTJNOUMwaa	I would suggest stating out breastfeeding and do it for as long as you can before you go back to work or school or wherever it is you may be doing.  The first month or so is the most important for the baby to get the antibodies and such from the breast milk. If you have the time and the patience to always be pumping then that would be the ideal situation since you would get to work and your baby would still get your breastmilk!  I breastfed for the first 6 weeks and after that slowly switched over to formula. By 2 months old my son was formula fed only.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Support will be your biggest asset. Someone to tell you that you are doing a great job and to keep going. Someone to help you trouble shoot should problems come up, not someone who will tell you to go straight for the bottle when a small problem comes up.     You should be wearing gloves if you are going to be physically touching chemicals so that shouldn't be an issue. Other than that I wouldn't worry about it. Your doctor should be able to tell you for sure but I don't see why it would pose a problem.     If you work one day a week you will want to pump while you are gone, at least every 3hrs or however often your baby normally eats. If you don't you will be in pain from engorgement. You freeze the milk and feed that the next weekend. If you can nurse before leaving for class 2-3 hours away shouldn't be a problem.     Good luck with whatever you choose. Any breast milk is good so even if you only stick it out for a week or 3 months or maybe you will make it a year, it's all good.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Breastfeeding is great for you and your baby!!! It also helps you get back in shape!! I breastfed until they could have regular milk. You can pump at work so that you baby has milk while you are at work. It takes a little effort, but it is cheaper than formula and better for the baby!!!|`|UghJ0XROaa	The best advice i can give you, if you really want to breastfeed, talk to a doctor about the risks that may or may not exist from your chem class. Breastfeed at home and pump every chance you can at work or school. If your supply starts to slow down, then switch to formula, but hold onto breast feeding as long as you can.|`|qHykYLQ6aa	A lot of women do both breast milk and formula.  The idea is that any amount of breast milk your baby can get is good.  Ideally you would only breastfeed, but that's not always possible.  It's totally fine to give formula with or in place of it down the line.  As far as the chemistry stuff, I think that as long as you're not ingesting any of the chemicals, it should have no effect.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	If I were you, I would start breastfeeding in the hospital as soon as your baby's born. If it's easy and you enjoy it (the bond with your baby, the convenience), you can look into getting a pump or supplementing with formula. If it doesn't work out, at least your baby got the benefit of breast milk for the first couple of days. And don't listen to what anyone else has to say-Do what's best for your baby.|`|bDuWUBTyaa	Hmmm I wouldn't worry about the chemicals in Chemistry.  I teach chemistry and I am still breast feeding.  ( I pump 3 times a day and bf 2-3 times a day).    As long as you don't drink random metalloids you will be fine.  Chemistry is more about calculations anyway... and you will probably not be in contact in anything more harmful than the crap they put in diet soda (ha!)    Good for you mamma gettin' your school on!
00X4m7vjaa	based on that time you were probably ovulating so your chances are pretty high one time is like a million sprem cells racing to your egg. If you didn't want it you should have used a condom. but you could always wait to take a test when your expecting your next period that is the only sure way to know|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	any time you have unprotected sex you can get pregnant.there is a big chance & there is a chance you might not be pregnant.if you have a missed period next month take a HPT.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	50 50 wrap it up hunny it only takes one time a baby is not made over the course of 9 month you get knocked up with one nice little moment|`|k9nLue0Uaa	You can become pregnant at anytime even ONCE! and right after your period your ovulating so chances are much higher...|`|vGHaYp6Naa	uhhhh....all it takes is once!!!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Pretty high. That's how it's done. It only takes one time. That's how I got pregnant with my first. We had a one night "accident" and boom. Baby. You also happened to have sex around the time that most people ovulate so your chances are very high.    Take a test if you miss your period. You won't be able to test anytime before that.|`|AOfm8ey6aa	If I was you, I would be pregnant now. We are expecting our 2nd child and both of our children were conceived on first try. Some people have sex for months daily before they get pregnant. If you do not want to be a mommy, pray that you are not like me. Because in that case you should start thinking about a nursery :)|`|ltst5ELYaa	20%|`|x4uGfC4oaa	There's no set percentage. If you're ovulating, then it's very likely. If it's after ovulation, there's nothing to worry about. But you don't know when you ovulate...    There's a chance you can get pregnant every single time you have sex.|`|N34q6jlBaa	It depends on the person. It took my boyfriend and I having unprotected sex twice a day for 6 months for me to become pregnant   (and I was not on birth control). A friend of mine only had unprotected sex once became pregnant then once after the first baby was born and became pregnant AGAIN. Just take a pregnancy test when you can! Good luck!|`|zRmHIwwuaa	It took me and my partner 4years to fall pregnant   they say it only takes one time, but hey everyone is different i guess|`|8LZcotkKaa	100%...talk to your doctor, anytime you have sex w/out protection you have an extremely high chance of getting pregnant.

bh6QrzWraa	Communication! At 21 months, toddlers love to be independant and know what is going on. Don't give him too many choices but if you know he is hungery ask him anyway, "Are you hungery?" Then tell him what you are doing "I will just get your lunch out of the fridge for you" and tell him what you want him to do "Can you help mummy by sitting at the table" This makes him really involved in his own care. He is telling you what he wants, you are telling him what you are going to do about it and giving him a way you can help.  Either that or try a time out. Without saying anything, sit him on the floor (between your legs, facing away from you) for 1 minute. Then once the minut is up tell him in words he can understand what behaviour he is doing that you dont like.  Hope this was helpful! Otherwise, there are some great books on this topic at the library.|`|xg4MK2JCaa	A baby will get really fussy during this time. I forgot what it was called, but it's like post-partum depression. If the baby cries, but is not hungry or needs a change, the only thing you can do is hold him/her or leave the room for a while.   You can also have a trusted someone else to hold your baby for you, like a mother, sister, aunt, etc.|`|AA11611165	When he throws a major tantrum, like say, He wants something on tv, but your watching you FAVORITE show, and he has been watching tv all day, so you say, "Wait a second, im watching my show, then you can watch yours." and He FLIPS out. Drops to the floor, screams, ect.Without taking any clothes off or anything, Throw him in the bathtub, turn on the shower, with not cold water, but not warm. warmer than cold but yeah, You know. pretyt much, not warm water at all, anyways, throw him in there, turn on the shower, and such the shower doors or the curtains for about a minute, than look in there, make sure he is fine, and doing that a couple times will stop him. I had to do that with my son at about 18 months. Dropped to the floor when he didnt get what he wanted and screamed and hit his head on the floor. So I did that, and after about 5-10 times of doing the shower, he stopped. Hope it works!!|`|5OP7BRscaa	My son is the same age and he is also testing his limits to see how i will react but i also have a 10 month old and this does not fly with me i don't know how your son is if you feel he understands you (mine defiantly  does) so i have started time out as far as meals go he knows that if he doesn't eat he will not be getting anything else till his next meal i know it sounds bad but he knows now and doesn't put up that kind of fight anymore.We have a mat he knows is for time out and he does not want to go there if he starts being whiny that's where he goes for me this works it would be so hard for me if i gave into his every whim so i just don't and it doesn't mean i am a bad mom i just think if they can understand you they need to know that just as things frustrate them they effect you the same  set some boundaries and your day will go sooo much better  and he will be happier in the end as well.
bcZSIphUaa	I like Lilly.    I think the 2 l's is better.    Lilah is a bit strange.|`|HurPmgSaaa	Lilah Jade is beautiful|`|4U7327Mzaa	I like Lily May but not Lilah Jade.  Honestly, if I was to give my daughter the name Lily May, the May would be Mae.    Lily Mae.    If you are going for Lilah, why not go for the whole name which is Delilah.  And for a middle name, go with another traditional name--not Jade.|`|oxWpo4bqaa	Lily May is beautiful  Lilah Jade is pretty too but Lily and Lilah together are cute, but maybe too cute.|`|7uy8iy7laa	Cute! I like them. :D|`|Tc23KWgzaa	No, sorry.  I don't like either of them.  They might be better with different middle names.    TX Mom|`|ot0TqzSvaa	wow i love both of those names.  and im pretty picky usually.    congrats.    btw - i would spell them Lily Mae, and Lila Jayde, but thats up to you.|`|m7XevWmEaa	very creative!|`|DP48dIxhaa	I love Lily May. I hate Lilah Jade.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Lilah Jade is very nice.|`|GTja6ouWaa	Lily May- Very spring-y and flower-ish; nice name.  Lilah Jade- no comment|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	I like Lily May best.  It's simple, cute, and sweet.|`|0LSuFk4Qaa	Lilah Jade b/c its different|`|d3BZlRyhaa	Lily May is adorable! :)|`|TexOmGk3aa	I like Lily Mae. I really like LIly Grace|`|tJ9zAY9gaa	lilah jade is really pretty but im not so sure about lily may|`|wqbZbwpBaa	I like them, but I wouldn't name 2 children of your family them. Because they are close, and a lot of times you say Lil really fast : since they both start with Lil , it could get confusing. But I love the names :)|`|G6p7QSedaa	i love Lily May|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	I think that they are alright but can you see that these names are going to be serious later in her life? That's what needs to be thought of.|`|ucVDiU7haa	i like both names but prefer LILY JADE|`|gw1N4IF7aa	Yes!! I adore them!!  Lily May- Absolutly adorable!! It is so soft and cute and it just flows so it sounds so relaxed and calm. I really like it.  Lilah Jade- Also absolutly adorable!! I really like this name because it also flows and is really nicly.     I know another name that is kind of like Lilah I think you might like. Liela(lee-luh) It is really pretty and you could do Liela May or Liela Jade or Liela Grace or something. Just a suggestion I think you would like.    Hope I helped!!|`|zBaUWUXfaa	I love Lilah Jade. I'm not too crazy about Lily May- Doesn't swing like Lilah Jade- So original.|`|DM3UQmNQaa	yeah there nice|`|WAHsITZhaa	I love both names very much! really cute!|`|OcZ0NyqRaa	Lily may is my fave, but i agree with operator, id spell it Lily Mae, its a lot nicer|`|7arAmvXAaa	I like Lily May.
cCrwi1Toaa	I think there very classic but yet modern because when your a teen you can go as Kate and Elizabeth because elizabeth is very flexable and you can use at any age and Katherine is also flexible like when a teen you dont want a very classic older name but when your a professional adult its perfect so yes I think they are excellent names|`|sgHvnxe2aa	Very nice....I like chantall...never seen it spelled that way...also, my nephew's daughter is called Olivia...    You're right...I   n e v e r   liked the name Lizzie either...and I would hate being called that if my name was Elizabeth, just as I dislike the name Maggie for Margaret or Annie instead of Anne. Don't care for Anna at all either....  I luv Katherine though, either with a K or a C.   Very regal and feminine and pretty... Don't like seeing little girls with tomboy-ish unisex names or whatever....I'm very traditional on stuff like  that,...|`|OikNR8Ufaa	I think it's weird how people called Katherine are called Kate, but yeah I like both names, traditional names are much nicer than calling your kid Apple or something :P not to sure about the Chantall part, sounds abit chavvy but could be worse :)|`|yzFxc5uXaa	pretty lame they cant have a cute 1st name, its has to be all formal like a 90 year old woman|`|xAdOhtaoaa	i like them. i think they r pretty names !!|`|Xaw48PZ7aa	i much prefer olivia to the name katherine  i dont like elizabeth or chantall  eliza would be pretty tho..    how about olivia jayne  ]  and eliza rose?|`|DP48dIxhaa	I like them.|`|vw7ebwgnaa	I love them! Esp. Elizabeth and Olivia...|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	Our family is the same way about our children's names so if they seem to fit them, then that's alright. But then again some traditions need to be broke like for insists old fashion names are defiantly need to be thrown out.|`|DM3UQmNQaa	sound nice|`|b4G2DbIWaa	Haha Kate Elizabeth is my name! and I don't really like it. I'd rather be an Olivia, Natalie, Bailey, or Blake, Sarah, Remmy, Cameron, or Peyton than Kate Elizabeth.
PFO1jxZGaa	maybe its a 'sex burn' meaning if you had sex the night before and things got heated, maybe you got a small cut down there. It sound like the skin is broken because it burns. I  would just see what happens with it tomorrow and day after. If it gets worse go see a dr, if not then forget about it :)|`|unDHije6aa	Skin Cancer? NO no no...just wondering...maybe...u should REALLY see a doctor...*worried*|`|ltst5ELYaa	yeast infection dear. get monistat
rtcubrgtaa	lol my school doesnt care. i like to pop my gum a lot and i usually do that to annoy my teachers its pretty funny. but it sux for you that you cant chew gum in school. none of my teachers ever made anyone write like 200 words in a row haha not even once|`|5i1J2RLLaa	Swallow it when class starts ;)|`|YJi8CZnNaa	I did it all the time, got a few time's punished but most times the punishment involved spitting the chewing gum into the litter bin.   After i did that i just took a new one.|`|nsAFlZhIaa	I allow my students to chew gum, but if I see (out side of there mouth), or hear it, they get to do 50 push ups, or lunch dentition there choice.|`|pkjtAhA5aa	Yes i chew gum all the time and my teachers hate it! they usally give me a warning but then i do it again so i get like 50 lines and yea. but i am quite good at hiding it lol.|`|E2OKRhwYaa	I once had to write 100 standards in my honors English class back in 7 or 8th grade.    "I will not chew gum in ____________ class again.|`|o3rTWrWPaa	i always chew gum but im like a pro at hiding it.  those are pretty harsh punishments for just chewing gum. most of my teachers just tell you to spit it out and tell you how your not allowed to ever chew gum in their class..|`|vOKGLWGSaa	hahaha in spanish, my teacher HATES us to chew gum, because you have to roll your "R"'s and gum gets in the way, so i stick it to the roof of my mouth and don't pronounce stuff right..  then, in Bio, my teacher doesn't like it, but i am one of the best students, so she lets it slide with me.. =]|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? I would suck it. If I got caught, I would either spit it out, and ask the teacher why it was a big deal. I never got punished. All my teachers were understanding....besides one. I never chewed gum in her class cause she was awful. She would give detention. ??|`|Jucak0HLaa	No,my teachers don't care.Every single one lets us eat and drink in class to.|`|3QCaRYODaa	...........................................|`|pJeFpC7qaa	Its a very strict rule in my school that we cannot chew gum    If we do we get silent lunch    if we get caught 3 times we get a detention    another time, another detention    &and if one more time then you get iss and from there you just get iss every time u get caught    LAME|`|FGZR9RwDaa	yeah i have to hide it too.|`|pcjOQDymaa	i can chew gum in any classes of mine and the teachers could care less. except for orchestra but if we get caught we just have to write out music so its not too bad.   i got caught like in 6th grade (8th now) but never punishment.  teachers chew gum too so it would be  hypocritical of them to get me in trouble:D|`|JtRHGIiwaa	PPSH you said "period"!|`|TcISytjqaa	Once in 6 grade the teacher made me stick it on my nose... DORK!|`|rkdsrfGdaa	none of my teachers care. i mean seriously, if you can't be mature while chewing a piece of gum, what can you do?|`|NW3tKobLaa	lol none of my teachers care  except for my music teacher, that's because the music room is the only carpeted room in the building, so that's understandable  she gives detention for it!|`|fvqXiBEVaa	I chew gum in EVERY class. Even band (which isn't good because I play the saxophone which I have to use a WOODEN reed).    Whenever I need to hide my gum I usually put it in my water bottle (which is usually full with water).    Have I ever been caught? Yes I have and my math teacher made give everyone in the class INCLUDING him pieces of MY gum. I had none left but apparently I had enough to give everyone else >.|`|EccBqsntaa	Yeah. I don't chew it in my last 2 classes. My teacher catches anybody and everybody. He makes you scrape gum. Yuck. I can get away with it sometimes.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	Yea I once got a in school suspension for having violated the rule 5 times. I thought it was a bull s**t thing but I just did it. Now if we get caught with gum my teachers don't care unless its gym, because of course its a "safety precaution".|`|LbNXxRXnaa	I do sometimes. I can hide it in 1st and 2nd period, in 4th and in 6th period. Gym and Chorus I can't because they either give you referals or make you do push ups if they catch you. When I do chew gum, I wrap it up and throw it away. Just tossing it somewhere is dumb.|`|NGk5IrWWaa	i hid in in grade 7 and 8, but in my high school nobody cares, its not even against the school rules.|`|rqlLTEKzaa	Part of the reason they put these rulesin place is because when ur in the working world u cannot chew gum etc...    Just respect the rules/teacher and dont chew gum... u will survive without|`|obJ0dyInaa	a few times, and never got caught :)|`|Cil79o9Zaa	never got caught. =P    our teachers have stupider punishments, that are APPROVED by our principal. the one for my math class is u have to get a plastic knife, and a cup, and scrap all of the gum under the desks after school. its disgusting!    most teachers just say throw it out haha [=|`|OaRR9qoSaa	yeah last year i got caught everyday and got threatened with detention everyday, but they never gave me it. but don't push the limits like i did|`|ZFtMh9tBaa	Ya. I get lunch detentions.|`|GxZVZLlHaa	we're allowed to chew gum in every class but gym and band.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	No.  I chew on it like a beast|`|2lByIoqGaa	Well, usually I don't... but I used to ALL the time in health class (don't have it any more) but the teacher (he was cool :)) LET us chew gum as long as we didn't stick it anywhere! And I do chew it in computer applications even though I sit right in front of the teachers desk, but he doesn't care either i guess as long as we don't leave it anywhere. And in my other classes I do occasionally, but more discreetly (lol in the 2 already mentioned classes I'd blow bubbles xD) cuz I'm not sure how the teachers will react to it. But I would NOT dare do it in my 7th grade science teacher's class lol (now in 9th grade), cuz when she caught you (and she always did) you'd have to come in at lunch and scrap the gum from under the desks >.      I agree sticking it somewhere is STUPID! That is the major reason why most teachers hate it... those lazy kids ruin it for us lol|`|YDs5mdHTaa	We can chew gum in our classes but if they see it we get 1/2 hour after school.|`|7cKskbHjaa	yeap today and i got lunch dentention all next week...|`|fsVX6Udxaa	in middle school, I never chewed gum. Last year(freshman year), in highschool, sometimes I would chew gum. The teachers at my high school don't care.|`|JOR9dSSuaa	in most classes its ok to chew gum... as long as the teacher doesnt see :P  usually they make u spit it out and then lower ur conduct grade... get ur guardian to write a note that u get dehydrated easily & therefore need to chew gum...   good luck :]

VjFCNozjaa	Technically you can do what you want with Jr, or II, but keep a few things in mind if you use Jr or II:    First her entire life people will be saying "Can I speak to MISTER Shannon Smith?"     It will always be assumed she is male    When someone calls your house when she is older it's going to be confusing if they ask for Shannon and you say "Junior or Senior" and they are going to get confused wondering if they have called the wrong number or if you have a son named Shannon too.    My Step-Son is a Junior and it's a pain having two people in the house with the same name.    Would you regret it later if you had a son and couldn't pass your name down to someone who can carry it on to a III, IV, etc? Your daughter will most likely change her name when she marries.    I am not against naming her the second (I think Jr would be a bad idea as it normally denotes a boy) but I thought I would just give you a few things that popped into my head.    There is always using Shannon as a middle name and you could still name a son Shannon.|`|oxWpo4bqaa	I think it depends on the middle name - because if a son has the same three names (first middle last) as the father then its junior so not to be confused.    If your daughter has a different middle name, you don't need to worry about that.      I think thats really adorable - I love the name.|`|cTo5zrF7aa	yeah dude..girl's names dont have suffixes.|`|9g734Pjaaa	This whole idea feels strange to me - strange, not bad - but I love Shannon for a girl. I think she could just be Shannon, but those who suggest Shannon II also have a point. (That's where I find myself feeling a bit odd, though - Shannon the second would be a girl. It's just a new concept to me.)|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Put it in the middle of your son's name, so he has your name, just not exactly.    Shannon Kathleen is a lovely name.  There's one of those in OUR family.    TX Mom|`|NGk5IrWWaa	...what?|`|7jp7sTdFaa	I'm pretty sure it would just be Shannon for a daughter, even if she is named after her father.|`|Pz30pMsQaa	Shannon II.|`|b6mywfBYaa	shannon II      shannon the second  queen elizabeth the second|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Don't think there is one.  Shannon and a middle and last name is just fine.|`|Cq5JM8KTaa	I've heard of a female Jr, but I feel it to be...trashy.  I would just stick with regular old Shannon. There is nothing stating that anyone of the same name has to have a suffix.|`|7xGtL1vxaa	It would be just Shannon. Girls don't get a Jr/Sr. or any numbers.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Shannon is not a unisex name. Why not give it as your son's middle name. It would be much better on a boy than it would a girl.|`|8FJCPV0Xaa	it is the same- junior and senior|`|TexOmGk3aa	There is no status. Women don't do that. My mother's name is Ruth and so was her mother's and they don't go by junior or anything.|`|EzIXF14Jaa	I think it would be the second.  I wouldn't want the second after my name though if I were her.|`|OcZ0NyqRaa	i think it is jr and sr, but personally that would be odd, so maybe name her something else and make shannon her middle name? i have the same name as my dad but id kill my self if i had my moms name (irrelevant of wat it is) it would be a little embarassing|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	It's only a junior or senior if they also share your middle name.  If a girl is named for her mother there is no Jr, Sr, or II.  I think because traditionally it is expected that a girl will marry and her last name will change so there is no need for the distinction between the two persons when they become adults.|`|KK7bnIP0aa	Maybe you could just have her middle name as Shannon. Or just name her  something similar to Shannon like "Shaylie. Shayla, Shana..|`|V1Ev5s1laa	I THINK thats only if the WHOLE name is....like if someones name was Jack Tye Msjakli  and they named there son Jack Tye Msjakli then it would be junior i think....but idk|`|9yJdY4s0aa	Definitely no Jr. at the end of the name.  I encourage you to use Shannon as your daughter's middle name, instead of a first name.      I have a male friend named Kelly, whose daughter is Grace Kelly.   That's a nice compromise.     I predict that the endless commentary over a father and daughter having the same name will be wearing, to say the least.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I would say it would be just Shannon.  I love the name for a boy or girl
2arZOZWgaa	You should definitely let her suck. Trust that I know what a pain it is to feel like you are constantly attached to your little one! Babies need comfort sucking. You can keep trying with the pacifier, as it couldn't hurt, but don't expect too much!     My daughter never took to using one (why would they want fake plastic thing when they can get the real thing ??!!) They outgrow it and you will miss how cute, little, and believe it or not simple life was when your baby didn't do crazy things like crawl, walk, and talk!!    Please take a look at the article below for further "expert advice"|`|wFVLP5l3aa	my son does that and its so fustrating only because once i take him off if i put him in his bassinett or out of my arms he wakes back up and starts screaming lol  if it puts her to sleep and isnt damaging your nipples once in a while isnt bad|`|sMukgX7Xaa	My daughter just turned a month old and she is doing this too. IF she isn't up to a breast or sleeping or being held (and even most the time then) she is crying. I let her suck for comfort until my nipples get sore and then I try to get her to stop by just rocking and singing or whatever else I can do to comfort her.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I dealt with that with my oldest when she was a baby. It lasted until she was 3 months. As hard as it is, even though it can be tiring at times, enjoy it for the time being, because you can't get this time back. It shouldn't last too long, it usually just a phase. She wants the comfort and warmth of you and can you blame her? :)|`|6fiYhtACaa	Why shouldn't you let her?? Your baby is smart. She knows the difference between a lump of plastic and the real deal. It's really not a problem. Just let her suck if you've got the time. This is a normal part of breastfeeding.|`|l9jVMVBBaa	just enjoy the time with her. she wants to be near you is why babies do that. it won't last long. just let her. it will pass soon enough. i actually miss my son (he's 5 months now) doing that, he's becoming more independent every day.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	There is nothing wrong with letting them comfort suck.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I went through this with both of my kids-Luckily it ended up being just a phase. I would "put up with it" for a little while longer, and then talk to her DR at her next check up. Chances are it's just temporary!|`|kzANmJaBaa	she may still be eating a very tiny bit while she's sucking.  My daughter did the same thing, and it is a comfort thing.  In the end it may be more comforting for the both of you (I used to tense up when my baby would cry) to let her continue until she begins to self soothe.  You might also want to try unlatching her right before she falls asleep, in that drooping eye stage.  This way she'll be comforted, but learn how to fall asleep herself.  hope it helped!|`|7U90RM46aa	Honestly this is the easiest time to stop it. If you continue then she will form a habit and if you think she can use her lungs now! Just you wait! As you slowly pull away try to slip a pacifier into her mouth. If she cries try to find another way of comforting her. Hold her close and jiggle her or pat her butt and her back to sooth her. Talk to her or sing. There are many other options. It doesn't hurt her to cry. In fact if you find other ways of soothing her you find a new bond between the two of you. Cuddling is what my family always did that worked. Just the skin to skin contact was soothing enough. You can also like one other said wait and talk to her doctor about it.
HCmAoNjzaa	If you have a 28 day cycle and ovulate on day 14 then you should have the test on day 21. Otherwise have it 1 week past ovulation. If you ovulate on day 15 have the test on day 22 and so on and so on. Not every woman has a 28 day cycle and ovulates on day 14.|`|imFpyj7Gaa	cycle day 21

lDqn5KICaa	I just called Huggies the other day because one side of an entire box of diapers I bought didn't have any elastic in the little blue liner thingy. They responded promptly with a coupon for a free jumbo box, and they included some $3 and $1 off coupons as well.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	I have.  Sometimes they want you to mail them the defective diaper, other times they don't.  They usually send you a coupon for a free jumbo pack and then a couple of $1 off any huggies product coupons.|`|7maTkuQIaa	this isn't really an answer - i've wanted to do that so often!!!  i started putting all the ones with the torn tabs aside thinking i'd use them with some tape or something but i never have.  now i'm on baby  2 and i guess i'll have to be sure to use them this time around since my 2 year old has outgrown all those sizes!    good luck, i've written/called other companies and gotten stuff.
S8okmN6gaa	aww..thats terrible kids can be so mean...well i hope i can give you some help..my son also had long culy hair till age 5..finally he said he wanted it cut and so i did although i didnt want to(it was so cute) but honestly after i got it cut he absoulutley loved it..and i also grew to love it..i hate to hear that kids make fun of your son...may be do you think he would like a hair cut? try a bald fade my son also has curly hair with this it will not look curly but very cute. if he likes his hair and wants to keep it..well he'll have to put his foot down to these kids...tell him to tell them theyre just jealous cause his hair is cute..lol ..hopefully things turn out for ya..good luck|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Tell him to ignore it or tell a teacher. Then I would tell him how everyone has something about them that looks different - red hair, freckles, dark skin, light skin - and none of it is something you should be made fun of for.     Then I'd tell him that someday, girls are gonna go wild over him because of his hair. :) (I actually am *hoping* he gets my husband's curly hair! LOL)|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	why??? Curly hair is the BEST hair.|`|iCLGHUdQaa	I'd do the whole "don't let what they say bother you" speech with him first, but if he would want to, cut his hair.  Or teach him how to style it with some gel or whatever to make it "cool."  Maybe take him to a good hairdresser to have a styled cut.     But, i think it also depends on how old he is and what he wants to do about it.    Ask him what he thinks the answer is...|`|Zfb0s7OWaa	kill  a bitchh. dont let him get pusched around for having CUTTEEE hair. i think curly hair is extra cute.|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	The have some real good hair straightener in the hair care at wal-mart|`|711KONwOaa	buy him a straighter and straight it    or spike his hair    or shave his head(even more embarrasing)    or let him stay that way|`|HqSsNmeUaa	awwwww!  I would be so sad, my son has SUPER curly hair and if anyone ever teases him for it I'll kick their butt!  hehe.  Honestly I don't know what I would do, if it is really bothering him and they are being seriously mean about it I would talk to the kids parents who are teasing him and tell them what they are doing or saying.  Then I would give my kids lots and lots of comebacks to say to their curly hair jokes.|`|AA10730513	It would depend on how old he was and his current hairstyle. Probably end up taking a picture of how adorable it was then get him a short haircut if it was really bothering him a lot.|`|MzUJDQI8aa	haha. i mean awwwww! that is really sad, but kind of funny at the same time. no offense.  i would prrbrably just give my kid lots of comebacks to tell to the kids that are teasing him.  those mean kids will deserve it! haha good luckkk|`|AYyoasvtaa	Tell the people to suck it up. Hair is hair. They may want u to cut his hair but do what YOU and YOUR SON want. I bet he is adorable. My little brother used to have curly hair!!!|`|JOR9dSSuaa	how long is it??? if its longer... then try keeping it shorter because its usually it get straighter as its shorter.  good luck!! and i think curly hair is super cute :]|`|CH9cafwDaa	I would gather lots of pictures of famous, cool and handsome people that have curly hair and show that to him.  Not that he would wave it in front of the teasers' but with the right encouragement he should rise above the non-curlies. Or encourage him to hang out with other curly heads and if they get enough people, they would not be in the minority and the teasers' would move elsewhere.|`|ZejwYamhaa	buy him a hair straightener hahaha|`|in7qi4oZaa	I would tell him that he should just ignore it.|`|db7c12ce76ff7d75c1b0331c96a016afaa	Ask him if he wants it cut short. Let him decide, after you explain how SOME people pay to get curly hair, and that everyone's hair is different (and you enjoy is while he has it!).    Alternatively, teach him a good left hook.
IoWoDxG8aa	i am not really all knowing about the whole pregnancy thing, but have you thought that maybe you have an ectopic pregnancy?   Why hasn't this raised a flag with your doctor? From what I understand, if you had a miscarriage, your HCG levels would not continue to go up. Also, I've heard that some women bleed well into their pregnancy. If your doctor isn't really communicating with you, you should consider finding a different one because if I were pregnant, then I would want to know what was going on and not be informed because of someone else's negligence.|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	If your numbers are doubling every 2 or 3 days, then you are pregnant and I have heard that it is harder for a doctor to see a baby if you have a tilted uterus.  If it is rising slower then that then you are probably miscarrying.  As for the bleeding...I have also heard of some women bleeding in early pregnancy, yet the baby is fine.  Just try to relax...that is the best thing that you could do for yourself and your baby!!!  Lots of Luck and Baby Dust!!!|`|bcZSIphUaa	Go to doctor please!    Endometriosis comes to mind???
pzLDXL6gaa	I don't think so but you don't really have a choice, do you? Go and ask the pharmacist or doctor when you buy it.    Harriet|`|k9nLue0Uaa	Plan B is terrible to take it's bad for you.|`|kWKZoQogaa	Maybe you should invest in better condoms.|`|B7FL0rdqaa	Quoted from the FAQ on their website -     "plan B should only be used in emergencies and not on a regular basis. However, there is no medical reason why you cant use it more than once.    Remember that it should never replace regular, long-term methods of contraception. The pregnancy rate of plan B is calculated for a single use. If plan B is used on more than one occasion, the cumulative pregnancy rate will be higher. Also, if plan B is taken more than once within a menstrual cycle or more than occasional once-a-month use, it may upset your period."    Also you could check out their website - http://www.planb.ca if you have any other questions.    I would also suggest you invest in some better quality condoms, always check the expiration date on the condoms before use, even if they are close to expiring their quality can be reduced by approx 25% which increases there risk of tearing/breaking by an equal amount.
jTJNOUMwaa	Start with Rice cereal. Once he has eaten that for a week or so with no problems you can try oatmeal cereal and 3-5 days after that you can try barley cereal. Always wait at least 3-5 days between new foods so you have time to check for any allergies your child may have to a new food.    I would stick to cereal only until your son gets closer to 5 or 5 1/2 months old. Then do the same thing with veggies. One at a time, 3-5 days apart. Then fruits, one at a time, 3-5 days apart.    I started my son with a couple tablespoons of cereal at lunch and supper until he started with veggies and fruits. Now he has cereal for breakfast and veggies and fruits at lunch and supper. How much depends on your babies appetite. Once they start eating solids the amount of formula or breast milk they consume SHOULD start to go down to about 24oz a day since they are getting calories from other sources.    Good Luck!    *EDIT* My son started with cereal at 2.5 months old because the formula was just not enough. He is fine. My mother started me on cereal at 3 months and I am fine. If you have a family history of allergies than you may want to wait however YOU know your baby and no one can tell you if it is too early. If breast milk or formula is not enough on it's own you should start cereal. The recommended age to start solids IS 4-6 months.|`|FNaCuPyIaa	my baby started at 4 months w/ rice cereal..i mixed in fruits and veggies gradually and now she's been eating oatmeal for about a month. just watch for constipation when he starts out since this a new thing to his little body.. make it fairly watery so he can swallow then gradually make it thicker..|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	Is your baby breast or formula fed, because it does make a difference.    If formula fed, start with the rice cereals.  Get Earth's Best Organic Brown rice Cereal.  It's the best on the market.  The reason you start with this is because it has the lowest allergy risk and is easily digestible.  4 month olds don't have all of the enzymes needed to digest solids yet, so this will be easy on his system, but it could cause constipation.  Mix it until it's runny.  Stick with that for at least 1 week, until he's eating better off a spoon.    Your pediatrician may want you to wait on veggies and fruits but if not start with veggis next.  My ped says green then yellow but I honestly don't think it makes a huge difference.  I made mine homemade, try:  Squash (winter)  Green beans  Peas  Carrots(may contain high nitrate levels so be careful with these)  If you buy your baby food get stage one.  I still have to mix some breastmilk even with the stage one.  try to buy organic as well.  Wait 4 days between each food to check for reactions but don't give the same food for too long as that can cause a sensitivity to dvelop also.  Then fruits to try:  Pear  Banana  Avocado  Sweet Potato (not a fruit, but very sweet)    Start with 1 tablespoion of the food before mixing.  Your baby probably own't finish that the first week or so as he gets used to eating with a spoon and the different flavors.  Feed in the morning or early afternoon incase the baby has a reaction, that way you can get to the dr. and you don't risk the baby being in his crib at night and having an allergic reaction.  Try feeding half way through a bottle, or at the end of the bottle.  Solids should NOT decrease formula/breastmilk intake so be careful about that.    Buy Super Baby Foods  and check out  http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com    If oyu want you can email me too!  Good luck!|`|AA10959932	At this point, its more about training the baby how to eat. The best advice I can give is to feed him until he is tired of it. Shoot for a half a jar.  I'm sure the doctor told you this, but just in case...feed him single ingredient food. Feed him the same ingredient for three days in a row. That way if he has an allergic reaction you'll know the cause.     I just went through this.|`|LTK3It62aa	Yes, and of the single grains are ok to start with (rice, oatmeal, or barley).  Start with veggies so your little one doesn't develop a sweet tooth.  We started with one tablespoon of cereal a day.  Then we added 1/3 a jar of veggies to that a couple weeks later.  Eventually you work you way up to 1/2 and whole jars.  At this time, babies are learning the process of eating.  Most calories are still coming from breast milk or formula.  BTW, avocado is a great first food too!  Check out www.wholesomebabyfood.com.|`|6fiYhtACaa	The new guidelines don't advise solids until six months. Your doctor needs to get with the new info. Start with rice cereal when baby is 6 months.  EDIT: If you want to potentiate the possiblity of food allergies in your child by forcing food that your child really doesn't even need at this age, then listen to everyone else. The new research still suggests 6 months!
BEtNAdaAaa	mines not that great, it was one of those "you had to be there moments, so try to picture it lol.    i was about 8 months along by this time last year, and the summer before that i had been called for jury duty and my dumb *** decided not to go, sooo they called me back for it while i was all fat and uncomfortable and pregnant, and so im sittin there in this really crowded room with the ultimate awkward silence.. all you could hear was an occasional cough, whisper or sneeze, when my normally very active baby started kicking the hell out of me so hard it was practically throwing me off of my chair, and tilting me in diff directions. you could see the bumps sooo well, and i suddenly hear a bunch of little chuckles and snickers around me, and the old lady sitting next to me goes "WOW!! that things playing football inside of you!!"    im an easily embarrassed person so i turned 40 shades of red at that point. everyone else distracted me tho with "how far along are you?" and "boy or girl?" or "do you have a name picked out?" and all the normal pregnancy questions you get bombarded with.       yeeeaaa|`|nudbVzB1aa	hey when i was about 9wks pregnant me, my fella, my bro his (girlfriend who was pregnant) and my little bro all went out for the day we decided to hire a boat and go down the river well it was a really cool day we was taking it in turns to drive the boat any way it was my turn to drive the boat so i said to my fella come on its my turn, bein he was having so much fun he didn want to let me have a go and was going fast, so i got up and walked over to take over. while i was walking he was going fast around a bend and he turn a bit sharpish and i went flying over board it was such a shock and so cold that i couldn breath properly. My fella put the boat into reverse straight   away but it freaks me out as he was heading straight for me and i was worried about the propella and start screaming at him (but he did have complete control i was just freaking lol. so they tried to pull me in the the boat but my breast where hurting so much (as they do in pregnancy) that they couldn pull me in as they was in the way lol. when i then did get in i then had to strip off in front of loads of people as it was that cold i couldn stop shaking from the shock and had to wear someone Else's clothes lol. we have never laughed so much (once the shock went)|`|PFO1jxZGaa	Well one time when I was like 8 mos pregnant with my first one we were at church sitting at the service and I was wearing a sweater ( it was winter) . The baby started kicking so hard that youcould see my whole belly changing shapes and these bumbs ( his arms and legs) sticking out. The funny part was where the old lady who sat next to us almost fell of the chair and freaked out when she saw it.     another time I was 9 mos pregnant and my friend was over and sat on a couch with me and my 18 mos old son( who had shown no interest on my pregnancy) and tried to rub my belly, my son yelled no and punched her on her shoulder. :) I was like wow, he does know that something is going on here    But nothing  much funny happened to me, just weird and embarrassing :)|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	I think the funniest thing that ever happened was when I was maybe 7 months pregnant and we went out with friends where a band was playing.  The music was loud and with every beat of the music my baby kicked to the beat.  I also thought it was funny that when I danced it seemed like my belly moved more than the rest of my body.  The other one is that my baby would get hiccups a lot.  I'd be sitting there working and my blouse would be going up and down and co-workers passing would say "Baby got the hiccups again?" and I'd reply with yes he does.  I had a co-worker that was pregnant at the same time and she would get after me because I would drink a Pepsi in the morning & lunch and would tell me I was going to have a hyper baby that wouldn't sleep and so forth.  She gave up her coffee (I never did & still don't drink coffee) and all caffiene.  She didn't raise her arms above her head (I did) and she was the one who had a hyper baby that slept very little.  My son slept all night long and was a delight to take anywhere at any given time.|`|4GL7CRebaa	am 33 weeks pregnant an i tell you the fanniest thing that ever happend to me is that when i talk to folks my baby starts movinfg outta control and is soo funnyu and cute!!

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? What you're describing can be signs for a period about to start, or like you said, a virus. When you think about something, you can trick your body. Plus, you're young, and first timers always worry about pregnancy the first couple of times. Don't worry about it unless you're over a week late on your period. Personally, I think you might be worrying yourself for nothing. I did that to many times when I was a teenager. You just need to learn to not worry about it unless you're late, or you'll always be stressed out. ??|`|gdvCvWrLaa	I sure hope it isn't a sign.. I am in the same boat.|`|llJERYSXaa	ya it sure is!|`|fvqXiBEVaa	All I can offer is to take a test or see a doctor. But it might be a sign. I can't give you actual experience advice because I've never had sex.|`|WxSQA1ZKaa	That's such a hard thing to know for sure. period pains and early pregnancy symptoms are very very similar. if you are due for your period today you can take a pregnancy test. you can do it a few days before your expected period but that doesn't always work. But sore breasts- if they are wayyy more sore than you are used to getting before your period, are a sign of pregnancy. I know personally my boobs hurt being under the water in the shower! even t shirts were sensitive. if you are sick/ have a cold or the flu then it could be that that is messing with your cycle, but I know some women do feel coldy/ flulike early on in pregnancy. Morning sickness doesn't normally start that soon after you become pregnant but it is different for everyone.|`|b9689fed9476cf1689313993794dc53eaa	Its a little early to tell. Because we have hormone changes during the cycles of our periods there can be bloat, cramping, and sore tender breasts.  In the meantime consider using 2 forms of birthcontrol always a condom and possibly a spermacide.  You can buy cheap pregnancy tests at the dollar store or regular pharmacy.  You can also go to a birthright, planned parent or other place in your area.  I would at least wait til you are 10 days late.  You are young and your body may just be regulating itself + you've been worrying alot it seems. This could definately be a reason for the symptoms.
AA11611165	Thats not wrong? I would do it. Really, in the middle of quiet church and your kid is screaming, your going to cover his mouth. It would be a little embarrassing but yeah...Your fine..|`|TlFnIei0aa	I wouldn't put my hand over his mouth, I don't personally think it's abuse but I know that alot of people do.  The fact that you took him out of the service while he was screaming is respectful enough, most people wouldn't mind if he was screaming on the way out.|`|iLIUoM3aaa	i don't think that was the best way to handle your child, but that person shouldn't have told your husband that. if they had a problem with it, they should have told you.  in church, the best thing would have been to sit near the back and if they started screaming to pick your toddler up and take them out of the sanctuary to a quiet place and put them in time out for two minutes (one minute for each year)    using physical force should not be necessary to control your child.|`|AA11091233	Hi. This is not abuse.     From an outsider's point of view if they had just seen your hand over his mouth, maybe it looked bad and they felt the need to protect your child...but you know...too much abuse has gone on and people don't say anything. So I'd rather have someone try and say a little something if they think abuse if going on...than ignore it.     No one knows what has lead up to the tantrum...it's embarrassing, and also embarrassing to think someone feels the needs to address it and accuse you of abuse when it wasn't.    It's a catch 22. I actually am not even sure why your 2 year old was in church and not in the nursery...not to question that at all...but it is a very difficult age for them to be in church...they can not be expected to sit still and be quiet during a sermon...so I don't know your situation...but I'd much rather see your child in nursery or have a babysitter than disturb services because it's just not fair to have high expectations of 2 year old like that.     I don't think anyone was wrong in this situation...each person did what they thought was best. In the interest of church...forgive and forget. Maybe if you see that person  you can go up and talk to her in a nice way and explain what happened and say you appreciate her trying to protect a child, but it was not abuse and tell her how it played out. Maybe. Or just let it be. People will think what they will think.     Sounds like you're a great mom....so you just have to let it go.    Take care and best wishes.|`|Ybq7kznPaa	OMG It's so embarrassing when your child screams in church! I would politely stand up and remove the child from the church. Explain that he has to use his inside voice when at church. But nah I wouldn't say that abuse. And yes people should mind there business unless it's clearly something that needs attention.
Y2Jjwe6Taa	get to the hospital asap.  it could mean nothing, yet it could be very serious.  probably serious though.|`|R0YkIVlpaa	go to doctor or hospital you need help|`|E2OKRhwYaa	You need to go to the hospital, that doesn't sound healthy at all.|`|nsAFlZhIaa	Go to a doctor as soon as possible.

vACBeHSfaa	If you were using NFP, then had she already ovulated and had a temperature shift?  Just because it was day 23 in her cycle doesn't necessarily mean she was having a regular cycle.  I have ovulated late in my cycle before.  So the big question is did your gf actually ovulate on day 14?  If so, then having sex 5 days before her period would not have resulted in a pregnancy.      However, you would have to look at any other acts of intercourse through the month to make sure that none of them could have resulted in a pregnancy.  If you have been having sex during the fertile time with a condom, then yes - she could be pregnant.  Condoms aren't 100% effective. If she is a few days late then it's about time for a pregnancy test. If it is negative, then she may have a luteal cyst that is causing her to have her period delayed, but not causing a pregnancy.|`|i5iOyCLdaa	It's not impossible. Condoms are not 100% able to prevent pregnancy.    If so, or even if not, I wish the two of you the best of luck.|`|6PNuFgTJaa	You guys had sex during her ovulation period. Most likely time to get pregnant. Get the test.|`|eIIn6WYsaa	yea|`|x4uGfC4oaa	She needs to take a pregnancy test if she's a few days late.|`|SyyBtXFuaa	possible just get a pregnancy test and have her take it|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	If you had sex, there is always a chance of pregnancy.  If you are not prepared for that, stop having sex.    She can take a pregnancy test, though not all of them are accurate this early.|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	It is possible that she might be pregnant. Since she did miss her period, which is the first sign of pregnancy, then you should have her take a home pregnancy test. It should give you the results you are looking for.|`|LZPv8vHpaa	She needs to take a pregnancy test at least 7-9 days or more after the day you had intercourse.      Good luck. =]|`|Ca7Xkjqxaa	Yes there is a possibility. but also mensturation cycles arent on the schedule it could just be late. then again she could be pregnant. she should either see a doctor or take a home pregnancy test|`|MjFVoFXdaa	Could be. She needs 2 take a pregnancy test.|`|VZd8YXueaa	yes. really possible. dont worry TOO much though. if she is young, then the late menstral cycle thing might just be normal. Usually in the first few years, it is really irregualar. look out for other symptoms of pregnancy though. (sickness, moodiness, her needing to pee all the time) those are true signs of a baby buddy! good luck.|`|3zSDxJ4Gaa	if your telling the 100 percent truth about wearing a condom and used it properly she is likely not to be pregnant. condoms if used right are 98 percent effective. get a test better safe than worried....and also who knows maybe she used a condom with you but didn't with someone else. you never know with females these days|`|rv5MWaBcaa	hmmm i had sex with my boyfriend too with condom a few days before my period..    we had a big scare cuz my period was 1 month late..   but i didnt get pregnant..but we got a pregnancy test just in case    so maybe she isnt pregnant....get a pregnancy test
UAunAKdtaa	stool softener may be a littlle harsh on her baby tummy. try feeding her lots of broccoli for lunch and dinner, along with some carrots and stuff. maybe she eats too much solid food. blend those veggies in the blender puree style and serve very warm. be sneaky and add half a spoon of linseed to the veggies before blending, or amaranth seed. blend well. those grains are super super good. massage belly, and go to drugstore to get a medicine for gas. it may not be stool after all, but just a lot of...gas! they tend to get fussy if its that problem.have her drink lots of juice or milk, and do less running around.   i hope some of this helps!

I don't really care for the cutesy names myself. I mean, would you want to be called Bubbles or Skittles? Out of the ones you suggested, I like Leah, Starr, Precious and Prince. Brownie is ok if it's a brown dog but it will be stupid otherwise. Whatever you do, don't name it Giggles! It makes no sense - have you ever seen a dog giggle?     It would help if we knew the breed too. For instance, I named my dog Juneau because she's an Alaskan Malamute and one of my friends has an Australian sheepdog named Sydney. Often it helps to have the dog for a few days before you decide on a name too. It's ok to just call it "puppy" before you decide. Get to know it's personality and a good name might just come to you. The breed of the dog, its markings or its habits can also help you come up with a good name that really fits.|`|vw7ebwgnaa	Leah    Prince    None|`|O9aaX9Vraa	I like Skittles what about Twix? lol my favorite candy.|`|nHNKHrTgaa	Skittels   Buttercup  Bubbles    Prince   brownie  mango
hHEMhPZyaa	Missing 1 pill that early wouldn't do anything. I doubt you're pregnant. I think you're making more of symptoms because you are conscious of a suspected pregnancy.|`|4GL7CRebaa	well here is my story i didnt find out i was pregnant until i wqas almost 5 weeks i did a test onthe midsof  july and it came out negative on july 31 i went to the doctor to get my depo shot and baaangg!! the doctor told me i was pregnat so i decide to go to qn ultrasound place to see how far long i was and girl i was 5 weeks so really you cant tell really doctors go by you last menstrual period to see how big and pregnat you are!!!!|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	You don't become pregnant for a few weeks ( the time that your period comes is when implantation occurs ) Until then the fertilized egg just floats around your fallopian tubes on it's way to the uterus. The body will produce the hormone hcg once implantation occurs. Symptoms can range and be dramatic or non-existent. Most people experience period like cramping and sore breasts around the time of their missed period. Nausea and cravings can begin anytime after that ...Usually when youa re 6-7 + weeks pregnant. You ovulate 2 weeks roughly before your period. Although this isn't ALWAYS regular ( most women will experience at least a few irregularities in their cycle whether they notice or not throughout their life ). If you have sex 2 weeks roughly before your next period, then you miss your period say by a week then it is time to test. Always remember, the missed period is the  1 sign!
o9lQrcsYaa	How would you know what being pregnant feels like if you have never been pregnant before?    If you want to know, go take a test or go to the doctor... It doesn't have to be rocket science!!!|`|7AYnWg3paa	sounds like u really wanna baby.....take a blood test...and if its still negatve then ask for an ultrasound|`|fiUqIyVcaa	Well, you will not feel anything in your stomach fluttering until you are at least 16-20 weeks pregnant.  Not even possible, scientifically or medically for it to be a baby fluttering in there.  Probably gas.  You said you were bloated, so definitely even if you are pregant at this point, it is gas.    Also, the frequent urination with pregnancy, does not occur at the very beginning.  It is caused by increased glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys when a pregnant woman's body starts producing more blood to supply the baby which is filtered through mom's kidneys.    One thing that could be the culprit behind your symtoms is:  New onset of diabetes.  It would explain the increased thirst, increased hunger, increased urination as well as the total lack of energy.  The headaches, dizziness and the nausea can also be a sign of diabetes.    The pain in your vaginal area when you sit down and when you wipe after going to the bathroom, is probably either a yeast infection or a urinary tract infection.  Lower backaches are very common with urinary tract infections as well as the constant cramping and increased frequency in urination.  Even nausea and vomiting are common with urinary tract infections.    You are describing symptoms of pregnancy that occur at many different stages of a pregnancy, not all in the beginning but much further along.  Also, although heartburn is common in pregnancy, it usually occurs frequently after the uterus has grown large with a baby and it pushes up against the bottom of the stomach causing acid reflux and heartburn due to the delayed emptying of the stomach.    If you had your period, you are not pregnant.  Most urine pregnancy tests these days are very accurate and are more error proof than what was available even a few years ago.    It is a wise decision to be seen by a physician for a complete check up to rule out diabetes and to rule out a urinary tract infection or even yeast or std's.  If it will make you feel better, have them do a blood pregnancy test, not the qualitative test that only gives you a yes or no answer, but the quantitative test that will give you specific beta-hcg levels.  These are accurate and without human error involved in the testing procedure, they very rarely give false positives.    If you are only 18, please consider going on to college, and become a career woman.  Having a baby is such a life altering event that changes everything.  After a baby comes along, it is a 24-7 job and is very demanding.  Social life is forever scheduled around baby.  At 18, without a college education, how will you support yourself and your baby?  Minimum wage jobs just are a poor source of providing for even one single person, not to mention adding in the cost of diapers, formula, clothing, toys and necessities for a baby.  How will you work full time and get to spend quality time with a new baby?  If you and the possible father of the baby are not married, what role is he going to want to play in raising a new baby.  If he is 18 too, he has not had a chance to go to college either.  Unless he is rich on his own, and willing to support a baby and you, you may be left to raise your baby all by yourself.  People can raise baby's on food stamps and welfare but it is not easy and there is always things that you want to buy for your baby that you can never seem to find the money for.  It is not a desireable way of life.    Good luck and best wishes for a bright future.|`|qrnAZ2wbaa	oh wow... i think you are difinitely preggo.. CONGRATS. GO TO THE DOCTOR AND GET A BLOOD TEST.. MY URINE TEST DIDINT COME BACK POS TILL I WAS ALMOST TWO MONTHS|`|af86ed385a2842bf70997fb5f4a29179aa	ummmm well first off hunny I can tell that you clearly want a baby I know cause I have been in your boat.I had a miscarriage and it took me two years to get pregnant again.I am now 30 weeks pregnant and there were sooooooooooooooooo many times I just "knew" I was pregnant only to once again find out I wasn;t.It got so bad that it put a strain on my marriage.It took me giving up all hope and poof what happened I was pregnant just like that.The month I got pregnant (july of 2008) I had sex EVERY day and it happened.Just go take the blood test it only takes 45 minutes to come back.Worst come to worst your not just try again it will happen.
lDqn5KICaa	Your kid rocks.|`|PrxlHUT5aa	that is something not to worry about... she is 4yo and it is expected of her to be in a creative play... psychologist even recommend not to give structured learning toys and instead encourage their creativity by giving them boxes and empty containers, old cloths that they magically turn into capes :o)  some kids even have imaginary friends whom they lose and outgrow.  For you not to be at a loss since this is your first child, subscribe yourself to babycenter.com... they will send to your email what to expect and milestones at every age :D now this is a great read for you    http://www.babycenter.com/0_your-4-year-...|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yes its normal, most kids just have an imaginary friend, she is just more creative. Its nothing to worry about|`|JOR9dSSuaa	most children go through this phase. don't worry. give it time. if you want to be safe, you can call your primary physician if it doesnt' stop after quite some time. also you can talk to her preschool / daycare teacher to see if he/she notices anything about her...   good luck :]]|`|nRXMVrVAaa	its ok because shes only four but as she grows older you might want to slowly get her to be more dependant from them|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Do you mean like friends or more like pregnancy type thing? Either way it seems normal. My daughter sometimes talks to herself ect. Many small children do this. Don't worry too much I am sure she will be fine.|`|f4d95cfe6010fdbb2024a827389acfc0aa	like an imaginary  friend?   most little kids go through this stage and most of them that do grow up to be very smart|`|fXmUdJQgaa	This sound strange but normal at the same time.  How does she act around other children? (her own age)? Does she choose the stuffed cloths or other children to interact with?|`|bOxlw3ZHaa	Yes it is very normal, for one its good that she has a good imagination. Plus i believe that most children have an imaginary friend while growing up... I wouldn't worry about it unless shes becomes a teen and still doing it, but she fine....|`|iLIUoM3aaa	from 3 1/2 to four years is when children start playing and telling stories. they develop the ability to assume multiple roles during play. it is normal for her to pretend her toys are people and attend to their needs and talk to them. she is developing normally.|`|7maTkuQIaa	i'm an only child and had imaginary friends.  they had jobs, pets of their own . . . i invented entire lives for them.  my mom said once she tried to include them and set the table at dinner for one of them and i got all exasperated and informed her he was at work!    i'm a teacher and it happens often with young children. i know she's 'making' actual people but i would equate it with imaginary friends and 4 is the right age for that.  i'd let it go on for a bit, i'm sure she'll outgrow it.  if anything starts to get bizarre then i'd contact a professional (things they do, things she says they do, inappropriate touching, etc).|`|IMeHKA3uaa	It sounds like normal kid behavior. Most kids, if not all, do something similar...let her use her imagination its good for her! If, however, it gets disturbing or you get seriously worried about her state of mind ask a professional. Honestly though, I don't think theirs anything to worry about  :)|`|DDSEGWFDaa	When my girls were little the younger one carried a white cloth diaper as her "lovey".  When they were playing and needed another person to fill a role they would use the diaper.  It always had the same name in these situations: Ghost-la.  (It always played a kind of ghost-like character!)  She never called it Ghost-la when it was her lovey, then she called it her Special.    Your daughter sounds imaginative and very ingenious.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.|`|9a8Nfcbjaa	I think that it shows how creative and intelligent she is.  I would have a tea party with them all, your daughter will love it that you are interested...
wipJ9OE7aa	Well my friend had bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Bath Seat. You can find it at Target, I think that it is good because it had like a little net like sling that you can place the baby in, that sits above the water pail below, so you don't have to submerge the child in the water. When you bathe the baby the water can just drip through. I don't know what the weight limit is on it, but you can probably use it without the sling as the baby gets bigger. The link for it is provided below, scroll down and then when you find it, click on the "quick info" link so that you can see if enlarged. The listed price is $34.49
LTD0qL6Yaa	Yes it certainly is possible, it happened to me with my 4th baby. I had been on the pill for 3 years when we decided to start TTC again and i basically stopped the birth control pills had a period and fell pregnant!!!  I'M not sure that miscarriages are passed down from mother to daughter, that one may be  better off answered by your doctor. Good luck.....|`|RdgSFkBLaa	Yes, you can get pregnant. I really dont think your moms history will have anything to do with you. However, miscarraiges are more common than people think.|`|efMkbRCuaa	I've actually heard that you are the most fertile right after you stop taking the pill. I am not a dr so I don't know for sure, lol!!|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	There is Chance. Good Luck
l2BjWA5Baa	First of all, don't make a big deal of it.  Children in primary school experiment with kissing the same way kids in junior high mess around with profanity - it's just something they've seen "big kids" do.  I teach a theater class of elementary school kids and I've watched perfectly normal kids in every gender combination walk around holding hands!    If you fly off the handle, your son may come to associate displays of affection with shame and confusion, something you definitely don't want to do.  Try asking him why he does it! Tell him calmly that that's not something you do until you grow up (and that boys don't kiss each other, if that's the way you think).  If he continues after you tell him it's inappropriate, then be a little more firm (like you would with a potty-mouthed three-year-old).|`|AA12016833	Explain to them that it is not appropriate behavior and ask them to stop. Some children just don't understand what they are doing, and some are just doing it for fun, not knowing its wrong.|`|0LSuFk4Qaa	tell them that boys dont kiss. just explain it to them|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	tell then it's not appropriate behavior, but kids are kids playing around.|`|TJezsCkHaa	explain it.Male and female goes together.Male and Male doesnt fit|`|f5a325bd71925b68d42a9d6bc17b3289aa	They are to young for you to totally freak out just tell them boys do not kiss.|`|jcXSNjowaa	mostly all kids do it..doesnt mean anything..    just try to explain it the best you can..shoudlnt be punished.
ENANtueuaa	Sounds like you might of had implantaion bleeding instead of a period. I think there is a good chance. If you haven't tested, buy a test, and test with your first morning urine. Good luck!|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Well since you did get your period. I guess there is a good chance that your NOT pregnant. But only you can really answer this question, ask yourself these two questions. 1) Are you on any type of birth control method 2) have you had unprotected sex. Both of those questions play a role into whether you could be pregnant or not      Hope everything works out good for you =)  Anymore questions...just ask   I'm here to help|`|9op65iQVaa	yes, possiblility.  The flutter must of been gas. It's too too early to feel movement.  But everything is pretty much what you would be feeling if you are pregnant.  Congrats and good luck.|`|F6jjZEctaa	if you had sex then you might be pregnant . that is how it happens aftter all|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	The fluttering you are feeling isn't the baby that is for sure. You don't feel a baby move until you are at least 15 weeks. Most of the time not until later. If you were pregnant, you would only be about 4 weeks. And the baby would only be about the size of a poppy seed. No way you could feel it moving. Sounds like PMS or a bladder infection. No one can tell you if you are pregnant. But those symptoms are not signs of a pregnancy that is only 4 weeks along.|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	if ur sooooooooooo worried then take a PREGNANCY TEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0cgc0vBLaa	yea  defenatly can be pregnant:)|`|5ORyLk4Uaa	a pregnancy test will tell you if your pregnant or a doctor. it sounds like it is possible that you are.|`|lMUCtrFHaa	If you have heavy af... most prob u are not preggy. If you feel you may be pregnant, why don't u get a HPT to check it out.|`|hHEMhPZyaa	Estimated ovulation would have been about Jan 17th.  Next period would be due approx. Jan 31. Since you've only had spotting and not a true period, you are definitely late.  It's time to pee on a stick.  Good luck.|`|916b9f2e50839abb51e314ab19c8258eaa	Feeling tired is definitely common for the first trimester. The spotting you had could have been an implantation bleed when the fertilized egg burrows into the uterine wall. You wouldn't be feeling movement yet, but dizziness could be chalked up to pregnancy as well.   Sounds like it's a definite possibility. I would get a blood test to be sure and then make plans if you are. Best wishes.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	take a test, sugar. no one on her can accurately tell you yes or no.
X2R2nDmHaa	Hi. You will have to check your lease. Our lease states that we have to have a re-certification yearly and bring birth certificates for any new members in the house but it dosent affect rent.|`|QONFn7vXaa	Check your lease, it probably says only two adults and no children, so then you'd have to tell them.  BUT they can't have you move because of it.  Unless your place is adults only. And unless your rent is based on income then it shouldn't be affected.  And if it is based on income, then it should be less!|`|eya1WDS4aa	No and no. They can not raise your rent just because you had a baby, its illegal and would break the lease if they tried to. If they try to you can take them to court and win.
Lr3lZ4draa	formal/pageant wear for a boy, i think would be a suit or a tuxedo.
pzLDXL6gaa	Last month you could have if you had sex - this month it'll take at least 7 days for you to become protected again. If you wait that long, chances of pregnancy are slim.    Harriet|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	yep, there's always a chance of getting pregnant when on birth control|`|f4d95cfe6010fdbb2024a827389acfc0aa	you know there is a chance if you get pregnant if you take the pill or not.....ik someone that was on the pill and took it when she was suppost to and she got pregnant...you should always have protected sex|`|dcNmRPGPaa	you had unprotected sex so yes, there is a chance.
I0GqKJ0aaa	You should wait at least a month to have unprotected sex after you start taking the pill for it to take effect. After that, it's 99% effective. However, I would advise you to use a condom anyways because of the spread of diseases and something could still happen. I guess he could try pulling out but I don't know if he would want to. Whatever you do, wait a month though just in case. Hope this helps!|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Okay glad you asked the question first before having unprotected sex.     It takes about 1 month from when you first start using brith control for it to go into full effect. Do not rely on them before 30 days. Birth Control is 99.9 % effective if and ONLY if you take it the way that you are supposed to. Condoms are a good choice as well to prevent against STDs.    Just becareful and remember to wait 30 days =)|`|k9nLue0Uaa	wait until your on the second pack to have sex with no condom.|`|Yhw6KwEFaa	there is already an egg there. you can get pregnant at any time|`|iXt3erseaa	It takes a couple of cycles for birth control pills to be effective. So you are not quite safe.    Technically, following the "natural" method, you are not at your most fertile right now. But the "natural" method (charting your menstrual cycle, etc) is only about 70% effective. Are you sure you want to risk it?|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I don't think you understand how the pill works. It suppresses ovulation. So if you keep taking them, there won't be any egg ready to be fertilised. If something goes wrong and there is an egg, the pill will prevent fertilisation. Also, if there is ovulation, you don't know which time of the cycle it will happen. You can't use the natural family planning method while taking the pill. It's only for a natural cycle. So ignore the people trying to give you ovulation dates and the like.    Was that the first active pill you took on the first day of your period? If so, you might be protected from day one, but some pill packets recommend using back-up for 7 or 14 days until protected. Read the pill leaflet!!!! I cannot stress this enough. If you didn't get one, google the name of your pill and read all about it. It's risky relying on the pill if you don't understand it.      If taken properly the pill is 99.9% effective without a condom. However a lot of people take it wrong and get pregnant, so it's good to use a condom for extra back-up.    Harriet|`|yWUQUjx9aa	You have to use alternative birth control methods during your first month on the pill.|`|HJR5ZCpHaa	Not much. Your never really "safe". (I just had a health lesson so I know pretty much). He can try the withdrawal method.     =)|`|UR3MjFLtaa	you should get on the shot. me and my bf don't use condoms and we been together for over two years and still no baby.|`|5HTylrjGaa	Well you have to remember, you're never fully "safe". But I get what you're asking.    Most birth control pills take about 2 weeks to start working and protecting you from pregnancy. Yes technically now would be a good time because there is no egg. But sometimes you ovulate twice in a cycle, and you never know. Once the sperm are inside your body, they can live there for up to 5 days. So what if 4 days from now, your body decides to randomly ovulate?     It is definetly a much lower chance of getting pregnant, since you most likely won't ovulate twice and your birth control is starting to kick in, but if you really want to be on the safe side I would use a condom for at  least another week.|`|sKCGN2i4aa	yeah wait till second pack|`|hHEMhPZyaa	Ovulation would be approx. Feb 13th. However,sperm can live up to 7 days inside you under ideal conditions.   always use a back up method for the first months on BC pills.   Another commenter mention withdrawal method- please note that still leaves semen inside you can you can still get pregnant even if he doesn't ejaculate in you.|`|hQHXBj5Uaa	the safest time to have unprotected sex is right before you get your period, believe it or not because the egg has been released and travels down the fallopian tubes at that point. it isnt at the point for fertilization anymore.depending on how many months u have taken the pill, you could have sex. Generally you have to wait about a month or 2 when u first start taking the pill for the first time so your body gets used to the hormones. it wouldnt be effective right now if you just started taking pills for the first time ever in life. Bottom line: wait atleast until your next cycle of pills.|`|TzLxCXm9aa	im not sure how long to wait after you start the pill, but you wont have an egg until 14days after the 1st day of your period. that is if you have a regular cycle. then your egg is ready for 10-12hrs. just be sure your both safe as far as std's before you stop the condems|`|vFBOFecQaa	When I started birth control my doctor told me that it was safe to start having sex after 7 days.  Of course, there is always a chance of pregnancy on the pill.  Make sure to take it at about the same time every day, a good way of remembering is to set your cell phone alarm.  This will maximize its effectiveness.|`|pLd5gWD5aa	Planned Parenthood says you're good to go.    Most doctors would tell you to wait til your next cycle, but that's mostly just to be extra safe. In my mind, it's worth the wait. Why risk something as scary as getting pregnant?     But medically speaking, if you've been vigilant about taking your pill at the same time every day and it's the right dosage for you and you didn't throw it up (or come out the other end - ew!) then you shouldn't ovulate this month and you have nothing to worry about.
