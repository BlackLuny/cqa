20090202151458AAf81S7	Consumer Electronics;TVs	How to get rid of black bars above and below screen on my HDTV?	I have these bars above and below my Sharp Aquos HDTV screen when I turn the channel to HD.  On my cable box, iO digital, I've found a setting where I can change the bar size from white, grey, and black.  These bars do not appear when the channel is not in the 700's (not HD).  I could go to View Mode and look at possible settings, which include: Side Bar, S. Stretch, Zoom, and Stretch.  The default setting is S. Stretch, which is what I keep it on, but if I go to Zoom it gets rid of the black bars by stretching the top and bottom to fit, distorting the screen simultaneously.  So, my question is, how do I get rid of these black bars.      Answers I have received that are incorrect include changed the View Mode to 16:9, and other settings which are not do-able on a Sharp Aquos.  Therefore, answers by those who actually have a Sharp Aquos, (someone who knows the same wording and menus) would be appreciated greatly.      Thanks for all of your help in advance.

Heres my problem, Lets say "Ted" pays for tv and internet from the cable company. "Joe" comes along and puts a splitter on his line and runs it to his house.Before he hooks up his tv he installs a cable signal amplifier. Now he has TV, Then he decides to get free cable internet by hacking his modem to use the same MAC address as his other neighbor "Steve". "Steve" lives next door and pays for his service.      So is Joe undectable, besides physically tracing his cable from the splitter to his house?

20090202155220AAu2Hx8	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Backing-up PS3 Data For Another PS3 Hard Drive?	Due to the annoying PS3 method where we have to install data from the discs and downloading and installing updates before playing each game for the first time, it's taking-up so much disk space.  I'll need a hard drive upgrade soon.        What I want to know is, can my game plays, trophies and Friends List be back-up and transferred into a new and bigger hard drive?  I can back-up my game plays to a memory stick but I don't know if they can be copied into a PS3 hard drive where they will connect to each game as they are supposed to.  Also, I don't know if our trophies and Friends List is saved in our PS3 internet account where we don't have to back those up.        Also, any installed games that have been downloaded from the internet, can they be transferred to another hard drive?      I have an 80GB-hard drive and about 30% of it has been used due to installations from game discs and updates.  Before long when I get more games, I will run out of disc space.      Many thanks.

20090202185615AA1NHyT	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Can you get a high definition picture with a regular comcast cable box & on a regular tube TV?	I have been begging my dad to get one of those Comcast HD boxes for the TV we have in our living room,it is a wide screen 42 inch plasma screen and I asked my mom was it a HD TV and she said yes,well I thought a hd tv and plasma TV were different,when my dad get the HD box it will be for the flat screen TV,I have a 27 inch Sylvania TV in my room and it is a regular tube TV and I have one of those regular Comcast cable boxes and I sometimes get to thinking that it is a plasma TV because the TV in the front can on on one channel and the TV in my room will be on the same channel and when I get up and stand in front of the TV and then go in my room where the TV is on the same channel as the TV in the front and I noticed that my TV picture looks the same as the one in the front,but I can be watching Wheel Of Fortune and since I will never have one of those Comcast HD boxes I won't get the best out of that,     but I notice whenever a program is in HD I can tell because the picture on my TV in my room will be much clearer,I though you needed to have one of those Comcast HD boxes to get HD service,why is Wheel Of Fortune broad casted in HD if I have one of those regular Comcast cable boxes?    I seem to confuse the picture of the plasma TV that is in the living room with the picture of the TV I have in my room cause both of the pictures look alike,could that because of the cable box and if I didn't have the cable box the picture on my TV wouldn't look anything like the plasma TV picture,    I also seem to think my TV uses the same technology that the flat panel plasma TV uses, but  my TV is heavier than the plasma TV and it is a tube TV and the plasma TV has MUCH more mean settings and picture setting than my TV has.

But since I'm not a Verizon customer anymore I can't pay this online, I tried calling but my number isn't on their records so it can't tell my bill data, I had paperless billing so the only alert I even knew I had a bill was through my email.

I've bought several in the past 2 years so many that I could have bought 2 Ipod's!  My latest purchase is a 4 GB Zen (Creative Zen) for $79.  It worked great and I thought I was floating with Joy and Rapture until I looked down at my Dashboard (I drive a truck for Fedex Express) and to my horror (I'm doing the Macaulay Culkin scream!) it had a blank screen.  Somehow it quit working while I was driving but still played the music.  That's it!  No screen to view.  Still had great sound.      This was 4 days after the store return policy had expired!  $@^&!!%$%#!%@!        I'm still pissed!        Ever have this problem or any problem with any MP3 player?         Thanks and thumbs up (from me anyway) to all who answer.

20090202181548AAhe73Z	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Program to convert protected itunes files into mp3 files?	I recently got a Cowon D2, and I have tons and tons of protected itunes music on my pc.     I did the little trick with burning the songs to a disk and ripping them back onto my cd a few times, but not only is this inconvenient and lengthy, it also lengthens my songs unnecessarily and removes the artist/song/album information from the file. Which is just another hassle.   I tried TuneClone, which works perfectly, EXCEPT it only converts up to 3:00, which is quite annoying as I have purchased songs as long as 8 minutes.    Also, does anyone know whether the free trial of MelodyCan Professional works, in that it converts protected Itunes files?  I'd really rather not download a program that doesn't work correctly...   Eh, thank you. :)

So anyway I was just wondering how I could get it into the audio book section, or if I can, thanks.

I suspect the name and fame gave me a good belief in the "build quality" of such a beast. Supposedly all good grade  components and circuits and cabinetry.    Then, after perfect care and mild usage the thing stopped delivering sound. Not even pre-amp outputs. I suspect it got overheated in the new style cabinet wall unit, but not overly so... I have yet to get the report back from the Lab Testing. But the unit has very low hours...less than 200. And it was always babied.  I don't want to get ripped off for hypothetical repairs. Soooooooo, what generally goes wrong on a receiver such as this?  I mean, I would expect it to last as long as say a tv or something. Or a refrigerator or stove.  How flimsy are the wires inside?  Or components?  I would think they could withstand some heat, for a few hours running.  What can you offer me as hope??

I got my Xbox 360 on Christmas of 2007. So it just barely turned 1 year old. (cause christmas of 07 turns into 08 a month later)..... So i went on the xbox site, and wrote the serial number and all that, but it said my warranty was past, and that the repair would cost $94.... I read on a different question that if you bought it within the last 3 years, Microsoft has to repair or give us a new one for free. is this true?   Please reply ASAP!! Thanks!

20090202201106AA3qF17	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	Is it ok to recharge Li-ion batteries even exactly right after it has just been used? (pls read my scenario)?	I've made a research on Li-ion battery care and maintenance, but there's nothing there that perfectly suits my question.  i purchased a Playstation portable and have been playing it for about two weeks.  i just realized that i have just safely given my Li-ion battery a break-in by fully charging it and fully discharging it in a few cycles.  Now that the break-in period is over, these websites say that to care for them it would be better now that you don't discharge them in full.  At least a half discharge will be ok and you can have it recharged again.  Li ion batteries have no "memory effect" so using the method is an advantage.      but would it be safe, lets say perhaps i just finished playing my PSP for about 2 hours and wish to recharge EXACTLY RIGHT AFTER playing.  Will that be ok?  Wouldn't the battery be in an "exhausted" state and can be harmful to the Li ion rechargeable battery?  Hope to hear from any of you, from experience or from further scientific knowledge.  ThAnK YoU!

20090202203613AAtYDiJ	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Speaker cabinets - kits - would you buy?	Having a fully equipped wood shop and being an advanced speaker builder I was recently asked to build a pair of enclosures for a member of the group that I moderate. That got me to thinking that it might be a good sideline and I'm wondering what the market might be for quality speaker enclosures. The idea is you supply the drivers and the other components, we just build the "boxes." As there is a substantial automotive market we'd offer both home high - fi and automotive models. Perhaps sound re-enforcement models as well. Just so you know, this is an industrial shop, not a residential garage. I'd price them a little under the enclosures that you can find in catalogs like Partsexpress.

I am planning to upgrade my phone to an HTC Touch Pro soon and I looked at the upgrading process to see how much it would cost. I had to choose a few features for the HTC Touch Pro. It said that I had to select a data feature because I was buying a smartphone. I had to chose between an additional $30/month Email and Data plan, or an additional $40/month Unlimited Data Plan. I want to know if, when I upgrade, I can cancel the Unlimited Data feature because I will not use it because the HTC Touch Pro has Wi-Fi capability. I cannot really afford the feature and I don't even need it. So, can I cancel the feature after I upgrade?
