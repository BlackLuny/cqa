jFwuiRKxaa	First of the Hyosung's are not made in china. They are a very reliable sport bike, this company also made motors for Suzuki they have been around since the 60's. And not only do they cost less than a ninja they own them on the road.|`|081d6c7533d0838a91761ef39d234714aa	It's a good bike, but a little heavy for a 250.  A 250 gets really good gas mileage, but it's still quick enough on the highway. In many areas (but not all), you can get really cheap insurance for a 250.  And there's not many 250 sport bikes available in North America; this is a good one.|`|OYIaQjVIaa	The Hyosung in my opinion is not a great first bike. Those bikes are made in China and they are not too reliable and even harder to get parts for. Everyone I have heard from that had one wanted to sell it or get rid of it. They are not engineered well and are made with cheap pot metal. <br>  <br>  You would be better off with a Kawasaki Ninja 250. They are EVERYWHERE and you can get cheap parts for them anywhere or even on Ebay. A Ninja 250 will set you back anywhere from $1,500 - $2,000 used. And a new one only costs $3,000. <br>  <br>  Some other great beginners bikes:<br>  Honda Rebel 250<br>  Kawasaki Eliminator 125 - 250<br>  Buell Blast 500<br>  Suzuki SV 650 (its a 650 but really light and easy to handle)<br>  Suzuki GZ 250 <br>  Suzuki GS - 500|`|xziUHd5Daa	It would be a good first bike. It will go on the highway, but I wouldn't plan on more than short highway rides at 55mph. 250 cc are used as standard bikes the world over.<br>  The only disadvantage might be if the place you are buying it from doesn't also supply spare parts.

51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Yes, this is normal. The fuel pump is disabled for the service and it sets a fuel pump fault code in the pcm. This can be cleared immediately with a scan tool - I wonder why it wasn't?|`|d05a7a6b98fce996f5af07c7de6a5c55aa	Although I agree that this is a "normal" condition, it is NOT the way it should have been handled.  As an auto tech for nearly 16 years I have done hundreds of fuel system services.  The important piece of info is which type of fuel service they did.  One type actually hooks into the fuel system and runs a special mixture of cleaners through the system.  This type is quite messy, and probably not a good idea for a "wal mart super tech" (no offense) to try and do.  The other type is a lot simpler, and quicker, and a lot more common.  This type actually runs a mixture into the air intake system (actually it is a fuel induction cleaning)... a lot more idiot proof.  This is the likely type of cleaning you had done.  The big issue here is that they need to tie into a vacuum source to do the cleaning.  Chances are they left a vacuum tube off.  If they did, this would set a fuel mixture code.  Both types are known for setting misfire codes, but either way, the light should have been checked by the "shop" before it left.  If it is a vacuum leak it should be a quick, easy fix.  I'd go back and get my money back for the poor service you received.  If they give you the run around, just call the district manager.  They take care of these types of complaints all the time.  I've heard that wal mart will refund any work you had done to fix one of their screw ups.  (I've seen a lot of oil pan replacements because of wal mart).  Good luck, hope I was of some help.|`|Ibj3g2wfaa	Hopefully, he disconnected the battery before service and reset codes afterwards.<br>  If all this was done properly, a scan tool will reveal a P1000 code.<br>  This is nothing to worry about, the PCM is relearning a few things and the light will go off in a little as 15 miles, not much more.|`|RiQA4Epraa	ist not normal<br>  <br>  the check engine light comes on cause something is wrong with the car<br>  <br>  go to autozone, and get it scanned<br>  <br>  if it happens to be a fuel related problem, cause i dont know what fuel system service means, then complain to wal mart<br>  <br>  why would you even think bringing your 2 year old car to walmart<br>  <br>  i wouldnt even take a beater car to wal mart..|`|l0ktQUnWaa	Take it in and have the codes read. He could have knocked a wire off of any of the sensors. <br>  Good luck!|`|HoRLhoxgaa	It's probably a misfire code from the fuel system service cleaner being burned. He should have reset any dtc's with a scan tool. Even if he didn't, your vehicle should reset itself after enough good trips.  Later model vehicles reset after a few trips if there are no new faults detected.  If it doesn't in the next few days, get autozone to scan and reset it.

RdswgYNhaa	I was surprised to see this in the boating area, but I just happen to be a pool technician, been one for 20 years. With the equipment running, pick the cleaner up and see if the wheels are turning. If not, do they turn freely by hand? If they turn freely by hand, then you have a plugged jet that drives the wheels, and it is trying to move with only the jet at the back of it. I would recommend you take it in to have the jet cleaned out, unless your familiar with taking it apart. A word of caution though, this is the most common thing that pool stores miss on the Polaris. <br>  <br>  If you don't have good water pressure, try checking the screen where it comes out of the pool wall, at the regulator valve, and that your pump is working properly.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

The chip can be re-programmed (tuned) to provide better performance at the cost of higher fuel consumption or better fuel consumption at the cost of performance.  If tuned correctly with whichever bias you choose, it should not adversely effect your emissions (minimum change).<br>  <br>  However the cons of tuning for performance is that  your fuel consumption will go up and you will invariably drive the car harder (resulting in the reduced life of the vehicle).|`|a1ddcae78f9848320ad0b8246c9c1087aa	May fail emissions testing if your jurisdiction has it.|`|AA11754206	that you are soon going to need that money for repairs since Volkswagens seem to have a million and one electrical problems all starting around 60k.
HDA8Lxv4aa	I think thats overkill for a street car. there is so much to change that i dont think its worth it. It wont be really reliable. after all the engine mods such as heads, camshafts, pistons, forced induction, fuel delivery, exhuast. you will the have to get a transmission to handel all that power, if you are able to do that then you have to find a diff, that wont just spin the power. u will have to upgrade cooling. and the suspension will need alot of work to cope with all the power. you will also need to upgrade your braking system because u will be going fast and sometimes may need to slowdown. Some brembos would be nice but are really expensive which if u do get u will then have to get bigger wheels to fit them, which means u need some really sticky rubber to put the power on the ground, hopefully.theres alot to do and is not worth it. trade your mustang in and get a lotus elise or exige if u want a track car.or if u are a mustang guy look at the roush mustang 427r trak pack. itll be alot cheaper and less of a head ahce. these guys know what there doing. anybody who builds this monster wont know as much. good luck|`|uLEpOpSMaa	To achieve that much street-able power out of the stock 4.6 V8, you'd probably need to do a combination of the following:<br>  <br>  -Stroker kit to raise engine displacement displacement (ex. 281 - 347ci). <br>  <br>  -Strong forged internals in the motor (crank, rods, pistons)<br>  <br>  -High boost forced induction (supercharger or turbo) <br>  <br>  -Higher flowing heads and camshaft <br>  <br>  If you don't do the work yourself, my guesstimate on how much the parts would be with labor would be about 15K.  But it depends on how wisely you invest.  It is very possible, but that is a lot of power for a street car.  The cons are worse gas mileage, voids the warranty, and additional stress on the motor.

TdrgZwnoaa	You may want to check your wheels to make sure there is no snow packed into them. That could cause a mild imbalance problem And if you packed snow around your wheel calipers that could cause your brake pads the freeze to the rotors when they cool down. And if you hit anything hidden in the snow you may have knocked your alignment out but that should be self evident if you drive down a smooth section of road.<br>  <br>   I buried  a 30 foot school bus in a ditch full of snow on a country road a few weeks ago and every time I stopped after they got it out the brakes froze.

DydFQ0fcaa	The heat shields on catalytic converters are important.  When the exhaust gas contacts the catalyst, the catalyst rips a nitrogen atom out of the polluted molecule and holds on to it, freeing the oxygen. The nitrogen atoms bond with other nitrogen atoms forming N2. Both are then let out of the exhaust and into the air. This reaction only works at high temperatures, so catalytic converters tend to run very, very hot. Therefore, they require a heat shield to protect the bottom of the car and any flammable materials underneath on the road surface.|`|0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	Heat shield?<br>  <br>  Your question is vague.....|`|j8ek7F71aa	they're not important at all. they just make the exhust gasses cleaner to help the environment.

Just use a set of Evo engine mounts and a Galant GSR gearbox and you'll be set.<br>  <br>  If you can't get the VR4 engine, the 4G93T Lancer GSR engine will bolt straight in, as it's exactly the same as the 4G93 in your car with a turbo strapped to the side.

Those are the joints that need to be replaced.<br>  <br>  If you don’t have a buddy handy right off, lift one wheel off the ground and move the wheel as if you were turning the steering (wheel) there should be very little play. Look at the cross over steering and notice where ever there is movement, those ball joints need to be replaced.<br>  <br>  After those are all squared up, lift a wheel off the ground and check for vertical play. If there is replace the big ball joints on the Steering knuckle.<br>  <br>  Next, check for play in the wheel all the way around its rotation, at all odd angles, if there is play here you need to replace wheel bearings.<br>  <br>  After each steering component is change you should get an alignment. <br>  <br>  If none of those have play in them, then it is the gears inside the gear box, or if you fix all that and you still have play then it is the gear box.<br>  <br>  Good luck, just throw money at it, it will steer correctly after a while.|`|XI4EceQbaa	Hooking up your power steering will help.

f3b4a3eea25a5783bbde8265b9451986aa	Varies on the state for length of stay in a rest area.  Some states don't care as long as you move on after 8-10hrs, but some like VA have 2 hr limits.  I agree with some of the others.  Rest areas are an option, but <br>  many aren't very safe.  Many are dark & isolated with few people moving about.  Some states, like FL & MS, utilize security at night.  <br>  <br>  You & your friends should either rent an RV or travel trailer, pack a tent, or start checking websites for cheap hotels along the way.  In many cases, you can get a campsite at many campgrounds or state parks for a reasonable rate.  Many campgrounds & hotels have things in the area for you & your friends to do to get unwound before going to bed.  Then, you can get a hot shower without having to stand in line, like you do at many truck stops.  Showers at the major truck stops run $8-10, depending on the chain.<br>  <br>  In addition, you & your friends will not get a very good night sleep because cars weren't meant for us to spend an overnighter in.  Good luck!!|`|Bw18seFqaa	Its legal.. that's what rest stops are for..  to stop and rest while driving.  They would rather you pull over and sleep than to fall asleep at the wheel and cause a wreck.<br>  <br>  Most rest stops are fairly safe..   do practice some safety measures, lock your doors..  go in groups of 2 to the bathroom (expecially if you are a group of ladies).  Keep to the well-lit areas.<br>  <br>  The rest areas on the toll roads tend to be safer.. they are bigger, more well-lit and often have a fast food restraunt, a gift shop, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You can also rest at a truck stop...    you can shower at a truck stop too, but it costs.. I think its about $7-9 for a shower (truckers get free showers with 50 gallon fill-ups)..   depending on how many of you are going, it may be cheaper to get a hotel one nite just for the use of the shower!<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually camping is your other option too.. campsites are cheaper than a hotel.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  My ex husband used to drive truck, and I'd ride with often.  We stopped at many rest areas to sleep...   granted they are not 100% safe, but if you use safety measures, they are fairly safe...

You'll get a more comfortable sleep, use of a shower, and safer, etc.  Although we've never had a problem at rest stops, the potential is there.  We always rotated a sentry.  Park near the rest rooms - higher traffic volume.  Pick a busy rest stop, not one located in the remote parts of west TX or places like that.  Lock your doors and be prepared to lay on the horn if trouble calls.<br>  <br>  We used to camp at KOAs and other campsites.  It was fun, but pitching a tent and taking it down is labor intensive for one night stands.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Usually the rest area will be posted "no camping" or something like that.  You can sleep there for a few hours, but if you are there two nights in a row you'll probably be encouraged to move on by the state police.<br>  <br>  I've slept in rest areas lots of times, but only for 2-3 hours, because it's pretty uncomfortable, especially after driving all day. Whether it's safe or not depends on where you are.  Make sure to lock the doors.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	It's legal to sleep at most rest stops overnight.  Truckers do it all the time.

EnaCCMQJaa	Snap!! The truck I drive - Scania R420 is limited to 90kph, and due to the type of goods carried - cardboard packaging - can maintain that speed all day on all but the most severe hills. I have had to back off on numerous occasions when the vehicle I am overtaking has got back up to speed on the cruise control. Drivers tend to 'set & forget' and have the mentality to match - I'm up to speed & sod you! A little common courtesy is all that is required from all drivers. If some one lets me out when I am attempting to pass I always acknowledge them with either a flick of the indicators or some other method. The biggest problem nowadays is the emergence of  'steering wheel attendants' in place of proper drivers who are employed to do a job & have no real interest truck driving as a career, or would have no idea how to change a wheel if the need arose. I am more than capable of doing so, but in the scheme of things it is left to a qualified tyre fitter to come out do the job. I was brought up with the idea that good manners cost nothing and are free for all to use. When I am driving my car it is the same, I 'respect' the space a large vehicle needs to do any manouvre, and hopefully have instilled into my family the same ideas.|`|8dhe15MUaa	i say not|`|AA12103453	I'm in the U.S. but I always thought part of the issue from Truckers was how the car drivers treat them now. I don't know how Truckers really are now but when I'm driving I try to show them the respect of what they are doing. If I'm going around them I try to get around them quick and out of their way, I won't pass on turns. I just basically shake my head as I watch these car drivers going down the Interstate and pulling up beside the Semi just as we are getting to a turn. I understand the Semi isn't going to make that wide of a turn, but why can't you wait a few seconds and get around the bend so they will have a good view of you as you pass. Then I was watch a semi that wanted to take a turn the other day. He was turning right and mostly in the right lane, going a little in to the left lane. I see him wanting to make the turn so I slow down so he sees that I'm going to let him turn. While guess I should have went up more because this idiot in a van behind him decided he needed to switch to the right lane and pull up beside this semi and take away some of the room, the light was already yellow was part of why I was stopping back, and that van STILL had to stop at the red light.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Yes very much so.|`|4sKs9blyaa	take the limiter fuse out and hold her flat|`|1tilPTPVaa	Let me give the opinion of a trucker from the US.  I couldn't  AGREE more,  there are just enough stupid pigs of human beings driving trucks, to give ALL of us a bad name.  I go to truck stop for fuel only, I'll find another place to eat, I can't stand the sight of drivers who spend more time setting round the counter at a truck stop than they do driving, big stinking wastes of space, that should take a shower instead of playing the pinball machines.  <br>  <br>  I am a 3rd generation truck driver, I can remember when my grand-father went to work in a shirt and tie!,  Those where the days when drivers were truly the "Knights of the Road".  When I drive, its clean dungarees, shined boots, collared shirt, showered and shaved.  <br>  <br>  Driving can be a dirty job, and you are gonna get messy, but what does it take to clean up? 30 minutes??  no reason to look like a damn dirty sweat hog, in filthy sweat-pants and dirty un-tied sneakers!<br>  <br>  The last thing I have to say is that you guys in the UK, gotta get rid of the 56 mph thing, its almost more dangerous not being able to keep up with the flow of traffic, or to get a little kick at the bottom of a grade.<br>  <br>  Just my two-cents,<br>  <br>  Good Luck and be safe!|`|AA11697737	I didn't think HGV's were allowed in the outside lane of any motorway in the UK, so as a car/motorcycle user I'm not bothered what you guys are doing in the inner lanes.<br>  <br>  EDIT: quite agree about the two laners Peter, I live on the south coast and usually find that the HGV drivers are some of the most courteous in the country.|`|GxapFaqtaa	We need to introduce a personality and mental test, my father got run over by one last april and he is 80 years old lost all the skin from ball of foot to calf, still cant walk Doc says 5 years for skin graphs to get back to 75% normality.

Nowadays on that situation, I just wait for the level roads then simply blow past them, and leave them in my dust, those extra 2 miles an hour does make a difference, but yes, it's not like when I was growing up in the 70's when lorry drivers were respected and if a lorry is struggling, other lorry drivers used to slow or stop to see if they could help.

They think there is plenty of space. Some people just have poor judgement. Or maybe there is plenty of space and you just have a bee in your bonnet about it?<br>  <br>  You can usually tell who these drivers are and be cautious of them. They are usually driving a few miles/hr faster than the rest of traffic or they have a bad stopping distance from the car in front. When they change lanes without signaling, they go from the middle of their lane and tread the line of your lane for a bit while they look in their mirror. If they see the slightest gap they move.<br>  <br>  Maybe when you see someone bordering your lane you could hang back a little. It's their bad driving but you can avoid a collision with your good driving!|`|5Af6j1qsaa	Conventions change from generation to generation.  For example, dressing in hippy clothes and saying words like "groovy" were common in the 70's, but now people don't do it anymore.  People used to step outside of a library to use a cell phone, but now they will just talk loudly inside the library.<br>  <br>  Driving conventions went through a similar change.  In the 1980's, if you used the turn signal, cars would actually slow down to let you in.  Sometimes they'll even flash their lights to say that it's safe for you to change lanes.  However, in the 1990's, people started to become aggressive drivers.  Many drivers will literally speed up when they see a car signaling.  Some reasons they speed up are:<br>  <br>  - They are in a hurry (we live in a hectic society afterall)<br>  - They think that you're a slow car, so they want you to be behind them rather than slowing them down.<br>  - Your car is an eyesore, and they'd rather continue following the car that is currently in front of them.<br>  <br>  Personally, I still signal, but I also maneuver my car as well.  I'll start getting close to the side of my lane, so that cars will want to slow down instead of possibly hit my car.  It's sort of like body language; the orientation of your car will signal the other drivers that you are acting....rather than planning to act.  Thus, the other drivers better react to me. ;-P

cYMeZ5CBaa	The 2010 Camry LE's are already on their way in.  My store is due to receive two next week.  The SE's won't be built for a little while though.  Plenty of 09's around with good incentives.  The only major change between the model years is that stability control will now be standard on all models.  Cosmetically, it's the same car.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Correction...Here are some of the changes:<br>  <br>  Product Change Summary<br>  New L4 Engine/Transmission:<br>  Camry will have a new upgraded standard powertrain for 2010. A new 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine equipped with dual variable valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i) will produce 169 hp for Camry, LE and XLE grades. For sporty performance the SE grade gets additional tuning (including dual exhaust) for 179 horsepower, which is 21 more horsepower than the previous four-cylinder engine. The new engine can be combined with a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission with sequential shift on Camry, LE, and SE grades. It’s not only about performance as fuel economy is improved as well with MPG for the manual transmission at 22/33 and automatic transmission at 22/32. {The 3.5-liter V6 delivering 268 horsepower will continue to be available on LE, SE and XLE grades.}<br>  The Camry Hybrid will continue to be equipped with Toyota's industry-leading Hybrid Synergy Drive and is certified as an Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (AT-PZEV). The Camry Hybrid is just one of a handful of cars that meets this strict standard, producing over 70 percent less smog-forming emissions than the average new car.<br>  Safety:<br>  Toyota’s STAR Safety System is now standard on all Camry models and features ABS with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with traction control (TRAC) off switch and Brake Assist. Camry has a total of seven airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag, driver and front passenger airbags, front seat-mounted side airbags and front and rear side curtain airbags.<br>  Exterior:<br>  Exterior changes to the gas model Camry include a newly designed grille and front bumper, an enlarged lower intake, larger projector headlamps and restyled LED tail lamps. The SE also gets redesigned front and rear under bumper spoilers and side rocker moldings that give it a more aggressive and sporty look. The Camry and LE grades feature restyled standard wheel covers. The XLE grade will run on new 16-inch 10-spoke alloy wheels, while the SE grade adds new 17-inch sporty alloy wheels.<br>  The Camry Hybrid exterior enhancements will include a unique hybrid grille, a distinct front bumper, a wider lower intake, restyled fog lights and 16-inch alloy wheels, all of which help to differentiate the hybrid from the gas models.|`|AA12095978	cars for the next model year come out or debut as early as august or september.|`|YTG3bCeDaa	It probably won't be out until mid 2010.  I saw a preview of it on Toyotanation.com and honestly it doesn't look that much different from the 2009 model. I would just go ahead and get the 2009 SE, you'll probably get a good deal and  besides it's never good to get a  redesigned model as soon as it comes out because the bugs haven't been straightened out yet<br>  <br>  -2 thumbs down?

AA10482880	First, there is trade-offs<br>  <br>  1. You planning to keep the motor for a long time, not the car, but motor.<br>  2. Ask for a motor menu service from the machine shop of options. Get the various detail of efforts. There is usually a cost from basic to max, keeping it stock.  Remember, you get what you pay for.  <br>  Note: Custom is another game and usually involves the block too, carb, ingition system, etc. Stay away or be careful, you can get a crate motor complete cheaper for wanting performance.<br>  3.Check if the block is in good shape, KEY !|`|XsZsk55Jaa	If you're talking about doing it yourself and bringing the block and heads to a machine shop then; they would begin with a cylinder head rebuild which consist of resurfacing the valves so they they form a perfect seal, replacing any cracked or burned valves, checking the valve springs for proper force, replacing the valve guides, checking the head for flatness and milling if required.  They will boil out the block to remove all deposits in the oil galleries and coolant passages,   check the cylinder bores for size and trueness and rebore if necessary, check the crank journals for wear and machine as necessary, check the camshaft for wear.  You could simply buy a new/rebuilt crankshaft and camshaft with come with matched sets of bearings.  If they rebore the block you will have to buy oversize pistons and rings.|`|VItj8zdAaa	a complete rebuild is expensive and contains piston rings, main and rod bearings, front and rear main seal, head gaskets, oil pan gasket, timing cover and water pump gaskets, valve cover gaskets, carb gasket, intake gasket, distributor gasket, egr if equipped, i think that's it....
7qr2GprBaa	Why do you need a  new car? Think really long and hard about this. Is your current car costing you a fortune in repairs? or do you just have the new car bug and want something new? <br>  <br>  If the car is in constant need of repairs, then it does make sense to get rid of the car and buy a newer, more reliable car. <br>  <br>  If you just want a new car, my advice to you is to keep the car you have. You should be able to make additional principle payments in order to get it paid off faster, so if you add an extra $50 a month to your payment, you will probably be able to pay it off in a year, rather than two. Then I'd take another year and put the amount you were paying for your car payment into a savings account. Then you should have a really decent down payment on a car, so next time you won't have to finance as much.<br>  <br>  My other advice is when you do buy a "new" car, just get a newer used car. Car depreciate in value so quickly that it's not worth it to buy brand new. Most dealers will honor the warranty of a used car, so look for cars that are a year or two old. My brother is an auto mechanic. He owns his own shop now, but even when he worked for a dealer, he said he would never buy a brand new car. My other brother made the mistake of buying a brand new car. 3 months later he was in a car accident and the car was totalled. The insurance company claimed the car was only worth $12,000, but he still owed $15,000, so he had to come up with another $3,000 out of pocket to pay off a loan for a car he no longer owned. That's how fast a new car depreciates. <br>  <br>  If you do decide to go ahead with your plans, you can't sell the car without a clear title. You will have to borrow the money from someone to pay off your current loan. Then you will have to wait to get the clear title and/or note from the bank stating the loan is paid in full before you can even think about selling the car. Then you'll have to take that money and pay back the person you borrowed the money from in the first place, so you won't have down payment for your new car.<br>  <br>  Again, if you don't NEED a new car, then don't put yourself in a bad financial situation to get one.|`|lLIRIX15aa	You could still list it privately on a website like www.craigslist.com<br>  or something, and if someone is interested in the car, they can come take a look at it. If after looking at it, they are still interested, they can go to their bank and get a loan. The bank will give them a check. You keep the difference of what is made over what is owed Essentially, the bank pays it off and assumes the lien so that the other person is now responsible for it.<br>  <br>  And, usually you can get more money out of your vehicle by selling it privately.|`|cnzse18Oaa	You have to sell your car for at least as much as you owe on it so that you can pay off the bank and get them to give the title back to you so that you can give the title to the person who bought it from you.  That's the way it works.  You can trade it in for another car at a car dealer though.  They basically shift the deficit to the new car note.|`|CED1Bkj3aa	try telling the owner that you're paying for and tell him or her i want to sell my car.|`|wGCCMjVsaa	you cant sell it if its not yours yet, simple as|`|gsPskimpaa	Hello, i am MARY PARKER from New YorK, i saw your question on yahoo answer and i want to refer you to the international loan company that help me consolidate my depth ,when i was searching for loan and i was in a bad shape, a friend of mine introduce me to CLARKE LOAN FIRM that help me get out of my depth, the company offer all kinds of loan to any where in the world at a very low interest rate and even if you have a bad credit and low income they still offer service so long you agree to the repayment information, they are the only international loan company that can help you get a quality loan with a fast transfer without any upfront fees <br>  .contact them and i am sure they will be of great help to you .within 24hours. here is their contact clarkeloanfirm@yahoo.com|`|fKcVpfDxaa	you cant sell what you don't own|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	If you had taken five minutes and looked around on YA, you would have noticed the tens of thousands of other people asking the exact same thing.<br>  <br>  Your only option is to pay off the loan. That's it.<br>  <br>  I've been upside down on a loan before, and I was just incredibly fortunate to sell it for the amount I owed. That's not usually the case.<br>  <br>  In that situation, what you must do, is inform the buyer that the title is on hold. Give them a bill of sale, and take their money. Send it in, and immediately transfer the title to them when you receive it. <br>  <br>  A lot of buyers won't like this, but if you give them a notarized bill of sale, it's as good as a contract to sell, so that puts most people at ease.
RbsRpcIyaa	No, the seller has to remove it themselves. Similar to Craigslist in that regard. It is common courtesy for the seller to remove the ad when the car sells, but some folks don't take that step. My favorites are the ones who get mad if you call about the car, saying "it was sold weeks ago, stop calling", especially if they were too lazy to remove their ad.<br>  <br>  Vehix will cycle-out an ad after 60-90 days, though.

As long as you have a full license, you can drive in the US as a visitor.  If you become a resident, you will need a US license.
8f45f3AAaa	Well, it would have helped me to know that you DO NOT push hard on the accelerate; you just ease on it; the gas pedal is very sensitive. <br>  <br>  Also, you have almost complete control. You can make the car do anything you want it to about. <br>  <br>  Use blinker, check mirrors, and stop at stop signs. Also, if you have to, go lower than the speed limit; better too slow than sorry. But remember, teh gas and breaks are quite sensitive; you have absoulute control.|`|mtU9zP5zaa	Ask a licensed driver to practice with you before you start your driving hours. It's not too hard to drive but practice makes perfect so ask someone to practice with you somewhere safe. My parents let me drive a couple times with them before my test(s).<br>  <br>  Go slow (less than 15 mph in parking lots). Look around at all times watching the speeding drivers since you're in New Jersey. <br>  <br>  No matter what, stay optimistic to get through your test, stay relaxed, and aware.|`|TaZvxS7Saa	You don't get your permit through a driving test, only a written one. The driving is just for practice.<br>  <br>  Listen to what the instructor says, follow his directions, don't break too hard. Let him know that he can be safe with you by checking mirrors, etc. The faster you gain his approval, the earlier the instructor will let you drive on the freeway.|`|FuvCgaEMaa	I remember the first time I went driving my dad took me to a back country road. I was terribly nervous and it took a long time to get up to the speed limit (80km/h) and even then I was probably hanging back around 70 and was so paranoid about crossing into the oncoming lane that I pretty much always had 2 wheels on the gravel shoulder!<br>  <br>  My dad, rather than telling me to straighten the car, would just sit quietly and every now and then mention 'ye'know all these stones are gunna rust the car you'll inherit one day'. That more or less convinced me to keep the car better centered.<br>  <br>  Anyway, practice makes perfect. I would say go to an empty parking lot and practice braking, accelerating, and parking. Also, take the time  to stop every now and then and step out of the vehicle and look where it is in relation to the lines. It may help to find out where the line should be in relation to the car. There's this dimple in my hood, and if I keep the centerline of the road matched up with the dimple, then my tires are just barely on the line... so as long as I keep the yellow line to the left of the dimple, I'm properly in the lane (just don't get fixated on that! Look as far ahead as you can!).<br>  <br>  Now you say you're getting your permit? Hmmm... well then you shouldn't be driving yet then should you?<br>  <br>  Well... when/if you can legally drive (with your observer next to you) I suggest you go to a long country road, and just drive for an extended period of time. A road with no lights, few cars, no stop signs, no merge-lanes. Just a long, winding, two lane road. This is a confidence building exercise and it will boost your morale :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!
GczDsniiaa	just keep to the speed limit.|`|wpgRMjgraa	I found this........<br>  <br>  ***MSN CARS FAVOURITE***<br>  <br>  Provides coverage in the UK and Europe for GPS speed cameras plus accident blackspots, mobile laser sites and high-risk zones.

Not good, when you consider Yamaha had aimed the Bulldog as being a competitor for Buell...<br>  <br>  As a result, Yamaha didn't sell very many and the production run was stopped after only 2 years.|`|qT3bi1Ynaa	Never heard of a Bulldog Yamaha
6uOBkvXRaa	There were two Malibu models made in 2006 the malibu and the malibu maxx.<br>  <br>  We own a 2005 malibu maxx LT and are very pleased with it.  The maxx is a sports wagon (5door) vehicle. <br>  <br>  In the LT trim the car has about every option available included.  Our malibu handles extremely well and delivers excellent hwy mileage (into the mid 30's) and has a lot of room inside.  It is built on a SAAB chassis and has a longer wheel base than the malibu sedan.  it comes standard with a moon roof over the rear passenger area and adjustable rear seats and lots of leg room. With the rear seats folded and the passenger seat folded there is over 9' of storage. It also has heated seats that do a good job of warming us up on cold days.<br>  <br>  The LT version comes with a 3.5 200hp V6. <br>  <br>  You can learn more about the malibu maxx by doing an internet search.  There is also a malibu maxx owners forum in Yahoo groups.<br>  <br>  We use the Malibu on weekends to drive to the coast (about 180 miles rt) and its a fun car to drive, with room for all our camping gear.|`|ZuLjIHgUaa	My Bofriend owns a 2005 Chevrolet Malibu LT which she purchased new.

I would buy something more reliable.|`|vQXYqNkgaa	I have a Malibu Maxx, and I LOVE IT. Very reliable.
04Te5gzzaa	A 2006 Acura TL for only $4800?  There's something wrong with that picture.  The car is worth at least $19500.  I'd ask the owner for the VIN number so you can run a Carfax report on the car to see if it's been in a serious accident before.  Even if you get one, it's not 100% accurate.  I've been in an accident with a previous car I owned and when a buyer ran a Carfax report on it, the accident never appeared on the report.  <br>  <br>  If you're still interested in buying this car, I'd bring it to a mechanic or bring a mechanic to the car to check it out before you actually put any money down as a deposit.  You know how the saying goes...nothing is for free...or at least goes for such a deeep discount.<br>  <br>  As for the car, an Acura is a very reliable car.  It's Honda!  I would buy one in a heartbeat if I had the money to buy a reputable one.<br>  <br>  Yes, I believe this Acura needs Premium gas.  If you put Regular gas in it, it can foul up the car's engine and rob it of it's performance.|`|nAK8bm91aa	Why do women buy a car for its looks?<br>  Its the maintenance you want to know before buying then go for appearance.<br>  If you buy this car and it breaks down,ten miles away, your going to come on answers and ask whats wrong with this car I just bought.|`|DyuXD9Evaa	well it looks good...but i would figure out the size of the engine and its gas mileage...its honda so its gonna be reliable(and for you who say no its not its an acura, then you shouldnt be answering this question,haha) good luck though...|`|5FBlKfQzaa	good car! beautiful. <br>  <br>  But, doesn't it sound too good to be true?|`|wa47F7DLaa	yea i love acuras, theyre very reliable and pretty. it takes premium. but premium lasts longer so its fine.|`|WbmqNSayaa	its okayy.. i would drive it.|`|lH12qmH1aa	they are cute yet sporty. my mom wants that car.

But, If you do want an SUV real bad, I would go for the infiniti first, the audi second, then the land rover. Don't go near the ford escape if your comparing it with these other cars.

cn0ALwwLaa	Yes, you can. It also looks kinda good. I like 16s, but that is me. Also like Plus-1, and original.<br>  <br>  I had the E30 BMW you have. It has the round headlights and clamshell hood. <br>  <br>  You will probably need 40-series tires. I believe it is 335/40ZR-17. Tirerack.com will inform you more. Bridgestone Potenza RE850 I had in 2003, but they have been replaced with Potenza RE960AS, also might be called Pole Position. Get those. They rock, in rain and dry and snow. Trust me, they grip very well.<br>  <br>  Unoficcialbmw.com is the source for all info on this. Spacers, shocks, and springs should go, too. Do it right, and you got it good. <br>  <br>  18s are too big. So are 19s. They cannot fit on this car.<br>  <br>  Kinda like trying to put 18s on a Mitsubishi Mirage. But the Mirage is garbage. the 3-series has been on 10-best list 17 times since 1991 (consecutive I believe) and the magazine gets called Bias because people refuse to believe a BMW anything can be that good. And it is. Magazine defends this. Honda, get over it. You change the Civic every two years. GIMMICK!

XLXncQu9aa	There are a few pros to this argument but there are more cons than pros.  <br>  <br>  Pros:  <br>  *If the driving age stays at 16, it can produce responsibility at such a young age.  Generally 16 year olds aren't responsible, however if they are given the opportunity to drive at that age, it could create a form of responsibility because driving should not be taken lightly. <br>  *At age 16, parents would not have to continue to drive their children around.  They would be responsible for driving themselves which will decrease the burden on parents.  <br>  *The younger you are, the more apt you are to retain information.  As you get older, your memory decreases.  Learning at 16 could be beneficial because your mind at that age is ripe and able to hold information more effectively.  <br>  <br>  Cons: <br>  *16 year-olds have higher crash rates than drivers of any other age<br>  *16-year-olds are three times more likely to die in a motor vehicle crash than the average of all drivers. <br>  *3,490 drivers age 15-20 died in car crashes in 2006, up slightly from 2005.<br>  *Drivers age 15-20 accounted for 12.9 percent of all the drivers involved in fatal crashes and 16 percent of all the drivers involved in police-reported crashes in 2006.<br>  *31 percent of teen drivers killed in 2006 had been drinking, according to NHTSA. 25 percent had a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or higher.<br>  *Statistics show that 16 and 17-year-old driver death rates increase with each additional passenger (IIHS).<br>  <br>  Based on this information, the age should be increased not lowered.

c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Ignoring the reputation & sales philosophy of the dealership:<br>  <br>  1.  Network; inform all your friends & people you meet.<br>  2.  Offer a "bird dog" to your customers & friends for referrals who do buy (dealerships typically will split the cost).<br>  3.  Keep in contact with your customers via a periodic phone call, post card, newsletter, email, etc.  Repeat business if the "gravy" for your income.  (On one occasion, sold 5 cars; 4 were repeats & 5th was a referral).  Others in the family will be needing cars & your buyer will need another one in the future.<br>  4.  Ask if the dealership will split the cost on periodic newspaper ads or radio spots (expense if pretty cheap in small towns).  Coordinate with your manager on promo's - like a live radio broadcast announcing you have the new "Wizbang" on the showroom.  Does the dealership sponsor local sports broadcasts, events, etc?<br>  5.  Evaluate your sales approach.  What fits your personality?  Do you listen, address customer needs or just push a vehicle with the biggest commission?  <br>  6.  Discuss if the lot should have more used inventory.  15 used sounds awfully low compared to 240 new.<br>  7.  Know your product & inventory.  Ever show a customer that they sometimes can buy new for the same payment as used?<br>  8.  Be prepared to intervene for the customer when they have difficulty in Finance or Service.  Have a good working relationship with those departments & educate them if they don't know the customer is who pays the bills.  Of course, if the customer is totally unreasonable (i.e. you can't fix bad credit or if the client never maintained the car...).<br>  9.

New ignition cables are not "wire",they are a thin carbon resistor material, and easily damaged, - and I have seen new ones from box bad! Assuming these are good, then next thing I would check is "reluctor vanes" on ignition sensor pickup! These are the Little things that pass in front  of pickup as engine turns (in old days the equivalent was the "lobes" on distributor that opened the ignition points)! I am not expert on how ignition pulses are delivered on this car, but the principle is about the same on about everything now . there is a pickup somewhere that the pulses to ignition group comes from.  If you only have one coil then there is a distribution system, if you have a "cap" on a distributor (resembles old time systems), the check cap inside for carbon tracks, -- if you have individual coils then it all comes from the pickup on crank somewhere!  My grand daughter has the last one I worked on some Time ago and it still used the 1 coil!
lT4JTq9iaa	If the battery is fully charged, the truck should at least be cranking over, even if the timing is way off.

Don't try to start it! Pull all of the spark plugs, pull the fuel pump fuse or relay, disable your ignition system so you won't have any spark and crank it over.

8fN13NQJaa	I would go online and check car-part.com and see if there are any used ones out there. You will have to paint anyway so the used part will probably be better than an aftermarket fender and bumper which most people sell. If I remember correctly the 300m were all the same body style from 98 or 99 thru 04.  The special edition should be the same fender and bumper as others. You should be able to pickup both for around 300.00 or so,and if lucky you might find one the right color. Labor would cost about 350.00 at our body shop. Not including paint.Good Luck.

aafTqjV1aa	Well, you are talking a really tremendous project. There are actually a lot of groups that have built large wooden ships over the last 20 years.<br>  I know they built numerous replicas of Columbus' ships for the 500th anniversary in 1992. This was in Spain. The thing is, most of them went to museums.<br>  They just finished a freight schooner in Milwaukee that they use as a school ship for teens, and I think that took about 7-10 years to build. One big problem was moving around the heavy ribs and timbers. Some of them must have weighed a couple of tons each.  They got the masts donated by an Indian tribe in northern Wisconsin. They had a huge number of volunteers, the city donated land near the lakefront for them to use as a building site, and there were constant tours and visits to raise money to keep it going. They did a beautiful job, but I can hardly conceive of one person building a ship. You might want to go to a bookstore and pick up a copy of "Wooden Boat" magazine. They have classified ads, and occasionally a pretty big ship comes up for sale.  They also have ads for schools to learn how to build wooden boats, and of course ads for suppliers of such things as sails, rigging, hardare, etc. Believe it or not, a lot of it hasn't changed in 500 years. You might want to buy some plans and build a smaller wooden boat, then if you do a good job, sell it and build a bigger one, and so on until you move up to the Galleon class. There are even people still casting brass cannon, but they run in the thousands of dollars each. But they ARE fireable!<br>  Have you ever visited Plymouth in Massachusetts? They have the Mayflower II on display there, and that would give you a reasonable example of a ship that is just a bit smaller than most galleons.<br>  Also, you can write to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England for actual plans for large wooden sailing ships. You could also write the French Musee de la Marine, as they also have plans for ships that you can buy. Look them up on-line!<br>  Good Luck!

2XusVa4jaa	Since you said you have salt on the road, I'm guessing you live in a cold weather climate like I do. Starting it up and letting it run won't hurt. Don't let it idle too long. Rev it up every couple of minutes. If it sits too long, your tires can flat spot and your brake pads/shoes can get stuck on your rotors/drums. The only way to take care of this is to drive it. Driving it will also get the transmission fluid hot. If you have a hot or exotic car like a Ferrari, or a 1969 Charger Daytona with a Hemi, let me know. I'll clear your engine out for at little or no charge. That's the kind of guy I am.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Not driving your car in a month or so wouldn't negatively impact the car. However, if you want to keep the car in its best shape, you should also rev the car a few times, and if you can drive it forward and back a little, and gently apply the brakes, just to reduce the glaze of rust that develops on the brakes, and to 'exercise' the brakes a little. <br>  <br>  If you were storing it for longer, there would be additional things you would want to do, but it doesn't seem like that is the case here.|`|Gn0kJXHpaa	When you start an engine most of the wear occurs in the first few seconds until the oil pressure comes up to normal.<br>  You do not need to let it run for 30 min. maybe 5 min. the first time after setting for awhile.

AA10419188	I have only been driving about 55 years,- but I prefer a standard any day of week!

You probably will get better gas mileage, as you are not losing power due to slippage of torque converter.  You have control of rpms of engine, as you can shift up or down to get the best power delivery from engine!  You have more control of traction in snow or mud!  If the transmission goes bad, you can generally buy a dependable one from salvage yard, -- (you always wonder about automatics)! ... You can start car under compression if starter ceases to work.<br>  <br>  Bad things, some people can't "walk and whistle" at same time, so standard to complex for them to handle!

FVYN4pdaaa	It can be a very bad thing, depending on what is causing the misfire. If you don't have spark then all that unburned gas is heading straight to the catalytic converter, which will super heat it and melt it down. Then you'll have to buy a new cat for the vehicle. I work on cars for a living and have seen it many times. A customer doesn't want to fix an engine misfire now, so they wait. Later they have to replace the cat which can be as expensive as $2500+ depending on where the cat is located and how much more of the exhaust pipe gets replaced. If the check engine light is flashing at any time, that means that the Engine Control Module (ECM) thinks that the cats could be damaged from the misfire. At that point, he will want to fix this issue right away.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	what will happen is the plugs will fowl out. tell him to check the plug wires and clean the plugs or put new plugs in.|`|AA10562288	Tell him to put in new spark plugs and get rid of the misfire !!!|`|w5BjzqH1aa	Some time it will clean out the cylinder.

If it is not getting any spark it could be spark plug wires or ignition coil pack. But you did not give that much detail so I am trying to help you out as best as I can. Also could be your ignition module another thing could be the fuel pump. Have someone hook your car up to a scanner and get it scanned to find out exactly what it is.

The GTO came in second<br>  1980's - Buick Grand National- Very limited car that was the 1980's stylish muscle car. Second place would be the lamborgini contach. No other car poster adorned more kids walls than this one.<br>  1990's- Nissan Skyline GTR- this was the staple racing car off every racing game. Second would be the BMW M3<br>  <br>  EDIT.. 1980's would have to go with Deleorn.. forgot about back to the future..
Xcwm4gCNaa	a permit is something you get when your 15...you can only drive before 6:00 P.M. not 1 minute after....and there has to be a adult the age of 21 yrs. or older in the passenger seat when your driving! A liscense is something you get when your 16 if you pass! you can drive when ever you want and by yourself if you want also...That's The Main Diff. between the two there's alot more though look it up online!<br>  Oxoxox,<br>  Chels_Z|`|4MtR8MLpaa	If the whole names are used it makes the difference easy to spot. The full and correct terms are "Learner's Permit" and "Drivers License."<br>  <br>  So the permit is used to learn how to drive, practice that is, while the license is authorization to drive on public roads.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	with a permit you have to have a license driver with you when you drive and a license you can drive by yourself.|`|AA10643879	A permit is for a learner,driving with a licensed driver along.A license is a driver all by him or herself.
AA10643879	AC compressor engages when defroster is on?|`|emtkNlJHaa	IT IS YOUR HEATER CORE.  no doubt about it..  you can replace it or you can try a few tricks to stop the leak...the oldest is to poor one whole container of black pepper in the radiator and continue use.  the pepper will swell and plug the hole(hope fully)  it hasd worked for me.  If that don't work..this is going to sound strange... put a raw egg in your radiator (not in the shell).   our you can shell out some greenbacks and have it replaced..you could do it yourself but it is a pain in the @#&|`|EcEMMx2Daa	If you smell anti-freeze, your heater core is leaking.<br>  change your fresh/recirculate switch to fresh air. if you are lucky that's all it is. but the heater core is most likely|`|185740a30616659ae8abf9c04632499baa	your heater core may be leaking causing this . check the coolant level add if needed then take it to your local repair shop for a cooling system pressure test .|`|zOIgzIy4aa	are you and your man making out in the car? just joking dear. check the floor to see if the carpet is wet from your feet.|`|AA10562288	The only hting that will cause fog in the car is moisture.  You may have a leak in the heater core and / or a leak into the auto somewhere that is admitting water into the car , check that the carpets are dry and that there is no water in any hidden pockets in the passenger compartment...

They're not reallly safe compared to a car.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	myself i rather drive a truck then a car. they are built tougher because they are meant for work.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	they feel sturdier and safer because you think they're sturdier and safer just because they're big vehicles. but just because its big, doesn't mean its safe.<br>  <br>  <br>  look at this list of the 20 most unsafe 2009 vehicles, most of them are big suv's and trucks<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.autos.yahoo.com/p/1146/most-dangerous-cars-of-2009">http://ca.autos.yahoo.com/p/1146/most-da...</a>

fe896c388193778daefac15405693e34aa	like the other guy said, waste of money. All these "chips" do are advance timing and add fuel. You can do the same thing by rotating your distributor and removing the vacuum line from your fuel pressure regulator. Also adding a chip requires you opening the ECU, soldering the chip in, and it will cause you to not be able to read trouble codes on the car with a OBD2 reader.|`|ManJOzqgaa	Im sorry but you just got ripped off, and I think it has to be soldered. waste of money

WO68RZdIaa	Law enforcement has nothing to do with lowering your fine & has no authority to do anything other than write the citation based on what they see.<br>  <br>  That will be your job to convince the judge in court that the violations you were charged with are invalid. If the judge rules in your favor, then the citation will be either reduced to a more appropriate violation or dismissed entirely. (Try for the dismissal)|`|x3fQP9viaa	You need to go back and take pictures to validate your case.  Goodluck
81f94cae9e92c26e37d080ed09584eb6aa	any amount of watts you can give a sub is going to give u bass. a five hundred watt amp dont matter the brand, if bridged, should give you bass you can hear and feel. one sub bridged to the amp is the best case scenario. make sure your no lower than two ohm load on the sub cause i doubt the hi fi is one ohm stable. if this is for your car you wont be cracking concrete but you should be bumpin. house will be rocking though. real nice. enjoy and good luck.

EKbsCexbaa	I'll assume you have the stock 3800 naturally aspirated v6. First you can do a Cold air intake kit from K&N, then you can do a U-bend delete option on your exhaust and run headers with hi-flow cats all the way back.  Next, you would want to do a PCM upgrade to adjust your shift points and your speed limit cut off (which should be 106 mph stock).  However, after doing all of these upgrades you will find that the actual weak point of the 97 GP's were the 4t60e transmissions.  If you have not replaced it yet, you will with the horsepower upgrades. Your best bet would to actually try and locate a 97 and up GTP or supercharged V6 and do a motor, tranny, wiring harness and PCM swap.  This will give you your most bang for the money you'll want to invest.  With the upgrades available to the supercharged motors one can make them do mid 12's in the quarter mile.|`|8zVxYkluaa	It'd help if you listed what motor you have......|`|fvN18yvGaa	Udidnt say what motor u have so Im going to guess its a 3.8 6cyl Short of replacing the motor significant hp gaines via a supercharger/turbos wouldn't be cost effective..about the best u can do is change to a less restrictive air filter, cat back exhaust some programming with ur computer, pulleys and ignition upgrades
