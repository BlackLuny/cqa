CeXKPtCRaa	As long as you drink when you're thirsty, you'll be good.  The 8 cups a day was a value a long time ago and does not hold today, since it's different for everyone.  Plus, a lot of foods that you eat give you water that you need (probably more than you think).  Just drink when you are thirsty and you will be fine!|`|HrNhZ7t5aa	...you should drink enough that your pee is clear. <br>  <br>  some people get more water from their foods, and some people dont, so its hard to get a measurement of water. but if your pee is clear and you cant smell it, your doing good.|`|0rfJ0hMcaa	It is healthy to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, but not neccesary. <br>  <br>  I only drink about 2 or 3 and i'm still alive!|`|iOE9EYVLaa	I have heard somewhere that you should drink 1 litre for every 25 kilos that you weigh........|`|ILpp3ncYaa	2 quarts|`|AA11402528	as much as you need, drink when your body tells you its thirsty

EMDNVrcjaa	I like to use a TwixIt to close my bread. My husband likes to spin the bag and then fold the bag down over the loaf. It doesn't really irritate me, but I think it breaks the bread up his way. We leave the white processed bread on the counter, the natural whole grains we have to keep in the fridge or it gets moldy in a day!|`|Elxuvon8aa	I just fold over the plastic and put it into the fridge  I live alone|`|ILpp3ncYaa	i use the twist tie|`|kMEBKq5Naa	We use the twist tie until my husband loses it. We also keep our bread in the fridge. If we buy more than one loaf at a time (2 for 1 sale) we put the extra loaf in the freezer until we're ready to eat it. I doesn't irritate me if someone doesn't like the way I keep my bread. It works for my family, so other opinions don't matter.|`|ZGHDw6sxaa	the fridge works good.  If you really don't eat bread that much then put it in the freezer and just take the slices out as needed - put frozen bread slices on counter in ziploc bag and let it thaw naturally, which will not take long, and you'll have extremely fresh tasting bread.|`|AA11402528	we just twist and tuck<br>  i dont even eat it so i dont care what happens to it lol

You only just noticed it.  It's natural and has a name and a scientific explanation but I cannot for the life of me remember either.|`|BMVLi4Eiaa	This link below will tell you the answer..|`|F3ppjOwlaa	I've seen this before, I thinks it's the stuff they put on it when they smoke it. I would smell it and if it smells ok, it is probably ok to eat.|`|zFSDRzivaa	Cut along the grain, its the tendon in the animal, it's fine.|`|CeXKPtCRaa	I suppose it depends where exactly it is on the meat.  Just so you know though sometimes you'll see different colors in meats than you would expect, and it's where the animal was branded.  Maybe that's what you are seeing?
15338741232fb7ad1aff0ab9e25b791caa	what is UV? and why would you chug something you just found and are not sure of what it is..? oh hell just finish the bottle|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Eat something to try and help it absorb more slowly.  Why the heck would you chug half the bottle if you don't know what it is???  Look on the bottle, does it say what the "proof" is?  If its 60 or 80 proof or higher and the bottle is a liter, then yes you probably drank too much.  If you feel like you have to vomit, you vomit.  Do not pass out on your back or stomach so you don't choke and if you feel very drunk, make sure you tell someone so they can keep an eye on you after you pass out to make sure you don't have alcohol poisoning.  You'll probably be fine, but for goodness sake, never chug liquor, unless you have a death wish.  Do shots and wait in between them!|`|nlIpKw8Paa	What is UV and ur probley just drunk.|`|ytLUphDgaa	Yeah if you don't drink then half a bottle of UV is probably too much, but it just taste sooo good....lol. Don't worry though, if you don't have anything in your stomach then eat something like bread... but try to avoid anything that might make you puke...lol. Depending on your build and any inherited tolerance you should be alright. Just relax and enjoy... but be prepared for a hangover. Drinking water will help prevent this because alcohol dehydrates you.<br>  Good luck, and next time check it out before you down it. Look at the proof and even check it out online...|`|Zr42EFzWaa	I just had some of that last night, really good stuff. I think it is about 30% alcohol (60 proof). Half the bottle is a lot.

RU2Yz6jEaa	as long as the fruits or juice is 100% juice, not from concentrate :-)<br>  you could stomp and smash fruits all you want, but they are still a fruit right? so yeah, smoooothie away! <br>  <br>  and actually canned fruit is still great. its a myth that canned fruits are bad. just make sure it says "packed with water".....not syrup.<br>  <br>  <br>  i LOVE love love V8 splash. it has fruits and veggies ( a serving of each in just 8oz) but it tastes like fruit juice i swear! i am a veryyy picky eater and i love it.<br>  <br>  <br>  easy fruit smoothie<br>  <br>  2 bananas<br>  5 strawberries<br>  2 cups orange juice or pineapple juice<br>  1T sugar if desired<br>  1 c ice<br>  blend till smoothe|`|FjekAwGmaa	The only drawback to juicing the fruit is the loss of fiber. The fiber is in the flesh of the fruit and unless you get a lot of pulp, you won't get it. Overall, this is a good way to get your "5 a day" of fruits and vegetables.|`|CeXKPtCRaa	Nothing is affected by making the smoothies, you still get all that you need!  And just so you know, Bruce Lee, who was probably the healthiest person on the planet at the time, used to juice fruits and vegetables all the time.|`|q4tTabfjaa	yes, but only 1.<br>  what about jordens strawberry clusters, have you tried 'em?<br>  that's my breaky this morn.|`|Xwh96zqcaa	They Definitely count, and handful of fruit in a smoothie is 1 of your five a day. It would be better not to just juice them but put them in a blender with some apple juice so you get the fibre.<br>  <br>  There are Innocent Smoothies which count towards your five a day so making your own certainly would count.|`|2UDbOpxTaa	Yes it absolutely counts. I went to a talk on getting your 5 a day, and the woman presenting said that liquidizing the fruit doesn't even detract from the fibre content (I have NO IDEA how that is possible!) But here's a link to the NHS website that explains smoothies are great:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.5aday.nhs.uk/WhatCounts/WhatCounts.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.5aday.nhs.uk/WhatCounts/WhatC...</a>|`|I3CNklLKaa	Not really - they try to pass them off as efficacious in that department but most of the fibre is destroyed in the smoothie making process. They are full of vitamins though (if you drink them quickly enough after they are made).
0eaFftjyaa	small button mushrooms, whisked eggs, breadcrumbs, plain flour and garlic powder, add the garlic powder to the breadcrumbs. Dip the mushrooms in the flour, then the whisked egg and then the breadcrumbs, It may be necessary to put the mushroom back in the egg and breadcrumbs depending how thick you want the coating. This process is called panne.|`|Wt3t6rUPaa	I dont know about crumbed garlic mushrooms.  But mushrooms coated in parmasan, then fried are amaaaaaaaaazing!<br>  All you need is some good sized button mushrooms with the storks picked off.<br>  Some plain flour, a couple of eggs and some finely grated parmesan.<br>  just dip the mushrooms in the seasoned flour, then dip them in the egg (beat them first of course), and then in the parmesan until they are well coated.  Then deep fry or shallow fry them in oil.  <br>  They come out crispy and tasty and are great served with garlic aioli.  <br>  You can just add crushed garlic to some mayonaise with a twist of lemon to make the aioli.

271e6581641939afd4192f67ff3b66d8aa	A man in recovery shared with me that at different points of his life he had quit pot, cocaine, alcohol, binge eating and smoking cigarettes and that quitting smoking was by far the hardest thing for him to stop doing. <br>  <br>  My 73 year old dad has told me that he still has that urge to smoke after quitting several years ago.  <br>  <br>  Smoking is so addictive and so bad for ones health!  I hate cigarettes.  They stink!<br>  <br>  My observation of pot smokers is that they lack ambition, but I have no idea how hard it is to quit.  I don't think it should be legalized.  It's a drug. It's illegal. It leads to other drugs. (yes it du-uuz!)<br>  <br>  Neither one is better for you. They are both harmful in their own way.|`|A4dGxPUdaa	Both have major risks attached to them.<br>  Cigarettes are bad for the respiratory and digestive systems, in addition to being a major pollutant.<br>  Marijuana on the other hand, has a negative effect on male fertility and human reproductive systems. It's THC component also impairs the memory in the long term. It can be as addictive as sugar, and it is a trigger of depression, neck cancers and chest infections in many long term users.|`|8cd91dcf23c4945b828a8500bd3135aaaa	The only reason people don't die with marijuana is people have limited access to it, it is mostly illegal in other place, its expensive, compared to the cigarettes people can access to it when you hit the right age i even see under age people smoke it and the law just don't mind them. anyone saw a cop arresting a 13 year old smoking cigarettes? i guess not. to cut my answer short both are bad for you. our lungs are designed to inhale oxygen that's it no other compound should enter it but oxygen neither of the two are a good source of that. besides marijuana fries you brain that is why they give it to people suffering with terminal illness. marijuana actually fries the brain get it impaired, so that the brain will be slow in getting signals of the pain that the nerves send. (that probably explains the high and numbness of the body)|`|ytLUphDgaa	Marijuana does have some effects on you health, but no where near as bad as cigarettes. It was only made illegal because back in 1937 a racist asshole decided that it made the "degenerate races violent". Think about this though... cigarettes give you cancer, and doctors give (some) cancer patients weed.....hmmm|`|iC190dpfaa	They both have risks.  Marijuana can cause some problems for people, but when it really comes down to it....Tobacco is so much more toxic to your health.  Millions dead from Tobacco addiction.  Millions in bad health and suffering from their alcohol addiction.  Well, i'm sure there are some people who have developed some problems from weed, but they just can't compare.|`|sPfnudxEaa	actually, no one has ever died from marijuana.....ever. i don't know if i'd say 'better for you,' but cigarettes are definitely more harmful than marijuana|`|m9VCXQPXaa	what i think is that your question should be reword, it should be "what worst for you"|`|udzrBukTaa	Two Words:  MICHAEL PHELPS!|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Even if marijuana was four time worse for you than tobacco like the commercial say almost nobody smokes eight joints a day but lots of people smoke 25 or more cigarettes.|`|AA10758468	Depends on how you consume the marijuana. Smoked materials carry similar risks.|`|8lYZROjuaa	Marijuana is a natural herb with no additives.  It is better for you.<br>  Some smokers of cigarettes have been smoking a pack or so a day for decades, hence the lung problems.  Plus, there are a lot of chemicals added to the tobacco in cigarettes in the USA.  Other countries won't allow it, but America does!  Some of the chemicals USA allows include nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide, as well as formaldehyde, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic, and DDT. <br>  <br>  When one smokes marijuana, the amount is normally not on such a scale as the tobacco.  Like, not twenty or more doobies per day.  I guess that could be why you don't hear about ppl becoming sick from smoking the herb.  <br>  Yes, the herb does have something to it which does stimulate the appetite.  In the 11 states where Medical Marijuana is legal, some doctors prescribe it to cancer, AIDS, and other patients who need to gain weight since the herbs has the tendency to increase the appetite. My sis is a doctor and she truly wishes we lived in a state where Medicinal Marijuana was available.  She told me that 80% of her patients smoke the stuff anyway.  She also told me she'd rather them do that than smoke cigarettes, or drink too much alcohol.  Hmmmm.|`|NNqznf13aa	um you obviously just aven't heard bout deaths from marijuana. but it is less likely to get you killed than some other drugs because its less addictive and the effects aren't as strong as some other drugs. but poeple die from marijuana related injuries/crashes/etc all the time. i think more people smoke cigarettes than marijuana anyway, so its bit stacked to one side.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	marjuana|`|t1wEUS4Taa	cigarettes are allot worse.<br>  <br>  Why do i think this?

c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Did you eat something big for dinner? Food slows down the absorbtion of alcohol a bit.  Usually though, first time drinkers either 1. get drunk very very fast or 2. have an unusually high tolerance.  The latter category is usually true if you have a family history of alcoholism.  Basically you won't begin to feel the effects very much until you have too much at which point you'll skip right passed the buzzed phase right into full-blown drunk.  I was like that when I was young.  My brother was too.  While we ourselves are not alcoholics, we did have a family history of it and therefore inherited tolerance to alcohol before we even started drinking.  When I was young it'd be like sober-sober sober-sober-sober-DRUNK!!  When I drank.  Now that I'm older its a bit more normal, sober-buzzed-tipsy-drunk.  As for your stomach ache, alcohol can be hard on it.  I don't digest it very well anymore so I usually avoid drinking but somedays I'm fine and others I have a huge stomach ache.<br>  <br>  Ah, yeah.  You probably inherited a bit of a tolerance then :)  Nothing to worry about.  Its when you start feeling the effects of alcohol as soon as you start drinking that you've switched over to feeling the drinks like an alcoholic.  But that doesn't mean you're an alcoholic yet.  Its when you crave it and can't control the cravings that you have a problem.  Its smart of you to be wary :)  I'm cautious too for the same reason, but I don't drink often and I figure the day I feel like I "need" it, is the day I stop.<br>  <br>  It was his birthday.  He was probably drinking long before you got there :)  And three shots while your already drunk is much different then three shots when you're starting out sober.|`|t1wEUS4Taa	Maybe you have a naturally high tolerance. Even if the shots were ever clear, its quite possible that you can drink 3 and not get drunk. The alcohol could also cause an upset stomach (most likely on an empty stomach), as drinking shots isn't pleasant.|`|ytLUphDgaa	I don't know what you drank but it was probably something with a high proof. You might just have a genetic tolerance, or maybe your cousin was already shitfaced we he took the shots. There are too many factors to really know exactly why, but it doesn't sound like a bad thing.... unless you were trying to get drunk lol....

EMDNVrcjaa	Facts about milk<br>  <br>  A standard 8-oz. serving of milk provides good to excellent sources of nine essential nutrients, making it one of the most nutrient-dense foods. This means it provides a high level of essential nutrients compared to its calories. In fact, each serving of milk provides 10% or more of the recommended daily intake for calcium, vitamin D (if fortified), protein, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin B12, riboflavin and phosphorus.<br>  <br>  Milk is well known as an excellent source of calcium. Regardless of its fat content, milk provides about 300 milligrams of calcium per serving (8 fluid ounces). The chart below provides information on the calcium content of fluid milk products per serving. A diet that includes three servings of milk (or other comparable dairy foods) each day provides enough calcium and other nutrients that may help reduce the risk of osteoporosis, high blood pressure and colon cancer.<br>  <br>  It is difficult to obtain enough calcium without consuming milk (or other dairy foods). To help meet calcium requirements, the following number of servings of milk (or its equivalent) is recommended each day:<br>  <br>  Children 4 to 8: 3 servings<br>  Children 9 to 18: 4 servings<br>  Adults 19 to 50: 3 servings<br>  Adults 50-plus: 4 servings|`|V1x2UJpMaa	One cup, for both adults, children and teens x|`|ILpp3ncYaa	3 8oz. glasses|`|AA11402528	3 cups

4bedkpvLaa	Caviar refers to the salted eggs (roe) of the fish species, sturgeon. Caviar comes from the Persian word Khaviar which means "bearing eggs". Some eggs from other species ( such as salmon, paddlefish, whitefish, and lumpfish) may be labeled caviar if the name of the fish is included. The three main types of caviar beluga, sevruga, and osetra, refer to the sturgeon species the caviar comes from. <br>  <br>  Beluga, the largest eggs, comes from the species Huso huso. Huso huso typically weigh 80 to 400 pounds when harvested and may weigh up to 2,000 pounds. 15 percent of its weight is eggs. The female Huso huso doesn't bear eggs until around 25 years old and may live up to 150 years. Beluga has a rich, creamy flavor and delicate texture. Its rarity, however, is what makes it the most esteemed of all caviars. <br>  <br>  Sevruga caviar is obtained from Acipenser stellatus. These small sturgeon are usually under 50 pounds. Sevruga is light gray in color and has a creamy texture and strong flavor. <br>  <br>  Osetra (Osciotr), the rare golden caviar (or Imperial caviar), comes from Acipenser guldenstaedti. These sturgeon range in size from 40 to 160 pounds. Although the golden caviar is highly prized, the eggs of this species are often more brownish in color. The caviar has a distinctive nutty flavor. <br>  <br>  Producers and Consumers <br>  <br>  Most caviar production is centered in the Caspian Sea, with the two main producers being Russia and Iran (along with the countries of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan). Sturgeon, however, is not confined to this area. There are at least 50 species in the northern hemisphere and may also be found in North America, China, and France. <br>  <br>  Major importers of caviar are the United States (20% of Caspian Sea exports), Switzerland, Japan, and the European Union (mostly France, Belgium, Germany, and the UK). <br>  <br>  CITES Protection <br>  <br>  All sturgeon are endangered or threatened due to over fishing, poaching, black market trading, and habitat loss. Currently only two sturgeon species are banned from harvesting, Acipenser brevirostrum and Acipenser sturio. Other species are protected by CITES. CITES stands for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Countries may export caviar if they can prove that doing so is not detrimental to the survival of the species. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service must inspect all caviar coming into the United States. Their forensics laboratories have methods of determining the species and country of origin of the caviar. <br>  <br>  Malossol Caviar <br>  <br>  Malossol refers to caviar that has very little salt. With modern refrigeration and sanitation techniques, the amount of salt needed as a preservative is not as great as it once was. <br>  <br>  American Caviar <br>  <br>  At the beginning of the 19th Century, the United States was one of the greatest producers of caviar in the world. Because of over fishing, commercial sturgeon harvesting was banned early in our history. <br>  <br>  Today, mostly through farm-raised varieties, caviar production has returned in America. Some American caviar is very high in quality and has been compared favorably to wild Caspian caviar. <br>  <br>  Caviar and Cheese Stuffed Snow Peas Recipe<br>  This is a good way to stretch caviar for an elegant and easy appetizer.<br>  Prep Time: 15 minutes<br>  Cook Time: 2 minutes<br>  Ingredients:<br>  36 fresh snow peas<br>  1/4 cup creme fraiche (see Note)<br>  1 tablespoon fresh dill, minced<br>  2 tablespoons cream cheese<br>  1 lime, juice and zest<br>  Salt to taste<br>  Freshly ground black pepper<br>  2 ounces caviar (salmon or lumpfish)<br>  Red lettuce leaves<br>  Preparation:<br>  Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and blanch the snow peas for two minutes. Drain and plunge into cold water to stop the cooking process. Using a sharp paring knife, carefully make a slit along the length of one side of each snow pea to make a pocket. <br>  <br>  In a bowl, combine creme fraiche, dill, cream cheese, lime zest, and lime juice. Mix thoroughly, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Gently fold in the caviar. <br>  <br>  Carefully pipe or stuff the snow peas with the cheese/caviar mixture. Arrange stuffed peas on a platter lined with red lettuce leaves. <br>  <br>  Note: Sour cream or plain yogurt may be substituted for the creme fraiche. <br>  <br>  Yield: 8 to 10 servings as an appetizer <br>  <br>  Caviar Torte With Champagne Onions Recipe<br>  Appetizer torte has layers of red onions sauteed in Champagne with cream cheese, hard-boiled eggs, avocado, and topped with caviar. It is a great way to stretch your caviar investment without breaking the bank. This makes enough for a crowd, but you may easily cut it in half for smaller parties. <br>  Prep Time: 30 minutes<br>  Cook Time: 8 minutes<br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 cup finely chopped red onion<br>  1 cup Champagne<br>  2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, whipped<br>  16 eggs, hard-cooked, coarsely chopped<br>  1/2 cup mayonnaise<br>  1 teaspoon salt<br>  1/2 teaspoon white pepper<br>  4 large, ripe avocados, mashed<br>  1/2 clove garlic, minced<br>  2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice<br>  1/2 ounce black caviar or lumpfish roe<br>  Water cracke|`|m9VCXQPXaa	yes that's why it's expensive. there are 3 kinds of caviar.

4bedkpvLaa	It probably wouldn't be on the menu for your mother-in-law's first dinner visit, and it isn't exactly gourmet fare, but macaroni and cheese is one of the most popular--if not the most popular--American comfort foods. Nearly every soul food cookbook and many Southern cookbooks have recipes for the American favorite, with few differences from one to the next. <br>  Some believe the dish was created by founding father Thomas Jefferson, known for his great interest in food, and in a 1996 "Restaurants & Institutions" article, Barbara Bell Matuszewski wrote that Jefferson served the dish in the White House in 1802. However, noted food historian Karen Hess claims Jefferson did not invent the dish, though he did return from a trip to Paris with a macaroni mold. In the Featured Recipes, you'll find a recipe for the dish from Mary Randolph's (Jefferson's cousin) "The Virginia Housewife," first published in 1824.<br>  <br>  According to John Mariani, author of "The Dictionary of American Food and Drink," macaroni and cheese was first made in the nineteenth century, but it took on a even greater popularity when Kraft Foods introduced the Kraft Dinner (macaroni and cheese) in 1937. According to a company spokesperson, Kraft now sells more than one million boxes of the dinners every day! The Kraft dinners are so popular, in fact, that children and some adults have been known to turn up their noses when offered a rich and delicious homemade version.<br>  <br>  Homemade macaroni and cheese can be a simple layering of cooked macaroni, shredded (or sliced) cheese and salt and pepper, or it can be made with a white sauce-cheese base, topped with more cheese and buttered crumbs before baking. This ever-so-humble dish is delicious and satisfying as is, but you can jazz it up (homemade or package version) with the addition of chopped vegetables, meat, fish or poultry, or your favorite herbs or spices.

7swefA6Paa	Ok so this is going to be very long, but im going to tell you from past experiences (some of them bad) the best way to lose weight :D<br>  ok so... the best way to boost your metabolism(which will make you burn fat better) and reduce hunger during the day, is to eat how i do:  I eat about 200 calories every two to three hours, starting in the morning around 7:30 am to no later than 7pm.  never eat after 7 (6 is best), unless you plan on staying up all night, for your metabolism slows at night because its preparing to sleep.  .  <br>  oh and eat a ton of veggies because they are very filling and low cal.  fruit too.  some other low cal foods: nonfat cottage cheese, lite jellos; cheese sticks; yogurts; soups; or tuna, grahm crackers, kix cereal,  pria power bars, soy, etc.  if you like almonds, try almond milk instead of regular milk, it is easier to digest and the unsweetened kind is 40 cal per cup. <br>   Oh, and because you get to look forward to another mini meal in 2 hours, you will be less hungry and less likely to snack on things.  especially because you will be full  on water too.  if you eat 200 cal every 2hrs from 8:am-6pm you will only consume 1200cal in a day.  <br>  but dont eat less than, at the very least, 1000 cal (though most  suggest no less than 1200) because  then your body goes into starvation mode and stores everything you eat into fat for energy. so even though youd be losing weight, youd be losing muscle but keeping fat.  and if you binged or started eating more daily then youd gain the weight back twice as fast. <br>  and it is a good idea to buy some 3-6lbs weights and do simple exercises to build muscle and look toned.  And the more muscle you have, the more you can eat in a day because muscle burns fat even when you are just sitting.  Like 3 days a week do 2 sets of bicep and tricep curls, and then 2 days a week do squats, lunges, crunches, etc.  an add at least 20 min of cardio daily. <br>  <br>  I hope that was helpful|`|V1x2UJpMaa	Eat lots of veg and water, bread and carbs only sometimes, get multivitamins.

4bedkpvLaa	from four chains—Dunkin' Donuts, Krispy Kreme, Starbucks, and Tim Hortons—across the U.S. These stores all claim they've removed trans fat from their doughnuts. So I <br>   had a lab analyze the ever-popular glazed and Boston Cream varieties for trans fat, saturated fat, and total fat.<br>  <br>  All were legally trans-fat-free (meaning they contained less than 0.5 gram per doughnut) but technically not, since each sample had traces of trans fat present. Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, manufacturers can declare their product trans-fat-free if it contains less than 0.5 gram of trans fat per serving.<br>  <br>  Chocolate-iced, custard-filled doughnuts I tested still had traces of trans fat present.Among the samples tested, the Starbucks glazed doughnut was the heftiest at 4.2 ounces, and had the highest total fat content (22.9 grams) and saturated fat (11.4 grams). Tim Hortons' honey dip doughnut came in with the lowest numbers for total fat (5.7 grams) and saturated fat (2.5 grams).<br>  <br>  As an expert scientist on this subject and nutritionist I reccomend that  that no more that 1 percent of your total daily calories be from trans fat. So for a 2,000 calorie diet, that means a total of about 2 grams of trans fat per day. There's no kidding yourself that even legally trans-fat-free doughnuts are healthy. Based on my tests, all four chains are living up to their trans-fat claims, but these doughnuts—at between 200 and almost 500 calories a shot (based on manufacturer information), plus up to 23 grams of total fat (and 11 grams of saturated fat)—should be treated as an occasional indulgence only.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	donuts yes <br>  marshmallows no|`|uap6JAqQaa	in answer to your second question, marshmallows have no fat period. so, no trans fats.

The only difference between a kabob and open grilling is that you put stuff on a stick. Meat with a high fat content tends to fall apart as the fat comes out more than lean meat. I prefer beef, personally, and I've found any cut with LOIN in the name is perfect. The only chicken parts I've used are breasts and tenders, cubed of course. With beef, almost ANY cut will do, likewise with pork. Fish tends to cook really fast, so you might want to precook the veggies half way before stacking a kabob and finishing the grilling. You haven't had anything until you have had the mystery meat sold from a cart on the streets overseas... My personal favorite was octopus that I found in Japan.

The first few months are always the hardest while everyone who is close to you adjusts to your new big change. <br>  <br>  The first thing to do is talk with your parents.

It may be worthwhile to find a vegetarian multi vitamin for yourself because trust me deficiencies suck!<br>  <br>  In regards to your friends it may be worth it to also explain to them that you cannot eat meat whatsoever because it's against your new beliefs good friends are usually very understanding and sympathetic to the idea of vegetarianism. If they're not or they cannot offer you vegetarian foods then simply kindly refuse don't feel bad if you have to!

Vegetarian dogs tend to be healthier when its a vegan diet with no dairy and also no soya or processed food.  A home made diet.  A typical diet would be muesli with oats, nuts, seeds, fruit (without milk) for breakfast and grains, legumes and veg for dinner.  The oldest dog in the world for a while was Brambles who ate a big bowl of wholegrain rice, lentils and organic vegetables every evening.  She was 29 and still went swimming for half an hour at a time.  In the wild vegetarian animals live longer than the carnivores though not necessarily healthier.  Endless studies have shown vegetarian diets increase longevity.  Digesting meat is exhausting for the body - digesting plants puts much less strain on it.  <br>  <br>  Some dogs are also happy on it.<br>  However mine are not.  I tried feeding my last 3 dogs a vegetarian diet and 2 of them were absolutely miserable.  The little lhasa apso was perfectly happy - his favourite foods were raw potatoes and raw carrots anyway, he'd always gone crazy for those.  His second favourite foods were cooked potatoes and carrots.  Then meat.  So he didnt mind at all and loved eating all his veg.  But the other two - big wolfy dogs - looked at me as if I was insane.  One of them looked down his nose at the food and gave me filthy looks.  The other one wouldnt speak to me.  Literally.<br>  So in the end after going to great lengthens to make their meals tasty ("Oh thats ridiculous doing all that for a dog!") I gave up and went back to buying dog food.<br>  <br>  I now have two border collies and while they like vegetarian food if it is accompanied by meat they hate it by itself.  So I used to feed 50% vegan (lentils, rice and vegetables for dinner, oats for breakfast) and 50% dogfood.  This meant I cut their meat consumption by half.  I am now trying to find a way to feed them on meat that people throw away as this wouldnt affect the farm animals.  People give me their leftovers, and some shops do.  But I don't yet get enough to stop buying dogfood.  I am working on it though.<br>  If I ever adopt a puppy and dont have any adult dogs living with me I will raise it on a vegetarian diet - as it wouldnt miss what its never had.  There are many dogs who are happy eating that way.<br>  <br>  As for cats - I hope to switch them to thrown away meat too.|`|2zHq2XIMaa	Cassie, there are far more omnivores with anemia and nutritional deficiencies than vegetarians and vegans. It is a known fact that a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle is a lot healthier than a omnivorous, especially in todays world. Yes, humans have the ability to be omnivore's or vegetarians/vegans/pescetarians, but we do not put our selves at risk of "deficiencies" by improving our diets to include more plants and no flesh. For all I know, you could well be deficient in vitamin - I got a blood test the other week and I am perfect in every nutrient, as well as other parts of me: skins great, feel great, look great etc. <br>  <br>  It is also known that dogs can survive healthily on an omnivorous or vegetarian or vegan or raw vegan diet. Although, cats cannot survive a vegan diet. I don't particularly take to cats so I won't be getting one, but I hope to get a dog when I am older and I will be feeding it either a vegan or raw vegan diet. They thrive on that. I will always put my dogs HEALTH first. There are numerous restaurants which cater for doggie raw vegan diets. It's really great.<br>  <br>  I hope you can understand now? <br>  <br>  Oh and the animal companions I have had in the past have naturally been vegans - guinea pigs, rabbits, more rabbits.|`|AA11119758	There are vegetarian/vegan pet foods. However, even the makers of them don't recommend feeding cats a completely vegetarian diet as they are one of only 2 species that are obligate carnivores-the other is spiders.

4bedkpvLaa	Oven Fried Chicken II <br>  I love fried chicken, but it takes so long and is such a big mess. I came up with this one, and have been making it ever since! Everyone I have given the recipe to has loved it as well."<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS (Nutrition)<br>  12 chicken thighs <br>  3 eggs <br>  1 cup all-purpose flour <br>  1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs <br>  salt and pepper to taste <br>  1 teaspoon paprika <br>  1/2 cup vegetable oil <br>    <br>   <br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). <br>  Place flour in a shallow plate or bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Put the bread crumbs in another shallow plate or bowl and beat the eggs in another bowl. <br>  Dredge the chicken piece by piece in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs, until all pieces are coated. Pour the oil into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add the chicken to the dish and sprinkle with paprika to taste. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then turn pieces over and bake for another 30 minutes. Remove from oven and drain on paper towels. Enjoy! <br>  <br>  <br>  here are some other recipes I use sometimes<br>  <br>  Fried Chicken<br>  <br>  1 broiler/fryer chicken, cut into 8 pieces <br>  2 cups low fat buttermilk <br>  2 tablespoons kosher salt <br>  2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika <br>  2 teaspoons garlic powder <br>  1 teaspoon cayenne pepper <br>  Flour, for dredging <br>  Vegetable shortening, for frying <br>  Directions<br>  Place chicken pieces into a plastic container and cover with buttermilk. Cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. <br>  <br>  Melt enough shortening (over low heat) to come just 1/8-inch up the side of a 12-inch cast iron skillet or heavy fry pan. Once shortening liquefies raise heat to 325 degrees F. Do not allow oil to go over 325 degrees F. <br>  <br>  Drain chicken in a colander. Combine salt, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Liberally season chicken with this mixture. Dredge chicken in flour and shake off excess. <br>  <br>  Place chicken skin side down into the pan. Put thighs in the center, and breast and legs around the edge of the pan. The oil should come half way up the pan. Cook chicken until golden brown on each side, approximately 10 to 12 minutes per side. More importantly, the internal temperature should be right around 180 degrees. (Be careful to monitor shortening temperature every few minutes.) <br>  <br>  Drain chicken on a rack over a sheet pan. Don't drain by setting chicken directly on paper towels or brown paper bags. If you need to hold the chicken before serving, cover loosely with foil but avoid holding in a warm oven, especially if it's a gas oven.|`|RU2Yz6jEaa	you can buy a food thermometer.

Set aside and follow the instructions below for the method you choose.<br>  <br>  By hand: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the olive oil and yeast mixture into it. Stir until it begins to form a ball, then turn it out onto a clean, floured surface and knead for about 4 or 5 minutes. <br>  <br>  In a mixer: Using a dough hook, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Add the liquid ingredients and mix on low until the dough begins to clump around the dough hook. Remove and knead as above.<br>  <br>  In a dough-capable food processor:<br>  <br>  Use a plastic blade, if possible. Place the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of the food processor and mix briefly. Add the liquid ingredients slowly and process the mixture low and slow for about 2 or 3 minutes, just until the dough begins to form a ball. Remove and knead as above.<br>  <br>  In a bread machine: Set the machine for "dough" and follow the manufacturer's instructions; pick up the pizza dough recipe directions where the bread maker leaves off.<br>  __________________________<br>  <br>  <br>  Whichever method and pizza dough recipe you've chosen, your pizza dough should be a smooth, elastic ball. Lightly oil the ball and the inside of a large glass bowl. Place the dough in the bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled, about an hour. For better crust, punch down the dough, reshape into a ball and let it rise again. You can refrigerate or freeze the dough at this point.<br>  <br>  <br>  Divide the dough into 4 equal portions, about 6 ounces each. Roll each portion into a ball, then, working on a lightly floured surface, stretch the dough and work it with your fingers or a rolling pin to form an 8-inch circle. (Let your guests prepare their own.) The outer edge of the circle should be a little thicker than the body, forming a rim. Add toppings. <br>  <br>  <br>  Transfer to a pizza pan or pizza stone. Bake in a 500° pre-heated oven until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted, 10 to 13 minutes, or perhaps a little longer if your oven does not reach 500°. <br>  <br>  Pizza Sauce Recipes<br>  <br>  <br>  Alfredo Sauce<br>  This creamy white pizza sauce recipe has long been a favorite on pasta, but it's one of the best things to happen to pizza in a long time. <br>  <br>  1/4 cup butter<br>  3 cloves garlic, minced<br>  1 cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>  1/2 cup heavy cream<br>  Pinch of salt and pepper<br>  <br>  <br>  Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté for 2 or 3 minutes. Stir in the cheese, cream, salt and pepper and heat through, stirring constantly.

Try this one. Much more authentic than CTM.<br>  <br>  MEAT CURRY<br>  <br>  Serves 2<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  <br>  375g of beef, chicken breasts or lamb<br>  1 clove of garlic<br>  2cm (1 inch) piece of fresh ginger<br>  2 onions<br>  2 tablespoons of sunflower oil<br>  200g (? a 400g tin) of plum tomatoes*<br>  1 teaspoon of chilli powder<br>  1 tablespoon of garam masala<br>  ? a teaspoon of ground turmeric<br>  250ml of water<br>  <br>  METHOD<br>  <br>  Chop the meat into 1cm (? inch) pieces. Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the ginger and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the onions and chop them into tiny pieces.<br>  <br>  Put the oil into a saucepan on a moderate heat. Put the garlic, ginger, meat and onions into the pan. Cook for 20 minutes until the meat is cooked thoroughly. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. <br>  <br>  Open the tin of tomatoes. Pour the juice into a bowl. Chop the tomatoes while they are still in the can (it’s easier than chasing them around the bowl). Put the chopped tomatoes into the bowl. Use half and save the other half. <br>  <br>  Put the chopped tomatoes into the pan. Continue to cook, stirring as the mixture boils. Add the chilli, garam masala and turmeric, and stir. Add the water. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Put the lid on the saucepan and cook for 30 minutes. <br>  <br>  ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS<br>  <br>  The quantity of chilli powder above makes for a medium curry. For a hot one, increase this to 1? teaspoons.<br>  <br>  For a mild one, add 100ml (? a 200ml pot) of yoghurt 5 to 10 minutes before the end of cooking. For a mild Chicken Korma, also add a 50g sachet of creamed coconut. Add ? a teaspoon of mint sauce to the leftover yoghurt to make some mint raita. <br>  <br>  * Plum tomatoes can be used either whole or chopped. It is difficult to stick chopped tomatoes back together again if you need to use them whole.|`|3qa3BftUaa	Chicken tikka masala is my all time fave.

So with that in mind, I'm not only watching out for myself, but for my child not to get burned. Now, to keep from getting burned? I usually set whatever it is I'm cooking to be most closest to the oven door... Not far back inside the oven. No need to be reaching and stretching inside a hot oven. I have a few cooking gloves to which I place my entire hand(and partially my forearm)inside. Never once have I, nor my son been burned. I may feel a little heat to my face as heat rises when oven door opens, but that is about it.<br>  <br>  NOTE: do NOT get cooking glove/pad soaking wet, or for water to soak through any part of glove/pad... The heat WILL go right through the wet or soaked spots and WILL burn. Water IS a conductor of heat. Be careful. Otherwise, you will do just fine.|`|6SqxGQsqaa	you gotta do it, just reach in a pull it out. its that simple, i know its hot, but its all in your mind, your probably just scared of burning yourself. just be carefull and do what the first person said, put the cake pan on a cookie sheet for easier access. lol.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	try putting the cake on a cookie sheet , and when they are done take 2 dish rags to get the cookie sheet out, and put your elbow out from your sides|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Being burned and cut is just a sign of a good chef learning a skill.  I've been burned and cut many times and by many things.

Your rack in the oven should slide out as well.  Good luck and keep trying!|`|AA10466359	Get longer oven mitts. You could wear a long sleeve shirt.

The hippocampus is a component of the brain's limbic system that is crucial for learning, memory, and the integration of sensory experiences with emotions and motivations. Investigations have shown that neurons in the information processing system of the hippocampus and the activity of the nerve fibers in this region are suppressed by THC. In addition, researchers have discovered that learned behaviors, which depend on the hippocampus, also deteriorate via this mechanism.<br>  <br>  Recent research findings also indicate that long-term use of marijuana produces changes in the brain similar to those seen after long-term use of other major drugs of abuse.<br>  <br>  Effects of Marijuana on the Lungs<br>  <br>  Someone who smokes marijuana regularly may have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers. These individuals may have daily cough and phlegm, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, and more frequent chest colds. Continuing to smoke marijuana can lead to abnormal functioning of lung tissue injured or destroyed by marijuana smoke.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the THC content, the amount of tar inhaled by marijuana smokers and the level of carbon monoxide absorbed are three to five times greater than among tobacco smokers. This may be due to the marijuana users' inhaling more deeply and holding the smoke in the lungs and because marijuana smoke is unfiltered.<br>  <br>  Effects of Marijuana on Heart Rate and Blood Pressure<br>  <br>  Recent findings indicate that smoking marijuana while shooting up cocaine has the potential to cause severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure. In one study, experienced marijuana and cocaine users were given marijuana alone, cocaine alone, and then a combination of both. Each drug alone produced cardiovascular effects; when they were combined, the effects were greater and lasted longer. The heart rate of the subjects in the study increased 29 beats per minute with marijuana alone and 32 beats per minute with cocaine alone. When the drugs were given together, the heart rate increased by 49 beats per minute, and the increased rate persisted for a longer time. The drugs were given with the subjects sitting quietly. In normal circumstances, an individual may smoke marijuana and inject cocaine and then do something physically stressful that may significantly increase the risk of overloading the cardiovascular system.<br>  <br>  Effects of Heavy Marijuana Use on Learning and Social Behavior<br>  <br>  A study of college students has shown that critical skills related to attention, memory, and learning are impaired among people who use marijuana heavily, even after discontinuing its use for at least 24 hours. Researchers compared 65 "heavy users," who had smoked marijuana a median of 29 of the past 30 days, and 64 "light users," who had smoked a median of 1 of the past 30 days. After a closely monitored 19- to 24-hour period of abstinence from marijuana and other illicit drugs and alcohol, the undergraduates were given several standard tests measuring aspects of attention, memory, and learning. Compared to the light users, heavy marijuana users made more errors and had more difficulty sustaining attention, shifting attention to meet the demands of changes in the environment, and in registering, processing, and using information. These findings suggest that the greater impairment among heavy users is likely due to an alteration of brain activity produced by marijuana.<br>  <br>  Longitudinal research on marijuana use among young people below college age indicates those who used marijuana have lower achievement than the non-users, more acceptance of deviant behavior, more delinquent behavior and aggression, greater rebelliousness, poorer relationships with parents, and more associations with delinquent and drug-using friends.<br>  <br>  Research also shows more anger and more regressive behavior (thumb sucking, temper tantrums) in toddlers whose parents use marijuana than among the toddlers of non-using parents.<br>  <br>  Effects of Marijuana on Pregnancy<br>  <br>  Any drug of abuse can affect a mother's health during pregnancy, making it a time when expectant mothers should take special care of themselves. Drugs of abuse may interfere with proper nutrition and rest, which can affect good functioning of the immune system. Some studies have found that babies born to mothers who used marijuana during pregnancy were smaller than those born to mothers who did not use the drug. In general, smaller babies are more likely to develop health problems.<br>  <br>  A nursing mother who uses marijuana passes some of the THC to the baby in her breast milk. Research indicates that the use of marijuana by a mother during the first month of breast-feeding can impair the infant's motor development (control of muscle movement).<br>  <br>  Addictive Potential of Marijuana<br>  <br>  A drug is addicting if it causes compulsive, often uncontrollable drug craving, seeking, and use, even in|`|52Ay4rUwaa	no not poisonous. <br>   unless one of your friends or whoever sells it to you is trying to be an asshole and puts rat poisoning in it. it has happened to over 700,000 people in the US alone. they think its funny when it messes up all kinds of internal problems.<br>  <br>   other then that your fine. if you take 5 hits you'll be stoned. you'll probebly pass out after you eat, but its normal. just make sure you keep water next to your bed cause youll wake up really thursty.<br>  <br>  Orange Kush is better, its based on opinion though. <br>   they are 2 different kinds of highs. but really if you do smoke weed for a while you'll see the differences from smoking kb = really good weed or shwag = somewhat like midgrade. lower class weed.<br>   shwag makes you think harder and is alot cheaper. <br>  <br>  dont let people rip you off. they do that with first time smokers.<br>  <br>   a gram of weed is 20.00 some sell for 25.00 when they are being greedy.<br>  <br>  a gram of shwag is 5.00 so dont let people switch them and confuse you because you will be able to see the difference between kb and shwag.<br>  <br>   hope this helps|`|UwFc9ZEYaa	anything you burn and inhale is toxic...including cigs.

AE3lv4pRaa	spaghetti bolognese recipe:-<br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients:-<br>  <br>    Serves 1 increase ingredients again per person<br>  <br>      - Half pound (227g) Free Range and or Organic Beef mince not too lean<br>      - Half an onion finely chopped<br>      - 1 Carrot Finely Chopped<br>      - 1 tin chopped tomatoes<br>      - 2 tablespoons sundried tomato puree<br>      - 1-2 cloves of garlic sliced<br>      - One glass dry good red wine such as a bordeaux or burgundy<br>      - 1 Bay Leaf<br>      - Finely grated Fresh Parmesan cheese<br>      - Salt and Black Pepper<br>      - Olive Oil<br>      - 4 fresh basil leaves<br>      - Cup of Beef Stock<br>  <br>  <br>  Method:-<br>  <br>  Free range beef will always give the biggest flavour improvement over mass produced beef, organic if you can. Don't use extra lean mince as the fat in this as with many dishes is the medium which carries the flavour. Take two frying pans and start cooking in parallel, in one add the olive oil and start cooking the onions, garlic and carrot slowly until translucent. The carrot is a recently new ingredient to this dish for me, I recently had to cook this for a person with an onion allergy so I substituted carrot entirely for onion becuase carrot is a wonderful flavouring vegetable for stews and stocks and the result was very good so now it is a standard addition. In the other pan turn the heat up very high ( the best pan for this is a cast iron pan ) we are going to sear the mince in small batches. This is an important process, a bit like searing meat for a casserole, the exterior of the mince is to be caramelised (or burnt a little) because later it is to be slow cooked on the hob which will break down this crust and create sublime slightly sweet browning to your pasta sauce. Now sear the mince on the high heat in small batches, season on all sides with salt and pepper, stir until cooked on all sides. Transfer to a plate or bowl when cooked. When the onions are cooked, add the wine, stock, tomato puree, tomatoes, bay leaf and mince. The beef stock will ideally be proper home made from beef bones but that is not always practical so a cup of stock made from bouillon beef stock or a good stock cube will be ok. You should only be getting 1 or two bubbles in the sauce if you have more turn it down. Simmer for 2 hours, 1 will do if you are in a hurry. Add the fresh basil finely chopped or broken for the last 10 minutes and remove the bay leaf. The slow cooking brings out all the flavours of the meat and breaks down the acidity of the tomatoes. When ready cook the spaghetti as per packet instructions. Serve the pasta and sprinkle over half the parmesan directly on the pasta then serve the spaghetti sauce and top with more parmesan!|`|seLkY8VZaa	Here, I found this one...<br>  <br>  <br>  Spaghetti Bolognese For One Ingredients<br>  100 grams of lean minced beef  1 pinch of dried basil<br>  1 small onion  1 Pinch of sugar<br>  1 medium clove(s) of garlic  2 tablespoons of red wine<br>  1 Small tin (200g) of chopped tomatoes 1 pinch of dried oregano<br>  2 teaspoons tomato puree<br>  Instructions for Spaghetti Bolognese For One<br>  Place the minced beef in a large pan and cook over a medium heat until browned right through.

BYm9KzQvaa	Unrefined rock salt, more or less as mined, is used for industrial purposes or de-icing roads.<br>  Food grade Rock Salt is normal edible salt, allowed to crystallise into little lumps, more like find pebbles than rocks, really. (They are squarish in shape, not rounded, because of the natural shape of slat crystals). As a mineral, it never "goes off", but it can become contaminated. <br>  <br>  A lot of moisture would melt them, then as they dry out they'd clump into lumps.  Lesser moisture would just soften them enough to pick up whatever contamination that moisture had in it. (Try this with spraying a saucer of the salt with water that's had red food colour added: when it dries out again you end up with pinkish rock salt). If the cup's been sitting there open, it's probably acquired a bit of dust. Never mind, this will burn off in the baking process. <br>  <br>  Pretzels make a great base for rock salt. So would a foccaccia, a kind of bank pizza drizzled with olive oil when it's nearly cooked,  the salt sprinkled into the oil to hold it, and returned to the oven for another 2 minutes.|`|FxWppY7Baa	As long as it does not get wet, rock salt should last at least a hundred thousand years. It is a mineral, not a food, so it cannot rot/go bad.|`|6GULDLO1aa	Ummm Rock Salt is not edibile rock salt is used for deicing or snow melting on roads. However if your talking about sea salt which im sure is the case it does not go bad.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	Rock Salt is good until it get wet  it can last for ever

AA11469249	Try using baking powder as well (about a teaspoon) - also use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Reduce the temperature of the oven. try not baking it for so long.<br>  <br>  Apart from that there isn't much you can do. Different flours give different results at different times. depends on the air temperature I think.<br>  <br>  Baking bread is an art form you know - takes a skill not many have.|`|xNEhI9XOaa	There is too much oil in this recipe.  I use the same amount of oil as sugar (15g or less for a normal sized loaf).<br>  <br>  Keep the yeast separate from the liquid (put the water in first, the yeast in last).  Also there is no need to heat the water.  The machine does all this for you.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I emailed you, so check it out.  I need more space than what is here to help you.  I will help you, I can help you.  I love making bread.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	Try this one <br>  2 cups flour <br>  2 1/2 teaspoon soda <br>  3 tablespoon crisco <br>  1 teaspoon salt <br>  4 teaspoon sugar <br>  1 pack of yeast <br>  1 cup warm water <br>  <br>  Dissolve yeast in warm water with 1 teaspoon of sugar <br>  Then add to other ingredients. <br>  put in breadmaker .|`|6SqxGQsqaa	without changing your original recipe i suggest not kneading the dough so much. also let the dough rest in a well oiled bowl and cover it tightly.|`|d5ec0db90372775006f3c771bed01617aa	First of all, sugar is only used to "activate" the yeast, and usually 1 to 2 teaspoons should be more than enough: 25 gr. is way too much. You don't say what program you used. As far as I know (I am a bread machine newbee too) the chewy/heavy bread sometimes happens when one uses the "Quick" or "Rapid" program. Try a program that has a long proving time (your bread machine manual has all the information you need).<br>  Water: when it is too warm (and it seems to me that it could be the case) the yeast is "stunned" :)). If the yeast you use is the powdered type (not the fresh variety that comes in blocks) use water at room temperature, you don't need to warm it as the machine will do it for you. Different story if you use the block, you need to use some water taken from the amount given in the recipe, warm it slightly and make a paste with the yeast and the sugar (and then chuck everything in the machine AWAY from the salt (very important: salt stops the yeast growing). <br>  Last but not least: what flour are you using? According to its "strenght" the loaf will be well risen or not. Wholegrain flour needs a certain amount of another "stronger" flour in order to have a fluffier loaf. Manitoba flour is very good (strong) to obtain fluffier and lighter loaves.<br>  Hope it helps!|`|e8f93ed049722cba2266153f0aedc1abaa	Thats way way too much sugar - try about 9g instead - if you put too much sugar in, it will affect how the yeast works and thats maybe why it was a bit chewy.<br>  <br>  You will have to probably play around with the amounts as different flours need slightly different amounts of liquids and sugar etc.
s7TaxmIGaa	I looked up the recipe and read the reviews ... many others had the same problem but it was fixed by simply kneading in more confectioners sugar till the right consistency and it worked out fine  . also since you  used butter it gets more watery when worked and tends to break down more easily  than  shortening but it will sure taste better,... if you can get it to hold up ..  another idea is to put it in the refrigerator for a few minutes after  kneading in more sugar , then it should roll out fine|`|AA10466359	You were only to use the shortening to grease your hands and work area.

oMmBhWK4aa	Chinese New Year is also known as Lunar New Year as the Chinese traditionally use the lunar calendar. The celebration is from the 1st to the 15th day of the first lunar month (these dates vary yearly on the Western Gregorian calendar). In China, Lunar New Year is known as the Spring Festival or Chun Jie. It symbolises reunion and a fresh start in one's life, similar to how spring brings new growth in nature. Being largely agricultural in the past, Chinese people spend the whole year working on farms and hence relished the new year as a time to socialise and celebrate family relationships. For the less well-off, it was also the only time in the year they had a chance to wear new clothes and eat delicacies, including meat.<br>  <br>  There are many different customs and beliefs associated with this festival, some are unique to particular locations or Chinese dialect groups. Some are based on superstitions, while others are ancient traditions.<br>  <br>  Some common important ones are:<br>  - Spring cleaning before the Lunar New Year. Any sweeping done during the New Year is considered inauspicious, seen as sweeping away good fortune.<br>  - Reunion dinner on the eve, considered the most important meal of the year due to the Chinese emphasis on family unity. The only absentees are married daughters who will eat with their husband's family.<br>  - The giving of red packets or hong bao (containing money) by married people, to children and unmarried adults for good luck. These days there's more flexibility in this custom. For example working singles may also give to kids and their parents.<br>  - Dragon and lion dances. The dragon in Chinese folklore controls the rain, hence the wish by farmers for a year ahead of rain. The lion dance is believed to ward off evil and bring good luck. At the same time there was lighting of firecrackers to frighten off evil spirits, but firecrackers are banned in some places due to risk of injury & fire.<br>  - Lunar New Year visitations: On the 1st day of the new year, people will wear their new clothes and visit relatives to bring them good wishes. The 2nd day onwards is usually for friends and staying at home to receive guests. But there's no hard & fast rule.<br>  - Decorations: Plenty of red colors as red symbolises good luck for Chinese. There are very intricate paper cuttings on red paper done by Northern Chinese women. Spring couplets are 2 pieces of calligraphy of 4 Chinese characters each, both couplets have to match the other in content & related meaning. ***** willows & cherry blossoms are traditionally used flowers.<br>  <br>  Food plays a major part of the Lunar New Year and is full of symbolism for the occasion:<br>  - 2 mandarin oranges are brought along on visitations. The guest gives the host the oranges and the host returns the same number. In the Cantonese dialect, mandarin orange sounds like gold, so it's a good fortune gesture.<br>  - New year cake or nian gao is a sticky sweet confection to symbolise a yearly increase in status. It is also used as an offering to make the Kitchen God say only good things in his annual report on the household to the Jade Emperor.<br>  - Fish symbolises wish for surplus every year<br>  - A common meal for reunion dinners is the hotpot or huo guo due to ease of preparation and wide variety of ingredients. Different regions have their own versions.<br>  - Dumplings are very traditional in China, especially Northern China with their "jiao zi" dumplings in soup and "guo tie" pan-fried dumplings. The dumplings are made to look like ancient gold ingots for good fortune. Some have the tradition of hiding a coin in one dumpling to denote good luck for that one person, rather like for traditional Christmas puddings. <br>  - In South East Asia, particularly Singapore, one unique dish is "yu sheng" or raw fish salad. Raw or smoked fish, lots of shredded veggies & various sweet sauces and other seasonings are tossed high with chopsticks to the accompaniment of auspicious sayings.<br>  <br>  There are many many more customs & types of food involved, this is just a sample. For recipes, you could search the internet for things like nian gao, dumplings, tang yuan or sweet glutinous rice flour dumplings, snacks like pineapple tarts etc. Hope you get a good grade!|`|rgPmkqwXaa	ermmm, Chinese New Year is exactly what it says: New Year, but since they don't have the same calendar as the Western world, theirs falls on a different date.....|`|eolsn2e2aa	<a href="http://www.c-c-c.org/chineseculture/festival/newyear/newyear.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.c-c-c.org/chineseculture/fest...</a><br>  scroll down a little.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New...</a>|`|dcZcPtIoaa	New Year for the Chinese?!<br>  <br>  An animal is usually celebrated yearly!<br>  rat, dragon, monkey, goat, dog, cat, etc......

I am from Baltimore and a cosmo cost $5, but if you are at a bar, it will cost more. Or you can go to the liquor store and buy the ingredients and make your own at home, it's cheaper!!|`|M0RyKbwbaa	I'm not sure the usual price, but everything is a bit more pricey in San Francisco.|`|6SqxGQsqaa	if you were at a club or hotel then that price is about normal, and if they used premium or super premium liquor to make your cosmo then thats why it was so much, if they used well liquor then it would have been a little cheaper.

ubhpDXoYaa	yes there is.<br>  The nutritional value of capsicums lies in their vitamin content. <br>  Vitamins A, C and E are present in sweet and hot chilli peppers, <br>  the sweet having particularly large amounts. <br>  As a matter of fact, 1 ounce of raw sweet pepper contains <br>  approximately 40 mg of Vitamin C, which is two thirds <br>  of the recommended daily intake of that vitamin. <br>  <br>  However, chilli peppers and sweet peppers lose their vitamin content <br>  when they are cooked or pickled, or if they are allowed to ripen too much. <br>  Scientists say that chillis add more than just flavour to the diet. <br>  Capsaicin stimulates the appetite, helps to clear the lungs, <br>  improves circulation and acts as a painkiller for rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. <br>  Capsaicin, once ingested, causes the brain to release endorphins into the <br>  bloodstream which can induce a natural feeling of well being similar to that <br>  achieved by long distance runners. If you ever wondered why long distance <br>  runners seem to enjoy running, just eat a few nice hot chillis and experience the feeling for yourself !!!<br>  <br>  Search it for you!!<br>  hope i helped!<br>  anyway there's a link for more info.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chillifarm.com/chilli_info/nutritional_value.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.chillifarm.com/chilli_info/nu...</a>|`|MIx1fSbdaa	According to a study, it has 'strong antioxidant activity' (aka, helps fight free radicals, which cause DNA damage and other damage leading to aging and cancer).

In Mexico, the jalape?o is also known as the cuaresme?o and gordo. Until recently, chipotles were almost exclusively found in the markets of central and southern Mexico. As Mexican food became more popular in the United States in the late 20th century and into the 21st century, jalape?o production and processing began to move into Northern Mexico and the United States.|`|Bx7F9jscaa	It's a chile.|`|GuJ5NGmdaa	name of a great mexican restaurant but i believe its a mexican dish or pepper. :)|`|8th9KY1haa	It is a hot chili pepper or jalapeno that has been dried (used in Mexican cooking)<br>  You can get it in a spice bottle at the super market. use it very sparingley,it is extremely hot.|`|GelbRB8qaa	hot chilli pepper or jalapeno that has been dried (used in Mexican cooking)|`|ieS2q7Gcaa	smoked jalapenos, i believe its spanish

You can make the color darker by waiting longer after you add the extra curry powder to the hot oil. Just don't let the mixture burn. Using gound allspice instead of whole will also give it more of the East African flavor you are looking for.<br>  Also... I do not use the vinegar and I use more than the suggested amount of curry powder. It's up to you.<br>  <br>  3 lb.

Vinegar <br>  <br>  6 Pimento Seeds (Allspice) <br>  <br>  Method: <br>  <br>  Wash goat meat with vinegar and water. Rub in all the season with goat meat and let it sit in the refrigerator for 1 hour. <br>  <br>  Remove the meat from the refrigerator and then remove the seasoning from the goat meat. <br>  <br>  In a saucepan, heat the oil on high until it smells. Add 1 oz. curry powder to the hot oil. Stir curry powder in oil until the color starts to change. <br>  <br>  Put the goat meat in the saucepan now. Stir the meat in the hot oil for two minutes; be careful not to burn the meat. <br>  <br>  Add 1 oz. water to the pot, keep stirring until the meat looks like the muscles are tightening up. <br>  <br>  Now turn down the heat to medium and add 2 cups of water to the meat in the saucepan. Cover the pot and let this stew simmer for 20 minutes. Check on the meat in the pot, stir again and add water to cover the meat. <br>  <br>  Simmer for another 20 minutes, and then check to see if the meat is medium soft. <br>  <br>  If it is so, add the seasoning you removed earlier to the pot. Let the stew simmer for another 15 minutes on a slightly lower heat (between medium and low). <br>  <br>  (Optional) You can add potatoes to the pot the same time you add the seasoning. You can also add bread crumbs to thicken. <br>  <br>  Note : Although this is a stew, it should not be dominated by watery type gravy. You should make this stew cook until most of the water is evaporated, and let the fat from the goat flavor the stew.

Therefore, high protein vegetables need to be combined with other protein supplements to fulfill the complete share of proteins and vegetables. Such a protein supplement is primarily essential for those who are generally vegetarians and have to depend upon low calorie and low fat diets. For instance, if you eat plant protein in form of vegetable curry along with rice or bread then the required amount of protein is surely accessible.<br>  <br>  The importance of high protein vegetables lies in the fact that often the amino acid content of low protein vegetables cannot properly be utilized for growth or maintenance of tissues. Therefore, during such cases the vegetable protein is either burnt as fuel or stored as body fat.<br>  <br>  It was often believed that high protein vegetables or high protein diets are extremely beneficial for humans and especially for the athletes. This is far from the truth. High proteins can never make a good diet. It is true that protein is an essential nutrient and it has a major role to play in making our body function properly. However, this does not mean that we require protein in huge proportions. In addition to this, protein supplements are in most cases costly, needless and even injurious for some. <br>  <br>  According to a general survey, the Vegan diets of the Americans are low in protein content in comparison to standard American diets. However, it has already been mentioned that it is not at all a credit to have high protein diets and at times, such a diet may give way to osteoporosis 4 and kidney diseases. <br>  <br>  Some examples of high protein vegetables include a varied quantity of beans, grains, nuts and seeds. Remember, protein contains essential amino acids, often referred to as building blocks of the body. In reality, our body is in need of amino acid and not protein. We need twenty different varieties of amino acids of which our body cannot produce nine out of the entire variety. Therefore, under such circumstances the amino acid content of the protein rich vegetables are absolutely essential for our body. <br>  <br>  Soybeans, quinoa (a grain), and spinach are some examples of high protein vegetables. However, not all protein rich vegetables have all essential amino acids. For instance, grains have low Lysine content and legumes have low Methionine content in comparison to other vegetables having considerable protein content. <br>  <br>  The basic idea is to combine low protein contents with the high ones for the exact availability of amino acid content. Such a way of procuring high protein vegetables and diets is indeed rational but the process is entirely complex and fairly complicated. <br>  <br>  Your daily requirement of high protein vegetables is:<br>  <br>  One cup of cooked soybeans (29 gms of protein), lentils (18 gms of protein), black beans (15 gms of protein), kidney beans (13 gms of protein), chickpeas (12 gms of protein), veggie baked beans (12 gms of protein), pinto beans (12 gms of protein), black-eyed peas (11 gms of protein), peas (9 gms of protein), spinach (5 gms of protein) and broccoli (4 gms of protein) should all be eaten <br>   <br>  <br>  Four ounces tofu (11 gms of protein) and firm (11 gms of protein) should be eaten <br>  1/4cups sunflower seeds (4 gms protein) are necessary for you diet. <br>  Therefore, if you are a vegan, it is not enough for you to include only one essential protein item in your diet. The source has to be varied and correct in matters of amino acid content.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Everything except oils. <br>  <br>  Really. <br>  <br>  Protein is the building block of cells, so when you eat something that has cellular walls holding it together, you are eating protein. In addition to meats, dairy, and eggs, this also means that all plants contain protein.|`|vDawNdPzaa	Everything but fruit contains protein.  Don't listen to these meat-heads they are biased in completely the wrong direction.  Your body has a "pool" of amino acids (the compounds that make up proteins) where it stores them until they have the right proportions to make the right protein.  Your body only needs to take in 8 amino acids, and it can make the rest.  Meat weighs down on your digestive tract and makes it work harder than it needs to.  If you want to learn about each food's nutritional content check out a site like www.nutritiondata.com.  You can look up certain foods, or enter all of what you ate for one day and see if you are getting enough of each nutrient.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|4bedkpvLaa	When to Eat and How Often <br>  This might sound strange, but you have to eat more often to lose fat and gain muscle. During my transition period, I never ate less than 6 meals a day. <br>  ? Try to eat every 2 to 3 hours. <br>  ? Do not eat complex carbohydrates after 6:00 p.m. or four to five hours before going to bed. <br>  ? Try to eat one gram of protein per pound of lean body mass on lifting days and .8 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass on non-lifting days. <br>  ? Never eat more than 70 grams of protein in one meal.<br>  Carbohydrates <br>  When I think of carbohydrates, I think of energy. Carbohydrates supply our bodies with the energy it needs to make it through a workout. Without an adequate supply of carbohydrates, the body goes into carbohydrate deprivation. This is called a state of ketosis (meaning our body is using protein as energy). This is not a good state to be in for long because it will rob the body of muscle tissue in an effort to create energy. On the other hand, if too many carbohydrates are consumed, they convert into stored fat. The idea is to consume just enough carbohydrates to make it through our workouts with sufficient energy. I have broken down carbohydrates into these three categories: <br>  ? Simple carbs: These are sugars, or quick energy. They are absorbed very quickly into the body. Ex. Anything with sugar, also fruit <br>  ? Complex carbs: This is where you get long-term energy for the day. These are long chained carbohydrates that brake down slower, giving us energy over a prolonged period of time. Ex. Oatmeal, potatoes, pasta, rice, breads <br>  ? Fibrous carbs: These are things like vegetables. I think of them as roughage in order to stay regular. Make sure you include them in you later meals when you can't eat complex carbs. They are also a good source of vitamins. Ex. Leafy vegetables like lettuce.<br>  Protein <br>  Proteins are the building blocks of our muscles. Without a sufficient amount of protein in our diet, our muscles will not have the raw materials that they need to build up, or even hang on to what is already there. <br>  Net protein utilization: Not all protein is created equal. Different foods are absorbed more than others. For example, egg white protein is absorbed at 88%. That means we get about 9 eggs to our muscles. On the other hand, chicken breast are absorbed at 68%, meaning we get about 7 breasts to our muscles. It is imported to eat a wide verity of protein foods though; no one protein source has all the amino acids we need. <br>  ? Whey protein (100%): the best source of whey protein is from protein supplements. It is also absorbed very fast by the body, so it is best to take this when your body needs amino acids quickly: like right after a workout or when you first get up in the morning. <br>  ? Egg whites (88%) <br>  ? Fish (78%) <br>  ? Chicken breast (78%) <br>  ? Soy protein: My one bit of advice would be to try and stay away from soy protein. It is not absorbed very well by the body. <br>  Fats <br>  We normally think of fats as being bad. The fact is certain fats are essential to building muscle and carrying out various functions of the body. There are 2 fat types we need to be concerned about: <br>  ? Saturated fats: these are the bad fats. Avoid these fats as much as possible. You will find these types of fats mostly in meats <br>  ? Unsaturated fats: these are the good fats. They are a good energy source and help us build muscle. You can find from plant oils. Peanuts are also a good source. <br>  Water <br>  Do not under estimate the importance of water! If you are looking to get lean, water will be your best friend. Drink as much as you can and as often as you can. Also, it is very important to drink lots of water when you're eating large amounts of protein to clean urea from the system. <br>  Vitamins & minerals <br>  As resistance training athletes, we have a greater need for vitamins & minerals. When we workout and bring blood to our muscles it is important that our blood is full of those essential vitamins & minerals if we want to grow. <br>  Supplements <br>  Supplements are just that, meaning they are used to supplement your diet, not replace it. Don't ever think of it that way. <br>  Hierarchy of supplements:<br>  I developed this hierarchy of supplements based on what I thought were the most important and also by price. <br>  ? 1. Proper diet: Without proper diet you are just wasting money on supplements. Start here! Do not think that supplements are going to do it for you alone. <br>  ? 2. Multi-vitamin & mineral: It is very important to have all your vitamins & minerals when resistance training. Most of us are lacking in some areas, make it a priority to make this your first supplement. <br>  ? 3. Protein powder: It is usually very hard to get all the protein you need from real foods. Powders make it much easier. Also, these powders are absorbed fast by the body making them ideal after workouts or before and after sleep. <br>  ? 4. Creatine: This is great for harder workouts. It also makes you muscles hang on to water, giving them a better env|`|llkSmgLJaa	Unless your starving yourself, or eating just junk food, your getting enough protein. <br>  <br>  The Protein Myth<br>  Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine<br>  <a href="http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/protein.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/prote...</a>|`|QMP6V0QKaa	food items containing proteins are dry fruits,milk and milk products eg  paneer,cheese,curds,cow milk channa,khoa,whole milk powder.pulses and legumes are good source of protiens.if u are non vegeterian then meat and poultry products are good sources.

This is the zest and is quite rich in aromatic essences. Be careful not to get any of the white pith of the peel since it is very bitter. Squeeze the oranges and strain the juice well. In a mixing jar place the orange juice, zest, vodka and the corriander seed. Cover and leave to infuse for two weeks. Drain thru a coarse sieve and return to the mixing jar. Discard the residue. Add the brandy flavor and the sugar. Shake vigorously until the sugar is dissolved. Leave to clear. This liqueur is very slow to clear, so be patient. When clear, two weeks or more, decant and add brown food dye previously mixed with a small amount of the liqueur. This liqueur should be a pale brown color so go very easy with the brown food coloring, lest you end up with a dark brown liqueur.<br>  <br>  -----------AND...<br>  <br>  Grand Marnier<br>  <br>  TO MAKE 1 QUART<br>  <br>  3 tbsp essence of orange<br>  1/2 cup white sugar<br>  1/2 cup water<br>  1/2 cup honey<br>  1 cognac, for the balance<br>    <br>  Grand Marnier Directions<br>  In a saucepan, boil the sugar and the water until it makes a heavy<br>  syrup.

Puesto que el hecho de que aún comiendo permanezcas flaco/a no significa que no te esté haciendo efecto, después terminarás con una diabetes. Mejor, te aconsejo que vayas a un nutricionistas y te dejes de comer porquería, debes tener un metabolismo óptimo. Ve ya a un médico porque te podes hacer un mal muy grande. Tal vez el médico te salga con alguna otra cuestión que es la responsable de que no puedas subir de peso.

3c1ed1b246bf3b39bcf07dfd2e29dba4aa	I prefer aluminium cookware.  The thicker the pan, the better the heat dispersion, which reduces the chance of "hot spots" occurring. Remember, since an aluminium pan is all aluminium, heat spreads evenly over the total surface, including the side walls. Traditional stainless steel pans spread heat evenly only on the copper or aluminium base.
CzaHanhxaa	If your in the south you can try going to Publix grocery stores, I know they have them both there. If you live up north you might try Kroger or Meiers (sp). But to tell the truth anything further out than the midwest and I can't give you specific store names to go to but follow this idea...if the store is one of the more upsecale grocery stores more often than not it will have those hard to find items!
