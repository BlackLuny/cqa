So far, I've seen a 12 box set (English Dubbed) movies. I'm planning on buying this instead of buying the DVD's individually, but I have no idea whether the 12 box set's English is the same as the originals. Yea, I know it says "English Dubbed" but I just wanted to make sure it sounds like the original, individually English Dubbed movies.

20080704134302AALDPWT	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What was the name of that one animated/cartoon movie...?	It was sort of a well-animated cartoon. I remember it airing sometime at 2006/2007, and it was about this one boy that had a passion for skating, but he had some sort of acciddent by getting beat by a skateboard by some teenagers that were brainwashed(or something of the sort). He then had to spend his life in a wheelchair. His parents were ambushed by the same brainwashed skateboarders by chasing after the parents (that were in a car) in skateboards. Anyway, the boy then turns into some sort of hawk themed superhero who's only weapon is his skateboarding skills. The movie was rated PG-13, and was only on a kid's channel once because some girl kept on trying to seduce the handicapped superhero hawk.    Any help with the name of the movie will be appreciated.

Did anyone happen to watch yesterday when Rocco Dispirito and Karina Smirnoff were being interviewed after their dance?

She seemed to have been trying to change her persona the last few years, but that just showed me that she's the same angry person she always was.  I feel bad for Rocco because he seems so nice and he has to work with her.  Just wondering if anyone else caught it.

20081026015052AAJHeLI	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	To have what you have not, and to give what is not yours to give?	Think for a moment of someone who means everything to you, who is the most important person in your life that you care about.      *Proceed once you pick that person*      Now separately think about something you always wanted, it matters not how unreal the desire or dream. You can have anything you ever wanted or could possibly imagine.      *Proceed only after you thought what it is*      Now let us collide those worlds, and make a exchange. List who is most important to you, and then what you desire most. And tell everyone who reads this, if you will exchange their life for your desire.      This is test of where your heart is, could you sacrifice one person if it meant creating a cure for cancer? Or could it be you sacrificed that person so you may live forever. What ever you decide, think carefully.

20081102003810AAgcJjP	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Tell me what you think of this joke. I know it's long, but it's really funny!?	A blonde, a brunette and a redhead are sitting on top of a 30-storey building that's being constructed. It's their lunch break.      The redhead opens his lunchbox and says "Gee, if I ever have pizza for lunch again, I'm going to jump to my death off this building.      The brunette opens his lunchbox and says "Gee, if I ever have burritos for lunch again, I'm going to jump to my death off this building.      Then the blonde opens his lunchbox and says "Gee, if I ever have chicken foccacia for lunch again, I'm going to jump to my death off this building.      The next day, they are up at the same construction floor and having their lunch.      The redhead opens his lunchbox that day. "Oh no. I have pizza for the billionth time. Goodbye, cruel world. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"      The brunette opens his lunchbox that day. "Oh no. I have burritos for the billionth time. Goodbye, cruel world. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"      The blonde opens his lunchbox that day. "Oh no. I have chicken foccacia for the billionth time. Goodbye, cruel world. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"      At the redhead's funeral, they ask his wife why she packed him a pizza and she said she didn't like him that much, so she was sent to jail.      At the brunette's funeral, they ask his wife why she packed him burritos and she said she didn't like him that much, so she was sent to jail.      At the blonde's funeral, they ask his wife why she packed him a chicken foccacia and she said "Don't blame me you retards. My husband packs his own lunch."

20081101174201AAR62UF	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you think this is right?	Okay, I'm just really confused at the moment. I know this is long, but I don't know what to do.      So on Friday (Halloween) I got my exam results back from a test I did two weeks ago. The exam said that I got top marks-everything was right. Then the next day I answered this question about an amniocentesis. It was pretty misleading from how I was marked.       So I researched it and I found out that I got it wrong, but the question was marked correct.      I have until the 7th of November to submit an examination appeal to the head of department. I don't know if I should. I mean, usually people only go there if they don't like their mark and they think it's wrong. But I like my mark and this is the first time I ever got 100% on any test.      But I know it's wrong, but should it be corrected? So if they do look at the record, it will backfire on the school, won't it? Or would it be worse for me?      I'm not sure whether to take it to the head of department or not. What would you do if you were me?      Sorry about the category, but I can actually get answers here.
20081024023622AA9uZFv	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	In the Back to the Future trilogy, do you think Steven Spielberg liked Dolorians?	I was just wondering this because you know how the time machine is designed in the shape of a Dolorian, well it's the main point of the story, so you would think Steven Spielberg would like them.      On the other hand, the Doc wanted to destroy the thing, so do you think he wanted them all to go "KA-BOOM!"      I think he would've liked them because of the styling because that's what the Doc says in the first one: "Well, if I was going to build something completely high-tech then why not do it with style?"      Oh and by the way, which movie in the trilogy is your favourite and why? I kinda like the 2nd one because it had so many ties with the first one and the 3rd one could've been written a lot better (just e-mail me for the details because if I listed them here it would take longer than it already has).

I chuck you to our own star!   But a catapult cant be that free   Don't go cry to me.      _[Chorus]_   Don’t escape from torture cause it'll hurt yah!   I'm gonna know I'll put your hands in a meat grinder!   Tu ce scimio bruto   Et retardissimo   But now it’s time to go   Time to go to hell   When I put you on a spit-roast.   Or knock you on a church bell.   Cause you're done for now.   God damn it don't have a cow.      I'll shoot you and you're gone   You got mad when I sprayed pepper-spray in your face.   That is why I had to spike you with a mace.   You were on the floor.   But my eyes hurt more.      [Chorus]      I've tortured you enough.   I have realised that you cannot resist.   My torture and what I had done like this:   I stabbed you to death.   You took your last breath.      [Chorus]      Don't have a cow.

I admit I have felt there is a special link between a Taurus and a Scorpio as friends but there is something weird, which makes me feel not myself anymore, I behave with this person in a way which I normally do not, I feel awkward. I believe something was not ethical in the way he relates to me and not honest enough so I just literally would like to forget about him and stop thinking, I want to be free. I am feeling obsessed with thoughts and I am hurting myself. Please give me tips which would be the best to forget and move on, he with his life, I wish him all the best and me with mine. It's no one's fault, just we are too unable to be adequate to each other and it causes pain. For me that friendship proved it was an error and I honestly would like to delete the error.
20081110103637AAbG89X	Entertainment & Music;Movies	This is a shot in the dark, but I am trying to remember this movie I saw as a kid. If I had to guess it would ?	be from the mid to late 80's. I was thinking George Wendt, Norm from Cheers, was in it. I do not think so after research, though. Maybe it was someone who looks like him. I remember very little. I think the Wendt looking guy was the neighbor to these kids. They somehow find a portal to a strange universe. I think there were dinosaurs initially. I know there was a CRYSTAL SKULL involved. This is probably the best hint I have. The kids had this skull and there were people trying to get it back I believe. I know this is a vague description. This has been driving me absolutely crazy and any help would be greatly appreciated.

When he read the statement he became very furious and ordered his men to find the person out and punish him.    And in no time, the culprit was tracked down and brought to the Judge.  An advocate was also allowed to defend him. (It was democratic country after all!).    After a long trial, the crap was found guilty and was sentenced.  A fine was imposed and incarceration for 30 years.    The Defence Counsel was unhappy.  He pleaded that one cannot be punished twice for a single crime.  But the Judge said no the person has committed two crimes.  The monetary penalty was for defacing the wall of the Presidential House.  And the sentence for incarceration was for divulging a national secret.    What was the secret?

20081110084754AAjV8aW	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Two joeks i thought were funny, what do you think? :)?	Presents for the wife.   Three men, a doctor, a lawyer, and a biker were sitting in a bar talking over a few drinks.      After a sip of his Martini, the doctor said, "You know, tomorrow is my anniversary. I bought my wife a diamond ring and a new Mercedes. I figure if she doesn't like the diamond ring, then at least she will like the Mercedes, and she will know that I love her."      After finishing his scotch, the lawyer said, "Well, on my last anniversary, I bought my wife a string of pearls and a trip to the Bahamas. I figured if she didn't like the pearls, then at least she would have enjoyed the trip, and she would have known that I loved her."      The biker then took a big swig from his beer, and said, "Yeah, well for my anniversary, I got my old lady a t-shirt and a vibrator. I figured if she didn't like the t-shirt, then she could go f*** herself."                   eye exam.   A guy goes to his eye doctor for an examination. They start talking as the doctor is examing his eyes. In the middle of their conversation, the doctor casually says, "You need to stop masturbating."       The guy replies, "Why Doc? Am I going blind?"       The doctor says, "No, but you're upsetting the other patients in the waiting room."

And then I feel like kind of a brat when I ask for money from my parents to get a pair of jeans or something because I already have a few pairs of shorts. And it seems like I didn't really do anything to deserve it, either.

I saw a movie preview today before the Transformers movie it didn't have a title only a date for sometime in January. It shows people having a going away party for a guy going to Japan. Suddenly there's a loud roar and the lights go out. They go to the roof and look towards the city, then the roar happens again and an explosion takes out some buildings. They all run to the street and look in the direction of the fire, suddenly a car hits a nearby building and almost hits the people then the roar again. Screen goes black and release date shows. I'm thinking it might be a new Godzilla movie but it never gave a title so I'm stumped.

It tells a fictional story of a teenage journalist writing for Rolling Stone magazine while covering the rock band Stillwater, and his efforts to get his first cover story published. The film is semi-autobiographical, as Crowe himself was a teenage writer for Rolling Stone.   Despite receiving good reviews, the film was a box office bomb. It received four Oscar nominations, one of which led to an award to Crowe for his screenplay.

But on the other hand I feel that a lot of people might be overreacting just a little bit, it's just feel that Kurt has been gone for about 15-16 years & he was the biggest musician out of the 90's so I think that it has been long enough to the point that we can create a movie on his life.

20090130180411AAJEzg2	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Who agrees with me that a crossover of Superman and Goku would be the ultimate?	I mean, Superman is viewed by most people as the most powerful comic book character, while Goku has been voted the most powerful manga character. Not only that but fans and organizations are also crediting Goku as the Japanese equivalent of Superman. One reason is that the two have a lot of similarities (super strength/speed, home planets destroyed, one of the last few survivors of their kind, and both dying and being resurrected). Don't you think that words couldn't describe how awsome it would be if Jerry Siegel and Akira Toriyama worked on a story together to bring the two characters together? But guess what, as much as I hate to say it that'll never happen; why, because while Toriyama is alive and well, Siegel has already met his bitter end. But that's not the point. I'm just wondering how many of you people think the same thing as me?

I'm more of a low singer than a high singer though lol. I have mostly just stuck to country because I live in a small hick town and thats pretty much all I know. Should I stay with country? Or go for something else? And if so, what? Also, do you have any songs that are in my voice range? Also, I have heard that American Idol happens in Salt Lake City, Utah around July, but I don't know when exactly or what I have to do. Does anyone know?

Seeing as if you go back to the times of first creation and you stick a chicken in the middle of no where, the chicken can survive and go on making babies and so forth.    If you put an egg in the middle of no where it won't have a chicken butt to sit on it and it'll freeze up and die, therefore incapable of growing up into a chicken and making more eggs.    What's your theory?
