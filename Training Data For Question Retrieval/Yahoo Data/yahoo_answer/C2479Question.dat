20090307030155AAN51Et	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	The poetry section has gone wierd, so i'll ask here. what do you think of my poem? i'm 13?	Angels   The chorus of laughs that chime through space,   An angel kiss of lavender breath.   Daffodil hair over cloaks of lace,   And long silver arms that cradle our death.      The echo of a sigh that drapes the sun,   In waterfalls of empyrean silk.   Meadows of flowers, the warmth that begun,   In a golden cloud of sunflower's ilk.      Spinning on her toes that hail the sky,   To fall and rise in a shower of songs.   With a push from earth, into heaven they fly,   The angel of our tears, in heaven she belongs.      Your laugh that cracked into a billion stars,   That fed the white feathers of your guardian's wings.   Shimmering waves of what was ours,   Satin clothes from the night she sings.      To tread the air like a lake of water,   To turn and drink the cascading light.   She plunges through as freedom's daughter,   The battle that does not dwell upon a fight.

20090307024558AAVRSqW	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Could this be a foreshadowing outlook to our future as a country?	People love speculation. Whether it comes in the form of a sign reading "Dead End," right before you go into work and find out you have lost your job or a bright, colorful rainbow you happen to catch a glimpse of before you go into work and discover you have just been promoted.   With our nation in the midst of an economical crisis, all we can do is sit back, watch, and pray for a miracle. I had to look no further than Yahoo's homepage to find mine today. "Eagle Survives Crash Through Truck Windshield." Talk about symbolism, how much more do you need? Our national bird (representing the United States) crashing through a windshield (representing our economic meltdown) and it manages to survive. I do not speculate often, but that one caught my attention. You do not even have to read the article in order to draw the symbolic connection to our country in the hard times we are faced with today. I look at it this way, if an eagle can survive smashing through a windshield, I see no reason why the nation it represents cannot rise above this economic slump and pull through all the turmoil it has left us in today.   I know it seem like a long-winded, overly optimistic outlook, but I think it is a sign. We have not hit the windshield yet, but when we do, our nation will be ready. Our nation will stand tall. We will pull together! We will prevail! America will survive!   My question to you is, what do you make of this: just another story or a ray of hope? Please feel free to share your honest opinion. The story has been posted below.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/odd_eagle_tru...

Empty dreams splayed out on the sidewalk   kicked up into tiny little crystals   by children playing in the shadow of the sun,   wisps on a kick of wind    the die is cast down on the street corner raising up,   the expectancy of the child,    the youth, unaware of earth's cruel aims, jumping,   skipping to the upbeat of    the wafting saxophonist notes from the windowsill   crisp and clean as air, ha,    well clean as it can be, the smoke stacks from    the tomato cannery cast   forth a sweet red smell, if red was a scent    it would be found in the cans of tomatoes   and wilting sun-dried roses    whole roses with thorns of life and pains of birth,   and have you ever just   walked outside to see the summer sun rise over   all the little square houses   sweet and utopic and that rough American stand-   still, a portrait if there ever   was one, little red plastic wagons lolling in driveways   and the mailman making his rounds--"Hey mailman   what you got in that blue bag for me?"--he smiles   an' spits an' han's   me a letter crisp and dazzingly blinding in the white   shine of the rising sun on the sizziling parchment,   the mailman walks on, always walking on, and on...   and on, making his   majestic rounds a dutiful citizen serving his spoke    in the rusted wheel of the state, just being his role,   a cherubic white-collared fool, screaming inside   at the routine tired    and at a wit's end, scrambling before falling again,   and burning again in the vast inferno of industry,   making his rounds those rounds, and that   protocol, that terrible protocol,   say "yes sah" "no sah" "paehaps sah"   perhaps he's just mad, mad at the life he leads   the world striding forward fat and proud   bulging with commerce while the wells run dry.

20090307044216AABuL3j	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is This a good idea for a book ? please read :D?	this is a book i'd like to write anyway i love magic and everything   please read it i'm sorry to waste your time but read it and see if itis good or not give me your comment       this is what is gonna happen in the book      is this book good ? theres the question right there so its not chatting (;      okay   Anyway there are four nations the Earth nations the Water nations the fire nations and the  air nations  anyway all of the nations used to be in peace with one another, and all of them where in balance because of the sacred cynolian crystal it was said to be sent by the goddess Onedia it was the  source of all the nations magic then one day an evil but powerful  man from the fire nation wanted the cynolian stones powerful magic for himself so he stole the crystal and he used the magic for himself and made himself ruler of the world he called himself the combustion lord but he was cruel and evil and everyone called him the dark flame. All the elements tried to put there power together to steal the cynolian crystal and kill the dark flame so peace could be restored. But the dark flame was too powerful and he split the nations into 4 and then all the 4 elements started blaming each other for the horrible fate that had become of the world       Here’s a little something about the magic of the 4 elements …   Well the people in the air nation could take control over the air around them so basically they can fly and glide and blow really powerful they called this air coination. the water nation can freeze the water and they can hold there breath under water for hours and they can control the current this was water coination, the fire nation can breath fire and they can make fire come out of there hands and feet and they cant get burned this was fire coination, the earth nation can control the earth around them such as mud, sand, rock ground, soil and very few realised that when you mastered the earth magic you can coinate the metal and everything that was apart of the earth. After hundreds of years 500 to be precise Onedia sent down the four Light spirits. Evangeline of the earth nation, Glacious of the water nation, Colion of the fire nation and Zarno of the air nation they were not born they were found in a cradle with the birth marks of a lioness on Evangeline, whale on Glacious, dragon on Colion and a griffin on zarno anyway they were found by the monks of there elements which were very religious and knew why they were sent because Onedia told the monks in a dream. She told them “soon my good followers I will send down the four light spirits They are in each nation one will come to you however they will come in human form and you must raise them to be masters of coination and when they are ready they will be able to transform into there birth mark and then all the light spirits will fight together to save the world. You must not tell them they are light spirits until they are 15 years of age. Then they will be ready. We see Evangeline’s point of view and we see how she copes meeting the rest of the nations which no one had in 500 years.

20090307043524AAkjPoU	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Inspired by the late, great Bill Hicks (and some drinking). Please review and critique this work.?	Virus   “I’m tired of this back-slapping “Isn’t humanity neat?” bullshit.    We’re a virus with shoes, okay? That’s all we are.”    Bill Hicks, Rant in E Minor      Evolution, time’s blessing and curse,   Some millennia spent and some millennia forged   A world perfect, wondrous, and diverse.   Until there arose beings engorged   By their surroundings. Somewhat perverse   These oddities, existence became worse.      Shun these creatures, never satiated,   Desiring all, save the divergent few.   Horders, harvesters, creatures procreated   Done in fashion too quick for nature to subdue.

I think I may have a feeling what they mean, but I tend to always be wrong about that stuff.      1. Macbeth: "I have almost forgot the taste of fears, the time has been, my stress would have cool'd. To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair would at dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors; Direness cannot once start me."      2. Macbeth: "I am in blood, stepp'd in so far, that, should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o'er." *I have a feeling this one means that he's gone so far now into the 'dark side' that returning to the good side would be just as hard as going to the dark side.*      3. Macbeth: "I dare do all that may become a man; who dares do more, is none."      4. Macbeth: "I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o'erlaps itself and falls on the other."

So far, I know that I want the plot to be a murder mystery plot set on the infamous RMS Titanic during the maiden voyage and the sinking. It would be good because they would be racing for time to find the killer as the ship sinks around them and evidence vanishes under the waves. I would like some advice and tips from anyone who answers this question. And tell me if it sounds like agood plot. Also, just a thought, but maybe it would be good if I made it that the killer holds a gun to the officers head and forces him to crash it into an iceberg, in order to escape in all the confusion.

20090307014350AA0w9pb	Arts & Humanities;History	Information on Propagana Art in Australia?	In my Australian History class,we are currently deciding on topic for our Individual History Essays.      My teacher explained to us that the students who achieve the best results usually pick topics that they are genuinely interested in. So he suggested that we make a list of our interests, and see how we could relate any of them to Australian History.       I think I've decided to focus on Australian art, as art is a passion of mine. I've now been trying to research and figure out how to make this into a narrower topic.       I'm interested in perhaps looking at propaganda art in Australia and the impact it had during wars, etc.      I'm going to talk to my teacher again next lesson and find out what he thinks about this topic, but for now I'm trying to read up on it as much as I can. The only problem is, I am finding it very hard to find information online about propaganda art in Australia.       Does anyone know where I can find any information? Thanks.

20090227131642AAzh3jk	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is it easy to follow what is happening in this piece?	This is the beginning of a play. Tell me how you think it could improve, which parts you liked best, etc. Does it create suspense of what is being discussed?   Thanks :)      Setting: The Abbot stands in front of a table. Three aristocratic figures sit around the table facing him. It is dark. Candlesticks are aglow, white drapes are drawn behind the table. Shadows are cast on the walls.         Abbot      It is no doubt a frosty night to call upon you so   Late as it is, my noble friends.   Forgive this man whose beard comes whiter each day   Whose memory fails and falters.   Had I known a better choice, or livelier alternative   I would have died a thousand times   Turning and then burning   Than summon you here on a cold November Eve.      Yet every setting sun is but one occasion lost   A slipping chance from our unclenching fists.   How regretful!   And if conduct can be crime then so   Some acts undone are well-committed crimes   And not to act is enough treason   To incur the holy wrath.      So, let me call for your attention   Undivided and complete   As I divulge my troubles recent   Which pain my heart and tear   Me.      PAUSE      Senior A      Many troubles, Father Abbot   Have moved us to grieve, of recent   The poor are chained with heavier fetters   Of which even wild beasts are free   And the rich do not sleep soundly   Any longer, but nightmares of revolution   Rattle them in their sleep.      Senior B      True. True. Difficult times.   One cannot help but wonder   In these sweet words the poet speaks   "What troubled storms and icy winds   This Our Lady of December brings?"      A MELANCHOLIC FLURRY OF NODS   SENIOR C GETS TO HIS FEET      Senior C      When the coffers are empty, My Lords   And the spiders spin their webs   In the nooks of what were   Olden palaces, gilded stairs   And crystal chandeliers   ‘Tis then we can truly grieve.      Senior A      What do you imply?      Senior C      Let us not shed tears of fear   But lift a finger!   Are we not the pride of Salamanca?   We, skilled wizards, have   Done wonders before   Time and again   Day in and day out!   Our smiles cultivated fields   Our scowls shook the earth!   If heaven disfavours us today   Then let us act with   What little favour   She has thrown our way!      ALL BANGING ON THE TABLE (IN AGREEMENT) SENIOR C RETURNS TO HIS SEAT      Abbot      I am glad I witness this   Sure sign of fortitude   Which my noble friend expresses   In so fine a language.      Gladder, that I find us all agreed   On the course we are to take   To challenge the crises   That threaten to shake   The very foundations   Of our ancient institutions.

Straightway the rebels fell down   To the abysmal, fiery lands   Where in despair they did drown   ‘Til raised by defiant commands.      Now they sit and plot revenge   ‘Gainst His newest of creations,   And for their shattered dreams they will avenge,   And seek their own emancipations.

20090307050813AA4YVw8	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing a comparison essay on Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe, and Cry, The Beloved Country, Alan Paton.?	I've only read Cry, The Beloved Country because our teacher wanted our partners, with the other novel, to give us the details about it. I realized how difficult this was so I hired a tutor for one time & tried getting the other novel but failed.   My tutor advised me to compare Reconciliation between father and son because it was evident in both novels; however my tutor has not read the book in ages. After writing the first few paragraphs, I realized I've got nothing to write about for "Things Falls Apart" where else compared to "Cry, The Beloved Country" there's plenty to write about.    Note I'm also not very good at literature and this is all due on Tuesday.   So bottom line is what do I do? Is reconciliation as evident in "Things Fall Apart" as my tutor said so? Because sparknotes and the internet did not say much about reconciliation.

Within the confines of this room tonight   Upon this bed that’s made for me and you   With only moon and stars to give us light   The room takes on a sultry sateen hue   We here together feels to me just right   The way you look at me with eyes of blue      Within your arms the warmth embraces me   And as our limbs become entwined in lust   The waves roll o’er me as the turbid sea   Amor, to you my patchwork heart entrust   The fire now a flame of ecstasy   I come undone as ashes fade to dust      When said and done our memories will tell   Though years have passed they lent their kindness well

20090307071606AA4HO96	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A poem called Whispers......................…	Whispers      Lil one…    In my arms,   You talk to me   Of all past harms.   You whisper you’re sorry,   Forgiveness you ask,   “Take all my sins   Please, Father, and cast…”   You then go on to tell me,   What you’ve done in a day,   Whispering in great detail…   Everything, you did say…    You tell me of some people,   Some that are dear to you.   You pray for you’re loved ones,   And those that are new..   You tell me all your troubles,   Worries and fears,   You ask that I help you,   And stay by you near..   I hold you tighter,   And place peace on your mind,   I don’t forsake my children,   Never leave them behind..   You close your eyes softly,   And ask me for strength,   You make me smile,   As you ask me for faith..   Dear child, I’ll be there,   When life gets to rough.   I’ll be your pillar of strength,   And hold you in my love..   Some days will be harder,   And you won’t see me anywhere…   You may think I’ve forsaken,   But I’ll always be there…   Tears begin to fall,   As you ask, “what if I fail…   What if I can’t do it…”   But child, I will prevail.   Two pairs of footprints,   Yours and mine..   But when you see only one pair,   I’ve carried you, that’s why…   You then begin to drift,   There in my arms,   You stretch slightly,   And then wake in alarm,   Your eyes turn solemn,   And your face downcast,   “I’m sorry, dear Lord,   I’m tired and don’t think I’ll last…”   You looked so sad,   There against my chest,   I couldn’t help but smile   And whisper ‘Just Rest…’   Lil one… my child…   You’ve crawled onto my lap,   I’ve hugged you to my bosom,   And in my warmth you’ve wrapped…   My child, I love you,   Rest easy in my grace..   To fall asleep in whispers,   There is no better way…      ~end

20090307071720AAEIlD9	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A Poem I wrote: Thoughts?	[Title] Our Song (This Pleasant Dream)      Ah, this pleasant dream   How softly do her eyes reflect the moonlight   Me, I wander here   She draws me near   As shadows listen      I would run my fingers through her hair   And let the darkness fade away   She would breathe a sigh of sound contentment   While a tune of simple silence plays   Ah yes, t'is sweet indeed   This moment, pleasant be      My song, so dear to me   With words of all her tender love ascending   My song, and if my heart   Should beat with yours in time, could it be   Singing your song too      These are memories   That never die    They never grow old      Strolling through the meadow on an early summer morning   I'd pluck you a rose   Skating on a frozen pond while slipping and collapsing   Into piles of snow   And when the night came 'round   I heard a sweeter sound      My song, we'd sing the darkened hours away   While gazing up at all the stars on high   We'd turn to look into each other's eyes   A kiss between us   Wow, your song      Ah, this pleasant dream   Was once not good, I can remember      Sailors looked upon a clouded night   While navigating stormy seas   Calling to Polaris or the mighty winds to calm   And guide them home again   While I held to the mast   While waves were tossing me      My song came down from heaven's cellestial sea   And dried the rain drops from my battered face   The thunder roared   Now, hark can you hear   Two hearts are beating   Our song      I love her so much   Her gentle touch means everything to my heart   Do you want to know what makes my dreams true   She loves me too

Since we read a different version, there was a little parts skipped, like when you see Hamlet holding the skull and reciting his soliloquy. So when does he say that?

20090307064014AAhfYZw	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Care to review my East of Eden essay? (10 points!)?	Any help appreciated!   ---------      Is violence ever appropriate? This question is presented in East of Eden, as well as life itself. When Charles violently attacks Adam, mimicking the story of Cain and Abel, one immediately assumes that through the rest of the book, Charles represents evil, and Adam represents good. However, when analyzing the event and both Charles and Adams background and their relationship, Charles actions become less maliciously. When examined the conclusion can be drawn that Charles should have never hurt his own brother so viciously, his motives are apprehensible.      One night, when trying to persuade Adam to join the army, and all its benefits, his father is posed the question “Why don’t you ask my brother?...He’ll be much better than I am.” (27). Cyprus replies that the army can not offer anything Charles does not already have, and will release a part of him that “needs to be chained down” (27). In addition, Cyprus reveals “I love you better. Always have” (28). Later that night, after supper, Charles questions Adam on what their father said. Adam, not wanting to upset his brother, says they only talked about the army. Charles, however, realizes what happened. Charles argues that he loves his father more than Adam, working hard to get him a pocket knife for his birthday. Cyprus never used it, but enjoyed Adam’s present, a free stray dog. Charles, in rage, attacks his brother until Adam loses conscious. This jealous event is based of the story of Cain and Abel. God chooses Abel for his animal offerings over Cain, similar to Cyprus choosing the puppy as his favorite gift. In Genesis, Cain proceeds to kill his brother in anger, and God’s punishment is to send him to “East of Eden”. While Charles does not manage to kill his brother, all though he attempts to, the two stories are greatly entwined.       A sequence of events drove Charles to beat up his brother; he didn’t attack him on impulse. Growing up, Charles was always boisterous and athletic. Being the stronger brother, he protected his older brother from schoolchildren, “Charles fought any boy who challenged or slurred him” (20), and he also managed to protect his brother from their father. When Charles lost to his brother in a game of pee wee when they were younger, he was visible upset. Charles was proud of his physical strength, because it was the only thing Adam didn’t have. It is able to understand Charles actions now. He never asked to be his brother’s keeper, but constantly took care of his brother. When he is not rewarded with praise and love from his father, all he ever wanted, his life came shattering down. Charles did what came easily to him, although it was immoral.      Adam grew up under different circumstances. Having never met his mother, he was unsure of himself. The constant pressure from his father to join the army forced him to retreat into his own world, “he covered his eyes with a veil of vagueness” (20). Unlike Charles, Adam was a silent and withdrawn boy. When it came to his brother, “Adam was glad of Charles like a woman is glad of a fat diamond…but love, affection, empathy were beyond conception” (21). Neither brother relied on each other for the right reason. Charles was a body-guard, and nothing more to Adam, while Adam was a foil, to serve as a weak contrast to him. While neither brother fully appreciated the other, their tension is released on that night in a way everyone can identify with, even if it was not right.      Was Charles actions that night simply an outrage from a violent, oppressed boy, or are they justified? Through understanding Adam and Charles’s history, a more precise verdict can be drawn. Both brothers had an estranged connection, they never actually could confide in each other.  While Charles is seemingly fallowing in Cain’s footsteps, there is one difference between Steinbeck’s novel and the story of Cain and Abel; Charles admits remorse. While this doesn’t make the crime any more heinous, this shows that he knew he acted wrong. Charles’s actions, while not appropriate, are understandable.

20090307072221AAxr4ke	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Sometimes My Body Leaves Me - poetry analysis?	One of the poems I'm dealing with for my poetry seminar is       Sometimes My Body Leaves Me   by Lorna Crozier      Sometimes my body leaves me,   goes into another room   and locks the door. There      it bangs about   like an angry thief.   What is it looking for?      Then there are its silences   stretched thin and taut   between us, invisible      as a fishing line   falling through layers    and layers of green.      I don't know what it feels,   if it feels anything;   or what it remembers,   if each cell holds a memory.      I don't know what sounds to make   to call it back.      What does it do when it sits alone    without a book or anything   resembling love?      It would be amazinggg if anybody could just tell me what this poem is talking about, and kind of paraphrase it for me. I'm not really understanding what point the author is trying to make in this poem. My friends and I thought it was about body image but our teacher said no, so we don't know what it is!! Thanks in advance :)

I don't want to put too much and boor you ;) But I would appreciate it if you could let me know what you think? Be honest, but nice!!       Balion pulled at the fabric of his jacket, trying with little success to shut out the wind which rattled through the village of Chal, giving the rain a ferocity of life which was unusual to the sheltered community of stout wooden homes and shops. Seeing his destination just a short way off, Balion decided giving up on his hopeless task and leaned into the wind as he made his way onwards.    “You sure they will still be at Jerry’s?” called Balion over the wind.   Michal Runskin, the village rouge, entrepreneur, and all around mischievous trouble maker, looked across at his friend with one of his rare serious expressions.   “If he’s still alive, who’s knows what could have happened since I left!”   The two young men had been on the road since early the previous morning, taking turns at jogging whilst walking at a brisk pace had gained them a good half day, but their was still the likely possibility that they could be too late.   Balion had been at home by himself when Michal had turned up, flustered and weary from already having spent the previous day at a run to seek out help. The blond headed young man explained to his friend that an incident had occurred at the village, leaving one man dead and another seriously wounded. He had been sent, he said, by Cecil the Herbman, who said that the mans life was in the balance and his only chance was if Julian could make it to him in time.   Julian (Balion’s grandfather) had a never ending store of knowledge, both magical and mundane, and was well respected among the villagers for his astute observations and clinical methods. Whatever the problem, whether it be the wasting sickness or simple bouts of sickness, the old man would have at least an idea of what could be done to help. Julian’s idea’s were as good as fact to the villagers.   “What do you mean he’s not here!” Michal had shouted, “Where’s he gone? And what about that man? We can’t just leave him to die! Your gifted, isn’t there anything you can do?”     And that was why Balion was now battling through wind and rain to the Inn of the Clucking Hen, to see if there was anything he could do. He had a pretty good idea of what it was he could do, he just wasn’t sure if it would work on a man. He had only practised on animals before, and not all the times was he successful.   When they reached the Inn, Michal pushed forwards and the door swung open, roasted meats and ale assorted their senses with a pleasant sample of warmth, Balion realised that he was seriously hungry.   Inside the room sat a half dozen men and a like amount of women. The men sat talking in hushed tones, while the women were throwing furtive glances at the man who stood at the bar. Balion recognised a number of the women to be both unwedded and wearing their best dresses, whoever the man was he seemed to have captured their attention.   Seeing Balion the room went quite, the men gave him brief nods of welcome from grim countenances, while the women gave him shy smiles.   “That’s the mans brother, the one I told you about.” Said Michal with an indication of his hand to the man standing at the bar. “Come, lets see if the fellow still lives.”   Broad shoulders and a face of sharp angles, the man stood and turned to the two young men as they made their way forwards.   “Xzen, this is Balion, Julian’s grandson.” Supplied Michal to the surprisingly calm stranger. The man eyed Balion appraisingly, his gaze stopping on the silver ring that adorned his right hand.   “Where is Julian?” asked Xzen in a heavily accented Kingstounge.   Balion twisted the ring self-consciously, “He’s not here.”

20090307064937AA93Hvr	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can anyone help with a search for a poem about a blackbird singing from a bough?	At school back in the 50's my then headmistress gave me a poem to read as she thought, rightly, that I would enjoy it.  I think she thought of it as I loved nature.  All I have of that poem is a visual memory of a garden and through the garden gate into an orchard with trees covered in blossom and a blackbird singing from a bough.      I've been searching on and off for years and every time I hear a blackbird sing it sends me off on another fruitless search, can anyone help please?

20090307070732AAgvg2l	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does anyone know any books like...?	The Outsiders. When I ask for books like this, I kind of want the whole "they need to stick together" thing. I've read The Greenies by Myra Paperny, and that is great! It's about Jewish Orphan Refugees who meet each other and become friends on the boat to Canada, and then the Canadians aren't exactly friendly at first, so they all stick together. Even though the Canadians do become more friendly, they still stick together because they just understand each other. So basically I like stories like that. Does anyone know any good ones?

20090307075502AAmUVu6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please give me your opinion on my story!! thanks?	It's a fictional journal of a girl named Jessica Ditzler. thank you for your opinion! (btw, I don't appreciate people saying they don't like my stuff just because the main character is homeschooled or is a Christian, just tell me what you think of the writing, and what I could do to make it better)   ok, here it is:       Jan. 1, 2009      I got this diary from my parents on Christmas, and I waited until the start of the new year to start it. I'm gonna try to keep writing in here all year, though I don't know how well I'm gonna do on it. I haven't been very good at journals and diaries in the past. OK, first things first. I'm 12 years old, I live in Duluth, Minnesota. I have elbow length SUPER thick brown hair. I have an older brother, Peter (he's 21 and in college), a younger sister, Rachel (she's 8) and a dog, Pal. I'm homeschooled. I'm a nerd. What else is there that I should put down? Well, I have 2 (I know, nerdy, i mean, i have 2 friends?!) friends. One, I've known all  my life and her name is Julie and she's 13. The other I've known since I was 7, and her name is Joyce and she's 13, too. That seems like all there is about me.                    Jan. 2    Hi...Oh, another thing I forgot to say about me is that I go to Fredenburg Community Chapel for church. This morning I was doing the dishes (we don't have a dishwasher, it stinks), and Rachel was just sitting and "practicing for my drawing class", as she says. She has a drawing class starting in the middle of FEBRUARY. Not in a few days, or even a  few weeks. like a month & a half away! Uggh, but that's not as bad as her excitement about camp. She gets to go to camp for the first time this year, and in December she made a packing list. And she made it on her white board, so she wouldn't lose the paper that she wrote it on. Since then, she's re-written the list 3 times (since it's gotten smudged up by her going over it with her finger atleast two times a day), and drawn what the inside of her backpack will look like. I mean, she drew  every single shirt, pair of shorts, scrunchie, etc. Ya, she's weird. Aren't all little kids that age weird?!? Well...sounds like mom wants me to go do the dishes. Seeya!

Is it due to error, incompetence, or a more sinister motivation? Explain.      2.Of the whole range of feelings possible to man (joy, anger, embarrassment, excitement, etc.), why is fear the prevalent emotion in this society?      3.Equality understands that his invention will benefit mankind greatly (the light bulb); however, this was not his main motivation in conducting his experiments, and it is not the primary source of the great joy he experiences. Discuss      4. Equality questions the morality of  his former society. Contrast what he was previously taught about solitude, good, evil and joy, as to what he believes now.
