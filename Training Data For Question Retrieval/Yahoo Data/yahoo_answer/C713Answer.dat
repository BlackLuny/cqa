AKjCqX1oaa	DONT DO IT! AH. Take it from your semi-ish friend like thing, Don't. You'll disappoint me. and others around you. You also may not be able to kick it because it's a physical addiction not a mental addiction and the addiction can be painful too. It doesn't deepen your voice either. That's a myth. Seriously do some research and you'll find out that's true. It can damage your voice and your lungs but it's not deepening it.|`|L6kgSHqvaa	Even if you THINK you have no trouble kicking the habit, you'll make up excuses to keep smoking and eventually you'll end up a 40 year old man lugging around an iron lung.    Plus, girls will NOT be attracted to you. You will smell like crap (breath, etc) and just be generally disgusting.|`|uDIVz3NPaa	Never take up smoking.  It'll do you no good.

I did for a year, and then went cold turkey, it's been more than half a year now and i want a cig every time i see one. your voice fits you. dont change it.

Dont do it.|`|bWXm4fKEaa	NO DO  NOT DO THAT!!  you will become addicted to it and might never kick the habit. and who knows u might get lung cancer or die    answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|Zp0pQBeTaa	don't even start. you'll be smoking for the rest of your life. what a stupid thing to consider.|`|WE8PMnPcaa	ok ok this better be the best answer...  put a sock in it do not SMOKE~!!!     your voice will be deep but u wont have a voice in time ~!!  be smart   take a voice lesson ~!!!|`|58eR09Mwaa	DO NOT smoke....thats just a stupid question. its a bad idea and a horrible habit to break.|`|UXf6g6Sjaa	Contact the trained professionals at this URL:-  www.philipmorrisusa.com  I am sure that they will give you a free, honest, and unbiassed opinion.|`|KCJEkgByaa	smoking doesnt help anything|`|WRXNoZPRaa	NO!! its VERY harmful to the body....lots of people die from smoking everyday at young ages....VERY BAD TO START!   dont do it......it will give u many health issues u have to deal with in the future...waste of money..and u'll have to spend LOTS of time at the hospital in the future ...|`|aG20ruqYaa	NEVER EVER SMOKE!!! bsides how old r u? if ur like in ur teens just wait ur voice will deepen.|`|da2893b5bf5a97ea93277afbac2121fdaa	If you, like Morrissey, are hoping for an early death.|`|QZZY8g59aa	i wouldnt take up smoking cause it makes u feel crappy and lazy|`|JVkXml3paa	haha smoking is not as easy to give up as working out and chocolate.  but idk, if you're up for it...|`|rwVvBMN8aa	really dont. its extremly unattractive and it might change your voice in a way you dont want it to(raspy voice) .  it smells disgusting, costs a lot of money, and is unhealthy.    i stress that it is REEEAAAAALLLLY unattractive|`|vJYesZ5Zaa	NO! smoking doesnt help. it just makes your voice scratchy.. ehem!! smokers voice/cough.. all the same hun.. dont take it up.. ever!|`|hVUgtpO3aa	Um, no.  I smoked for years and quitting was the best thing I ever did.    Smoking will likely cause a sore throat as well.    I believe it's also the leading cause of preventable death.|`|V5jB8B70aa	No way bro, waste of money for one thing, it just isnt worth it, sure you might get a deep voice but you will get disgusting teeth, breath which is much worse than not having a deep voice|`|2OssbWjfaa	yes your addictions.... those are not addictions. try marijuana, even tho it is more of a controlled drug compared to others ppl seem to still get addicted to it. remeber this, cigarettes are the same as weed in the sense that you do them for the same reason. i quit weed for 5 months so far and was on it for 5 years and i have more trouble trying to quit cigarettes when ive smoked them for 6 years, you make the decision for yourself. but my advice for you is to practice vocal exercises and you will change your voice... thats not a good reason to get cancer

t3H4yklUaa	Lemme get this straight. Your girl is due in two weeks, and you're sketched, right?    Honey sports have nothing to do with rasing kids.     First: Go to a bookstore and find books on child rearing and father/child relationships.    Second: Debate asking this girl to marry you. Do you want to marry her? Do you even like her that much?     Third: Depending on your answer to the second question set, either ask her to marry you, or go see a lawyer to get custody and visitation arranged. You need something legal in place to protect yourself and her, and the child.    Fourth: raising kids is a learn by doing thing. Be involved with your child and you'll get a lot out of it.    Good luck!|`|nJuexFXLaa	talk to ur mom|`|ph9OmfBwaa	maby you should get a job and ask you mom if she can help you out for about a month|`|DKyW18YXaa	Patience is the key to being a good father.

If I were you, I'd take the next 2 weeks to think about your father, and everything you loved about him, and everything you wished he had done differently, and find a middle ground some where in there and strive to be that.

Quand tu penses que tu n'as pas de chance  quand tu n'as pas ce que tu veux, tu ne l'auras probablement pas..  Si tu crois en toi, probablement, t?t ou tard, tu l'auras.  Souviens-toi toujours des compliments que tu re?ois.  Oublie les remarques mchantes.    Dis toujours aux gens ce que tu ressens ? propos d'eux,  tu te sentiras mieux quand ils le sauront.  Personne ne mrite tes larmes et tes pleurs,  et celui qui le mrite vraiment ne te fera jamais pleurer.    Si tu as un(e) meilleur(e) ami(e), prends le temps de lui dire  ce qu'il reprsente pour toi.    Envoies cette lettre ? tous les gens que tu apprcies,  incluant la personne qui te l'a envoye.    Si tu le fais, tu illumineras le jour de quelqu'un et peut-tre  changeras-tu sa perspective de la vie, pour le meilleur.    On dit que cela prend qu'une minute pour remarquer  une personne spciale, une heure pour l'apprcier,  un jour pour l'aimer, mais qu'on a ensuite besoin de  toute une vie pour oublier.    Envoie cette pense aux personnes que tu n'oublieras jamais.  C'est un petit message qui leur permettra de savoir  que jamais tu ne les oublieras.  Si tu ne le renvoies pas ou ne l'envoies ? personne cela signifie  que tu es bien press(e) et que tu as oubli tes amis(es).  Arrte-toi un peu et prends le temps de vivre !  Alors ? Qu'est ce que tu attends?  Envoie-le ? toutes ces personnes qui sont si importantes dans ta vie..      Ce soir ? minuit ton vrai amour va raliser qu'il t'aime.|`|c6JHHGc4aa	rptez SVP

ph9OmfBwaa	just cuddle with me and hold me tight and just sit there|`|VSCJdGGTaa	let everyone know that im his and no one elses like come up and kiss me by suprise while im talkin to my friends
bPUkGdL8aa	Depends on the guy.     Some guys are bood men and they notice a nice rack first.    Some guys are pretty face guys and notice the face first.    Some guys are butt men and check that out first.    Personally im a butt man. a nice butt is the first thing i notice.    Who cares about the face, you can't tell what she looks like in the dark.  A coke bottle body is more important.|`|11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	face. everyone knows that.|`|AA11909745	Her face|`|32gWq7Pvaa	Her face, what else would make her hot?|`|CykmtyDOaa	Me. I like the clothes. Nice tight shorts and a nice tight shirts. And when they turn their back toward me I like to gander at their perfect asses! Well, you can't expect not to get a perverted answer when you direct a question like this for guys only.|`|QPZ5eXE8aa	Face, if she has a beautiful face, then I am already attracted to her.|`|oXUIp1K3aa	Depends on the angle.    Face and especially eyes first.  Da Bootie is next tho.|`|2smgUPwYaa	what is "hot" id say prolly eyes maybe hairdo|`|1d8jFXsjaa	Legs and ***... straight up.... that is what I am first attracted to... every guy has different opinions though... but just place major emphasis on your *** and legs... work em out by running and eating right and such... and have good hair and ****, I'm sure you'll pull in a dude.|`|UzNDWRD6aa	ya her face, but if shes not hot then nothin just keep lookin on|`|wVxAHc1Raa	well, it depends on the guy. Some guys look directly at her chest because they are just interested in them and all they want to do is see them. Some guys look at her face (me), some guys just look at her overall body. it varies, and it also varies with the girl|`|not66e2Caa	i look at a girls height, then eyes, then hands (dont ask about the last one lolol) i like a more natural looking girl i.e without tons of makeup|`|XsS5AsM4aa	Hair then slowly asses the rest of the girl i love long hair the darker the better big tatas are a plus 2|`|34vLaCO6aa	Face, breasts (cleavage), legs (if she wears short pants or miniskirt). in that order.    Though a friend of mine looks at the butt before the breasts. Some men are like that..    btw, anyone who will deny that he looks at the breasts\butt, is either gay or a liar.    another comment: when drunk and with low ambient lights, a man might see a woman more beautiful than she is.|`|u543zrC0aa	Butt|`|00mqI4pUaa	face, then tittys|`|FrlZlRYeaa	Face|`|1A72Np7daa	eyes, lips, booty =D|`|O28wFc4Eaa	i would first c her face, hairdo, and their outfit

9Yrh6IIzaa	He's young. Its normal.Its the second one.|`|5d5f37f5c62e8fc8705b22eb86a38727aa	More so the first then the second. I mean it does mean he gets horny fairly easily but guys don't usually get hard that easily if they don't like the person that turns them on.|`|fcb1efacb648b3f1b1c0eff5cf18ba7daa	horny all the time        duh.|`|ph9OmfBwaa	kinda both lol|`|s5Pu6jd7aa	i think it is cuz of both reasons. plz read my poem.|`|4LaeyQCMaa	Your must be very attractive to him.   When that happens to me, its because of the fact that I like the girl alot! and she is turning me on.  or he could be thinking that that your going to let him get some.|`|WZvZJXnPaa	i would agree that it is alittle of both he is probably just a horndog but it wouldnt happen that easy if he didnt love you and still get butterflies every time you kiss him
502f46d0752a09474c222b5f7024a0daaa	i think today people start liking neat and clean faces ..............i don't think  that girls like moustache.................but some time it depends that it suits on the face of the person..............like in movie zoom barabar zoom Abhishek bacchan is looking very smart in long moustaches...........playing a role of panjabi munda...a bathinda boy|`|68msDkYUaa	depends on individual choice , but i think most city girls like it without moustache...........|`|7FCp1CMvaa	i have seen and had enough moustaches from my papaji.......goatees and stuff are fine though|`|AA11677113	Depends on the taste of the girl........i like without moustache.|`|d02bf4e776153376a2122d2c188391daaa	I think it just depends on what suits the perosn!|`|0ac22429c997ea1ee7b420c9ad5a39b2aa	i prefer one with a moustache.i think it defines masculinity.|`|etUph2bvaa	trimmed with a trimmed goatee and it depends on the age group your interested in and it depends on your faceshape|`|9c7c968b4d0bff8dc041cc7e56619531aa	depends upon the girl,,,,but most like clean shave|`|J2WlVJvOaa	As otherz say- it varies from person to person....for me, I prefer Abhishekh Bachchan's style in Bluffmaster or shaven beard. It also depends on d age tho.... Im a kid, lol, 14... But anywayz, only u can tell wat suits u best|`|X97Ib1ARaa	without one cause it gets irritatin when u kiss dat person  i think a lot of girls wit agree on me not just indian but all the girls|`|QjGFtcQoaa	without...they look cleaner..nd it shows off the guy's facial glow
bVLWVonUaa	You don't need to have a girlfriend to be happy and complete.  Who cares.  The right girl will come along when you least expect it, don't be desperate and don't go looking for it like this.  It will come as a surprise I bet, all good things do.
q8XOw3jTaa	The truth is: They don't baby, they don't.    The only reason a person belittles you is because they want you to be little.    We need to being in the love and push out the mean.    So sayeth the Ninja of Love.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	I know what you mean.  I can't believe people write such mean things, especially when the person asking them seems to be having a difficult time in life.|`|mYA7rbIwaa	Most of the times people are rude because they have nothing better to do and have mental problems
Sz66aLWpaa	Ok my boyfriend and I are about the same age as you so... We've done pretty much everything except sex. ANd we've been dating 3 months. We're both pretty wild kids and talked for a few months before we were dating but still.  I don't consider myself being loose or a whore or anything we just really like eachother and can't get enough.|`|WPPhb2craa	This is a question that only you and your partner can answer. First I would suggest that you give a lot of thought as to whether you truly think that you are ready to take things to another level. First experiences will be your memory forever and you will regret it forever if you rushed into something and were not prepared.   The least awkard way to go about this is to sit down with your partner and discuss each others thoughts. This may seem like it would be uncomfortable, but it is less weird than if you tried to go father and they wern't ready.  IF the two of you do decide to make a commitment, remember to be very careful. Feelings will change after sex and if you don't go about it in an adult way pregnancy or STD's are a harsh reality.  The decisions you make in your life right now are adult decisions. Enjoy being innocent for as long as you can because these are the years that shape who you will be.  Hope this helps!|`|xm7kFnfNaa	I would proclaim my love by dressing in a trench coat, giving myself an 80's haircut and holding up a boombox outside her window to proclaim my love. Yup, I'd go that far.
6Y1mJgauaa	If you really, really want to be friends with this person keep trying, but if you could go either way or don't really care just stop.|`|3w1u6mQJaa	I think you should have kept talking to her on Facebook than Texting her. Those if remember this person well I think you should pursuing your friendship.|`|zUSzHqTXaa	I would write her on facebook and just say did you not want me to text you because I did and you didn't answer.|`|bCDvuk7Faa	Hate to say this but I would suggest you give it up before you get emotionally hurt.
2f1667c15de1b4c2d12df8e7927add6faa	Pues mira, regularmente yo lo que hago es buscar algo que se adapte al regalo por ejemplo en tu caso siento que yo lo que hara sera meterlo en una caja de cereal, pero real, que en verdad sea la caja que traa el cereal!   djame decirte que yo he regalado hasta camisas en envolturas de galletas, botes de leche, o chocolate, y al principio s se desconciertan cuando ven que les llegas casi con la despensa , pero ya cuando lo abren es una grata sorpresa, ojala te guste!  Suerte!|`|LfVl2nzYaa	Hola:=)    Puedes envolverlo con periodico, o como un colachs (bueno no se como se escrive pero me entendiste) recorta todo lo que te guste de rebistas y libros que ya no te sirvan y haz un mural en tu libro eso sera original.

No se si conozcas esos globos inflados los cuales puedes meter un osito de peluche adentro, bueno pues mete tu libro en un globo con un osito de peluche adentro, que te parece, esta idea es muy original, ve a los lugares donde envuelven regalos, seguramente ahi ellos te lo pueden hacer.
PoJzRVEGaa	wtf ur old friend needs to get an effing life! she just wants attention. ignore her and show that you are so much better than she is, because you are!  :)|`|7TNz3LQUaa	Talk with your parents or have your phone number changed.  I had my phone number changed when an old friend was harrassing me! It took care of the problem!|`|lQdOdBqraa	i know how you feel. i was threatened with a knife and she actually got caught by bringing her brother's knife to school. get the principal, parents, and the cops. it's time for a wake up call for them. threatening to hit you with a metal baseball bat is a crime aka, harrasment. oh and don't even txt her back or call her.|`|8MTxFbctaa	Just kick her butt.  She's asking for it.    Or get some friends to do it for you :D  Just kidding!    Don't do that.  But you've been pretty nice.    Maybe you should try yelling at her so she knows she can't get away with it.    Some people mistake niceness and class for weakness but if you don't feel like yelling or anything maybe get your parents to talk to her parents about it.
IKrjHxKLaa	do you think your partner would be happy that you are giving some other guy massages?  would you like it if he gave them to other girls?  in answer to your question, you need to ask him!!|`|sPiwb8Hraa	His interest in your hands is a fetish, similar to a foot fetish. That' is not unusual. But him asking you for a neck massage, I can only suggest to you to tell him that this is inappropriate, because you are already taken. He doesn't sound dangerous so I wouldn't cancel the friendship (unless you want to). You'll have to be firm and assertive so he is clear. Maybe you could help him find someone.|`|gCyj3wbfaa	Maybe he fancies you (regardless of your 'marital' status) - ever thought of that?    Yeah I agree.    He'll be asking for head...    ... massage soon, lol!    Better watch out!|`|d0EyXi6paa	lol i dont kno  mayb he sees ur the only gurk that wud do it for him  try sayin no next time see how he responds teehee  but do it lol..|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Maybe because he enjoys having a good neck massage from you... doesn't necessarily mean anything.|`|HyBJwA6uaa	If you're not single why do you keep giving him neck rubs?|`|kQA7SbY9aa	I'm guessing that after you gave him the first neck massage, it felt so good that now he asks for them regularly? Maybe he has just become too comfortable with you giving them to him whenever he asks? The hand examination sounds like it might be some sort of fetish. Be careful that the closeness of those massages doesn't lead him to expect closeness in other areas, if you know what I mean. For you they might seem innocent, but to him, they may mean more.|`|QbuNwNlvaa	he has a sore neck?  maybe it doesn't mean anything?|`|cd58cfe23fe7751098de7f6842faa2b8aa	maybe he has a hand fetish|`|mHhDWtUaaa	Just rub his neck, dammit! He's not asking for much!|`|gIDRf6Tgaa	Sounds like he may have a fetish for your hands..There are many different fetishs out there|`|d7HO4XPVaa	Maybe he's got a neck problem! Maybe he likes long hands too.|`|AA10983636	why don't you ask him???|`|fXDMVFMTaa	It could be purely innocent.  Sometimes guys just wonder, if you are both friends and he is bold enough to ask about your hands and for a neck massage, then you should be able to ask him why he wants to know.  I will ask a guy friend why he wants to know something in a heartbeat.|`|YW3yJ1smaa	well mayb he is jus obsesed wit big hands?|`|74p0D7Lzaa	He'll be asking for head    massage soon|`|aVHgO5w2aa	Maybe your just the only friend willing to give him one so he continues to ask.|`|JrSJv7BTaa	Wow you do have big hands...big hands=great neck massage!!! I think he has a hand fetish my dear...and asking you for a neck massage is easier than saying "I have this hand fetish and I want you to touch me"|`|7emMTCv2aa	i do it too to this girl at skool..... i do i coz she is like sooo good at it! and coz i lie flirting a little.    maybe he kinda likes you and is trying to get closer to your or somthing|`|Ac4NACNUaa	Who knows? He could just be friendly, or eccentric. There's a good chance he's trying to make a move on you, though-- or perhaps he likes you romantically and will simply take what physical contact he can get.    Then again maybe he's gay.|`|4BO8LTOYaa	hes using u for neck massages? lol|`|iwBOGDKDaa	He probaby likes you but respects the fact you're not single. He just can't help himself wanting to feel your touch|`|dN8o1zYAaa	maybe you give great massages, maybe he has a hand fetish, maybe he likes you secretly and you giving him massages is a way to have some kind of intimate contact with you (not in a perverted way..... or maybe i don't know) but i think the best way to figure it out would be to just ask him. that's what i would do!!!|`|yzMSVEkgaa	well it looks like this guy has a thing for you!!!  and even though you may think that this guys is a little wierd it may be that he just thinks that the hands are the sexiest female feature. i once met a guy who was IN LOVE with feet!! (well i thought he was strange but he just thought that feet were the seyiest female feature. and by he always wants you to give him neck massages ( i would might want to stop) by you giving him neck massages it is most likely to turn him on or he wants you to be close to him but i may be wrong.
Gy4e4xF9aa	the one that makes you cry becuase only the ones you love the most can make you cry happy tears and sad ones ....  lots of people can make you laugh     God blesss..|`|TbsbfC9gaa	the kind love dat make you cry y? cuz love don't come in an come out like dat you have to be real to you an dat special one in your life|`|QiwF22wNaa	laugh. nobody wants to cry.|`|SS9RY0IAaa	The love of money.

That is a very strong and smelly love.|`|G1uIE61gaa	i believe the love that surpasses  all things with the love of god first, the faith to believe and the lot less pride to face the situation or time (limit) to stand through and in it. but when u sit and think o it for your self, ull get the true meaning that u need to b Willing to need someone loving them when it gets messy|`|zxtTPIWOaa	both... the love that can make you cry but at the end of the day there's still the same love that will make you smile this time..

If she does, then date the other guy.    :D|`|XIcXbLSLaa	seriously, your only 16, so you shouldn't be thinking about sex (appears to me that you're hinting you'll have sex with your good friend's bro since you pointed out that he's 18,your 16 and it's illegal?) okay anyway, your still young, so why the rush to get into a relationship? you, yourself are vexed and you did say it yourself that you do not wish to make a wrong decision.     So, take a chill pill and let nature take its course, see how things will turn out to be, sit back, relax and observe to determine who is really the one meant for you. If someone's meant for you, he will be yours no matter how long it takes. The most important thing is never to rush into a relationship because the effects of a breakup is really horrendous and sucky. So you do want to be careful and choose the right partner.     Before getting a relationship, you want to really make sure that you like the person for who he is, not because he looks cute, etc etc, otherwise things may not turn out to be as nice as you thought it would be. So don't fret too much now nor think too much. Calm yourself and free yourself of all these thoughts for some time, it'll make your mind clearer and hopefully you can work out and see who suits you more.     Bottom line: don't rush into a relationship.     all the best! ((:|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	First...in a lot of states (like mine) 16 and 18 together isn't illegal, but I think that is beside the point. Do you really want to date someone your not that into just because the person you are into doesn't seem interested? What if the guy you REALLY like becomes interested while you are with this other guy? Are you going to break his heart and dump him then? I say stay friends with your friend and go for the guy you are really into. It might not turn out the way you want it to but at least you tried.|`|KjLv5ygvaa	YOU have to decide which one you have strongr feelings for and then take a chance with whichever one it is.|`|ahFwcF7iaa	ask the guy you really like if he likes you back, but if you dont feel right with the other guy you dont have to go with him, there is probably more people whoo like you at your age, and if you do like the one whos 18, then its only illegal if ur parents dont allow it, they can give you permissoin(in some states) and others its illegal if you do something... but its your choice who your with, you dont have to pick the first guy|`|nAunir9Qaa	well if one of the guys is not 18+ than i'd go w/him....doing crap against the law comes back to you...

fP05qJ26aa	well maybe u should tell ur bf and old friends how u feel and apoligize even if it aint ur fault.tell them u want it to be like the old days and be friends again.and start talkin bout fun/funny stories from wen u guys used to hang and maybe ull get them bak.|`|4tYtg9ECaa	I don't know what actually happened between the two of u that there seem to have a cold war going on. But, u know, all wars come to an end. It's not that bad yet, coz u feel something still for each other, be it anger, disappointment, or annoyance. The worst thing is when u feel indifferent to each other. Don't let your friendship die.. Do something.. Bestriends are supposedly inseparable souls, though sometimes physically apart. Things will indeed never be the same again if u completely lose each other..|`|m2Dtvssdaa	I don't know all your situations so you're going to have to think. Apologize? or just talk to them and if they're rude screw them You can make new friends.
hYVpVi8zaa	Dificil porque es tu madre estoy seguro que si fuese otra persona la pones de inmediato en su lugar pues a nuestros cachorros no nos gusta ni queremos que otros la hagan sentir mal, o menos, dile a tu madre habla con ella preguntale porque tiene preferencias acaso tu no llevas su sangre, no te quedes de brazos cruzados si tu no protestas ella pensara que hace bien y seguira con su misma actitud pero si le dices con educacion y respeto lo que piensas quiza lo tome en cuenta. Y bueno en tu casa las reglas las pones tu nadie mas.  Bendiciones :)|`|ic3ZIBEwaa	que hables con ella y que te motivos suficientes para que le haga eso a tu hija y si no los tiene di le que ati te lastima demasiado esa actitud y que tu como madre sabes que siempre estars dispuesta a todo por tu hija|`|kHpbUcAOaa	mira la vida es dificil y si existen las preferencias en hijos nietos sobrionos, hermanos, en todo.... yo creo que deberias de independizarte o buscar un lugar donde te cuiden a tu hija mientras llegas porque con el timpo la ni?a se dara cuenta y se puede traumar. y suerte.|`|2wDJmluOaa	yo  creo que lo mejor es hablarlo directamente con ella, decirle lo que has visto  para eso necesitas recordar situaciones especificas para que no haya posibilidad de que ella se safe diciendo que no es cierto o que tu exageras, dale ejemplos concretos y te sugiero que no menciones favoritismos hacia tu sobrina a pesar de que sean evidentes pues eso solo lograra que compare a las dos ni?as y de lo que se trata es de aclarar el trato hacia tu hija y nadamas  suerte|`|F5XGX0iFaa	Es solo mi opinion, pero al menos yo alejaria a mi hija de mi madre, para que quiero a alguien que la maltrate asi cerca de ella.

Tu tienes tu casa, no permita que vaya a tu casa a maltratar a tu hija.  Quien golpea a tu hija, tu sobrina o tu mam? y te digo que si es tu mama porque se lo permites, es una mujer adulta como va a hacer esas cosas con una beb de 3 a?os.  Te aconsejo que dejes de pelear con ella, slo deja de invitarla a tu casa y trata de ir lo menos posible a la de ella, ojal con eso se de cuenta de que es una mujer demasiado adulta como para hacer esas cosas y ya termine con la discriminacin como abuela con tu hija y no te la maltrate.  Cuida lo tuyo, tu mam ya tuvo su tiempo, respetala y quierela, pero de lejos, protege, ama y dale buena formacin a tu hija.

Como tu dices, son cosas de ni?as...y eso k ahorita son ni?as, imaginate k hara tu madre el dia de ma?ana cuando hija sea adolescente...soportaras las mismas (o peores) criticas? k flojera la vdd...|`|QUbPNJfCaa	Hola Gretel, primero hay que aceptar simplemente que puede haber preferencias entre hijos y nietos, eso es inevitable y la solucin a eso es poner distancia de por medio.    Sin embargo hay que considerar algo, es muy probable que tu hija sea una persona agresiva y que tal vez su educacin no ha sido la mejor, me refiero a que es probable que tu hija sea dominante y tal vez muestre cierto egosmo y rebelda, como cualquier ni?o busca atencin y al ver atencin de la abuela en su prima, es muy probable que la agreda para conseguir esa atencin.    Debes en mi opinin, hablar lo ms claro posible con tu hija para que comprenda y aprenda esta situacin, analiza y cuida la relacin de las primas y ve que es lo que est sucediendo, es muy probable que tu madre lo nico que quiera hacer es defender a su otra nieta que es probable que no tenga la capacidad de defenderse de tu hija.    Si consideras que no aprecio bien la situacin y que el comportamiento de tu madre es totalmente injusto, pues no expongas a tu hija a esa situacin, no juntes a las primas y analiza el comportamiento de tu madre para con tu hija pero estando solamente con ella. Otra cosa importante es entender que a veces los asuntos pendientes y estresantes entre madre e hija pasan automticamente al trato para con los nietos....    Pinsalo.

989549bb161ae5e62a2d42e91d8696f8aa	Amiga mia, hay una respuesta para ello, Mas all de los sue?os, solo tienes que tomar su lugar suplantar el lugar que le corresponde que el vea que tu al infierno iras con el, no rega?es, no relates no te enfades, armate tan solo de valor y paciencia, sortea cada da como un pice de esperanza que el va  a ver, lucha con el, no para el, el tiene que tener la confianza de que tiene a su lado un salvador o salvadora, mi pregunta es .... Estas tu dispuesta a ser esa salvadora? si es as no tengas apuro, sed lo y salva su vida y tu relacin, pide a dios ayuda para que gue tus pasos y los de el, reza orando, hablando en tu y yo con el supremo y veras como todo te sale redondo, yo no quiero diez puntos, se los puedes dar a quien tu quieras, pero si me gustara saber que dejasteis de sufrir y el sigue estando junto a ti en largo tiempo, suerte y que dios te bendiga|`|2wDJmluOaa	Si estas con el, apoyalo en lo que el te pida, pero de ninguna manera asumas el papel de su mama, su enfermera ni nada similar. No es tu responsabilidad, si el no se ayuda a si mismo que puedes hacer tu??? Por lo que dices lo has intentado de diferentes maneras haciendole entender el beneficio que va a tener al cuidarse asi que esta tranquila en ese sentido.  Se que tal vez vayas a considerar que es muy drastico pero si realmente estar con el te afecta, en el sentido de estar demasiado presionada, preocupada y tener problemas constantes considera si deseas seguir asi pues no puedes estar atenida a que el vaya a entender y cambiar de un dia para otro.|`|xaMOB83Caa	Lo primero es entender que el que tiene los problemas de salud es tu esposo no tu; y al paso que vas te puede afectar toda esta situacion en tu salud personal.    Entiendo que sea tu esposo, lo ames y te preocupes por el, pero no eres su MAMA, ya que al parecer a su familia, (osea hermanos y padres de l) ya entendieron y respetan que es adulto y toma sus propias decisiones.    Creo que por lo que cuentas aunque te pares de cabeza el ya te demostro que no le interesa su propia persona y aunque esto duele mucho, al parecer no va ha buscar ayuda profesional, mucho menos psicologica ,  asi que lo unico (a mi punto de vista) que te toca hacer, es decidir si quieres estar con una persona asi, y si es asi, respetar si es que esta deprimido, enojado o como este y se quiere morir, tal vez esta forma de darle la oportunidad de encargarse de si mismo, lo haga reflexionar, por que a fin de cuentas, si tu le dices que hacer, es muy comodo para el y de pilon si no resulta termina siendo tu culpa, por tus hijos y por tu salud mental, corta ese tipo de dependencia emocional, no eres responsable de el, cuando te casaste no lo adoptaste, decidiste compartir tu vida con el.      P.D. Animo!!!  Suerte y saludos.|`|9dc15212898711e81881b5af6bbc0fd9aa	Hola Amiga me imagino el momento en el que te encuentras, Esas son enfermedades silenciosas, mortales e implacables, atacan cuando menos lo imaginas, Tu esposo debio ser un hombre activo toda su vida de alli que no quiera resiganarse a postrarse en una cama y menos un hospital, bueno mujer es cuestion de que el se de cuenta de quien lleva las riendas ahora, de una forma muy sutil debes imponer la necesidad de seguir su tratamiento Uds. las mujeres pueden influir de tal forma en un hombre, no muestres tu lado (vas a morir ve a la consulta tomate las dosis) si no tu lado (te casaste o vives conmigo soy tu esposa y te impongo que asistas con efectividad a tus consultas no seas envidioso y actua como un hombre maduro) las personas ante situaciones asi en su vida pierden el rumbo y el camino y necesitan mas que un angel para seguir adelante...

Tambin plantale tu punto de vista y lo que sientes al respecto, que te diga si le gustara que pronto lo dejaras viudo y viviera as por muchos a?os, o si estara dispuesto a pasar todos los das en terapia intensiva cuidndote solo por que no queras cambiar tus hbitos de vida.  Tal vez el no ha pensado en el otro punto de vista.    Por ltimo, el tiene la opcin de decidir sobre su salud y su vida, tu tambin tienes esa opcin.  Que decides sufrir a su lado o tratar de salvarte de ese sufrimiento, si tu estas bien posiblemente le puedas ayudar, si estas igual de mal que el no va a haber quien los salve a ustedes dos.

2wDJmluOaa	mhhhhh dificil situacion para t, todos cuando estamos fuera de un caso siempre podemos dar una solucin lgica pero cuando somos quienes tienen los sentimientos involucrados todo se complica  primero que nada, aunque sea tu novio (o fuera tu esposo y llevaran a?os juntos) no creo que debas "exigir", sino decirle lo que tu deseas y saber si el es capaz de dartelo o de hacerlo, explicar el da?o que la bebida no controlada le hace a el mismo y a la relacion que tienen  supongo que el todo el tiempo que llevan juntos han habido muchas situaciones dificiles que has "aguantado" por lo que sientes por el y por el deseo de lograr una buena relacin.  Piensa bien si realmente ya no sientes interes de salvar la relacin pues si es as no tiene caso que te hagas perder el tiempo a ti misma, considera si no es solamente tu reaccin ante una mala racha que desafortunadamente hay muchas. Siempre cada uno vamos a sentir que somos los que damos mas en la relacin y en muchas ocasiones si esta desbalanceado en ciertos aspectos pero si es francamente desequilibrada considera que existe una gran posibilidad de que sea as por el resto del tiempo que esten juntos.   No se si tu novio se preste a hablar las cosas tranquilamente, pero creo que es lo que debes intentar, dejar claro que quiere cada uno y como pueden lograrlo. Siempre habra recaidas pero si deseas estar con el sern "soportables" hasta el grado donde se mantenga el respeto de ambos.   Jajaja creo que me extendi mucho en mi respuesta, pero entiendo como te sientes y deseo que logres estar mas tranquila|`|eelXwbF5aa	Amiga.

Ahora para ti el semaforo est en luces rojas de alerta, si el no va a un centro de rehabilitacin te aseguro que no podrs con el paquete simepre etars diciendo "Ahora si Cambiar".

Fue porque ella pensaba que tu la enga?abas, o porque tu en verdad si la enga?abas, siempre hay que ver por el que tiene la razon, si tu la enga?abas, entonces fue culpa tuya, de todas maneras de quien haya sido la culpa no tiene mucho que ver, porque si ella te dejo porque tu la enga?abas, o porque pensaba que tu la enba?abas, ella no te ha dejado de querer, y es verdad lo que dise que aun te ama, tienes que analizar la situacion desde todos los puntos, y yo creo que lo mejor para todos, y sobre todo para ese angelito de dios que es tu hija, la cual no tiene la culpa de nada, es que vuelvan, y veras que todo va a marchar bien, claro si tu sientes que la amas todavia, solo que no te demores mucho la proxima vez en reconocer tus errores, o los de ella, y hablar de ello, porque sin comunicacion, las parejas no avanzan, bueno muchos saludos, ojala que todo se resuelva y que te balla muy bien, suerte bye|`|7KiW0Ppdaa	la verdad creo que est jugando contigo, solo vean el no lastimar a tu hija!!!!|`|QKWgXYFpaa	pues,pienso cuate que el primero que deve,saber que hacer eres tu, si tu la quieres,si tu la amas, y si estas dispuesto a perdonarla,porque ya sabes como es uno de hombre,machista,el echo que ya se caso y que tuvo relaciones con su ahora esposo,sabes ponle una trampa,siguele su juego,sal con ella,preguntale que si esta dispuesta hacer el amor con tigo, estando ya casada,y despues aguas,porque si dice que si tendras tremendo broncon, ya sabes te decides a decirle que de una ves nooooooo para siempre  que se divorcie yse case con tigo y atenerte a las consecuencias ,de que te pueda poner los cuernos  es de pensarce un resto que DIOS te ilumine para que tomes la mejor desicion suerte.|`|BDnSeDNbaa	te ama y se caso con otro, mas bien debes de hablar con ella y ver que es lo mejor para su hija|`|y5cCjKxSaa	si te kiere k empiece por dejar a su esposo, asi te demostrara ke es verdad, como puede estar con un apersona amando a otra??? :S:S:S|`|DUTG3jHqaa	si en un mes se caso con otro!  me suena a que: lo tenia cuando estaba con vos!  y busco la escusa de que la enga?abas para dejarte!  tu ex cambia muy rpido de sentimientos.  yo te dira que pienses en tu hija.  si van y..vienen en la relacin la podes perjudicar!  pensa en tu ex como la madre de tu hija.  por ahora!deja que pase el tiempo.  y..si realmente te quiere.  van a estar juntos mas adelante.  pero no ahora ,ella eligi a otro hace un mes.  suerte|`|hsTAfUmMaa	no creo que sea verdad, creo que tu ex es de esas personas que no saben a ciencia cierta que es lo que queiren o que quiere tener a los 2 , a su esposo y a ti, yo te aconsejo que tengas cuidado o puedes salir lastimado,     otra cosa si dices que se caso con el otro al mes , eso de que la estabas  enga?ando pudo haber sido solo un pretexto|`|kFXFXQetaa	Pues ella cometio un error muy grande al casarse con otra persona solo por despecho, la comunicacion es muy importante eln la pareja.Solo piensen que de todos los errores que cometan  los mas danados siempre son los hijos.|`|kVaReTfzaa	amigo creo que eya estaba confundida deberas pensarlo muy bien pero piensalo tu no puedes desidir mediante otras jentes una parte muy importante de tu vida|`|373536ea0e9aa4cfd1684d46dfb223ecaa	Es una mentira!|`|Th3Vjplcaa	por supuesto que esta jugando contigo y que mala onda de su parte que sea asi por que hacen da?o a terceras personas y no es cierto que ella pensara que la estabas enga?ando eso solo fue un pretexto para poderse casar te recomiendo que solo veas a tu hija a ella ya no la veas hazlo por tu nena para que no le hagan da?o lo unico que ella quiere es sentirte seguro por si la otra relacion no funciona regresar contigo y eso jamas!!!!! valorate y ps no te puedes alejar por que tiene algo en comun pero ps pon limites con la ni?a todo con ella nada ok!!!!!!!!!

GuRluYmraa	confidence is important so that you can encourage yourself to do great thiings in life. There is a big difference between confidence and cockyness. No girl likes a cocky guy who thinks hes 'it'. you dont seem to be this kind of guy.. thank god!  Just be yourself and dont try to 'conform' to what you think girls like. The more comfortable you are within yourself the more confident you will be. i think confidence comes with lifes experiences, you will realise whats important in life. dont change yourself but do allow yourself to grow and mature. I think you should relax and if you like a girl just talk to her like you would with a good friend.  if you really think you need somethink to get yourself more confident then do something new, join a club, take up a new hobby.  Good luck |`|hsDAchyzaa	I think you already know the answer to your question lol. If you really can't wait, and you want to change then go for it. As long as you're comfortable with doing so. By the sound of it, you don't have any reason to not be confident. Be proud and feel proud of who you are, and if a woman says no, don't let it get to you. You can move on, but just be yourself.  |`|sASRK3oXaa	I think you just need to stop thinking about having a relationship and see what happens enjoy yourself while your young, you dont need to change yourself you just need to grow some balls and ask them most women always say yes to a free drink.|`|qqKWPG4caa	change that kind of attitude. its not good. really|`|Wu0Bal4aaa	You just have to get over that shyness and just do it. You have to be bold and not afraid of rejection. It is not the worst thing in the world. ANY girl would be flattered if you asked to get them a drink or asked for their number. Just don't be a creeper and you'll be fine lol. You dont have to be confident, just act confident and with time it becomes part of you. I was never confident I was beyond shy but I just made myself act like I knew what I was doing and that nobody was better than me and they see that and are drawn to you. You just have to take that leap and in time you will become used to it and become comfortable. I promise, what do you honestly have to lose? For all you know you could never see them again so why not give it a shot? You live only once in this lifetime make the best of it and if you want something you need to go for it. :)|`|Og0d9Ja6aa	perhaps you never asked a girl "can i buy you a drink"? because you are only 19. unless it was a soda =] and truthfully, girls love a guy with confidence. so if a guy has the nerve to walk up and talk 2 a girl, he gets major points. just be confident and know its not the end of the world if she turns you down. best of luck =]|`|q0ldyrn4aa	Try watching the movie "Hitch." It's good to have confidence just as long as you're not already getting too cocky. 
4JIPg4KRaa	Be more outgoing. Let people know your great personality and I am sure they will come to you.|`|5d1eb3f5bbbd42a73e087c7c1f511227aa	Because your the one with the great and sweet personality....stay that way in the end your the one that will end up with the great faithful husband .......just wait and see.........|`|yfHaNHfzaa	it depands how you act with guys, second it is said when you want some thing you wont get and vis versa...    learn from your sister what she does.........|`|PomGqb81aa	because you campare yourself to your sister all the time, that might be off putting to a guy because guys like confidence in a girl. don't worry about whats going on with your sister, just be yourself and be confident and SHINE! :] then boys will notice you for you :]|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Stop comparing yourself to your sister. You are your own person. Get out there and make the first move. If you want something, sometimes you have to do it yourself.

But,  they're fun.|`|kBixVQHhaa	My life sucks! Nothing good ever happens to me! I almost got run over by a bus yesterday. I found out that my cat got rabbis. I dropped my cellphone in our lagoon.

I am going to make 5k less this year at my job. Michigan football sucks right now. I don't have a girlfriend or any prospects. But my car is running well and I bought new furniture so I guess it isn't all bad just most of it. Thanks for pointing out how crappy some of our lives are.   
zpkr4rPeaa	A break-up after 2 years, and then 2 dates w/ you.  If I were in your shoes, I'd spend a bit of time in his.    If he rushes into a "serious" relationship with you,  he's running the risk of "rebounding.    What he's going through (and, I know I'm assuming that  it was a tough "break-up" for him) is not unusual, even for  a guy.     If you're having fun in his company, and you trust his judgment, there's nothing wrong with going slow & careful. He needs to have some time..if he was in the wrong, or the girl he was with broke up with him,  at least he'll take the time to learn from his "bad break-up" and be able to move on, with a clearer notion of what he wants.     You don't want to bring issues of the past into your relationship with him. Friends, true friends, have a better chance at being together longest....We all experience loss, or break-ups, in life. It's how we react to them, what we learn from them, that's important.    It may not take 5 months...at least, stay in touch with him.|`|2RhttNGGaa	oldest answer in the book...   if its meant to be itll happen.....|`|sOi9zWrlaa	hes a noob you can easily KO him if you use a strength potion but make sure to use protect meele incase he uses a DDS HES GUNNA GET UR ITEMS DONT DO IT OMFG!!!!!!!111111111111111111111|`|4ur1tTYdaa	Wait... if nothing happens... then forget about him... just be friends instead|`|mGGPSUqYaa	I think if he moved on you should too, he doesn't sound like he moved on if he didn't you should wait.
ubbzYUe4aa	man that's alot of complaining i got to answer this one.  check this out baby you want to be the center of aAttractiondon't you  you want to be popular specially withe girls not the boy too much don;t ya.  now they don;t like you cuz you sound like a selfish self center emo bi'tch who has envies of the other peoples life and thats really bad cuz you got to live on insed your own skin.  my advice go a jong for a cople of hours out there stop watching american idol if that sh still around and stop lookin at some one elses lifes, and go get your own, out of the couch i mean.  youll see that life will sparkels at you and youll be thanking me cuz of this advice.  and if you don't like what i say you can alway i mail me i'll take any ho up for grabs if it is available  P.D. all make you feel like you are the center of the universe peace out.........|`|TV6Fg9bWaa	Man, well we all have problems. some worse than others. first of all dont feel fat an ugly!!! like that will ever help your depression. you are beutiful everyone is. the true definition of beautiful applies to whatever excites the keenest of pleasure to the senses and stirs emotion through the senses. pretty much it is saying it doesnt have to be outside beuty but inside beuty. and pretty is word i dont use... it means superficial or insubstantial attractiveness . which means pretty is a sorta shallow word. be beautiful on the inside andlife will be good.  you can be beautiful many ways you can be joyful, happy, and stop holding grudges (treat everyone equal). follow the word of god (bible or church) . you can meet new friends there who shouldnt care who or where you came from, they care about the inner you (usually). to get more friends be.... how do you say it.... outgoing i guess. say hi to new people, hi to people you already know. smile in the hallways. they may not to be your best friends but first you must talk to them to find out. oh and that igrl who thinks your a total loser will so regret it when she sees you arnt mourning over what she said last period. ignore her there are better people you could hang out with. highschool is hard, but with these tips they can be so much better. also, no rumors. TAKE ALL THINGS YOU HEAR AND KEEP EM IN YOUR HEAD. and if someone says "guess what i just heard!" say "is this a rumor or something of importance?" dont say it agrily it will make them back away, but if it is a rumor its 99.9999% almost never true. no need to hear it.    you probably didnt read all that but this is how i survived highschool. and yes life sux until your become a joyful person. you are beautiful you dont need to show me a pic to know that. i am glad i could help byas!! |`|pbGmQ7Seaa	hm, well if you really feel fat. join a sport you like ex  swimming, figure skating, gymnastics, ringette, soccerr . :)     and then you'll make friends there, and start treating people  like you want them to treat you. but if your doing that already.  you could maybe switch schools. focus on your education, and then make friends by being nice. ending fights they started and saying sorry.    and maybe get a myspace, make friends on that. make friends on here, and go to the mall and get some clothes that make you feel good. :)    hope this works.    maybe see a counsellor, about your self esteme.    confidence is key. |`|WDD6P3Zpaa	hmm.    well, maybe when you get out of school it will be better.    just watch a good movie.    and then you'll feel better.    haha honestly, or music or something. something good     nothing depressing.    i honestly dont know what to say.    but always hope for something better, i guess.|`|0uqoCuPZaa	stop whining and go on a diet tubby|`|pWsbbQ7eaa	Aw..it's okay.          GO TO A DOCTOR  YOU HAVE A VERY LOW SELF EESTEEM|`|nZgDqymHaa	you just need to forget about all of them and focus on your school work and don't worry about them.|`|wlY1UgQHaa	talk to ur conselar sounds like u neeed confidense in urself|`|eLkxLVo7aa	you really have some serious issues but the only thing you could do is change your attitude towards life. If you don't like yourself how do you expect others to like you. You could probable change your personality and be more nice or the way you dress. I know several people that are fat but they dress really cute and they look cute and pretty. Are you actually fat or you just feel fat. Is just your attitude that doesn't take you no where.  Think positive and everything will change.|`|BImeQEtWaa	WOW    what do  want to be told  should i sympathize you well i wont ! if you have a problem go  do something about it .it doesn't sound like you  want any help your just bitching.  why don't  u write a blog on your myspace or some **** like that and stop trying to find salvation from random ignorant people on the internet. what do  want to be told  should i sympathize you well i wont ! if you have a problem go  do something about it. get it straight and stop bitching or just kill yourself because this just crap
QLZduKrMaa	If you don't have a fever and haven't gone to a doctor, you go to school. You're just not sick enough. If you really feel that bad, you need to go to the doctor to get a professional opinion.|`|RINX5KTTaa	Your mother doesnt want you to fail. If you were serously sick I am sure she would fell that you staying home would be better. But because you are not bed riden then she figures you can suck it up and go to school.    We have all dealt with it. You will understand when you become a parent yourself    I am 5 months pregnant and I already understand certain things that my parents have done    But chances are if you are on here, and are well enough to write this question, she thinks you will do just as well on your school work    Fell better  Remmber your parents do the things they do because they love you, you should listen|`|AA11349925	If you were extremly ill you wouldn't be able to get out of bed, you wouldn't be able to stay awake.    You've got a cold, take some paracetemol and go to school.|`|3onAxcR0aa	she is worried that you will fall behind in lessons  also alot of kids take one day off and never want to go back to school again|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	Dig your heels in, she's underestimated how ill you are, just get back into bed and stay there, she cant drag you in, well she can, but im sure she's not that mean :P|`|qvWjKYVGaa	She probably doesn't want you too fall behind|`|dUzPxJeLaa	she doesn't want you to end up failing school and be a dropout reject|`|GuRluYmraa	maybe she thinks your trying to avoid school for some reason  maybe she would have to miss work or she has important plans that she cant miss  I dont know, maybe ask her  It seems unfair whatever you have could be passed on to people at school, I just got a sore throat from my 3 yr old nephew which he probably caught at preschool!|`|pU9Ct7qwaa	that is out of order if u r feeling unwell yr moter should let you stay off school  what happenes if something worse happened 2 you when u was in school like fainting or something  your mom will feel guilty    i would never send my daughter 2 school if she was feeling umwell|`|6b28cb30e6e77746159e9b02aac8faadaa	I can understand why she's pushing you, maybe to the point of it not being reasonable. At the same time, if you have claimed illness once too often for her tastes when probably thinks you are wanting to skive off.     An aside, I know a woman who broke her arm playing sport at school. The nurse gave heraspirinn and sent her back to class twice.    Her mum got her fixed that evening. Next day nurse had nerve enough to ask the girl what happened. You can imagine what the young woman had to say.     Some of these school nurses are evil incarnate. |`|bwlB9Lrtaa	Because she wants you to have an 100% attendance record?    Hope you don't mind me saying but your mum's got a silly attitude, because at the end of the day your health will benefit if you have a day or two's rest. Is she trying to tell you attendance is more important than health? I don' t think so....|`|VwmqpqHiaa	well she obvioulsy doesnt want you to fail at school.  you'll probly have to copy up, and the you wont be botherd and that and she knows that you will fall behind.  maybe if you promise her that you will copy up and that then she may let you have the day off.  all school nurses are like that they do not care.  but,  you should take some paracetamol, and eat plenty of lollies and that, it's good for your throat, and keep sucking on throat sweets :).    i hope you get better,  and have a day off school too. x|`|VvPJkjjZaa	My mum never let me stay of sick from school either. Now that I'm older I never call in sick for one and I'm pretty reliable. My boyfriend was allowed to stay off sick whenever he wanted and has lost so many jobs through being unreliable. I think your mum just wants to teach you reliability so you don't turn into a hypochondriac|`|pwdYoJ1Kaa	the drop out rate is so high right now that she doesn't want you to end up like the rest of the kids and throw your life away and she is probably scared that is what you are going to do, also she was also a kid once and most of the time (not saying your doing this) but kids will fake sick just to stay home so she probably thinks you are trying to pull a fast one on her. also when you get out into the real world and you have a job and have a family to support you wont be able to take off when you are sick most of the time (especially with how messed up the economy is now) and you will just have to suck it up and go to work or else your kids wont have anything to eat because you wont be getting paid so don't start the bad habit now. we all suffer a little bit

I mean if you love him very much and dont want it to end, then i would try and work something out with him, but if he isnt anything all to get worked up about i think you should find someone else, once i told  boyfriend that i didnt want to date a kid, he kinda manned up a bit|`|NCGcY5VSaa	Keep on loving him.|`|svbt7Fgeaa	You know what, my partner goes on xbox live a couple of times a week and his brother goes on for about 6 hours while his gf's at work (nearly every day)      Men never really grow up and their life is more or less video games/sleep/beer and obv that changes as they get older (i.e. kids etc)    I would rethink your relationship if he doesn't make time for you and all he does is play on that.

If he reacts badly to it and refuses to talk about the future and/or change, then it might be time to move on.     You'll never know until you bring it out in the open.

I would wait for the right moment to talk to her when she is all alone and not many people can eavesdrop.    Usually in order to talk to the objective, you must talk to the obstacle. Her friend is the obstacle.     Good Luck:) |`|p1RELUkTaa	Just taser her friend. Tackle the chick you want to talk to. You need to get as close to her face as you can get with out touching it ...and scream/spit what you need to say to her. Then run. The cops are prolly on the way by then.    Good luck.|`|yFowpLCAaa	Here is what I would do.... Bring up a guy or girl friend of yours and have him or her start talking to the friend. Then just pick up conversation with the girl you like. After that ask her if she wants to eat (school) lunch with you. If things are going well ask her for her phone and add yourself and most likely she will walk over and be like "what are you doing?" *giggle* and you will say "I am adding my number!" and then she will prob. laugh :) good luck!|`|TyoKxPJmaa	To be honest- there is no secret. All you have to do is start talking!    Im sure the girl will be impressed if you talk to her- lots of guys might be to scared- but not you- right?

Good Luck :)|`|f5n1LrUAaa	well first you open your moth   i actual am talking to a girl on the Phone right now|`|v29VOgloaa	just say hey or tell her she's pretty, girls like that ;]   jk  Sit with her at lunch and if she starts being rude to you jus tell her to f*** off!!  hahaha, well not exactly f*** off!!  |`|YSwYC2kSaa	easy just go up to her and be like hi. but to the two of them. smile at the girl that u like and look her in the eyes. dnt say u cant talk to her cuz ur to shy. if u cant communicate how r u ever gonna make her urs?  anyway ask her if she knows where room something is than thank her and wen u see her later on in class or w/e say hey. or just smile and make eyes contact. if u want more help email me.|`|k5wqvI42aa	idk i guess my skool is just really exceptional with this, but whenever somebody wants to talk to another person at my skool, guy or girl, regardless of who they are with, they just go up and say hi,,,, and everyone is really welcoming|`|p4ua3r3Vaa	First, you should never think of a girl as "yours". Second, try talking to both her and her firend, like "hey girls, hows it going?", then maybe try to direct the conversation in the direction of the girl you like. ask "how id you do on that math test today?". Be nice to her firends, if they dont like you she wont either.|`|i03f3HWPaa	crack jokes. talk about pancakes. all of the boys that go to my school talk about pancakes when they want to go out with somebody... or the videos that they make on youtube... or their awesome myspace profile... oh well. you'll think of something|`|pqrviNkeaa	She can't ALWAYS be around friends, you know. Don't search for moments to talk to her, I'm sure they'll come to you. Start out small, like "Do you know where this is?", or something along those lines. Just know this: If you don't do it, you'll regret it. And what you think may be the most embarrassing thing is actually nothing. Think about it: Earth is small compared to the sun, the sun is small compared to other things, etc. Your feelings are irrelevant and minuscule to the world. Just do it. Life's short.|`|YNT6nn1yaa	Well, first of all, it helps if you she is familiar with you. Friends is a huge bonus! even acquaintances is good. :D TRY and catch her when she is alone, but if she is with her friend all the time, maybe politely ask her if you can talk to her for a second. If you are around her a lot, like if you have a class or two with her or work with her, just be friendly and try and start a conversation. Once you get to know her and you aren't a stranger to her, maybe ask her for her phone number or ask her to hang out sometime. You never know, she might have a crush on you too, but you'll never know if you don't get out there and try!|`|xdsgoM8yaa	Just say hey and introduce yourself.

d43315c05c58ebbf69d41110fb0a9c88aa	Bonjour Mao    Il semble que vous avez essay pas mal de solutions et il est probable que vous en avez encore oubli.    Les gneurs par dfinition, font fi de tout, reflets de conflits enfouis en eux depuis des annes. Donc, armez vous bien puisque ces gens nont quune devise, je dis, donc, je pense. Ils leur arrivent parfois de rflchir. Le respect chez eux est pratiquement absent. Donc, ils ne se rendent pas compte qu'ils sont gneurs et envahissants.    Soucieux de leur image, ils se prsenteront comme sincres et amicaux et par la suite, vous leur dcouvrez une ralit antagoniste.    Ce sont leur manire de se dfouler, de se mettre en vidence. Il y a srieux blocage en eux.     De plus sur le net, leurs convictions et leurs attitudes ngatives se renforcent, (comparable  un mentor) d'autant plus qu'ils se sentent impunis, ce quils nosent pas faire dans la vie relle, o malgr tout, ils sont souvent associables.     Dominants, ces individus sont  instables, laches, colriques; ils manquent de recul, de discernement, et leur analyse est souvent fausse. L'esprit de projection est trs dvelopp et ils vous envoient leur propre image.    Contraris, ils se retranchent dans un humour, souvent sarcastique qui n'est autre qu'un mcanisme de dfense pour camoufler leur impuissance dans la vie o ils sont souvent incapables de se prendre en charge.    Demandez  un fou sil est fou ?    Ca revient au mme que de demander  un hypocrite si il est sincre.    Et de demander  ces gens de vous laisser tranquille, relve de l'utopie.    Ils saisiront la premire occasion pour revenir en force, mme si vous tes passs par une longue phase dabsence ou de silence.     Un jour, lorsque vous cesserez toute activit sur le net, oui vous aurez la paix. Tout comme, lorsque la distance entre vous et eux sera suffisante.    Bon, ceci sont souvent les traits principaux de ces gens mais comme dit plus haut, il sagit plus souvent de victimes qui se cachent et qui dans leur vie, ont t privs de repres primordiaux.    Bien  vous|`|af662b5dd0c837e02ca5d73a999389a1aa	Mais pourquoi tout cet harclement?

You can get more info here: http://document-do-it-yourself-service.c...

c77t5tCuaa	Hey! Really good first dates meant to impress always have the opposite effect. It almost always results in the girl feeling overwhelmed and uncomfortable and the guy being disappointed by her reaction.  Instead do something casual and normal. Do something you know she will enjoy and not feel pressured. Make her feel comfortable and she will enjoy the time with you. Having fun and being comfortable with you will always lead to a second date.  DON'T scare her off by being weird!|`|MGC1NKnVaa	Take her for a Salsa, Ballroom or Swing dance lesson at a nearby dance school.  Group classes are cheaper, but they might make you change partners a lot and you wouldn't get to spend a lot of time together.

Go and see a movie but ask her which she would like to see and even if you dont like it just see it. It always impresses the guy!  goodluck|`|cl3CV56Eaa	Do you know what she likes? You can plan around her likes. If she likes out doors then outdoors it is. but if she is like a girly girl who likes to stay in then bring her to a fancy restaurant.     out doors: Is there a beach near by? Bring her to the beach and set out a blanket and an umbrella or smthg. Make some sandwiches and watch the sunset.    OR go to the park and have a nice picnic (make some food, girls like guys who can cook. if you can't, just try to) under a tree and talk.    OR go to an amusement park. and then have lunch after.    or you can simply just take her out in your car, if you have one. and take out some food. Then park your car at some special spot and eat there, get to know each other more.     good luck! Hope you impress her|`|HnXZES3daa	Dinner, and a movie is always good. It is getting quite cold out, so Id say beach is out, besides its so cliche. What is she into though? You could do something like museum, or art gallery if she is more artsy like that. Or you can go paint balling or go carting if she is into fun things. There is always the options of cooking dinner and a movie in, but that may be too intimate for the first date, it depends on how well you two already know each other. You can go to mini golf, or a pool hall, there are so many options if she isn't too high maintenance, and likes a little fun.|`|EXLPcKKUaa	be  cute. offer ice cream or a movie so you can i dunno be cute and stuff... sorry i don't really know what actually.. i guess when you reach a certain level in your relationship you don't really think about the little stuff so much.. everyone should work on that .. but anywho getting back on the point of your date. again two words. be cute. you do that she yours.|`|yfHaNHfzaa	well what is the behaviour or your girl, i mean what does she need, i think you have to do it in a clasic style very simple but romantic or say like this Romantic Clasic Style.    thats it|`|mKqofJB4aa	make her a yummy dinner with candels and dessert!|`|ewItxpmTaa	Don't take her to the movies, its so impersonal and you wont get to know each other there.  Take her to dinner, go for a walk after.  Really it depends on the girl too.  I had a guy take me to the go-cart track our first date and I loved it!|`|0Di3Wnizaa	Lets see my dream date is to go horseback riding... but its probably too much money so maybe take her out to eat then go take a nice relaxing walk through the woods/park!
VSVQHKwKaa	No.    Look, girls expess emotions...and emotions change every second of everyday.    Guys express absolutes....and so if they say something that is wrong or a lie...they're either stupid or liars.     Girls don't have that rule. If something FEELS unfair to a girl...she says it's unfair.     So measure everything a girl says through that filter. If she says she likes someone else...she might mean it.    But that doesn't mean she'll feel that way tomorrow. |`|kT5Bk0T8aa	sometime they do and their are time they don't,but majority of the time we do mean what we say.|`|5nmvSXr4aa	Who knows.. could be a bunch of things.  Girls definitely do NOT always sa y what they mean.  If you like her, flirt, and see if she goes through with something.|`|RKQHRMusaa	urm it sounds like she likes you.. maybe its just like a cover story, that usually happens..|`|uADMcxyBaa	ummm.she likes you and wants to bang you.  so get to it!    :D      dont be silly,wrap your willy.|`|y46ZQItQaa	It sounds like she likes you and someone else. Ask her who she likes then start flirtin' with her. If she flirts back then take a chance. ask her out. Im a girl and unlike guys, we usually say what we mean.     Hope i helped :)|`|0yHRQPpzaa	No, she just wants to make you jealous.|`|lOtidcviaa	well maybe she does like someone else but you can never assume that so just keep trying!!|`|800ae356b1255c019be4ac7d08e8b34aaa	NO, SHE'S TESTING YOU SHE WANT YOU TO KNOW IF YOU LIKE HER TOO.. IF YOU LIKE HER TELL HER...|`|GkHFLQigaa	i think she does because that's major flirting and she uses this other guy as a way to make you jealous and make you see her the way she sees you.|`|Xufmci0naa	i agree with him she wants 2 make you jelous |`|t8da50qlaa	She flirted with you, yet told you she likes someone else?   Don't waste your stress on her, man...unless she doesnt know you like her. Then...i'd at least tell her you like her back, that way she can maybe tell you she was just trying to get you jealous and she liked you all along.    And to answer your question, it varies with every girl/guy.   40% guys/girls on the earth mean what they say, in my opinion...that's why a good soul mate is so hard to find.|`|62P5ouqOaa	Girls say a lot of things that they mean and a lot of things they don't mean. I am not trying to be of no help but girls are confusing in general, I should know I am one. I would say she either likes you since she is such a flirt, or she just likes the attention you give her when she flirts with you. Sometimes a girl just wants to feel special. But if you keep making her feel that way even if she didn't start out liking you I bet she will end up falling for you :)|`|ZTcJbzNNaa	No. EEWww. That's gross. But she proabably likes u. Because I am a girl and I can say to my crushes face that I like someone else and not mean it.But if she did that then, I'd gues she really likes u.|`|Dl0PE7Wsaa	If a boy says something does he really mean all the time? I hope you got your answer.|`|s0LSD0Rvaa	Just take her to a private place, then tell her how you feel. She will most likely be obligated to tell you how she feels. 
LFi7Wkteaa	maybe he misses you sometimes|`|WEZygQBXaa	He's secretly not over you.      ...Or maybe he just didn't even think about it.|`|jE0oD9IMaa	maybe he does still have feelings - but then again maybe he just doesnt want to take the time to delete them either. Most likely though, those pictures probably represent good times you had together right? Just because you're not with a person anymore, doesnt mean the time you spent with them is magically erased. It still happened and it was still a part of your life. Maybe he wants to keep the memories, even if he didnt want the relationship anymore.|`|AA11584616	I'm sorry he was mean to you. Some people do keep pictures,etc... from their past, because it WAS a part of their life. You can't go back and erase it. I would think he shouldn't/wouldn't have them online though if he didn't want others to see them, and if he didn't still care. Not saying he will come back to you,etc...but he must still have some feelings for you or he wouldn't put all that out for people to see online.|`|3099b987d3a742398f764f6ed2489a31aa	so what your couple picture,this thing don't get disturb u or make u weaken. Just forget it. if u cannot talk straightly to ur ex-boyfriend. tell him to delete it. for me man is man like to make like he has girlfriend and other don't have one. it kind of showing off ok.|`|EoxAp1Jlaa	i would not delete them    he may recognize that he did like the relationship at the time... but it would not work anymore.     i kept pics of my with my ex up online...  he's like a brother to me|`|atTa8PFKaa	i still have some. but only because i'm too lazy to delete them.|`|ITNq8WU9aa	Don't ask me. I don;t know.    Did the relationship start off all sizzling and ended with a thump?    He seems to be a sentimental kind of guy. Did you always remember the day you met and your Birthday
ZzFeaEwCaa	Think of the weirdest situation or place and see if he goes for it. If he does go for it all you have to say is "just kidding, I can't believe you'd do that!" anyways...|`|m3ThrbDMaa	If he doesn't buy you a flower, or act gooshy around you, or want to hang with you every night after work instead of hanging with his buddies...    When it's love...    You know it...|`|NCGcY5VSaa	Tell him no sex until married.|`|AkhsVt7daa	If you are asking that then it was just sex.     Don't have sex with people until it is more of a relationship.|`|b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	Many guys do. They will look for someone who is easily manipulated and can't make real decisions for herself and who believes that he really cares and she will be so popular at school.....    Honey you will definitely figure it out as soon as it happens.|`|RjuciIbbaa	if he talks about sex all the time  |`|62HPCElNaa	have sex then see if de dumps u|`|HfyPZPxGaa	If you put out right away and he goes along with it.    He'll wait if he respects you.|`|yfHaNHfzaa	simple just check if he always tries to touch you no matters where and when,   
u21dJZetaa	No, I don't think he JUST wants that. Maybe primarily, but no more. Most probably he's rather lonely. As you say, "I was his first GF, his first sexual partner, etc. [...]"; he'll always remember you (and there's nothing wrong about it).     That doesn't mean that he's any more right for you than he was when you put an end to the relationship. Be firm; he needs somebody else and he must find her himself!|`|AA11099449	He cares enough to want to sleep with you. But that's no reason to do that. Tell him at this time you aren't interested in that and see his reaction. If he suddenly stops bothering with you then you know he was out for sex, If he still hangs around he may still have feelings for you and take it slow|`|zka26204aa	When he brings things like that up, just say, "Well that was in the past." and see if he will drop it.  It sounds to me that he wants sex.  Obviously, he is selfish because he treated you so bad in the first place.  I certainly would not trust that he has had some rude awakening and has somehow changed in a year.  Keep in mind why you broke up, and if necessary remind him that if he had not treated you so bad, he would still be having sex with you. |`|uKhe48Npaa	Men are pretty straight forward. If we want to date you and have feelings for you, we'll do just that. If we can get sex and not have commitment, we'll do it with a lady who we do not see a future with. I'm sorry if this is too straight forward, but it is the truth. There are no secret desires and such. We just do it!|`|wTt8QhgTaa	girl, that's all that he thinks about, even if he is your ex, that doesn't mean you can talk sexual stuffs just like the old times? and that's absurd if he tells his favorite times? huh? who's the guy in their right mind would talk about that with her ex? Maybe guy friends but not ex    Leave him for good, find a guy who is more suited than you|`|AA11626328	Why back track If it didn't work before.|`|JkTYCm1maa	yes, he wants to get laid.  while you were dating he wanted to get laid.  and before you met he wanted to get laid.  guys want to get laid all the time, regardless of current circumstances.  why is it so hard for women to understand this??|`|G3vSc6WEaa	well, may be he wants to get laid dont you? the thing is this, you could be friends with him and even close ones, that does not mean u will give in to sex. You can try, tell him u are not ready and that he treated u bad. his reaction will tell. And it is total normal for anyone to talk about their best momments, there is no rule of normalcy against that.
kYdoa4boaa	I can forget everything. Keeping things in mind is harder... but forgiving is not that easy. It means you give up all comfortable claims on a person that hurt you... really not easy. But with the thought in mind one wants it for himself, too... it is possible in my opinion.|`|AA10240683	Depends on what it is. There are a few people who did something to me that I can never forgive or forget.|`|D5N8s7weaa	Depends on what needs forgiving..........but you NEVER forget!|`|2qJ5r0sbaa	yes i always forgive cause if i do something wrong id appreciate that other persons forgiveness,we all make mistakes |`|CyAhfn88aa	If we forgot, we would never learn anything. Forgetting is not an option. Forgiving is very possible.|`|6b054418de556245f94b2dfff2404fa2aa	Anything is possible...Why not!|`|5QFVHGwSaa	you can always forgive but it is much harder to forget most likely you will never forget but the forgiving part is easy.|`|e1oky4jSaa	yeah I forgive and forget way too easily.|`|qc9u9UImaa	You can make the decision to forgive which is a conscience decision but you never can just forget.  Especially if it is ingrained in your brain.  We only have the control to forgive.  If anyone has the formula on how to forget.. I would like it.    a forgiver not a for-getter |`|tErwqaKoaa	easy to forgive,,but never forget!|`|pmAy7AURaa	It's not always easy to forgive and forget. Sometimes, it's the hardest thing in the world. Forgetting isn't a good thing necessarily, but I think it's part of forgiveness. You can't truly forgive someone if what they did to you is always in your mind. You have to let it fade.    I have forgiven a lot of things that I will never forget, and attempted to forget a lot of things that I simply couldn't forgive. It takes a very strong person to both forgive and forget, I think.|`|Bp2uZ5Hvaa	only the stupid don't forgive, but the smart never forget the lesson.|`|nC6qEW1Paa	Forgive but never forget. Forgiving is moving forward, putting the mistake behind you and learning from it. Forgetting is pretending like it never happened, allowing the opportunity for it to happen again.     |`|7qloglmjaa	sorry,but i can only forgive yet never forget.you as well have a nice weekend!|`|js5Q2TtRaa	i forget.....  i may think i forgive... but it isn't really true.  i often find again those problems in my dreams, and in my nightmares|`|qVmxDFJCaa	I can forgive but I think especially depending on the situation its important to not forget|`|CMQnJhodaa	I'm the person who can forgive others for what they have done, but when it comes to forgetting that is not the case!!    I never forget what some one said or did to me!!|`|uzOz4wOcaa	That's a very complex question and I can't give a global answer. It depends on th reason. Forgiving for the most things is possible. Everyone do some things in the life which are not good or correct. To forget needs a longer time, and I think to forget really completely for all time isn't possible.   An other thing I never can't forgive and forget is my friend (or husband) has a bit on the side. Than there is no chance.  |`|dItZAwI2aa	in my opinion, anything in a relationship can be worked out, forgiven and moved on from except 2 things: violence weather physical, mental or verbal and cheating of anykind.   as far as forgetting anything, i know of no machine that can remove memory so as the banners say, we will never forget.|`|AA11713693	Its easy to forgive but not to forget.|`|vXubuAqzaa	depends on what im forgiving and forgetting*|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Yes you can and i will forgive you for insulting us older people (deal)..lol|`|nA9pQZflaa	your (heart) in my hands.   You'll feel better when I forgive you.haha  |`|tDb3osk7aa	it depends on what was done to me if it was something very terrible it would be very hard to forgive and i def. would never forget.|`|RUD9XBVRaa	I believe that forgiveness is worthy of all people.    Forgetting, however, is not the wise thing to do.  Forgetting leaves the door open and allows it to be repeated.  We all need to learn from mistakes - whether we are the one who commit the mistakes or not.|`|yVIb7zjiaa	I can forgive but I will never forget.|`|TiEYTbmjaa	I agree it depends on what you are forgiving and forgetting|`|ghz5D5iLaa	It does depend on the deed. Cheating can not be forgiven or forgotten to me. Little things can. |`|Sicr0Mdoaa	I can forgive but I won't forget.|`|GTFIisKzaa	What about excommunicate.
uzOz4wOcaa	Yes, I'm. Cause last week I was ill. And now I miss some smalltalk with friends.    Also a great weekend for you!|`|Sicr0Mdoaa	not really.|`|7b6b76916c60127cc29dc1edf223addaaa	Yes im always talkative|`|9fAHd15Caa	no my throat hurts|`|jMJpFXkeaa	YES omg i am   its kinda weird.........|`|OcULHtEIaa	no.....    y cuz life sux and isnt fair i found out something sad plus im moveing to a new state not that i dont want to move im actually excited thats the prob the friends im gonna miss the most are mad at me 4 wanting to leave =(    but ill put a smile somehow =)|`|GJo3ergeaa	no|`|Gza74Grmaa	not really, im tired, had a late night :P   I might be tomorrow :D|`|P8xN2IzIaa	No, because I have my senior research project to do, and I barely have time to do anything.  Why am I on here?  I'm a procrastinator!  lol!|`|GeyFdO5jaa	No  i never feel like talking   You have a great weekend to..|`|cJwve90Gaa	Yes......isn't that what women do?            I hope you have a great weekend too!    Go do something fun for yourself and make it a great time.     TooooooLeeeeeDooooo|`|GTFIisKzaa	oh sure to distract me from reading my HW.|`|GdBjTovfaa	i drank to much jack last night and have the worst hangover ever, i will never do it again. i feel like someone is trying to pull my eye out my nose and punching me in the tummy with both fists.while slapping the back of my head with a 2by4.

tDb3osk7aa	my hubby complains sometimes lol says im always up here i do admit it does get addictive once i get up here its hard to get off.i just cant help my self its like chocolate one taste and thats it i gotta have more lol.|`|YNdKlKpdaa	Yes I have been told that many times, however I don't spend as much time on here as I used to, I have more or less lost interest in answers.|`|p0c4mek6aa	No they dont. I do spend alot of my spare time online though. It's better than being a slouch on the sofa watching TV all day I guess.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	No  im an adult now and not living at home but after i get all my work done in the mornings im on my computer  all day.. then i stop at 4 pm to start supper for my man and  i  after my dishes are done im back on again..lol|`|i62DZJFOaa	HELL YEAH! They get so pissed at me, but I when i pull up the 'homework' file, they leave me alone because its homework. Although I'm not actually doing it...b/c it isn't homework. And I spend about one full day on the computer as my average for a week...yes that is WAY too much, but its so addicting!|`|E4ESLpKNaa	OMG! yes! i spend atleast 4 hours a day online.|`|CMQnJhodaa	No they have no idea how much this Y! site takes up my time!!     I start at about 530 am and finish at about 10 pm!! but i do take regular brakes!!     I also look on other sites that keep me busy!!    |`|ce7ea7f83a5ba171eb4ef78c629b25a3aa	No - I work from home and have to work from the computer so they are used to me being on here.  I work online most of the day and then come off when the kids are home from school to spend time with them and then in the evenings if there is nothing on TV and the kids are in bed I might come online again :-)|`|Sicr0Mdoaa	yes! my mom and stepdad say that I'm addicted.|`|AA11151727	yeah my mum does...hmm about 3hrs a day.|`|RTydE7Kkaa	My family used to but then realised im not going to cut down, but my friends are on the same if not more.    So probably about 3 hours a day.|`|nA9pQZflaa	Sorry , I have no computer.|`|AA11713693	No they don't. I don't spend too much time on the computer. I have housework to do and the bills have to be paid and I have to pick the kids up from school. So as you can see I don't have much time on the computer.
TB5NAHwSaa	Well the girl I like doesn't feel the same way about me. |`|GTFIisKzaa	date? what date? did someone say I have a date? you're kidding? |`|Q5qEsvVAaa	because our relationship is getting so boring.   but that's not it. i don't believe in distant relationships, and we're both traveling to different countries soon...    :)|`|Sicr0Mdoaa	I'm dating nobody at the moment.|`|tXRV7Chkaa	I dont get this?|`|rr6T2OBAaa	have know idea what you are talking about  |`|AA11361233	Not sure if I have decoded your meaning my friend.

UTZC8dlHaa	I would get to know them really well before I concerned myself with their sexual history.  Keep your pants zipped up until you know them well enough to ask without being embarrassed.But, do ask before jumping into bed .|`|kPWGVeWhaa	nah...just make sure there is no possible way you could be related. |`|GeyFdO5jaa	Yes  its always hard these days cause no1 really knows where the person has been and with aids and stds  its  scary|`|tDb3osk7aa	well when i was dating i did want to know cause at the time i was a virgin and prefered that my mate was one too so we can share that special thing with each other and i did get lucky and i lost mine to my hubby which he was a virgin too.|`|Q5qEsvVAaa	i wouldnt like to go into their history so much cause its a waste of time and there are so many other things we could talk about without being embarassed.  as for the diseases they might have contracted, its must (to know). not a matter of just curiousity but a very important aspect.  you have to know just the things that will make a difference later in your relationship.      not like how he broke up with his ex. thats not as important, cuz we only date when we're grown enough; thus we can take care for ourselves|`|73yLP1WLaa	No it shouldn't be an issue. I'm sure this person was not a virgin at the time you met them. Everyone has a past and that's just what it is, the past. If you harbor feelings about someones past, then it might be harder to move forward. |`|sgRDJUXqaa	Only if they have any STDs or paid for sex.  As far as how many people, how good it was, when they lost their virginity ... I don't care.  Nothing good can come from me knowing that information, and it is personal to you.  We all make mistakes.  Right now, I am concerned for my own sexual health, so the questions I ask would be if you're clean and if you've ever paid a prostitute (or someone else) for sex.|`|7a4Lu72caa	yes ik for me i want to k if they have been done before and if they are a virgin i mean it doesnt rlly bother me if they did have sex before but it changes the way i feel about them more just cause ik that they didnt loose it with me|`|b86b601e857ab3f32e2405d77431eaccaa	If they have something I can catch, then yes.  details about their women, no.  why, because, I wouldn't want to go into details about MY past.|`|tMvWqGY4aa	no that's none of my business    what i would want to get to know is what kind of person i have sitting in front of me.|`|Sicr0Mdoaa	nope. well wait yes so on the wedding night I won't get AIDS.|`|AA11713693	If I am dating someone new then the sexual thing would not be the first thing for me. As a matter of fact it wouldn't even enter my mind on any date.
AA11099449	Tell him to get lost. You don't need someone calling you names especially not from someone who is supposed to like you.|`|nKmFO0wWaa	You just really need to get tough & leave this guy because the way he treats you is just going to get worst as time goes on....... to quote a movie "Run Forest, Run"|`|50tDtYIlaa	hes wrong|`|isjbh2dHaa	kick him in the balls!!!|`|anfDbPmXaa	oh my god he's overreacting.  guys would love to have a girl like youu.  srsly hes got some issues.|`|j7kdn0JAaa	u are wrong|`|OKZpO0dbaa	He's wrong. If he physically/psychologically abuses you....LEAVE. No one deserves that treatment. |`|GG90f0yxaa	Leave him...if he makes a big deal about this, then what will he do when something more serious happens? Think about it, this is trivial problem.|`|b513111aa3d16b8c4e5fd1ed4f27c4b0aa	And what the hell is exactly wrong with the porn.  Well, I'm for sure that he watches it.  Maybe this dude is under the false pretense that his girl is like totally pure as the driven snow.  I know that I used to want that of the girls in my life, only problem is I was totally off base and unrealistic.  It can be a heartbreaker to find out that the girl you treasure more than life, has a sexual side that doesn't include you.   Or that maybe in the sack she can be a freak.  Not too cool to some guys who want their girls to be inexperienced.  Problem is if a guy finally becomes a realist and figures that there is no girl that is the "pure ideal" then what are we left with... nothing pure in this world.  And that's a scary concept.  |`|DvJbysUAaa	To me he sounds verbally abusive and a lot like an ex that I had. I know how hard it can be to leave someone you care about but when the relationship is hard on you then you need to do whats best for you. I finally left my guy and though it hurt at first now I am happier than I could have ever been with the abusive one and I  about to be getting married. Someone like that wont change, even if it seems like it, that is always there somewhere beneath the surface.    By the way there is nothing wrong with watching porn or being horny or anything its just his insecurities about himself. Its completely natural and quite common for most guys to do so girls shouldnt be ashamed either. Even if you havent then know this has nothing to do with that. This has everything to do with him.|`|cG2mRxGKaa	break up with him or tell some one to tell him its over because i would if they were calling me a dirty whore and stuff!|`|KeEH2SzXaa	he sounds like an ***, i guess it is more acceptable for guys to watch porn than girls but my ex use to have like boxes of porn and i never really watched it but it didnt bother me that he did... and like you said you dont even really watch it so i think he is just being a jerk and he is defintly in the wrong|`|IEH1UGzQaa	leave him or prove him wrong seperate from him for a while and see what happens i found out my soon to be ex was watching porn and paying for porn on the computer and this made me so mad i felt dirty. so i know what your bf is saying he is really in love with you but wants you and that you should not be interested in that other stuff if you have him|`|Lg9ztZrlaa	you should leave him. he sounds like he doesnt respect you and who cares if youve watched porn? im sure he's seen porn too. |`|LcIDppzIaa	tell him EXACTLY how you feel  stand up for yourself hun  tell him if he doesn't start treating you better your not gonna put up with it no more.  you deserve better than to be insulted and ridiculed by him.  he sound like an a$$ anyways|`|0abc374239d1ab2274807ddc255daa8faa	I wish i know your age. but i want a tell you a FACT. he is an abusive person. 2 watch porno is a personal decition. m not saying is good or bad, but is your choice. and any body who calls you names, or want a judge u all the time is an abuser. You need to leave that relation ASAP. THE ABUSERS WON'T NEVER CHANGE, is the victim the one who needs the change. PLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE: CHECK on line for DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. you'll find all kind of info abt it. and you'll see u are in an abusive relation ship. I had been a victim twice, and just this week i realize it. and already going to counceling this week. Last time he bit me, even make me jump from a balcone..i almost die. PLEASE DON'T STAY THERE. is your life u r playing with!!!|`|cwDGGxZHaa	Ok... first of all there is nothing wrong with watching porn. Second, if he is mis treating you and hurting you, you should leave him. If he is this way now, it will only get worse with time if he doesn't get help. There are programs out there to help and you may beable to get free counceling. I think no matter what you do you need to see a councelor and maybe do couples therapy if you want to stay together. Remember, it takes 2 to make a relationship work. |`|rZhUcLFmaa	I'm pretty sure he's just doing this because it turns him on. I think depravity is good in a relationship.    If not... that's sort of pathetic. He's wrong criticize you for that.|`|S0uCKptBaa	He's a jerk, and wrong. You should work up the strength and leave, as long as you stay he'll continue the abuse. People that love you don't treat you like crap.|`|AA10185333	Well we're only hearing Your side of the story, so it's only natural for You to make it seem like it's his fault, which You're doing. But for all we know it could be him.      Ummmm bottom line: That's something completely stupid to be upset about.    Can't help You there. Sorry.|`|AA12166501	He is a narrow minded jerk. You need to get the guts to break up with him. Ask yourself if you want to continue being abused or do you want to find someone who will love you the way you deserve.
BCk6Yh8Xaa	because  in order for me to love someone else, i have to first love myself  im working on that right now, with my whole world being flopped upside down    Ella  |`|G7y4wOF3aa	I'm single because i like someone but i don't know how they feel about me. If you're not in a relationship it doesnt mean anything, just that you're comfortable with how you are and you just need some time alone or single. |`|FX8tFczfaa	im 13 & im just not ready, relationships these days are jsut for fun but i actuaally want the person to like me & the other way around :)|`|FVtJ6dKkaa	Just waiting for you to ask me out Athren|`|NzF7UaCuaa	I'm single because I'm too lazy and also wary of the dating scene.  I know it's a means to an end, but it's still intimidating.  I don't want to do online dating, so that leaves me with joining clubs and networking.  I haven't been successful with dates lately, so now I'm considering the online thing as the alternative.  |`|GjKMUIpIaa	im sort of a ***** wen it coms to girls and askin them out    Ive only askd out 2 girls in my life and been rejectd by both|`|TvsMn9izaa	i just dont care most girls i have in classes are so shallow. Its just annoying trying to find someone that can actually have me not hate them while im talking to them. besides that i keep to myself and im 6'5'' so i get unwanted attention.. i know its a paradox. |`|SPJnNHWFaa	hmmmmm, I'm single becoz I'm not a beautiful girl, coz I'm want freedom to do whatever I want and coz I don't have boyfrd, haha|`|ALHnUE99aa	thats quite simple to answer..... am single and so are a majority of my friends because its unacceptable to be dating someone however old you are here in india....there are in fact two kinds of marriages here: love, arranged....the first one is self-explanatory and the second one is when your parents hook you up with a guy you hardly know and you are supposed to make this marriage work no matter what...the first kinda marriage is widely dissaproved of cos usually it goes against the parents' wishes....but chill !! the new generation is all for dating but serious dating is only if ur 18 or older....(it is still dissaproved of though.. :D)|`|5axWdjiraa	Because everytime I like a girl, they usually find out and make some excuse like "you're a great guy but", "we're only friends", "I'm not ready for a relationship yet", "I don't feel we're right for each other" or the famous one "Sorry, I've got a boyfriend". The really annoying one which I had is "Sorry, I don't date people outside of my religion" and she led me on.    So yeah I'm still finding a girl who won't say these things to me and loves me as much as I love her. While at the same time loving myself and feeling confident.|`|ox4MdqcVaa	I don't know... probably cuz I'm shy :P|`|B1NuRCMRaa	I actually preferre to be single because I like alot of space. Most of the time when I have dated someone that other person wants to give up their life and live mine, I hate that. I want the other person to continue to maintain their friendships outside of us being a couple instead of being up my *** every spare second of the day. Its important to keep your lives seperate but enjoy the time you spend together without it becoming all encompassing. I also hate the suffocating questions ; who was that on the phone?, where do you know them from,? what took you so long?, how come you didnt call me?, why cant I come with you? ect and so on. Im looking to find somene that is confident enough with themselves to not need my constant reassurances. It is also mandatory that the person works steady and is capable of taking care of themselves. I dont want someone taking a free ride on me, (been there done that) I am very dutch. And they MUST READ BOOKS for entertainment, thats a deal breaker. I cant be with someone that gets all their entertainment spoon fed to them by the media. Most of my relasionships fail because a person can only fake intellengence for so long, eventually you see below the surface. I hate looking there and seeing only insecurity. I dont mind sharing my life but thats the key. you cant BE my life!! I also believe the best way to find something is to quit looking for it. I now have a 6 month rule cuz its hard for anyone to hide their true self for that long and I dont end up falling for an illusion or you pretending to be the kind of person I want. I also want to be friends before the sex so thats theres something to talk about after the huggin and holdin is over. I want a person that is enhanced by being part of a couple not totally lost in it.|`|8fd15187072edd67714126b669a84db3aa	i would say because you havent found the right person or some people just like to be alone now please answer mine click on my profile and look for my asked questions|`|h1lDGNp4aa	I'm bi-polar and decided not to inflict myself on some poor guy.  Plus I don't do well in relationships; a common trait of bi-polars.|`|c3V4PZYdaa	I am currently single because I am interested in this lovely fellow and we are hooking up and hanging out. :)   But we both aren't really serious enough to make it official yet, but I wouldn't do anything with anyone else.   The best logic as to why we aren't together yet but both have made it clear we have feelings for each other is... Taking it slow. If you rush into any relationship it normally ends as fast as it happens, just take lots of time to make sure you mesh well together!.  So single but taken! :D Whats your reason? |`|sTqfKpbraa	Cos he never loved me and I don't feel the same for anyone else now !    Even if he is not with me, I will keep the best memories with me forever and will never regret for being alone, cos at sometime, he was my very good friend and he still misses me,    i have done my part, I have loved him.|`|jVePFp8kaa	I guess cause I'm all alone here in my room. LOL. Feeling sorry for myself. And I feel like I'm gonna be alone the rest of my life...|`|Ll3Qt8Wyaa	quite simply, im ugly|`|yKKhBCd8aa	Because I've been hurt too many times.  Because I can't find a woman with the qualities I can't live without!|`|8wi2X5sSaa	maybe its because im too young to be in a relationship but that doesnt occur to me though, no guy ever asks me out, not that im complaining but its just that im pretty quiet and shy so i dont communicate with guys a lot and finally, i made a pact to myself that i would focus on my studies and not guys.|`|zQD2dlCiaa	Same as Ella    I've got issues of my own that I have to deal with first. If I get a girlfriend now, chances are that I'll spook her out or worse.  But I think I'm pretty much ready.|`|06c2b2bf8d25233ed0327b25ec9921e0aa	because I don't know how to get a girlfriend, I don't go out much, I don't party, I have Asperger Syndrome.|`|LnyEMVFAaa	im single coz i easily get tired with guys a lot, i dont like having an obligation to tell someone everything about me, about my day, or my future plan is im moody and very fickle minded and also a very stubborn one. |`|4Vi7e6ozaa	I am single because I got broken up with 3 months ago and don't know how to find a new girlfriend. I don't really meet that many girls, and most girls don't like guys like me because I dont have many friends, dont party and dont drink. I'm not a very outgoing person. 
gg5KR3Ycaa	yea maybe but just don't push to hard if he does have someone else in his life you don't want to make them mad at you   good luck though |`|2Pv0iUOiaa	He likes you as a friend, that's it, end of story.    He was up front with you & told you he was 'spoken for'  & you said that was cool with you, so be true to your word & don't go lookin' for love in all the wrong places.    It always gets icky when you mix business with pleasure, no matter how old you are - especially if you go out, then sleep with the guy & then you fight & then it's really awkward at work & it's no longer a fun place.  So keep it in your pants sister & find love somewhere else, with someone who's not already taken.    Good luck & have a great day, HK|`|iq4yIcJDaa	yep.  he's diggin you|`|Dj95axataa	yea hes a big flirt and is just testing the waters to see if he really likes u|`|KTMQ71fNaa	he doesn't like you, your just his friend.|`|2aa95dd256a9fdf563b23d4ae0e23415aa	It sounds like he might be starting to like you.  Find out what happen to that other girl he was after though.  You don't want him stringing you along.|`|zpZQGVVraa	i'm guessing when he says you should believe in yourself,,..listen to what  your heart says.. maybe his done with the other person|`|oMXZL8D8aa	He don't like you no more than he did a week ago. He just been cut off is my thought|`|ugRN86bYaa	He's flattered by your interest, but he's leading you on just a bit. I believe you could have him. My humble advice is be a bit cool; dont be mean or rude. Don't be anything at all. Treat him like a fly on the wall. |`|4TNavgDuaa	Sounds like hes falling for you. Maybe he just needed time to get to know you more.|`|Ww9G32dlaa	nope.. lol... i dont think he does at all sorry|`|wlY1UgQHaa	actually he does....whoever says he doensnt needs to shup up
fhO3V30waa	he deeple cares for you.  the question is do you feel the  same about him?  do you look deep in his eyes?  |`|aJVTMHDPaa	oh he likes you, if he stares into you that really means he likes you.|`|HD75mkRtaa	Aww, he totally digs u. If you like him(why else would u spend hours on the phone right?) u really need flirt more. He'll definitely get to his question then.|`|3bcbc8b9c682810a2f5f771d643ffef8aa	duh. he likes you|`|un2tHoQ6aa	he might possibly like you? |`|AA11099449	he likes you or he has a staring problem, but since you two talk I would say he likes you.|`|2f5004aaadf7a01e4b37d68d83883b80aa	Yeah I think he really likes you! He sounds adorable. Do you like him as more than a friend?    If you get the time please answer mine, its sorta like yours  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|O11iOc6iaa	If a guy talks to you and focuses on your eyes, this is a good thing. the guy is really listening to what you say and is not thinking of other things that could get him distracted. he truly wants to know how you feel and enjoys the conversation. And obviously he is wanting to tell you something when he says your name. I would say it is that he has feelings for you. The next time he does it, ask him what it is and reassure him that he can trust you with whatever it is and youre there for him.     |`|Unjx0VTSaa	trust me on this...he is just wondering if you are thinking the same thing he is. He adores you. he wants to ask you out, but he doesnt know if you feel the same way. tell him how you fell!!|`|633FfA3oaa	I was walking past a bench. I spotted someone I thought I knew. I tried to get a closer look, but when I walked past, I saw these ocean blue eyes, and when I looked, the depths looked endless.    It means you have nice eyes. (and he doesn't know how to express himself.  go out once and awhile).|`|x8PawLT7aa	It means that now is the time to start wrapping around your finger :)    Seriously he likes you. He obviously finds you very easy to talk to and trusts you with his innermost thoughts.    The important thing here is Do You Like Him as more than a friend?    If you dont you need to come clean with him otherwise he is going to get very hurt and you will lose your friendship.|`|VMbaRPQZaa	You need to ask yourself if you like him first. Then if you do...tell him you like him first and see what happens.|`|HJGgVvkvaa	Possible answers:  1- He has an eye disorder and does not blink.  2- He is playing stare game to see who quits starring first.  3-He likes you.|`|OqO8Xdsraa	it seems he is shy  to tell you that he likes you a lot and is scared to tell you.I believe he thinks he will ruin the friendship you two share between each other and so leaves it at what you two have now. It is a strong chance that is how he feels. :) |`|qrPveSK3aa	He probobly likes you OR he probobly has nothing else to do =]|`|IqDfZYQ0aa	It means he is attracted to you. |`|qtWOBm5saa	He is looking to see his self in your eyes. It sounds like he likes you but he is not sure if you like him. You need to tell him if you like him or not is what he needs to know.
tA27prVhaa	he does like you, but hes a guy.. hes obviously a very confused male lol.    he wants sex also but thats just a guy thing..    he likes you alot, and he finds you physically attractive... is there something wrong with that  ?|`|tk4QaDeLaa	it depends. if he did this with someone else he probably doesn't like you. but you never know...|`|jGQiNeq2aa	yeah ask him out      unless of course he repulses you|`|v1g6DopXaa	he is nerves around u |`|hfIXzmfuaa	MOST DEFINETLY LIKES U!!!

Trust me I have been there. I was in a relationship like that. And now that I been married to a different wonderful man for 6 years I realized what type a guy I had dated. Don't fall for his "player" games like I did. A really good guy will respect you not grab you if you aren't even dating! And believe me, a player will seem like he's prince charming. That's part of their game! Just be careful, no matter what you choose. And respect yourself enough to know that you can find a better guy than that. Just be true to yourself and what you want in a boyfriend.|`|AA10953937	If you have to ask, you already have your answer.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Sounds like he's obsessed with you and good grief.  I wouldn't tolerate all that hugging unless I really liked him a lot.  You could report him to the dean or someone.  He probably does want sex but whether he likes you for you, don't know.  He's acting stupid though when he comes up to you and talks about anything that's not important.  He needs to get a life.|`|3f3ad3990a7e27462986bdcaf4e4a684aa	i'd say its a crush.|`|di6p10Ifaa	he just wants some, grabbing your hiney, come on, he has no respect for you if he has not even asked you out and he is doing all of that. The only man that should touch you like that is someone you are in a relationship with.|`|WbYXKmFVaa	He justs wants some. He sounds like a smooth talker.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	He seems to be an annoyance.

Guys who are completely interested in you will make an effort to befriend you, and spend lots of time with you every day.    If not, he might be sexually attracted to you but not emotionally interested in you.|`|AA11007320	it seems like he realllly likes you.  ALL boys want some.   but it looks like he likes you for you, also.    how cute :D|`|c26NV1Obaa	OK take this. He really likes you ALOT no joke and then he will want some about 2-8hrs after he gets with you.|`|lNpEYsQDaa	youre going to be pregnant at age 16!:)|`|yQD6rmhgaa	he wants to sleep with you|`|tgtcSOexaa	Liking a girl and wanting to get some go hand in hand.|`|b84cd0a4f289482a5159e15d0eff0414aa	He wants some DUH   "ALWAYS HUGS ME ALMOST EVERYDAY REAL TIGHT AND FOR A LONG TIME AND STARTS ROCKING WHILE WE'RE HUGGING" (thats a way to get a cheap feel.)|`|LVfO96iTaa	wants to sleep with you and kinda likes you |`|7Ggu3cw2aa	All I can say is just ask him. Different people have different attitude. Maybe he's just like that. You can't just assume. ASK HIM!!!    Anyway from the look of things, I'll say he's a big flirt. He of course wants some. He likes you a little bit but he's thinking more about getting some.    |`|WkZd6jwxaa	Well looks like he is certainly interested. He pays you a lot of attention. But all guys are out to get some.That's their whole plot to be super nice until you give them some. The day after that they take an total 360 on you. But then again if you put it on him good enough he'll be back. So the question is "Do  you have that Good Good?" But real talk don't rush into anything.
4R1IgyDraa	some people are very insecure. they cannot handle being alone, b/c they think they have no value unless they have that "someone special" by their side to boost their self-confidence. so when that person leaves, it's like they have to hurry up and find someone new so they won't feel the pain. some people have all the luck and can find "love" quickly, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they are truly happy.|`|rZhUcLFmaa	The same way some people are just naturally more social than others.    It's just how they are born.|`|lH2UOet1aa	It's called codependency.  And it's rather pathetic...no offense to your sister.  It shows that the person more than likely has serious self esteem issues, and must be reassured by a 'significant other' that they are worth something. Jumping from guy to guy won't help, in the long run, it will just make the person miserable. Try to help her realize her potential, seeing as how she's acting could very well give her a bad reputation. |`|n8ry3Tnbaa	I've always been the same, it's like the new person makes you forget about everything with the old person. I hate being alone! lol|`|cO1BiUNzaa	Cause women are emotional creatures... They "need" and want to be taken "care of". Without a man who sill they turn too? |`|pwXpc6mPaa	It depends on the person, do you think she is really happy doing this? If she is then let her get on with it. Some people never can settle down, and enjoy this way of life, I personally couldn't live like that.     You are your own person and this may not be enough for you either, enjoy just being by yourself,  and when you least expect it you will find someone perfect for you, it might just take a few tries.     Good luck|`|OPzH4ih0aa	I haven't been in a relationship in 4 years and I'm coping just fine. I'm making sure I've got all my own life squared away. Plus, a relationship is a job I haven't always been good at. Girls today are high-maintenance. At least in America they are. I'm trying to finish school in the hopes that once I do and continue blooming, they'll all be lining up.|`|DXs38q9Haa	They don't love themselves if they can't be by themselves|`|IOvB1cXkaa	well sure people can do this but think your just wasting your time and your not looking for your true love just loo for someone and i dont think you e=want to be like that cuz i know i dont|`|qFZgzIDBaa	it's called being a **** don't do that or you'll reputation is screwed   answer mine please   do you think I am cute?   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|gKzr7pNMaa	Some people simply can't live alone, or can't stand being alone.  I've always thought if you can't enjoy your own company, you're in pretty sad shape!  |`|nuCO02c6aa	maybe they just know tons of people who would be interested in them?  it's possible...|`|oiFZFGR3aa	IDK.... cuz I was just in a relationship for 6 months and the freedom that I felt after I broke up with him was RE FRESH ING. Made me not want to be in a relationship EVER. But now that feeling is waning and I want someone to share my days with.     So I can't bash her, she should be very grateful that her relationships aren't draining her. 
6kHyglzOaa	Even better.....  roll all "marriage and family protection propositions" into one....    Ban gay marriage  Ban divorce  Ban interracial marriage  Ban abortion  etc...    allow government to dictate religious values and choices      Most would be hard pressed to agree with all elements, and the propositions would fail, miserably.      One Man, One Woman -- 'til death do they part. So, by definition one must die before the other is eligible to re-marry. sorry, but that's what it says in your vows.    and a note on the movement toward theocracy and the Mormon support of Prop 8 in California. One might caution them to be careful what they wish for. If we are to politicize morality based on religious belief, we are a hair's width away from making those religions who are not about "One Nation, Under GOD" illegal as well. Last I knew, the Prophet is not God as has been defined by the popular culture.    so...    If you don't believe in gay marriage....don't have one  if you don't believe in abortion.....don't get one|`|NiIz9plhaa	Actually that is not a truly bad idea.  Hypocrites should not judge if they do not want to be judge themselves.  This is a good reason why not to be fully against gay marriage.  There is only a very few good reasons to get a divorce.  I do not know what they are, but I am sure there is at least one.  People should not get married because they want to get married.  It is like loving the idea of being married instead of understanding that only "death do you part".  You should REALLY know your future spouse before getting married.  Does "for better or for worse" means anything to most people.  My parents' marriage taught me alot.|`|67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	I agree. I also agree with Melissa Etheridge about how gay people shouldn't pay their taxes because they're not fully recognized as citizens with rights!! Even IF the bible says it's wrong (which is highly questionable due to contextual errors), isn't that mixing religion and politics?? Aren't we supposed to be guaranteed a seperation of church and state...especially since the government doesn't recognize an OFFICIAL religion? Therefore the argument that so may try to use that "the bible says it's wrong" is null and VOID.|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	Oh come off it, they don't give a DAMN about the "sanctity" of marriage... because, like you're saying, they'd've already done something about divorce and godless individuals who partake in the "sacred" institution.|`|nqcnylFpaa	i don't like divorce ether but i wouldn't ban it now look at this scenario what happens if the woman or man is in a abusive marriage and that man or woman gets killed by there husband and wife all because that person could not get a divorce you know i would be blaming you and your little group for death of a person.|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	Violates the sanctity?  come on, Divorce outright rapes the sanctity of marriage|`|WF085j2Daa	you got this one wrong dart its marriage that violates the sanctuary of divorce|`|H0aIuM5Xaa	NOT ME .

In some cases, divorce is necessary (i.e. abusive marriages, infidelity and other reasons).  Nice display pic, btw..*wink, wink*.  As far as gay marriage goes, I say you (not YOU you) love who you love.  I'm a big believer in "judge not, lest ye be judged".  You're so right...people with nothing better to do really DO have to make other people's lives miserable.  That's messed up.|`|E0uRBwWtaa	You're a GENIUS!!

Make them certain that without a doubt they cannot stand another minute with their spouse...|`|UP3GtmQPaa	When I got married, it was forever in my heart and in my vows.  But when your spouse cheats and is abusive, I believe in divorce. I begged my ex-husband to get therapy. I still love him and wish we were still together, but not at the expense of being abused. And in the bible, adultery is a reason for divorce.  Sadly, my ex chose to break his vows for a quick fix.    The Catholic church DOES allow divorce.  They just don't want to make it the rash decision that so many people use it as.  I am Catholic and spoke in great detail to my pastor about what was going on in my marriage.  He absolutely understood my position.    Here is a quick bit of information regarding annulments.  If you were married in the Catholic church, you have to get an annulment.  I was Catholic, but married in a Lutheran church, so instead of getting an annulment, I am getting what is called a Rite of Form.|`|vVywdFEDaa	I see your point and I think that you made a good point. But it doesn't make sense to say being gay is ok but you should put a ban on divorce because It's against Jesus' teachings. The bible also says that men that lie with men is also wrong. Here are a few scriptures to back that up.  1 Cor. 6:9-11,it comparing men who lay with men with idolaters and fornicators. If it was OK to be gay don't you think that your parts would fit better together.This is not a perfect world, and people don't always do what right. I mean should we give rights to child molesters because they  enjoy sexual contact with children? Just because you have the desire, doesn't make it right. You can pick and choose what you want from the bible. What it comes down to is that man can not rule himself. Just think what would the world be like if everyone did what the bible told us to do.Do you think that there would be war? And crime, and people getting raped. There wouldn't be sex without marriage so abortions would not be an issue.But there has to be something more to life that living in this world the way it is right. That is brought out in Rev 21 3,4. If you are truly interested in an answer to will look in your bible, and read these scriptures. If your not then you won't. |`|pfVVSIihaa	So what if the bible bans gay sex!! I don't happen to believe in the bible. I do however believe in the love that my gay friends have for their partners. Because THIS I have seen evidence of.    I have also seen terrible things happen because gay people are not offered the protection of married people...even when they have been together for 50 years. this happened to one couple I know when thje partner who had the health insurance discovered that he could not claim for treatment for his lifelong lover whio was dying of stomach cancer. More aggressive treatment may have saved him. A married couple, even if they had been married only a week or two., would have been able to access the treatment. But not gays. he died within months.    About 15 years ago one of my friends died of AIDS. His good Christian parents had consistently refused to speak to him because he would not renounce his lover and come back home to die.    His lover nursed this man for almost two years. He bathed and fed him, monitiored his meds, took him to appointments. He gave up a promising career in the design field to look after his lover.     They were dumb. They didn't do the paperwork on the house, the savings accounts, the antique furniture,. Because my friend was said to be doing really well. He would make it. But an opportunistic infection took him within 4 days of his becoming ill with it. We begged his parents to see him in the hospice. They would not.    On the day we returned from making arrangements for his funeral, the parents were at the house. They had changed the locks. They had a bailliff with them and a lawyer who had paperwork to say that as the house was in his clients son's name and he had died intestate, they owned the lot.    They got the lot too!! It held up in court!!    Now you tell me...is this Justice? Is it a good example of Christian love and charity?    Or is it the worst hypocrisy and usury you have ever heard of?    If gay marriage were enshrined in law, this sort of outright theft and deception would not be able to go on. And it happens all the time!!|`|532899a9f64759e9922e6c8ecbeaea9daa	My Friend, have you not paid attention to your recent lessons even if they are half speculative?    The suggestion a few years ago that Jesus Christ may be only symbol of a man that was plagiarized from a much earlier belief system would have infuriated me into a rage. An in depth and detailed analysis of the possibilities of the World Religions as explained in Zeitgeist offered salvation. For perhaps 2000 years, man has wondered the globe in search of the true and Divine answers to life's mysteries and if there is a 50% chance that this was all a creation that was designed to keep us in a perpetual search by an order coming from histories Piassed Religious leaders then what remains?     First, could it be possible? I cannot say but let us ask our common sense. (1) The Vatican has the only power on the planet to provide spiritual direction and their message cannot be questioned. (2)  The Holy Bible has never contained the manuscripts of Thomas nor Mary (Possible Mary Magdalene) by order of the Pope. (3) The message contained in the King James version of the book is considered the most authentic by the Pontiff.  An English King and an Italian Holy Leader? Additionally, a book that was interpreted with numerous misinterpretations as well as embellishments that were offered in order to produce a more fluid reading.    Not done yet. (4)  A man that is said to be in the continual contact with God Almighty as is the Pope and yet allowed to order the brutal murders of countless persons as in the Crusades and the Inquisitions. (5) A religious order that possesses more wealth than most countries on th planet, pays no taxes, offers parishioners an early payment plan for sins not yet committed, preaches charity yet allows World hunger instead of lowering the enormous wealth of the church in the form of giving to the poor.  And maintains "Divine Right" of ownership of all material, (physical, Mental, Emotional & spiritual) historical connections to God...4 ever. (6) Occupies land that was provided by believers wishing to praise their God. Land that is covered with Pagan symbolism and that stands as 1/3 of the world rulers by decree.    {See:http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...    With that 50% comes the fact that the same story was told many lifetimes before those found in the Holy Bible should leave only one thought in your mind.  Unfortunately, I have trouble leaving things to chance plus I am terribly opinionated and so I'll fill in the blanks. Not as a lecture but with an example. Mark Twain was one of America's great writers. Wouldn't it have been terrific if he had ben alive to give us the story of Forrest Gump? Now that would have been memorable! Even so, he gave us Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer but managed to teach the world many lessons along with a bit of excitement, danger, friendship and to accept the punishment for what we had done wrong.     The only thing missing was a Deity. I am confident in my relationship with God and by nothing less than Divine intervention have I managed to prevail when others in my association have failed but still, I offer this point. With the exception to the Book of Numbers, I have read the Holy Bible from cover to cover on at least 2 occasions and I rate it as a phenomenal achievement. I can find nothing in any ounce of the sense that God gave me to base my entire life on the written words of a literary compilation that was written by a man.  Even granting every single word found in the Gospels as the truth still reveals an interpretation by each man.    To use an analogy I used earlier today, "If stung by a bee...count on the rest of the hive to act accordingly." Translation : If it isn't a 100% guarantee then you are God's personal vessel for interpretation and he ...or possibly she will never frown because of what you hear. On a final note. I think you will change you thoughts about this supposed Pagan Religion after viewing the video but it takes aroung 6 hours.     By the way, a more appropriate statement has never been spoken as the one you...well tried to recite. I think it is:    "Judge Not, Lest ye be Judged. Amen.
IEVXdVO3aa	You may not know all you need to know. Girls give it up pretty easily these days and abortions are not necessarily reported to anyone, especially in Calif. Girls are over-protected by law to the point where they are at more risk than they know. Abortions are not done in hospitals and the documentation is crappy.

aOy01jFEaa	If ever I started a relationship with someone. Whether its romantic or friendly. Then when there is no reason for me to keep it. I will be honored to share with others whatever I can having that relationship. Unless it will not cause disturbances to others or with the person I am having a relationship with. Then most probably I will have to pay it with some or more discretions.   If what I can share will give good advantages or even just simply sharing it for some sensible reasons. I will never hesitate.  However, relationships are normally an open book. It's just simply shared with others specially with other relatives and friends. It is most probably  best if blessed with other's goodwill and wishing of wellness.

Then the one where there was mainly romance was hard for me too because I was intensely in love with him, mainly because of our compatibility but he had a problem in the middle.

It may be possible to stop yourself falling in love with an individual person for many reasons.

After a while, we texted constantly, talked on the phone all the time. Soon after, I started falling in love with him. No one has ever given me the feeling he has.

If you care, and it's obvious that you do, no matter what she wants, do the right thing for her.  Some men will prey on those that they find are weak or weaker than themselves because they have ISSUES, but that's no excuse and when it does happen, it needs to be stopped!! Immeditately!  Let your friend stay with you if she's afraid of what he'll do if apprehended or w/e you want to call it.  Find a safe haven for her.  Or, there are always "Battered women's shelters" usually in hospitals, but those aren't always the nicest places though, they do have support that she might need after a situation like that. Survivors of such things often times need a lot of support 24/7 that can only be offered at a hospital... But call the police or go to the station and talk to an officer.

Unless you wish to alienate her and lose all hope of help, don't interfere beyond reading up on what many of those issues are, then addressing with her which ones fit her situation. Together perhaps you can find a way to erase the ones that keep her there. Be prepared for resistance, as fear plays a big part in her staying. (loss of love, being alone, financial, kids, and even out-right threats from the man). Mostly, don't abandon her as "unsavable".

I did not say it was right just the way it is.  :)|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Because of fear to feel emotions are distrust, or having been unloved as a child.|`|00B394HBaa	They are ultimately afraid of any form of commitment...never knowing that commitment is the ultimate freedom of happiness.|`|Tnj7CmW3aa	usually ends in heartbreak|`|4dd9374df6045331049807f2de428a9aaa	They push it away before it pushes them away first.|`|333W9jeCaa	Afraid of being hurt, so they'd rather avoid it altogether.|`|bacb05bd60597224ee220647d82a3d11aa	People do that to avoid heartbreak and getting attached to someone because they think they might leave.|`|lOXqBBOwaa	I agree with the first answerer. Some people take love as a joke; I'm serious about love, but some guys I dated aren't. That's why I don't worry about dating guys or getting in a realationships because I don't have the time to get hurt anymore.|`|Tl0O09mvaa	either their afraid of heart break or there just not in to it|`|NdGJtk2Waa	Their afraid to be loved. They do whatever they can to get away. Unless their lucky enough to endear True Love before they get to scared. 
XRul2jFzaa	Walk up to her and kiss her.  Its the quickest way but probably not the best.... i don't recommend it|`|AA12074640	Just do it. Plant one on her forehead, for the first time. She won't be expecting it, and will have less time to duck. It's kind of romantic. If you can pull it off, kiss her quickly on the forehead, and as you pull away, look longingly at her lips. I'll bet she'll fall for it.|`|AA10591117	Grab her in the hall, lay one on her, and keep walking after.  Watch the left hook, though.|`|JwGS57jzaa	kiss her ***!|`|SPDG8pnSaa	Be Confident, Charming, Sweet , funny and GO FOR IT!|`|xHPyaXu1aa	A quick peck would be just fine    Guys answer mine too:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|J9Heg6Qiaa	hmm...quickest way huh...I may not be currently appropriate to advice you how since I am way older than you and things these days are somehow different from ours in the past.     But still, I have managed how to give you some tips.   If you're a natural born talented in acting then don't have to worry much.    Follow these steps:    1.)  You have to learn every information about this girl first before          trying to kiss her (quickly).            A.)  Don't go for a initial hurting reaction        type, not only the pain you'll get but embarassment.haha                 Most of these girls are the high class ones/the respected          type...they don't want to get touched that easily.          B.)  Aim for the extrovertive and fun type of gal.  This types are         the one who accepts other's mistake with an open mind...they         may get mad if it's unreasonable, but still be willing to understand          you.          People who are funny are optimistic people.  They always see         things in a positive ways...so your "execution" may succeed          compare to the high social type.     2.)  Observe where and know when to go for the "kill".    When things are in random like all of you are dancing in a party or something you could just kiss her by mistake, bump 'n' kiss then go"oops!" w/a funny laugh if she gets upset say sorry as if you really didn't mean to do it but never make her feel that you made these things up just to have a stolen kiss...    If both of you are alone you could kiss her quickly if you can make her think that she has said or did something that touched your emotions deeply...got it?     It's like you pretend that you accidentally kissed her all just because of what have she said or done...then go with the surprised expression yet looked innocent of doing things in purpose...you must act surprised yourself for what've you done!      Remember:  Know the girl. Know the time.  Analyze situation. Then go.     |`|KlqemMJAaa	The quickest? Just go it (like rape), but that isn't gonna turn out well. But that is the quickest way, (but not the brightest)|`|HbdBJb9Naa	just do it|`|q8XOw3jTaa	Tell her what you think of her using lovely words. Then ask her if you can have a kiss. It might be corny, and you may face some rejection, but a good woman prefers honesty and will respect that in a good man.    So sayeth the Ninja of Love.  |`|MPd34Ygoaa	Just grab the girl..  And kiss....^ ^  Simple and nice~~!!!
J1is8w7Iaa	What happens is he gets a phone book to stand on and then he looks her directly into her eyes and smiles and tells her how much he loves her. That is what happens.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I was married to a man 3 inches shorter than I was but I subsequently found out he suffered with LMS (little man syndrome) he turned out to be aggressive and full of angst. He is now my ex.|`|31edb7797d765f1300c12d8242a8f21caa	When they are toes to toes his nose is in it  when they are nose to nose his toes are in it|`|utJTwV2Haa	Ha. Sure. If she has a sense of humor, and he can take being called shorty as well!|`|64d77l4qaa	What happens is he remains single.|`|8ZUymjH2aa	No She calls him Shorty...    Duh|`|t0pZnrcEaa	nothing if man is shorter then female then he can have large space at bottom between two lags.|`|TbMBaKw3aa	well.....he's clearly blind if he calls her shorty  it's weird but it's not THAT weird  it shouldn't be a problem as long as the guy doens't get jealous of the girl's height|`|BYeLZUp3aa	slow dance |`|mzmNxEQdaa	 ofcourso nothing happen
h0fIt5RUaa	Hhaha yeah i know wht yu mean... Im puertorican. & poeple are always like assuming im mexican.... it gets annoying, cos like if i correct them theyre like oh same thing... no we're not illegal, (no offense mexicans). to get here we fly a plane, & were apart of US, but mexicans can't come here like that. So yeah but it is a difference. i don't alwyas get offended, but after a while, it can get annoying,|`|FXCoGD44aa	How the hell are we supposed to tell the difference? We don't expect y'all to tell the difference between Irish, Danish, German, Italian and British. Pft, we can't even tell the difference between our OWN races, let alone figure others out. Hey, I'm Danish and I don't get offended when people call me German... close enough.    We say Mexican because it's the largest immigrating group to the US right now. Not because we ASSUME that every single one is Mexican.|`|Chib4b8saa	It's sad that people just assume everyone with dark skin, dark hair and eyes are Mexican. My husband is Cherokee Indian and yes, he does look Hispanic and quite often gets treated poorly because people mistake him for a Mexican. People are just uneducated; I don't know what else it could be. |`|i0s3fAwpaa	I think i get your point!:)|`|HUPo9Fraaa	My friend is Colombian and people ALWAYS call her Mexican or Spanish. She gets so annoyed. I understand, too. Like, when people ask me (I'm of indian origin) "do you speak indian"  I think people are just too ignorant sometimes|`|ryOLDW2Eaa	I think they just don't realize that people who are from all those other countries (and other countries like Spain and Argentina, etc.) are hispanic too- hispanics can be of any race, they don't have to be Mexican-looking.  Latino is the proper term, I believe, for this- not Mexican.  Mexicans can be Latinos/hispanics but the converse is not always true, people don't realize that or don't want to admit they don't realize that.
O1IwHvMtaa	you're denying some part of your personality that guys dont like, im a guy and u sound awesome|`|MOsJUNWVaa	They may be intimidated by you. Guys like to feel superior any chance they get, and if they see a girl who is genuine and original that has the same interests as them, then they're afraid they can't impress you...|`|yb7FYX9naa	dont be shy.... alot of guys dont like that.... just laugh and smile and be real friendly just act like you want to be there friends and they'll be nice to you...    and texas isnt so bad lol...i live here and im sure your friend likes it too|`|emuIWGvDaa	Girl you just wait when you get a liitle older like high school...guys will luv you! ur still young. its fun but it has its downside. guys can be very annoying and well....just guys! ;) thats good that you dont care now. you'll def have ur chance.|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	No, your question isn't lame.  It's been a long time since I was your age, but I still remember how important it was to have both boy and girl friends.  My first "real love" was in 6th grade and it lasted about a week.  I had a girlfriend in 7th grade that lasted a couple of days.  Then I didn't have any special girlfriend until 11th grade.  That was a pretty lengthy friendship that lasted for a couple of years.    Needless to say, I survived all of that wanting a girlfriend thing.  Somehow it just magically happens that boy and girl meet, the chemistry is right, and love happens.  I've been married for 40 years now to the same lovely girl.    It is important for you to have both boy and girl friends, but don't lose any sleep over having a boyfriend at your young age.  Just enjoy life while you can - it goes by very quickly.|`|iLs2wdiNaa	well don't worry...    I'll be your friend =]|`|knIMtzwjaa	come back in 5 years and you will know the answer|`|aM1YxexPaa	Now, i may be a guy but here it goes.  You just need to stop caring so much, just talk to them, have fun doing what you do, and instead of letting them come to you, you go to them.|`|sZf09e90aa	u could just be ugly, i got a couple of curvy female friends but they're at least pretty. IDK you're probably ugly im sorry|`|VYBCC9vFaa	Idk I am literally in the exact same case like the age and personallity, but not the skateboarding.  Don't view them as guys.  View them as people and be friendly.|`|FjK6v56qaa	Im sure that if you talked to some boys, some of them would like you. I mean, ive had a lot of friends that are boys, u just have to find one that u have things in common with u|`|af4Fpnnhaa	Its A LOT of fun having guy friends!!!!! I have TONS!!!!!!!!! not trying to brag or anything though..... i guess it depends on where you live and what the guys are like. I live in Idaho and there are lots of nice guys here!!!!! :)    hope this help..... a little! lol! :p|`|Z6kjwFcHaa	I sort of have the same problem.  I am growing out of it though.  Guys are different creatures than girls.  They need people to reach out themselves.  They don't take hints.  They focus on girls wanting to be their girlfriends, not just friends.  Confusing?  Yeah.  But if you show them you're open to being a friend, and you are a fun person, it should change.  If it doesn't though, it's not that big of a deal.  I know everyone says it's so much better than having girl friends, but it really isn't.  Guy friends I have had seem to just end up asking me out and ruining it.  I honestly have one close guy friend.  That's all I can handle.  Focus on one or two guys you'd like to befriend, then work up if you like.  Just remember, friends are friends, regardless of their sex.    Hearts.|`|sveBTYSpaa	show them your fun side.. confidence is key so just say something funny and don't be afraid to have a big personality. what do you have to lose??    good luck! (:|`|DtF5b5vbaa	all the guys just havent seen your real beauty.    WAIT TIL LATER.    there is always somebody for somebody else.  otherwise meaning that you'll find him, dont try to hard. and trust me you dont want to get tooooo involved with a relationship. if you are still not happy try asking one of the guys out.  and there you go. if they say no just wait until later!!!!    HOPE I HELP!|`|wlY1UgQHaa	just be you and dont be shy go and talk to some guys from the "popular group" talk about everyday stuff or if u can...sit by them in class but dont go and sit by a huge grouo of guys at lunch if there is no girls there it makes u look like a slutty flirt (only sit with them at lunch if ur invited to)|`|pWUuYwO0aa	well try to be your funny self around guys. Because right now only you know that you can be fun. so be that person around guys. and dont be afraid to be yourself, just because your worried that they may not like you. You'll be suprised.|`|NoEphn1Aaa	sometimes its hard to make good guy friends  in 5th grade i made friends with them eaif u have things in common with some guys than talk to them about that.sier but i think its cuz its elementary school and w were learning our ways around the feild of friendship  sometimes it take effert, maybe you just need to talk to them more.  the problem i find with making guy friends these days is its hard ifu cant keep them talking or entertaned.  maybe u can think of some things u might havin common with some guys like tv shows or something and start off from there.|`|1ikqmFbFaa	lol,the best thing to do(if you have any) is to have some of your girl friends help you approach a group of guys,and talk to them for a while.  or get involved in a group that has some guys.  i know at most churches in youth,the guys there are very friendly,and easy to make friends with.  and if its the right youth group,they won't keep you out of their little circle.  oh,and i'll be a guy friend to you.  i am very nice to people,and give good advise on things.  just send me an add req.  it doesn't have to be too personal. just whatever you want|`|IqK0wcTLaa	I'm the same way. It's not because the way you look or act, well who can understand the male mind. Maybe try to be more outgoing and talk to the guys and try to make friends with them. Try asking them to the skate park. Good luck!
UzlkwSC3aa	Definitely don't give out your personal info to anyone, especially her. I think she saw your profile photo and got the hots for you (you are rather cute, but I'm married).     My opinion is that she's still a kid, very immature, so don't block her, just be like a mentor to her (like a big brother) and maybe you can teach her something about life (I'm serious), unless she irritates you too much, then in that case block her.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	 she sounds weird, and very over emotional about stuff that doesnt even matter.  i wouldnt give my full name to anyone over the internet either and especially wouldnt ever  give my cell number|`|AA11713693	I feel as though you should go and remove her from your fan mail altogether. I mean if she is going to do this to you then you shouldn't have her there annoying the living details out of you. What she is doing is violating your rights and you shouldn't put up with that. Nobody should. You have rights and what she is doing to you is wrong. Think about it.|`|wzpCMI44aa	Wow. Block her. "She" may just be someone trying to scam/con you once she gets all your information. Even if no, she isn't a good friend.|`|uG9tuIfFaa	keep her blocked.  She seems weird and is probably not worth it|`|NTUr0t3haa	Keep blocking her. You don't owe her anything and you don't even know her. I also suspect she has ulterior motives for demanding your personal info.    P.S. You're a good writer.|`|eMYOiim8aa	This sounds like she has an obsession with you and is now playing the victim.  Who needs that!  I wouldn't feel bad at all to block her.  She'll get over it eventually.|`|pZNoepb2aa	Edit...  No... wtf... shes a weird trying to stalk you she sounds like... I really don't pay attention to my fans or friends on yahoo :P|`|vZxC25hTaa	If she doesnt respect your ideas or believes then you're right why bothering being friends with her? |`|93b9efecd6ca82bff2f4e552457b1bd7aa	My only thoughts on this is Why would you want to stay friends with someone like that?    I would block her and say good riddance especially if you really feel she doesn't respect you. But, you have to do what you feel is right.     Good luck with your decision.|`|uWiuujfeaa	Haha... wow, how can you feel bad for blocking a person you don't even really know? seriously! you haven't even met her, so its not really gonna be that bad to block her!    lol  :)|`|M2zGQ0FJaa	SHES PEDO SHES A PEDO SHES A PEDO    btw SHES  A PEDO    she obsessively  is some 60 year women looking to lure any one the can into having rape sex with her and you should block him/her and never talk to him/her again|`|Q8YHZ5g8aa	Ha ha, um I would just leave that alone. She sounds kinda creepy.|`|AA10516122	i do not blame you for not giving out your personal information. i email a lot of people on here i never ask for things like that though. how did you break her trust? if you read her answers it is because she has not blocked her answers, obviously that means she does not care if people read them or not. i do not blame you for blocking her. i have actually blocked some people today for getting on my nerves about obama. this sounds like a person who enjoys drama. i would just leave her blocked. she is obviously enjoying trying to start something with you. |`|bhho4iiCaa	I hate to block ppl too. but given the circumstances I understand. I would unblock her and then try to tell her that you will try to be friends with her if she agrees (w/e) to quit bothering you(maybe a nicer word) about your personal life.|`|woqcQMfUaa	you talk way to much restate that question and more people will answer|`|qMv3lDpJaa	no|`|oboxmXBAaa	White wine is good for red wine stains.  Is that the answer to your novel?|`|68vju75baa	if you dont know her in real life then dont trip about it..  after all you never know..this person can be a child predator or someone trying to steal your info.    be careful!  and dont feel bad|`|VdXBq09Paa	LOL Those using UK addresses are mostly spammers and cons you will lose nothing but peace of mind if you give anything at all. use your smarts!!|`|pmu2thzhaa	Do not unblock her honestly she sounds a little weird and its probably just not worth it.|`|pd34OrkUaa	i would just block her and pretend you didnt ever talk to her, there will probably be more people you come across from other parts of the world, accounting you are so popular, some people in this world are clingy and over react.|`|tPOjGkkkaa	It hurts but sometimes you have to say 'no.' For her sake as much as yours you don't want to be a party to encouraging unwholesome behaviour. Live your life well. Don't let guilt rule you. You are honest and true. Be that.|`|AW75XPHCaa	Well i agree with you for not giving our your number etc.  I mean, she could be anyone?   seriously if i was in the position i would unblock her, because... its not like your ever going to meet her?  its just nice to have a pen pal right?  i mean, without giving out too much information, you could make a internet friend :)  sure you may disagree with beliefs and stuff, but i wouldn't worry about it... its not worth it, life too short!  hope this helped, good luck!|`|OnBJJV3gaa	She isn't really doing any good as keeping her as a friend if she gets mad at you for the smallest of things.  But I think you should do what you think is right even if it does bother you a bit and you hate to do it.|`|sbed5x26aa	srry but if she cant respect u or ur believes u shouldnt unblock her|`|KiNOfUBXaa	well lets hope she never finds this question haha.  yea she seems the needy insecure type.. i think it was best to block her because who knows where this could have gone..she could have ended up threatening to committ suicide or something if u didnt tell her your address...seems kind of unstable.    She thinks she's so smart it's kinddd of annoying..and i hate ppl that brag.   |`|1c1c439fe56efe474e40fa091b610abeaa	I think if she's going to be disrespectful, especially over the internet, you should just leave her blocked. Unless of course you're loosing hours of sleep over it ha, I don't think you really have anything to feel bad over because from my understanding you didn't say anything to offend her.|`|iDOpQs04aa	You are right to guard your privacy and you certainly don't want this person to have your address or call number if she's already driving you nuts online.    Having said that, you are the only one who can decide whether you should "unblock" her.  Sometimes our contacts can be those who enrich our lives in some way and sometimes we can enrich theirs and in the best of situations it will go both ways.  But sometimes there are people that we cannot maintain contact with because there is just too much negative involved.  I'm sure you'll come across others from the UK who you can get to know without all these hassles so do whatever is right for you.  One suggestion might be to unblock her long enough to explain to her why you blocked her and base your decision on how she responds to what you say.|`|1fec7aaf419429427f9ebb742bb679ffaa	Yes! Keep her blocked. There are alot of dangerous people out there and if not dangerous, just creepy. Just remember, Jesus is the son of God and is God also, not just a prophet like Muhammad. He also gave his earthly life for our sin so we too can be God's children. Muhammad or any other prophets did none of that, only Jesus,God himself. Take care. UR a good guy. 
sTxxYHp8aa	Working around and being around someone who you admit you are having a hard time getting over is a bad idea. You need to remember why he is your ex and avoid all contact.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I was in that same position before. Whenever I would think about my ex I would try to remember why I broke up with him in the first place. Also think about things that make your new guy better than your ex. |`|25I5WN52aa	That'd be a little dangerous to your relationship with your current boyfriend. If you're not over your ex, it means you still have feelings for your ex. What about your boyfriend? Which do you like more, your boyfriend or the ex?     "He's everything that I always wanted in a guy."    Then you wouldn't have to think about your ex anymore but it's okay to miss being with the ex because the good moments you shared with him together. If your boyfriend's perfect, you'll have to let your relationship grow longer. As it goes longer, you'll forget about the ex slowly. Takes time. |`|wL6wqwvMaa	You can't turn it around. Once you became lovers, the  friendship went out the window. If your current BF new about your feelings what would he think? Ex or current BF honey, you have to decide.....|`|pg1wqQNwaa	u cant stop thinking of him cause you still like him to much still, u need to either stop being friends with him or break up with your current bf and try to work it out with ur ex..|`|sgRDJUXqaa	You don't love your boyfriend; don't kid yourself.  He may be everything you've ever wanted and a great fit, but you do not love him.  Look deep inside yourself and you'll see that you love the idea of him.    I don't see anything happening with your boyfriend long-term, but if you want to stay with him and delay that, be my guest.  But until you get over your ex, you will never be able to fully love another guy.  The sooner you realize that, the sooner you'll be able to move on and find the right guy for you.|`|NmsBFeNJaa	The fact that you and your ex were on again off again means that you are probably secretly hoping that it will be on again. In situations like that there is really never any closure. If things had ended badly and you couldn't be friends, then you would most likely have no problem moving on. But it isn't fair to your new boyfriend to be in a relationship and still have feelings for your ex. Talk to your ex. Get some closure. Slam the door on the possibility of your ever getting back with him. If there is any possibility that you could get back together, then you owe it to your new boyfriend to end it with him. If your heart isn't in it, then get out.|`|ge1C7alfaa	Move to Utah and marry both of them.|`|CqHzPD1faa	dude....your a dork... |`|7f91ea2Eaa	Ignore him he should not be your friend anymore, he is staying close because he knows you want him|`|MCbU6YdEaa	He probably wants to reconcile. But if he wants to do more tell him your in love with someone else|`|2TAq6XO2aa	My ex and I were off and on for about a month... we would try to be friends, but in our case, I desperately wanted her back.  It ended badly.  You should think about why you like this present BF so much, if you really do.. Is he just a nice guy?  Nicer than your ex?  Were you and your ex a lot closer, like you connected better?  Maybe, you need to get back with your ex, telling your BF before it's too late, that u don' have as strong of feelings for him, or you may need to tell him you cannot be friends, because it's too emotional.  This would crush him, but it's better than the unhealthy relationship you two have.  |`|5PIVJJSKaa	I totally know how you feel! Im in the same situation!!  But the thing is when you love/like some one like that you can't just take it back.. its gonna hurt for a while and he'll be on your mind every second of the day. But you will move on... You always do. Just keep reminding your self of your new Awesomely Great guy you have and NEVER compair the two. your just asking for trouble then..  And for the staying friends thing. I think you should just leave it where it was... Its not gonna turn out good. You'll just keep thinking about how it was when you two were dating and you'll start wishing you had him back. and your boyfriend will figuar it out sooner or later. so just keep the memories but get rid of the boy... It's going to hurt but you'll survive. Us girls are fighters!|`|BTFrfj4xaa	All I can say is time.    I mean, two months is too little to forget about somebody, heck, you'll never forget any past BF's, but I think you should enjoy what you have right now, if he's that awesome as you say, then have a good time and live your life!!    I understand how you feel, I'm engaged now, but i can't stop thinking that my ex is hot, we work colse to each other and i get to see him almost everyday...with his new wife and kids   :(     He moved on faster than I did, and altough we never lost contact we stopped talking to each other for a while, I think it would be unhealthy  me thinking that we can be more that friends now, so i just keep it like that, love my fiancee and remember all those good times i had with my ex.     Don't ignore him, but i do suggest that you kinda keep your distance from your ex, it will give you time to reaccomodate your ideas about him.    Good luck!|`|JmMDRwIDaa	You said "He's a perfect fit for me right now"    Right now?????  That sounds like convenience to me.    You aren't over your ex, dump the rebound guy and don't date until:  1. You're over your ex  2. You're dating your ex again|`|eXYSLsC2aa	My advice is you just spend less time with the ex. I know it might be hard, but it is necessary for the healing process. Don't IGNORE him though. That would make things worse. Talk to both of the boys about it. Your current boyfriend will understand how you feel and may have better advice for you than I do, and the ex might surprise you and say something like "y'know I feel the same way." I don't want to get your hopes up, but I was in a similar situation. It turned out fine. My ex and I are still best friends, and my boyfriend even chills with my ex from time to time.    Hope this helps ;)    |`|eq6l4L23aa	its because he is perfect for you that you want your ex, you want something to be a bit wrong, just so that everything is not perfect. you want a bit of danger in the relationship |`|tfAIqNfYaa	Until you stop feeling the need to be friends with your Ex you will never get over him. Since you work with him keep the relationship on a Professional level and nothing more.      When ever you start to think of your ex send your current man a text or call him just to say hi.     |`|UMTNiCNgaa	i believe that once you really like someone, you'll always have feeling for that person. so it's normal that you cant stop thinking about your ex, u can't expect to be over him so easily and in a certain time frame.  but i admit it must be hard if u guys work together because u will always see him, which can mess with your head/heart more. and obviously avoiding him wouldnt be possible because u guys work together. but for the moment maybe being friends/buddies isnt such a good idea.  he should be able to understand, tell him he didnt do anything wrong, that u want to be friends but u need time to get over it completely and focus on ur relationship with ur boyfriend now. and the boyfriend u have now...are you sure u like/love him? maybe your heart is telling you u moved on to fast? or maybe its not, just really listen to what ur heart is saying. just because he's everything you wanted and a perfect fit doesnt mean he's what you need right now. i kno this happens to me constantly i like the idea of having a bf or i actually like everything about him, but deep down he's not what i want. so if u really do like ur boyfriend good just try to avoid talking to ur ex as much as possible until ur feelings lessen for him to a certain point where it doesnt bother u to be friends. hope that made sense...i think it mad better sense in my head. sorry

oTMYqeUVaa	Maybe she was afraid that it would scare you off if you found out she was a Single mom. She should have told you up front about her having a baby.  Getting in a relatationship with someone that has a child can be very difficult .First of all the dad may try to make trouble any time he can just for no reason . They will be time where she cant go out because of the baby. They are so many thing that can make it hard. If you liked this girl befor why does the fact she has a child change the way you feel .. Besides if you love her it dont matter .I have a son(step son) and I love hom like he was mine.Just talk to her and ask why she did not tell you. Besides you can tell alot about a woman by the way she take care of her child |`|CsqPn56waa	Thats DEEP man    gotta think fast now my friend|`|YE3hSY8Maa	Run for your life even though she wasn't forced to tell you about her kid to begin with and I don't think anyone should be forced to share anything about themselves before things get serious. But I can hear your hesitations and that's why I say to you RUN. If you said that you are excited that she has a kid and you love kids then I would have said something different but I am writing you based on your readiness and you are not ready for that responsibility. SOOooooo RUN for your Life!    And the one above me says you are shallow, I say you are not shallow you just know what you can do and what you cannot do and that's called self awareness!|`|VG4Bc2KLaa	ABORT ABORT, She needs a man and she might just be digging into u for some money.

I'd say she's getting the best end of this deal.     Do her a favor. Leave her alone. She'll be fine, and maybe you'll hook up with someone as shallow as you are.    - Stuart|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	Your move...your choice. If you can take it further knowing she has a kid, fine, if not, don't start what you don't intend to carry on with. |`|zzbOfTEjaa	What's so complicated about it? She has a kid. Maybe she doesn't have any emotional attachment to the daddy what so ever. Most women are self-conscience about telling men they have kids b/c some men out there are bad about not wanting to give a girl a chance if she does. Maybe she was going to tell you but nervous about doing so. Maybe she's had a hard time in the dating field. Don't make it complicated.    Another thing I'd like to add- Many people find that Facebook is the latest trend and put all their information on that site.|`|AA11099449	If you like the girl then it really shouldn't matter, And if it does move on and let her meet someone who will care for her as well as the baby.|`|yDv8ofMsaa	OMG!a single mother?let her to be alone & have a man for herself! these are in case you don't love her seriously,but if u think u r the man 4 her(i don't think so!)u can go on,it depends on urself!u will never change ur life bcuz of ur answers!  good luck:venus|`|YhJIKiqcaa	Forget about her :s She's a slut...

zzaScg0haa	That depends on how old you are, if you are over 20 it's not a big deal|`|1hciyvKdaa	It could be the difference of legal and not legal, and that is a very important issue. Besides that, it all starts wtih your own age.........doesnt it? |`|AA11984147	A lot of things are factors in this equation. One, if the man is three years older than the woman and they are ADULTS, there is nothing wrong.  If he is 20 and she is 18 - I'd hesitate a bit.      If the female is the elder, I might hesitate if the younger man is not an adult.      Try this one on - my BF was 20 years my junior! Today, I'm 55, he's 32.    Sometimes, it is not so much the age difference, but these two things matter - LEGALITY  AND MATURITY|`|8rLH4YNsaa	i dont think its bad at all :)|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Bad? What do you mean by "bad?" Age difference is a neutral, objective status. It doesn't mean anything in itself, so it is neither bad nor good. A lot of other things are more important: like everything.|`|1poSSvTdaa	Depends - 14 and 11 - huge.  17 and 20 - not so bad  30 and 33 doesn't matter at all.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	its just a number|`|lxWNHW7Baa	i've heard of 5 years or more in difference(happy ones) right here on yahoo....carry on|`|AA11099449	can be a legal issue if your under 18 and he's over but love conquers all.|`|pRF5LLloaa	if it is 14 and 17, it makes all the difference in the world.    if it is 30 and 33, it doesn't matter.

I'm on the same page as you!!!|`|MdQZDQcraa	there just playing with u guys! hehe nice!|`|XhWoAGYAaa	nope|`|GUUa1s6Laa	Before I read your question I could answer No because you can never generalize all girls (all guys, all people of a race etc) in the same way.    No they don't. Your girls are just playing hard to get. There's nothing really for you to do but wait it out. I can only assume how old you are but it sounds like the flirting patterns for your age.|`|8JUTi5L5aa	i think she is toying with you haha maybe she is flirting for fun ya kow? dont worry haha just try flirting with her first ya know |`|ZTcJbzNNaa	Uh, there's not much to it.

Good Luck!|`|WXFxZubTaa	Maybe she feels insecure?  Sometimes girls may feel encouraged by a boy and therefore they act on that encouragement. That night they may doubt it. Doubt whether anyone would like them, whether they are pretty enough, whether the guy is just being nice, whether she is thinking too much into the situation.  Tell her how you feel. Tell her she's pretty, if you think she is.  Encourage her.    she's not trying to mess with your head, she's probably just confused and doubting the situation and by not flirting with you the next day. She might be trying to bakc off in case you are not interested. If you are, let her know. Carpe Diem!|`|7QZa9YlLaa	:) u must really like this girl to fuss over something stupid like this. i dont mean that in a bad way. i think its very very sweet :) girls arent the most boldest creatures in the world you know. u have to give them time. shes probably really nervous around you 
hRL4WtDhaa	There is nothing really  you can do to solve what you did. The only thing to do, if this really bothered you, is to promise yourself never to do it again.    As a man I will tell you that most of us only watch it for s temporal entertainment, but there are some that will record it and show it to their friends as a sign of status or even post it on internet, but its impossible to know what kind of guys they are, only you know (I hope) in any case, men don't think anything of this girls beside ohh she is hot or stuff like this, and we wont remember the face or girl (unless is a well known porn actress) so ppl who have seen you are VERY unlikely to recognize you in the streets, and eventually it will be forgotten since other girls will occupy their minds.    Also you parents wont know, unless they actively look on internet for free porn of web cam girls or stuff like that (which lets assume they don't)    But from now on, don't be hard with yourself, think of it as a lesson to learn, you wont cause a nice impression in men, you will create physical attraction but no EMOTIONAL attraction, we dislike girls that give so easy and behave slutty (of course we physically like them cuz that turns us on, but makes us also to loose respect for them) so instead I will suggest you for the future, be suggestive but not explicit, sexy if you want but not sexual. Many men are VERY good at persuading girls, so be strong.|`|abx5VNsOaa	lesson to be learned for all of us,they were strangers,probably won't see em again,put it down to a wild night,one for the grandkiddies when you're older.Forget it.|`|AA11984147	Repent and sin no more.  That's all you have to do.  When you are forgiven, satan will try to bring it up again and again, but you have to take charge of your mind and realize that what you did was wrong and just don't do it again.     Never look back. |`|Qo5vSDEdaa	i would do it again so u dont feel so bad about it|`|XyQ5S2Jeaa	Talk to your counselor at school or talk to your best friend or someone you can trust.

If so, forgive yourself and just learn to take things slowly.|`|AA12101680	Don't do it again! Period! Especially if you're under age. You'll get them in trouble and some people will think bad things about you as well! Not a good idea for a young lady!     The other answers are good too! Hope and pray they weren't recording it! Most likely, they won't see you again, if you don't show yourself to them! Don't do it again!|`|IUsKNjZVaa	well candy what you should do is forget what you did|`|AA11943537	Well at least you feel bad.  Don't do it again.

Good luck.|`|OORxHC3Saa	as long as you realize how stupid you are, forget about it.  there is nothing you can do about it now anyways.  if you would feel better telling someone tell your parents. maybe you will feel better after you have been punished.|`|zrdai2s7aa	You say you regret it...  And yet you did it in the first place.  Something made you want to do it, and it's not Satan, Sin, or anything horrible like that.  Sounds like you want more attention in your life -- but stripping on the internet is clearly not giving you the kind of attention you want.  Why don't you try to get more involved in regular dating?  Maybe you have some social phobias you need to work on, or maybe you have self-esteem issues...  Try and figure out what led up to this in the first place, and it'll make it easier to keep yourself under control in the future  ;)

Although one can't say for the tall person, they, themselves, may choose to date someone taller, but it's like i say...    "we pick and choose who we marry, not who we fall in love with".

G7rTH5Pmaa	My significant other is pretty conservative. So when she went to a sex toy party with her friends, I wasn't expecting her to get anything. Well she did. It's something that she can use on me though. Let me tell you, it feels great and it was so sexy that she was thinking about me instead of buying a vibrator for herself. Just because I know you're probably curious, the "toy" she got me is like this fake vagina. Hate to say this but, it feels better than the real thing.|`|yo97gApHaa	He gave me a D*** in the box for Christmas. That's provocative isn't it?|`|Zuiq2283aa	Wake me up in the morning while giving me oral =) wish I could wake up like that every day, lol. And the sexiest thing I've done for him would either be a striptease, or getting an entirely see-through sexy nurse outfit to surprise him after he had an operation.    x

PEACoHOZaa	i support gay marriage. marriage between a man and a women is a religioius thing and not everybody is religious. if they wanna get married, go for it. they deserve to be happy just like everybody else. "oh its a sin! if u are gay, god is gonna send u to hell!" give me a break, people like like are gonna go to hell because they are selfish and think they can tell everybody how to live their lives. |`|N7UCCGDDaa	support it. marriage goes back all the way to the beggining of time. God made Adam and said it wasn't good for man to be lonely so he made Eve to be with Adam. this is the way God intended for marriage to be, and that's how i think marriage should be defined........  from a non-biblical perspective i have nothing against gay people, they have rights  just like everyone else, but really being married just means you have the marriage license, if you're with the one you love than it should't matter if you're "married" or not.|`|Zv8dTjp0aa	i support gay marriage. there is no evidence to support they gay marriage is wrong, i don't understand the other side.    i mean if they think marriage will be destroy well its already happen look at  people getting married when they just met, teen ale to get married with parent consent, and with divorce its an easy way out|`|uVVzr8SZaa	I have yet to have a single person explain to me how a same sex relationship will DIRECTLY and personally impact any heterosexual marriage?  Seems if you truly concerned about the "sanctity of marriage" then the admendment would be outlawing divorce or adultery.  It should be clear that this issue is based on hate and has nothing to do with "protecting" anyone's marriage.|`|So57WgTqaa	I support the proposition! Against gay marriage|`|yyZMv7haaa	I think any law that discriminates against a persons right to live their life as they want to as a great tragedy.  As long as no one is getting hurt, what does it matter if 2 consenting adults behind closed doors are doing?  It's hard enough to find someone in life that you can be truly happy with, and if someone of the same sex is who makes you happy, then fine.  Us straight people can't stay married as it is, so where do we get off saying that a gay couple can't get married?  Don't know why our race seems to need to hate something.|`|DYJUdq08aa	I am for gay marriage. I am so straight as a board, but who should tell you who you can or can't love. You should marry who you love wether it be man/man woman/woman or man/woman.|`|108dd144b67a8cb2a13f084607bb9925aa	By Angela's thinking, since marriage is just a piece of paper, it would apparently be reasonable to create a law undoing all of the marriages throughout the world, because the people will still love each other and the license was just a formality.    The issue, to me, is simply this.  If gays get married, it IN NO WAY affects straight people.  The day after gay marriage laws pass, the straight people will wake up married just as they always have, to the person they love, and nothing will have changed.  The only people who will see a difference are the gay people who can now enjoy the same rights and responsibilities that marriage brings.       So, if your against gay marriage...it's simple....don't have one.  Otherwise, it's really not your concern.|`|6000d91555c1cc5fdf3a6512c8fe78b0aa	This is a civil right issue and therefor should be left in the hands of the supreme court judges we trust to interpret and enforce the constitution. Those judges already said that it was unconstitutional to ban gay marriage and if prop 8 passes then they will hopefully uphold there ruling and over turn it again.     Read your voter information guide get the facts then vote in favor of freedom and equality for all and educate those around you so they do they same.  This should never have gotten on the ballot in the first place.  Stop the hate vote no on 8|`|ARCbz9oSaa	NO on prop 8    Marriage has not always been between a man and a woman, on the other hand Christian marriage always has been.      There are records around the world in several cultures that there were same sex unions/marriages that occurred.    in some native American tribes gay marriage and unions occurred    also in ancient Japan. Male Male love was considered the purest love.    Melanesia and in Papua New Guinea, before the introduction of Christianity homosexual relationships were the only recognized relationship    In ancient Rome gay marriage occurred. *during Nero's time. "The fact that marriage occurred between two men among the Romans is proved by a law in the Theodosian Code from the" - the quoted is from wikipedia    in china and Greece it occurred mainly for guidance and was a temporary relationship usually.    Plus there is polygamy happing all over the world and in several Christian sects    so marriage only between a man and a woman is a endorsement of the Christian views on marriage which is against the separation of church and state.|`|r0Gy0ovJaa	I'm voting for prop 8|`|4ZaAZgCgaa	I'm against it.  First of all, how would you people that are for this proposition feel if the government said that you're not allowed to marry the person that you truly love?  Secondly I think all people should have the same rights.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	I am against Prop 8, for gay marriage.  Marriage is a civil institution which allows spouses many rights that are not available to couples in domestic partnerships or civil unions. All people deserve to have the same government-protected rights whether they are in a life-long committed relationship with a man or a woman. Also, civil unions or domestic partnerships are not sufficient to ensure that people of all sexual orientations are guaranteed the same civil rights. The Supreme Court wisely decided that separate is inherently unequal, thus civil unions/domestic partnerships cannot be equal. The fact that they are separated is a badge of inferiority. Many religions recognize marriage as a religious institution in addition to a civil one. However, churches may choose which couples to marry. Also, straight couples are able to marry in a civil ceremony even if they are not religious. This is because the United States does not have a national religion; there is a separation of church and state.   
O7vNfvs8aa	Good question! It's not always easy to know if we love someone. Generally speaking, love is a strong caring for someone else. People demonstrate love by being there for each other, solving problems together, sharing hard times as well as good times, helping each other grow, and by being patient with each other. Love isn't the same thing as sexual desire. Sexual desire is a strong physical excitement and attraction. Sometimes people confuse sexual desire with love. People can love each other, or have sexual desire for each other, or feel both love and desire for the same person.     |`|gI3OHG6faa	you don't. in the end, no one knows if they truly love someone, they just think they do as its defined by society and things they read in books and see in movies.that's half the problem with love today,becausegirls watch these sappy movies that someone saw on tv and think theres a perfect guy out there for them just waiting. it  doesn't work like that, but i digress.   if when you sit down at the end of the day, and think about things in your life, not just one thing, everything, school and or work, stressors, pains, problems, issues, if all thats floating around your head and see that one person,well then i guess your in love. It works like this, if when considering all else, if that one person is high above all else, then its the most important thing to you, and its the one thing you love. It cant be defined in terms, becuase only you know when you love someone, only you can find out, and it may sound corney, but i recomend you start by looking inward, and at yourself. decide whats important to you. |`|l2323mBlaa	Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant,  does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.   Love never fails; |`|z0fiwI04aa	think of what you can give up for the person, do you with like being with the peron everyday and do you feel happy when you see the person?|`|vxtwDKK7aa	I made the awful mistake of mixing "love" with "in love." When you love someone, you love them as a person, they're cool, you kind of feel secure but stuff is missing that would make the relationship work. I met the love of my life and he had everything that my relationship that I thought I was in love was missing. He made me laugh, I couldn't wait to talk/see him again, he had the inane ability to make me laugh even when I was upset. He made my day brighter just by being a part of it.     In short, you just know. Love is really what you and your partner make of it. |`|TcVU3fpFaa	love is something really hard to explain, so lets start right at the beginning; crushes.  A crush is split between love and lust. Lust being a sexual desire towards the person. The crush is a big time when you can work out love.  For example, I saw this guy for the first time, and thought he was the most ugliest person in the world. Then I met him personally and he became perfect in every way. This is love.  not a basic thought of "he's hot", like most crushes are towards famous people.  I'm sorry this is not a very clear answer but love is very hard to explain. If you look into google "How do you know when your in love", you should find a couple of articles giving very clear answers.|`|tjMcBAtAaa	You don't know what love is until you are actually in love, and trust me when I say you'll know it when you feel it.|`|LB9TPDWGaa	no one can actually tell you if it is or is not. Its just something you feel yourself. the only way I can describe it is when you would do anything for them, and i mean anything. they make you happy when you are around them, you don't even have to be talking (just their presence makes you feel good) but in the end its only something that you know, and no one else.|`|OznTidKOaa	love is a hard thing to describe, you just know. if you have to question if you love them or not, i don't think it's love. thats just my 2 cents though.|`|44d82c3d3d59a27025281e5a6fe7c890aa	You will feel what love is when it happens,  You will think about that person all the time.  You will miss them when there gone  you crave them you want them  you think about your future with them  you would do what you could to spend time with them  you might find yourself singing love tunes in your head   and find yourself smiling to yourself, just enjoy it babe xx|`|2m5IlRXKaa	when u can't imagine life without out them.

You have your whole life to have sex, don't make things complicated now.|`|6ZKYrlQBaa	It isn't that important to have sex with your girlfriend.. aslong as you are both ready then it doesn't matter... having a sexual relationship just creates more exicement in a relationship and you get to know each others bodies better... thats all really... but having sex may bring you both closer together...which could be good if you are in a serious relationship as it could strengthen it.  |`|QX0razxlaa	well, if you have never had sex before, go slow. you want to make sure above all that your first time is with a girl that you love and you want it to be special. many consider staying abstinent untill they are married. it's not important, if you love eachother that should not matter if you are having sex. the bond although is strong, you are giving that person your virginity and you cannot take it back. |`|7QZa9YlLaa	how old are you? if your like 18 or 19 then ur less likely to stay in that relatioship for more that a few months so its not that important when your young. however, if your like 30 and u love this girl and u want her, i recommend you do it :)
YfwNdsA9aa	"Sorry, I"m just not interested in you like that. Sorry!"    Look him in the eyes so he knows your serious and you know he heard you.  Then wait for him to respond.

Because you haven't already, he probably thinks you want him to keep asking.  Be honest, adult and firm.  Or keep saying "I have to wash my hair," etc., etc.  And he'll keep right on asking.|`|5qkjA7awaa	Honesty is the best policy. If you think you want to be "just friends" say so. Even though a guy who really wants more will hate hearing that ol' song, it is the truth for you.    You may also feel he's not even someone you want for a friend, in which case it's best to just say you don't think you have enough in common.    Try not to go into a list of the reason's why, even if he asks for it. Your wrods, "You're not good looking", "you're not interesting", "I don't think you're funny". Will ring in his mind for a long time.    Just "let him down easy".    If he is annoyingly persistent, then get an adult or friends to support you in giving him a clearer message. |`|QPZ5eXE8aa	Based on what I have seen happened to guys, the most effective way to show you are not interested in a guy is to tell him you have a boyfriend or show up with your boyfriend or a guy friend and that will show him that you are interested in someone and not him, plus he won't become all stakerish due to your boyfriend posing as a threat.    Hope I helped|`|InpaF48Maa	Just that. The guy will get over it sooner or later if he looks like he's hurt.

Not "sorry im' busy" that wouls be a slap in the face|`|GSsWYRBRaa	Maybe I'm crazy but telling that to a guy straight up is better in the end (in my opinion). If you let a guy down "soft" or "easy" that often gives him false hope and then he'll have more trouble moving on. As harsh as it may seem to just said "No, I'm not into you so move on", the guy should be more hurt because he doesn't have that false hope that you guys could still work in the future. That's just my opinion and I prefer girls to tell me honestly rather than add all that "fluff" to try and let me down "easy" because then I get the message and thoughts of "us" don't linger in my mind and drive me crazy...|`|7QZa9YlLaa	wow... did he already ask you???    just tell him this:  "i dont want to out with you"    guys are not that smart to understand what you say if you tell them something like "im really flattered that you like me and i like to you too but as a friend. i dont want to hurt u so i would like to stay friends. you wanna hang out on friday??"     thats retarded. they wont get it!! to guys u need to say it straight out. they'll get over it :) |`|AA11652934	It's never easy to reject someone, feelings will be hurt.

cZfCw2UAaa	Wow, this is a tough question.  I totally understand what you are saying.  I really admire your conviction to keeping your virginity.  Greatlyy admire.  You are to commended, and few have the discipline to get it done, which is why you don't know anybody who has.  I encourage you to stick to your guns and save your virginity till marriage.  I think, though that you may have already decided that you may want to experience the same things as your friends and explore this phase of a relationship with girls.  I think that's completely understandable.  I think you will know what is right, just follow your gut.  You'll be okay.  |`|N7UCCGDDaa	i think that you need to keep standing for what you believe in. i 19 and i also am abstinent and i know its hard but with God's help all sin can be overcome.you shouldn't lose your identity you know. just because you've developed new friends and are around people who don't always believe the same way you do, doesn't mean that you should lower your standards and resolve to engaging in the same things they do. i mean i have lots of friends who are having sex and drinking and cursing and a lot of them know its wrong but they do it anyways. but that doesn't discourage me from restraining from those things. i know that God blesses those who do right and in the end it will all be worth it. so please really resort back to what you believed before and really explore why you believed these things and why you made these decisions before not to do these things and im sure you'll find the answers you need. and if you have anymore questions about like what the bible says about sex or drinking etc. just e-mail me cause i know a lot about it. but please keep your virginity especially for those girls out there who are still waiting. |`|kdRY3Ulhaa	the crap that was put into your brain about sex and religion will take you years to get over....Its really a waste of a person's youth to deny themselves what nature put there....You are learning not everyone was messed up by this, thankfully ...and i hope you learn it fast.|`|8JUTi5L5aa	are you kidding! that amazing. Most guys will tell ppl they have had sex cuz they think its cool. seriously that is awsome and i think you should continue abstinance. you seem like a cool guy and if a girl leaves you cuz you are a virgin than they obviously werent looking for anything serious and only want to sleep with you. keep up the good work and good luck   God bless|`|7QZa9YlLaa	um.... i dont think the best first thing to say to a girl is "im a virgin" cus that means "im inexperianced"     if shes breaking up with u because you wont have sex with her, shes not the right girl for you. the right girl will wait for you. DONT give in to some slutty girl trying to seduce you. remember your values and follow your judgement. it is NOT a competition|`|PgS7aHNNaa	I think that you should wait untill your comfortable. Thats the only thing that matters... if you've given up on waiting till marriage. If you really care about someone.. and they truely care... they will respect your decision and honestly... I find it attractive that you've tried this long to save yourself.. cuz thats what most guys i have met want, and honestly... it makes everything worse.. sex should be about love .. and i reallly dont think that matters to anyone anymore... :[|`|lABpG32laa	If the girl can't respect your wishes and tries to pressure you to have sex before you're ready, then she's not worth your time. I think that what you're doing is really good. I'm a Christian and I want to wait until marriage before I have sex too. Just remember what the old saying is "sometimes the easiest thing to do isn't the right thing to do". Just because everybody around you is acting up, don't let that deter you from doing what you know is right. You'll be rewarded for it in the big scheme of things. |`|21064ae026bd0a704fce212f14bde60eaa	i think you should continue being abstinent, i applaud you for it. :)|`|5dPLL5Ayaa	You  hold on to your regeious beliefs , and noing that would be that if a man cannot contain  himself he should marry , for it is better to marry than to burn, GOD has purpose for you, he is faithful and will do just what he said dont let the enemy get you to doing those things that are contrary to the word of GOD as you no it, and yes fonocation is wrong because it is the mixing of sprits as well as being with another person companion. you continue to pray and stay in the word pray and do what is right in his sight because As GOD sit hight and looks low he is a seeing eye beholding all we do , he speaks to us in dream and visions and through the word of GOD, ,you continue on that straight and narrow street  for surly there is a reward and dont worry about your life he already has it outlined it for you and I pray that he shows you your companion  for life BLESS YOU AND GOOD LUCK.|`|VQ2HPYzFaa	are you joking?  thats like the coolest thing ever.  i say,  save sex for marriage.  talk to her calmly and explain everything the way you explained it to us.  if she doesnt agree,  shes not worth your time.  hope i helped.
vLchAW2Jaa	Instead of looking away...look right at her and smile. At first, she may look away because she is shy but she will notice you and your smile even if you don't think she is looking. The next time you two cross paths she should look you in the face and hopefully return the gesture. There's your sign! If you really like her, give it a try. If nothing else a smile will remove the tension you both have felt as no one can resist a true smile! One thing is for sure and that is...if neither one of you does at least this...the tension will only get worse and if a simple smile can remove that alone, it is well worth it. If she keeps up the tension after that smile of yours shines brightly, day after day. Keep on smiling and consider yourself lucky that you didn't get involved with her. Crazy as it sounds some people like to live in misery. I say, live & let live! |`|4VrLsTbzaa	i go with Leyla   I  I  I  I  I  I  I  v|`|OF22yYcTaa	talk to her, start a conversation, say hi... only way you'll ever find out!|`|h2WkfMzgaa	Yep she definitely likes you.

7kkzMG8Xaa	okay that is definitely just for the sex. but you can never be positive, so just use your best judgement! if he asks for anything it's probably jsut for the sex and if he wants just to spend time with you and be with you it's most likely because he really likes you. hope this helped :]|`|7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	You seem to have answered your own question.

If you are interested in being married, try speaking to a marriage counseled. Also seek legal help - even if she is not ready for divorce, can you initiate the proceedings under reasons such as her unwillingness to consummate the marriage etc.    You have options - use them, dont be trapped and dont do anything foolish that will give your wife's parents something to use against you in a court of law. |`|DS21ekeJaa	Can you take her to a doctor?

Or if you leave it could even be possible that she comes after you and tries to hurt you. You need to talk to professional councelor like a marriage councelor for instance. This might work i know if you call the cops and tell them of someone who is on sucide watch they will take that person and put them though emotional classes to help them with their attitudes. If i were you i would leave that relationship but only in organized way. Dont just leave her to suffer cause it sounds like shell go crazy and kill someone no joke.

Seriously the cops would be my best answer.  |`|dEc2HHDFaa	If she shouts at you, the threats are attention seeking and the chance of suicide will likely be very low.

She knows you are unhappy and is dominating/ruling/threatening you by making threats about taking her own life.      Emotional blackmail it is termed.    She wont hurt herself.  She is too clever for that.    If she has family nearby to assist her: leave and start a new life elsewhere.    Reflect later on what you learned about yourself and your wife in your marriage, in order to not make the same mistake again.

Go with what your heart tells you!!!!!  Hope all goes well!!!!!|`|Yu6A48mVaa	Move on. It sounds like her version of "taking a break" is just to be with another guy.

Its the same as her opening your mail checking your phone its total mistrust and an insult into your intelligence !   Good on you for seeking an answer to any problems by inviting an open discussion it often gains a new perspective and has more than likely helped you this should not been seen as a threat by your girlfriend ! |`|Uyt34pcQaa	Maybe you should have a long discussion with her and ask her why she's doing that.  If she is insecure, then she should try and find out why.  It's obvious that she doesn't trust you and in my opinion it's a really important matter. You can't be in a healthy relationship if you don't trust your partner.

p3rnyBoYaa	Don't have sex until you are ready. If he loves you he will wait.    As for the other stuff. Keep your Mom informed where you are. You are 16 and it sounds like she was very worried.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	As a 16 year old young woman, you can make your own decisions.  Although I would never consider doing something just to not make someone upset, that is selling yourself.  You will want to have sex with someone who loves and respects you, that person will be patient and understand.  So give it some thought, and do what you head tell's you.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	No. The answer is no because you asked this question. If you were ready for sex then you wouldn't be asking this question. Leave sex to the adult who can afford a kid. You are a child. Stay that way as long as possible.|`|AA11099449	Guys will try to have sex with you that doesn't mean you give it up so they don't get mad at you. You need to get yourself away from that type of situation. I doubt you want to get pregnant at 16. let him get mad and take his horny crap somewhere else.|`|8rLH4YNsaa	I honestly would say no. Ive been there done that when i felt unsure...and trust me...ive regretted it!    If you feel unsure, dont do it. You asked this question so your not ready.    Hope that helped x|`|G8VNBSj7aa	I don't know why people are nowadays soooo fooool.    What if you get pregnant? Do you want raise a kid without father while you are still very young and immature.

That same mistake was the worst decision I have ever made. Ask yourself this. Would you get angry at him if he didn't want to have sex with you?  |`|Ev3fFui4aa	No - you should only EVER have sex because YOU want to. Not to appease some older guy who should know better.    How dare he be mad at you!?  I suspect that's the reason Rachel took you over there, and I'm unsurprised her mum didn't knock on the door before coming to save you from what could have been a very dangerous situation for you!!      You are not invincible and as a near-adult, you now hold most of the responsibility to protect yourself from harm.  If he wants to have sex that readily with you, how many other girls has he slept with - do you want to be another notch on his bedpost, catch possible STIs, OR do you want intimacy with someone who you really mean something to?    Do you know in your heart of hearts that if Rachel's mom hadn't come along and you'd said no that he would have been OK with that? You don't know him at all, and even if you did that's no guarantee!!    I'm of the strong opinion that at 16 you should not be having sex with someone you a) just met and b) aren't in a committed relationship with.  Sex can be amazing with the right person, but this guy just wanted to use you, and I don't think you're old enough yet to be able to 'use' him back.    I really think you need to wait a little bit longer before you have sex, and definitely speak to your mum about it. It sounds like you have rushed in a bit with a guy you barely know, who's a lot older than you.  You're not even dating each other!  Don't feel obliged to have sex with the first boy that asks you, you are worth FAR FAR more than that. xx|`|uoEfoI7aaa	first of all, if your 16 and he is 21, regardless if you consent or not, he could go to jail.,   2nd, your way to young and he is taking advantage of you.  Do not have sex with him!|`|TOei73dbaa	No you shouldn't have had sex with him. keep you virginity for as long as you can. When you find the right guy is the right time to lose it, not with your friends boy friends brother who you probably just met that night. that's never a smart idea. Find a guy you really like and who likes you. Even if you don't want the relationship to go any farther at least you and him will be happy and you won't regret it the next morning
5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	If you were 100% about staying with your current boyfriend, you wouldn't be entertaining these thoughts...so, regardless of whether you start dating your best friend or not, it doesn't sound like your current boyfriend is going long-term. You both deserve to be with someone who is crazy for you, so it's time to have a serious conversation: not so that you can date this other guy, but for the sake of your relationship with your current boyfriend. If it isn't meant to be, then you should end it clean and amiably while you have a clear mind before it starts deteriorating.    Now, on to your best friend. If you do breakup with your boyfriend, don't run right into the romantic arms of your best friend. It would be terrible to turn what could be an incredible relationship into a rebound because you acted too quickly.     Stay single for a while, but leave your heart open to the possibility of a relationship with your best friend. Though granted, I don't know his side of the story, but from what you are saying, it sure sounds like he might have feelings for you...but don't force these feelings. Let them grow naturally as they may.|`|AA11099449	The guy probably is in love with you and hoping that you eventually see him more than just a friend. Give the guy a chance you wont regret it I'm sure.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	it is a path, not a dream, that is the reason I am not in it all the time, many were cought in that dream thinking that THIS is the end which is not. Attempts to hurt me just pushed me to this deepest level of my being that is so different from everything else, so intimate and the deepest. However, not permanent. But you cannot go in. Too late. Too many games you played and I have seen myself in so much pain caused by you deliberately that I could never forgive you. There is only one solution to this. And I will wait. |`|5DLxtZSDaa	Go with the friend. It might be weird at first but it will definitely be worth it.|`|BwGOjB1Raa	If you are even entertaining the thought of being with another guy then you aren't in love with your boyfriend and since you aren't in love with him you shouldn't be with him.  We figured one part out, break up with him.  Don't stay with him because you're scared to hurt his feelings because you'd be holding him and yourself back.    If thats just your bestfriend you shouldn't date him because you would risk messing up a good friendship.  You don't find friends like that often so don't mess that up.  There are guys all over the world, you just need to be single because you sound confused to me.

XIuntxnXaa	Well, if a boy likes a girl then he does alot of things. It depends on the guy.    Sometimes they get all quiet when your around and blush like crazy.  Other times they poke fun at you. They call you funcky names and poke you just to get your attetion and get you to talk to them, even if it sint nice half the time.  Other times theys flirt like crazy. More then they do with any other girl.  And sometimes they just randomly blurt out 'I LIKE YOU ALOT!'      And from what i understand this guy was flirty and talkitiv before. Maybe he found out you know he likes you and he dosent know how to act anymore, in fear he might mess up.    If you like him then go tell him back tell him.    Hope it helps!!|`|qSQZD6Obaa	I think teasing is a huge one, guys love to get reactions from girls that they like, that's the main sign I think of when a guy's interested =)  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...

I get really shy whenever im around the girl that i like. Its mainly because guys are sort of afraid that something bad might happen to the relation you currently have. Or that you might embarras him.       if you really like him, just tell him when you two are alone. If he does like you, he'll say the same. if not, he probably will just say that he doesn't like you, but he prolly won't tell anyone if you ask him not to.  (unless hes a total jerk.)      
urqGJPwpaa	Since you still like your ex, I'll be like most other people and say don't hang out with him.  The fact that this guy used to be friends with your ex, that doesn't matter.  It's another guy.  If your ex sees you hanging out with another guy, he will think you aren't interested in him, and any other feelings he had for you will be gone.  Just tell your "friend" that you don't feel comfortable hanging out with just him, and that you don't want **** to get awkward because he is interested.  Good luck.|`|l5MCXmTaaa	Yeah if you go with your ex's friend then thats it ... I dunno if he's like me pride and stubborn would keep me away from you. So maybe dont go with the friend... Also is it really worth waiting for this guy ?|`|YJjcqoUKaa	ok first off if you want to get back together with your ex DO NOT hang out with his ex friend bc he will get mad prolly.    and if this friend likes you   sense to guys the super bowl is a big deal to them i wouldn't say it is a date but it is right up there.    so try not to go what ever you do!|`|EPLfj2Zfaa	Ok if you hope to get back with your ex bf i would say you probably shouldn't be hanging out with his old friend.     Why don't you call up your ex bf and hang out with him instead?|`|N5LbkoiYaa	I think you answered you own question you don't "like" this guy so why would you go to this party with him? oh and any chance to get back with your x you will ruin, if he finds out you are hanging out with someone he doesn't like, knowing what he knows (the other guy likes you), even if its just an innocent party you are done for good. its a pride thing    this guy|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Zzzzzzzzz

Keep the child  or children from seeing daddy arrested though, because as it is, the child, children are confused right now, dont make it any worse then it is for the child or children.
Zss1QBUtaa	Lol I'm glad someone finally brought this up. To be honest with you, I'm 19 and a virgin (yeah, we still exist!) But I think that it's fun/cute when guys try really hard to 'get' me, ya know? So sometimes, yeah, I DO "abuse" that power. Wtf, I'm only gonna be young and hot once, might as well use it to my advantage! :)  I usually get free drinks at restaraunts/bars even though the guys know I'm underage :)  It's nice every now and then but sometimes, I do it to see how much I can get away with simply because I'm an attractive girl, and if a guy is like ridiculously submissive because he thinks by acting that way, he'll get laid- it's a huge turn off. HUGE.  guys constantly whine about how it's so unfair how girls can get whatever they want while the guy is left begging. seriously? then don't beg! move on! Don't be stupid and don't stay in a bad relationship because of the sex (or potential sex).  
8b606127c9be2be58aee79d6bf12e686aa	Yes, and it just seems like he will not go away for go. He'll call me up and tell me that he's dating someone and when I act like I could careless because I've moved on he gets upset and starts to stalk me. He will then call and text me for several days, asking me to dinner, movies, weekend trips and whatever he can think of just to see me. I think once a relationship breaks up if both people don't find someone new then the person that doesn't have anyone won't move on with his or her life especially if the break up was their fault. 
OYUtm87eaa	There's a lad that used to be my best friend.   We used to do EVERYTHING together.   Although I still see him occasionally, because we live round the same area, we fell out because I got a boyfriend.   I miss him like crazy and if I could sit down and have a proper conversation with him I would tell him that I miss him. |`|kvcIdORcaa	There was this close friend I had but we would fight or get mad at each other, so I would try to cut him off and end it. But he didn't want to... and kept trying to get me back. Really we loved each other but we both had a hard time saying what we really mean and I thought it couldn't work out.  So I kept running away but what I really deep down wanted to do was hold onto him and say how much I love him. I got two other boyfriends instead and tried to push him away. Well it's almost 4 years now and it's drifted even farther. If I could go back I would say I'm sorry I love you and I want to be with you

He spent it on rent, a big screen t.v. and lots and lots of coke.    Had they sold the house me and my spouse could have an a nice down payment on a house before my daughter was born.    But hell my dad gave me $50,000 to make up for molesting me when I was 8. When I was pregnant with my second and I paid off our cars and put down a nice size down payment on our house 20% or $20,000.

Im praying it works.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	I'm not sure I understand the situation completely - are you saying he's hung up on an ex and doesn't love you, and you are loving him, because he is the only one who has treated you like a human being in the past several years?  He's not the only one for you, BTW - any healthy person could be compatible with many others.  You are just cautious about giving others a chance, though not without good reason.     You've come a long way - too far to throw yourself away on someone who is unavailable.  You want to finish climbing out of the hole - keep getting help (counseling if you can) to try to rebuild your shattered self esteem and learn to recognize the warning signals of abusers, so you never get into an abusive relationship again.  Maybe you can also urge HIM to get some help.  Quit beating yourself up - others have done way too much of that for you, but that is what you are doing here.  Keep on moving forward, one step at a time.  Good luck.|`|cdsfJ5YFaa	Get over it????!!! Where's this guy at? He sounds like a good match, what you need, seeing your situation....why get over him.....be with him.
yZImAkozaa	long or mid-length, not above the shoulders. can't tell you why, though.|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Longer because I love running my fingers through her hair, and when it's long there's a lot more =P|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	long|`|iFOBRO79aa	It really depends on the girl some can rock the short hair but generally most girls look best with their hair at boob length.  I like hair that is a medium thickness.      Why?  Thats just my option.
G2ucfKHIaa	Nah! It is quite OK I went out with one of my best friend for a short period of time the only thing we did not have in common was she was ready to take the plunge and i wasn't, but on the other hand my second best friend she played her cards right, all the time I thought she was my little sister and when she saw the right time she told me how she felt about me for over ten years! I was very impressed with her in many way's and I mean that in a nice way and we have been married for sixteen years now.I believe good friendship = good relationships= some sort of future.By the way the other best friend we are the best-est of friend till now we speak about it quite openly with our spouses and we have a good laugh so go for it girl!|`|I3xpTwz5aa	there is nothing wrong with that its perfectly fine neway its good because u probably know him like the back of ur hand so u should tell him how u feel|`|cdd147902e81bc55214600dbc4c6afbfaa	Na, I think its ok. But like u said as long as ur best friend is single.|`|Al9ZUUNfaa	No, I had the biggest crush on my best friend, then dated him and fell in love with him. |`|9ADWgJhIaa	Its not wrong if their single hun. Just tell him how you feel. Who knows ... he might like you as well!|`|2vlyKhBSaa	nope, actually it is pretty normal.  :] i think if you date him it would work out if he is   your BEST FRIEND!  i have been in this situation. we went out for awhile.  then we just decided to be friends..  |`|2keIEMFUaa	I personally think that's wonderful, I think everyone should marry their B. F. of the opposite sex.  Why because you took the time to really know each others good, bad & uglies and you still love and forgive one another.  You've grown together.  I hope that makes since to you.
qDpFSqn4aa	Of course you should tell him.  Most guys think that most girls wouldn't have anything to with them and are too shy or embarrassed to even ask a girl out, I know I'm one of them.  Now that I've grown up and gotten a lot older I see the errors of my ways.  I used to think that almost every girl was too good for me because I didn't consider myself good looking at all but now I see I was wrong.  Evidently I'm a lot better looking than I thought.    Yes you should tell him how you feel.  At least it will peak his interest and he might start looking at you in a different way.  Give it a try, even if he turns you down (which I doubt) you will know where he stands and you can move on with your life.    Good luck.|`|I1wHgJAwaa	ye say it, u never know, he may like you too, good luck hun.
9fd8b1465b2efa955f7d5307f160bd7baa	focus on the prize.not the friends. you can show your interested without being moved by his friends. focus.

gO9tl2uhaa	so because 1 small guy likes you, you generalize this to every men? sexist much!      Just kidding. Guys like petite, guys like tall girls. Guys like girls. We heard the story.|`|jeHTjvbaaa	No idea, personally any women taller than me would make me feel pretty damn small lol. Glad I have never meet a girl taller than me =P|`|eLAkduCJaa	they like the idea of the relationship being a paradox. Or maybe he just likes you for you.|`|9LbTioS0aa	we do?  i didnt know that|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	i'm relatively short and i actually prefer shorter women.  call it a matter of ego but i feel awkward dating a taller woman than me.|`|ndjVs0ELaa	bcoz they short!|`|vVpd1mrxaa	Guys can be weird some times      http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|DlBeFoKcaa	we like the long legs =)|`|k5wqvI42aa	idk but it sux cause im 5'9 and i always end up liking shorter guys.|`|ikP2yMSkaa	Women are women.  We like all of them Short Tall Inbetween.  We just like women    You are approved|`|yfwSDroNaa	people always like what they dont have  in this case ur height lol  sorry if i come off as a jerk|`|fA9JQzszaa	I'm a short guy myself, and I like short women, but there some tall ladies that look good too. I dont know, I understand its awkward, but I guess he likes the ladies tall. I usually don't like to date tall women cuz its awkward to walk next to them. If you don't like him (personally, just cuz he;s short isn't enough to not like him, but it's ur desicion), then don't go out with him. I hope that helped!|`|COJq7M4Eaa	yes we like long legs, and we see it sexy if your tall, nothing else matters, what is important is that you love each other|`|EmWbvWEQaa	they don't trust me. they hate being shorter than woman. the thing is woman actually take it seriously and go "zomg! like hes like omg like shorter than meee! omg we must look sooooo weird togetherr!" seriously give it up it doesnt look silly its cute. and no i'm not a short guy or anything.|`|PV5f9PRIaa	guys just like pretty girls, no matter now tall or short, even though they do like long legs.|`|IqOaX437aa	A short guy would want to feel complete, thus, needing a tall woman.|`|AA11595860	For the same reason tall guys like short women. Opposites attract.  Dont count him out though, sometimes they are a lot nicer lol.|`|fOPgMmnTaa	I guess opposites attract

TUNvbXbgaa	i got divorced 2 times my first husband i married when i was 20 at 23 i got pregnant and that is when he became abusive i left him when our son turned 15 months old.  my 2nd marriage lasted 13 yrs. he started drinking a lot he he was abusive he punched me in the back of my neck and he would grab me by my throat and shove me against the wall.  he would call me nasty rotten names.  I am now married to a wonderful man who does not drink and he treats me so wonderfully.  i will never  divorce him.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Not necessarily. It depends on the person and on the situation. You can usually tell what type of person someone is by hanging out with them and getting to know them. To judge someone simply by the number of previous marriages is a fruitless exercise.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	people who find themselves divorced more than once may just be people who didn't make good choices. in the case of my second husband, i was his 4th wife, and i should have seen it, but love is blind. he put no effort in the marriage, and ran away with someone new at the first indication that there were problems. so yes sometimes there may be a pattern of behavior with some that would go hand and hand with not being able to keep a marriage or relationship.|`|pYtXrnDfaa	Sometimes there are circumstances beyond their control.  For instances, their spouse my become abusive after the marriage occurs.   You can put out all the effort in the world, but if you are abused, you need to get away from that person.   Also infidelity.  Again, you can't control if your spouse is not faithful to you.  You can't always say that just because someone is divorced that they don't put out effort.  Life just doesn't work that way.|`|eca5081cf1a52165be5f0e9110f9d187aa	Hard to say.  I know the type of people you are talking about and I too feel they don't really take "marriage" seriously.  It is just something "proper" to do when you are dating someone and sleeping with them for an extended period of time.  NOT!<br>  <br>  Personally, I think anyone who does it twice is certifiable, but that's just my own view.<br>  <br>  Lack of effort is a very good way to see it.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Divorce is not an indication of a character flaw. Sometimes people find themselves in an unhappy marriage with an abuser or cheating spouse or a gambling addict or other problem. There is nothing wrong with walking away from such a situation... even if it happens repeatedly. It fact it may even be an indicator of courage or good judgement.|`|8uxv6bGtaa	I don't mean to be sarcastic, but NO DUH! But, then again, some of my favorite people aren't very good at long-term relationships. Just be aware of who you are and whom you are dating. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you already have the answer to your own question!
0f4f51b3fee6f2bdf08b783e3a04a8d9aa	Hey, you're only 16!  Your whole life is ahead of you.  I get the impression that you feel life will only start once you've got someone special at your side.  It won't.  Yes, it's good to ask the Lord for that special person, but how often do you thank Him for NOT having someone yet?  Look at it this way... you're given a fabulous opportunity to get to know yourself well, to try different things and find out what you like, what you don't like, what gets you excited.  Determine your passions and pursue some of them.  Become the kind of person you want to be and you will naturally attract people with similar values and interests.  But it starts with you.  Also try to find out what kind of people you want to have as friends and what kind of person you'd like that special someone to be.  What do their values look like?  What interests do you share?  What do they like to talk about?  Find out what exactly you're looking for, otherwise you're wasting your time looking.  Seek and you shall find.  But you have to know what you're searching for.  And 'someone special' is just a too vague description.  Add details to the picture.    Good luck!|`|f9b446e38aaa5ac05bd9afab2682ed2eaa	hey don't worry so much. it's okay to feel lonely because you are a teenager. don't try so hard to fit in. if people want to be your friend they will no matter what. don't try to be anything you're not just so someone will like you. if they're going to be your friend they will for who you are and not for who you pertend to be. and the best friend you can ever have is God. he is always there for you even if no one else is. the bible says to pour your heart out to jehovah. by doing this you will feel a whole lot better and he will bless you efforts|`|654d8bbb97c9c8a855e4d8b2ede738ddaa	It IS really hard to find a good friend at that age. I know because when I was 16 my 2 best friends got pregnant at the same time and pretty much ditched me. Its not kindergarden where you can just say "hey, wanna be friends??" no, people are weird when you get older. Just try not to look and try so hard. eventually you will meet someone one and make each other laugh and it will just click. Don't give up, but don't obsess. It will happen just give it time. In the meantime, when you're feeling low and NEED someone to talk to, get on here, or on myspace. its a lot easier to talk to someone when you don't really have to TALK.|`|7981a82948b1c87c38fa4d0ea2a12348aa	yes, u should give up searchin, stop searchin. the person will come to u on their own. it is useless to spend your whole life searchin for some one. u say that u have been prayin the the man above right. then that means he hears your prays and eventually well seen u some one but it takes time, u know? then you're only 16, im 16, you have plenty of time to find that special someone, u know? so dont stress ya self, please dont. but hey, why dont u and i be friends, u know?. u can email me whenever u feel like it, okay. my email is lilttbpimpin@yahoo.com
7wDLzvl5aa	its how others subconsciously get over their own flaws, its really frequent, that and they always think that they wont be considered cool with the people they like to be around if they don't devalue others which is immature of course, but someday they'll get it and get over themselves.|`|pxKUyKIsaa	The world is getting better. This old black man told me that in 1980 while we were sitting in an after hours Jazz club. I did not believe him and laughed. Then he reminded that just 20 years prior he would not been allowed to enter the same club as me let alone sit at the same table. The squeaky wheel get the grease and bad news travels fast. but every where around the world there are people like you.   "Some men see things as they are and ask why. I see things that have never been and ask why not?"  Bobby Kennedy  Evil never surprises me but the fact that some people do the right thing for the right reason often gives me pause|`|OPzH4ih0aa	This situation here is a gray area. It's hard to say if I'm not there.|`|72gWADiMaa	Sometimes the best thing said is that which is not said.     Plus, what does it matter if your friends laugh at something? It doesn't have anything to do with you personally, and shouldn't effect you unless you let it affect you. There are times to speak up and times to speak out, but those times are reserved to very important things, not trivial schoolyard disagreements.    Live and let go. No regrets.|`|WxqeMSw7aa	Lighten up, you think too much...    You were putting up a pretty good argument with me just the other night, I doubt you would if you were to come face to face with me and that makes me sad.    Never be frightened to confront things you disagree with. If your "friends" can't handle correction, then do you really want them as friends ?      All the best M |`|AA12349214	Human nature eh?  You could have just quietly said 'Thats mean' and at least then your own conscience would have been clear.  But young people are notoriously bad for this - when I think back to how our group were it makes me shiver in shame!  So stick up for what you believe in without making a scene about it.
d2cbefbb54e74c2f40a462040ba8e0c5aa	There's a difference between naivety and impossibility.  I'd always say it is naive to assume that your first serious relationship will last forever but I know couples of all ages where for one partner their first love has been their only love and led to marriage, children and in a couple of cases grandchildren.  However I've never met any couple where for both people their first love has last forever.    |`|I6CIURO3aa	sorry to say but yea|`|D8SpQAgLaa	Yes and if your first relationship did last forever you might be insecure. You wouldn't know for sure if you could even be compatible with anyone else.  If you've dated a couple people before you're married, at least you know that if it doesn't work out, that there are plenty more fish in the sea.|`|zD2NWrIzaa	very rare to last|`|zg6sgA3faa	Yes, because everyone isn't in the frame of mind you are in. They might think it's casual and you will think it's something else.|`|DIxb4dVzaa	It depends on your age how much you have both experienced of life. It can happen, if you can work through your problems and never go to sleep without sorting your day to day problems out. And love each other and treat each other with respect. All the best|`|44AkhdRnaa	Very much so.|`|EBLUeixbaa	Makes me laugh all the kiddies saying together for ever they dnt know what love is!|`|r3G9ANyXaa	yes it is. when we have our first relationship, us girls will always think that he's the one, because we like them a lot. This rarely happens, BUT it can last forever. There is such thing as high school sweethearts who ends up getting married. As you get to know this person more and more, you will know if hes the one or not|`|w9HZ5jWUaa	But that's what you feel, right..? You can't help it. It's a natural desire, which is kind of a good sign but then oddly, in a lot of cases, things start going pear-shaped.    It would be nice if after a long time you could prove to yourself/each other that you were not so naive...    Longevity nowadays is history..?|`|JCPWhCWqaa	no it isnt,its about the person your going out with,if they are just in it for one thing then its not gonna last|`|qVYwyrPSaa	Yes, but is it not great to be naive and in love?|`|A3UftwH9aa	I find it quite naive to believe that an individual must be "coupled" in order to live a completely fulfilling life.|`|d3f352fe854d43d7b42addd84dbe08b8aa	Well funny you ask that because I just saw "Dan in Real Life" its a romantic comedy.  If you think about it, technically it is love.  Still a lot of people are looking for the golden love they here about that takes no effort and is always equal and a lot of other bs.  I personally think that what naive is to think that you both are mature enough to be able to change so much through the years and still end up wanting eachother that is hard and nearly impossible.  Still there are high school sweethearts so who knows.  Seriously though, you have no idea what your going to be like in the future and you will go crazy trying to figure it out.  Take it one step at a time and enjoy whatever you have while you have it and dont try to let it fly away.   |`|a9RqKLaGaa	yes|`|LuagEmwDaa	not just the first one, but every one|`|3gV4qBmbaa	i fink soo

There is a little thing called appeal that is required to be a player and lets face it, ugly guys just don't have appeal. |`|e1Ki8JK6aa	I have seen it done.  yes. it can be done.|`|bf6083ffadca74a66ca0bd4555eba2feaa	Two words:  Peter Stringfellow    QED|`|92a9415700fd70cfec8209a7ebda387eaa	Yes and probably more successfully then good looking guys as you don't expect them to be players!|`|C5X12FtAaa	ALyssach shut the fcuk up!    its small minded people like you who make this worls a siht place!    you think you all that? get a life.    Dude, be yourself and be funny and you will get all the attention you want from all types of girls.    Apart from the ones that are up their own butts and arent worth giving the time of day to.     grrrr, i hate shallow people!|`|96c966b8691bf8b7a40ea9fe0d761803aa	Yeah absolutely.     I always used to go for geeky, socially withdrawn, never had a girlfriend type guys because I was insecure, and so if I went out with them, they would love me more and be less likely to cheat. Only now am I realising that these types are just as bad as everyone else. I work opposite one of these geeky types who is married with 2 kids and he's forever leaning over my desk and perving down my shirt, which I have to deflect with my body language.|`|Q2Iq5RCYaa	What would looks have to do with being a player. Its an attitude/belief |`|OtdKzkMzaa	No  To be a player you have to have multiple girls, ugly people are lucky to have even one girl.|`|vLfS1tCVaa	yesh  quite a few r  depending on ur definition of 'UGLY"|`|AA11391329	yep, being a player doesn't have to be about looks.  It can also be about how well they can lie and smooth talk their way into conversations. |`|QE2JKDS7aa	yes.   there are so many in my school.  these boys are butt ugly and get tons of chicks.|`|ehTXMxX7aa	YES BECASUE THATS WHAT GUYS DO TO IMPRESS THERE "HOMIES"  AND FORTHERE EGO & PRIDE  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO BOOST UP THERE SELF ESTEEM   LIKE DUH|`|HMDnaZaeaa	Very easily.

My ex bf cheated on me & he was butt ugly!   but i loved him bcuz he was really sweet but still a player  lolz he had game!!    & this is true also  "even the players get played"  |`|cyTqnpgLaa	Yeah. Looks are irrelevant.|`|ZTGjLjMKaa	Yes, personality and swagger could help a great deal in situations like this. I use to see ugly guys  with different girls all of the time so it could happen. |`|Jm2SFYUkaa	ugly is an opinion so anyone can be a player, because everyone thinks and looks differently at people. For example: alot of people think jesse mcCartney is hot, i for one, think he is soo ugly, but he still can be a playre because of those other girls that think he's hot, make sense?|`|8668b9c394ca84cf59237d243f304200aa	yes they can.   Some men are players because they look good and know it.      Some are players because they think they look good.    Some are players because they are ugly but think they look good     And finally some are players because they are ugly and know it but play the field because they are trying to build up self esteem.|`|xG4JUn0Gaa	Men are born with the ability to attract women. No matter how good looking or ugly they are, they always can attract women. and yes ugly men can be players.

They should make you happy or they're just not worth it! If he's been with you for two years it either means he just doesn't love you or he really wants to mean it when he says it. Its also possible he could just not want to say it because its not machismo enough. lol    Anyway, I'd recommend confronting him and asking him to buckle down and advance the relationship. Take it to the next level so to speak. To me he just doesn't sound right! :-(     Just be sure to communicate your needs and what will make you happy!|`|70wT7Pccaa	maybe ur boyfriend thinks you are taking this relationship to serious and he does not like it. so i would take ur steps one at a time.|`|ZFjl0a2Xaa	First of all, you do not say how old you are.  It is often very different when we are young and fall in love with a man who is more worldly and has been "around" more than we have. (Here, I speak from both sorrow and experience).  He was far older than me and enjoyed the fact that he was seen with a much younger woman.  He also, refused to commit..which made me try even harder to be more beautiful, intelligent, with it and a divine sexual partner:"..Please don't give your power away...for that is what he is wanting...the more he "has" you the more he will continue to abuse you with games and mind games.  You deserve so much more....allow yourself to be loved by only those who deserve you and truly care for you.

3490bfd259ea171d15bc375ab4617cf0aa	Its over dude,  and she's a female jerk.    I like the advice above, pretending you dont want her BUT that isn't enough in this situation because you were 'together' 2 years and she now WANTS to spread herself to other guys.   She sounds like a typical opportunistic little shi.t.    What you need is another girl or girls/      I know the more she snubs you you want to "FIX THINGS" right?    Forget it, the worse part is after this feeling wears off and you no longer are chasing her, you are gonna kick yourself for acting like a puzzy panzie.    Happens all the time to guys.|`|fa0fbdb7417f1c0749c2644316f66350aa	let her go. the two pillars of a good relationship are honsety and communication. you 2 have neither. move on.|`|cfc364778b0186e522868964fe26c929aa	Too get her back, you are going to have to pretend that you don't want her.    I know it is hard to do. But right now you are making yourself to available. If she shes that you have moved on she will naturally want you back.    While at the party did you spend the whole time staring at her. At the party you should have acteed like she was invisible. If you danced with another woman she would have become jealous.     Move on,   Woman (sorry ladies) are like buses, you miss one and you can catch another.     There are too many ladies out there for you to be sweating this one.|`|e6bbd9e416e6e5be1f627d8a29bb77faaa	i think she is torn between you and the other guy so she needs time off you to see if she can forget about you and move on with the other guy.so she to go so you can move on with life.|`|42b73a774e93aeb0b46b5f085231c8c5aa	Let her go, and move on.  You can do better.  Looks like she has mixed feelings about you.  One minute she wants you, the other she dosen't.  It may be hard, but what's best is that you let her go.  Even so we give you advice, it's up to you with what you want to do.|`|8d93be7de642007bf17bebd39f3fdbc1aa	As much as it hurts, you need to let her go.  Like you said, you can't be sure that she will be faithful, and her actions last night were a clear indication of that.  You are the only one hanging onto this relationship.|`|bcceb325d75fac6129a65562f9ba93adaa	You need to let her go man|`|0e7ad426641bc073e41220853e2cd85eaa	Just ask her upfront, women don't like it when men beat around the bush. If she rejects you, find someone else, life goes on. Good luck and happy new year|`|bfd9dd8330d9544976d78b423cfd741aaa	Tell her to **** her friggin' boyfriend. Tell her to kiss his ***

Normally, i wouldn't blame you, but the fact that you don't care...  That makes you a total jackass.|`|xm7kFnfNaa	They say all is fair in love and war. Be careful though, the actions of the past usually find a way to come back and get us whether we did good or bad. So if you just want some quick gratification, I say its not worth risking a friend, an STD or pregnancy over.
1677427c47efe60ed5c8ab1dd807f842aa	yo estoy mucho mas feliz ahora casada que de soltera.....casate....de verdad te lo recomiendo ampliamente....|`|mZNesA53aa	Yo creo que lo mejor es vivir en pareja con alguien a quien ams y con quien construys tus propias reglas. Ahora bien, si lo que interesa son los bienes, hay muchas formas de heredarlos como por ejemplo, planificar los testamentos, organizar y determinar quines sern los que reciban los seguros de vida, las propiedades, etc. Casarse y divorciarse implica papeles, negocios, dinero y compromisos de ese tipo.   Si te va mal con tu pareja sencillamente le decs "hasta aqu llegamos" y cada quien hace su vida.|`|gdMOGfqiaa	mejor casarse y divorciarte,  porque asi te daras cuenta de la verdad|`|H3q2vYhaaa	menos mal que me recordas el a?o en que estamos !!!!

CIRSFtaIaa	It could be a number of reasons. From the look of thinks, I'm thinking he either thinks differently of you now or it's just the same and your over analyzing. Just act like nothing happen and proceed to talk to him. If he still acts weird around you ask him "what's up" - he could actually developed real feelings for you and gotten really shy. |`|AA11113523	im sorry girl.  it sounds like hes not interested anymore.  sounds like you two were talkign for a while, and now hes probably off trying to talk to another girl.  usually, once a guy finds out he doesnt want to talk to u anymore, he avoids you.  most guys dont want girls just as friends, but want a girlfriend.

OwwjKJLfaa	bonjour,  je pense que Goethe a voulu dire que lorsqu'on a pardonn  nos parents de ne pas tre les parents imaginaires qu'on rvait qu'ils taient lorsqu'on tait petit, lorsqu'on leur a pardonn d'tre des tres humains comme tout un chacun, lorsqu'on ralise qu'ils ont leurs faiblesses, comme leurs forces, c'est  dire, comme nous, et qu'on les accepte tels qu'ils sont, alors oui, nous sommes devenus adultes et je dirais mme plus, nous sommes prts  prendre leur place auprs de nos propres enfants qui nous imagineront les plus beaux, les plus forts avant de nous en vouloir de s'tre mentis  eux-mmes nous concernant et de nous accepter enfin comme nous aurons accept nos parents...  bref, acceptons l'humanit de nos parents pour tre adulte !!! tout un chemin !!|`|wPOqcD06aa	tout a fait d'accord.

On devient adulte qu'on le veuille ou non!  Le pardon dpend de la gravit des choses.  Enfin, ce n'est que mon avis.|`|6a92d72583fb4f0a601f0b02c1d7eedbaa	En tout cas, je pense que pour tre parent faut avoir compris les siens et avoir pardonn si tel peut tre le cas... c'est une belle phrase|`|975e660d84dbd8cb50e9dc933484173baa	Goethe devait avoir des problmes avec ses parents parce que je ne me vois pas pardonner les miens de m'avoir rendu heureux.|`|c7fc04ebcf21260ac6ab10abf28f213aaa	n'importe quoi!!!|`|uY9OpHeqaa	Je suis d'accord avec cette phrase....J'illustre mes propos...J'ai quitt ma mre  l'age de 16 ans tellement c'tait insupportable pour moi....Non maternelle, violente, goiste, alccolique, j'en passe et des meilleurs....Jusqu' l'age de 26 ans j'ai espr qu'elle m'accorde de l'attention de l'amour, je ne comprenais pas pourquoi elle avait t si dure....Je souffrais de son indiffrence (je lui en ai parl, mais rien n'a chang)....Et puis un jour, j'ai eu un dclic, je me suis dit qu'elle avait fait ce qu'elle avait pu avec ce qu'elle avait (quipement intellectuel et motionnel)...A partir de ce jour l, je ne lui en ai plus voulu....Je me suis sentie mieux....Libre et adulte !!!  ;-)    Donc oui, avoir pardonn ses parents, c'est tre un adulte libre.  ;-)  :-)|`|jc1G3VEuaa	Il a s?rement raison car le pardon aide toujours  gurir et par la mme  grandir.|`|kF1d90kpaa	jolie phrase mais je ne suis pas convaincue le fait de devenir adulte n'a rien a voir avc le pardon accord ou non a ses parents cela vient surtout de soi meme|`|k2T81leoaa	Pas mal.|`|VJdOVDX7aa	ouais la phrase est belle  mais pour moi "tre adulte c'est remercier ses parents"|`|v9nJazxkaa	mais pardonnerez quoi|`|kQDPbPoVaa	Je suis tout a fait d'accord.|`|Uf17y1SRaa	je ne suis pas d'accord.

KSzKQUUkaa	Creo que es querer tener una  compa?ia segura.  Y No sentirse en lo personal despreciado por una mujer y asi de alguna manera evitar el dolor que sin intencin de herir a nadie, puede causar  el que te digan "No" en lo sentimental.    Pienso que es algo que deberas entender de una forma neutral dandole la oportunidad de que l y tu puedan conversarlo de una manera amistosa y verdadera.  A lo mejor es cierto que puedas requerir mucho auto control y calma para poder llegar a enterder a este chico y tambien para hacerle expresar de tu parte, tu verdadero sentir con respecto a esta situacin y por sobre todo que sea Tu sentir, Tu parecer, no el que otra persona un tercero (a) que te lo diga y te haya causado un previo malestar en Ti.  Ese no es tu amigao (a) sencillamente averigualo por ti misma, cerciorate tu, y llega a tus conclusiones despues de que tu misma hayas tenido oportunidad de aclararlo con el chico.

oobdNWdBaa	ya|`|xccRugjHaa	Yep, it's a great show.|`|fOw6KzNuaa	Family Guy is testament to the decline of television quality. It completely lacks subtlety and half the jokes on the show could probably be replaced with "THIS IS A JOKE THAT IS FUNNY, PLEASE LAUGH NOW" and end up being wittier than the original. So no, I do not watch Family Guy.|`|SdQIQGcAaa	not by choice|`|xkWacKXDaa	yes, i do.  it's funny *** hell!|`|WBpVZpb0aa	Yes.|`|sLgI3cRpaa	yess  every night @ 11 on Cn|`|44zx5YC9aa	cahool whhhip|`|jEsRU2eqaa	yea! 24/7|`|Kx3ZmpsQaa	what a load of rubish|`|fIkriTAQaa	No, it's stupid.|`|qSj1s13Caa	yh|`|DZ787SKoaa	I love it!

I like guys with nice body but I dont want them so built that I feel like I cant cuddle up with them. Just the perspective of a recently single 34 year old.|`|ckZVn0KOaa	erm WOW. i think that guy number one is a little tooooooooo muscular.. blech. Although guy number 2 isn't too great either. I would say a happy medium between the two would be better =)|`|BZ0KVJkvaa	dayumm muscle man!!! uhm hello no offense to your buddy but you by far!    :)|`|f8f0487878bef325f88304a90d6e36b3aa	your body is good for a personal trainer but too muscular  some women will find it very attractive..but ur friend's pic ...i rlly didn't enjoy looking at.  somewhere in between would be nice.  looks don't rlly matter for most people  yopu can be the hottest person in the world but if your personality is not as attractive..then what is the point?
Sl0iE8cbaa	Compliment her on her looks, accomplishments or personality. Show genuine interest in her life and what she says. Physical attention, touching, hugging etc.... Spend time with her, that shows how much you are interested. Email,text or call on regular basis.|`|O0D9GtElaa	Girls might think that this is too old fashion, but I think it's really cute to open the door for a girl.  Or when you are walking with her put your arm around her.  Whenever she is sad give her a hug and just hold her.  Even though you think this all may be too sensitive and emotional, but we or at least I really love it!  Ohh yeah also tell us we look good that day, but don't do it that often becase then we think you want something from us by making us feel better.|`|dcZuFIKuaa	Kissing my neck!

CIUAIxXaaa	FIrst of all he needs to calm down. My brothers girl was dancing with some other boy at the WInterfest(Dancing I mean like her butt against his nuts)..I told him yall is not married yet, so yall is not commited. He is gonna be mad for al little bit, but he should get over it. The best thing to let him know is, that there is many MORE girl out there for him to date, that girl obviously doesn't like him as much or is "out there"..He honestly needs to find a new girl and leave her and I would do this for my best friend.|`|OID8OB1eaa	say dat thers other girls besides her, and that shes not faithful. she cant do him like dat. she not relationship worthy. ITS OVA!!!! ya digg???|`|lfMJPZ67aa	Take him out some where, that has a lot of girls tell him to forget about it and have some fun. If you are good friends then try talkin to him and listen, he just needs to vent his anger. Do something he likes doin' and let him know if he is blaming the other dude tell him he more than likely doesn't know she's with some-one. Good Luck you are a good friend to care so much.
dyV5gDx3aa	I am one of those guys, while not all guys believe in that, there are many that do. Its just finding them thats the hard part!    Dating someone for looks over personality is a selfish thing and doesnt represent a relationship that is meaningful and worthwhile. All those relationships END. ;]    Good Luck tho, you are bound to find someone that will like you for YOU and not for looks!|`|oZ2An1M0aa	yea there is some guys liek that. but not many. just keep trying and sooner or later you will find one that does. and becarefull on who you try to get. like the type of guys are matters in weather or not he likes a girl for whats on the inside and not the outside|`|W7DhZSy3aa	The best way to do this is to be friends with the guy first, this is hard when you are in school, im assuming you are. Boys these days just want to get laid, unless you are kinda like a dorky shy guy. those are the ones you want. i know it sounds crazy but if he wants to get in your pants right away, then he does not like you for you, you deserve that girly.... be aware and dont settle for less, they are out there, i got one of them.... dont give up it will happen, best bet  is when you meet a guy you like, tell him you want to be friends first, if he sticks around then hes your guy....|`|De6n2MaIaa	i wasn't aware we'd been charged for the ten points before.|`|AA10791200	as a guy,  i will tell you that the initial attraction are looks, you shouldn't have any problems w/boys approaching you, you have the option to be selective (LUCKY!!!) the rest is your personality and compatatability with the one you pick, be as selective as you can but be carefull.|`|jxseTHg7aa	sure physical appearances are not everything a lot of people care about personality|`|yudfOAQQaa	Try meeting and talking to guys at school or something-- you'll find someone soon! =)    Good luck!|`|gSdSRceRaa	Ash, it's like this........if a guy cant accept you for who you are...he's not worth it anyway ! Be proud of who you are, stop making excuses what you weigh or dont weigh and be yourself ! Be comfortable with who you are. If you do that, the right guy will take notice. That is a fact !! Your confidence in who you are will attract the right kind of guy.|`|5LEE91CGaa	again yes. but try birmingham, al.|`|SeNb5iFDaa	Just be yourself and love yourself...any guy that likes you for who you really are, is worth it :] DONT try to fit in or be someone ur not|`|zQ0mUDBUaa	simple be yourself!|`|sNvF6KPbaa	just as long as your butt and boobs are good then you will be fine.
AA11351979	I prefer choice B.

But I would also like A, never C ( I HATE jocks), and D, i would like him 2. Im kinda nerdy but never a jock, im quiet and love to read and i have only had 1 boy friend. i dunno my GPA. and im smart and nice and funny......|`|PjIJpqDNaa	A|`|F2JerT03aa	e. ugly morons who get bullied everyday. they are usually huuuuuuuuge!|`|WrbAfHQzaa	B: 15 yr. old dtgr.  Neither jock or nerd. more nerd but the best of everything all in one.  (B) sounds like he would be the most successful and have an easier life than the others.
e2a22fdeb8cf92a53082a8ba944d5d0aaa	talk to him about him|`|5e6f827c10807a358ec8c468a0da0047aa	just be normal . lol al this is normal i got backflip in my stomach when i first saw this one guy to but i annoyed it .and when u talk to him be normal again lol.  and if hes trying to be next to you all the time  that means he wants to go by you because he like u lol... |`|e28P8gWraa	Well the stomach spinning is simply because your hot for him, so hot that as soon as you are around him your heart practically explodes with the rush of your emotions. Thats awesome that he does that for you btw.    What to do is to accommodate him, since he obviously thinks your attractive as well. Just smile at him and look away, tease him, look for things hes wearing and comment, try tease comments tho, they work the best. Laugh at everything he sais thats remotely funny (dont worry you probably allready do cuz you like him). And make sure you touch him in some way every chance you get. Play hit him, tug his shirt, play kick him as soon as he gets near you, and anything else to touch him.     It will make him so comfortable around you and so hot for you that hell have to ask you out.|`|HfBLQ4sQaa	how old r u??    only u no the answer!!|`|U2CIP2LEaa	If you care if he is hurt u like him. If he trys to talk to u he likes u back! Bet he's a lucky guy!|`|rTRgzUxVaa	yeah it sounds like he likes you, and the stomach flip totally means you like him, and i don't know if this is true for everyone, but every time i get a stomach flip its because i like a guy and then he ends up liking me back, so maybe it's some kind of premonition.  but give it a while, let him know (subtly) that you're interested and you should have a date sometime soon!|`|NpdfsTXBaa	what???|`|qI8MWrWjaa	Try being his friend first and see where it goes.|`|JnMh2ua7aa	It's not worth the ten points, but thanks for the 2.|`|911851b2b251a8cb71cb5ba956d76d89aa	flirt with him and see how he responds.  The ideal thing would be to get him to ask you out but a lot of guys are wusses and afraid to do that so eventually you might have to.  The basic point is you need to go for it.|`|c4741f54417f5cd658d1c220ba7b1419aa	ahh, boys. well, he obviously likes you! next time he stands by you, just ask him a question. ANY question. If he plays soccer, ask, "did you have a game last night? how did it go?" and the conversation will start rolling. If your more shy, ask something school related, like, "Did you get  3 on the math homework?" or somthing. Once you start talking to him, you guys will feel more comfortable around eachother!!|`|oYdsU2ROaa	Just go and sit with him maybe then he will be brave enough to talk to you..or maybe you should try talking with him...Good luck  Ask him if his wrist is feeling better show him that you care about him ask about his day..|`|0mzI1BAYaa	Honestly he's prob just as nervous as you. Just be yourself and talk to him. It'll break the nervous tension, then when you're comfortable tell him u like him and ask does he feel the same.|`|SW9AjmqEaa	Lucky u!  Well of course, a backflip means that you like him! haha, and are nervous to see him, but excited as well, something like that.  Ya, I bet he likes you, by the way he looks at you.   Just ask "what's up", about his wrist, how are the sports he does, or whatever, something in his life. A question will start a conversation, and then you can try to be more casual. Laugh alot! Keep him in focus, to let him know you are interested, and keep a smile on both of your faces.   Best of luck!!!!|`|tKD6OqzBaa	you. like. him.    & just say "hey, how's your wrist?"|`|xuSHX9GLaa	i think he might. just be like so did you get the homework or do u understand what were learning in ___ class [[fill in with whichever class]]    im sure that will start a good convo.  good luck!!|`|4SZDuX1iaa	idk but answer this.it seems to apply to ur question    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|7ZEAPMmNaa	I think you both like each other! *squeals*  If I were you, I'd try to talk to him, or if you don't want to do that, have a friend talk to him or something.  Good luck honey! :)|`|2yzsXoyhaa	sounds like you like him   ask him about music or movies   good luck|`|JTsYDJPYaa	start a convo...like ask him about his accident...after tht ask him to continue it over lunch...or on a movie...if your female intuition is saying that he likes u back, ur probably right...so make the first move, he might like that|`|IVFU9Gxiaa	Just be yourself around him! You must really like him, just ask him what he's been up to and how he's doing!|`|71b2f5f33bdf6b91c85d30c447c8c9c3aa	talk about his broken wrist.. ask him what music he likes, ask if he needs help with anything cuz of his wrist..    go for it, you only live once. |`|FE9RMIO9aa	dumb *** how old are  you???????????????|`|izzDTVA6aa	just be yourself. ask him about his interests, hobbies, etc. just try to be friends first and take it from there  good luck! |`|2Fi3EmI8aa	This is an easy one - Start off by asking him about his wrist.    How did he do it, did it hurt, can you sign the cast (then write something cute)    Or you can be really bold, and just ask him to hang out with you on the weekend.  OR with you and your friends if you don't want to be alone with him.|`|HArDflVEaa	Well hes flirting with u which is a start now u've got him sturring but he needs to be boiling in ur hands if u know what i mean u should just be like in one of ur classes "wow i see u everywhere lol" then go from there and if he looks at u meet his eyes and smile i know that may be embarrising but just go for it! or  talk to his friends get some info go from there hope i helped!|`|k6XRVeJxaa	Only you can tell us what that means.    And say whatever feels right. :)    Good luck sweetie !|`|XazhbvC0aa	I think that he's interested.    But honestly don't worry too much about what you wanna say.  Just say it.    Guys can sense when you're worrying or stressing, and it's not very attractive for them.    Be his friend, act as if you're super close :)|`|RgXGSkE6aa	hmm well I think the fact that your stomach went funny when he broke his wrist means that you care for him. It sounds like he may be expressing an interest in you as well. Just talk to him about school or what you are doing in class. If it's possible try to work with him or be on his team in PE. Once you get to know him better it will be easier to talk to him and find things to talk about. You will also know his interests which will help.    Hope this helped, good luck! :)|`|p11Ml7PYaa	well I think you should go up to him and ask him so how's your wrist? you know try to break the ice with him and then let him know how you feel! it always worked for me! it seems to me that maybe he does like you why else would he stand next to you? I wish you the best! Good luck! |`|2Gs90coPaa	BE YOURSELF!!!!|`|YkJDR4fMaa	he probably likes you. go talk to him more often. hang out together after school and stuff|`|41773e69bcc2d0caab191e5945283b45aa	life is tough...    ...wear a helmet.    |`|f3bd999565e71da826c8343664e3b28caa	i think you should ask him out. the worst thing that can happen is him saying no, so go for it|`|ETb6Fyvmaa	It sounds like you like him.    You should try asking him who he likes, or even if he likes you.  Ask him if he is going to a local highschool football game maybe.     Ask him if he is okay etc.|`|HbwtOoqTaa	Give yourself to him|`|xNoBVEjpaa	Just talk to him more then you  normally do. find out his interests become friends and then slowly go into dating.|`|AbRabnVIaa	you definitly like himm! and it seems like he may feel the same. during class just try and takl about something casual like a movie or how lame the teacher is or something. he will probably be so glad you said something so don't worry about anything. just smile alot and be funny!|`|RJWyShaTaa	Just be yourself and he honest and see how things come out|`|Fu4yKd5aaa	well first you gotta find common ground with him something you both like well if your both in school especially theater talk to him about that don't just be like oh he he your are so dreamy and start slobbering find something your both interested in|`|gVfIRMhiaa	To be honest it does sound like he is interested in you. Continue to be cute not to flirty, drop little very little hints you are interested but let him pursue you. When your stomach does flips alone it is clear you like someone it is even CLEARER you like him whne your stomach does back flips!!! you have plenty classes with him to show him u like him and that he likes you! GOOD LUCK girly    oh and when you talk to him dont get all awkward let the convo flow naturally dont SEARCH for things to talk about  and all in all BE CONFIDENT that is the best advice i can give|`|G63iA3eCaa	jsut go up to him and start off with hey and talk to him about stuff like theater or if you don't like certain teachers or something just do it.  sometimes we men just come out and say that we like a woman without even knowing it.  and the whole stomach flippy thing is just a surprised type of reaction  its normal.  gl|`|ywx2q7GIaa	I think you did back flips because you were worried about him.If you just talk to him about the most recent stuff, then you will feel much better about him.Its not hard to talk to ppl, just act like he is one of your girl friends. just don't talk to him like 2 barbie dolls.|`|asNQUl4Qaa	all that means, is you care.  you may care as a friend or maybe more.   that part is hard to judge.  he definatly wants to get to know you  or atleast talk to you.  the best thing is to talk back.  and actually care what he says, he might want to hear what you have to say too. |`|8sLqZfplaa	Well...its the start of something! You guys definetly have some sort of chemistry between each other. If he likes you, then you dont want to change. Be yourself and dont try to be something your'e not. I had this problem too..lol a lot of girls do, just make sure to laugh a lot and talk about something that mabye happened that day that was funny or wierd or idk something interesting...start something and usually the boy will respond and it will begin something.  Good luck!|`|8essK36Kaa	When Your Stomach Did the back flip that means you are developing feelings for this boy and that you really like him back ... What i think you should do is write him a note letting you know how you feel about him ... i say a note so people wont be all in your business if you try to talk at school ... or if not a note just ask him out or a walk home... but first you wanna make sure he really like you because some boys can be idiots and act like they like you but really don't ...|`|8MiuhYtjaa	it means you like him. if your not sure if he likes you try to see if he does. you could invite him places and see if he comes or be really flirty. but dont become to clingy if you do go on a date with him. let him come to you. try to be extra flirty and maybe you can sign his cast or ask him about his injury. |`|sY7g3ttPaa	Frankly, the internet isn't the best place to ask a serious question and get a serious answer.  But I'm not like that. I deeply understand your tramua and have done research for you, and found a video on youtube that should answer all your problems.  follow the link below:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2b1D5w82...|`|67JXUn2zaa	i think that u like him  trust me there is this guy that i rlly like and he is sooo cute one day i saw that he had a wrap up his arm and i totaly flipped out cause i thought he had broke it but he rlly just scratched it rlly bad playing football while we were tlkin and walkin i had to be carefull not to get to close that i would hit it.  just be yourself around him and get to know each other  time will do the rest   if you r ment to be together then it may happen over timenow me and that guy tlk alot and r gettin closer as each day goes.  u just cant go to fast|`|TapJMSQNaa	You know how you talk to people on msn..  'hey, how are you, how was your day?'  just do that haha.|`|wdGi9IcKaa	Your stomach probably did back-flips because when you really like somebody and u havent seen them in a while and your unsure whether theyre okay or not you get exited/worried/uncertain and most importantly anxious. Ask him if he likes you, be straight up with him and that will lt him know that you mature enough to take the situation maturely. Find out if he likes you back and if so get to know him and hopefully a relationship will branch off from there. There are maaannnyyyy things to start a conversation such as: questions on school assignments,,,what he likes to do in his spare time... his religion... if hes going to any upcoming events in your community... or simply how hes doing.     i hope this answered the majority of your question!     And best of luck to your future decision! |`|fCZ2nrLBaa	Well if hes trying to stand next to you you sould introduce your self or if you dont want to be so blunt about it find a way to talk to him if he needs help you should ask if he needs a extra hand. Just talk to him at first get to know him (if you already dont). If you talk to him and start hanging out with him then he'll come to you if he likes you, this saves you from getting hurt and making a new friend. To talk to him, look for him if hes reading a book and ask "what are you reading and talk about that then it will move on from there to keep the conversation going, introduce your self and tell him what class your in (work area) and if he'd like to meet you for lunch to get to know each other more. or you'll think of something.
0jhzFOV8aa	Yes!<br>  Attraction does not ask about mutual values.  Viva la difference!  <br>  <br>  But marriage----first of all imagine your are legally and financially bound to someone who has radically different ideas on where to spend money, time and effort or even what is a good charity to donate to?  Even all the other persons credit cards and such are your responsibility to pay. It is horrible.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	My wife and I are opposites in so many ways. It's called a complementary relationship. You learn more about life with an 'opposite' than you do with someone who is 'the same'.|`|AA11946996	Can you agree to disagree?
6kUx7fwcaa	One cannot escape reciprocity unless a person is a complete solipsis.    When I was younger I considered Shakespeare's words, A borrower nor a lender be.  I was more a lender, until I became a giver.  Even in lending, I consider it a gift.  If I need it, I don't lend it, because I don't expect it back.  Once it leaves my hands, I feel I no longer have it and it is gone.  In that way I escape the trap of resentment when people do not pay their debts back.  Everything depends on the perspective you take, not just the circumstances of the event.  There is always more than one way to look at things.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	The above statement, represents to me the distillation of Schopenhauer's philosophy. Accordingly he had no friendsand was susp icious and misanthropic in general. He had no interest in making friends, and he had a very negative, pessimistic view of life. Therefore anybody including friiends, of whom he had none would be viewed  by him in a highly utilitarian way.|`|AA11447210	Depends on the person...some people are users, others will only turn to people they consider true friends in time of need, and they'd want you to do the same if you needed them.|`|hGfMMrAHaa	A friend is always in need is a friend indeed. This still holds good. A borrower cannot be the friend until you forget the money.

First girl you gotta have confidence, it is like that saying confidence is key.

I dont think you should hit the lets go out. Hope this helps!    Also there is NOTHING wrong with a girl asking a guy out!

571ddef69a00e199bd9e82a5582a53abaa	i agree with you - it's a terrible situation. Unfortunately, It's Sally's decision. Much as you (or I) would love to help and save her, if she really wants to be in this awful relationship, there's nothing you can do.    Abusive relationships are strange, in that the deeper a person gets, the more they feel they love their abusive partner...there are a lot of reasons for that, but ultimately, all you can do is be there as a friend, and offer a model of healthy behavior for her and her kids.|`|zhHoHRRmaa	You just let her know that you are there for her and support her. Don't push her she's gonna have to realize for herself. But keep telling her that she deserves better! Maybe do some research on it and tell her about things you found! Maybe he can go to anger management classes and he can get better if not def keep her beside you and let her know you will always be there!|`|65a24bf89c4cf754a44969a5f84e5769aa	Sally needs to find some self-esteem and stand up for herself and her kids and tell this guy what's up.....if she was my daughter I would have taken this dude out already.....no woman deserves to be hit.....a real man walks away.|`|7BGrP5Mvaa	You need to notify the police. Then talk to your friend. see what she want to do. The choice is her. Suggest counseling for her and the kids. |`|kej0H1AXaa	it's tough, but chances are she deserves it and her fault|`|YJqw5Vtxaa	i think you need to notify the police department, and then put a restrainging order against him. If she does not agree with that and wants to have him back in her life try as much as you can to convince her not to, but if she insists I think you should tell them you cant have this disorder in your house because you could end up pretty hurt, not only emotionally but PHYSICALLY!!! Im surprised he didnt hit YOU yet after you confronted him and on top threw him out of the house. If I were you, i would be very careful walking around the street, and same with your friend!!|`|IvMPh09baa	Well... as long as they are in your home, they follow your rules.  This is physical abuse, and alot of times it takes someone else to call the police or step in on these situations because the abuser and the person being abused are staying out of fear and/or too scared to get help.    As long as they are staying in your house, then you have all the right to say who can stay and who needs to go.  You are not meddling in their marriage, if anything you are doing this for the kids... it is absolutely not ok for them to stay or see anyong abusing their mother.      |`|5hxWSezPaa	It is your home.  Tell him he is not welcome.  If he does not leave call the cops and have him arrested for trespassing.  Your friend can also go to court and get an injunction keeping him away from her.|`|AA11099449	Problem is that it's up to her to make the decision to leave him and the abuse. You've put yourself in a protective role (like a mother) that will probably backfire on you as you don't  ultimately have the say if she will or wont see him. Your intentions are good and you do have the right to choose whom stays at your home. But ultimately it's up to her to make the decision. Maybe counseling for her would help her.|`|NqbBjS0raa	It's safe to say his leaving isn't the end of this matter. You have to convince Sally this is the long term solution. The problem is that it affects the kids and his physical abuse of her is something she is going to have to face for their well-being as well as her own. The husband should go to a counselor and start on the resolving his problem. Anything short of this won't help in keeping him at bay. His 10 year plus history has to follow a different track. Maybe she will have to seek one of those shelters if he doesn't behave himself.....|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	? Excerpts from:  WHY DOES HE DO THAT?  INSIDE THE MINDS of ANGRY and CONTROLLING MEN  BY: LUNDY BANCROFT    15 Signs That Point to a Potential Abuser    1. A push for quick involvement: comes on very strong, claiming, Ive never felt loved like this by anyone. An abuser pressures the woman for an exclusive commitment almost immediately.    2. Jealousy: excessively possessive, calls you constantly or visits unexpectedly, prevents you from going to work because you might meet someone, checks the mileage on your car.    3. Controlling: interrogates you intensely (especially if youre late), about whom you talked to, and where you were, keeps all the money, insists that you ask permission to go anywhere or do anything.    4. Unrealistic expectations: expects you to be the perfect woman and meet his every need.    5. Isolation: tries to cut you off from family and friends; accuses people who are your supporters of causing trouble; the abuser may take away your phone or car and try to prevent you from keeping a job.    6. Blames others for problems and mistakes; the boss, you  its always someone elses fault if anything goes wrong.    7. Makes everyone else responsible for his feelings: the abusers says, You make me angry, instead of I am angry or You hurt me by not listening or doing what I tell you to do, also, Why do you make me hit you?    8. Hypersensitivity: he is easily insulted, claims that his feelings are hurt when he is really just mad.    9. Cruelty to children and animals; kills or punishes animals brutally. May expect children to do things far beyond their ability. For example: may whip a 2 year old for wetting a diaper, or may tease a child till they cry. 65% of abusers who beat their partner will also abuse children.    10. Playful use of force during sex; he enjoys throwing you down or holding you against your will during sex; says he finds the idea of rape exciting.    11. Verbal abuse: constantly picking at you, or says cruel, hateful things, degrades, curses, calls you ugly things, then says youre too sensitive. May include sleep deprivation  waking you to curse at you, wont let you sleep until this is taken care of.    12. Rigid sex rules: expects you to serve, obey and remain at home.    13. Sudden mood swings  switches from sweetly loving to explosively violent in a matter of minutes.    14. Admits to hitting women in the past, but says they made him do it, or it wasnt his fault. Uses threats of violence. Ill break your neck! Ill kill you if then says Everybody talks that way, or I didnt really mean it. If he has come this far its time to get help to get out.

AA11229423	Either her friends picked up on you liking her and want to find out! (yes they do that ha!) or she asked them to find out for her which happens a lot which should be a good thing for you because the majority of the time she likes you and is hoping you feel the same way. I think she likes you and has a feeling you like her but wants to find out. Make sure you hint that you do like her and good things should happen! Good luck! |`|erXKJQ3Baa	Hehe cute!  I think she's clicked on that you're flirting and isn't sure, so she's sent some friends to find out.  Sounds like she likes you if she wants to know if you do.  Go get her number! =D|`|fa8cA0W2aa	Im guessing she has talked about you to her friends. so i think she likes you|`|2zZU8dq5aa	You should talk to her and ask is she likes you. You should tell her because then she could think about it. Like i asked this boy if she liked my friend and my friend loves him so she probably likes you. And like everyday abunch of guys come up and say who do you like do you like christian. and i am just like haha no. and he rote me a note and believe it or not but im only 10. 5th grade is a jungle, like every boy likes me and seriously every day some 1 says who do you like? do you know who? do you like christian? and the thing that stinks is that i hate is when ppl get stomach sick. and my crush got stomach sick rite in front of me and now i hate him. lol just thought i'd share that|`|PmX8USk7aa	it meanz that she tolkz about u infront of em n mentionz how u flirt  which also meenz she mite like u a lil    so keep thz whole thing up with the  flirting  and try 2 stay more focused on her thn the problmz her frndz r givin u    and until ur sure u dnt mind her knowing she likz u dnt tll her friendz anythn  cuz they will tel 100 percent..  but dnt tell her frndz tht u dnt like her either try 2 make it into a joke u no wat i mean|`|EhvWiRu5aa	That definetly means she likes you.  Tell them she's a good friend and you enjoy you're time together.  Ask her to the movies when you talk to her...   If she's getting her friends to ask questions, its a go.  Good luck! :)|`|zGeRjemdaa	haha ok so i am fifteen and i know what my friends and i do in this situation either she is too scared to talk to you herself about it so she is telling her friends to do the "dirty work" for her lol... or she is just thinking on wether she would like to be with you and her friends are immature and wanna know if you like her first so it makes it easier on the one you like... either way there is a pretty good chance she likes you back bud lol.... hope i helped. ^_^|`|LrfwCW7saa	He he life lesson to learn here. Girls that age that like a guy, will get there girlfriends to go and ask the guy if he likes her. So yeah she likes you and she is just to shy to say it to you. |`|d0f4d8c2714f8be6ed7b35d66dfcee9faa	Do NOT let your friends do all the work for you. YOU make a move and talk to her. Let her know your interested in her by actually TALKING to   her. Girls are not that scary I promise.     Good luck!|`|43vN0Ed9aa	they are asking you because she likes you a lot!!     answer mine?!|`|aQMTzSqoaa	Bit of both.   could be either.  When they ask you if you like her ask why they want to know.   |`|AFkBE7Unaa	she likes you.|`|Tpc9gH5yaa	that means  yes she likes you because i am a girl who has done that to a boy so yes she does like you thats cool can you plz help me.|`|SHEhwsUaaa	WOW i am 15 years old too, but i am a girl! LOL Well if you like her just tell her friends, most of the time friends are always the ones that help friends get a boy/girlfriend. I have been through the same thing many times, i have never had a boyfriend! Hope that helps you! |`|B0udtUkVaa	she likes u trust me im a girl i know ask her out|`|AA11099449	She wants to know for sure that's why she's sending her friends so go for it. Nothing ventured nothing gained.|`|H6rPxpHWaa	She told them to ask you because she likes you too. keep it cool.|`|zUSGseuWaa	i think its because shes bitched to her mates about you flirting so they've gone to see if you do like her.    just say to her by text or whatever that you do like her.
gJE0ujbzaa	You do have a problem. It sounds like you really like the guy...as a friend.    And he's really pushing and is going to have a meltdown when you give him the "I think you are great but as a friend" speech.    He's using all the "you're the best thing to happen to me" and "I screw everything up" crap to guilt you into staying with him.    I'd give him "the speech" about really liking him but wanting him as a friend. And then get out and about and start meeting other people.  Join a study group, join some school clubs, go out and do things you like to do and meet others who like the same things.|`|CKWABfYIaa	i have a boyfriend and even before i went with i am still scared of comittment and i just like flirting with boys but i dnt like being confined because i alwayz find a boy thats cuter and nicer then my boyfriend so maybe u should end it.Thats what im about to do with my current because im having the same problem.|`|pI1A0oc5aa	i think you need to be clear with him... if you don't i promise you one day you gonna end up resenting him and that feeling is gonna eat you alive... if you can't say it to his face, then text it, or write it as a letter, but you also gotta be nice... don't be too harsh, think if someone was to say that to you how would you want them to put it???
gdD36vidaa	i dont know wut u r getting at|`|v3vBcyGLaa	Since I'm older than you, my answer might not be what is right.  A facebook gift wouldn't really tell me that this guy liked me and didn't just want to have sex with me.  In fact, there wouldn't be any kind of gift that would make me feel that way.  Would I appreciate the any gift?  Of course... but that doesn't automatically mean I will change my thinking.<br>  <br>  The only way that would happen was if the guy SHOWED he actually liked me and was not trying to get into my pants.  And that takes time...
j6O8UiFjaa	i would want guy 2 tho the end stuff may need some help. but my bf dose all that 2 he's still a very good guy tho :-)|`|AA11263103	guy #1<br>  #2 is a druggy so no|`|hSsTlC6Saa	1, the drugs and drinking on #2=yuck & drama.
QWKk55oCaa	Dont approach them online unless you want to date them online. (Creepy.)   Just walk up and start up a conversation like.."hey, dont I know you from facebook?" or find out something that you have in common and find a way to bring it up and start a conversation. Try and come up at a time where you have a mutual friend. Try looking in your class at the people you know better..why do you want to date a stranger? You know nothing about these girls.  Approach them in real life, especially since you are older.     Also, you could try not dating for a while. Figure out what you are wanting to do in a relationship...get your head about you then go about it again if you still want to.|`|IulYR2Vwaa	i think you should try to actually talk to them in person before you send them a message on facebook saying they're cute. that's a little creepy and i don't think that's a good way to start a relationship.  ask them if you can eat lunch with them or something. or try to ask one of them to a basketball game at your school.
53b873dc19210bd9e4fae22faf08dc69aa	If you get in a relationship that you already know won't work out you will still feel alone.  I stayed in my marriage longer than I should because I had a fear of being alone.  But believe me when I say I felt alone in my marriage anyway because we were just too different.  Keep looking for somebody that is more compatible to you.|`|77cf62be6b744b736ae0c9195d1c1f31aa	Definitely to be alone, dude.  It's so important that you learn to be okay about being alone--that you learn to be okay with you as you are without having to have a girl there to help you find yourself.  If you're not feelin' it with somebody, it's dishonest to lead them along (and even lead yourself along) thinking that you have a future when you know you don't.  Whatever you're doing you need to be doing it 100% because you believe in it.  Whether you are alone or not.|`|oy1cUREzaa	End it, you can't grow while in your comfort zone, you can only learn whole being uncomfortable. only then can you grow as a person.|`|cZQttddbaa	Thank you. You are exactly like me, and this is exactly what I have been trying to ask in so many words for years now but I have not been able to word it as perfectly as this.    I just want to benefit from your answers if you don't mind. I will give you a star in return.      Stay Cool|`|OTlBdxYWaa	In my experience it is better to be alone then to be with someone you are not happy with. Once I spent some time alone, got to know myself and became ok with being alone is when I actually did end up finding the person of my dreams. When we are so desperate to not be alone we a lot of times end up in relationships that are not going anywhere with people that a lot of times do not treat us well. When we know ourselves and are ok being alone, we are more selective about the people we choose to be in relationships with, we are treated better and in return are much happier.
onRIYzZDaa	Aw! :] How cuuute! Well, confront him again. Maybe IM him casually & facebook/myspace him a few times too. Don't let him forget you. & when the holidays roll around, don't forget him & make sure he doesn't forget you.|`|m7rL9yVNaa	dont you get it? HE DOES NOT LIKE YOU. Dont make yourself become pathetic just to try to get him to change his feelings. |`|u62Azzjyaa	ok well the best thing to do is just to be yourself. i no it sounds lame but it is the best way you can possibly get him. try to talk to him more and make a conversation. if you say that you can hardly talk around him think of conversation starters before you approach him and then talk to him. if he doesnt try to make a conversation or looks away, then unfortunately he probably doesnt like you. good luck!|`|YNnhwYAnaa	Depending on your age... notes tend to be either funny, or show that you are too scared to talk to guys, and you need to be able to talk to him if you want to be with him|`|NFPFDdFvaa	Although there's no way to "make someone like you" you can deff try some different things...Dont be too straight up with him right now about how you feel, hang out with him.. BE YOURSELF no matter what because in the end the real you is gonna come out anyways... Just try to stay calm, breathe slowly... Get to know his friends to so you can find more out about him...  it will all come out in the wash if you know what i mean...  good luck!|`|GQa9i7rNaa	have you been reading too much of that twilight book?      um, talk to him , since i had to give you an answer.|`|vb1tDVQqaa	same problem here|`|rMmEKcO7aa	You';re getting in too deep, perhaps you should distance yourself until  you retrieve a little common sense. He may like you and may want  to be your friend and even be sexually intimate, but he may not be in  the set for a one only one relationship.  Get it?|`|iSFRkF6caa	Tell him  Answer mine pleasehttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  |`|Yg4PYds5aa	omg girl.  just be your self.  and have confidence.|`|AA12019016	"he could do the most horrible thing in the world and I would still like him A LOT!!"      so if you found out it was really him who was the mater mind behind the 9/11 attacks would you still like him A LOT!!???|`|bf6f925858e7132eae01026186cf27d9aa	Never make someone your priority, when you are only their option. You already asked the guy how he feels about you and he said nothing. Move on and act like he don't exist. Most of the time thats when they are all up in your face when you don't pay them any attention. |`|ILIY7Ocaaa	do what you do, players in a trance, its going down!!!|`|l32QFqjkaa	Just talk to him and tap on his shoulder when he is turned away to ask a question or talk to him|`|Fkm55Wa8aa	1st act normal around him so he can see the real you.|`|NeBDl4Hfaa	You're not gonna make the guy like you.  If you told him that you like him and he didn't make a move on you then hes not interested.|`|xuSHX9GLaa	same with me, except for i can talk straight. i actually liked this guy for 2 years tho.  but umm, i guess talk to him about it and see what he thinks, thats what im planning to do.|`|e3S1xaEcaa	I would suggest maybe playing a little harder to get.  Don't let him know--at least not so obviously--that he's got you.  You want him to have to chase you a little bit so it's more of a challenge for him.  If you give a little at a time, it will keep him wanting to come back for more.  Since you have already told him how you feel about him, just sit back and let him make the next move; the ball's in his court now.  You don't want to come off has an obsessed, love struck girl.  That tends to push guys in the other direction.  Good luck!|`|FmNwKXRbaa	Tell him   Write a notte [:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|sY7g3ttPaa	Do a barrel roll!|`|2Gs90coPaa	ahh the life long question.... the answer.... BE YOURSELF! no matter how hard it may be, a guy will only ever love you if you just be yourself. take my advice. good luck!

PXgDAGvoaa	umm well i think its good that you broke up with him.|`|ILZY7BD0aa	he is ..|`|Oz0h1TXwaa	omg he's such a punk.  you should break up with him  and never have a second thought  about it. that must be awful for you.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	YOU unlike (some other girls) were VERY smart to have left him. He was fooling around and toying with your emotions!! and you deserve better!!|`|IYgTS1eiaa	I think you should oh waited a while and talked to him. you dont know maybe him and is sister did have a great bond. most of my friends have great bonds with there older sisters. and maybe that girl in the background was his sister, cousin, friend. you dont know. i have more girl then boys that are my friends and im a boy. i talk alot to both of them and i have them both over. maybe you jumped to a conclusion to fast. call him or meet him and talk to him. just sit down and ask him who it was and explain what you thought. if it wasnt what you thought just ask if you can still be together. if its another girl he likes while beleave me its better to have a helthear break up and ger it off your chest then to just leave a message saying your breaking up.|`|a7xUvhqpaa	You're probably right to break up with him. There is obviously somethings he isn't telling you and trust is important in a relationship. You're too good for him. ;)|`|nGafpEwoaa	Sounds like a pretty confusing situation to me.  However, what I got out of it sounds like you should move on and find some one else you deserve more than him.  If there's no trust it's time to call it quits. He's not the only "fish' in the sea.  You don't need the back and forth stuff.|`|4UaHYaDcaa	He's not being mean, you're just taking it that way.|`|rmpvvQSCaa	wow, that was like in 1 sentence.|`|pnfC3f13aa	i think it's good ya'll broke up.|`|D7JZPxDzaa	Perhaps you were both at fault. If he apologizes, then so should you but don't accept all the blame.|`|SQjJxaOqaa	explain to him how you felt  and ask for the honest truth from him|`|htDt7l3Taa	Both of you are really. Bottom line though, if you cant trust him then dont try to stay with him. When you find the right one, trust will come naturally with your feelings for him. Im sure you dont play games with people so dont let them play with you. Just go on until you find the right guy. Its hard to do when your young. But if you want someone to always be there for you and only you, its the only way to go. Stick up for yourself. If nothing else this idiot will respect you for your integrity. Hope I helped.|`|6xFOQ5Ngaa	i think its good that you broke up, obviously you guys were having alot of problems, and if you were finding yourself doubting him and your relationship, im not sure if thats a good thing. And if his voicemail was about some other girl, i think he was doing more behind your back than you hoped, I dont know maybe this girl was just harassing him, but who knows. Maybe you should have confronted him in person instead of doing it over voicemail, but you should just do what you feel is right. Im only 15 so...i dont know if what im saying is helpful haha, but yeah just do what your heart tells you to. :)|`|lqAA51Kuaa	IDK-You should have talked to him about it. But he's a jerk for that.|`|3rBYqlCJaa	he's just being a man whore|`|4lASyV9yaa	in what i can see he is wrong for u i think ur better off w/o him u seem nice and he seems mean|`|ndhMSw8aaa	u r WAY too clingy just stop callinghim|`|yBCLHp9iaa	If you're not sure that he actually cheated on you then yes. If you are, then no. But you REALLY should check on your sources in the future, because usually us girls think we know exactly what we're talking about, but we don't.|`|7QZa9YlLaa	it kinda makes sense and it kinda doesnt at the end........    he sounds like a jackass but i think you should try to talk to him before you jump to conclusions :/|`|oDQHEgNSaa	spend more time on yourself and love will come, ppl gravitate towards competence, confidence and peace|`|C6SDwznCaa	honestly, your both being dumb. Mostly you and i know you dont really want to hear this but he is your EX boyfriend and if you keep talking and worrying about everything he does you will never get over him. moving on wont be easy but start taking babysteps.|`|rV9LPVOOaa	he is forget about the jerk you did the right thing he was obviously cheating on you.|`|7xLDnOQCaa	Breaking up with a jerk like that is the best thing for you!     There is an old saying, "if you hang out with dogs you get fleas"    Word of advice, be more careful in who you pick next time. "_"|`|vijlV3U5aa	I dunno but it kinda sounded like you and him had bad communication.    The dude did kind of sound like a deuce so, um, I think you did the right thing.    At least no one went emo. Oh, too late I dropped my razor. darn.     But seriously the guy sounded like he was evilly mean, kind of like the evil guy from Austin Powers and Goldmember who painted something of him gold. Yeah, you ex sounds that evil, you probably did the right thing by dumping him.

Dos ni?os pueden compartir un armario.  Solo tomarian un taxi x familia (entran 4 pasajeros)  En vacaciones: Pueden alquilar un monoambiente o una habitacin de hotel.  Te hes suficiente con un peque?o auto.  Todas las promos o paquetes son para "grupo familiar" padres y 2 hijos  Con poca diferencia de edad: comparten ropa, libros escolares, modas y costumbres...  Cada padre se puede encargar de cada hijo. Mientras uno cuida a uno que se enferma el otro esta con el sano.  Pensa que lo que compras es multiplo de 4: las hamburguesas vienen x 4, las pizzas traen 8 porciones, las empanadas vienen x docena, un litro se divide exacto en 4 vasos, como un kilo de helado. Igualmente las ofertas de estos productos se basan en el grupo familiar x 4.  Pero, siempre se puede hacer un esfuerzo si uno tiene ms hijos: apretandolos en una habitacin, reduciendo las porciones, pasandole la ropa del primer hijo, al segundo, luego al tercero y el pobre cuarto...pobrecito, no le llega nada lindo.

h3t4Uewvaa	stick with her  sex isnt about giving each other your virginity etc etc   i dont wanna sound like a sex ed teacher, but sex is to show your love & appreciation for each other & each others bodies. god how cheesy! but its so true   i can see where your coming from though, good luck with it (:       ps. tbh, shes 17, & shes slept with 4 guys yeah? well here in england that is practically being a nun! not making out that english girls are sluts, cos they're not, they just mature earlier :p|`|3vBALAlaaa	I think that you should end it with her, but I'm not sure you'll agree why...   1.She's a little old for you. By the end of the year, she'll be a leagual adult! You're only 15!   2.You have plenty of time to have a relationship! You shouldn't feel pressured to do adult things! If your uncomfortable in a relationship because you feel pressured to do something you don't want to do, end it. Simple as that!   3. If you just found out YESTERDAY that your gf wasn't a vergian, than she's been keeping a secret for a loooongg time. Do you want a woman that keeps huge secrets for a long time?     Please don't shun her though, you don't know the intentions behind her not being a virgin, and I don't know what she's like, so I'm leaving this up to you. I hope I helped!|`|xu0HiYEOaa	WOW, thats crazy guy.. It might be hard to find some virgins out there.. so you might just want to stick with her. But if she really is not a virgin she could be cheating on you some females can't go that long with on the pipe you know.. Get your man wet... get some pu$$y man..|`|sZePlWTQaa	If you plan having sex its nothing special, but if it just "happened" then it has more meaning. It happened because you both felt "something." Maybe then you wouldn;t feel like the "fifth"|`|AA12164862	I understand where you are coming from as I am a virgin and most of the guys I have dated have had numerous partners.  I don't  like it either and I just broke up with one guy who I really cared for but I just couldn't handle the fact that he had other women.  I don't judge him but I would like someone who hasn't been around very much myself.  Seeing that you are only 18 perhaps you might want to wait until it is the one and only girl and the one whom you wish to marry or be with the rest of your life.  Good luck to you...virgins seem to be few and far between and I commend you for waiting.|`|2keIEMFUaa	Personal girls these days most of them are not virgins anymore, which is very very sad.  Plus! girl manure faster than boys.  Really! This is some you must decide, but I personal think you should fine someone else because you can't deal with the fact she had sex with 4 different boys next time you should fine out first before you start dating someone, plus your both still young anyways and your right it is something Special between two.  That is why God made it something between a man and his wife.  Good luck to you whatever you decide.|`|ckMNg1n0aa	Tough situation.  I say no if you really feel like you love her a lot.  The past in history.|`|zhrakR9Aaa	I mean you cant judge her by her past because many people have done things they wished they never did. The fact that youre using her past experience saying you will only be giving up something, you dont know it maybe as special for her because I can tell you guys have a stable relationship. If shes been with you a year and hasnt wanted sex yet maybe that means shes a changed person. You need to tell her how you feel.|`|G5pv7jXJaa	If it really matters that much to you than you should just find someone else that shares the same views as you. However, if you really care about her enough then in time you should accept the fact that it happened and the past is the past but you cant keep avoiding it forever. If you think you wont be able to get over her past than that makes having a future difficult.      hope you make the right chioce for you (:|`|iu1DRoc1aa	well i don't think that you should start having sex with her at such a young age i'd say just wait til your a little older to start worrying about it.but....if you want my advice i don't think you should break up her.the thing is your 15 right now and she's 17.she's a little older so chances are she is going to be doing it at that age.so don't worry.|`|kYMHwxaAaa	seriously a year and half ! that's a lot and nothing should be tearing u apart or stopping you from showing your effection for each other. Does it honestly matter its in the past. think of it in a girl perspective guys have sex with many girls and when they meet that special girl that is a virgin just cause the boy is not a virgin that girl should ignore him? If u really love her u shouldnt care about her past.
AA11033750	I'm not, but I appreciate that you're trying to help your friend. Good luck. I'm sure there are forums or websites that can help meet other TGs.
28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	if he really loved you, he would not have cheated on you.    he wants to marry you because you have shown him that you will let him do anything he wants, and all he has to do is "show his love" for you to let it go.    He is not showing you he really loves you, he is showing you he can really control you.    don't let your love blind you on this one|`|t4n9LRX4aa	If you have any doubts please dont marry him!!! Youll only end up more hurt and lost in the long run... He may show you he loves you from time to time, but if he can cheat on you he doesnt love you the way you deserve to be loved... especially if its been more than once. If my fiance of 2 years ever cheated on me, I would leave him, in a heartbeat.. because I know I deserve more than that...     If you think you could regain trust, honestly, then maybe a second chance, but watch him and dont let him do it again...    If you cant trust him anymore, which is more likely, Id leave him... before he hurts you again, or gets some kind of disease and passes it on to you or something of the sort... you deserve better =)|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	dump him, hes cheated on you at lleast twice|`|AA11099449	If he can break your trust then he doesn't think about your relationship when another woman comes around.

If he cheated on you once, Twice...he gonna do it more. My advice is to leave him. Life is too short to be playing games or getting played! You deserve someone better you will only see you and not want anyone. Some one who thinks that you are the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. Trust me. I have been in your shoes before. And now I am engaged to a wonderful guy. ;)|`|nRtf72u8aa	If he's cheated on you numerous times then that means something is missing. He may not be sure about you both. I honeslty dont believe someone loves me trully if he cheats...it only means they dont know what they want & are afraid to be alone so they ballance both me & whom ever they cheat on me with. All it does is creates mistrust & mind wrecking moments for you wondering if he'll ever do it again & again. You'll become totally insecure not only driving him crazy of his where abouts but you'll drive YOU crazy. Can you honestly live like that being married to him? Im sure you love him hun but you gota love you & think of your heart. I think you should take a break from him & analize the situation & if you can see yourself married to this guy. Tell him you need time to think about things. Let him see that you're not playing games that marriage is serious & you wont be cheated on again. Show him you mean business & stand up for yourself. Good Luck|`|Q7Zu0x7laa	once a cheater... always a cheater, make sure that he wont do it ever again though|`|Vje7nSZHaa	dump him;  you should have done it earlier. |`|fPKkB75Jaa	ok, i tink you should i had the same prob wit my old gf, and i liked her alot but she kept on asking me if he could have another bf over and over again because i wanted to be nice so i think you have to let him go...|`|AA11161235	Cheating is not showing a person that you love them.

YOU SHOULD HAVE A TALK OR SOMETHING NOT GOOD AT THESE ANSWERS|`|9Gf900Moaa	 This is a fragile situation. some people say ,"DUMP HIM HE CHEATED"   But forgiving someone is very different.    You need to sit him down and talk to him about your fears before you jump into marrige. If you're still hurt over him cheating (which is VERY understandable) then you need to talk to him. If you do end up getting married, I would suggest marrige coucling. To deal with everything, you know?

I had that feeling few times, thankfully I have not got into the situation where I really cheated on my girlfriend. Maybe when that happens I realize that I have her always on my side, even though she is not perfect. I just hope I can be strong always.    Now, its basically all up to you. I haven't had to cross someone cheated on me yet, but I know how it feels. Of course if he did that few times and if you've talked about this with him, somewhere inside you still not sure whether he is going to do it again or not. But if you haven't talk about it, i guess its the time. Don't rush to get married yet if you still have that thought in you.    See, in relationship you cannot measure love, its all about believe i suppose. Counseling might be best, if both of you seriously want to make things right. If that still doesn't work, well its up to you. Obviously you do not want to get into marriage, have a kids and eventually he will cheat again. Good luck though...  
7cogf3U1aa	You are right that you shouldn't care. My granny told me, the only time you should worry about someone is if you have done something to make them not like you.     Let him hear you say to someone, "It's funny blah-blah hates me for no reason but doesn't have the balls to say the sh*t to my face. He needs to grow-up, get a life and leave me the f*ck alone."      Don't give anyone control over you like that. You are letting this asshole determine how you are functioning in school and damaging you mentally. Get a grip on yourself and send that bull right back to him. Whatever you feel about him voice it to someone to get it off your chest. You will feel much better.|`|glCRjZfKaa	probably. u didn't mention how old you are.  if i were you i would stay away from him. far far away.|`|6o7nvekPaa	If he doesn't have the cahones to say it to your face then you know he's not worth being offended by. If its really annoying you then confront him, talk to him REALLY calmly, with good facts to back up your claims, (sometimes blackmail is a plus if you know stuff about him) and explain to him that if he can't bring it to himself to talk to others about his problems then hes the retard. You can win an argument very easily if you remain calm, straight face, maybe some smiles and sarcasm if you can pull it off, and if he falters or acts weird you know you won, he will apologize after if he doesnt actually have emotional issues and all flirty flirty issues will arise.|`|WovFxDNKaa	It sounds like this guy likes you. I don't know how old you are but chances are if you're between 12 and 14 you're at an age where boys don't really know how to handle their feelings for girls. Sometimes they physically poke, pinch or just verbally insult girls to get their attention because they want to draw a reaction and sometimes get a little closer.    I think you should confront this guy, because whether he likes you or not, what he's doing is NOT cool. If you're not up to it, get one of your friends to tell him how you're feeling or to say to stop bad-talking you because it just makes him look like the idiot, and that if he likes you he should grow a pair and tell you!  |`|mUpiEAFraa	Look, you have a stalker, Ignore him the best you can.|`|jNFx4f4laa	I think you should just call him back rude stuff like he does.....and I don't think he actually likes you....|`|dkAu3pKNaa	it sounds like your kinda crushing on him, but that's ok .    anyway it seems like he wants attention and even though there's a chance he could like you it sounds more like he just needs someone to pick on.     ignore him and the things he says , a guy that ignorant doesn't deserve your attention and you shouldn't feel bad because i bet he has a lot of flaws.|`|XHQVi0MNaa	I think u should ask him what's his problem. Just what does he want from u a date or a punch at the face for being so rude. Get the courage to go up to him and show him that u are not afraid of him. That's just my opinion.  |`|5HAKsYaRaa	99 out of 100, this guy is a punk. the punks pick on the ones they think dont have to balls to fight back  if you aren't one yourself you should stand up for yourself and stare him down and challege him in some way  he'll either put his tail between his legs or you will fight it out which will be even better for your reputation and he will not mess with you again , even if you catch some punches its well worth it  the big deal is that you look like an *** in front of this punk, trust me please, dont take his **** unless he has some kind of a weapon, what is the worse that could happen, a scratch or a bruise "is a badge of honor that will lift you sky high!' punks pry on weak ones, he will continue unless you show him otherwise, then he will move on the his next weaklig|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	It could go both ways, but he probably just hates you.|`|7e6ZjOqiaa	That might be is way of getting a gf.

You have to get the attitude like you could care less if he's alive or dead don't let anyone knock your esteem down|`|009Fbd1caa	Only one way you are going to find out and make yourself look like the bigger person...confront him, alone, not with his friends because this will just give him an excuse to be immature. And ask him straight, if says he likes you..he obviously is actually shy about his feelings and would be embarrassed if you didn't feel the same way. and if he doesn't like you, just walk away!    -Good luck :)|`|44332dbfb6690b0d3565d73afcd5417faa	Why would you care if a guy who's rude likes you..he's a piece of crap, get over him!|`|HR4b54EYaa	He probably hates you for no reason. it's sad when that happens, but just go up to him and cuss him off, that should get him to leave you alone. :)|`|z1haY75gaa	"lowering my self esteem?"

In 9th grade these group of boys in my science class were incredibly rude and constantly making sexual remarks and, um.. "movements" toward me, and I was so disgusted. One time they even throw a tennis ball at my head from across the room and it hurt like a *****!! And then it turns out one of the guys had a major, major crush on me. Love is synomous with desire, and when one cannot have the object of their desire, it turns into resentment. Maybe try talking to them, and let them know that you truly have the upper hand... and try to avoid tennis balls!|`|bYAiqqwfaa	well i don't think he likes you because like you said that is way beyond crush hate and i really do think he hates you for no apparent reason |`|bCpHtVxXaa	he hates u for no reason. just go up to him and ask him what the heck his problem is. and tell him if he has something to say then say it to ur face, that should shut him up for a while. but i really don't think he likes u. cuz guys might be rude to a girl they like, but not like that. they would never call the girl they like a name unless they were joking around with that girl

Most women would also find that to be a bit long for their liking. However, if you have a lot of girth, how round it is, that is what satisfies women more because it stimulates more nerves of the vagina.    I hope you are talking about penis size and not shoe size or something.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	I guess you're bigger than average, but sorry to burst your bubble, it's not always good to be big because it doesn't feel so good when a penis is banging into your cervix.|`|Q06InngZaa	There aint no such thing as too big....|`|bBf7zc7qaa	yay im average|`|Gj0QU8lzaa	truthfully i think that is a good size but u might wanna make sure that u specify that you meant inches cuz me being a blonde it took me a sec to relize u meant inches|`|nRcSFAxlaa	some people lie on the internet.|`|uin3ffWDaa	mmm, that's just right.|`|0i4sNq2waa	Ah come on!|`|zaJaVnLmaa	6 feet.|`|ExBaodthaa	can i have your number?

She was disappointed u would not be on her precious honor roll and needed somehow to vent and someone to blame. Don't get me wrong; she WAS indeed out of line. Forget about it, she is your mother    Hope this u understand a little better,    Later    PS What makes you say she might have been high? That is of concern to me, could she have just lost it after having a bad day?|`|lfnjwpu1aa	A's and B's are great, your Mom must have been having a bad day, needs to see a doctor or has other issues going on.  This was no way to handle the situation.  By the same token don't you ever strike your Mother,  I don't care how angry or upset you are, she is still your Mother.  Please continue to bring in the great grades and be patient with your Mom I think she has some real problems and your grades are the least of them.

If she starts playing hard to get, ignore her until next time. To add variation - ignore her when she's rude or offend you on purpose (so easy to tell) or ignore her when you feel like it.    The fact that she plays hard to get suggest either of 3 things:  1) she likes you, but she's an *** to mess with you thinking this is the only way for you to respect her   2)she could be too shy to talk and insist on you making the first move in the most excruitating way possible  3) you're an *** to misinterpret that she's interested whilst she's repulsed by you    Ignorance is the perfect way to weed out the uncertain signals. Beware of denial and the shy retreat body language signal she sends out    The guide is not perfect since there's a whole package of stuff that comes along with this but it's a good start    Hope this helps|`|EJSdI25Naa	You seem to speak of her as if she is a fish. So, the obvious thing is that you are using the wrong bait. But it is a girl. First consider the unbelievable. She may not be interested in you. But, just in case she might be, let's consider the obvious. Does she know your name? Do you know hers? No? Well, you had best find out. How? Just ask her.  But speak clearly and understandably. Most people drawl unintelligibly.  Instead of hearing (in my case); "Hello, my name is Barrie," they cop:  "Ng-uigh, me nm e Brrngh."    Now, she would be in your class, right? Just go over and introduce yourself and then add: "Would you mind if I sat here?" Point to the seat next to her.     That's the easy part. Next enter into some light conversation but queries about her health and statements about the weather are banned. Perhaps you could pointedly ask how does she like  the subject of the class. You can also mention things such as school subjects that you like and why. After class you may offer to buy her a drink at the drink shop, coffee, coca cola  or milk shake. If she does not accept, you may have more work to do. But not on her. Next time try the technique on another girl in class.     You, too, can play hard to get.|`|XYBCQz8Naa	im going throu the same thing right now =(, wish i could help.|`|VQzmLWxoaa	id say dont get involved with those tyoes of grls    concieted types are no good, and most girls that do the hard to get game are conceited|`|HnrDCipfaa	yes i agree with the 2nd answer!!! ask her in a very flirty way 'why are you playing so hard to get' with a smile of course!|`|RnQFwIuUaa	Have you flirted with her? She isn't sure what the next step is and doesn't want to look stupid, so she doesn't take that step. You are going to have to help her take it. Be bold and ask her if she can help you write a paper, wants to have lunch, hang out Sat., etc. She may say no, but you will have tried. Good luck|`|vaEuZMvFaa	ask her y she is playing hard to get  if she actually answers you , then shes admittin to it and that she likes oyu too so if you ask her out then, she'd have no other choice  its not like shes gon keep playin the game if she gets caught playin the game|`|2ZVI4GGcaa	tell her stuff straight out   -hard to get girl|`|ppvfgdOpaa	Well, are you sure she is playing hard to get?  She could just genuinely not be interested in you.    Anyway, if she does like you, then just stop paying her attention, she will wonder why youre not playing along, and then she might get serious.|`|xdYcLnJPaa	just keep talking 2 her (or whatever ur doing) 4 awhilee. and if shes still like that then stop. n she'll relize what shes doing and ur tired of it and she'll come 2 talk 2 u.|`|BX76DJpEaa	thats easy play hard to get to and theres a little trick to pulling a girl u have to knock her confidence then build it up for example tell her shes not the best looking girl you seen but she has the most beatiful eyes you have ever looked into then shes gonna think that shes not all that and maybe u really like her for who she is it might sound horriable but it actually works|`|3ZV6uAbwaa	Pay attension to her..  Make jokes, make funny and fun convorsations.  Say things (not to often) that you should do something together sometime  make more jokes and convorsations.  Ask her out..      (first become good friends with her. not to close of a friend though)|`|AA12345296	i think girls who play hard to get are ussually fishing for you to make some big effort so they feel chased after or something like that. so you have to be persistant or make some big gesture or something. it's all an annoying game.|`|rbDbL2lPaa	I have a mindset when it comes to this and it does not matter whether she's playing hard to get or not... It goes "Let her do her thing, let me do my thing". She's playing hard to get so fine. It's their right to do so. Just ask her directly out on a date and set plans for it 3 days prior to that day. That is what you can do. Playing hard to get is what she can do. If things go well on your first date then call her up after 2 days and tell her that you had fun and would like to do it again sometime but do not set a date instantly so that you have one more excuse later on to call her again and set that second date. Just be cool about it. If she does not want to go out with you then she is just not interested. So move on to the next girl and be cool and be yourself in an attractive way, not in a wussy way. At least you tried asking her out and found out she is not interested.|`|E7JxB61Vaa	Follow her home and take out your gun.|`|wENPu76Eaa	Maybe she's not playing hard to get, it could be that she genuinely doesn't like you.|`|Zx5eI1qmaa	play hard to get with her but now and again do something that will attract her|`|NhX5577qaa	Act like you don't want to get with her anymore.|`|SsmHFXd9aa	if she is playing hard to get then she probably likes you. just keep letting her know ur into her|`|B7Eaz2xqaa	start to notice her more, and once she knows that you like her,,,,,ignore her...see that we girls don't like because we think you guys are not interested in us no more...So she'll start to notice you more, thinking that you don't like her|`|Rzmps2oWaa	well i am a girl myselft and i play hard to get all the time and the reason girls do this because they like to play it sexy, they want guys to want what they cant have..are you cetching on? well what you can do is also play hard to get if you want her to notice you just dont look at her and act like you dont like her and then later on find a way to talk to her:)|`|7QZa9YlLaa	i think the best way to get it to... be impulsive?? i think thats the right word.    when she walks away, grab her wrist and pull her back.  when shes hangs up on you, call her back.  if you see her at the lockers, walk up to her and do something to send her heart pounding.  when shes talking to her friends, run up to her and wrap your arm around her waist.     stuff like that i guess. i would fall for a guy who did that :)|`|gplXnlhAaa	1: Have you even asked her out yet ?  2: Did she reject you... ?  There may be a reason if she rejected you...Maybe she doesn't want to 0w0.   Otherwise show her how much she means to you . . Ring her text her talk to her .. Try to be with her and if she needs help with anything... Try to find her interests .. Just make you appeal to her. . See if it gets any deeper... If it does keep telling her how much you like her and wishes she was yours.. She'll soon see . . Unless she rejects your offers ECT that will explain A thing by its self x'D|`|BZ6EoNu2aa	I have 2 ansewers for you.Play hard to get back or Get a friend to ask if she would ever go out with you if she says yes then ask her out if she says no just deal with it.|`|Mzg40cA2aa	Be determined. Be focused on that one girl you want.  Make it clear that  you only want her and pull out all the stops for as long as it takes until she rejects you flat out. IF she does.  I play hard to get, and thats how guys win me over.  Well, assuming I like them too.  But yeah, determination is attractive.
AA10434027	yes its ok to cuddle with your guy friend and yes it sounds like you both want to be "closer".    go ahead and kiss him already.|`|KTygIq7saa	Yes, it's totally fine to just be a little flirty with a male friend.|`|fr5y4V1Saa	Ya more then Friends girl all those hands playing I don't call that Friend.|`|4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	Head on shoulder and playing with hands are clear signs of someone wanting to be more then friends, but unsure what to do about it. SOunds like he might have the same concern as you. I know it means potential embarresment, but you have to tell him how you feel and hope he feels the same. Otherwise one of you will get frustrated and then you might not be so close any more. Why don't you want to take the chance... are you happier single then you think you might be with him? The whole "don't want to screw things up" rationale is unhealthy... its far better to have loved and lost then to never have loved at all!!!!!
AA10172433	Eek.    Don't get into a fight with someone.    If it's too late for that, wear thick shoes and kick him.    Punching will hurt your knuckles.    I'm NOT advocating violence; I think the best thing to do is not fight at all.
TPESGhpfaa	FLIRT!!!! Rock ur stuff and bring it up graduly be like hey i just had a great idea there is this movie i want to go see u should come with! or something like that even if he doesnt nlike u he will be flattered!!|`|rzHRFEvjaa	flirt, flirt, FLIRT! u can figure it out from there :)
cd8ef1c894e7e25d56e3d24033dd2513aa	you can't consider that cheating, but you should be pissed off, he is your boyfriend, and i think that is enough for a porn site. try to be intimidated to him|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Dump that niqqa. He's not worth it, sweetie|`|AA11099449	Well if you put a profile on a site what would it be for? Answer is to meet someone as for porn allot of men look at that it doesn't mean that he is cheating by looking maybe he's getting ideas. But internet dating sites is a definite step in cheating.|`|tbJraueLaa	yes..|`|BQMDIIdcaa	hmm well you shouldnt be mad at him at watching porn cause most guys do that if they have a girlfriend or not, and the relationship site im not so sure of.|`|z1haY75gaa	guys are horny  guys masturbate  doesn't mean ANYthing about you  you can't suq & fuq us enough to get all the lust out of us, so you should be GLAD we do that instead of pestering YOU all the time    the dating site, that IS a problem|`|VMkh9JJRaa	1- sounds like you have a combination of:    real issues possibly (the dating site)    and    imagined ones- the porn.    2-     lets deal with the imagined one first-    if you have a problem with a guy looking at porn then i suggest you start dating women, even then you will have a problem so you might as well not put a "stopgap" solution to the problem and deal with your obvious self-esteem issues.    ifyou doubt yourself becasue he looks at slapper mags then that doesn't speak about him- it speaks about you and your own insecurity and bieng confident with yourself.    looking at porn is not cheating- if he is ADDICTED to porn, thats a problem, but still not cheating by even the most remote definition of cheating-    you might not like it, and you might ask him to stop, but odds are he will jus tlie to you and cover it up better- its human nature and masturbation is a healthy way to regulate different sexual desieres and keep him focused on you.        3- the internet dating site is a SERIOUS issue, and while he might have actually not been cheating by the normal definition- he could be looking to cheat or maybe has- either way its still a breach of relationship trust and should not be tolerated-    IF THE DATING PROFILE IS RECENT AND HIS COMMUNICATIONS ARE RECENT.    obviously, if the prfile is from 5 years ago and he is recieving emails but not responding- then just ask him to delete it.    you also in this LIMITED circumstances have the right to ask him to read the recent emails and his last responce to assuage your fears-    here if there is nothign going on- then there is no issue.    however, how did you find out about this?    if youhacked his computer you are just as guilty of breaking relationship trust as he is if he was cheating or looking to so you better make sure.    EDIT:   also i read your past question titles to get an idea of what else you are about-    seriously, if you are not going to have sex until you are married well- thats probably the cause of this too, but if he really is going on dating sites- thats wrong, he should break it off with you first.    in all honesty- despite what you have also might hear (condoms prevent pregnancy and stds- but i guess scared conservatives who only get abstinance only education tend to not realize that)    sex is an important part of intimacy- without sex, your "relationship" is merely a strong friendship.     this could be the reason and i strongly suggest if this is still the case with you that you sit down with him- discuss it and if that is still a factor- you will need to "re-evaluate" your choice here becasue it is quite frankly irresponsible.    if you cannot connect as lovers, then how do you expect to know you want to be with this guy?    that could be a huge motivating factor here so i suggest you discuss it and you need to realize you are severely limiting your options in life if that 'no sex" thing is still the case.    EDIT2:     don't mean to accuse you of low self esteem- but i don't have much to go on besides a few lines. and usually when someone says "i feel like i'm not sexy enough for him/her" thats a trigger for that.    quite frankly he could be looking- if the sex thing is a factor- then you probably have your reasons and have to make some decisons, wrong yes- but its reality that an otherwise good guy (i was bieng sarcastic about the girls dating part, but that would be hot), would be tripped up in that situation if he really has feelings for you-    but knows taht it won't go anywhere-    if not then odds are if he isn't the "cheating" type, then i would suggest having a long talk with him- don't dictate or blame to him-    fix things- you don't win points nor does he for bieng right, your relationship sufferes period and niehter of you win.    if that is the cause of his creating the profile- then you need to do some thinking-    if it was osmething else- you also need to identify what and if its something silly then get rid of him-    it could be he was looking becasue he wanted to break it off with you- (cowardly, yes, but still)    he could be a scumbag looking to cheat.      you won't know until you discuss it with him.    even after discussing it- if you still can't trust him or come to in the future, then you should break it off for both of you.    don't discuss blame, what happened happened just break it off and move on without the aggrivation of a heated argument that will just end in break up over these circumstances anyway.|`|I1wHgJAwaa	most likely|`|GUUa1s6Laa	Maybe the match making website,  not the porn though. Thats pretty natural for guys, as long as he doesnt watch it all the time.    But why is he on a dating website?|`|U6C4Bywwaa	Watching porn on the net or even on TV is totally normal and def not cheating. He is going to watch porn. Even if a man was witht he most beautiful sexy girl in the world, he would watch porn. It has nothing to do with you....  But if hes on a matching relationship site looking for females then yes you should be mad. Its not cheating, but its getting there ya know?|`|ca0db37cc242f17eb06d3e3e4612fb74aa	See how old the matching profile is, it's possible he might have had it up since way before and forgot about it.  If its current, then yeah, I'd have a talk with him.    As far as the pr0n goes, a lot of guys watch it whenever they can't get some.|`|o8LJqzZyaa	i don't think is cheating i actually i think is a very normal thing.  porn is usual for men please don't pay mind to that!  so just do your self a myspace and flirt your *** off!!|`|4ba7a6f2bd88f14c764637be238d1433aa	he may just be experimenting.  but I would deff talk to him about it.  if he feels like he is bored with the relationship, you might want to ask him why he would join a site like that.  porn is nothing. honestly, almost everyone watches porn at some point. my boyfriend watches porn, and i'm ok with that. guys do that stuff, its normal.    but if he denies the relationship site, then you might want to think about your relationship. |`|pbZywicUaa	If your boyfriend is putting a profile up on a matching relationship site, then what is it that he calls what he is in with you? certainly not a relationship! He has issues and sounds like he wants to have his cake and eat it to, mainly you. Sweetheart, the question is, why are you still with him? and why do you think so little of yourself? and think about this, would you ever put a profile up on a matching relationship site if you were in a relationship with someone? we both know the answer to this question. Again, why are you with someone that is not treating you as well as you are treating them? Trust me honey, if he's looking, and obviously he is, he will cheat, if he hasn't already. Do yourself a favor and kick this loser to the curb!!|`|lM3v3kxxaa	he's cheating on you, mentally|`|1e4CqeQSaa	no he is a pervert|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	He shouldn't have a profile up. I would just tell him how hurtful it makes you feel. I wouldn't worry about the porn, all men do that. Has nothing to do with you    Good luck|`|6abf7247a5dd56b3ba99929911e1314faa	Get over the porn issue.  Guys are visual creatures and will watch porn.  The site is another issue.  BUT, how did you find out about this?  Were you snooping through his things???? If so, thats odd.    Good luck!|`|QQctanGPaa	Well you should be concerned and remember that he is only a guy and if he doesn't think that you are sexy enough then he is not worthy.|`|3sV4mxqoaa	no you should not be worried...he is only watching porn, not cheating on you. oh... he might want to learn some new sex moves to do with you LOL dont know|`|8miMWB64aa	Probably.    I mean, not so much about the porn.  Don't get me wrong- I can definitely understand why you'd be upset- but most guys don't see the females in porn as real human beings to have feelings for, but, bluntly, just masturbatory aides.    The dating website, though?  That's an issue.|`|hP0u8u9Haa	no i don't think it is, as long as he's not meeting any other girls then your fine|`|55owncjLaa	No its not cheating, guys cant get enough, it shows hes horny, ands trying his best to wait for the right moment.    But needs to entertain himself with women.   However hes gone behind your back to do this.............|`|Jj4lwrLYaa	well to tell you the truth it is and is not guys do that just to get plesure let him know how you feel and maybe i know this sounds like werid watch it will him or spice up your sexy life and he would not need that nasty stuff!!!  Its not cheating physically unless its like web cam action other than that he just needs more action...  I'm sorry if this dose  not help.|`|6vr3Pfhjaa	Okay the profile I would consider cheating, or at the very least being dishonest. As for the porn, its hard to say. I mean all guys do it, as well as women, and its a perfectly natural thing to do. There is a lot of bad press on it lately, how people are addicted to it. But if he does it in moderation, I say just let him have his occasional fun. He's with you, and most guys wouldnt date a porn star anyway lol|`|ZmWxjQiEaa	It is NOT cheating. Many dating websites are used more for social networking and having fun rather than dating. Basically it is similar to him looking at other people. Everyone does it, and that is fine, providing he does not act upon it.     Likewise with the porn. That is just a male thing. You should not worry about it too much.    The best thing to do is have a rational discussion with him about all of this. Let him know how you feel without being accusatory and you will most likely be able to build up the trust again.|`|a807Wd19aa	I can understand how this would upset you, me too!  There is no way, I would except that @ $%!  You did right to express yourself.  However, your question is: Is this considered cheating.  I think not!  I say this because, he is only viewing nasty pictures.  Unless, he is actually communicating and engaging with the individuals he's been viewing.  It's nothing more then a man being a pig..Just kidding!  I meant to say, "being himself!" lol  I don't mean to make light of your situation.  My advise to you is clearly talk, tell him you do not appreciate it and how it makes you feel.  You may ask him why.  But chances are he'll say something stupid like, "it's just the internet it's not like I can touch them".  Which will just piss you off more.  In any event, don't let this ruin your relationship. (It may become a problem with any future relationships you may have.)  Try to rebuild the trust. Remind him why he is with you.  Light that fire, girl!  If you still do not trust him.  I'm sorry to say, it's really lost.  |`|bpjpD7W3aa	you could be sexy as can be, it's just men they are dogs. I wouldn't trust him,or any man. Don't you hate the dishonesty part?|`|QQ57J9VDaa	I think you should talk to him. Ask him why he feels he watches the porn and has the account on a matching website. Let him at least think you aren't mad, until he explains. Just tell him you want to know if there is something you need to do or if there is just some personal problem he is trying to figure out. It is only fair that you find out his side of the story. You can't just assume. Base your reaction off of his answers. If you feel that his answers are bull, then do what you feel is right. If you feel that breaking up with him is best for YOU, then break up with him. If you wish to wait and monitor his behavior then do so. Trust your heart, and follow your instincts.

Entonces muchas veces nos entristecemos y pensamos: ?en verdad existe y no andamos detrs de algo abstracto? o ?en caso de que exista podr ser correspondido? En fin, el amor lleg a mi vida cuando menos lo esperaba (ni siquiera pensaba en l como una posibilidad en esos momentos), lo revolvi todo y se march tambin cuando menos lo esperaba. En estos 21 das que ha durado mi angustia me he cuestionado muchas cosas y entre ellas la misma que t, y a pesar de todo lo que he sufrido no me parece que valga la pena vivir sin haber conocido lo que es el amor; porque cuando el amor toca a nuestra puerta y lo dejamos pasar (es necesario ser valientes y dejarlo entrar) lo transforma todo, cambia nuestro modo de ver el mundo, incluso las cosas con que nos hemos relacionado toda la vida parecen distintas desde el cristal del amor y nos volvemos ms sensibles, ms humanos, mejores personas. Es cierto que cuando el objeto de nuestro amor no nos corresponde o simplemente durante un tiempo dijo que nos amaba pero luego se comport de manera que hizo que dudramos de su sinceridad, nos sentimos destrozados y todo parece perder sentido, porque en esos momentos es como si nos hubisemos quedado sin un camino que seguir y diramos vueltas y vueltas en la nada y solo la mano de esa persona pudiera tomar la nuestra y mostrarnos nuevamente la luz. Pero en la vida todo es un riesgo y para disfrutar de una rosa debemos aprender a lidiar con sus espinas; y como dice Sabina  porque el amor cuando no muere mata, porque amores que matan nunca mueren.Si sientes que estas muriendo es porque en verdad sentiste amor y debes considerarte una persona privilegiada porque en la actualidad mucha gente vive corriendo y no se da tiempo para eso que debera ser el objetivo principal de nuestra vida.|`|e0ebb677f8d8f436d097153fa2ca31ccaa	...Vivir sin haber amado, es no haber vivido.    saluditos  BYE!!!|`|Moq600vAaa	VIVIR SIN AMOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|sjHZrAKPaa	vivir sin amor        http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|yt8uARS2aa	Bueno, va en gustos   Ejemplos:  Morir por amor (Romeo y Julieta).

46I87vD2aa	Aw, that is THE cutest thing. That's fine, and if you want more than that, don't be afraid to ask. Don't push a regular (lip to lip) kiss on her, if anything, asking is cuter than just doing it. I think you and this girl will last long. Good luck!|`|TtR9fpMhaa	If you the feeling from her that it is ok, then it probably is.  Try holding her hand first and see how she reacts.|`|WZXkri9Caa	O.K. it's really simple. You should take her to a movie theater that has an arcade and get her a stuffed animal. Or, you could take her to watch a scary movie and then she'll get close to you. But what ever you do, don't give her a kiss at school. Do it at the theaters. And also don't ask her for a second date until like a few days later. Does that answer your question? You could reach me at trejo3820@yahoo.com if you need anymore advice. Wish you good luck.

Either she is jealous because she likes him, or because she knows if you guys start going out that means she doesn't have you all to herself.  Don't take things second hand either.  I would ask him directly what he thought about the letter, and what he thinks about you.

Easier said than done.  LOL    I stick to VS and wash and dry in the machine and have had no problems.|`|BhesucZraa	Most bras have spandex or some kind of "stretch" material - the dryer will break the fibers and make it fit differently.  Don't put your bras in the dryer, or if you do, make sure you put it on delicate and don't leave them in there that long.  Also, when you wash, use cold water and put them in a mesh lingerie bag (they sell them at Target or WalMart for like $3).|`|QSPhxsq3aa	It's the way you're washing it. When you wash a bra and dry it in the dryer, it won't keep its shape. What you have to do is go out and buy a Bra Ball. It's made specifically to wash and dry bras in so they keep their shape.    http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_misc/102-7...

If it still gets bigger, maybe your breasts are too small.|`|ZCDdADZJaa	The woman at the lingerie store should have told you this, and you should have listened: never, EVER put a bra in a machine washer or drier (the heat of the drier is the worst). This twisting and wringing motion, combined with the heat, completely ruins the supporting fabric.     Buy a proper hand-washing detergent, even Woolite will do, and follow the instructions for WASHING by HAND. And always buy your bras from a real lingerie store or department, with a proper, professional fitting every time. Don't pick them out for yourself at Target or you will probably get the wrong size or shape for your body.
LDIM9Ky7aa	I believe your heart and head are in conflict.    Your heart wishes that the good times would go on forever with him.  Your head knows that the bad occurences showed you that he isnt the right one for you- and I think you know this deep down or you wouldnt be so distraught.    If I were you, I would not see him on Sunday. Its just going to let him think he can treat you a certain way and expect you to come back to him at his beck and call.    Plus, he might sweet talk you into something you know would not be the best thing for you. I also think you dont think you could say NO to him.    He might just want to get laid and thinks you are an easy target because you wanted him back after the breakup. (sorry to sound harsh, but...)    Move on, luv. Listen to your head, not your heart. Try being on your own for a while and just have fun with friends with no desire for romance.    It might clear your mind and soul.

UeCnigZ7aa	If he said he broke up with you because he felt like he couldn't make you happy, then you have to think about if YOU are ready to be in a relationship.  If you went on a date with someone else, it doesn't seem like you are ready to commit to your ex.      He seems to have some feelings for you so before you start expressing how you feel, think about if you really want to be in a relationship with him. You might get along great as friends but might not be so compatible dating.      If you decide to give the relationship another try, I think you should make the first move.  If you say you are giving mixed signals, you can't expect him to read you so unless he's psychic, he won't know how you feel. |`|plVXnjyVaa	Is that what you want to go back with your EX,    an EX tells me the relationship FAILED!!!      You shall be going back with the same man, it is within    your power to determine.  It can be more difficult when    a person is single to decide.  I suggest you take your    time to make this decision.

740c48006286f69e3d70811e6a1dc703aa	mira soy casado y tampoco le presto el auto a la esposa, pero si se lo presto a mi hermana y a mi padre, alguna vez mi esposa llego a tomarlo pidindole a su hermano que lo maneje cosa que me molesto bastante porque le estropearon un par de cosas que finalmente no repararon pero hay algo que creo que tu no consideras: entre los amigos tenemos una broma que dice ?como se le dice al hombre cuya esposa maneja? respuesta: peatn. Si yo le presto el auto a mi hermana o a mi padre tengo la certeza de que el auto volver y seguir siendo mo, pero si se lo presto a mi esposa puede ser que me lo quite, yo a ella le dije, es mi auto ?quieres uno? te lo compro pero el mo lo conduzco yo, ahora yo te pregunto ?el tiene la percepcin de que poco a poco lo vas a dejar sin auto? no te estoy preguntando si esa es TU intencin, te pregunto si notas que el tiene la percepcin de que eso va a pasar, quiza me digas ?y cmo saberlo? no soy adivina, bueno pues eres su esposa, ?como es tu actitud en otras cosas? y se honesta, muchas mujeres se las dan de justas y respetuosas y puro cuento, te salen con que lo mio es mio y lo tuyo es nuestro, mira quiza no te gusta lo que estoy diciendo y pienses muchas cosas de mi pero querias la opinion de un hombre casado y yo te doy la mia, yo ni loco le daria llave del auto a mi esposa, y si lo hiciera me despediria de el y me comprara otro, y eso no quiere decir que no la ame o que no le de su lugar y prefiera a mis familiares que a ella, es simplemente que no quiero verme despojado, mi mejor oferta sera esa, tu tu auto y yo el mio pero de compartirlo nada, y estas entendiendo mal las cosas, no te quiere menos que a ellos, una vez en una fiesta le preste las llaves de una camioneta a mi esposa para sacar un cd ?sabes que paso? decidieron que mejor acomodaban la camioneta en otro lado aprovechando que las habia dado las llaves y le dieron un golpe, a mi hermana le cobro, a mi padre le cobro ?sabes quien pago el golpe? ahora tu quieres acceso al auto y el no te lo da, ?que puedes hacer? quiza deberias ver como se encuentran otros aspectos de la vida matrimonial y tratar de darle confianza,  una mujer puede conseguir muchas cosas de su esposo pero tiene que ser muy ingeniosa, si vas al choque con el solo deterioraras tu relacin, haz lo que te dicen otros aqui, agredelo y a la larga saldran perdiendo ambos, saludos y suerte.|`|kFKh2izsaa	miramiga si el no te da ese derecho de lo del carro pues tu hazte de tus cosas y al igual se indiferente con el no se las prestes para que vea loque se siente no vale la pena discutir amiga ya que como te darascuenta no haz sacado provecho de la situacio y eso no s vale ok solo te recomeindo que cuando te ida algo tuyo pues niegale las coas y no le des derecho a nada para uqe vea lo que se siente tambiencuando te pida sexo tabien se indiferente co nel no le hagas caso mejor salte de tu cuarto y vete a dormir a otro cuarto paruqe entienda loque tu sientes con sus indiferencias amiga evita la discusiones con el ya que como veras no enteera y tendran probelmas que no los llevaran a nada bueno ok|`|bYThqm2Haa	Habla con el  muy seriamente sin enojarte como personas civilizadas, que porque a ti no te quiere prestar el carro y a su familia si, que se acuerde que ya tiene esposa y un hogar que ya no es el ni?o de papis que si no esta ya a gusto contigo pues que te lo diga y que cada quien empieze otra vida, ya que tu

cabeza y luego decide va?|`|fWD9xlKqaa	Si eso es por un carro, que pasara por una casa, cuenta de banco, es un hombre egosta y tu no estas en la prioridad de sus afectos.|`|IrIRmul8aa	Hay amiga, seguro no te guste lo que te voy a responder pero asi actuaria yo, es que mi caracter es un poco dificil: primero hablaria en buena manera con el de este tema haciendole sentir o saber que me molesta, especificamente no el carro, si no el lugar en que me pone a mi y en el lugar que esta su familia que por lo que se ve es mas alto, si no ves ninguna respuesta favorable, entonces comenzaria a apretar mas la cosa, me pondria brava, bravisima y cualquier cosa que pidiese lo mandaria a donde su familia a que se la busquen o hagan, que le lave, cocine, y se acueste con el su familia, no pasaria por ninguna dificultad ni me reprimiria por nada, y si me reclama por lkos gastos, adivina aquien le diria que fuese a pedirle que le ayude a pagar?????, eso si no te excedas, nada mas cubre tus necesidades, si con todo y eso sigue igual la cosa o empeora, quiere decir que no te ama tanto, o por lo menos el no sabe lo que tu representas para el, entonces me iria, o lo echaria a casa de su familia, para que al verse solo pueda entonces darse cuenta del error que cometio, pueda rectificarlo y entender que el ya tiene una nueva familia que debe ser su prioridad, y esa familia eres tu!!!................................cad... quien debe ocupar el lugar que se merece, no ocupes el lugar que te quieran dejar|`|KG6QDDEYaa	si estan casados por sociedad conyugal tu eres due?a de la mitad del carro.  y puedes ahcer uso de el.  si te lo niega es que tiene temor de que se lo quites.  si le da preferecnia a sus familiares, es que no confia en ti o lo hace por culpa y no sentirse rechazado por ellos  pero ahora tu eres su familia y debes exigirle respeto hablalo asi directo y dile lo que piensas.    eso hizo mi esposo pero con propiedades que compro y no me lo comunico y pusa esta propiedad a nombre de mi hijo de 25 a?os se confabularon y yo me entere despues. y estoy muy enojada ya que teng otra hija de 20 a?os y tampoco la tomo en cuenta.    esto sucede pero has valer tus derechos. si no sabes manejar toma un curso siempre es importante por tus hijos si es que los tienes y te movilizas mas.    aunque no esten casados por sociedad el tiene la obligacion  de compartir lo que tiene y tambien su familia es buena de abusiva  al no darte el lugar que mereces como esposa.|`|IF6P55puaa	hola mira no dices si se casaron por bienes mancomunados, pero como quiera tu tienes mas derecho que sus familiares a usar su coche  no te enojes pero pienso q te esta viendo la cara, exige le que te de tu lugar como su esposa que eres, si el trae carro di le q tu tambin quieres uno, te comprendo aveces uno misma por andar de comprensiva, abusan los esposos de uno, te digo por mi propia experiencia, a mi tambin me pasaba lo mismo, pero pues tuve que hablar con el, y nos pasaron muchas cosas, pero conmigo la cosa ya es mas pareja, habla con el,suerte!|`|a1aa8999c84db261aaf3513d504dfae8aa	es duro lo que te voy a responder,,,

atenderlo de la misma manera k tu.  NO TE DEJES, si de verdad te ama debe de compartir contigo y la unica k deberia de tener duplicado del carro eres tu y nadie mas|`|kFXFXQetaa	Pues eso si me parece bastante mal de parte de tu marido, pero la clave importante de todo esto es la comunicacion.Preguntale directamente el por que de esta situacion y que pueden hacer juntos para solucionarla.  Y opino que la confianza es parte muy importante de la relacion.|`|uuqxImIFaa	yo le preguntria que porke tiene inconveniete en prestarte las llaves... sacale la sopa, si no, siempre tendras la duda|`|caInREXnaa	El problema es la familia, tal vez por vivir en casa de ellos, el se siente en la obligacion de ofrecerles algo y al no tener confianza en que lo manejes tal vez es por que si algo pasa al carro no es el que se queda sin el carro  sino su familia, tu no sabes lo que han de haber dicho ellos a tu esposo, y bueno me imagino que debe ser solo el problema con el carro, si es asi ya sabes que es una autoridad q le impuso su familia que el tuvo que asumir solo por el hecho de vivir en casa de ellos. No te hagas mala vida uno a veces se tiene que hacer la vista gorda, trata de independizarte con tu esposo, aunque si el ya es tan dominado por su familia alli no hay nada que hacer por que aunque vivan en la china la familia le seguira pidiendo y el les seguira dando.|`|4idXnoJXaa	mandalo a la fregada!  no creo que sea solo con el carro  seguramente algo te esconde  pidele en serio una explicacin|`|lSrAnRcXaa	QUE TAL ESTE TIPO, PERO NI PORQUE TU FUERAS SU EMPLEADA DE SERVICIO, QUE TAL, PERO TE LA DEJASTE MONTAR Y FEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.,    MANDALO A VOLAR, ALEGAL Y DILE QUE YA NO TOLERAS MAS LO QUE EL HACE, QUE DEBE DE CAMBIAR SU ACTITUD HACIA TI.    Tu eres su esposa, por lo tanto tu te mereces ser la primera en todo, OTRA COSA, SI EL COMO EL CARRO LO COMPRO ANTES DE QUE SE CASARAN, PUEDE SER QUE SU HERMANA LE HAYA DADO PLATA PARA PAGARLO, Y POR ESE SE SIENTE DUE?A Y SE?ORA DE EL, HASTA DEPRONTO LO PAGARON ENTRE LOS DOS.    Y si fue asi, pues exigele, que tu quieres un carro para ti y para el, y no para su familia, POR LO TANTO QUE LA VIEJA ESA LE PAGUE LA PARTE DE ESE CARRO Y QUE SE QUEDE CON EL.    PIDELE UN CARRO PARA LOS DOS, DONDE SOLO TU Y EL LO MANEJEN, NO LA FAMILIA    BYE|`|wB6B5gTfaa	El problema no es el carro, es la actitud. Al parecer tu amas a tu esposo, la pregunta es si el te ama a ti. Si piensas que no, ahi esta el problema. Pero si piensas que si. Entonces no es problema, es simplemente que hay algunas personas que tienen esa forma de pensar, quizas el siempre quiso hacer algo por su familia y nunca tuvo la oportunidad hasta ahora. Si te hace a un lado a ti, es porque piensa quizas que su familia necesita mas de el que tu. Tu eres su esposa y tienes todo su amor, ellos solo lo comparten muy poco. Espero que asi sea. buena suerte.|`|2zAkyqebaa	Casarse implica un cambio en la vida de cada persona. Algunos no cambian. Al parecer tu esposo es de esos pues sigue siendo el hijo de su papi y el hermano. Vamos, no se ha dado cuenta que ya es harina de otro costal.  Tu tienes que evaluar que quieres para ti y respetarte y darte tu lugar que obviamente l no te da.|`|ZKu2EsMtaa	Saca un duplicado de la llave, y tomalo no se lo pidas, total tambin es tuyo., tienes mas derecho tu que su familia., tu eres la esposa., y como tal debe de darte tu lugar, y si el no te lo da, pues datelo tu.|`|4828a519bfeac3fad1df5778082a86e6aa	Sinceramente mandalo bien lejos.....recuerda que hay un dicho "El valiente vive hasta que el cobarde quiere"...y otro que dice "El hombre llega hasta donde la mujer lo deja" (que se aplica tambin a otras cosas por supuesto) ....Pero es claro que l ya te tomo la medida y por lo mismo ni se preocupa, sabe que llevas 4 a?os aguantandole y permitiendole eso, y solo tu sabes cuantas cosas mas...Es el tpico machn, dado que ya lo has hablado con l y nada pasa..."Mi mujer aguanta lo que yo le haga o le diga porque en sta casa mando yo"...Aunque suene duro decirlo, y tal vez sea conciente o inconciente de su parte, pero le importa mas su familia que tu.... Efectivamente, tu bien lo dijiste, el punto no es el carro, sino los derechos que le da a su familia...el tipo no sabe que al casarse la prioridad esta con la nueva familia, y la responsabilidad que conlleva el matrimonio...El matrimonio no es para vivir atemorizados ni peleando por cosas materiales...sino para compartir lo que se tiene o se logra, y vivir lo mejor posible, aunque suene muy terico, pero hay que tratar de llevar la relacin hacia ese estado.....si no es asi, aunque lo quieras muchisimo, mas vale que le digas bye bye antes de que te vaya peor...
5yATLJi3aa	It is like a sound system in a building. You notice things when they do not work properly.     A lady who smells nice is pleasant, but one who stinks draws attention  to herself.|`|SjEH1Lx6aa	I heard that almond and vanilla scents are actually more likely to turn a guy on.

A friend of mine as B cup breasts and when she goes out to the clubs she has a hot number that actualy shows from her neck to her belly button piercing.... dont ask about the tape tho lol|`|e2mqTBU7aa	Not too much, you dont want to look slutty.

Too much mascara makes them look skanky, if not like they have two black eyes.  I can't stand face makeup that looks like it was applied with a spatula, and heavy red lipstick that so thick it leaves marks everywhere.  And lipstick on the teeth, that's a good look, eh.     I've seen girls that look great with minimal makeup or without any makeup at all.       So no, as the saying goes, less is more.|`|EKM9AKc2aa	hell no|`|VQzmLWxoaa	helll no|`|R65Owmebaa	Its because they appear to be easy...Its that simple and you look Innocent.|`|foKDFigOaa	Sometimes it's the inside not the outside that counts.|`|cvd5S7pGaa	i absolutely makeup. i find myself most attracted to girls with beauty that doesnt need makeup to show through. i mean i dont mind a little lip gloss or something like that, but the heavy eye shadow or the black lines around their eyes is a real turn off.|`|q8MVZtmEaa	Maybe that's just what you see, maybe your jealousy is just unconsciously writing all this crap about some people.  Or you need to wear more make-up|`|15ha7h9faa	Hm are you jealous that these girls are getting more boy attention than you? That your exaggerating about them wearing 5 layers of foundation  If that was true I would hate to be their boyfriend and take them Out into the sun  Anyways you concentrate on yourself and leave those types of girls it's their prerogative  to do what they like to their face if they want lots of acne then let them|`|IKEvHsLSaa	Guys know that girls who wear a lot of make-up are slutty. Guys always think with their penis, so of course they will hang around slutty looking girls, because those girls will always make them feel wanted.    You on the other hand, probably do not hang all over guys and stroke their egos. That is bad if you are trying to get laid. But if you are not trying to have sex with these guys, then forget the make-up and ego-stroking. Guys will have more respect for you if you are a real person.    BTW, those girls will be the first ones in your class to get either A) Really fat... or B) Pregnant at a young age... or C) An STD... or D) All of the above.    Keep your sanity by keeping your real face intact.|`|piWfehB1aa	they like them because they dont know what underneath all of that make up! hahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|`|AA10731404	NOOOOO!|`|uPxoZjBPaa	i know i am not a guy but this is a girl's tip.

But i agree when You say That they look like cake...ew.|`|WJpJ6CVpaa	Maybe these girls have good personalities?  I used to wonder why boys went for this zitty ugly girl who wore TONS of makeup instead of...say me  I mean she takes the most ugly pictures on facebook and keeps the tags!  but then i got to know her and she was the most hilarious person ever and really nice and I realised she wasn't as ugly as i thought. she was actually really pretty once i got to know her  These girls are probably good people and its not really about looks|`|DgWUovrQaa	Nope.|`|DoqcfkyLaa	no. and you wonder why there still so many girls wearing thick makeup|`|9rCbdLbyaa	Well, if you like guys with bad taste that like women that dont konw how to put make up on, then..... you should start either looking to like other kinds of guys or to put horrible make up like the ones you describe.    Dont worry about it. Just look to learn different make up techniques for different ocassions, thatll draw good tasted guys to you for sure.   Besides, the word "make up", makes the best of what you have, but if you are pretty already, then not wearing it wont hurt much.|`|0f335c54c170fe2c01d7008662459bd3aa	Personally, I don't. A little bit of makeup is good, but when it is caked on so much that it is instantly noticable the effect isn't too flattering. Some girls can pull it off, many can't.     As for why most guys might go for this...most guys are sort of like electricity, going for the path of least resistance. Especially in high school. Wearing makeup is like presenting yourself similar to how animals might when looking for a mate (peacock anyone?). The harder a girl is trying to get guys to notice her, the greater the chances are for a guy to hook up with her.  A lot of people know this, and it gets used in a lot of comedic punchlines (such as on the Simpsons when Homer built a make-up gun, which featured a makeup heavy 'whore' setting).     There are always exceptions of course: some girls who wear a lot of makeup aren't trying to impress anyone, some guys couldn't care less what a girl wears on her face, etc. But for the most part, I'd bet my money on 'the animal kingdom'.|`|JojbdjNQaa	Well if the girl looks like a clown then HELL NO!!!!|`|tV8OIpIJaa	No, not too much or they look like hookers. Please answer mine?http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|QxFJLOj3aa	honestly all i like unless its a dance is lip glose. i like a girl who is comfortble with herself.|`|5xstzHIUaa	I think its personal preference.  Personally I prefer almost completely natural.  Be yourself, not your makeup.|`|aHhPk6teaa	dont change yourself for anyone. be you. thats all you can be. im a guy and make up doesn't make or break my relationships. hope that helped. i dont know why any guy would want that.|`|01wwuX2Haa	girl if you dont wear make up and you look like you, then girl your are like the beautifulest girl. = ]. and nope i dont like girls that wear make up. for me whats attractive is that the girl is real, and that she is herself (same thing as real) and whats attractive for me is their heart. i am a freshman! and this is the way i am. i know some other boys in school are immature and dont know what to look in a girl = ]|`|u2ZZ3mQhaa	I agree 100%, I believe natural beauty is very special. I don't pity those who try to cover up their blemishes either because it isn't their fault they have been given acne. I personally am very attracted to woman that wear little to no make-up.|`|xvJu5reqaa	hell no! i love it when my girlfriend comes over to my house with her hair pulled up, wearing her sweats, with NO MAKE UP!  it  makes me feel like she doesnt care what i think.|`|6MufeCwsaa	Most guys in high school are still maturing and un-sure of themselves regardless of how they may present themselves. That being said the "painted" look is very prevalent in advertising and popular culture today and that is where most of the younger men in our society get their ques from. If you plan on going to college you will find a change in the type of girls that men there find attractive.|`|njwEjGb4aa	all the girls that wear that much makeup think of themsevles as unattractive and covers up thier uglynes with makeup, u r a person who know they look good and dosent need to improve urself! also i dont like 2 much makeup only lipgloss and eyeshadow|`|LykjWv6faa	Get over yourself.|`|AAZTO16baa	a little bit is ok but too much looks like crap
AQpt6m0Xaa	Guys find it really sexy when girls take the lead. So first you should lead him into the kiss. You should put your tongue in his mouth before he does it to you and you should stroke his face. Make sure that you stroke him a lot. Guys like it when you stroke the back of our heads. Make sure everything you do is done slowly and smoothly. Guys like find it much more sensual when you do things slow. And also be relaxed and have fun with it ;)|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	in the bedroom, i like her hands down in my pants if you know what i mean.  out of the bedroom, just around my neck or waist
iwvRBeXOaa	First of all, do not just date him out of pity or to "try it out" as if you'll just grow feelings for him. That would be leading him on and hurt him worse in the end.    Secondly, if you only see him as a friend you just have to unfortunately be honest and tell him so if he tries to address how he feels. Know that you two can never truly be "friends" until he's over the idea of you as a girlfriend. By that I mean you can't really be friends for a while.|`|BgyN7oocaa	it's pretty normal for a guy to develop feelings for someone they've known for a long time. the emotional connection is already there, you obviously pass his good looks filter as well, so you could ask him. guys like the straight talk. or, you could figure it out from this fun site...    http://willshelike.me    and put his/your name in
01yBLHvWaa	If i were her and knew you were married id say no. Shes probably just being extra friendly because shes vulnerable right now. Besides your married... cheating is messy business. & Just because someone is attractive doesnt mean you should go against your vows.|`|EGt1a4Byaa	woah man watch it shes probably being really friendly because shes just that friendly person i mean your MARRIED come on dont be a guy that cheated and you might end up in a big fuss
Ux7v8rPQaa	i dont think its bad.  if you are with him because you like spending time with him, talking to him and because you are comfortable around him, then there is no problem there.  but if your with him just for the sake of having a boyfriend, then that wouldn't be quite right.  congrats on the 6 months!  im 18 and ive never been in a relationship that lasted that long.  =)  that has to mean something about the sort of connection the two of you have, its probably pretty good one :)|`|1iXvphNYaa	Has he met your parents? I'm only saying so should anything unexpected happen then no one is left out of the loop and you ruin the natural order of things in your house. Good luck. Chin up. Smiles.|`|Yo2XdHPRaa	no nat at all i think it is good because dateing is healthy|`|iNQK27Qqaa	Hell no, go for it perfectly fine. just as long he is a similiar or same age|`|a9TBcczUaa	no but just remember great sex is safe sex so make sure you use a latex because you dont want to send him that late text...not that i think im late  text..owwwwwww|`|hLUxMcKqaa	I think 15 year olds are better of doing things in groups most of the time.  You might think you wanna do something at 15 that you will regret having done at 25.  You won't think the same way you do now in another 10 years (or less).  I don't think there's anything wrong with having a boyfriend as long as you stay in safe situations and have adults around to support the safety of those situations.|`|vGihrOfqaa	no, i thirteen (fourteen in may) in the same position!! my bf is 13 to.|`|e7bM6WCKaa	Well your already dating him, so its not like your waiting until your 15. The only advice I can give is to stay strong if you start to feel pressured let him go. Your young and have the rest of HS and college to look forward to.|`|rAZppw7Zaa	I'm still together with my boyfriend from when I was fifteen (and I'm eighteen), but not everyone of that age is as compatible. Few of our peers who were going out have stayed together and their relationships now seem to me to have been sort of futile beyond sexual interest.    The way you describe your boyfriend as "mature" is also unnerving. How much older than you is he? No offence to you, but you should probably ask yourself what he sees in a girl who is much younger than him; surely he would find more intellectual companionship in somebody of his own age group? Do you have a lot in common, does he interest you, do the conversations ebb and flow? If you answered no to any of those things then he could potentially have malicious intent, and being in that relationship could put you in danger.    That said, I don't know enough about your relationship to determine. As you mature (not to be condescending, I'm not implying you're immature. Somebody of sixteen just has different agendas and interests to somebody of nineteen or twenty...) you develop and begin to learn more things about life. I recommend you leave big age gaps until you're older. But that's just me. :)|`|r4ar6YKhaa	There are ten year olds having sex at a school near me, so it probably is fine.|`|euVa3B2daa	No, it is certainly not bad because people in my school that are only like 11 have a bf or a gf.|`|67tQqGnoaa	no its fine don't go for someone more then 3 yrs older then u trust me I've been their!|`|gkl03Xchaa	i don't think having a boyfriend at 15 is so bad. im gonna geuss that you're in high school. n if you are, as long as you can handle a relationship and school then there shouldn't be a problem.|`|4v3vtthUaa	well,your not too young but you need to make wise decisions in your life and who you pick,but don't let him force things on you that you don't feel comfortable doing. :)|`|tIoM91Niaa	Ofcourse having a boyfriend at 15 is alright.  If you both love eachother and you two are responsible  do not ever let him force you to do anything.  you are in charge   everything takes time,  so do things at your pace ;)   hope it helps |`|vfVbMMbLaa	Its definitely not bad. I know some girls that started to date before sixth grade. As long as you dont get to the point where you might do something that you might regret. And if he's mature and you guys have been together that long then girl you got lucky. lolz|`|BbUiof66aa	I am 14 too turning 15 in May. Yea it is okay. And I am glad that he would not to anything to you. It is hard to find someone those days. And I think you and him should do stuff you both like and try some new things too. I hope you will have great times together.|`|ohpfpJnMaa	How bout some real advice=)    It all depends on how mature you really are. Im a yr older than u and i even look back now and think bout how stupid i was if hes a decant guy stay wit him but if hes alot older tell him how u feel but u need a break b/c even thiugh hes a good guy an all hes still a guy. trust me i know how dis works im a guy so ii know how hes feeling espically as he gets older.  Hope dis helped=)|`|CBuM050Naa	Why would it be bad? If you like somebody then..why not?|`|TGNf348oaa	no its not bad :D most ppl have bfs in like 5th grade...|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	theres nothing wrong with it.|`|A2ODlbKfaa	no ive seen younger|`|7nGwou8uaa	i think its fine, but you shouldnt go over board with everything and get knocked up, 15 is too young to even think about having sex. and dont think that because youre 15 that you are mature, because i thought i was at that age and i have matured A LOT since then.|`|quM6eMT6aa	no its ok just as long as your confortable with the guy|`|LsBS5bOCaa	Yes, having a boyfriend at 15 is not good. But, since you guy's are already together and you asked for advice:  1. DO NOT loose track of your studies in school.  2. always be yourself and exercise common sense.  3. use a condom, use a condom, use a condom!  4. do not isolate yourself from other friends.  5. do not be afraid to say 'NO.' see  2.  6. and if he wants to break up with you, let him go.|`|aIEkNM0Paa	no|`|Is3pmbbKaa	im 12 and i have a boyfriend! haha.|`|K2umerZ0aa	nopeee i had 1 at like 12 or 13!  good luck!!!! ;-)  !|`|wSq80V1xaa	Definitely not!|`|HI0oQriqaa	no|`|oMB5FnIMaa	No, my boyfriend and I started dating when I was 14. He is a year and a half older than I am. I am now 16. We've been together for a year and 7 months! So, no. I do not think it is bad. As long as he is mature enough for you and isn't too much older than you, other wise you would be jail bait waiting to happen.|`|rZuSN2kTaa	No.  I had my first boyfriend in kinder garden.  I'm 13 now.   I've had 8 boyfriends.  I've been on and off with this guy for 7 years. (Since I was in 1st grade)|`|HhY4Oul2aa	yes of course haveing  a boyfriend at 15 is perfectly ok as long as you dont have sex with him till your older and more amture and ready for any consenquences that may be caused by tha, i was 14 when i had my sweetheart come into my life and we have known and dated on and off for 3 1/2  yrs now, be safe and have a great healthy relationship just dont rush into things i lost my virginity at 16 and its ok but dont rush it i sorta did and i regret it a little but i am glad it was him|`|Ujb6P4gMaa	I don't think so.|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	no i don't believe that's too young; it seems like a normal age.|`|4VDbwLJnaa	nothing bad bout it|`|pVUhlg4iaa	no unless he is wayyy older and/or a bad influence|`|C156l7vWaa	nope its totally fine|`|0dbFAyniaa	as long as you're happy, having a boyfriend is fine.  I personally had a girlfriend at 6, so it's really never too early, as long as you're doing age appropriate things... ;)|`|vVTmJjJDaa	bad? - no, i think it's quite *normal*!|`|UH67GysTaa	no im 15 and its fine. now 12 or 13, thats another story.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Just do not do anything naughty that you may regret later.|`|8Fn1tYaJaa	Nope. Depends on your maturity level.|`|06JnGkd9aa	Um. I don't think so. As long as your parents are okay with it I say. My parents won't let me date until 16, and I can't have a boyfriend until 17. I don't mind though. I'm still getting to know myself.|`|UbSJPBuNaa	i think its fine ive had girl friends since i was in first grade|`|U1e7wJgYaa	theres nothing wrong with it just make sure u can balance it and school work anyway i had a boyfriend since i was 10 years old with the same guy .|`|XnS9mbixaa	im fifteenth years old 2. i have a boyfriend. i also know friends who been going out since the 5th grade. so i think its good for you to have a boyfriend, just dont rush things and keep a open mind. if your guy is as mautre as you say he is your very lucky to have him!   good luck and dont worry so much!|`|smFfcmYuaa	I don't think it's bad. I don't even think that having sex around that age is necessarily bad as long as you use condoms AND birth control. But teen romances usually just end out as nostalgic stories and you're overall better off spending time studying or doing athletics training to get a college scholarship/get into a good school instead of dating. Hell even having a job to earn money is probably a better way to spend your time but studying to get into a private college and go to law or medical school will pay off more in the end financially than any regular job ever would.|`|7XIyslo5aa	I don't think it's EVER bad to be with someone you like and enjoy spending time with. If you genuinely enjoy their company and like being with them, go for it. If they're forcing you into things, that's another story. But you say he isn't, so just have fun! :)|`|b44WwAMsaa	no|`|5gqc5qyzaa	It's fine.|`|3YfYWpAsaa	If he's around your age, then it's fine.  if he's older than 16, its bad. thats date-rape city.|`|qajX3kzPaa	nope it's not that bad   as long as you use your head  and some protection|`|4GmeIopoaa	No it's not bad at all, That's actually pretty normal. As long as there isnt a big age difference and you arent having sex with him it's okay.|`|3Jdm5YuYaa	No its not bad at all.. I'm 13 and I have a boyfriend and I considered this late for my first boyfriend|`|FZMVjKweaa	im a guy but trust me he might be mature but all hes thinking about is how to get in your pants|`|AWoH1oN0aa	thers nothing wrong with having a b/f at ur age its normal...enjoy~!|`|tOx475R0aa	do what he says|`|xCZCJWNraa	ya of course  hahaha  my parents are forcing me to wait till im 16  but its absoulutly fine to start dating|`|p1bpXfb5aa	>>Its okay if you are smart/|`|HFAc8B7saa	innocuous|`|8NbbrVwyaa	No youre not to young. If you like him and he likes you then dont care what anyone else says or thinks. Happy days.|`|4d5c4ad41e20b88fd01b606f0aafeb2caa	yes its he love that matters just DO NOT cross the line to fast|`|8szFciqnaa	Well it depends on how old this guy is. If he's older, then maybe it's a little indecent, but if he's the same age or younger, then that's fine.|`|xu0HiYEOaa	no that's your age group if he was 3 to 4 more years older then you are, then that would be a problem.|`|UODCLHpHaa	NO....every girl needs the practice....by mature do u mean a lot older|`|iSyGrJliaa	Hell no cause den peeps like me couldent get no booty!!!|`|036UU02Caa	Crushing is normal for a 15 year old, maybe even first love. Taking it slow is the wisest decision.|`|9VOdvhvqaa	na its all good|`|QuEU8Mh2aa	its all aboutyour comfort level. if youve been with him for 6 months then obviously you are comfortable. and thats all that matters. age doesnt matter so i think its fine|`|szQugznkaa	Not at all, I'm 18 and have been dating my girlfriend since 12 seriously. No problem with it at all as long as you aren't trying to have an adult relationship yet because it doesn't work "that" way until you become adults.|`|Z716AWZqaa	i don't think so at all. When I was fifteen, that's when I started dating. You're probably a freshman in highschool now, I think it's perfectly fine to start dating. Just make sure you don't rush into anything.
fvANNGmFaa	Are you asking if we'd be jealous or hurt?  Some women get jealous and see it as a challenge to win you back.  Some women get jealous and try to out-do you, aka getting a new hunky boyfriend.  Some women see that and consider you unattainable, give-up.  Some women could honestly care less about their ex's.  And others still (rarely) think "Wow, good for him.  I'm glad he's doing well"
JRM0wwLNaa	Since that's the only time she has said something like that u really don;t know if 4 sure she was telling u that cause she likes u or saying it has a friend way. I usually tell my guy friends i missed them at an event or something. Wait a little longer 2 know how she plays it out.
xCZCJWNraa	uhh ya  hes trying to make the first move but keeps on getting scared or nervous  this is about the time when i would suggest FLIRTING!!!!  hope it helps|`|550eVd5Baa	Yeah, he either likes you as a friend or he Likes you. Another way to tell if he likes you is if he stares at you. Did he do that?|`|AWwtgcuwaa	Usually when a guy likes you he dose stuff like that so there is 100% chance he IS!!|`|BSKJdZK3aa	probably you need to be a friend to him and find out|`|StqGg69Faa	y is everybody always asking this question|`|aDLvzG2Saa	He's either interested in you or very friendly.    Take a hint and get to know him better if you want.|`|U1e7wJgYaa	yes hes definitely into u|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Yes, sounds like he's interested.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Yeah I think he likes you :)|`|BOzWNNS7aa	he wants ya and wants ta be fwiends :D|`|NvoOGU3yaa	yea he likes ya how do i know.i know because that happened to me.|`|ExOwMG2haa	When a guy pays so much attention to you,he probably does. :)|`|vTnUklJ6aa	mabe you smell good he def doesnt like you jk yeah he probably has a lil thing for you :D|`|ZrEbpKZFaa	maybe he just wants to get to know you.
1c3bb798fd0144d7d5b6affc34d84df3aa	I lost mine in early December of '08 with a boy I love a lot. It is not weird, a lot of people our age are doing it. I'm 14 by the way. He is 15, and we are still together. We started going out in late October of '08, so we kinda moved a bit fast. But to tell the truth, from what I heard from my parents and everyone I thought i'd feel different after I lost my virginity. I really don't. If I were to break up with him, I would not regret having sex. I lost my virginity to someone I love. So no it's not weird to have lost your virginity at 14. (I had just turned 14 when I lost it too. Like 14 and 2 days.) Just make sure to use a condom every time. Or at least get on birth control. :)|`|4yhGXh8kaa	No it's not weird, but it's not good IMO.    I didn't loose mine till i was like 20 but that's cause i was in a stupid religion.|`|x0BHrCcoaa	my friend lost her at your age and now shes 2months pregnant...be responsible for your actions
d43pecIkaa	stay her friend because she might not like the guy fore ever and keep telling her the right stuff then eventuality have your chance stay in there|`|iWMvrCFNaa	A girl's best guy friend usually gets the girl in the end. If you support her then  she will realize she really wants to be with you when something goes wrong. THis takes a lot of dedication from you though.|`|xMdKVKTyaa	You need to be completely honest. This WILL be hard (I've been through it too trust me) Just gently tell her if she doesn't feel the same way then stay friends it can happen and that way you don't have to listen to her talk about some guy when it hurts you but you can't say anything so now all the cards are on the table and she'll know how you'll feel and won't say all that stuff about that guy  Just try it can't hurt....
5573832243a1d5e3f002d23bed5be490aa	Some guys just freak at the idea of asking! My best friend was with his girl friend for 8 years and never asked her. Then one night I asked him why he hadn't and he said he really didn't know! The only thing he could come up with was he was scared it would end up the same way his parents did, in divorce. But He said that really wasn't stopping him, he really didn't know how to ask her or what ring she would want, but ultimatly he really didn't know why! So him and I am devised a plan on how he could ask her and I had her sister pick at her about what type of ring and him and I went and got it. They were engaged for 4 months before they got married, she was ready the whole time just didn't want to bug him about it!       if you close with a friend of his, have that friend talk to him about it. Or if all else fails, ask him to marry you! It is 2009 nothing is new or a surprise anymore! HAHA|`|O36qjj7Oaa	If after 9 yrs and 2 kids he hasn't married you yet then he isn't going to.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	you need to ask him. Being honest is very important in every relationship, especially when there are kids.    Tell him your reasons why you want to get married and ask for his - why he does not want to do it.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	talk with him about it|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Maybe he is afraid it will break up your relationship. Guess he saw many great couples ending broken up after marriage.|`|OHydEvTCaa	Truth be told he is sooo comfortable with you that he doesn't feel the need to marry you. Ya know... he's got the milk for free, so he doesn't need to buy the cow (marry you). That's what I think is going on girlie. This man has already gotten you pregnant twice and he has made two major purchases 1. A home and 2. A car, but babe that doesn't guarantee that he will "stay". Don't give up so easily though, have you even talked to him about marriage?Just maybe he doesn't know that you want to get married after all you are popping babies with him like you're playing house! Just giving my opinion. Hope you work things out and pray and turn away form sin!    Have a Nice Night:)|`|0AShsMsoaa	is the "home" with the "husband' in his name only?  why do i bet it is.      and you work to pay half the bills?  so you help pay for " his" house?  like a renter?   and for that you get to be a fake wife to someone who does not honor you.  cause he does not have to.  he has you right where he wants you.  and if you protest the conditions, well, there is the door, and when you leave, it is still !!  his house.  and car, probably too.      marriage is a protection for you and your kids that symbolizes a promise to work with you toward common goals that benefit BOTH of you.     everyone knows that.  you didnt?    shudder.|`|xmRTzE41aa	figure out how long you can keep going without getting married and if you think you cannot handle it anymore than leave because obviously it isnt that important to him|`|c73c9fc0da3874e1d4faac4608c7b448aa	MARRIAGE SUCKS.  dont get mad at me...you asked!|`|54a8ab2a075f3228053ce1f8fb3b394aaa	A few friends of mine finally decided to get married 2 children and 7 years later. They just wanted to make it official and get the same benefits. They never did before because the felt as if they didn't have to be married on paper.|`|7e8NN8saaa	Some guys just can't seem to make that final step to commit - and why should he when you have settled for less than marriage.     I think this ball is in your court. Is this the way you want to go on living?     Oh and BTW - it might help if you quit referring to him as a husband - he is not - he hasn't made it legal - and that's what it is about. He's not your husband. May be a good provider and the father of your children but he isn't your husband.|`|MVxFOI5naa	He does not want to have to legally divide everything he has built with you-in other words the divorce would financially destroy him-or because he is a man and he thinks you want to so then he doesn't want to -he wants it to be his idea -don't talk about it for a while maybe he'll come around or he has a fear of commitment which doesn't seem to ring true since you have been together so long or he is afraid marriage will ruin the good thing the 2 of you have-that's all I've got! LOL|`|iJRcdSbiaa	You're already married in his eyes.  I guess if he realizes how important this ritual is to you, over time, hopefully he'll come around.  Try not to pressure him, he seems like a wonderful mate and dad to his kids.  You're very fortunate.|`|02f1bc31749f26b37d78e2e8ad505a6baa	Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? Sorry, honey. It's a harsh statement, but true.|`|ZtfN4J6taa	Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free ?  Plus I am sure if he were to marry you, you would change right after the wedding. You would stop having sex with him, you would nag him, be bitchy, moody, sexless and just a pain the the behind !|`|CGt4CKPfaa	ask him.. bring it up.. what does he say?|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Because you never made it a stipulation. Since he didn't have to and you didn't speak up, he didn't....and at this point, he won't.|`|e963e45f4749b09ecd59577b4c08368aaa	Did you ever ask him in the past how he feels about marriage?  Perhaps he, like me, does not feel the need as such to make it official, its more the actions and how you feel about the person that matter though, that said, if he does care about you and it means that much to you then maybe you should bring up the subject of marriage and does he see that happening in the near future for you two?      See, while I do not believe marriage is a necessity, my current partner really would like to make it official one day and I have told him if its that important to him, I am happy to do it.      If you have not discussed your wish to make it official, maybe he is just assuming everything is fine so no need.   If you have discussed it tho and he is not keen then you have to ask yourself... is it worth jeopardising what you have by pushing him to do something he does not want to do?|`|S7oxhNnSaa	He has commitment issues.  You need to communicate how important it is for you to have the title of "wife".  I agree with the above, don't call him your husband until he is.|`|vcZZvtXAaa	oh sweetie you've waited to long he is comfortable with the situation he is in now. 9 years, marriage should have been discussed before the first child if not then why not after the child was born. He's never going to you've made it so easy to just lay up.
fEvtIwfbaa	You can't make anybody (or Nobody) love you.|`|AA10649406	its not something you can make someone do, they either feel it or they dont...|`|AA11087845	Ask stupid questions. Oh hang on, you did.|`|BwzcEQcRaa	You can't. I learn a long time ago you can force anyone to do anything they don't want to do.|`|b8uyXOB0aa	You cant make someone love you.  No matter how much you love them.  That is why relationships are so hard and difficult.  It takes two to make it work.

pQsg3EV5aa	Well unless there's something physical going on and all else is well between the two of you, then it's emotional.    Has he talked to his doctor?  Is there something bothering him?  Stressing him out at work, finances?  It could really be anything?    Talk to him to get to root of the problem, if he doesn't know and or can't face it then get outside help from a doctor or counselor.|`|CJZZavCwaa	what i always found fun was to turn him on   tease him a little bit  whisper dirty things into his ear...like things you really miss. make it in a sexy voice though  and while your doing that, just rub his shoulders  and wait for him to show up, and your wearing a skimpy outfit. turn him on, but dont show him that you're actually trying to get him turned on  gotta be secretive about it and dont give in. just tease him  after a little bit of the torture, he'll cave  |`|N9W6v04raa	As much as you may think you know him and can trust him, let me tell you girl that you dont!

Take a hard look at the past 16 months, compare photos if you must.  Do you look different?  If so, then try to get back to the way you looked before.  Another issue could be that the 'sexiness' has been lost.  Do you just get naked in front of him all the time?  I know guys tend to get comfortable when in a relationship, but truly, most of us want the women to be shy and make us work for our prize.

He needed space so that he could hit some other chick and not feel guilty about it. When you break up so many times in a relationship, than it is really time to move on.

I don't (and never will) understand why a man cheats on a woman, let alone propose while cheating!  This must have been such a roller coaster for you and I'm sorry you had to go through this.  In my opinion, make him leave, he's has done enough damage and it's time for him to go!  Based on what he's done in the past, he probably will make up another crappy reason, don't believe him!  You're better and you deserve more then him.  I sincerely hope this helps you and that you make the right choice for you, not him!  If you have any more questions, ask and I'll do my best to answer!  :)|`|r9byb1jEaa	just get rid of him already get a new boyfriend tell him it is over for good  |`|3EoSAWPGaa	It's one thing to cheat on a person, and it takes a lot to get over if you ever really get over it.  But it is another to just sit back and watch him make no effort in improving the situation.  I have made a couple mistakes with my girlfriend and have been lucky she has taken me back because I realized just how bad of a person I had become.  But with me, I want to be the best I can be for my girlfiend and our family, and that is where it seems your boyfriend is lacking.  Give him a choice of getting a job and providing and if he doesn't I would hit the road, you deserve much better and there is always someone who is waiting to treat you right.|`|jnoSmZ4naa	Sounds like its time to move on.  When you keep gettin the same results after tryin over and over, what else is there to expect???|`|C1pfZGZeaa	I know from experience.. my boyfriend cheated on me too and he kept changing his mind and fighting ect. but i took him back 7 times! but i realized it wasn't worth it because it was going to continue to happen so now we are really good friends and we hang out almost all the time. And its just way better that way      It also seems like its going to continue with you..... i would just end it and ask if he would like to stiill be friends ( i know everyone says that ) but it really does happen and if that doesn't work out then it was for the best and there is way more men out there that wont cheat and will love you for you
sY7g3ttPaa	DO A BARREL ROLL!!!|`|1aXaXUYUaa	This is actually a pretty hard situation. But atleast you've learned from your mistakes. What I can say to you is to talk to her. Apologize to her and tell her that this guy is just as fault as you are because he is. An tell all the people that look at you like youre a **** that he is at fault too. If she doesn't accept your apology and keeps doing this crap, then ignore it and move on with your life, Who cares what they think, if the other people were your friends, they wouldn't judge you on this girls prospective. This is exactly what I'de do. Besides! If shes spreading false rumors, shes the low class low life! Also, do something really nice for someone, do something everyone thinks is cool so they will earn your respect because then theyll look at you like you are just as good as them, if not better!|`|knsu9S2Yaa	breath in breath out.  ok u said she was your friend ? just talk to her ALONE  and make sure she understands how u feel about the bulls**t rumours.  this may seem hard in itself, but u gotta get the message across somehow.  if she turned all ur friends against yu, bring them back. it isnt war. but they are your friends and just talk to each of them and tell them the TRUTH!  dont stretch any bit of the story either to make her look bad or to make yu look good. just tell ur friends the whole truth.    explain how sorry yu are. maybe talk to the guy yu hooked up with aswell. if yu can get him to be on your side and believe yu, slowly but surely others will come around aswell.

Anyway, if you are wrong and he doesn't like you more than a friend, it is not the end of the world. The worst he can say is no.  About being straight foward, you want him to like you for who you are. So, if he doesn't like the fact that you can be straight foward then he really is not worth your time.|`|KkQlZTI4aa	If there's one thing that guys like, it's confidence in a woman. I've seen it time and again, and you have got the right idea. Don't be shy to ask him to a movie, and that will also answer your question on whether or not he likes you (you'll be able to figure it out at the movies). Which, by the explanation of his actions, I would say he is attracted to you. The fact that he has never had a girlfriend also outlines why you need to be confident. He has probably dealt with rejection many times and is scared to express how he feels for you. So you go ahead and make the first move, and I'm sure he'll enjoy it! =]
sY7g3ttPaa	Take away his razor blades!    *dun dun, kshhh!!!*|`|12w7YjRTaa	Talk to him. Tell him that he is hurting himself. I have a friend that is a emo. But she got over it by just talking...|`|qjjRW8IGaa	omg i hate emoz dey're like so frikin weird...sorry pple...if ya'll read diz kuestion n read my answer.. but straight up...i hate emoz dey do weird things nd so frikin annoying wit dere gimmie five i hate rock   well talk 2 yall friends   hey u like emoz?  well study...lol|`|OEKW7IKKaa	maybe he's just hurt. instead of sitting there calling him an emo try talking to him and see if something's wrong.|`|xfJmGTOhaa	Call (911) now, hurry before it's too late.|`|Lr7TDhkCaa	Oh my gosh and god [OMGAG], I used to be a semi-emo that would cut her arm almost every week. I used to be all popular until I had... Boyfriend problems, so what my best friend did was try talking to me everyday and make me laugh. And now I feel better and I'm even somewhat more positive too. Don't hate on the emos, everyone is different. They might think you're weird when you're not. So for everyone, don't hate anybody because of personality differences. 
sY7g3ttPaa	Ok|`|8Dr3ofEeaa	there is no way i would give away my AIM to a stranger. Y dont u just post ur hw question on yahoo!answers  o ya  tahts right  u just want to send us a spam or sumtni  ya nice try
qNMfaJ4Raa	This is not common, but it does happen. Most men can get it up within 30 seconds, while some need some extra work. He was probably nervous. It's not your fault.|`|AA11099449	he may have a low testosterone level which can be remedied by medicine to get him up to par. If he has a cold or flu in his system that could also affect him. so don't blame yourself have him get checked for low testosterone.|`|mggRn6Y5aa	Were you naked, stroking, or anything? Do you expect him to just randomly get a *****?|`|R73ShuHuaa	idk what do u look like? is he into u?|`|CjdnBvoyaa	if it takes longer next time and even longer again then it's problem otherwise it would think it's a good thing it means you have 30 minutes of foreplay|`|rulqKfpJaa	its not suppose to take long. maybe he is gay or he has a little dick. maybe me and u can try it|`|eK91MPIIaa	I can assure that many gays love sex with women. Its a funny irony. I know a gay black guy who sleeps with one of his female friends.   He loves men but prefers the feeling of a vagina over a butt.    That aside, it could be anything.    It could be nerves.  It could be he's not turned on or you are turning him off somehow.  It could be diabetes.  It could be anti depression medications.   It could be fear. Fear of making you pregnant or catching a disease from you.     Is it normal to take 30 minutes? Not for a normal healthy guy. I can get hard just walking from my computer to the bathroom If I focus on my dong.     It could be problems with his heart. If the problem persists, send him to a doctor to get his shaft checked out. Whatever the problem is, its usually treatable.
2srWJtjPaa	4 play, not that much teasing cause that's a turn off sometimes, something nice and Sexy, or easy to get in. FUN. KY his and hers always hypes things up.role playing. Sex toys... hope this helps|`|CA80LjBFaa	have a big bed with the lights off.  knock off all the pillows, just leave the blankets.  dress in something sexy and naughty before and have some music in the back round, not too loud though.|`|WypJADCuaa	LOTS & LOTS OF FOREPLAY....TEASEING....|`|kERrZTNNaa	Big bed lights turned off room lit by lamps only (candles are even better). get into something sexy, something that is easy to be taken off Lots of messing before the final act and yeah keep your hair untied|`|AA11099449	take it slow and relax and enjoy, have long foreplay and tell one another your likes and dislikes. and of course let go and enjoy the moment
sTqfKpbraa	hey if you are not ready just leave thuis thing    guys want that most of the times  but you should be sure you want or not  once virginity is gone  it will never come back|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Doesn't sound as if you're too into it. He wants to do it? What about you? Don't be pressured into it. If you don't feel comfortable exposing your "boobs" to this guy, don't waste your virginity on him.|`|MCB1ovEtaa	No hair downstairs...or very very very well taken care of.  As in super trimmed.    Why are you uncomftroable of showing your boobs?  Anyways as for the bra i don't think i would mind    Edit:  Look at mine please?  Need advice|`|AA11447210	You need to be more worried about birth control girl, and STD prevention, than your t*ts showing or pubic hair. Those are the LEAST of your worries when you become sexually active.    If you can't afford medical bills for pregnancy or STD treatment, keep your panties on also!|`|O0pYOOpAaa	Boobs are fine. Let it all hang out.|`|AA11099449	probably wouldn't mind bra on. Very little hair I'd say down there and definitely protection is called for.|`|ZZakBjiNaa	trusttt me, your boyfriend won't care about your boobs. no hair i would think.|`|bUPpi9T6aa	Depends on the positions he would like to try with you|`|HQSV7Crfaa	You should wait you are only 17 don't break to peer pressure|`|7d1d3a67ed94d62c7e9452fca04ffb05aa	You really need to be ready for your first time being a virgin as this could be painful and he needs to be really and i mean really understanding because this may not be as exciting as you think being your first time and he may want to rush in and get it over and done with but this really should be done slowly as it could cause you permanent damage, as for wearing a bra i cant see any bloke minding but he may prefer you to relax and take it off or keep trying to take it off for you and as for the hair i would rather she just tidied it up a little as pubic hair is a pleasant focal point on a girl and having none looks ugly but that's my opinion, trying to get this perfect is probably the wrong thing to do all you need to do is try and have fun and build up to the sex don't just try and have sex get each other horny for a while and slowly remove clothing and as you attempt intercourse remember to tell him to be gentle and to take it slow as you need to enjoy it to and you are a virgin but make sure your ready or  this could turn out to be a really poor experience otherwise, good luck,x
xizhfk4Aaa	lol!He was being dead serious,hun.  Your reaction probably made him nervous.If you would've said "lol,What did you just say,haha"    He wouldve kept it up.    I promise.
5AdVt7dEaa	Practice on the back of your hand.  Yes, with a sucking pull and yes it works.  If even that feels good to you, you know you are on the way.    But when you actually kiss your boyfriend, DO NOT use your tongue.  Alot of boys go 'yuck' the first time that happens until they are experienced.|`|k7jInxBXaa	you just peck them on the lips, or do you mean making out? Then you'd have to stick your tongue in his mouth and you kinda have a tongue war with each other ahaha|`|McGRY4pTaa	tell him the truth ... say i'm sorry i lyed to you  can you teach me how to kiss|`|157d9bda7c1a9422e78b9cd7fc414dc4aa	i did the same thing   but when i told my boyfriend that, i also told him that i wasn't good at it   and that he should teach me how to be better   so i would advise you to do what i did and say it in a flirty way   and with any luck it should work for yu and you will become a pro   i know that i did  :)    hpe it helps  wishing you the best of luck :)|`|fvsMx1Bzaa	i read somewhere that you're suppposed to pretend as if you're saying the word "peaches" silently. like the shapes that your mouth makes when saying that word is how to kiss. But i dunno, I suggest studying actors kiss in movies, hehe. good luck|`|Tej45xhBaa	Awe! Dont be nervous! If i was you i would follow his lead. It will come to you naturally! And since hes kissed 7 girls hell probably know what to do(: haha everyone kisses different! If he sucks on your lip then suck on his back haha. Its fun youll enjoy it! But i think you should tel him straight up and say youve never kissed anyone before hell show you how too!  Dont be nervous he likes you! hes your boyfriend he should understand. he wont make fun of you! Hope i helped(: Good Luck! And have a happy new year!!!!!!!!|`|C16aj18Zaa	idk either.   i have the exact same problem as you.   i hope you get some good answers|`|yVRf4KKIaa	ARe you seriously asking this on yahoo? C'mon???? This is not the kind of question you should be asking the world for....|`|3xf5eW7uaa	open your mouth stick your tounge in massage his and repeat.  i promise you in come naturally.    the only thing you need to make sure of is you dont close your moth to much because you might bite his tounge. that was my only mistake. good luck!|`|jWahLJasaa	One of the most important tips is do NOT kiss with your eyes open.|`|3B5Htymoaa	just part your lips slightly and the rest will come. honestly, its very easy once it starts happening, you'll catch on.|`|XT0JL0C2aa	Kissing comes naturally and when you two are ready, you'll know who to do it so you have two choices. 1) tell him the truth and hope he understands. or, 2) when the time comes, hope that he'll enjoy the kiss and you'll enjoy your first kiss. Good Luck! :D
htsQ6HXCaa	I lub you!    When i want to be cute or dorky, i changed up the word "love", lol:  lob  lub  lubbers  loooov  lukka|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Start with "I like you so much it could be love". See what happens and take it from there.|`|brgewnhRaa	I would just hold his hand... or act shy and submissive... or look at him with a loving affectionate look. When I am in love, I am very submissive and very vulnerable... that's how he knows I love him.|`|caOVvuXtaa	kiss him and whisper in his ear i love you    um its really easy to say|`|Z2poXvz8aa	hmm, I generally tell my bf i love him, or i wuv him, or i wub him haha.   But really I can tell him with my eyes :)))))|`|ZUAFl3toaa	As geeky as it sounds I think saying it online is cute sometimes. Notes are the best though.. just something simple like that. You can always be creative and get something small but thoughtful.. that's always cute. Not expensive stuff but just if you see something little they would like, pick it up for them :) I always get my boyfriend gum balls from this one gas station because he likest hem haha.. random but yeah.|`|H0JnT2Epaa	a note is always sweet|`|xkFIcspTaa	awwwwww  Just say it in a romantic place|`|vijlV3U5aa	I love you a lot, now lets roll around on the ground and have some fun!

Start off by showing him that you love him. Remember, actions speak louder than words. A man falls in love with a girl who makes him feel good about himself. Listen to him as he talks, build him up inside, and be there for him. He will feel like you are special and that you really care. Eventually, he will say those words to you first, which will make both of you happier in the end. But if you truly want to say those words first, be prepared for a positive or negative response. Make him feel comfortable and make sure that the mood is quiet and soft first. Just when he is opening up about anything in particular, let him know how you feel from the bottom of your heart. He will be intrigued.|`|2P1tAxGOaa	I say it in different languages|`|LoIkji4kaa	say i love you with a mouth full of honey?|`|yBCLHp9iaa	I guess you're right. I just never thought about it like that...|`|6aWpH84Taa	because she loves them like she loves sweets|`|TZNFEOB3aa	im not sure i rlly gotta figure tht out cuz im trying to tell a guy i like him but im not sure how to|`|yX4QbqZWaa	wait for a good occasion then tell him straight|`|9jKKkXRZaa	She should say "I like you" with sweet smile, or she should write him a short note that says that;he should read it in front of her.
oCmt5z6Eaa	I've always been more attracted to the kinda girl next door, you know cute and dainty but not overly supermodilish and confident. Confident women always seemed a little stuck up to whoever thier talking too, they just don't seem like fun. I mean I like girls who are motivated and arn't void of self-esteem but also like a girl to be fun and girlish if you know what I mean. It's kinda hard to explain I like girls confident just not over the top confident if you understand what I'm saying.|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	I like confident.  I don't like overbearing or nagging.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	yes i like confident women    but to the point where they are not more confident than me  and im a confident person|`|SjEH1Lx6aa	I think there is a big difference between confident and arrogant.|`|TKwO2R8Qaa	i generally like less confident woman by your definition. still though, confident woman aren't necessarily bad,|`|7QZa9YlLaa	there is a difference to being confident women and arogant women.|`|oTmIoYvUaa	I like a girl that is confident enough  to actually ask someone out and to be confident enough to make a first move. I dunno if a girl with her whole life planned out is right for me but yeah, confidence is a bonus|`|E8hibKH1aa	OMG, i love confident women. That is my biggest turn on!    btw: I was watching The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian last night and Susan's confidence made her so attractive.|`|vj0zTPk3aa	Dr. Popular is 100% correct. Why wouldn't you want a girl who can confidently say that she is a good person, without the validations of others?
5Rn5BHjQaa	Are you sure it's over? If you can't let go, and neither can he, then maybe it's not really over.    If you're absolutely sure you don't want to go back, forget the songs. The less contact you have with him, the sooner he'll be able to get on with his life. The longer you "help" him, the more reason you give him to try to hang on.|`|Efzn69W7aa	Uh....yeah...    Ok, so, here's the deal. If you've really moved on, then you wouldn't be writing this, would you? So, obviously, you haven't moved on.    Secondly, dedicating a song to someone -- do you really think this is going to help him move on? I mean, if he thinks, just SLIGHTLY, that you still have feelings for him and he still "loves" you, then it isn't going to help. At all.    My advice: if you really want to stay with the guy you're with, then you need to distance yourself from your ex because you obviously still have feelings for him. You can't stay friends with someone that you still have feelings for when you're dating another person, because it's just asking for adultery.|`|OwB1qr9laa	message in a bottle by the police , or heartless by kanye wwest|`|653fc76362e70725d8f7dde854d8496eaa	Delete each others numbers and move on.

It always makes it more difficult when they keep talking to you, so just let them go completely, at least for a few months, to give them a chance to remove you from his/her mind, and realize that life goes on without your involvement.|`|K0FabRAIaa	Don't dedicate songs to him in this situation. It will only makes things messier.
AA11099449	They may want to try things sexually they have done with the other woman. Your sixth sense should help you on that. BTW where does your fiancee wash up after his work affairs? If there is nowhere to wash up wouldn't he still have that on him?|`|AA12124669	Well first off, anything is possible. The major sign of a man cheating is that you have a feeling that he is. When they start working late a lot and showing less interest in you is when you get concerned.|`|HGUmFGRHaa	look trhu his fone.. oh and if he dont wanna do it anymore.. probly cuz he already gets enough|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	I'm going to tell you like Madea told the lady in one of Tyler Perry's plays:  The lady asked Madea, "How can you tell if your man is cheating?"  Madea asked, "You think your man is cheating?"  The lady said, "Yeah."  Then, Madea said, "Well, that's how you can tell."  See, when you think he's cheating, he probably is.  I'm a faithful husband although my avatar name might give you another impression.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If a man is going to cheat, he will cheat whenever and wherever he can. Guys can cheat during work hours - there are utility closets, bathrooms, rooftops, etc. At my old building, we used to look out onto the roof of the building next door, and everyday around lunchtime, if it wasn't raining, a couple would go up there and go at it.    The signs of cheating are changing the way he acts around you. You'll notice if his behavior changes|`|VTZojzXIaa	yes. anything is possible. and during work hours is totally possible. signs, watch for changes in his behavior, changes in his routine, changes in bed, if your intuition says he is ...you are probably right.

Comme la majorit des europens sont des moutons assists sans fiert qui disent amen  tout ce qu'ils voient  la tlvision et dans les journaux, ils ne rflchissent pas, ils foncent tte baisse avec un air ahuri.    La propagande mdiatique n'est pas seulement que raciste, elle est aussi sexiste, car c'est montrer que la femme est soumise.      Al tou cour : tu dis dans tes hypothses que les hommes seraient plus racistes que les femmes. Si les femmes noires avec des hommes blancs sont moins nombreuses que les femmes blanches avec des hommes noirs, que penses-tu des femmes noires ? Ne seraient-elles pas aussi racistes si je suis ton hypothse ?  Ton hypothse implique que les femmes seraient toutes aussi racistes. Tu ne l'indiques pas.

Te voy a platicar algo, mi tio mantuvo un matrimonio como 8 a?os con su esposa, y ellos no tenian sexo, pero a pesar de todo se llevaban super bien, eran como dos amigos viviendo bajo el mismo techo y que compartian todo.  Parecian un matrimonio modelo, hasta que aparecio una mujer en la vida de mi tio y dejo a su esposa por ella, con ella si compartia sexo.  No se cuales puedan ser las razones por las cuales no haya sexo en un matrimonio, pero creo que eso pone en riesgo una relacion ya que puede aparecer alguien en la vida de cualquiera de los dos conyuges y terminar con todo.  Definitivamente para rescatar este matrimonio no hay de otra mas que ir a terapia con un sexologo, el les puede ayudar a despertar el deseo sexual y si hay algun transtorno poderlo tratar.  Es importante no dejar las cosas asi, el hecho que las cosas se vean tranquilas no significa que esten fuera de peligro.  Espero haber ayudado un poco.|`|CulCbQeEaa	Pues q esta ca?on ...

VZ1EWdTtaa	En primer lugar, pienso que las personas se deben valer por s mismas.     En segundo lugar, el que una mujer piense que por el hecho de ser mujer o conviviente, la pareja deba mantenerla, creo que en estos tiempos ese tipo de pensamiento no va con la realidad actual; ese pensamiento es una creencia machista; que deriva del pensamiento que el hombre deba trabajar y la mujer deba quedarse en casa.      En cambio ahora, las mujeres piensan en su crecimiento personal, otras en su desarrollo profesional y otras  quieren sentirse tiles en esta sociedad, quieren manejar su dinero y quieren ser independientes y la verdad, ah est el detalle, que la mujer dependa de una misma y que sea independiente.    Los esposos o convivientes por lo general comparten los gastos o buscan un equilibrio.    Una cosa es que digas. (l tiene las posibilidades de ayudarme y no lo hace y a mi me duele porque soy su pareja). Y otra muy distinta sera pensar que el debiera mantenerte porque comparten una relacin de cuatro a?os y en la prctica son como casados.    Yo te felicito por la pregunta; slo las personas que buscan respuestas son las personas que crecen. Yo te recomiendo qeu si necesitas apoyo econmico, se lo pidas como un prstamo; pero un prstamo que se va a devolver.      No hagas caso a las amigas o personas de tu entorno que  seguro te dicen: "es su obligacion, l es hombre, l es  que tiene que mantenerte y la verdad no creo que sea as.      Bueno finalmente, te acosejo que te quieras ms como persona y t seas responsble por tus propios gastos.

If they did they wouldnt cheat. You more than likely were just a sure thing to them, and they could always count on you to be there. No, hard feelings only being honest. They like to have there freedom of being with different women and having someone there to always come home to and be taken care of . You should probably leave those men and move on. Ya, know there are a few good ones out there. You just have to open your eyes. Use these experiences for the future
gzngIhCCaa	I guess you should ask her that.  She probably isn't cheating on you she just puts them just incase or maybe her dad gave them to her so she would be protected or something.  Don't always assume she is cheating on you just because if she has condom.    Try talking to her about it, keep an open relationship.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Unused condoms suggest nothing.  Used condoms would be a bombshell.    You finding them in her dresser speaks volumes. This is about you.   What are your suspicions?  Are you exclusive with this "girlfriend"?  Do you use condoms when intimate with another female?    Gentlemen do not search female dressers.  This is personal insecurity.    Since neither of you is married or engaged cheating is a relatively dubious term.  The claim of some territorial right on the basis of intimacy is suspect.    A guy who does not use condoms because "she told me she don't like them and shes taking the pill" risks STDs and Birth Control Pill failure.  How do you feel about yourself when you entrust intimate risks to someone you don't really trust?|`|vCsSOmVOaa	confront her about it but shes most likely cheating on you|`|AA12359831	if they were unused. then she might just have them for "just in case" situations. and if she doesnt use em with you. why would she use em with anyone else.  just trust her. and stop assuming|`|01yBLHvWaa	it doesnt necessarily mean anything. i used to carry condoms & me & my husband (at the time boyfriend) didnt use them either, but i carried them because it made my mom feel better to "think" we were using them. i mean it can  be a number of reasons though. maybe they are just old.. who knows. but i wouldnt assume the worst. talk to her about it first & let her know it bothers you.
MsSHhX8zaa	I think it's a mutual thing. Some people think guys are more sex-minded too, but they're usually just more vocal about it, that's all.    I feel so safe when my guy's arms are around me...whether we're cuddling or just hugging, whatever. And kisses make a girl feel special ya know, no matter what kind of kisses, but I especially like it when my guy kisses me on the forehead.    But guys crave all that physical closeness too. My guys usually the one that kisses me first, or reaches out to me. It makes them feel wanted and special as well.|`|tAmFjEflaa	hell ya!|`|5FCiKNaGaa	some times, i guess it depends|`|qSsx4oD8aa	uhh yeah.   but still sometimes the girls want to do it too.|`|E5iS8g7taa	idk it depends on both of them|`|cb4HEkGhaa	i think that we need each other equally|`|R3dk8fC1aa	it changes.     when a relationship is healthy, its normaly the girl who wants it more.  when the guy wants it more, theres a high probablitily he wont handle it properly and the girl will dump him.|`|o8E9wsPCaa	no i think its both ways. Sometimes girls can get really desperate lol  but boys r always horny and some girls can be too|`|CEKZsoFRaa	Of course they do, if it weren't for girls, there would be no boys!|`|zIQ9DuYyaa	Yeah thats probably true.|`|AA10652271	yes|`|gbkMBA2raa	we need the ladies more though we front and say no but try to dance with another guy and see what happens but when girls dance with each other its cool|`|utQC6dhjaa	yeah i can be completely satisfied with just hugs and kisses  making out is fun too but i really don't need more than that  i think guys are just little more anxious then us girls  but there are some crazy girls out there so who knows

JYgJD0Rwaa	An uncontested divorce means you both agree to the divorce, and all aspects of it. Its completely different from an annulment (which is a way to dissolve a marriage making it so that it never happened). Annulments are difficult and require your marriage to fall under some pretty specific issues such as duress, fraud, polygamy, etc.  If you and your husband agree to the divorce then you can do it yourself, without a lawyer.|`|GLwFUEDkaa	an uncontested divorce is where the other party has no problems getting the divorce, find a lawyer, or go legal aid and they can help you with what you need, if they are not helpful call an attorney and ask questions, they can help for sure, you can try for an anulment good luck|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	An uncontested divorce means you both agree to dissolve the marriage without a lengthy court battle to fight over who gets what.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Depends on the state. Most states have a version of a "no-fault divorce". Some have longer waiting periods than others. Anyone can file for a divorce, by visiting the County Court, filling out the form(s) and paying the filing fee. Then you go through the process, however long, and a ruling is issued. In your case, with no property to divide, it should be pretty simple. If it is contested, then you should consult an attorney. An annulment is usually only available when there has been some kind of fraud associated with the marriage... some kind of misrepresentation on the part of one of the parties, which includes failure to consummate the relationship.|`|99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	Okay, you file for divorce and if he doesn't try to stop it, doesn't want to bother with attending the hearings, THEN it's uncontested.  You don't get to pick it...it just means he's not going to try to stop it.    I'm pretty sure he'd have to agree to an annulment as well.      Just go to an attorney, and get the paperwork going.|`|AA10248966	See a divorce lawayer immediately and try for annulment based on what you found. Xerox everything. Write out complete anecdotal records. Lose him fast. If he fights it, sue for divorce and keep everything.   You cannot get an uncontested divorce unless he fails top contest it.|`|351cd68a64200905aea88f74e7661159aa	In my state to be an uncontested divorce the couple must file jointly and agree on everything.  You can file for divorce and he does not contest it, it is still not considered an uncontested divorce.  It is a matter of legal definition.  Talk to an attorney, and see which would be easier, a divorce or annulment.  The easiest thing would be asking your husband and see if he would agree to an uncontested divorce,
TJiGs8S4aa	I think you are closer to the truth than you realize.  I think that your mom has a mental health problem - probably clinical depression.  It wasn't until I got much older and started treating my own mild depression that I realized my hyper-perfectionist, picky, depressive mom probably had depression too.   Unfortunately, she would never seek treatment...  But it is not too late for your mom.  Next time you have a convo with her and she unleashes on you with negativity, just say to her in a perfectly even, level, matter-of-fact tone, "mom, I'm concerned about your health.  I think you have depression.  It is so easily treatable, and you are missing out on so much in life.  Please see a doctor. " In fact, that can be your stock phrase every time you talk with her, if you continue.  I believe there is something clinically wrong w her.      Look, I'm sympathetic to you - it DOES stink - but it sounds to me as though (mercifully) you have grown up and have come to terms with it and have a supportive family of choice.  Don't worry too much about other peoples' imaginary "normal" moms - trust me, there are a lot of drug addicted, alcoholic, abusive dysfunctional moms out there.  You have what you have - and only you can decide if you want to deal with it.      You *don't* need to defend yourself.  In fact, you don't even need to engage with her on her level.  You CAN take control of the conversation.  I tried that with my hyper-negative, picky complaining former MIL - told her "my complaint window was permanently closed".

aVs1mu3laa	He didnt reject you silly, he just wasn't in the position to be able to say yes.  He'd already started something with another girl, so he can't just up and leave and hurt her, he obviously is interested in you but just has to take care of business the right way first.  The reason he's talking to you so much is cause he wants to form a connection now so that when he's available, you can work on being together, it'd just be too complicated for him to run off on the other girl at a minutes notice.  It seems like he's more interested in you though darl, dont write him off, I dont think you really have a reason to be heartbroken just yet...|`|paZpnQ5daa	He obviously realised that he really appreciates and needs you as a friend.

aed346b98c6b5137e179dd43247b37ebaa	Love is an emotion, defineing emotions are always difficult. The fact that there is also different forms of love also makes it difficult to define.     I believe most love starts as infactuation, that is when you first feel you could love someone, you want to spend every minute you can with them, when you are around them it is life you are on drugs or something, they make you feel happy and good. As you spend more time together and get used to having eachother around, the newness of infactuation disappears, and that is when true love develops. True love, is much harder to define, it is as intense as infactuation at times, but ebbs and flows, there is always that sense of connection, and understanding. You know that he leaves the toliet seat up, or he doesnt call you back right away that drives you nuts, but you know that it is okay, because you love the person he is, even the ugly parts.     If any of that made sense good on you, if not then perhaps what you need to ask is What is not love? It is always easier to define something by what it is not.|`|iBcj45P9aa	Love is a choice.  If you want to prioritize him over other important things, then you love him.  Don't make it any more complicated than that.  Yes, there is such a thing as chemistry.

If you are really new, maybe insert a note into his locker with your name and picture on it saying that you want a quick tour of the school sometime. Write 'Please write back.'

lcKjQo2maa	Zim, you sound incredibly young, you don't know everything about why your father lost custody. You only know what you have over heard or what you have been told. The details that cause a parent to lose custody are not taken lightly. The judge had to look closely at the details in order to render a decision. I am very sorry but to advise you without knowing why you were taken out of his custody in the first place could be harmful to your well being. Try the question again and divulge a little of reason why your not with your father now. Pray about your wants and desires, if it is the Lord's will that you be reunited with your father it shall come to pass. What makes you want to go live with him so feverishly anyway. Does he give you your way and spoil you more than your mom? That is no reason to chance your well being. Just see if there is some way you can start spending more time with him now that your older. Don't forget to pray first, peace will come.|`|AA10943329	depending on your age you get to choose.

pdVegnQCaa	What is she thinking?    A better question is what are you thinking?    Dude the problem is not with her the problem is with you!    The problem is you have no game and you think very little of yourself. Imagine a life where you can meet many pretty, nice and intelligent girls that seriously like you and want to be around you and with you.    Sounds good doesn't it. Guess what you can have that, it's just that you don't know it. There are so many cool and nice girls like that out there also having a tuff time meeting a nice guy but you have shut them out. You need a big dose of self respect and confidence.    This is what women like in a guy, a general sense of confidence and a great sense of humor. Now you might not be a GQ model that doesn't matter, if you have a great personality girls will dig the sh-t out of you. Be conversant talk to girls stop worrying about what they might think. Yes some of them might think that you are an itiot... Who cares, next? If you talked to 100 girls and 98% percent turned around and walked away it means that you made 2 new friends/girl friends. If you did that every week, in the first month you would have 8 GF's. In a year you would have more chicks than you know what to do with. It doesn't even matter what you say you also need to act like you don't care if they answer you or not, think of funny clever things to say. You will be surprised at the attention that you will get back.    The first thing you need to do however is STOP talking to this attention whore, she is using you as her parachute. In case the fools that she has been with leave her she has you as her security blanket. She figures old idiot you will be there so why worry? Stop taking her calls if she does happen to get through tell her that you want nothing to do with her! Talking to her is painful for you and it is only dragging you down. Tell that ****** to get lost and out of your life. You are wasting your valuable life on someone who isn't worth pile of sh-t.    You could be having sooooo much fun, instead you sit at home stare at a picture of the ho and cry. Stop living in the past and live TODAY.

DZjMtC31aa	in my school system, we get that twice. fifth grade and eighth grade. in fifth grade, we were separated but not eighth. it's a maturity thing... plus, it's good, at a certain age, to learn from each other as well, and you develop a sort of comfort. sex is something real, and they're going to have to confront at one time or another, and when they do, it won't be (in most cases), with the same gender. plus, my eighth grade education helped me realize boys are still as gross as they were when I was 4... so i wasn't going to even go down that road any time soon.|`|cW6kkcV1aa	Hey!!!

CnuwupbOaa	Ask them a question, "How is it? I tried to pick out what you liked." Be sure to ask what their personal opinion about it is. Don't impose you own.     Whenever you give someone a gift you should never expect something in return; it was a gift. You're showing love, respect, and gratitude. If you don't want to look or sound like you're bragging just think it through before you say anything. You kinda bragged in this question too ("thoughtful huh?")
CnuwupbOaa	Don't converse with mom about it. Obviously your mom was inviting him with her behavior. My question is why does your boyfriend meet her half way? He could just ignore her flattery, but for some odd reason he didn't choose to. There has to be some level of trust between the two of you. Even if they were conversing about you it shouldn't have to be behind your back. Talk with your boyfriend about that. If he says you're just jealous tell him that you have the right to be jealous. You deserve an explanation other than what you have already observed. You need to be in the loop of things, especially considering that you've brought them 'together'.|`|YHM5giYVaa	Maybe your mother's doing it because it makes her feel young again.And maybe he's talking to her because he thinks  it's cool to talk with a older lady.Either way it has to stop. Right now your being disrespected by them both and that's not right. You have to speak up and tell them you don't like them talking on the phone. If it continues after you tell them that your uncomfortable with them talking, let him go.And don't let your mother met your man until your sure his 100% commited to you.He does not need your mother's help to send you flowers.|`|7qRFw5fjaa	OMG|`|fCF7tZ4qaa	your mother is really immature and sick if you ask me....|`|AA11197832	OMG, thats crazy its sounds to me she likes him.

c39dde8f5ee7d9c29d508c5b00fc93beaa	If you want any relationship to work, you have to be happy with being with yourself.  Be patient and enjoy the time you do get to spend together.|`|f5307d7527d5232ae0791280a9de6b4aaa	Not sure what your question is but if I were you I'd break up with him. Sounds like he really isn't interested and if he is he will come chasing after you. If not then you know the truth.    God Bless!|`|E5Oxk2exaa	well you should tk 2 him if you both want this relationship you gotta stop doing things to make him not trust you (what i a relationship without trust) but he has to meet you half way to and if he is busy its not his fault but you both need to spend time together and maybe you should find something to do aswell.|`|zaGu158kaa	your messed up. can't help|`|AA10839612	Life cannot be just about you and your boyfriend over there.

Ask him?????|`|mS6DhI4uaa	He is attempting to tell you he just wants you for sex romantically. If your going out first ask him what he means just to make sure.   I would dump him.|`|4skV5lfFaa	it means he really doesnt.    eek. i realized that sounded harsh. it means that he doesn't really know what that is, so maybe you should love isn't the best thing for you two.|`|gRVqKO9xaa	he wants to noe what your comfortable with and feels good and what you like|`|KPqdTqdxaa	It means he thinks your Hot, but doesn't really dig who you are. He wants to stay around because your fine.|`|SzbWT2Exaa	It means he wants you to show him what pleases you sexually, what makes you feel good and what things are a turnoff to you. Each women is different so he needs to be intimately taught what to do. You might thing that all it would take is for him to read your mind and "just know" what to do but it doesn't work like that communication is key and your door needs to be opened.|`|N6X5rkWQaa	a. he wants to have sex with you.  b. he's lazy to find out on his own and wants to have sex with  you.  c. he's screwed up past relationships and wants to have sex with you.  d. all of the above.|`|jJc99nHcaa	He wants to know what you like.......

Yea, you made a mistake...deal with it...learn from it, move on.  Hope for the best, but be ready for the worst also.  Karma Karma Karma that's what I have to say.  You do something to someone and something will be done to you.  So, to be true to you, and him TELL HIM NOW!!!|`|xVaFN2Cqaa	well i don't get u.be plain and direct.
c61dc462aa8c782b3fa296b8ed691d7baa	I hink you should approach her about her attention seeking behaviour.  If she's genuinely sorry and stops trying to manipulate you in such a way, then you should stay with her, but if she keeps this up dump her.|`|78fc8bc2259086fa893dc874f9f06ecdaa	Forgive her -she was missing you and felt neglected by you so tried to make you jealous.  It's hardly a major thing.   As your relationship progresses and she feels more secure in it she'll stop exaggerating these things.  Maybe she felt you didn't care whether she went out with another guy or not.  I think there are issues here with both of you and if you really care about her you should look to fix the issues with yourself as well as with her.    If you don't care about her then dump her and let her find someone who does.|`|ae37c99557d25fa9faac61ad71b92eb3aa	One word for you....psycho.|`|c88hdjeRaa	Well trust me,i presonally dont think u should dump her.Girls like to have all ur attention on them. If you dont want that, then dump her. She kinda had a good reason but i wouldnt of chose to lie to you. But talk to her, and see what she has to say. Then if u still feel like u want to dump her, then do it.|`|McWF8xmcaa	Well you said it your self... she felt ignored...break it off because if you truely loved her you would rather respect her feelings over a guy hang out. Unless you planned the trip way before you met her or knew she felt that way.|`|IBYWKE0saa	I think she was just very upset that she wasn't getting the attention she normally gets from you. How long will you be away on vacation? Give her a few days to get used to not seeing you and I'm sure she'll be fine. I would just reassure her that you love her and such. Hope that helped :)|`|V0GGHx3eaa	she just needs reassuring that you really love her....I'm sure you heard of the term "negative attention"..it's when a child acts up or lies to get your undivided attention..this is what she is doing..you need to show her more affection...start including her in your day to day activities..let her know that she is needed and wanted and the lying will stop..if not and after you've given her all of you....she might have an issue which therapy would help ...but I think it's the negative attention
RkWslZTaaa	I know it seems like an eternity but she will be back soon... Keep busy by hanging out with other friends and going to do things, rather than just sit around... Also if she has internet access email back and forth, that way you keep the communication going while she's gone.|`|cGeEIU2jaa	I miss my friend to and she is just goin to be gone for a lil while and then come back. she is only in a different state and she has only been gone for 1 day.  It just happens i guess. and then when you see her you can tell her " don't leave me ever"!  lol  bye bye|`|5xm6pS2Saa	Aww that's too bad! It may seem like a while, but she'll be back before you know it! Just hang with your other friends for now until she comes back. Then all you girls can get together for a huge sleepover! I know you guys are really close, but she'll be back, she won't stay there forever! Just keep that in mind.|`|OIsuxfeHaa	Just chill with other friends and if you have alot of fun you will probably pass time fast.Just calm down about her!Please,dont stress.She is probably missing you very much to.Just have some time and patience!hope i helped!    P.s. Email and contact her by Phone or Computer!shell be back.it is not eternity...|`|lDui06ZXaa	I know exactly what you feel like. Its hard when your best friend moves away. Is there anyway you can communicate? Long distance calls are expensive, letters take a while to arrive. Can you two email each other?|`|S8pDHnXaaa	girl relax..i know how hard it can be but just say to ur self i will see her soon
ox4MdqcVaa	Well, with most girls, any compliment woould really make her feel great. If you want to compliment her, (if you guys hang out) then you can just say something like you have really nice eyes. I dont think compliments can really go wrong cuz most girls love to get compliments, especially from guys.|`|jm8dWbKraa	When you look her in the face next time you are talking to her just say "I nerver noticed before but you have really beautiful eyes!"  Us girls love compliments of any kind! Always remember that! Try to make it sound casual.
yF7AdqIzaa	He can embrace the German, non-Nazi side of his heritage if that would make him feel beter. I'm related to Schutzstaffel (SS) officers, a German Armeegeneral, and Joachim von Ribbentrop. But that doesn't make me Nazi, in fact I have friends who are Jewish.    And being Nazi does not mean you hate the whole world. It doesn't mean you have to hate anyone. It is the belief that you and your brothers are above all else, and that Juden and mischilinge are unworthy of your pity and should be disposed of.    I don't remember reading anything about Nazis having anything against Philipino people . . . I believe that Jews and African Americans were their main targets. I know they asked Iraq to ally itself to Germany but that's off-topic.|`|sy4h7rL1aa	Well most Nazis were raised to believe these things, like from BIRTH...When he went to school, they were teaching this too. He was most likely raised to be a Nazi, never actually got a chance to see what everyone else had to say. And Your friend isn't the Nazi, he didn't do any of that, and I know your friend doesn't think like that. He shouldn't be walking around saying my grandpa was a Nazi, all proud like, that's gunna get him dirty talk, and rumors....No one should be proud for what the Nazis did, no body should ever be, but there is no use being all ashamed for what you family did in the past. It is over now.    Basically I am saying don't be proud, and don't be ashamed. You are your own person...your friend I mean      He should be proud of being German, they have done some awesome things.|`|iAyGdSvzaa	if he is ur friend u should not be scared, yes he should be proud of his heritage, every1 should be|`|5dfq7G1Daa	Unfortunately, the ****** Hitler stole the Swastika from the Hindus for whom the sign is a symbol of love and peace. reason why it isn't illegal. As for whether you should be friends with him or not, it all depends on whether you believe in the **** he believes in. And I'm not sure of your question, does your friend believe in the stuff as well? or does he believe in the Nazi belief. If he does then I'd personally be running in the opposite direction. If not, you can't blame him for the family he had. But I'd still be careful.. I mean you don't how many racist ppl are linked with the family.. what if they decide to do away with you? Personally I wouldnt be comfortable at all with a person with that kind of background. But if you feel comfortable with him and since you know him better than me, only you can be the judge of that.|`|xh4EVgHdaa	his grandfather may have been a Nazi but that is not a heritage.His heritage is German.and yes he should be proud of his heritage.Are you proud of your heritage?you live in a country where the Prez is the most dangerous man on the planet and has started wars with lies.i don't consider that your heritage.|`|DrNvsYzuaa	Sorry, unfortunately, evil isn't going away any time soon.  If I were in your position and I told my father of this friend, and I told my dad that I wanted to be faithful to this friend, my father would disown me, just like that.  Even though this guy seems to be a nice guy, underneath it ( and not too far underneath) is a mind taught to hate anyone who is not just like them; sounds a lot like the Islamic extremist of today doesn't it?  If I were you, I'd run, as fast as possible.

zuYcpKeJaa	Honestly, it does sound like it has a lot to do with where you are living. If this is somewhere  where you've been for a long time (and not someplace he just moved into) Then  you might want to ask him what it is that's bothering him... there might be something going on at work, maybe he doesn't like the people he's working with or his boss is too tough... My best advice is that you should talk to him, let him know that you're there for him no matter what. One thing that we as women need to remember is that even men need someone to talk to and a shoulder to cry on. Hope this helps.. it's what i would do.. Good Luck!|`|tfqpb5XQaa	well, maybe it is where he's living and his job.  or maybe he has other problems that he hasn't told you about, which would explain the drinking in some people.    if i was you, id just talk to him about it. cause no one else knows the whole story and no one else can give you the right answer about it except him. tell him how worried you are and that you're not gonna feel better until you know the truth|`|hyqf7xR0aa	to answer your question: yes, I'm sure that someone out there is prepared to help you.    |`|8TAeFGSJaa	talk 2 him tell him how u feel,it doesnt always helps but you will feel better and know what to do!  and i dont think its you! he has sum problem that hes gotta deal with!!  my husband started drinking seriosly after i lost our baby! men dont know how to deal with problems so they start using drugs and start drinking so the problem 'goes away' but tell him u r there for him watever hes going thru!  good luck|`|SupWrLRIaa	He is experiencing depression resultant from his living situation and work-life, as you say. (lowercase d, not uppercase D; difference being that one is an extreme form of sadness and the other is a medical condition caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain) He is attempting to make himself feel better through drinking, and is pulling away from you for two or possibly three reasons.     The first reason is that this is an instinctual reaction to sadness in many people. No one truly knows why, it just is. The second is that he loves you and doesn't want you to be hurt by his personal issues. He is trying to protect you by distancing you from what he is going through. It is a bad idea, but it is also a very common one among people who are truly in love.     The third reason, and this one is a bit more . . . optional? For lack of a better term? It is a bit more open to interpretation or outright dismissal. It is possible that he resents you for keeping him where he is. He doesn't like it there, and the only reason he is stuck in that situation is because he wants to be with you. While it is obviously his decision to stay there, it is still possible for him to resent you for making him decide. It is not logical, which is to say that he has never attempted to apply logic to it and so has no control over it. It is entirely possible that he doesn't even know that he is feeling this. Many people have little to no idea what is going on inside their own head, unfortunately.    In the end, my point is this: You need to make him feel better. Which is not to be confused which cheering him up, which is the quickest and easiest way to drive someone who is sad or depressed away. I know that from experience. You need to help him either deal with the problems he has, or simply do away with them by moving to another city with him, or suggesting that he do so by himself. If he moves somewhere relatively close, you can see each other every bit as much as you do now (4 hours a week isn't hard, after all lol). He just cannot keep living like this. He is going to self-destruct, and you are going to be one of many to pay the price.|`|qGQUZM90aa	Tamara it's impossible to love someone after such a short time, I think you are getting like and love mixed up. This guy sounds very selfish and you sound very confused. Remember a new brush always sweeps clean and my advice would be for you to sweep this guy under the carpet, tell him to sling his hook and let him go.. What you have to realise is this guy is full of his own importance, you are just classed by him mind you as a bit on the side to amuse him when he has no money and his friends, so called drinking buddies are not around. Look he's a loser, toss him to the kerb now or you will live to regret it.. |`|hHndD5SEaa	hun having problems this soon into a relationship isnt good.. you should still be in the honeymoon period.  it does sound like he really loves you in the fact hes prepared to stay in a town he hates, but I think doing this will have even more negative effects on him. Hes obviously miserable in his job and parts of his life and these are now affecting his love life.  Im not sure what to advise you here - moving might solve things, I really d ont know.  xx|`|90aaa7bdb4ac0817ea4a4b6eea86a7fcaa	he is a loser who hates himself.  he has to love himself before he can love  you.  dump him.  he is wasting your time  |`|wKClhBpeaa	Tell him how much its hurting you.  If he really does love you, he'll make some changes to his life and see you much more often.    It could be that he doesn't truly love you, and that is shown through his lack of spending time with you, and rather with his other friends.    He could be getting bored with the relationship.  Either way, you have to get his attention back.  If he continues to hurt you, and neglect you, then he doesn't deserve you.  |`|AA10983590	he's probably sleeping around and using the negativity to shelter it...what can I say, men are evolving to better liars...look at Tom Cruise|`|AA10094140	I think u need to talk to him  if your in a relationship u should be able to talk  but i feel u im in a similar situation when this is over im taking a break from women maybe u should do the same|`|c94a1a3eae0ddbe88db02ce381b21b57aa	leave him fro his other four women or worse are getting about the same amount of time. your time is worth more than four hours   a week there are at least 24 hours ina day and he sleeps about four  that's 16 hours he is spending where? with others than you and the bed. 16 hours he could have been watching the tv with you or helping make a nice spaghetti dinner or just spending time with a deck of cards  or a board game with you next to him not with you guessing he is being a unfaithful male like allot of the young ones are his hormones are raging and he has got them to tend too. since your not his only  time keeper don't be hurt and used your feeling are worth more than that, cheers  What would the man upstairs want in my life to do.  cheers.  |`|JEECTFUwaa	 well first off I lost a friend from drinking;drinking is not ok:excuses is another one;what do you want out of a relationship of 4 hours a week;  you must consider your happiness as well as his: He is happy getting drunk; what will make the light bulb come on,for you to realize it will not be the same as the beginning, it never is: I do not mean to be mean, just real as all hell: on this subject you are talking to a pro"believe me, :|`|TdYg6gZMaa	Yes , your situation is critical but in live there is no boring at all, first of all you just be faithful to him and tell him about your position as you are in dilemma be there for him always.

Time is the greatest remedy for any relation.|`|5KcUyLFRaa	Its probably a mix of two things - not liking work and the town you both live in is definitely gonna drag him down, make him a bit depressed, and unenthusiastic for anything in life (which could explain the going out getting drunk and doing not much else). Also, with some people, they get stuck in a rut with relationships. They take for granted that the person they're with is gonna stay with them, and because of that no longer feel the need to make an effort with them.  Have you told him how hes making you feel? Because it may be the kick up the bum he needs to realise what hes doing to your relationship.|`|5GtDgQX4aa	Leave him.  He is just going to make you depressed to sitting around wondering if he really cares about you.  If he really loved you he would see you more often than 2 times a week.  breakup with him so he can leave the town if thats where his heart really is.  |`|GuRluYmraa	the best thing to do is sit down and have an open and honest talk with him. Tell him how you feel and say that you are concerned that things have changed so much. Hopefully he will set you straight with how he is feeling. it seems like he is not telling you something, you said he seems depressed over work. Perhaps he feels like its a dead end job and that he needs something bigger and better to show his potential. Just talk with him. |`|tHf7t4kVaa	maybe its just stress but i think u shud investigate b4 jumping to conclusions.|`|VwmqpqHiaa	ahh.  i wouldnt like it if i saw my boyfriend only twoce a week for two hours.  if he loves you as much as he says he does then he would make the effort to come and see you or whatever.  i think that you should sit down and speak to him :).  you cant keep going on like that.  you'll start to feel as if you second best.  as if going out and getting drunk is so much better than spending time with the person you love, eh?  you deserve better than that chick,  sit down and have a good chat with him, im sure he would understand.  tell him you want things to be like the way the were when you first got together as you felt loved, and as if he wanted to be with you :). x|`|pMEeXapzaa	The novelty of you has worn off, he wants to drink likes his mates at weekends, you fill 4 hours midweek, this suits his new lifestyle. Move on life's to short.|`|JltE5LIHaa	It maybe time to make a clean break. As hard as this may seem it seems to me that he is using you as break from his mates. If he is so depressed where he is living and with his job the only person who can change the situation is him.   I don't think he is the settling down type so not the guy for you. Ask yourself if you are truly madly deeply happy with him. If the things he does and the way he treats you do not make you happy then move on to someone who deserves all that you are willing to give, he is out there. Good luck.|`|96ULApwcaa	It isn't you, it's not the relationship- but its just you bf is genuinely unhappy with where he is and what he's doin!  He obviously cares for you as he's stayin in the area for you. But in the long run he's only going to get more and more depressed with his situation.  I think you have to let him go, maybe he'll realise what he's lost while he's gone.    But if you love him then you'll want him to be happy even if that means not being with you |`|SNuIxTEUaa	Eish! my girl I feel for you, what i can say is that your man is a player he is nw inlove with another girl, or maybe somehow he is not safisfied about the way u re now.

YVE64dJUaa	yes its normal but you need to get over the jealousy and clinging onto something that ain't there if you tried an intimate and that failed and also tried friends and that failed then face facts and move on    not saying its going to easy i've been there trust me, but it is what you need to do|`|I2YUzjQ8aa	Thats never an easy thing to go through.

People move on, that's the sad fact of life.  It doesn't mean he doesn't care about you, the fact you tried being friends shows he does because he doesn't want to lose you in his life.  It might just mean you weren't the right people for each other, no matter how great you both are, however much you care about each other...sometimes people just don't work together.  I hope things work out for you, just try keeping yourself occupied with your friends and family.  Pull in the things that mean a lot to you.  Maybe in time when you're both over things you can try the friendship thing again.|`|h8iaQMS2aa	its called the rebound period. its helping him get over you

AND THTS GOOD..ALL THE VERY BEST....:-)|`|0v6lMl4Kaa	If you're both ready and you've obviously moved past the 'let's spend time together' phase of dating, seeing as you already know each other pretty well. There are two ways (in my experience) to make the jump:  1) Snog him. That's pretty much the other side of the friend line. There usually isn't any going back.  2) Do something different together. Don't just 'hang out'...go out on a date.     I can't tell you that you'll be friends if this doesn't work out, I have had experiences that went both ways. But it always depends on how honest you are with each other and how sensitive you are to each others' emotions. |`|94d291305716f5597e7eadb25705bcf4aa	!) The way to make that jump is for you both to understand the emotions that are between the two of you and what you would like to be the next step.(might be awkward at first), but you never how wonderful it may turn out ,because who can understand what you need in a relationship Better than your own friend. 2) From my own personal experience of dating my best friend for a period of 3 years (break for college) it was a wonderful relationship because since we were/ae best friends we could talk about whatever to one another HOWEVER the breaking point was that it wasn't like we'd ever changed from best friends to GF & BF which in the affect inn/physical department hurt mepersonallyy, but in the end we'restill friends. so really its usually worth the  risk, just make sure you both come to an understanding beforehand|`|AA11099449	Go on a date and talk about how you want things to go see how it feels if it's not right then back off.

You're just going to have to use your discernment while you hang out with her.   and the fact that you're black and she's white does not matter at all.|`|R9pkNNSmaa	she wants your brown sugar. all white people act like they do not like it but they do. secretly that is. color odes not matter just get to know her and see where it goes. ooo brown sugar listen to the song by the rolling stones btw.|`|MNsBPXhRaa	This is your life dude, forget what others think.

0RRNIDamaa	idk any characters! lol haha|`|Zdj6wmaiaa	I haven't read those so I am going to say Edward :-)|`|QIqPwcH6aa	those of us who have REAL lives don't have to worry about having sex with percey's mom
LqulvCsoaa	It could be the stress from moving away that made her change. I would let her adjust to her new environment. Give her time and call her up. In time she probably won't even remember you said that.|`|DhTz587Uaa	she just needs to grow up|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Well when we move and get new friends, new environment, we do change. Some times it is for the better and to others that are left behind it is true that they are not the same person. It isn't that you don't care for them, but they have changed from when you where together all the time. We all change when we are put in a different atmosphere, so she shouldn't be hurt from what you said.|`|LGmLjn5xaa	Say " I am the one who should be mad at you because if you were a real friend you would talk it out with me and forgive and forget! I still love you and I hope we can be friends, there is nothin else I can do about this, I take back what I said and I am sorry! Please forgive me! I did my part about solving this problem now it is your turn!"|`|bfcX31ERaa	Tell her that you were just trying to help and that the point of view you saw it at and you were not trying to be mean to her also ask her why she has bean that way?|`|qb23ebljaa	i knw wat u mean..ive had friendship troubles lately..just call her..and say something "i didnt mean it like tht..i meant tht ur just different then u used to be..but ill always be ur friend..everyone changes" thts wat i would do|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, I will just tell her not to get mad, is just a rather of an opinion of yours and she should just understand and not to take it to the heart you know, it is how you feel, but if anything if things still are hectic, then just let it go, when she realizes--she will come back, and be like Oh, I'm sorry I acted this way & such, you understand?<br>  <br>  I hope I helped you <33
Pgl8v1Vcaa	Having an innocent crush while being married is totally normal as long as you don't act upon it.  Like the saying goes, "you can look at the menu, but not taste it" something like that.  He's just a fantasy to you just like someone would idolize or admire a celebrity.  It's an infatuation that you will eventually get over.  Trust me, your husband also looks at other women and may think they are beautiful too.  You barely know the guy in your class and had no kind of interaction with him. If you say you are in a happy marriage then you probably won't act upon your fantasies.  Use that energy to spice up your love/s*x life with your spouse.  <br>  <br>  The random dream was merely from your inner conscience because he was someone that you thought was attractive and that he took notice of you. That was just so exciting for you.  It's just a crush.  You will get over it.  I hope you and your husband continue to be happy.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Your experience is a very normal behavior.  Human are NOT sexually monogamous, i.e. desiring to have sex with only one partner for life.  <br>  <br>  That means, once in a while, we will fantasize about having sex with someone else other than the partner.|`|eca5081cf1a52165be5f0e9110f9d187aa	If you don't have any children, I suggest you end your marriage.  It would be the right thing to do overall.  LOVING someone is NOT the same as being IN LOVE with someone.  You are not in love with your husband.  Marriage only gets harder as time goes by.  If you are already having this level of problem, you really should plan the best way to "remedy" this error with the least amount of damage to all.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Maybe your sex life is boring. Try to spice things up a bit with your husband, with sexy lingerie, a romantic getaway or a candle lit dinner. Marriage takes work. Put the spark back into your marriage and you won't have the time or inclination to fantasize about anyone else.|`|8118f09d36adb267002b8f6671e634d3aa	It's totally normal and it happens all the time. It's the actions that you take (or don't take) that matter.|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	if you have a crush on someone.....run and dont look back because the more time you spend with them, the harder it will be to fight temptaion.|`|bxBCzoCoaa	im sorry but if u were so happy in your marriage, u wouldn't be fascinating about this guy. Not trying to be rude but thats just fact. good luck. :)
b1NMh5K2aa	Its perfectly fine as your over 16|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	That actually is not legal at all. Anyone over 18 with a minor is illegal. It will be considered rape if you two have sex.<br>  <br>  I would check with your state's guidelines.|`|dnmXybF5aa	there's no law to be together at any age. you're a pretty stupid 17 year old. the law can't regulate who can be together. but they can regulate who can have sex. its not illegal for anybody to be together...its not even illegal for you two to have sex.|`|HP4eFPHjaa	Yea that sounds OK to me because the fine girls normally if not always only date older guys.|`|Xvq1cFZKaa	nooo, but if your parents don't care then <br>  i'm guessing it's fine :)|`|Y6YaMR34aa	no its fine if u do have sex wear a condom|`|nDf8GpQSaa	Your turning 18 so it doesn't really matter because you will be legal.<br>  <br>  It all depends where you live and what you guys do but since your less then 3 years and are close to turning 18 it should be legal.<br>  <br>  ( Now if you where like 15 then it would be illegal because it would be less then 3 years and in most states/countries under the concent age which norms around 16-18 )|`|6JrCDCtuaa	there is no law against dating, it is just again sexual conduct, but as you said, if you didn't say anything about that it's perfectly fine.|`|4ju4FUhmaa	only if he takes advantage of you or leave you pregnant, but if you guys love eachother, then it shouldn't be any problem|`|rhTCejrtaa	Yes it's legal, no need to worry ^^|`|hSsTlC6Saa	legal.

He could be hurt. you should have done this ALONG time ago. before he is killed, lost, or anything else, CALL THE POLICE, I repeat. So please, if you love him do something.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	call the police, but first go to your sheriffs web site or police dept and see if he's in jail, and you can always wait for the credit card statements.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	call the police.. why won't your mom call them??? sounds strange to me that she won't!!!!!!!!!!|`|c0b3a3d1ca8d64e5dea7c223d45e5348aa	Let your Mom handle it,and pray for your Dad.|`|36R3v5VBaa	Call the police, he could be hurt.

xufESx85aa	You shouldn't be hitting and kicking each other. <br>  <br>  Don't worry so much about her being mad at you. Everyone gets mad. Just give her time to cool off, she'll eventually come around.|`|81SHaBnZaa	I agree with Rita. Me and my friends tease each other and stuff but we don't hit each other.|`|9ODIb3Hhaa	lol she stupid then.<br>  what kind of friendship is that.|`|69GgJhnWaa	Hey, here's an idea. How about friends don't beat the crap out of one another and find it amusing. I can guarantee that I never have stupid fights with my friends because I jokingly smacked them, because people tend to get angry when you hit them. Hmmm...people getting angry when they are hit. What a concept. Did you stop to think that at some point she did something to let you know the hitting wasn't funny anymore and you kept pushing, hence the cat fight? How about you apologize and agree not to touch each other in a violent manner again to avoid the problem.
E7RhMRKhaa	After the divorce I would recommend she qiut claim the deed.  She has to sign the quit claim, he cannot do it alone.|`|O3CPESX1aa	if her name in on the deed she will have to sign a quick claim deed and the person who keeps the house will either have to refinance the loan in their name only or  have the bank write up a letter stating  this person no longer has any interest in this loan. It's to protect your credit in-case they default. You do not want anyone who may default on your loan they can get you in a lot on  debit real fast.

AA11404499	I'm so happy you said nerdy instead of geeky. To me, a nerd is someone who is intelligent in at least one area, and enjoys learning, even strange things... AND has good hygiene (smells at least reasonable, and has clean hair/face/breath). Nice :)    For me, the guy would have to not be too exclusively math- or science-oriented, because I just wouldn't have much in common with him, since I'm the arts-and-language type. But I absolutely love smart guys who are a little bit awkward socially... it's adorable. and hot.    I'm especially weak for theater nerds and language nerds, but I'm a huge fan of most varieties and wish I could find more where I live.     I don't think I'm very typical, since a lot of girls' perception of a nerd is the Seth Cohen type from the O.C., they'll say they like nerds, and then they don't like actually having to speak intelligently.     Be nerdy, but be bold, so a girl knows you like her. She might just be a nerd-lover in the making :)|`|EwUcmfoFaa	I love nerds because I end up having a lot of common interests with them and they are fun to talk to and just interesting people. Cute too!|`|3vbci7O6aa	I love nerdy guys, but not until I was older and looking for a mate instead of just a good time. Bad boys will date and be lonely, nerdy guys will make happy little families. In the end the nerdy guy always wins.|`|O46xKklpaa	every girl has their own opinion on nerdy guys but i think they are adorable|`|WjqP1Mwqaa	i've seen my friends date them before. it depends on how much attraction means to you in a relationship|`|yavm9QpRaa	HAHAHA! My best friend is a complete and total nerd, and I'm deeply in love with him. I think geeky guys are pretty fun to hang around with. Plus it's an added bonus when they can help me with my homework! lol.|`|SbwlTIQqaa	of course preps won't be into them usually, but im considerred a prep/jock, but i have a lot of friends from every clique and sometimes nerds are fine, but only if they're nerdy to an extent. just learn how to treat a girl and it'll pay off.|`|iikNFWZkaa	We can't tell you what girls think of nerdy guys, but we can tell you that gay guys think nerdy guys are freakin HOT!|`|X2E6mvUPaa	Hahaha Best Question EVER. Well each girl has their own opinion but me and one of my friends ADORE them, as long as there smart and/or shy or cute we love them, maybe because we are spazzes :/ But whatever. We Admire them from Afar, not because we're ugly or anything, just out of shyness. I got a Nerdy Bf of my own :] My Friends had to ask him out for me but now im going out with him happily. Woops Off topic >.|`|IDsMXzIhaa	They're adorkable :D|`|3BGJETHYaa	Depends on the girl.  Some girls like them, some girls don't, most of the girls that like nerdy guys like them a lot more if they have good hygeine and take care of their health.|`|B4y9w6Braa	dwn2 earth. smart. cute. and definatly not players! the best kinda guys to date!!!!! |`|wrI3ITrKaa	i think they're cool and some of them are hott (:|`|hKbvlyBoaa	Nerds can be the best at times.|`|0JLGGShnaa	had a crush on one once, my friend LOVES them. think of Sylar in the Heroes epi where he was a father in the futre with big glasses and an apron. haha, we thought he was so cute AND sexy at the same time|`|hwEQH1tpaa	Well, from the outside looking in, some girls don't even give them a chance. Most go for jocks which at most times are jerks. I'm not a jock but not a nerd either. My girlfriend loves me for the way I am, not my looks, not my past. Just my personality. I think if girls judged more on personalities, the "relationship world" would be a little better. Or possibly even a lot.    There are girls out there that judge on personalities, so I didn't say that all girls judge on looks and athletic ability. But that is what girls judge on when it comes to first impression.|`|5R7N5dcYaa	they are awesome!|`|T1X3pRt6aa	I think they are attractive|`|ok1Y31wqaa	guys can be cute and nerdy...intelligence is nothing to be ashamed of :D|`|0ectWZxAaa	Intelligence is hot. And nerdy guys are intelligent. :]|`|XN71akL6aa	if a guy is smart and hot, then he`s really hot.    thats becuase you can make money for your wife in the future ?|`|Ethykzkoaa	I think that everyone is multifaceted when it comes to personalitys. Nobody is just a nerd, or just a jock, etc.  I love my fiancee because of who he is, so what he likes video games, he also loves football.  I'm sure a girl out there likes you for you, not for what you do that you consider "nerdy".|`|11vCHFVoaa	i like smart guys  as long as they dont make me feel stupid|`|0qtgH7lNaa	it generally depends on the dude. i love the "dorkier/nerdier" guys.  they're fun to hang out with and all that jazz. and of course, a lot of them are attractive. you can't really define someone as just a nerd or a dork or something. i try not to stereotype.|`|kDZjuKUaaa	yea! my boyfriend was/is one :D|`|BeooMcSPaa	Theres so many things it depends on!|`|xuwDmwVUaa	i think they cute. they r smart n they are futre millionares. i have alot of geeky friends n sumtimes i like hanging out with them better than my jock friends. i thinks its cute cuz they r nice n stuff|`|Oe5qcm8Haa	im in love with one.  they are hot!|`|lheBbzNFaa	I am a nerd proud to admit it. Some like us others despise us.|`|FSikubhqaa	Nerds=sexy smart, and freaking awesome. :D|`|SeNb5iFDaa	It depends;  computer geeks; i think they are smart, intelligent, patient, and usually a gentleman that appreciates women and their beauty :]    Goofy guys that cant dress; they obviously need to dress better and that's it generally they are sweet and cute :]|`|AWbRG02Gaa	SEXY(:|`|yyRzRNcyaa	Everyone has a different meaning of "nerdy". But here are the two most common ones:    If you're talking about nerds, as the one with absolutely no life, who spend the whole day on the computer, etc, then I would guess most girls do not like them. Unless of course, the girls are nerds themselves.    If you're talking about nerds, as in the ones who receive good grades, then I would presume girls actually like them. Again, it will depend on the girl, but this is just generally speaking. Nowadays, it seems like smart guys are also very athletic, charming, and attractive.     Hope that helps ;)|`|StHedcXtaa	hotties, i love a boy with brains|`|yDfbQOTjaa	well if you mean just someone quiet and smart that's cool. if you mean someone who sits in the house with their mom, thinks they're smarter than everyone and superior, wont make friends and wears terrible clothes that's just someone i wouldnt want to be around.|`|XIfqbeXMaa	they are ugly and gross!    &&WEIRD!!! That's why I am a Lesbian ;)|`|CQR11hKlaa	i think they are really hot because they can answer your questions except some are prude which is annoying but i like them because they are nice and not cocky like the footballers .. (:|`|mI4fGzfAaa	I prefer them, unless they spend way too many hours playing WoW or Halo.  To me, nerdy means well-read, intelligent, and fun. =P  I like to be able to talk to a guy who can carry on a serious conversation about politics and how the government is corruped, etc.  You can learn a lot from nerds! :]
faa694c6f97cb62a1a4c339d042e82a1aa	dipende, certe volte  meglio perdere e la fuga  un buon metodo.  Altre la fuga  dalle responsabilit perch uno magari  troppo giovane per il matrimonio.  Altre volte  vigliaccheria.  La fuga non  mai bella ma secondo me chi la mette in pratica non ci perde.  Casomai chi perde  chi insegue perch perde tempo, energie, soldi, fiducia in se stesso etc etc etc    quindi in amore non si fugge ne si insegue, si ama e basta|`|c6aab15469f9fb61bdf35e4072ceb4f9aa	...fuggire da chi?...da se stesso,direi che e meglio sapere come stanno le cose che vivere nel incertezza...anche se non sempre e quello che desideriamo.Chi vince?...nessuno..|`|c7d0464f0ca6a2a0fa9acd9eec95cfdaaa	Vince la possibilit che chi l'altra persona lo insegua dimostrandogli il suo amore...ma non  affatto detto che succeda|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	brava...anche secondo me.

Questa generalizzazione denota un certo livore da parte tua nei confronti dell'intero genere femminile. Impara a fare le dovute distinzioni: non so che donne hai auto la (S)fortuna di frequentare...di una cosa sono convinta per: che se tu fossi uno dei bellocci di cui parli non staresti qui a lamentarti.|`|c9199d05a146425b757376a30990cc6eaa	premetto che da donna sono d' accordo al 50% perch non bisogna fare dell' erba tutto un fascio.  ciao.credo che dipenda un Po dall' et delle donne della quale tu parli se ventenni o Pi su' con l et.  perch da giovani, e non dico tutte, si cerca il meglio, quello che magari fa anche invidia alle amiche  insomma il Pi poi, col passare degli anni credo, per lo meno parlo per me, si va alla ricerca della profondit.  molto spesso bisognerebbe capire qual'  l' apice di questo comportamento.nel senso che, a volte pur di avere un calore umano, un attimo dove sei tu al centro della situazione,che quell' uomo  li per te, x colmare ci che ti manca o ti  mancato e ci si affeziona facilmente, si pu rischiare questo, di avere rapporti con persone bellocci, ma non per sminuire gli altri ma bens perxh se questo  il modo di crearsi il proprio mondo dove non si sta male,  normale che si scelga il meglio perch se no sarebbero stupide.|`|742093826b1d278a8711c6e498f27a41aa	Ehi piccolino, ma con chi te la fai?

Comunque non credo che tu possa generalizzare in questo modo, anche perch ogni storia a s  diversa. Mi sembra che tu abbia un po' di rabbia forse anche un po' troppa. Ma non  penso che sia del tutto colpa delle donne, sai quando si  giovani, ed ingenue si fanno degli errori, ti parlo per me, quando mi  successo ero molto giovane ed ero innamorata, (e la bellezza qua' non c'entra niente) di certo non l'ho fatto n dopo una settimana che lo conoscevo, come dici tu, n per sesso, n per divertimento,  ma per AMORE, forse sar stata ingenua e lo so bene, ma purtroppo quando provi dei sentimenti reali per una persona non sei portata a dubitare delle sue parole e quindi capita che ti ritrovi in una situazione del genere. Anche se mi  successo questo non penso di essere una persona superficiale o altro, anzi, non rinnego ne' mi lamento, n voglio nascondere quello che ho fatto, anche perch io ho fatto tutto con il cuore, quindi non mi vergogno di nulla. Se ho posto una domanda simile l'altro giorno era solo per condividere un'esperienza con le altre donne, non era per nessun'altro motivo e non era nemmeno un'attacco al mondo maschile, come tu invece mi sembra stai facendo ora a quello femminile. Comunque, ti dico che ora che sono cresciuta, ovviamente, sono moooooolto ma mooolto pi cauta nelle questioni amorose, e non mi faccio pi prendere dall'istinto e dall'impulsivita' come allora.   Ti consiglio di non fare di tutta l'erba un fascio soprattutto se non conosci bene la storia e n la persona..... e abbi un po' pi di rispetto per la gente. passo e chiudo.

Contrariamente a quelle persone agiate, con famiglie molto affettuose alle spalle, servite di tutto punto e quindi viziate molto, secondo la mia esperienza, non danno molto affidamento nel riporre loro massima fiducia....!  Conseguenza di questo ragionamento  che, queste ultime, apparentemente, sembrano degne di fiducia, ma poi, da certi comportamenti, come dire un po' contorti e contraddittori (per esempio, illazioni ingiuste o calunnie) si scopre che non sono completamente degne di fiducia!..

5cd1931c2fa859de006393dd3fcd297baa	Non so esattamente cosa intendi per "carino serio e intelligente". Credo che sono tutte cose piu' o meno opinabili.  Non dico che sia il tuo caso, ma e' facile crearsi degli ideali utopistici e poi lamentarsi perche' non vengono soddisfatti.  E' ancora piu' sbagliato accontentarsi di una "mezza cartuccia" solo perche' e' il meno peggio sul "mercato".  Molto meglio e' cercare di capire cosa e' veramente fondamentale e pretenderlo accontentandosi per tutto il resto.  Ad esempio "serio" puo' essere inteso in tanti modi, certo significa il contrario di "una botta e via", ma che altro? Quali sono gli ideali di amore, passione, simpatia, umilta', fedelta', perdono, convivenza, matrimonio, figli...   Forse c'e' una difficolta' di comunicazione. Credo sia innata tra maschi e femmine e che la cultura attuale accentua questa difficolta' invece di attenuarla.  Inoltre e' incentivata la superficialita', la vita comoda, la mancanza di responsabilita'.  Non credo che gli uomini e le donne siano piu' intelligenti o piu' stupidi di una volta, certo e' che questa intelligenza e' "coltivata" in modo diverso. Per certi aspetti molto meglio (ad esempio il rispetto dei diritti umani, dei bambini, degli animali) per altri e' una desolazione totale.

Purtroppo a volte crediamo di aver trovato l'amicizia, invece  stato solo un abbaglio, perch, come  capitato a me, quello che credevo fosse un amico si  manifestato con il tempo un grande invidioso, della mia arte, del mio fare, della mia pazienza, della mia filosofia, della mia libert, non  facile trovare un vero amico, io sono fortunato poich ne ho tanti qui e sparsi per il mondo, non avr mai paura di soffrire, la sofferenza poi   d crescita.

Ma sono dell'idea che se una persona definita "amica" si comporta in maniera sleale...sicuramente amica non lo  mai stata...quindi meglio perderla che trovarla !    L' amicizia pu esserci e la si pu incontrare nel corso della propria esistenza,  rinnegarla solo perch si ha paura di soffrire in futuro, pu far solo che male...se trovi una persona che te la dimostra incondizionatamente....perch rifiutarla...sarebbe veramente un peccato, ti perderesti una delle cose pi belle che si possano avere.

Un sentimento che non vuole niente in cambio e molto pi resistente agli urti dell'amore perch dovrebbe essere pi disteso e senza particolari "doveri e obblighi"... Purtroppo a volte le brutte esperienze ci portano a smettere di crederci,  pi forte di noi. A furia di rimanere delusi diventa sempre pi difficile riuscire a fidarsi e prendere l'iniziativa. Tuttavia non bisogna mai smettere di essere aperti e sperare.   Per me  importante allo stesso livello dell'amore.|`|w0negYfsaa	E' importante, si dice che le persone che non vivono in solitudine campano pi a lungo. Gli amici servono sempre, anche al livello "affettivo" e per conforto morale.  L'amicizia  importante soprattutto quando con i VERI amici vi  amicizia e non ci si calpestino, vicendevolmente, i piedi e gli interessi personali. Il VERO amico  colui che ti fiancheggia favorevolmente nella tua vita, appoggiando ci che  veramente giusto e sapendo consigliarti e illustrarti cosa sia sbagliato da fare.    Il vero amico non tradisce mai la fiducia che c' con lui ed  sempre pronto ad aiutarti o a non creare contrasti.    Termina l'amicizia, invece, quando ci si rende conto di contrastare i propri amici e si tradisce l'amicizia per interessi personali, come per esempio una ragazza in ballo tra due contendenti-litiganti (e a volte c' un terzo misterioso che gode, lol).    L'amicizia  preziosa e spesso la gente, per invidia, tende a spezzare e dividere due buoni amici, i piu furbi sanno che nella societ, le persone, ci provano in tutte le maniere possibili ed evitano di farsi incastrare.|`|9rQcwjV9aa	"Finch sarai felice avrai molti amici; se i tempi si faranno bui, resterai solo."   Ovidio    E' un fatto constatato che l'amicizia ha un andamento crescente dalla fanciullezza all'adolescenza per stabilizzarsi nell'et fra i venti e trent'anni per poi iniziare gradualmente a calare per toccare il fondo dai cinquant'anni in s.Ecco, l'amicizia mai resta uguale,  pu migliorare , con il trascorrere degli anni, in qualit.

Tali funzioni vanno riferite innanzitutto alla nostra interiorit: il nostro nemico  la volont negativa, i desideri perversi.  LAngelo ci libera da questa schiavit dandoci i mezzi per liberarci: egli purifica la nostra coscienza (se glielo chiediamo) scaccia gli impulsi negativi e li sostituisce con sentimenti buoni e virtuosi.  Il Testo aggiunge che la persona realizzer senza sforzo qualunque tipo di lavoro (Marte rappresenta il lavoro, Venere rappresenta la facilit, la dolcezza).  LAngelo render facile lesteriorizzazione di queste Forze e la persona avr successo nella vita sociale, quando si occuper dellassistenza ai prigionieri o a persone che vivono in situazioni difficili.  Da questa persona, la Societ ricever tangibili attestazioni damore; ella sar apportatrice di concordia, di bellezza, di armonia e la bellezza, in particolare, sar per lindividuo solida garanzia di grazia e di successo, giacch IMAMIAH opera precipuamente sulle forme fisiche.  Lenergia dovuta a questo Angelo produce anche lamore per noi stessi; ne consegue che la stima di s determina una condotta esemplare, da cui discende la facolt di essere stimati dagli altri.  IMAMIAH accorda il piacere di ci che  primordiale, lanelito a quanto  divino; il desiderio di abbellire, indubbiamente, ma di abbellire il mondo invisibile, quello che non ci  dato di contempla  Essenza Angelica|`|CZfrk1iCaa	Il mio angelo si chiama Fabio,  un ragazzo che  morto,  il protagonista del libro La storia pi bella 1 e La storia pi bella  2, raccontata dal padre.

RhsIRvLcaa	Ad essere onesto ho sempre diffidato delle ragazze che dopo due volte che ci esci ti dicono che sei la persona giusta per loro. Magari si vogliono sentire dire che anche per te  cosi', solo, per dare libero sfogo al loro smisurato ego.             L' amore  sentimento che difficilmente si prova e con ancora piu' difficolt si puo' spegnere, percio' queste persone ( non  prerogativa solo delle donne) vogliono solo vedere in quanto tempo cadi ai loro piedi.  Diffida delle facili emozioni e delle facili parole, i sentimenti sono tutt 'altra cosa. Forse io sono la persona meno indicata a risponderti,  sono uno che sta parecchio sulle sue e che pesa molto le parole che dice, ma io preferisco gli introversi ai parlatori non pensanti.   Giocare con i sentimenti degli altri  una delle piu' grosse infamie che possiamo compiere. Le parole sono come  mille coriandoli colorati, ameni,  festosi.....un po' di vento e....  Ciao.|`|YMVfAURyaa	Ciao Arquero,  sai, io non credo dipenda da come uno parte... le considerazioni da fare sono sempre tante e non  detto che se una persona si dimostra subito pi sicura,  pi facile che poi ti illuda e deluda. A volte semplicemente si  sicuri di qualcosa, ma ci si sbaglia. Anche una persona che tentenna per mesi e ti lascia "in sospeso", non  detto che alla fine si riveli pi "affidabile", perch valuta la situazione in modo pi ponderato (con anche il rischio che, dovendo aspettare "mesi", uno nel frattempo si stufi...). A volte si crede in qualcosa "a pelle" e non si pensa di aver bisogno di ulteriori conferme e ci si butta. A volte invece si vuol pensare sulle cose un p pi a lungo. In entrambe i casi, ci si pu comunque sbagliare, non  colpa di nessuno: le cose non sempre sono quello che sembrano. Per questo, io credo che qualsiasi sia il tuo approccio alle relazioni, l'unica cosa veramente importante sia essere sempre "se stessi" ed essere sempre sinceri:  l'unico modo per evitare sorprese e ripensamenti. Certo, ti puoi comunque accorgere che la persona in questione non  adatta a te, ma con la consapevolezza di aver messo subito sul tavolo tutte le tue carte e non esserti mostrato per ci che non sei.|`|OHnqfkDWaa	Guarda io anche ero cos, le illusioni erano all'ordine del giorno poi ho detto basta...sai cosa? Non ti conosco, ma forse sei troppo buono con gli altri e poco con te stesso.  Dopo tante fregature, quasi automaticamente ho sviluppato un sesto senso che non  infallibile, ma quantomeno riesce a farmi capire certe sensazioni a pelle.... Lo ammetto, sono schiva, fin troppo...ho bisogno dei miei tempi per aprirmi...   Tuttavia, non nascondo che per alcune persone mi rimane pi semplice...non so perch, dipende dall'energia che mi trasmettono, s'instaura un feeling immediato, si accende una scintilla di fiducia...invece per altre, bh, come ho gi detto ho bisogno di pi tempo per assimilare la loro essenza, comprenderle, farmi un'idea (anche sbagliata) e ritrattare l'idea col tempo.  Ecco,  solo il tempo che riesce a farmi scoprire la verit nelle persone, nel bene e nel male.

Vivere consapevoli di avere queste caratteristiche e saper regolare le manifestazioni significa trovare il proprio equilibrio, ognuno ne ha uno dominato dalle proprie peculiarit e la variabilit dell'equilibrio  dovuta al predominio del "corpo" sul "cuore" o viceversa.

A qualsiasi livello , una contraddizione trascinata nel tempo, ti procura una scissione che , se sar piccola e parziale avr un peso marginale e magari insignificante nella tua vita.  Ma se l'incongruenza coinvolge dei principi fondamentali della tua etica e del tuo inconscio, produrr grosse contraddizioni e grandi scissioni.  Devi scindere la tua vita e fare finta di non vedere lo scempio che crei da una parte, per riuscire a godere di qualche cosa che hai messo nell'altra parte.  Fare delle scelte e precludersi delle strade non significa per forza vivere a met: l'incoerenza e l'errore stanno da un altra' parte se le scelte sanno essere giuste e calibrate.

In sostanza non dovrebbe cambiare niente ma in realt anche solo la calligrafia di una persona  importante e anch'io ho pensato ad una lacrima che bagna e fa sbavare l'inchiostro sulla pagina che via mail  impossibile naturalmente.  E poi il gesto simbolico di quando si aspettava una missiva importante, che si attendeva da parecchio, e appunto baciarla all'arrivo....insomma tutti quei gesti che nel "virtuale" non si possono compiere..  Non a caso mi permetto di raccontare un nostro (riferito alla mia dolce met e a me) piccolo segreto: noi teniamo una settimana a testa un nostro piccolo diario in cui ci scriviamo e ci raccontiamo pensieri, idee, progetti, ecc. ed  una cosa bellissima da fare proprio perch da quasi un senso e un significato "maggiore" alla nostra bella storia d'amore....s, insomma le mail ed internet sono utilissimi, ma a volte anche le cose un po' superate hanno sempre il loro fascino.  ciao!|`|d769d86f1dcc10dd11e7f86d0ac9626baa	Sei persona di grande sensibilit.

Dalla Sicilia mi spostai in Trentino, primo viaggio di un bambino che si sarebbe scoperto uomo tra quelle montagne.  Troppe cose stavano cambiando, e troppo velocemente. Molte non le capivo, come ad esempio, il cuore che incominci a percuotere la cassa toracica quando vidi lei, i suoi occhi, intorno ad un fuoco, l, in riva al lago di Molveno.  Non ricordo neppure come, ci ritrovammo a parlare, e quella notte, e tutte le altre notti a venire, durante quella vacanza, continuammo a parlare e parlare, senza mai smettere.  Scoprimmo d'avere la stessa identica et, d'esser nati lo stesso giorno.  Tornai a casa e la prima cosa che feci fu scriverle.  Le scrissi che l'amavo, e che mi dispiaceva non aver avuto il coraggio di dirglielo in faccia.  Lei mi rispose quasi immediatamente, e io risposi a lei.  Iniziavamo entrambi il liceo quell'anno.  Lei mi scrisse che odiava il suo prof. di latino, io le risposi che la chimica non era cos difficile come immaginavo.  Lei mi scrisse che s'era innamorata, io le risposi che certe cose della vita proprio non le capivo, di quell'amico che mi aveva tradito. Allora lei mi scrisse che suo pap stava male io le risposi che avevo preso la patente. Mi rispose che l'universit le occupava troppo tempo, che aveva cambiato casa, che s'era tagliata i capelli corti corti, dunque le scrissi che con Silvia era finita malamente, che finalmente iniziavo ad avere dei soldi miei, che forse di l a breve mi sarei comprato la macchina.  Ogni tanto, quando vado a trovare i miei, passando per l'androne del palazzo, rivedo quella cassetta e ricordo l'emozione nell'aprirla e scoprire che contenesse un pezzo della vita di Valeria. Ricordo le corse per le scale e via, subito in camera a sfamarmi di lei.  Oggi con Valeria ci mandiamo qualche mail, ma di baciare il monitor, come facevo con le sue lettere, proprio non riesco.|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	....Li conservo gelosamente in cantina, in una valigia rigida di  cuoio, tanti pacchetti di lettere, legati  accuratamente da nastrini .

La mia amica di infanzia si  trasferita lontano quando avevamo 14 anni, non ci siamo pi viste per tanti anni e da quel momento  iniziata una fitta corrispondenza che si  protratta fino all'avvento della posta elettronica. Ci scambiavamo almeno 4 lettere al mese e cartoline di auguri e delle vacanze. Ricordo la cura con cui sceglievo la carta, mi piaceva molto quella color avorio con i bordi irregolari, o la carta provenzale, leggerissima e quasi trasparente. Poi  iniziata l'epoca del mio primo amore che faceva il militare. Era bello aprire le lettere nell'intimit della mia camera e trovarvi dentro petali di rose e altre cose semplici e delicate.  E' finito tutto con la posta elettronica, all'inizio era molto intrigante e l'idea di poter ricevere e rispondere in tempi brevissimi mi riempiva di entusiasmo.  Solo che le lettere degli anni '80 e '90 sono ancora qui, hanno viaggiato con me in tutti i traslochi e sono una parte importante del mio passato.

Le lettere con tanto di foto, profumi e baci erano il nostro paradiso...e leggendo questa domanda mi  sgorgato immediatamente un largo sorriso al ricordo della busta grossa e piena di "labbra stampate" che trovavo nella cassetta. Era pi stretta e pi lunga del normale, viaggiava per via aerea e portava con se una gioia che durava tutto un mese...la toccavo per delle mezz'ore prima di decidermi ad aprirla. La toccavo e volavo...la aprivo e smettevo di essere in questa terra.  Assieme alle buste e alle pagine dentro, molto spesso, volavano anche regali dall'italia alla svezia e viceversa.

f163ab16b6a27f8a4e6f8a63eaa2c44faa	la storia a distanza si vive senza chiedere consigli in giro. Perch 200 teste potrebbero influenzare la testa che ha deciso di viverla a distanza.  Ognuno ha una testa differente e d un opinione diversa dall'altro.  Siccome sono domande sempre molto delicate, che implicano delle scelte ben precise, io personalmente mi estraneo dal condizionare e dico sempre "fai quello che ti senti".  E' un po' come chi va a Cuba e chiede consiglio se vale la pena sposarsi e portarsi la donna in Italia. Se te la senti, fallo.  Parlare di vantaggi e o svantaggi, su una storia a distanza, sarebbe come prevedere freddamente gli introiti economici, se uno dovesse aprire un attivit commerciale in centro.  La storia si vive e basta. Sia se a distanza che se da vicinissimo. Non ci sono vantaggi e non ci sono svantaggi.  Anche perch parlare di vantaggio, mi sembra un po' troppo da egoisti.  L'importante  volersi bene...e poi le distanze non contano, anzi si accorciano.|`|L1ODtqNpaa	Secondo me se si  distanti   e si  molto presi dall altra persona..  il vantaggio risiede sicuramente nel veder amplicarsi il desiderio dell'altro...  e quindi quando ci si vede  tutto molto pi ingigantito,sentito,desiderato appunto...  questo in ogni tipo di rapporto ,amicizia ,amore o altro...  la lontananza di una persona a cui si tiene  ci rende bramosi di poterla avere vicino il prima possibile....|`|MBDB8Ot2aa	no...ci sn solo svantaggi|`|xgZkTdkdaa	vantaggi?!?!    nessuno...|`|f5IFEtWKaa	Che ognuno pu coltivare i propri interessi senza troppe intereferenze dirette e immediate?  B, francamente l'unica storia che ho avuto "a distanza"  naufragata,ma forse perch ero troppo giovane e non reggevo lo stress di dover sempre parlare al telefono, in un'era in cui i cellulari ancora non esistevano,n tanto meno si possedevano computer e web cam.  In generale penso che un amore vada "nutrito" giornalmente e che la distanza,anche se non sempre, possa diventare un modo per "sovra stimare" il partner col richio che quando si potr stare insieme quotidianamente crolli un mito e si diventa all'improvviso incompatibili.  Pertanto,per quanto mi riguarda,i vantaggi di una storia a distanza sono pochi ma comunque ,per reggere un rapporto del genere, bisogna essere armati di grossa intelligenza e maturit.|`|WFRYToclaa	le corna..........ahahahaha|`|S6PlyLfGaa	beh  difficile da risp, io ho avuto una storia seria a distanza per qualche mese...ho trovato molti aspetti negativi, la lontananza, la mancanza...forse un aspetto positivo pu essere questo: resistere perch ci si ama e non rassegnarsi...tenere duro perch entrambi ci teniamo...|`|G2Py1HAPaa	il vantaggio maggiore  che quando ti rivedi sei eccitata  come se fosse il primo appuntamento e poi nn ti stanchi mai di lui, nn conosci i suoi difetti godi solo del suo lato positivo, lo svantaggio  che quando vi ritrovate e magari andate a vivere insieme, si spezza l'equilibrio precedente e la storia pu anche finire|`|1CDyOb2Raa	si litiga di meno e...............il desiderio di incontrarsi  sempre piu' grande|`|0L1hUpuvaa	b si ha ragione mascherina..... un altro  che puoi restare da lui a dormire x giorni senza i tuoi con una casa sempre a disposizione se ci si riesce!!!!|`|vWheE88saa	Fare quello che si vuole...tanto non si  controllati!|`|SuPeF77raa	i vantaggi di una storia a distanza non esistono, troppi buchi neri da colmare... conni pensieri non fanno bene all'amore.|`|CqrC3jdkaa	Non ce ne sono mia cara!|`|9W8Z3Vvjaa	Secondo me non ci sono|`|cp3EHDiLaa	ke puoi tradire senza farti scoprire.....tutto il resto sn solo svantaggi.....|`|vVcRoynraa	ci sono vantaggi in una storia a distanza?  sinceramente non ne vedo nemmeno uno,,,,    un bacione Dana|`|068d1d6eadec209dd3848858d5fc6f1eaa	nessuno purtroppo Conny....almeno io la vedo cosi'...spesso li vogliamo trovare per cercare delle giustificazioni...ma non c'e'...l'amore e' quotidianita'...  ciao  cio' che dice mascherina e' una illusione..non e' cosi'...ci sono passato per questo te lo dico  Conny non mettere il pollice,e' Natale:)))|`|u1UYcz5naa	il vantaggio  ch ci si rompe meno, lo svantaggio  ch ti manca nel momento del bisogno.  la realt  chi si pianta allegramente le corna!!! parlo per esperienza!!auguri di buon natale|`|KaRy4NTEaa	non credo, ci sono solo svantaggi, mancanza al di sopra di tutto|`|k7Z8eYibaa	se  una storia seria nessuno, se non  seria tonnellate...|`|06y57lVsaa	"vantaggio"...ke puoi mentire senza essere scoperto.  Svantaggio...ke non vi conoscerete mai veramente!!|`|Ty9Iigusaa	dipende la distanza...cmq io abito distante 40km dal mio ragazzo e ci sono tanti svantaggi..forse l'unico vantaggio ma molto limitato.. che sei meno soffocato, diciamo che all'inizio pu servire perch ne senti la mancanza e nel momento in cui ci si vede, c' sempre quella voglia in pi..quell'attesa impaziente...sei forse meno scontata! ma quando cominci a pensare a un futuro insieme e quindi capisci di starci bene, pi ami pi stargli lontano  difficile...|`|jZ7PwufWaa	pochi ma ce ne sono.. per esempio il riuscire a conservare meglio la propria indipendenza e i propri impegni..|`|tPcg3pq7aa	Tesoro...essendoci passata ti dico che non ce n'  nemmeno mezzo !    Ha ragione Leo....l' amore  quotidianit.....      Ciao Bella !    F.|`|R1VVQCIpaa	Si i vantaggi ci sono, ma come in ogni aspetto della natura umana siamo pi propensi a vedere ci che c' di negativo che di positivo!  Non sto affermando che non ci sono difficolt, soprattuto di tipo emotivo e sentimentale, la distanza pu veramente uccidere un rapporto, ma se c' amore e passione ci si pu imporre una disciplina mentale atta a far superare tutto questo!  Gli aspetti vantaggiosi quindi arrivano in seguito, e si fanno sentire, essi possono essere di vario tipo, come una maggiore affinit di coppia, un legame pi forte che fa superare le piccole come le grandi difficolt che si incontrano nella vita a due e tante altre legate al reciproco scambio di affettivit!

jMglu6iIaa	hmm well she could really like you but have a bad way of showing it. its something i used to do in high school aswell, i would like this guy so much but when i found out he liked me back i treated him different but not on purpose.. but to the point where it came off mean =/ i guess its a cover.. it could be she likes you alot but doesent want to show it or if affraid to show it so it comes off like shes has no interest anymore. maybe try writing her a letter or if you rather talk to her face to face and confront her about it. |`|yDfbQOTjaa	shes probably nervous and embarrassed of attention. avoid her a bit and she will come back around to you. dont keep bugging her or she'll feel scared and pressured. im sure she doesnt hate you|`|RL7SFeXJaa	girls like guys that are kinda hard to get..  so try to act like whatever with her then maybe she'll come to you. both bugg her or show her TOO much attention|`|SiUuicNKaa	well, some girls do that. they always try to avoid someone who have likeness on them. maybe she is only shy. try all your your best to make her talk to you|`|BAZ06Nnnaa	Unless I missed something here, I would say she is a bit confused.  You asked her to prom, which where I am is usually held some time from now.  So now you are just going up and joking with her.  You say you like her, have you asked her out on a date other than the prom thing?  Or are you going just as friends?  What gives?  If there are no other dates between now and prom (unless prom is in a week or two where you are) then basically it looks like you just secured a date for prom and might not like her as anything more than a friend.  Otherwise, I suggest you invite her to a movie or such somewhat soon, to show the girl you are a little more interested in dating her than just having her as a date for one event.|`|wF0k5YQcaa	She's confused. I can think of a few things it might be. It's obvious she was surprised or had no idea that you liked her, even her friends know that. So maybe her friends no why there's that sudden change in her behavior?  Not to be a downer, but it could be that she said yes because she was surprised...and she didn't really think it over so now she feels awkard around you.  It could also be because she LIKES you a LOT.  Girls are silly. the best way to get down to it is to ask her friends. if you don't get a believable answer, ask her.  If you were upfront about going to prom, just be casual and upfront about her new attitude towards you.    jeez, hope that works out.|`|5H8ockmgaa	Women are strange creatures my friend you have to be sensetive to their moods and desires. You are right to ask her how her day is, how she feels. Make sure you are sincere. Dont talk to people about her too much those are your private matters.     You certainly did the correct thing in giving her a flower. I think the best possible thing to do is just ask her if you can talk why not leave her a note in her locker or something like that or send her a message somehow. If you ask her if you have done anything. Then the key is and this is very important. LISTEN!! listen to her and make sure you dont make the mistakes again.    Dont give her too much attention you may get on her nerves. Just relax.    Good luck hope you sort this out!|`|Yc8mcp03aa	HAHA!!! She's embarrassed (like in a good way!). I'm assuming you're a teenager but teenaged girls get really uncomfortable around guys who have just asked them out. Don't worry about it, it's normal...    LOL

Senz'altro fanno pi male le parole !   Uno schiaffo si d o si riceve in un impeto di rabbia.   E' una reazione che sconcerta gli stessi interessati,(semprech non sia un'abitudine,e allora  un'altra cosa).  Il pianto di umiliazione per chi lo riceve,(generalmente il pi debole), il peggior castigo per chi ha compiuto il gesto.   Ma quanto  pi bella la riconciliazione!    Le parole, invece, anche se dettate dalla rabbia,rivelano il tuo pensiero.Inutile dire,in seguito, che non pensavi veramente a quello che avevi detto.  Non  vero! Le parole che pronunciamo con cattiveria, in quel momento le pensiamo veramente e non si dimenticano facilmente.|`|8cbb6cd0952d9ae222c2ac3266aac508aa	le parole io agli schiaffi reagisco e poi e finita l con le parole no|`|9ad057fc23c750d21d8add91786ffee6aa	Beh, direi che le parole offendono molto di pi!!

Che hano contribuito a fare del nostro paese un luogo di paura, violenza.. Di mafia! Hanno portato le persone a considerare grandi personaggi i peggiori mafiosi, indicandoli come uomini d'onore.. E a punire e denigrare le forze dell'ordine e i cittadini che sono contro tali crimini.. Insomma si sono invertiti i ruoli.. Chi ruba e spaccia  una bravissima persona, chi denuncia questi reati... E' un infame e merita di morire.. Insomma non ho parole!|`|aBcmgX35aa	il muro con mia madre. sono anni che ci provo ancora senza evidenti risultati. ma Dio mio quanto darei per buttarlo giu'!!!!|`|fbaf47ca378619758a2d53c5361d7db3aa	Il muro dell'ipocrisia...    Quando si usano bandiere e slogan all'occorenza...    Quando piuttosto che condannare un fatto lo si usa come pretesto per demolire tutto ci che va contro le proprie idee...    Quando si rivendicano diritti dimenticandosi dei doveri...    Quando si  giustifica ogni scelleratezza salvo ripensarci se queste ci toccano da vicino...  .......  .......    Ma anche Il muro del pregiudizio e dell'orgoglio che non permettono una valutazione obbiettiva ed onesta delle cose...    Il muro dell'indifferenza, il muro dell'ignoranza.....    Ma forse pensare di abbattere tutti queste barriere  un'utopia....Si pu abbattere l'utopia?

E' altamente offensivo.  Vergognati!!!|`|D6IypUvlaa	ma che stai a dire??  primo: le ragazze che tu definisci brutte come la fame lo sono per te e non per tutto il mondo...  secondo: perch si devono adattare?? non  possibile che siano davvero innamorate?  terzo: che disturbo mentale dovrebbero avere? solo perch vanno con un africano?? Forse sei tu che sei malato se  pensi che hanno disturbi mentali solo perch vanno con un africano!|`|5kHlKD7uaa	Assolutamente no. Qualche serio problema invece ce l'hanno quelli che nel 21 secolo pensano di appartenere alla razza ariana.|`|Sv03twrXaa	Secondo me hai da poco riascoltato  una vecchia canzone di Vasco  in cui lui soffriva perch la sua ragazza  lo aveva mollato per andare con un africano  (parole testuali)|`|cce41e064d1d97aa02c9e0380b357144aa	sei solo un poveraccio    la tua malattia mentale si chiama ignoranza|`|4d66e689139c1623db2f2ae6bdf0d0e1aa	ma stai scherzando? pure i razzisti ci mancavano|`|691175f94e56e6558c1125fe3f799a1caa	Ma stai fuori?

L'unico dubbio che mi resta  se il tuo essere razzista derivi da tue insicurezze dovute a fattori fisici o se invece tu ti senta perdente in partenza in un confronto (se pur ipotetico ed a distanza) con soggetti diversi da noi per colore della pelle e per tradizioni.  Un consiglio gratuito e spassionato: non buttare sugli altri le tue paure, analizza te stesso ed impara ad apprezzarti per quello che sei (per i pregi e per i difetti), senza esaltazioni immotivate e senza depressioni eccesive, un po' di umilt a volte non guasta sai?|`|c284b1e31f0dd6ca929684ed1d2a18d5aa	Ma che ca**o di domande deliranti vai facendo?

Sentiamo...|`|dc9006879eb515f3a552c4f6cd96275daa	ciao...forse tu hai un p di razzismo e non accetti che proprio la tua ragazza o qualcuna che ti interessava abbia preferito..un vero uomo di colore e non c'entra il colore della pelle...bisogna dimostrare di essere uomini anche se oggi giorno ce ne sono pochi in giro|`|tiYQSqKraa	mi sa che sei tu quello che soffre di qualche patologia mentale..|`|d71a8efda86a335ead3e245e1197c3afaa	non credo che accusare qualcuno di essere un mostro perch razzista sia tanto furbo. personalmente non appoggio tale differenziazione tra le varie razze (se si pu parlare di razze) ma neppure additterei un razzista facendomi il segno della croce. suvvia sono idee... se reagiamo con questo astio a tutti gli ignoranti del mondo finiamo per scotennare 3/4 della popolazione mondiale. La cosa riprovevole di questa domanda semmai,  l'alto contenuto offensivo che vi si legge: puro odio da sfogare in qualche modo ( stato solo il turno degli africani). K poi con africani cosa si intende?? E con razza? non ho capito...se ti trovi una ragazza del Congo non ti sta bene ma una dalla pelle di poco pi chiara proveniente dal brasile allora la implori di sposarti? non so, mi pare che la conduttrice di real tv non dispiaccia a tanti uomini...e mi pare anche una certa Naomi campbelle...o mi dici che ti fa proprio schifo? sei razzista sul serio o solo uno stupidone che non sa come sfogare la sua frustrazione? Anche il tuo modo di rispondere ai vari insulti  abbastanza sciocchino.... con l'approssimativa differenziazione tra le razze rischi di arrivare a distinguere tra 'quelli del tuo paese' e quelli della citt vicina...stai attento che se continui cos rischi di provare schifo pure per il sangue di tua sorella che ha quella spiacevole percentuale di geni non identici ai tuoi... eh sai k bello se non esistessero razze diverse, uomini diversi...se tutti fossimo finalmente identici a te...|`|2a61337edd8f45a403d5a2c9b6dfbf27aa	BRAVO CONCORDO CON TE RINCHIUDIAMOLE...|`|GTPMkxY9aa	concordo anch'io con pollo!   sei tu che hai seri disturbi, superficiale che non sei altro! le donne non vanno giudicate per la bellezza esteriore e gli uomini non vanno giudicati per il colore della loro pelle!  alcune persone sono in grado di fare una cosa che probabilmente tu non conoscerai mai: AMARE!  e vergognati a scrivere e anche solo pensare queste cose!

(per dipende se a lui piace come stile...)    Creare la situazione:    cenetta intima in cui lui per tutta la cena deve stare fermo al suo posto (se ci riesce) mentre te lo servi vestita (svestita) in quel modo...  il suo compleanno no?    classica camera da letto per lui sta legato al letto mentre tu fai un balletto sexy davanti e sopra di lui...    Salotto con candele lo fai mettere sul divano bendato, tu entri, lo stuzzichi un po' (lui non ti deve toccare), dopo gli togli la benda (non ti fai ancora toccare) lo fai ancora eccitare un po' a vederti vestita in quel modo e poi... V.M. 18     Mi raccomando che non sia una cosa triste in cui tu ti vesti in quel modo davanti a lui... se no perde tutto il fascino...    Spero possa esserti d'aiuto.    Buona festa :-)|`|7c9262c373ab44c41fc1ddcf2d69c266aa	Certamente un completo intimo  nero  o bianco , tipo vedo non vedo.

Beh dal momento che c' la mia donna sarei gi quasi ok, ma esageriamo.  Mi vengono in mente alcune situazioni arrapanti.  1) classica: suora vogliosa.  vestito lungo nero tagliato davanti e coperto da un bavaglino bianco con ampio spacco laterale, testa coperta dalla solita cuffia (si chiama cos). Fin qui niente di speciale, ma  qui che scatta la libido. Alzi il bavaglino e scopri i seni racchiusi in reggiseno di pizzo (colori scegli tu o rosso bordato di nero o nero bordato di rosso o bianco bordato di rosso o nero), alzando il vestito reggicalze (colori vedi sopra) calze bianche a rete giarrettiera, mutandine / tanga pizzo sempre degli stessi colori (coordinato va bene). Scoperto il tutto non ce n' non so se mi spiego.....  2) Donna in carriera.  l'intimo va bene il precedente, per la "copertura" elegantissimo tailleur grigio o blu con boa rosso attorno al collo  3) Panterona.  completo in pelle nera tipo tuta con pantaloni con vaste aperture seminate qua e l, dove serve per l'intimo confermo.  4) Porcellina  Tutina rosa con coda attorciliata, mutandoni di lana spessa a mezza gamba, guepiere allacciata sulla schiena, quella con le stecche di balena.    Mi ripeto, non importa molto l'abbigliamneto, tanto pi che, secondo me resister poco al suo posto.

Questo non per mancanza di intelligenza.Possono essere tanti i fattori; traumi personali, troppa sensibilit..  se ci pensi, tutti i piu' grandi artisti erano dei disadattati; la realt per la loro anima era troppo stretta, o troppo larga.

AA11118580	Exactly.  What is "IN" right now is to be exotic looking.  Or basically just non-white.  When have you ever seen a white girl on a video on BET if it wasn't a Justin Timberlake video.  Pretty much NEVER.  I think I saw a glimpse of one in a Pretty Ricky video - it was AMAZING.  When I go out with my friends who are mixed or non-white, suddenly I become INVISIBLE.  I personally don't think any ethnicity is better looking than any other.  And I think what is happening now is a backlash from the 80's when thin blondes with big breasts were "IN".  However, I think attractive white girls, though not as popular now as they were previously, will always be highly coveted.    In response to "why would there be white girls on BET" - the music videos played on BET are just hip hop music videos - not programs made for BET - know what I mean?  I wouldn't expect a white girl to appear on a BET program.  I guess I should have put it differently and said that there are no white girls in hip hop videos, period.|`|3768a6b120db7c11c7c2b90f25ba4442aa	I like pretty nice smart girls,and are you trying to say that blacks and latinas arent great or that whites are better?

urxI5APeaa	fino a pochi mesi fa ti avrei risposto "si, senza dubbio chi tradisce non ama." mentre ora la penso diversamente, per esperienze personali grazie alle quali conosco chi ama ma tradisce... ecco il mio pensiero, e mi scuso se non risulter chiarissimo, ma non  facile esprimere questi concetti: noi siamo Individui, e gi da questo termine emerge la nostra individualit, il nostro essere singoli, uno e non due... unirci a qualcuno, condividerci la propria vita  qualcosa di accessorio, e non di primario. siamo nati singoli, siamo fatti per stare bene da soli, il nostro "aggregarci"  dovuto alle emozioni che ne scaturiscono. In quanto individui, noi viviamo di emozioni, dipendiamo da esse. e credo sia naturale, e non da egoisti (come invece molti pensano) accogliere queste emozioni quando arrivano (e non cercarle, che  diverso). quindi, se un'emozione arriva, ed  una bella emozione, perch respingerla se sentiamo che ci pu arricchire? un'emozione pu farci conoscere un'altra realt, un altro amore, forse, un amore che respingendola non avremmo mai conosciuto. oppure pu darci sensazioni positive e, rimanendo in tema, farci capire che la nostra scelta  quella giusta. ovviamente se uno la vuole respingere pu farlo, l'importante credo sia fare ci che sentiamo di fare. e secondo me, soprattutto dopo parecchio tempo che si sta insieme, il sesso va in secondo piano e subentrano valori pi importanti e pi profondi, e credo che quello sia il vero amore. l'esigenza di un atto fisico nasce spontanea, soprattutto nell'uomo, e probabilmente aiuta a scaricare tensioni che altrimenti si ripercuoterebbero sulla coppia. con questo non dico di condividere il tradimento, ma non giudico chi lo fa, e non voglio dire "io?mai!!" perch potrei essere smentita dalla vita stessa.  meglio vivere di Emozioni che di rimpianti.|`|fx7xhqoIaa	NO EQUIVALE SOLO AD ESSERE UMANI ED IN QUANTO TALI SENSIBILI ALLE TENTAZIONI CARNALI...L'AMORE  TUTT'ALTRA COSA....

Non pretendiamo di fare un esercito di automi tutti uguali!  All'inizio, per la presenza di forte amore, tutti le diversit si annullano e i due amanti sembrano un solo corpo e un solo cervello, ma successivamente i caratteri si evidenziano diversi ed qualcuno potrebbe accorgersi di aver tradito se stesso.  Bisogna imparare ad aver fiducia dell'altro senza bisogno d'interrogarlo.

Qui almeno il contatto  diretto e non esistono estranei , ma fuori vi attende un triste spettacolo che si ripete da millenni. Del resto che ve ne frega delle persone che qui vi vogliono bene e che fino adesso vi hanno considerato persone di grande generosit d' animo ?  Forse io non sono adatto ad amare attraverso il formalismo ne tanto meno mi corrompo a soddisfare solo il mio ego, ma ti assicuro che in Anwsers troverai pi amore di quanto ti aspetti volatizzandoti nel nulla.

Un giorno, mentre guardava dalla finestra, Mooray si accorse che tutto era diventato di plastica... gli alberi, i fiori, le case... le stesse persone erano in PVC di tutti i colori...  Erano fermi sugli stessi discorsi di sempre...  gesticolavano come tutti i giorni...  e l'indifferenza dilagava cos tanto tutt'intorno, che a Mooray, le sembr di vedere arrivare un ciclone di plastica... Una specie di tzunami tutto colorato... ma fatto interamente di plastica... La prima reazione fu quella di chiudere la sua finestra e di andare in camera sua, dove tutto era ancora grazioso e i fiori nascevano sul suo pavimento...  Non voleva pi guardare...  non voleva pi pensare....  Anzi era convinta che non poteva dire e fare niente...  Ma Mooray non sapeva che aveva cos tanto Amore da dare.. cos tanta voglia di cambiare il Mondo... che non sent una vocina che si rivolgeva a lei...  Ed  per questo che ho risposto alla tua domanda, per avvisarti che ti stavano cercando, per dirti di riaprire quella finestra... perch ci sono persone NON di PVC che camminano e cantano e stanno aspettando proprio te e le tue idee, e le tue caratteristiche... e i tuoi stessi pensieri...  Ti aspetteranno con pazienza... non  mai facile arrivare... neppure partire... ci vuole tempo...  Ma anche la pigrizia pi grave si pu sconfiggere...  se troviamo un motivo per farlo...  Ti pare carissima amica?  Ti abbraccio Alba    Grazie Amica mia!  Alba|`|HI7nyA4Paa	Cara Moonray,  anzitutto complimenti per il tuo avatar, molto originale, non l'avevo visto prima e non ti avevo mai incontrata, ma dato che mi sei apparsa perch qualcuno dei miei contatti ti aveva messo la stellina, ti sto rispondendo per il motivo che ripeto sempre a chi ci saluta con amarezza e se ne vuole andare.....  Ti dico ci che penso io per tutti coloro i quali dicono che se ne vogliono andare : anche tu avrai i tuoi buoni motivi, forse non puoi o non vuoi pi perdere tempo, ma non pensare che ritirandoti da questo mondo di plastica hai risolto i tuoi problemi, che indubbiamente avrai e che dici che non vuoi mettere in piazza,  qui che sbagli, infatti la piazza di answers c' appunto per questo, consigliare anche chi ha problemi ed aiutarli a risolverli, sia pure a parole.....  Allora apriti alla piazza pubblicamente.....non esitare....dicci tutti i problemi che hai.....e ognuno di noi far di tutto per alleviarteli, ache con semplici consigli, che ti potranno servire a risolverli...hai capito?....fai una domanda di questo tipo :"mi potete dare i vostri consigli?"...e nei dettagli ci racconti tutto.....non limitarti a mandare e-mail solo ai tuoi contatti, perch pi saranno a risponderti, pi consigli avrai per decidere su quello che vuoi fare.....  Sono andato a vedere per curiosit il tuo profilo, per conoscerti meglio, ma  inaccessibile, non ci sono n domande n risposte....e questo, secondo me,  anche un errore che fanno in tanti e tu pure....in un gruppo come questo, dove deve essere preponderante il pluralismo e la collettivit, chiudersi a riccio  inopportuno e controproducente....io proprio non lo capisco....in un gioco (da considerare tale), come answers, fatto di domande e rsposte, le stesse devono essere visibili a tutti.....  Sperando di averti un p scrollata e ridata la fiducia ora sta a te decidere per il meglio....e per finire ti volevo dire di andare a vedere la mia ultima domanda dove avevo chiesto il parere sulla nuova foto reale mia che ho messo nell'avatar....pensa che una collega mi ha scritto che somiglio ad un pedofilo....io mi ero scoraggiato un p...ma guarda bene le altre risposte di lode che ho avuto....vedi anche tu potresti risollevarti, leggendo i buoni consigli e tralasciando quelli cattivi che inevitabilmente, persone immature, possono dare e ovviamente io non me ne vado n cambio la foto che ho messo....ok?.....se tu vuoi, dammi una tua risposta l, e se per caso mi avevvi gi letto, qua e la, cosa pensi caratterialmente di me?....  A presto, carissima e buona serata....ti aspetto!.....|`|940170e2750bbd2063ca50d1854f1f41aa	credo che qualcuno o qualcosa ti abbiamo ferito .

Indubbiamente una persona come te manchera' molto, le tue domande sono sempre un momento di riflessione intensa..... purtroppo non ho avuto tempo di rispondere alla bella domanda sul .."come ho vissuto il mio piccolo mondo..." anche perche' non sono riuscito a sentire tutta la canzone che non conoscevo....ma essa merita sicuramente piu' di una risposta, magari  (perlomeno a me) puo' far venire voglia di conoscerti, e, chiaccherare ed approfondire......discutere e cercare di far capire all'altro il tuo pensiero, per condividerlo o rivederlo, ma la comunicazione e' sempre aperta.....vissuta....presa e ripresa...uno scambio come con pochi.....e molto altro...e tu lo sai.........  Ma perche' ci vuoi lasciare? Perche' vuoi privare tanti del tuo pensiero?.......Come puo' una 'condottiera', rifinitrice di pensieri" , suggeritrice di riflessioni", "stimolatrice di molte persone pensanti", ....e....molto altro, autoeliminarsi, affermando che il mondo e' di plastica??? Come dire che il mondo e' inerte, senza sentimenti, tutto inattaccabile......perche'?  Posso capire che non ricevendo stimoli, alle volte ci si voglia ritirare.....io credo molto umilmente che non potresti perche' ogni profeta, non puo' abbandonare i suoi disepoli.....  Rifelettici e sappici dire....la tua decisione sara' sicuramente rispettata......ma......io, non sono completamente daccordo!! E non per egoismo.....penso che tu l'abbia capito.

In effetti  vero quello che dici, di sicuro molte hanno pi paura e siamo sicuramente meno portate, ma questo non vale per tutte e soprattutto vale anche per gli uomini.  Guarda che ho visto ragazzi che quando guidano bisogna mettersi le mani nei capelli!  Per quel che  da dire  da dire...quando guido mi incavolo soprattutto con le donne! Sono troppo imbranate certe!  Modestamente io mi tolgo fuori dal discorso....anche perch sono ogni giorno in auto e spesso per lavoro devo guidare anche i furgoni, quindi un p di pratica l'ho fatta!|`|396f8d5c2882d49c85accdadc3055ff6aa	ci sono anche uomini che sono negati e farebbero meglio a restarsene a casa|`|1114334115f3b31d77e7132b8d9f32beaa	Per fortuna ci sono gli uomini come te che ci illuminano!

Essere prudenti non significa non saper guidare anzi...non  un caso che le assicurazioni facciano degli sconti alle assicurate di sesso femminile...  a mio avviso guida meglio chi non mette a repentaglio la propria vita e quella altrui.  Quanto ai riflessi...non mi risulta sia una questione generalizzata, io ho i riflessi molto pi pronti sia del mio ragazzo che di tutti i miei amici...infatti loro tamponano almeno 3 volte l'anno, io in 13 anni di patente non ho mai tamponato nessuno, eppure le mie velocit medie non sono affatto trascurabili.    Ti posso dar ragione, sforzandom i di generalizzare, sulla prudenza...credo che l'istinto materno porti la donna a una maggiore autoconservazione.    quando ero ragazzina ero una vera scellerata, sia in macchina che in motocicletta, ma adesso che ho superato i 30 niente pi sorpassi azzardati e niente pi corse sfrenate in moto.     In ogni caso non sono affatto portata per fare da passeggera, anzi, preferisco mille volte guidare io perch arrivo 5 minuti dopo gli altri ma non rischio di ammazzarmi in un frontale n di ammazzare nessuno, e soprattutto non faccio vomitare i miei passeggeri con brusche curve.  Andare pi veloci non significa saper guidare meglio...e molti non l'hanno ancora capito.|`|e2dbbf4d8d68b09f345a6633bb23ee3daa	no comment..meglio che non dica niente..  ;o)|`|30e8ed58b3df390d2cad40e9b9899f01aa	ho paura che ti attirerai grosse critiche con questa domanda falsa e tendenzionsa... auguri!|`|007dfdc4f16ff7674a6fbe8c7b44634eaa	 una questione genetica...la donna non ha affinato come l'uomo la capacit di orientarsi nello spazio e nel calcolare le distanze, mentre ha ingigantito capacit intellettuali ed empatiche...con le dovute eccezzioni che confermano la regola !  le differenze comunque sono minime ! !  e la collega sopra di me ha colto nel segno : la loro difficolt in questo campo le rende molto pi prudenti di noi maschietti, di conseguenza causano percentualmente molti incidenti "piccoli" ma pocchissimi incidenti gravi ! ! !|`|2a9d415561c129213bdd66c822900265aa	Veramente ne conosco di bravissime, compresa mia moglie|`|a683a7efe319e8be3b87fa5d47116d4caa	senza rancore, ma io guido meglio di tanti uomini imbranati, e comunque una buona passione per le auto ci vuole!|`|0e7d95cb78763a3e41056376ec69275daa	questo  un tuo pregiudizio...a me sembra tu stia dicendo delle bischerate...uomini che guidano esattamente nello stesso modo in cui tu descrivi le donne al volante te ne trovo quanti ne vuoi...se poi le donne sono pi prudenti alla guida questo non  senzaltro un difetto.|`|2d60dda255459f2721c2822234652ce4aa	Perch non ci sono pi le carrozzelle.|`|c6765f83403837456b76f376acef0c23aa	Le assicurazioni non sono per nulla lecchine ma badano al so(l)do... e allora mi spieghi perch il premio che le donne pagano  pi basso?|`|ddd562ac4be585da24dc0b32c943edb7aa	Non  assolutamente vero,difendo a spada tratta il gentil sesso,con la speranza che qualcuna mi mandi un bacio per la buona azione che faccio difendendole.Sono convinto che guidano come noi|`|8d36e02cb0c522b52f19621c20f60d3caa	Questo lo dici perch non hai visto guidare me!!!! =) Mi chiamano Shumy|`|e702f14115733e7465743609e342cbfbaa	A me questo sembra un preconcetto e un po' una scemenza!

Se intendi che non vanno in giro a fare le tamarre sgommando in partenza, tagliando le rotatorie, e sfrecciando a tutta manetta nei centri abitati, allora siamo indubbiamente negate, per fortuna!  Se intendi che fanno statisticamente mooooooooolti meno incidenti degli uomini, i quali qualche volta sembrano avere l'obiettivo di raccogliere il maggior numero possibile di sinistri,  s, di nuovo siamo negate, hai ancora ragione.  Personalmente ho all'attivo circa 200.000 km di guida con zero incidenti e giusto un paio di grattatine sul paraurti, il minimo sindacale, dai! ;-)    Poi ammetto che ho un paio di amiche che al volante.... aiutooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!...|`|d3983571686b4396dfe8e0332f63465caa	sono negate nel senso che te la negano perche' non vogliono dartela mentre guidano, perche' sono piu' prudenti degli uomini!!!    e pagano anche meno di assicurazione...chissa perche'...|`|d05e23a8fe7f4cdfb6ca427fcbf8c393aa	e chi l'ha detto che le donne sono negate??solo un vecchio detto popolare....suvvia....poi  vero anche che ne trovi certuni per strada che pare de vede' matusalemme al volante!!|`|e09b3222ad4264944ea4751cf206fdd4aa	sai qual' la differenza tra un fulmine  una donna al volante??  nessuna tutti e due sono attratti dagli alberi....|`|8886dec1cfd887b0d689590aa2392906aa	Latino mi spiace controbattere quello che hai scritto..ma non sempre  cos io conosco donne compresa la sottoscritta che piace guidare un'autevottura a quattro ruote e si fa con grinta e tenacia senza avere paura..non soload alcune di noi rilassa pure farlo..solo su una cosa concordo con te noi donne siamo pi prudenti..e meno pronte a rischiare..forse sar perch abbiamo un sesto senso un p pi sviluppato di quello degli uomini che ci mette all'erta di non incappare in certe situazioni stradali senza uscita...

Pur con tutte le eccezioni del caso,  scientificamente provato che le donne hanno sviluppato meno quella parte del cervello che riguarda la capacit di orientarsi e di muoversi nello spazio, mentre ha maggiormente sviluppato la parte relativa alle capacit di relazionarsi e di esprimere le proprie emozioni. La causa  da ricercarsi nel fatto che, per il principio evoluzionistico, nel corso dei millenni si sono selezionati gli uomini che meglio sapevano sopravviere all'esterno della propria casa, andando a caccia e facendo al guerra (e questo  anche il motivo dei muscolimaggiormente sviluppati), mentre le donne per la loro capacit di mantenere le famiglia, risolvendone i problemi, relazionandosi in una societ strutturata.|`|ce570e829b3d700f90c4747d6d88af1eaa	perch siamo meno pratiche e pi emozionali, ma nn  sempre vero|`|683e5121af947c78f4a810ed8c6dc349aa	TUA SORELLA E' NEGATA ALLA GUIDA.

Pensa a come vuoi che sia caratterialmente.  Potrei consigliarti "Aicha" ... ha un suono fantastico. Comincia con la A, la prima lettera dell'alfabeto, e poi stacca di netto con un impeto di decisione sulla I, per sciogliersi in un suono dolce e rilassante come un mantra, sul suono "sc", per tornare nuovamente nella A, perch tutto finisce laddove comincia. E' molto femminile, misterioso e caldo come le terre d'Africa, e inoltre a nessuno verr mai la brutale idea di storpiare il nome con un diminutivo. E' un nome che a sentirlo pronunciare, fa solo piacere.

20aa3aeb8bf5329ab1fc8d8ea53fb997aa	fare sesso con una sconosciuta  accattivante come idea, ma sei sicuro che vi piacciono le stesse cose? che non gli viene in mente di fare qualcosa che non ti va? oppure che  solo un gesto meccanico? non so se ci proverei tanto gusto. poi mi sa molto di giochino tipo roulette russa...  un p di confidenza ci deve essere, senn meglio una pippa.|`|a22d1c4b50ce35853860414e4f694d53aa	mai fatto con uno sconosciuto...ti dir...non sono convinta che serva l'amore per fare del sesso...anche se in questo momento della mia vita non andrei col primo che passa....|`|80a29710257cfbe218bfc6acc34b4a66aa	Personalmente mai fatto.

L'ho fatto un paio di volte diciamo con uno conosciuto in serata perch mi piaceva ,lo trovavo affascinante etc. e mi andava di farlo.  Il sesso senza sentimento si pu fare, l' attrazione sessuale  una cosa e il sentimento l' atra.Certo che sempre meglio farlo anche con il sentimento, senza dubbio.|`|d9c5382e216f13c6cab7674995d84ad0aa	io personalmente non lo farei mai non  da me e credo che mi farebbe piu stare male che bene, ma non ci trovo niente di sbagliato se una persona fa questo tipo di scelta il sesso va vissuto come meglio si crede ..|`|fe09bc0105f0b212078c49f221bcf37faa	per me sarebbe una cosa impossibile sono una persona piuttosto restia anche nel mostrare i miei sentimenti e per conquistare la mia fiducia bisogna passare le dodici fatiche di Ercole (metaforicamente) figurati se riuscirei mai a fare sesso con una persona che neppure conosco|`|05729edfc6c7053de4e05ed8169f1db0aa	io nn ho mai fatto sesso con uno sconosciuto...cmq credo che nn sia uno sport bens deve essere il manifestare al proprio compagno tutto l'amore che si prova...|`|4b46bff3942958ec86c7f900c3b8b91faa	Non lo considero ne uno sport ne un passatempo.. credo debba esserci qualcosa ma questo qualcosa   non centra con i sentimenti.. se c'e' l'attrazione e la complicit puoi farlo anche dopo mezz'ora..    Si mi  capitato.. ma mai in discoteca (non ci vado). E' successo in un bosco..in un prato.. sulla spiaggia.. o banalmente a casa..    Domanda un po' retorica il "si puo' far sesso senza sentimento?".. pensi che le prostitute si innamorino di ogni cliente?|`|b53c0af4d66a94273a676387e54a4d38aa	Il sesso deve essere fatto con passione e senza fretta anche con un/a sconosciuto/a ed  stupendo. altri modi non mi interessano.  bye|`|796a85f8b051691f03bbd11ec3b85320aa	A me con uno sconosciuto mai...per ora!!! Io credo ke bisogna trovarsi nelle situazioni....E magari vedere anke il momento della ns vita in cui succede....MAI DIRE MAI....Beati a quelli ke invece lo dicono!!!! Vorrei avere le loro certezze!!! Se parli invece del sesso senza sentimento invece ti rispondo SI. Ma non per "Sport" o "Passatempo" come dici tu...Ma xk a volte scattano dei meccanismi di pelle, di profumi, di alkimie ke la razionalit non comprende....Ci si lascia andare al momento, all'atmosfera dell'attimo in corso...Poi, sta a noi non renderlo squallido! A me  capitato e, tranne ke con uno (ultimamente tra l'altro!!!), sono rimasta amica della xsona in causa. Sta a noi quindi far nascere un rapporto...di sesso o amore ke sia..sempre nel rispetto delle parti. Questo per  ci ke penso io. Altri avranno opinioni diverse..ma in fondo il mondo  bello xk vario...Un bacione!!!|`|9b4ddf4df642937475d07c10a22f91d1aa	mai fatto con uno sconosciuto, per mai dire mai!!infondo se una sera sei attratta da morire da uno perch no???basta con i falsi moralisti!!diciamoci le cose come stanno, IL SESSO PIACE A PRESCINDERE DALLA PERSONA CON CUI LO FAI! quindi se un giorno ti senti di volerlo fare con un perfetto sconosciuto io non ci vedo niente di male!!che non diventi un'abitudine altrimenti significherebbe l'esistenza di un  problema a relazionarsi con l'altro sesso! naturalmente c' piu gusto farlo con la persona che ami, senza dubbio, MA NON SIATE MORALISTI|`|f1d4dc7447914916bb09449bd5b516a0aa	mai fatto sesso con uno sconosciuto....ma credo che si possa fare sesso senza amare....io penso invece che bisogna fare sesso con sentimento... bello dare te stessa al tuo partner...|`|4c3929f99972688c7cbd78952226da00aa	In un periodo in cui ero deluso dall'amore e dai rapporti seri mi sono lanciato nelle avventure per un breve periodo.  Con grande sorpresa ho scoperto che era molto pi facile, se si poneva la cosa con onest, trovare chi voleva divertirsi una sera piuttosto che trovare la persona della vita.    In un mese ho fatto sesso con 5 donne. L'ultima non l'avevo mai nemmeno vista prima! Mi aveva chiamato dopo che una delle ragazze con cui ero stato precedentemente le aveva suggerito di farlo... (che potenza la pubblicit).    Ma dopo ci mi sono chiesto: Ma che st facendo? Cosa mi resta?  Nulla.  Solo qualche ora di appagamento sessuale.  Tutto sommato, visti i termini, potevo ottenerli anche da solo...  Considerando anche il fatto che stavo distruggendo il mio gusto nel sognare, che mi stavo arrendendo a quel modo di essere "normale" che ho sempre detestato, quasi accettando una vita che per altri pu andar bene se ci si accontenta, ho preso la decisione di interrompere la catena ed aspettare.    Aspettare la persona giusta. Una persona speciale.    E non  dovuto passare molto tempo...    Comunque la risposta : si, si pu fare sesso con una sconosciuta.     Ed il mio giudizio riguardo a chi lo fa non  sicuramente critico. Se non si hanno legami con altre persone non ci trovo niente di sbagliato .    E' giusto che ognuno viva il proprio eros come meglio crede.    Io ho altre aspirazioni per ;-)|`|e77bdf059d1887c26e89ea6aa1a1be53aa	Si l'ho fatto ma inutile dire che quando c' amore e affiatamento col proprio partner  tutta un'altra cosa!|`|418e865fd1cc3f83b3c7afc41eccf80aaa	non l'ho mai fatto con uno sconosciuto...ma credo che sia possibile fare sesso senza sentimento!!sport no, passatempo purtroppo si|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	Mai fatto...sob.

Ora per fortuna stanno traslocando e lasciano l'appartamento alla figlia maggiore... speriamo che il talis mater talis filia non sia vero!!!!|`|1wZMw0tZaa	Nei casi di fastidio personale, io adopero un sistema che ho chiamato: comportamento dello specchio.  Lo applico quando non posso, o non voglio, disconnettere da qualcuno o da qualche luogo.    Mi comporto come se fossi uno specchio, tu sei gentile, lo specchio  gentile; tu sei volgare, lo specchio diventa volgare,  tu sei maleducato, io sono pi maleducato di te.  E se per caso hai da ridire, ti mangio vivo, perch non  scritto da nessuna parte che se uno si comporta una schifezza, non possa farlo anch'io ( in quello specifico caso, e solo con quella determinata persona).    Un piccolo esempio: Vivevo in un enorme palazzo di Napoli.  Aveva due scale e alcuni degli antichi appartamenti spuntavano da due parti.  I signori, adoperavano la mia scala ( la scala secondaria) come scala di servizio e di 'comodo loro'.  Lasciavano i sacchetti della spazzatura fuori dalle porte.  Bene, prima lo feci presente, poi un bel mattino, presi la mia spazzatura. salii dall'altro lato e gliela distribuii, piano per piano. davanti alle porte.  Avevano preso la bella abitudine di scendere con i cani dalla scala di 'servizio', e di lasciare i bisognini vari sugli scalini. Prima lo feci presente, poi un bel mattino, raccolsi con una tavoletta una bella cac..a, e gliela spalmai sulle maniglie delle porte (lato padronale).    In tutti i casi sbraitarono, si indignarono, per da allora non ho visto pi n un sacchetto n una 'pesta' per le scale.    Il principio  sempre lo stesso: Non fare agli altri ci che non vuoi venga fatto a te.    PS: Disconnettere  un Diritto fondamentale dell'individuo.  Non siate 'buonisti', non siate 'superiori', non vi forzate di dimostrarvi pi 'democratici' e aperti del necessario.  Non vi sforzate di essere comprensivi.  I prevaricatori sono gentaglia e Voi avete tutto il diritto di tagliare i ponti con ogni uno di loro.  La vostra gentilezza, rafforza la loro cattiveria perch, vedervi superiori, li rende ancora pi agguerriti.|`|c7qr87Ksaa	mmm cara....ho avuto il tuo stesso problema...bisognerebbe imparare a gestirlo,anche perch non mi sembrerebbe giusto traslocare per lui! :) poi se ti trovi bene nella tua casa,e magari  tua e l'hai comprata con fatica,sacrifici e amore ed  piena di ricordi....traslocare per un vicino troppo invadente??? >:( grrrrrrrrr.....ti aggiusto io vicino! ;)|`|wWFhYucaaa	tenerlo alla larga e mandarlo a fan cul se insiste!|`|ZDhixeB9aa	gestire doghs da te poi che domanda e'...ahhahahaha...|`|DtaEyyJaaa	dipende per cosa.  cmq la miglior opzione  parlare chiaro.  se sar intelligente non andr nemmeno a discapito dell'amicizia o potenziale fra voi ;)|`|232c65efcdbffd8dd5d17fa4d3357b65aa	Ciao,  Innanzi tutto la violenza non  mai buona consigliera,anche se a volte una sganascione farebbe al caso,ma anche essere troppo " buonisti" non   da consigliarsi.

1wZMw0tZaa	Capita alle persone magre dalla pelle liscia e tesa.  Spalancando la mascella, si trascinano le palpebre verso il basso.  Alle persone grasse, invece, succede il contrario: spingendo il guancione, preme con forza verso l'alto la pelle delle occhiaie, per sortire lo stesso effetto.    Infine nel caso mio, sono miope, l'accostarsi eccessivo del volto della partner ne deforma le fattezze facendomela apparire, di volta in volta, mostruosa o ridicola.

Il mondo cambia e nulla pu arrestare il cambiamento. Ovviamente non associo al cambiamento negativit o regresso, tutt'altro ...  il corso della vita che lo esige .     ciao e ... complimenti per la domanda !|`|3iqvg42naa	Andiamo con ordine.    1) Quante volte mi  capitato, chiedendo alle persone la loro professione, di sentirmi rispondere : " faccio la mamma ... faccio il papa' ...." ?  MAI !!! N con tono da martire, n senza.    2) Ha senso ci ? Ovviamente no.    3) Chi decide LIBERAMENTE di fare il padre o la madre non sa gi che questa  una possibilit esistente in natura e, soprattutto, che la natura assegna a questo ruolo precise fatiche e responsabilit ?  Certo che lo sa. Per c' anche da dire che tali fatiche e responsabilit sono FUGATE da sempre pi persone. Io, pertanto, mi levo tanto di cappello di fronte a chi sceglie di assmersele, tali fatiche e responsabilit. Proprio perch IMMAGINO cosa comportino tali fatiche e responsabilit. Lo immagino facendone una stima cos preoccupante, che io scelgo (per ora) di NON assmermele.  Sono per d'accordo con te che coloro che se le assumono non devono poi lagnarsi col resto del mondo (tant' che, ripeto, non mi  mai capitato).    4) In questa provinciale Italia, un padre ed una madre trogloditi son pi stimabili di un single che lavora dalla mattina alla sera per trovare una cura contro il cancro ?  MA CERTO CHE NO !!! E penso di non averlo ancora conosciuto, un italiano COS troglodita da avere un'opinione simile !!    5) Come mai in questo popolo di sante madri coraggio e di pap fedelissimi, abbondano separazioni, divorzi, famiglie allargate o ristrette da morti di figli in preda ad alcool e droghe ?  MA QUANDO MAI ci siamo dati arie di sante madri coraggio e di pap fedelissimi ??? ANZI !! Per ci che riguarda noi maschietti, ci siamo sempre dati le arie opposte, cio di latin-lovers e di sciupafemmine !!! E i pi maschilisti di noi non fanno altro che additare il gentil sesso dicendo "le donne sono tutte pu****e".  (una canzone demenziale di un comico delle mie parti, parla di un padre che canta al figlio :   con le donne pensaci su : ?  ? son tutte zccole sappilo tu !      Ma fa eccezione tua moglie : quella lo  molto di pi !! ?)  Quindi...    6) E veniamo finalmente alla domanda nel titolo : le mamme ed i pap italiani sono molto diversi dalla Madonna e da S.Giuseppe ?  CACCHIO, se sono diversi !!!    Se una qualsiasi coppia di genitori italiani, perdesse di vista un figlio di 12 anni e lo ritrovasse in un tempio a parlare alla pari con dei maestri, mica reagirebbero cos pacatamente come i due sposi di Nazareth. Farebbero un casino della mad... (ehm, no... volevo dire...) uno scempio nel tempio, urlando come degli invasati:  "Brutto disgraziato ! Ti pare questo il modo ?? Noi l fuori a cercarti e tu qui dentro, a parlare di str**zate, con questi vecchi rinco****niti !!". E lo riempirebbero di mazzate sul posto.    E, se a 33 anni un giovane italiano decidesse di farsi ammazzare per una giusta causa, di sicuro i suoi genitori lo fermerebbero, dicendogli:  "Ma che ti salta in mente ? Sei pazzo ? Lascia perdere, che ti importa di redimere il mondo ?! Torna qui, che il nostro amico al Ministero ha parlato col suo capo e, se domani ti presenterai da loro (sbarbato e ben vestito), di sicuro ti troveranno un lavoro decente. E cancella dal curriculum che ti piace leggere saggi filosofici !! Scrivi piuttosto che hai sempre dato una mano nella falegnameria di tuo padre !! Poi ti trovi una brava moglie e cos metti su famiglia, come fa OGNI BRAVO CRISTIANO" (!!)  .
68pl1oNRaa	si  vero solo che a volte accadono delle cose che ti fanno restare di stucco. Ti fanno pensare. Avevo una amica in chat mi  scomparsa all'improvviso dalla sera alla mattina e non mi risponde pi. Al telefono mi saluta e va via senza spiegazioni. A  volte resto li a pensare cosa avr fatto? Eppure non mi viene in mente niente. Davide questo  un aspetto negativo dell'amicizia quando una persona che reputavi amica amica che contattavi tutti i giorni non ti risponde pi e non ti spiega cosa  successo. Allora pensi ... esiste veramente questo sentimento. Poi parli con altre persone le reputi amici e ricominci a sperare, a ricredere nel sentimento amicizia.|`|DD9BRQGXaa	L'amicizia  una cosa grandiosa...e solo chi la prova veramente pu capire a cosa ci riferiamo...anch'io ho appena ritrovato il mio migliore amico dopo 9 mesi... bellissimo,fantastico....l'amicizia  personificata...qll vera c' in poche persone...sono qll che nn puoi permetterti di perdere...    al mio migliore amico...ti voglio bene marco...la tua amicizia  indispensabile....|`|0Se1dUtKaa	Gi, forse proprio grazie allamicizia ed al rispetto reciproco.

Ci accorgiamo dei nostri errori solo dopo che non vi possiamo pi porre rimedio.     Ma non preoccuparti, baster che il suo ricordo non svanisca mai dai tuoi pensieri, e sar come se vi foste riappacificate quando era in vita.    Io sono stato in disaccordo con mio padre sia quando era in vita che dopo che  morto, ripensando a certe sue scelte, ma quando vado a trovarlo al cimitero e penso a lui mi sento bene con me stesso e penso che cmq tutti e due, nonostante i nostri litigi, ci volevamo bene e lo sapevamo entrambi.    Tua madre sicuramente sapeva che gli volevi bene, e nonostante tutto anche lei sicuramente te ne ha voluto, stanne certa.    Quindi ti consiglio di non consumarti in un pensiero inutile, perch serve solo a farti soffrire e ad offuscare i bei momenti che ci sono sicuramente stati fra te e tua madre nelle vostre vite.|`|290db77bd7a40016186771b202eb3176aa	IO HO PERSO 8 ANNI FA MIO PADRE, AVEVO SOLO 14 ANNI E VIVEVA LONTANO DA NOI PERCHE' I MIEI ERANO SEPARATI.....GIOVEDI' 3 MIEI AMICI HANNO FATTO UN INCIDENTE E UNO E' MORTO.....

Io sono stata nella tua stessa situazione ma con mio padre... Siamo arrivati a picchiarci a sangue... Ma quando si  ammalato non ho potuto fare niente ho messo da parte l'orgoglio, l'astio, il rancore e l'ho assistito amorevolmente come avrebbe fatto chiunque avesse avuto un po' di cuore... Ho avuto rimpianti,  vero, per non essere mai riuscita a vedere la giusta via di mezzo per affievolire un po' la nostra conflittualit... Per in fondo non ci potevo fare molto: io avevo i miei problemi e lui i suoi, entrambi avevamo lo stesso forte carattere per cui nessuno dei due avrebbe mai fatto il primo passo verso la riconciliazione. Certo mi sono resa conto di aver esagerato, ma in fondo non potevo darmi tutti i torti... io spero che per te sia lo stesso, cio che nel conflitto ci fosse una minima motivazione e non fosse solo un capriccio. In questo caso, ti dico che hai bisogno di tempo per elaborare il lutto, come serve a chiunque!! E pian piano vedrai le cose con pi calma, con pi obbiettivit e riuscirai a ridurre i tuoi sensi di colpa... Spero anche che tu abbia fatto in tempo a dirle prima che ti lasciasse che l'amavi nonostante il vostro conflitto... In questo caso pu essere una piccola consolazione: pensa che sei riuscita a fare in qualche modo un passo indietro e comincia a sentirti meno in colpa... Ma se anche non sei riuscita a farlo, non ti crucciare troppo: tua madre sapeva comunque che l'amavi e la amerai per sempre!  Avrai avuto le tue motivazioni, buone o pretestuose che fossero, per portare avanti un conflitto con lei, ma certamente non sono state frutto di cattiveria. Abbi piet di te stessa, prega per l'anima di tua madre e se non riesci proprio a trovare un po' di serenit non vergognarti di chiedere aiuto al tuo medico: potresti avere bisogno di uno psicologo! Un bacio!|`|940170e2750bbd2063ca50d1854f1f41aa	ti comprendo , anche io ho perso pap da poco .

Il dolore della perdita non credo si possa superare, ma si pu imparare a conviverci affrontando se stessi e le proprie paure...Puoi aiutarti parlandone con chi ti  accanto, ma anche alla tua stessa mamma sotto forma di coscienza...Sapere che non puoi ingannarla ti servir a chiarire cose sulle quali ti senti confusa pur sapendo che, in fondo, conosci gi la risposta giusta sul da farsi. Infine, nei momenti pi difficili, pensa che proprio quello che stai passando ti aiuter ad essere una mamma migliore perch saprai evitare o risolvere (prima delle altre mamme) situazioni conflittuali che sottraggono tempo alle dimostrazioni d'amore tra madre e figlia.|`|534abbfefb1d8dda122ab8fa820db2f8aa	Mi dispiace ma sapi che lei lo sapeva che lo amavi tanto nn torturarti piu.................

Nessuno ci insegna a perdere, a cadere.  Vale qualcosa solo chi vince, chi possiede, chi si pu permettere, chi  firmato e chi ottiene, al di l dei modi, ci che vuole.    E cos si mente a se stessi ed agli altri: nessun impegno importante, si sa gi come andr a finire: male. Cos si evita di "salire" troppo in alto e, cadendo, farsi troppo male.    E,' questo, vantaggioso per far soldi: se non si hanno problemi di cuore si diventa pi duri, pi efficaci, pi liberi dai "pensieri" inutili.

04848217beeabc7944806e1490766e59aa	Hi Franklin, I'm raising my hand to your question on who would be interested in an old fashioned man who treats women right.Very few left that are like this.. I live in California and even though it's considered life in the fast lane - I'm still in the slow (sometimes middle) lane checking stuff out.  The living arrangement your wife(?)/girlfriend(?) has come up with is very creative and would work if both parties are receptive and agree to respect any rules made. I'm aware of a few couples that continue to live as 'roommates' after a break-up. I would call it a 'roommate with benefits'. With todays high cost of living, I don't see a problem with this arrangement. I heard it get's pretty rough because you shouldn't bring a date home   Best wishes to all of you.|`|AA10888522	U can be there for the kids without be physically living there , it would not look proper for you both to be leading separate lives with the kids in full view .Move out and start living but be sure to be there for the kids|`|6fab959502d2591cc6cf18b6a0df55f9aa	go with your heart...she is a user....move on and find someone who deserves you and that will love you...good luck
zgWReYjoaa	Davvero bella questa domanda!   Posso risponderti secondo la mia esperienza personale,  una domanda molto soggettiva.  Amare con la testa, secondo me non vuol dire amare. Potr essere un grande affetto, un amore platonico, ma non amore. La parola amore per me non pu avere nulla di razionale, di logico.  L' amore  follia,  istinto, il lasciarsi travolgere da un turbine di emozioni, una valanga di passione che ti porta hai confini di ci che  la realt. Diceva una canzone: "Solo i pazzi sanno amare" ed  proprio cos. " Il cuore ha le sue ragioni che la ragione non conosce". In amore si perdona l'imperdonabile, non esiste ci che  giusto e ci che  sbagliato, si ama e basta.  Alla mente lasciamo tutto ci che  razionale, la matematica: 2+2 fa 4, ma in amore pu fare anche 3. In amore  giusto anche l'impossibile.|`|4fef59d112de782fe217cbf6587ca618aa	Si dovrebbe AMARE e basta !  quando si ama non ci sono regole ma sicuramente  la testa che parte per prima perch la persona prima la conosci e poi la ami, non puoi amare una persona che non conosci. L'impeto del cuore? Se c' vero amore  giusto cos.........  Amiamoci di pi, che fa molto bene a tutti !|`|0CGXNIeGaa	Si ama solo con il cuore|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	Ancora una bellissima tua domanda...come resistere?   Sono tentata  rispondere :  con l'impetuosit del cuore ,perch mi piace l'impetuosit , mi fa pensare all'inverno di Vivaldi , irruenza, passionalit , slancio e abbandono ; ma in questi ultimi tempi ho capito che ci sono diverse forme di amore, diverse situazioni e soprattutto che ogni persona  diversa, ogni persona che si ama, per cui ...almeno io... amo diversamente. Ogni amore  esclusivo.  Non so....non so proprio decidermi....  Credo che ci vogliano entrambe , nessuna parte deve prevalere ,perch soffocherebbe l'altra e senza l'altra... l'amore morirebbe.      un ciao....aehm...in compagnia di  "une blonde"...vediamo se indovini...;-)    ....you got it :  birra !|`|c9ecc36c6d75732df1ec117bdbd14a09aa	Io penso che sia meglio amare con l' anima la testa si pu " perdere " il cuore un giorno  smetter di battere mentre l' anima vivr per sempre|`|6867a4ec2030c92adc6432a645adaeebaa	amare non va d'accordo con testa;  un controsenso.  l'amore, per me,  solo quello del cuore.|`|AC12hsbhaa	con la testa prepari la via x il cuore.|`|OCKKcHqNaa	Come ben sai, quando ci si innamora di una persona, si ama soprattutto con in cuore. Ogni volta che si "entra in contatto" con lei, si avverte quel battito accelerato e ci si sente un tantino inebetiti.  Sono bellissime sensazioni che per, come si sa, non durano in eterno.  Dopo questo periodo di forte innamoramento,  inevitabile che si passi ad una fase di minor impeto e, in questi casi, spesso entra in scena la testa.  Se prima molte cose venivano dettate dall'impeto del cuore, poi si arriva ad un qualcosa di maggiormente razionale.  A volte capita anche che il partner si trovi ancora nella fase "cuore" e noi nella fase "testa" e possono nascere i primi problemi della serie "NON MI AMI PIU' COME UNA VOLTA" e sono dolori.... ricordo una farse che diceva (purtroppo non ricordo chi la disse)...SPESSO IL CUORE VIENE MESSO NEL SACCO DALL'INTELLETTO.   E' inevitabile....non si pu vivere sempre in quell'oblio sopra descritto.   La cosa migliore, a mio parere,  restare legati con il cuore, ma non dimenticarsi mai di usare la testa. E' un binomio indissolubile.  Forse non mi sono spiegato bene, ma non  un argomento facile. Ciao a tutti.|`|0c3fcdac881cca034424c4bbaf3bf67daa	amare con la testa  una cosa molto bella....apprezzare le persone.    l'amicizia e l'amore sn per tutt'altra cosa....l'amore ti riempie, t travolge, anima la vita in modo stupendo.... una cs completamente diversa|`|81c5bc3d962e56e7faacccd8e8073022aa	meglio amare con gli organi genitali|`|68adaabd36cb308b4557b926db85b900aa	Sarebbe il masimo trovare il giusto connubio...ma il cuore in amore vince sempre.|`|01a703d1ed8fbad2ebc681927bc31cb0aa	Sarebbe meglio farlo con la testa, ma per quanto mi riguarda non ci sono mai riuscita.

Quelle sottospecie di cose (xk non sono uomini e nemmeno animali, xk gli animali non sono razzisti fra di loro), che alimentano l'odio  la violenza razzista, sono solo degli stupidi che si sono rifugiati nell'eta' della pietra!!!|`|Usr8yhRZaa	Razzismo in tutti i sensi: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...|`|796a85f8b051691f03bbd11ec3b85320aa	Cara, ogni giorno vedo e leggo cose da pazzi! Io vivo in una citt come Bari dove da anni ci sono sbarki di clandestini. Saprai tutto questo dai fatti di cronaca. Quello del '98 fu enorme! Eppure non li condanniamo, credimi! Non voglio difendere la mia citt, ma quando queste persone lavorano, non bisognerebbe condannarle e il 70% dei baresi non lo fa!! Anke noi italiani siamo stati ospiti nelle altre nazioni. Ma lavorando ci siamo conquistati la fiducia. Ma prima ci hanno dato modo di farci conoscere. Qui in Italia noto ke si  razzisti ancora tra nord e sud...come possiamo sperare di non esserlo anke con gli stranieri? Dea, io credo ke il razzismo non avr mai fine! Ed  una vergogna...Non si pu pensare di andare contro un popolo solo perk 2 esponenti sono impazzite e hanno ucciso una povera ragazza! Quanti delitti vengono compiuti da noi italiani? E allora? No, la delinquenza, come la maleducazione del vivere, non conosce confini! Ma noi siamo troppo cechi per accorgecene! Ti abbraccio cara!! SMACK!    Firmato: Aishal68zz (e non il mio clone Ashiali68)|`|3EgAKL0Taa	Concordo in pieno su tutto.   Penso che il razzismo derivi dall'ignoranza.|`|CaZkKJnRaa	NOOOOOOOO AL RAZZISMO!!!  Sono d'accordo con te al 100 per mille....ma purtroppo qui su answer ho letto anche di peggio....mi sono fatta il sangue amaro per un sacco di tempo cercando di fare ragionare queste persone ma non c' proprio verso....allora ho smesso di entrare nella categoria "politica" cos diminuisce il rischio di leggere cattiverie di questo tipo.... allucinante, sembra che la gene sia impazzita...di persone cattive ce ne sono a migliaia....sia italiane che non....ma la colpa si cerca sempre di gettarla lontano da noi,  questa la realt!!  Grazie ti meriti una bella stellina alla domanda!|`|xjyCvY7Qaa	Il razzismo  un sentimento che non esiste in s per stesso.  Non ha nemmeno una sua propria dignit di concetto.    E' una delle forme della STUPIDITA'.  Dell'Ignoranza. Della Paura.   Della Meschinit dell'animo.     Un bacio.|`|7K3ogiILaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOO AL RAZZISMOOOOOO!!!|`|3QtUgNoTaa	allora mi sono proprio stufato!!! stufato di qualli che fanno di tutta l'erba un fascio e questo vale  per coloro che considerano tutti gli immigrati dei criminali ma anche per coloro che tacciano di razzismo chi chiede il rispetto delle leggi, della legalit e dei costumi del nostro paese!!! la contrapposizione cos come tu la poni corrisponde alla contrapposizione di coloro che scrivono le odiose frasi che tu citi, il risultato  la radicalizzazione delle posizioni. Se , come appare, sei veramente convinta che si debba trovare col dialogo una strada di integrazione comprendendo anche persone che hanno preso la strada del crimine allo stesso modo devi comportarti cercando il dialogo con i tuoi concittadini che scrivono quelle frasi, sbaglieranno pure ma non meritano minor sforzo di comprensione di quanto non ne richiedi verso gli immigrati... un 'ultima nota, io ho moltissimi amicie  amiche dell'est europa, gente splendida ma ci non toglie che chi si mette al di fuori della legge ( clandestini o  criminali ) non ha nessuna giustificazione... Ti rispondo: esattamente come st facendo io, ti rispondo con cortesia e  fermezza anche se tu dovessi insultarmi, la forza delle idee giuste, la forza delle persone libere e oneste st nella capacit di sostenere gli attacchi a viso aperto.|`|GS2WcCqFaa	urlo insieme a te NO AL RAZZISMO!!!! Unico appunto che faccio  che spesso sono gli extracomunitari a compiere reati perch non gli vengono offerte altre opportunit e quindi le persone malvagie in quel momento vengono fuori.....Bacio dea

In conclusione, dato che il confine tra doverli criticare o volerli un p compatire  cos sottile, preferisco rimettermi a uno dei precetti fondamentali di Cristo: NON GIUDICARE.  ;-)    P.S.

Non  paura di crescere,  che ogniuno di noi eviterebbe i problemi molto volentieri, ma penso che  pi il pensiero delle cose a preoccuparci, che la cosa in se.  Se penso: se mi capitasse questa cosa che farei? sicuramente non ce la farei... ecc...  Ma se poi ti capita davvero, mentre ti ci trovi, ti rimbocchi le maniche e risolvi il problema. X certe cose ci vuole pi tempo, x altre meno, ma l'uomo  fatto cos, si chiama istinto di sopravvivenza e ricorda che sono sempre le cose negative, le classiche "batoste" che ci fanno maturare e crescere.  Le cose belle ci addolciscono e ci arricchiscono di ricordi che ci fanno sorridere e essere positivi x ogni cosa della vita, ma quelle difficili temprano il nostro carattere.  Una volta ho sentito dire che il pensiero della paura di una cosa, accresce la paura verso la cosa stessa, non  spiegato molto bene forse, ma con il tempo, le esperienze, le cose belle e le batoste, ho capito che  davvero cos, xci il mio motto : mai fasciarsi la testa prima di romperla. Non penso mai a: se poi succede questo che far? Sempre bene essere previdenti, ma la soluzione migliore la trovi quando il problema lo stai vivendo, in base alla situazione in cui sei e alle risorse che hai in quel momento, perci... Fino ad allora, buona vita.|`|f4aad3071c235e75d97a6bfa0f60c5deaa	secondo ma si puo benissimo avere paura dei propri doveri e delle proprie responsabilit quando si cresce.questo  dovuto dal fatto che non si sa mai cosa ti succeder,e questo ti comporta paura,perch comunque  il desiderio dell'uomo,da sempre,sapere cosa riserva il futuro,e sopraturro nell'uomo moderno,che ormai pu fare qualunque cosa,e sa qualunque cosa,il fatto di non sapere cosa gli riserva il futuro,gli mette ancora pi inquetudine di quanto non la mettesse agli uomini del passato.questo  fatto  dimostrato dal fatto che anche al giorno d'oggi,nel 2007,con tutta la tecnologia che c',tutte le persone del mondo ascoltano,o leggono l'oroscopo,ed una grandissima percentuale di queste persone,va dai "maghi",o dagli "indovini" per farsi leggere la mano,o le carte,comunque sempre per sapere che cosa riserver loro l futuro!!!!!!!!!!!!!in conclusione,s si pu avere paura,anzi si ha paura dei doveri e delle responsabilit della crescita!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!sper... di averti risposto in modo esaurente!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!tvb baci tua piccolaketie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|80a29710257cfbe218bfc6acc34b4a66aa	Tutti hanno paura delle responsabilit che la vita ti 'butta' addosso.... ma crescere e maturare significa prendere il coraggio e affrontare qst sfide una per volta.

L'amore  passione,  irrazionalit,  energia allo stato puro che si scatena in un turbinio di sensazioni incredibili ogni qual volta le condividi con la persona amata.    La vita spesso assopisce queste sensazioni e gli esseri umani si lasciano sopraffare e cominciano a commettere il peggiore errore che possano mai fare: DARE PER SCONTATO!    Ecco cosa uccide l'amore:  -  il dare per scontato che la persona amata vi ama (e quindi non dimostraglielo pi a dovere...)   - dare per scontato che rimarr sempre al vostro fianco ( e quindi non far nulla per liberala da questo vincolo e farla sentire libera di volare...)  - dare per scontato che... tutto  dovuto e niente deve essere guadagnato attimo dopo attimo!    Ecco cosa uccide l'amore, la nostra incapacit di amare nonostante ci reputiamo tali di farlo!    Rifletti amica mia... rifletti perch ser il tuo fosse stato vero amore, non avresti mai dato per scontato che fosse eterno e avresti fatto di tutto per continuare a farlo vivere!    L'amore (cos come la vera amicizia...)  come un fiore nel deserto che ha costante visogno di acqua per vivere sempre rigoglioso e a dispetto di tutto e tutti.

Ciao !|`|b3e79d1fef4d80cbb3a4d60a1d000cefaa	allora. te lo dico da ragazzo io...  non ci sono uomini come li hai descritti tu.  tutti (e quelli che dicono di no, mentono) pensano al sesso almeno una volta al giorno. spesso sono pensieri di un momento del tipo "eh ma se avessi la ragazza...",, ma comunque ci pensiamo.  Quelli che riescono a piacere alle ragazze sono coloro che riescono a mascherare questo loro interesse o quei loro momenti di defaillances (spero di averlo scritto giusto) con educazione e morale.  Quindi...se tu vuoi un ragazzo, devi comunque mettere in conto che lui comunque ci pensa a certe cose.  Certo, sta con te perche gli piaci, per il carattere ecc...ma ci pensa lo stesso... Quindi e' possibile invitarlo ad aspettare un po perche non ti senti pronta, e spesso lui accetter, ma dipende anche dalla pazienza di quello che ti trovi di fronte.  Poi ci sono persone per le quali il sesso ha piu o meno importanza nel rapporto, e di conseguenza queste persone hanno piu o meno pazienza per quello che riguarda un rapporto senza sesso.  Gli uomini veri sono cosi. fattene una ragione e convivici.|`|5bae585c1654fecf2c6387e3fbf3ae04aa	AAAAAAAAA A A A ALL'ORATORIO...    ..

Esiste il BENE, l'affetto, questo si.    Ma prova a prendere una coppia qualsiasi, secondo te tutti sono "innamorati"? e soprattutto, pensi davvero che non esista nessun altro al mondo che possa essere migliore del proprio partner?    certo che si, ci si pu mettere con qualcuno, essere "innamorati".. Ma lo stesso sentimento si pu provare per migliaia di altre persone, che magari neanche ci sogniamo, ma in tutto il mondo... esistono!!    In poche parole, l'amore  un semplice pretesto per accontentare i desideri sessuali dell'uomo e quelli materni della donna. Gli animali sono fatti per questo, PROCREARE, non AMARE.    Quindi, in poche parole... divertiti, prova amicizia, affetto, quello che vuoi... Non hai niente di anormale.    Ciao!|`|3Ljp2H0Aaa	Evidentemente non hai trovato ancora qualcuno da amare.

La mia famiglia erano le mie amiche.   Mi sono sposata e neanche l le cose sono cambiate, criticavano l'educazione alle mie figlie, la mia casa, TUTTO! per questo ho messo di pi le distanze. Poi nel '93, c' stata la divisione dei beni..... agli altri TUTTO, a me una misera campagna. Ovviamente i mei fratelli hanno manovrato la faccenda, mettendo in evidenza il fatto che loro avevano lavorato e io studiato, che loro avevano sofferto e io no, che io ... in pratica un'assurdit. Mi sono ritrovata con le pive nel sacco e una famiglia che avrei voluto non avere. Mi avevano presa in giro! persino dove per legge dovevamo essere tutti uguali.   Purtroppo non sono capace di portare rancore anche se non dimentico, ma sono capace di lasciar passare il tempo per poi avere quello che mi spetta.   Ora siamo in questa situazione: il pi grande mi chiama per avere dei consigli. Gli altri due mi chiamano quando hanno bisogno.   Non ho ancora fatto niente. Aspetto. Il tempo paga. Ma io con gli interessi, mi dico tutti i giorni.  Per quanto mi riguarda per non ho pi permesso di criticarmi, ma ho fatto vedere ad ognuno i loro  limiti. Non ho fato loro nessuno sgarbo, semplicemente perch non ne sono capace. Ma ho cercato di dimostrare a me stessa soprattutto che si pu crescere anche senza l'appoggio degli altri e andando sempre contro corrente.   In bocca al lupo.|`|2a61337edd8f45a403d5a2c9b6dfbf27aa	si  una cosa normalissima piccola...poi io essendo figlio unico ancor di pi!!!|`|092a912631bd369e994820d0f6347078aa	Se dicessi in tutti i modi sarei ingiusta nei confronti di mio fratello maggiore, ma  vero che qualche ostacolo me lo ha creato o cmq ha contribuito.  Ha otto anni e mezzo pi di me e ricordo che, quando ero adolescente, spesso si alleava con i miei genitori e non con me, dicendo loro che avevano fatto bene a punirmi e/o a non permettermi di fare certe cose. Ricordo che, in occasione di uno dei miei primi filarini, invece di coprirmi, spiffer tutto SENZA PIETA' a mia madre quando lei gli chiese qualcosa, dandole ragione sul fatto che faceva bene ad impedirmi di vederlo (e, obiettivamente, in maniera immotivata, visto che il ragazzo in questione non era un drogato o un teppista). Onestamente non so se lo ha fatto per proteggermi o per il suo tornaconto, perch in fondo, quando io ero adolescente, lui aveva poco pi di venti anni e quindi pi i miei stavano appresso a me meno scocciavano e controllavano lui... forse una cosa non esclude l'altra...    Ad onor del vero per, non appena terminata (teoricamente) l'et adolescenziale, al contrario ha spesso preso le mie parti nei confronti dei miei ed incoraggiata ad essere meno dipendente dal loro benestare nelle mie decisioni.    Per (scusami la franchezza) dalle reazioni che hai avuto alle risposte degli utenti mi dai da pensare che forse, se hai problemi con i tuoi fratelli, non sia proprio solo per colpa loro ;)...

mVs8Skp7aa	C' una piccola incongruenza in quello che hai scritto e cio : sono sposata .... e sono felice !   Vedi il fatto che tu ti sia innamorata di una persona pu significare che in effetti , il matrimonio non era cos felie come lo avevi descritto e questo , a mio avviso , a giocato a favore dell' altro.  Vedi , posso dirti sez ombra di dubbio che per anni ed anni ho trascorso, sempre per periodi molto brevi per , la mia vita "sentimentale" tra una donna sposata ed .... una donna sposata e sempre nella pi profonda discrezione..   Vedi , le parole , i gesti , i convincimenti , il presentarsi in modo differente da marito, far parlare la donna e quindi regolarsi di conseguenza  stato in un certo senso il mio "pane mensile" (perch  tanto che duravano le relazioni) e pertanto facevano felici entrambi . Il mio lungo girovagare nel mondo intero non mi permetteva una relazione duratura ma ti posso assicurare che se fossi stato "felice" con una donna , non mi veniva nemmeno in mente di guardare altrove!    Dici che ti sei innamorata di un'altro oppure  quell'altro che ha fatto in modo che tu ti innamorassi? E' molto importante questa riflessione e ti prego di prenderla nella giusta maniera .     Se sei sposata "felicemente" , vuol dire che nel tuo uomo ci siano tutte quelle qualit che hai sempre cercato in un uomo e che quindi hai deciso di stare con lui per sempre.    Oddio , l'imponderabile pu sempre accadere ma ....... non  mai casuale e quindi ti prego di riflettere su quanto ho premesso e riflettici s : tutto dipende dall'uomo inoltre ed a questo proposito devo dire l'ultima cosa accaduta recentemente.  Attraverso un sito , sono stato contattato da una giovane donna , sposata e con un figlio di 16 anni che adora. E' evidete che i continui litigi hanno influito moltissimo sui rapporti tra la coppia non menomando in alcun modo l'affetto verso il loro figlio.  Avrebbero dovuto divorziare (o meglio l'idea stava venendo costantemente e giornaliermente alla donna la quale pensava ad un divorzio con il marito ma ..... non con il figlio) : insomma mi sono reso conto che il probabile divorzio sarebbe stato un grosso errore da parte sua e quindi .......... ho preferito abbandonare la partita per non scombussolare entrambe le esistenze.   (PS Da premettere che non era ancora accaduto nulla tra noi)  Rifletti quindi prima di parlare od agire, vedi prima chi  l'altro e in quale forma si manifesta il SUO amore ed il TUO e , qualora non dovessi avere figli , solo allora ti potresti sentire veramente libera di agire .    Ricorda che, in effetti ....... sei sempre felice con tuo marito !|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	hmmmm...Qualcosa non quadra...riflettici bene e cerca di essere onesta nei tuoi confronti... saprai benissimo quello che fare.       ciao|`|aac457332f350ca038048dfcda63d082aa	resta sposata e felice e continua a goderti il tuo innamorato che restera' tale proprio perche' esterno.  ciao auguri|`|58HO9HUNaa	bhe il perke lo conosci solo tu noi no certo. cmq forse nn sei felice sei convinta di esserlo  sl una convinzione tua ma in realta nn lo sei|`|Jik1kxHOaa	ma nn sei innamorata dai...ti piace solo un tizio...io ti do un consiglio...tu e tuo marito..stanotte fatevi uno di quegli sco.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ke lo fai rimanere in botta un giorno intero, fai cos tutte le sere, vedi ke stai mejo...quello passer...anzi..se dopo questa serie di botte notturne...ancora hai voja di quell'altro....dillo a tuo marito..parlatene, risolvete la questione, troverai la strada giusta..nn lasciare tuo marito...|`|4e52809b53adc71f56071362f2d8695faa	Che fare? la risposta la conosci mia cara, ma hai paura di seguirla... se hai figli pensa bene e magari fai una terapia, credi di essere felice ma nn lo 6, se  successo questo significa che c' un qualcosa che a te nn piace nel vostro rapporto e sicuramente l'altro (di cui ti sei innamorata) ha quel qualcosa di speciale.

Paradossalmente queste tendenze creano un circolo vizioso l' uomo che va con tante donne rimane affascinante anche se pericoloso , la donna che va con tanti uomini viene giudicata male!    Una inversione di tendenza ci potrebbe essere attraverso un maggior rispetto fra ragazzi e ragazze reciproco.  Un consiglio spassionato,andare anche con tante persone ,  non per farci urgentemente all'amore, ma per imparare a conoscerle, credimi questo si che  un esercizio difficile, e poi quando sar il momento si pu fare anche all'amore.

La grande meraviglia destata dalle "donne troppo belle" anche nelle altre donne difficilmente crea rivalit e, proprio perch considerate "inarrivabili" ,  se ne pu parlare liberamente.I  loro corpi perfetti,visi stupendi,  finiscono con il diventare  una sorta di "opere d'arte",   esposte  all'ammirazione  e ai commenti del pubblico .|`|Kcj6Uyavaa	Riconosco sempre quando una  una bella donna.

Pazienza se gli altri pensano che lo dica per invidia, in realt sono molto selettiva. Per esempio, un tipo come Juliana, quella di Cultura Moderna, abbronzata, mediterranea e prorompente, oltre che piena di personalit, per i miei canoni estetici  il top, mentre Lydie Pages pur essendo adorata dagli uomini per me non sa di niente.

MSFNZ8fuaa	Parlo per la mia poca esperienza in tema di Amore...  A me il matrimonio f e faceva paura, anche quando ero veramente innamorata del mio ex-fidanzato...ci pensavo, e certo mi sentivo felice, pensavo al fatidico giorno, alla gioia del condividere anche le piccole cose, cucinare insieme, fare dei pasticci con le pentole, con la lavatrice, con le camicie, ma essere cmq felici perch si era insieme e si stava crescendo insieme.....per, e c' sempre questo PERO', ammetto che a me spaventa molto l'idea del "sempre". (non mi sposerei di certo pensando: oh meno male che c' il divorzio!Penserei a una cosa "finch morte non ci separi"!)  Mi spaventa il pensiero di essere legata a una persona, non solo per i sentimenti (che possono sempre cambiare), ma per la legge italiana...mi spaventa il pensiero che non mi sentir pi libera di stare da sola, di viaggiare con le amiche, di conoscere gente nuova, anche amici uomini...perch purtroppo io sento troppo il rispetto per questo tipo di legame... una cosa stupida,lo so...per il rendere ufficiale una cosa, sancirla effettivamente nei confronti dello stato, mi fa venire l'ansia!! Comincio a pensare: oddio, e se poi non mi trovo con la sua famiglia? e se poi non ci stiamo dentro con i soldi? e se io non lo amassi pi? e se lui improvvisamente, da sposato, cambiasse faccia? diventasse uno che vuole la donnina di casa pronta a sfornare 5 figli? e se litighiamo per ogni cavolata, perch da sposati le cose si danno per scontate, ogni cosa  dovuta?   No no.....ho gi troppe preoccupazioni..... :o)  Preferisco un legame di cuori, semplice, spontaneo.... sentendomi "libera" di pensare al presente, con un p pi di serenit e spensieratezza,senza preoccuparmi fino all'esaurimento del futuro, del come sar, dei mille "se".....  Questo  il mio punto di vista, per ora....magari a 30 anni sar diversa....vedremo! :o)  Ciao!    PS: se  diventato tanto famoso l'aforisma "il matrimonio  la tomba dell'amore"....un motivo ci sar! :o)|`|RQsRao4Baa	non penso sia cos in assoluto.....potrebbe anche darsi..quando il matrimonio  sentito solo come il giusto completamento di un fidanzamento duraturo...ma pi in generale credo che faccia paura legarsi ad una persona per tutta la vita, le responsabilit di dover mantener salda la tua unione di fronte a tutti gli eventi che la vita ti prospetter di fronte...eventi che possono coinvolgere sia te che il tuo compagno o entrambi... un impegno serio che bisogno essere disposti e consapevoli di accettarlo e rispettarlo ...finch morte non vi separi!!!!e chi ama davvero sa che non  un'impresa facile difendere in ogni caso un'unione e rendere felice il proprio partner al di l di se stessi....|`|1Fi7sm3Laa	Se non si  innamorati abbastanza, o se anche non si ha maturato il concetto reale di matrimonio... che poi alla fine  un concetto fondamentale di "rispetto per l'altro e la presa di coscienza dell'impegno che comporta una relazione e la responsabilit. O si vuole oltre a questo ancora "giocare" con la vita. Non si  ancora maturi, a mio parere.|`|Yl7HNQFvaa	Fa paura sempre...come tutte le scelte importanti....tranne forse a chi  superficiale o sciocco.|`|TLQvlBSlaa	Direi di si. Se si  innamorati, si possiede la forza per affrontare qualsiasi cosa.|`|48qEbMG0aa	Credo proprio di si.  Quando ami realmente una persona non aspetti altro che condividere la tua vita con la sua.|`|1f023db3e89570f0653cae6cb45b9862aa	Il matrimonio non c'entra niente, niente, con l'amore, quando lo capirete? te lo dico io quando: dopo sposate, che vi renderete conto che quella merd@ di vita in cui siete piombate, quelle miserie quotidiane chiamate convivenza, quella condivisione di cesso e lavandino dei piatti sporchi, non era esattamente l'idiliio che pensavate quando eravate fidanzate e felici.    Meno male che c' il divorzio.|`|W40EtUFsaa	Io nn ho paura......e lo amo cn tutta me stessa...|`|A01BXU0Naa	no, si ha paura di tante cose quando ci si sposa...  Non credo che si ha paura solo se si  poco innamorati, ache perche se sie poco innamorati che senso avrebbe sposarsi?|`|rfhq5pofaa	No perch l'amore  solo il punto di partenza. La promessa di un impegno reciproco OGNI giorno per il resto della vita  qualcosa che va al di l del sentimento e una persona pu temere di non farcela, di non essere abbastanza forte.  C' chi teme l'evoluzione dell'amore, ma  una cosa normale che il sentimento cambi, che la percentuale dei suoi componenti, come la passione, varino.  Bisogna esserne consapevoli, accettare tale cosa, e scegliere il partner ogni istante, ogni giorno.   Anche la persona pi innamorata pu essere spaventata da ci..anche perch la monogamia  un'imposizione, non certo un'inclinazione secondo me. Che poi  questo il bello del matrimonio: l'impegno ed il senso di responsabilit.|`|JN0hy7WBaa	si o perche' nn si innamorati abbastanza o xche' e' abbastanza che si e' sposati!|`|kTm5TZFnaa	mah...forse fa paura anche se si  molto innamorati...per la paura che il rapporto cambi e possa andare male....|`|a4Hl7Alraa	credo che ad ognuno possa spaventare per diverse motivazioni.  Credo sia importante che un po spaventi, deve essere una responsabilit 'sentita' fortemente,  ci si deve interrogare.  Credo che l'importante sia non prenderla alla leggera.|`|6e0OHrIaaa	No,  l'idea di dover rinunciare alla propria totale indipendenza, a quello spazio piccolo, privato e segreto che resta tutto nostro finch viviamo soli o in casa con i nostri genitori, ma che inevitabilmente viene a perdersi quando dobbiamo condividere la nostra vita con un'altra persona diversa dalla famiglia...Bisogna vedere quanto siamo legati a questi nostri spazi privati, quanto ci costa rinunciarvi, ed  in proporzione a quel prezzo che si misura la riluttanza al matrimonio...|`|r2VXXH0Laa	Non credo .... spesso fa pi paura l'idea dell'impegno in se stesso.  Personalmente non ho paura, forse perch io e mio marito siamo innamorati, addirittura pi adesso che da fidanzati!  Secondo me il segreto  cercare sempre un dialogo e un confronto ....|`|HTJfmFBfaa	Credo, di si.|`|pRwI58xmaa	no..non credo..  penso siano le responsabilit che comporta che fanno paura..  specialmente con i figli..|`|LTQHkQWCaa	secondo me si altrimenti   un sogno|`|oDUFNERMaa	Ciao,  Io penso che certo, molte persone posso aver paura di sposarsi, ma non solo perch magari non  amore vero, le motivazioni possono essere molteplici (basta leggere le risposte degli altri per avere degli esempi!).  Trovo che sposarsi sia solo un fatto di "cartacce" inutili per due persone che si amano davvero,  superfluo...  Molte volte pu fare sentire le persone oppresse e obbligate una volta sposate, e questo pu rovinare un amore che in principio magari era davvero bello.  In poche parole il matrimonio pu spaventare in molti aspetti di se, ma se ci concentriamo pi sull'amore che sul matrimonio stesso, forse lo vivremo meglio un po tutti, cercando di coltivare di pi gli aspetti veramente importanti di una relazione.  Un bacione!!|`|R423tuTnaa	no, secondo me il matrimonio pu spaventare un pochino anche se si  follemente innamorati..ci sono tanti fattori, se non si  convissuto, bisogna tener conto che si andr a dividere la propria vita e la propria quotidianit con un' altra persona,  questo che spaventa..ma poi passa la paura!!|`|rEMtwV05aa	E' un grosso impegno.... ma arrivare a dire che fa paura....|`|dWAgsqqsaa	nn credo sia x qst, ma xk c' la paura ke un giorno l'amore finisca e quindi t ritrovi "infrattato" cn una xsona ke nn vuoi pi... e poi va b tutto il discorso separazione/divorzio/avvocati bal bla bla.. se io dovessi sposarmi (ke m piacerebbe davvero tanto) avrei un p d paura ke finisca cm x i miei genitori... ke sn andati avanti anni tra tribunale e avvocati.... l'amore secondo me nn centra, s ha paura del futuro... xk nn s pu sapere mai cm sar!! ^_^|`|z2azBEbvaa	si brava....se si ha paura significa che c'e qualcosa che nn va'...altrimenti bisognerebbe solo essere felici......e nn vedere l'ora che quel giorno arrivi....|`|yo0E4Zi2aa	fermaaaaaaaaa!!!!!senti ti parlo di esperienza personale...e normale...anche se lho ami da morire la paura ce sempre..e completamente normale..un matrimonio e un passo grande..e una risponsab.verso  il compagno nei tempi belli e brutti.......ma ne vale la pena.....im bocca al lupo:-)kisssssssssssssss|`|BupWalSFaa	Certamente...  Quando si ama davvero sposarsi  solo gioia infinita di aver reso un unione davvero completa e speciale, davvero forte ed immortale..    Se non si ama il "per sempre" terrorizza, se non si vogliono responsabilit il "per sempre" terrorizza lo stesso...    Buona giornata  Noir|`|bGN3cNYCaa	Fondamentalmente credo di si.  Per c' anche da valutare l'immaturit dei giovani di oggi, che non vogliono assumersi responsabilit sul capo...|`|954EiEskaa	non mi sono mai sposato, non credo in questo tipo di legame o meglio non credo che un legame si trasformi con un certificato e due anellini, non avrei nessun problema a farlo ma non l'ho mai considerato basilare, perch nella nostra societ il tema della morale  considerato un istituzione non una libera scelta, dettata dagli uomini e non dall'amore  poi a vedere certi matrimoni in giro sentirsi schifato  il minimo|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	..il matrimonio? Per me  accessorio,...ornamento , tradizione ( quanto odio questo termine !) ...in sostanza superfluo , maggiormente se deve fungere da prova ,dimostrazione e garanzia d'amore ," il contratto d'amore"  ...assurdo !

Infine c' la possibilit di andare in questo locale con un altro tipo ( magari un po' grosso ) e quando viene a servirti gl'e lo presenti come se fosse il tuo ragazzo    POSSIBILITA' 2 - Lui ti paice, allora magari hai fatto bene a non dargli il bacio e a farti desiderare un po', x prima  o poi gli potresti lasciare il tuo numero del cell scritto su un tovagliolo ( stile film )... e dopo da l viene tutto da solo.

Il rapporto tra due che si amano  molto complesso. Se due si sposano per amore e si desiderano fanno ci che vogliono.  Esistono persone che hanno delle paure pi o meno consce, ma nell'ambito di un rapporto d'amore queste paure vengono o superate o accettate come un desiderio dell'altra persona di non fare determinate cose.

Never on purpose.  But guys? A lot.  Thats why they show guys getting hurt there.    Really, girls don't have balls, if they get hit there, its just like getting hit on the shoulder, pain is minimal and lasts a few seconds.  girls don't fall on the floor and freak out about it.  Thats why they only show guys.    It really makes me wonder why you think about this. or even care enough to write a question about this. ... really?|`|krCEaFKgaa	i think that it hurts guys alot more but/and it is never right to hit/kick a girl as annoying as they can be somtimes if i ever meet a slob who would hit a girl i would lay them out it is not good to kick a guy in the balls for you might stop him from getting children or give him something bad... its not right for either|`|CINyzgbUaa	It's just a guy getting hit there means getting hit in the most sensitive spot in the (outer) male body lol.  Tons of nerves + no bones = lots of pain.   Girls are lucky enough to have those nerves behind skin and everything down there.|`|pRQHINiSaa	In Mr. Deeds a woman gets kicked in her vi-jay-jay|`|F1p6cnQYaa	because if you kick a guy in the balls its like kicking his manhood and it's not like that the other way around for women.|`|YvW9R0HJaa	It really hurts to kicked there;  but guys think it's funny to watch each other get hurt.     That's why we liked the movie "jackass", its why if someone gets hurt at work we rush home and tell people about it. Its a part of why we like contact sports, its why AMV is still on TV despite the fact that it's well passed its prime.     I guess it seems alot less common that women find humor in each others misfortunes. I have never seen women get drunk and saran wrap a toilet sit. |`|ZzHE0lvtaa	When did it become Ok to kick a guy there, my husband would hunt me down and I don't know what, never had big enough ones to try it lol.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Yeah I do that all the time to girls, its hillarious its called the c&nt punt.|`|FXR8v1POaa	it hurts. a lot.|`|u64JHUZsaa	yea, i wondered the same thing.|`|ZYUeEbI0aa	to keep it simple girl is more expensive...guys are cheap     |`|hyqf7xR0aa	uh... it's not okay the other way around. why would you think that?! |`|t6BiGUNSaa	what does chilvary mean? |`|peDJSnQPaa	its just a little wierd..|`|af321ba05f4c81cb60b15f7e75405971aa	It's frowned upon to hit girls in general...

This is serverly frowned upon by communities, especially with those who deal with the aftermath of the violence. When they show men getting hit its usually for humor or action sence where some one has used it for self defense ore somthing.   |`|08kRhPvDaa	I think it has to do with the whole "guy hitting a girl" thing.  you know, it's considered beating a woman?  That's why a girl can hit a guy but not the other way around.    Although, I'd have to admit it'd be funny ... i don't think we're ready for it, yet.    Barriers have come down over time, the first african american playing baseball, first man on the moon.  And soon, one day, a guy kicking a girl in her vag.  We can only dream.  .... a brighter future? totally.|`|HcbEU2scaa	Chivalry.

WRONG.|`|d08rkYlpaa	In most of the world, it is encouraged to marry your cousin, but discouraged to have sex with any member of your family closer than that. In half the USA it is legal to marry your cousin, with some restrictions.  It is not the norm in Louisiana to have sex with siblings, or parents with their own children. But I would be lying if I said it does not happen. Research has estimated 10-15% of the general population as having at least one incest experience. Among women, research by Russell and Wyatt estimates as high as twenty percent. There are rules against it in all cultures, but it is not illegal in all countries - the industrialized nations of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Israel, and Japan do not have laws against consenting adults having incest, nor do a few countries in the developing world.|`|Wpq4qUllaa	if it's like a third cousin or something I expect it's legal or whatever, if it's a parent or sibling, then ugh i don't even want to justify this with a response!|`|x68KtQUcaa	This is so nasty, so immoral and a big sin! |`|jLrGAPbmaa	Incest is an universal taboo.|`|2rzWHWUIaa	if that's the only way you can get some.. then knock yourself out sparky|`|veZ0o1RUaa	it's morally and biblically wrong!   and also it's genetically incompatiable! you'll make mutated childred. |`|LsNELr3Qaa	D'kno it doesn't happen in Philadelphia PA.

Troll!|`|90DKeNZbaa	WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU!!! ARE YOU OUTTA YOUR MIND!! THAT IS NOT NORMAL.....SPREAD THE WORD......IT IS NOT COOL TO HAVE SEX WITH FAMILY MEMBERS|`|DDt62ijfaa	Well, depends what you mean by 'family member'. Are you talking about immediate blood-related family like brother/sister, because if you are then yep, totally wrong both scientifically and morally. In some countries it's customary to marry your cousins so I guess the sex thing isn't an issue for them, but it still seems quite inappropriate. Then you've got distant relatives and second cousins, brother/sister in laws, that kind of thing. That's a bit of a grey area but honestly, there's a whole lot of people in the world and surely there's someone you're not related to that you could have sex with.|`|xTPS7POeaa	The only family member you should have sex with is yourself!!|`|OiMcj6bIaa	My answer  In onother forum that relates in this question.  Because Some people are just born Idiot. Uncivilized, Bad parenting, Bad Government. If you agree then you dont need to read all this but Some people need to know ,so they can understand what the hell Im talking about. I hope. Anyways, I said this things because some people are just Idiot start from the Parents who didnt maybe goto school, maybe dont have a safe house to go boom boom! hahahaha! thats funny I know. didnt know that their kids is listening or maybe even watching ahuh! then obcorse time goes by their kids start experementing so you cant really blame the kids. 2nd is their probaly uncivilized to far from school, far from city, far from news no TV Or radio anything were they cant listen to some information or advice. So they get bored and what do you know if they tought about going to the woods and shag each other. what can I say its a great and unexplained feelings! hmmmm. then I also blame the government cause If a country of its government and do what they supposed to do, Making rules , regulation, policies and Implementing it like one of this matter then atleast It will minimized this type of situation. Some people just cant survive because of its goverment, No jobs, insted of the gov making sure specially the poor being taking care off they are doing the opposite stealling and corrupting this poor people. Anyone got an oppinion please reply or judge. Im up for a challenge specially those college bullshit people cause Im just a high school gradute. |`|fVyaJMvFaa	Augh, ever heard of the word INCEST?!|`|PTLWkIdIaa	It's extremely wrong. 
AA10399704	You're torn between two guys!  A lot of girls will think you're lucky!  But you're really in a tough spot because its very hard to date two guys.  If you know who you really love and its not your boyfriend then you need to tell him and be honest because you both deserve to be with someone you really love not kinda love.  But before you let your boyfriend go be sure that's what you really want.  Remember its human nature to want what we can't have.  But that doesn't necesarily mean its good for us.  So take some time to think and I hope you make the right decission because only you can make this decission.|`|AA10044768	go out with whom you wish, you are free to see who you please|`|AA10862299	You sound like a clueless , young but nice little girl.

Don't tie yourself to one person until you are in love. If you do, then that relationship is headed for disaster. Love has to go both ways for a relationship to work.
ffe88f2196f12ed2eb79e9a703728ef2aa	It's not you with the problem its the friends you pick.  You sound like a very caring,friendly, and trusting person.  Sometimes people take advantage because they are jealous of what you have.  That is their problem.  You have a right to be happy!      Do NOT let people take advantage of you.  This is not how a real friend behaves.  Stand up for yourself!  If you no your friend is lying I would confront her and ask her why she is making up things for and tell her real friends dont do that, and you wont tolerate it!!      Get involved in activities you like and meet new friends who will be happy for you and not treat you like this.  good luck!|`|b6b1a5ba089898bc73e7081ef7703fb4aa	Fuckin' christ, learn to spell you retard!|`|tN3c3X4Gaa	doesnt even make sense.|`|473c8320e5d1fb84ed39954d49457de1aa	what Tellus A said

(Esperienza personale) La vera eleganza non e' fatta dall'abito firmato e dai divani in pelle dell' autosuperlusso, ma da come ci si comporta. Per colpire al cuore una donna basta anche un'utilitaria se sai come si fa. E mettere una donna a proprio agio non e' "abbassarsi", ne tantomeno portarla in un MC Donald. La classe non e' acqua e non basta esibire un rolex al polso per essere una persona davvero elegante.|`|pRwI58xmaa	sinceramente mi andrebbe bene anche un panino mangiato su una panchina pur di stare insieme.  anzi forse  pi intimo|`|DmhR2Dwhaa	partendo dal fatto che con l' uomo che descriveri tu sarei abbastanza a disagio,sarei contenta se mi portasse da mc donald's !mi sentirei sollevata.anche se il cibo del mc non mi fa impazzire 2 patatine e una coca le prendo volentieri.anche se preferirei mi portasse a mangiare pane e porchetta!gna gnam e poi scusa ma sai che figata entrare da mc donald's vestiti da sera??|`|JrC09sOeaa	mi passa per la testa di ordinare un doppio cheeseburger con patatine giganti e cocacola...dopo 2 ore a teatro per quanto sia bello uno ha fame!!!|`|YJKeHczGaa	bh che  un po un idea bizzarra xr ke va bene... mc men cicken grazie!|`|vpLPlrEpaa	secondo me l'ha fatto per ridere, per alleggerire la serata, per dare un tono meno formale all'incontro..  l'avesse fatto con me, gli avrei proposto pizza e birra sul cofano dell'auto!

Gli studi hanno dimostrato che pi che per gusto Mc Donald's rappresenta uno stile veloce e omologato, che non genera cattive sorprese..  Il punto  che ti porti l ad un primo appuntamento...  Le opzioni sono 2..  1: Che il tipo sia nato nel giusto ambiente non significa che vi appartenga, gli arricchiti sono tanti, e vestirsi con abiti firmati non significa essere eleganti. Quindi significherebbe che in realt la macchina e il teatro sono solo un modo per darsi delle arie, ma lui in realt non rispecchia quel tipo..    Sinceramente, non credo sia cos...    2: seconda ipotesi. Un uomo insicuro non porterebbe mai una donna da Mc, portarla in un ristornate costoso non era assolutamente difficile,anzi pi semplice.  Credo che abbia voluto spiazzare la tua amica invece.  Magari  lei a darsi troppe arie e a non poterselo permettere.  E lui si  divertito a spiazzarla...per vedere la sua reazione.  Riuscendoci.  La spiegazione della tua amica infatti  divertentissima.  Il fatto che lei abbia letto nel comportamento di lui una specie di "discriminazione"  indice del fatto che qualche complesso ce l'ha. Forse sa di aspirare ad uomini che in realt non si pu permettere.  Io mi sarei fatta una risata...   Se fino a quel momento il mio giudizio fosse stato di un uomo di classe, ironico e buon gusto..non sarebbe stato certo un Mc Donald's a cambiarlo..  Per...tornata a casa gli avrei scritto un sms:   "Serata deliziosa ma... non te l'ho detto per non metterti in imbarazzo...sono intollerante alla farina...  il panino mi coster una settimana di disintossicazione...per ne valeva la pena"  Se tiene a me...Mc Donald's sar solo un ricordo...

It might be possible that there are restrictioins for him to date outside his religion.  I've known this guy since elementary school. It's been over 20 years since we graduated high school. We are just now getting together and going on our first date very soon. I've always liked him and we've always had fun just like your having.   Just remember, why ruin a friendship when you know a relationship can't work out.  Good Luck!

Inedito!|`|45SiifxYaa	spesso molto,ma molto di piu'.|`|a6ByFipSaa	la canzone di mia martini si riferisce a una donna sfortunata in amore ovvio  la capacit di amare  diversa da uomo a uomo (uomo nel senso di essere umano) e non  necessariamente collegata con l'appartenenza a un sesso piuttosto alla percentuale di egoismo insita in  noi|`|wOxA82RGaa	Secondo me ha ragione la martini....gli uomini non possono amare come noi donne siamo in due poli distindi diversi opposti e per questo c'e' l'attrazione....se si fosse su due poli uguali...ci respingeremmo.|`|XVuHstj1aa	 un amore diverso, complementare a quello delle donne. ma non  detto che sia inferiore in quantit o in qualit.|`|M3LKl9zKaa	Io credo che l' uomo in generale sia pi egoista della donna, quindi pu amare in maniera molto intensa, ma si tiene sempre una piccola parte di s che non concede, per pudore,per paura, per pigrizia, per retaggi che non gli consentono di abbandonarsi completamente ai sentimenti. Spesso la donna ama in modo pi "totale" perch  pi abituata a farlo. O forse  solo pi abituata ad esternare i sentimenti. Per, non essendo una donna, esprimo solo un'opinione. |`|EUFttuuBaa	io sono dell'idea che una cosa grande e bella come l'Amore non possa essere generalizzata cos. Ci sono le "eccezioni" sia nell'uomo che nella donna...C' l'uomo fedele e la nonna che tradisce e viceversa,c' la donna che ama e l'uomo che non la ama.

Sono d'accordo che la donna possa fare gli stessi lavori dell'uomo, abbia (logicamente) gli stessi diritti, ma ragazze, siete diverse da noi. Credo sia un discorso "naturale" se cosi non fosse forse, non ci sarebbe neanche l'amore.  L'uomo per indole  pi schivo nel mostrare certi sentimenti, ma tranquille, amiamo anche noi e spesso finch' morte non ci separi.  Ciao|`|QhQM3S4waa	Anche se non si  pu generalizzare ,   le donne sicuramente sono pi portate ad amare ,hanno le caratteristiche mentali per il donarsi.|`|2a61337edd8f45a403d5a2c9b6dfbf27aa	secondo me  una cazzata gigantesca...non dipende dal sesso ma dalla persona...un uomo  capace di amare come e pi di una donna|`|ZdQhVlT5aa	secondo me non e' una questione di sesso...ma di persone e carattere.... a me le mie amiche hanno sempre detto " sei come un uomo"!!!!!    E ho un'amico al quale dicono "sei come una donna" .... ( ovviamente riferito a come gestivamo i nostri sentimenti e amorazzi....    beh...cmq non ci siamo messi insieme noi due!    diciamo che le donne sono schiave da secoli di pregiudizi e tabu inculcate da un'educazione cattolica e molto maschilista....  Le donne tendono a considerare piu' una cosa "viscerale" ed eterna un'amore....boh?    Non le ho mai capite le mie amiche...io non ho mai pianto per un ragazzo.....  mi sono divertita un sacco e ora sono anche felicemente sposata!      |`|430ca25032a4d80cde13b9fc4b6f136aaa	assolutamente si, anzi ti dir un'altra cosa. Se l'uomo  veramente innamorato sa amare pi profondamente della donna.E comunque hanno il loro modo di farlo ed il fatto che non stiano sempre li ad accarezzarci e coccolarci, o che dimentichino una chiamata o arrivino in ritardo ad un appuntamento o che possano fare delle piccole cose che per noi sono una tragedia,non significa che non amino come noi. In maniera diversa forse... |`|tgayppBBaa	tutti gli esseri umani sono capaci di amare allo stesso modo.... ma lo dimostrano in modi diversi.... le donne sono + coccolose, baci, abbracci, carezze e parole dolci sussurrate nell'orekkio....  gli uomini, x qualke motivo ancora sconosciuto, si vergognano a dimostrare teneramente il loro affetto..... e hanno un modo tutto loro di volersi bene e di amare.,.. sinceramente io non ho kapito ankora come.... ma in certe occasioni sanno ricoprirti di un amore immenso, proprio qnd meno te lo aspetti, te lo dimostrano nella loro lingua ke ti sembra di comprendere x la prima volta.... ed  una cosa bellissima!!|`|zkBoxB6Maa	Io fino a qualke tempo fa la pensavo cm te invece da qnd sto cn il mio attuale ragazzo ho cambiato radicalmente idea!

Le pi belle poesie d'amore, le opere d'arte dedicate a questo sentimento sono in gran parte opera degli uomini.

Certo che gli uomini possono amare tantissimo, quanto le donne appunto. Non credo sia una questione di sesso...  Anche perch in questo caso Petrarca, Dante ecc...Dove li metti?|`|LtQ2UgpKaa	no mi dispiace contaddirti  ma non  che non sono capaci  diciamo piuttosto che sono molto meno di voi donne  in rapporto di 5 uomini su 100 donne  ciao kiss.|`|EkR1udlDaa	assolutamente si..uomini e donne sanno amare allo stesso identico modo..|`|jZSvjHdNaa	Secondo me QUANDO gli uomini amano, riescono ad amare anche quanto le donne.  Certo  difficile capirli, come per loro forse a volte  difficile capire noi, perch siamo diversi e abbiamo modi diversi, ma non meno intensi ed efficaci, di esprimere le emozioni.    Per quanto riguarda la canzone si riferisce a tutti quegli atteggiamenti degli uomini che fanno pensare che non possano provare dei sentimenti anche quando dicono di amare. Io penso che quando un uomo ha gli atteggiamenti che sono descritti nella canzone da Mia Martini  semplicemente perch non sono innamorati.  Quelli innamorati si comportano in maniera decisamente diversa...  Considera anche il finale della canzone...."gli uomini che cambiano sono quelli innamorati come te"    ..........e poi, detto tra noi, a chi non  capitato, dopo una cocente delusione d'amore, di pensare che gli uomini sono insensibili e non sono capaci di amare?!  Il segreto sta solo nel trovare quello giusto, credimi :)    Guarda la mia dmanda di un p di tempo fa:    http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|AeiAwoZ6aa	amare allo stesso modo? ... forse alle volte gli uomini amano di pi ma le donne non capiscono il modo di amare degli uomini, perch pensiamo in due modi diversi, che cosa ami del tuo ragazzo?|`|2YALKzgaaa	i greci dicevano che le donne non amano sono solo lo specchio dell'amore dell'uomo verso di loro perch in quanto considerate cose non sono in grado di provare alcun sentimento....la nostra socet si  molto evoluta da allora...e se credi nella parit dei sessi sai anche che la donna e l'uomo sono uguali e in quanto tali amano tutti e due in maniere profonde ma anche profondamente diverse...nessuna delle due  sbagliata...a noi sembra di amare di piu...loro credono di amarci di piu...il solo fatto  che non ci capiamo tra di noi ma in realt possiamo amarci allo stesso modo! |`|1Vw6kC5Laa	io credo ke dipende...ci sn ddelle donna anke ke nn amano ma se mettiemao a kofronto un uomo e una donna ke amano alla follia di sikuro vicer la donna  domani mi dv alzare alle 9 ho sonnooooooooo hiih kiss|`|QxOTVtIraa	secondo me non ce un metro per l'amore per misurare chi ama di piu' o di meno, cambia solo e solamente il modo di farlo e la maniera di dimostrarlo!! saluti a tutti|`|V7YwVm0gaa	 una bellissima e triste canzone , come mamma di due maschi penso che amano e perdono la testa ma restano pi razionali della donna , dipende molto dal grado di emotivit, ma perdono la testa , chi li conosce bene s  se sono fragili.il mio papere da donna  che noi si cerca un compagno che collabori pronto a non farsi schiacciare dai problemi quotidiani e se l amore viene a mancare si chude , coltivare aria porta tempesta ,abbiamo il desiderio di un amore a lungo termine ,ma gli uomini sono attratti dal nuovo , i fiori non colti sono i pi intriganti e penso che non siamo (tutti) monogami ,  un invenzione umana il matrimonio per tutta la vita ,ci stiamo avvicinando a vivere diversamente i rapporti d amore con pi maturit da parte della donna , con meno romanticismo e illusione sulla fedelt ,di sicuro ho pi amiche che hanno amato a lungo ,anche quando hanno chiuso definitivamente continuano ad amare per anni . restano sole per lunghi tempi i miei amici hanno sempre una donna nuova a volte se gli chiedi : ti intriga ? ti piace ? , rispondono :  una donna .. non sono innamorati ma sentono il bisogno di una donna vicina ,,, evviva le differenze|`|bAqzzxrraa	poi dite ke siamo noi a discriminarvi..... non e vero ma sai quante volte o pianto x amore??? ke ne sai di tutte le volte ke uno cerca di recuperare un rapporto?? ke ne sai del dolore ke si sente quando la tua fiducia viene tradita???? cara mia noi amiamo come voi.... e soffriamo se nn veniamo ricambiati...|`|YTSv8bwqaa	Secondo me alcuni uomini sanno amare molto... e certe donne possono anche nascondersi...

Un uomo ama esattemente nella stessa misura di una donna. Che una donna ami pi di un uomo  un luogo comune. L'amore  totalmente universale, farne questioni sessiste  riduttivo e permettetemi offensivo. Culturalmente le donne sono piu spronate fin da bambine a esprimere i propri sentimenti, mentre i bambini vengono scoraggiati dal farlo (al bambino che piange viene detto di non fare la femminuccia,io ho 2 figli maschi e non ho mai detto loro una cosa cosi scema) Se alleviamo i nostri figli scoraggiandoli dal prendere contatto con le proprie emozioni  normale che da adulti abbiano difficolta sia nell'esprimerle che nel maneggiarle. Credo che il vero problema sia questo|`|FsBNumXNaa	ti rispondo con una battuta: gli uomini tengono ad essere i primi per una donna,ma le donne pretendono sempre di essere le ultime!!!|`|4HvihlHsaa	secondo me il livello d'amore pu essere uguale sia nella donna che nell'uomo,solo ke la donna forse  pi sdolcinata,lo da pi a vedere,mentre l'uomo  pi riservato!credo ke sia cos!ciaoooo!:-)|`|oW0PRv3Maa	Questo genere di domande mi intristiscono.  Come mi intristisce da morire quella canzone.....splendida, per carit.....ma figlia del solito clich che vede la donna come l'unica depositaria della capacit d'amare.    Gli uomini amano. In modo struggente, anche. La loro natura gli fa esprimere i sentimenti in modo diverso da noi, ma come si pu pensare che solo per questo non amino?  Una persona che non versa lacrime, significa che non soffre?  Una persona che non grida e si dispera, significa che non prova dolore?    Ripeto, questi luoghi comuni mi intristiscono da morire.  Penso agli uomini innamorati che ho conosciuto, a quanto si spendono, alle loro parole che suscitano una tenerezza infinita, e mi sembra che si faccia loro un torto enorme a non crederli nemmeno CAPACI di quel che portano nel cuore.|`|Q6U7IZIaaa	No; in generale, no.   Esistono sicuramente delle eccezioni. E non  assolutamente questione di parit dei sessi  la quale, tra laltro,  ancora ben lontana dallessere realizzata, e forse non lo sar mai.  Forse si tratta di qualcosa dinnato: le donne sono potenzialmente tutte madri, e non fanno altro che partorire simbolicamente. Quindi, sofferenza damore, dedizione, sopportazione dellinsopportabile, contenimento dellincontenibile, perdono dellimperdonabile.  Non escludo che esistano anche uomini capaci damare con la stessa esagerazione tipica di noi donne; nel mio caso, ne ho incontrato uno solo cos. E uomini ne ho avuti pure troppi, sempre cercando un inesistente amore.  Gli uomini riescono pi facilmente a scindere sesso da amore; noi ne siamo quasi del tutto incapaci. Ci innamoriamo sempre!  E poi, noi donne continuiamo ad amare anche quando veniamo lasciate, mentre gli uomini tendono ad odiare e demonizzare la donna che li ha delusi.|`|i9eRddp9aa	per me non  questione di quantit di amore,bensi di modo di amare...non posso generalizzare perche a mio parere l amore non dipende dal sesso di un individuo ma dal suo cuore,cmq in linea di massima credo ke le donne riescano meglio a manifestarlo rispetto agli uomini...non mi sento di esprimere giudizi sicuri ma ad esperienza posso dire ke le donne amano non piu,non meno degli uomini ma semplicemente in maniera diversa..ciauu|`|VEIqQ4QKaa	Guarda che anch ele donne sanno essere bastarde in questo settore il chi ama di pi e chi ama di meno non dipende da  uomo o donna, ma dalla storia, dalle persone che la vivono...e tante altre cose!

Dunque per trovar l'amore vero ed eterno (eterno cmq  una parola troppo forte perch nessun sa in anticipo se sar per tutta la vita) , bisogna essere recettivi di tutte le onde che un altro lui di fronte ti pu comunicare con un sorriso, una bella bocca , una bella voce per esempio. Ma anche il suo modo di pensare o di far delle battute pu travolgerti. Nell'attesa che succeda, devi occuparti della tua persona e vivere pienamente e felicemente le tue giornate.

At least you admit you did something wrong.<br>  FYI, no she probably isn't ok, and you've just lost any respect she had for you. You can try apologizing but she's probably scared sh*tless of you anyway.|`|f1f8f169b74b19fb138f1875e2f48967aa	First you apologize by bringing her some nice flowers and candy and a card that says who sorry you are, than you explain that may be you should take a few days and not see each other. try this and see if it works.....<br>  <br>  When my wife is mad at me this usually works..|`|yLhp43T2aa	just tell her your really sorry. tell her it was an aciident. tell her you love her. i think she will forgive you afterall she is your girlfriend.|`|pRF5LLloaa	You are right -- you need help. <br>  <br>  And this was NOT an accident.  An accident is when you sit down on the couch to have a discussion and the lamp falls over.  Hitting your girlfriend is a sign of uncontrolled anger.  it WILL get you into trouble.  Even now, she could have you arrested for Assault with Battery.<br>  <br>  You IMMEDIATELY call you family doctor, and ask for a referral to a psychiatrist.  you set up the necessary meeting, and you MAKE THAT MEETING.  You ask the psychiatrist to either help you or refer you to Anger Management Classes.  Then , you complete THAT program.<br>  <br>  Physical violence is NEVER the answer in ANY personal relationship.  You don't slam doors you don't hit the wall, you don't throw things, and you NEVER hit, punch, or even TOUCH someone else except hugging as an expression of love.<br>  <br>  It speaks well of you that you are worried.  i hope that you are worried enough to do the right thing. CALL THE PSYCHIATRIST and get your  treatment started.|`|AA10313787	You already took the first step now follow through and get help for your anger problem|`|ML1zkPibaa	Why are you apologizing in cyberspace?  <br>  <br>  You need to go and apologize to her.  But when you do, realize that she could very well end the relationship...and she has every right to do so.<br>  <br>  You need to own up to the consequences of your actions.  And don't ever hit her again...whether it's an "accident" or not.  No one deserves that.|`|PbwCVPL1aa	If u hit her out of anger, then u need to get some counseling for your anger. Once a man hits a women and doesn't get help for it and wants help, then he will hit her over and over again. My sisters husband use to do that, I saw him beat her like a man and she let him get away with it, so he always did it. Still does and it's been a lot of years. So if I were u I would get help with my anger if thats what it was. I wasn't there, so I don't know what happened.|`|UHw7Vc3Faa	How dare you hit a woman.

04848217beeabc7944806e1490766e59aa	I honestly believe the best kind of relationship is one with a friend. You know their mood swings, their good as well as bad. A friend of mine will date or befriend someone for 6 months. If he feels that a relationship can develop, he goes for it. Why ruin a friendship when you know a relationship won't work out.  If you had a good friend, just like you... what advise would you give this person? Your advise would be the best - cause you know yourself better than anyone. Good Luck in your decision.|`|291e63bddceac9ef273b45fec690c82baa	tell her how u feel, before u get ur heartbroken,if she understand she might like bac , i will neva knoe till u ask|`|c8dc9e639b3555b8cd08538ad199720baa	This is a tough one, but it seems likt you both have a connection.

It sounds to me like she's interested in you, and she may feel the same way but is just too afraid to make the first move. Maybe this guy she's talking about is just a way to make you jelous. Either way, i never told that friend and i regretted it later because he went out with all these girls that were really wrong for him. You should tell her how you feel, it may be awkward at first but the worst thing that could happen is she tells you she doesn't feel the same way. At least you can be relieved that you have an answer and go on being friends.

TEuitljgaa	You want this to remain strictly a friendship, right? If so, then just try to start conversations with him. Talk about a movie or tv show or band you both like. You can't force him to talk to you, though. If he doesn't want to talk then there is nothing you can do.     If you want this to turn more into a friendship, I suggest you don't do that because you said he has a girlfriend.|`|ejrxNVD1aa	talk to him wen he is around his friends if he can,t have alone time with you join the conversation smile and laugh wen they said something humorous its how i got my guyfriend to talk to me he used to not say a word 2 me and since we have known each other for 7 months we talk|`|YHkH24yZaa	id just bring up a conversation and try to keeps the coversation going|`|fYRhsh0Daa	well if you want to pursue him romantically, back off he's taken.  but if you want to just be friends just make small talk when he's at your house and he should gradually talk more.|`|imS1qNoLaa	find out stuff he lieks and avratise it. .[=  (did i spell it right]  and dress and look the way he lieks .|`|VS4sDJDfaa	Go up to him and shout in his year "Talk to me dammit!"

Tell him you do like  him and wished you had the oportunity to show him.  You could mention if things don't work out with his current girl, that you wouldn't mind going on a few dates to see where is leads.  That will def give him something to think about.  And he just may act upon it. Best of luck!|`|OQ6U0Rmuaa	hes in a serious relationship now.. i would leave the two of them alone..   jsut because he liked you first it dont mean anything. |`|FwOXyljxaa	if he has a gf back off until they break up, then make a move. if you never had a bf then he can be your 1st bf ! :] have fun and good luck.  ps- i am sure he likes you too |`|WVPPpYuVaa	I think he meant that you guys are gonna be in a serious relationship.

He probably still likes you. If you like him as much as you're saying you do on the computer, go for it! That's what life's about. If he leaves that girl for you then you know it was meant to be, but if he stays with her, then either it's because he's not ready or it's not meant to be. I'd go for it though!

7o9kV8b1aa	yea bcuz girls usually think guys want what they cant have
w3CZrJ7iaa	They both seem to like you. One way to tell without talking to them is to really observe their actions and see how they act towards you. If you do something that shows you like them and they back away, they don't like you. But if they act interested and do something beyond the limits of platonic friendship, they like you. The one who teases you sounds as if he probably wants a hookup, especially if he's flirting with other girls too.|`|K7vCWru6aa	WOW they like whoever it is.....|`|iuPTJmStaa	Well, don't focus on all of them! Is there one you are attracted to? If not, just flirt and have fun. But if there is a guy that you think you want to be with, then the best way is just ask him to do something. Not like a date, just, a favor. If you ask him to help you do something boring and not a lot of fun, and he jumps at the chance, then you know he likes you! If a guy likes you, he'll do anything to be with you, even if it is paint the house!|`|2dNPTjxzaa	well i have to say that that is a pretty rough position to be in. so i'll start off by saying that a bunch of boys hide that they like you until they know if you like them back. i know this because i'm a guy and all my friends always talk to me about that sorta stuff... anyways just blush a couple times looking back at em smiling when you are in class if either of em sit behind you. then look for simple signs such as thay try to hang out with you more often, or the unexpected start a rumor about you (if they try to stop it in front of you they like you no dur).
GvrGP92daa	well.   if you see him in the hallway, just say "hey, haven't seen you in forever how are you?"   Or if you don't see him in the hallway, maybe start up a conversation via myspace, facebook. or any of those. |`|Ew0ZHfRraa	PUT IT OUT TWAT

gGW0L7Caaa	I love it when a girl makes the first move and are confident.  Its a big turn on.|`|14BbtPH6aa	My boyfriend loves it that i tell him everything. He likes to know every little thing i do, as i like it from him, because it makes us feel closer. If i dont tell him something, or dont want to, he gets sad like i dont trust him with something. Though we've worked through that  now.  But, it honestly depends on the relationship, and the people. If you've been with someone for just a week or so, dont go telling them everything about your life in an instant. It will get boring, but do be open.    Confidence is a good idea, just not too confident.   Be yourself, so someone can appreciate the real you.  Having fun, one important thing definitely.  Don't flirt with other people, even though he might not show it it will make him upset.  He may want you all to himself, so let him, but if you're a person who needs space, make sure he knows.    Goodluck & all the best ?    .xx

If her spending habit is a problem for you, it might not be a good idea to get too seriously involved. Like it or not, money is important in life and particularly in marriage. It's not being shallow, it's just being practical.    If you've told her what you think, you should consider letting her live her life as she thinks best. Maybe her spending habits aren't a problem for her, or maybe she'll change them someday -- but if and when she does change, it should really be for her own benefit and not to please someone else.    Of course, it is possible to make it work. If so, it would be best to have some sort of plan in advance so that she can spend as she likes and you can save as you like. That does give you a risk of being taken advantage of, but there's a risk in everything, isn't there?    I guess you just have to decide if you can be happy together with such different views on money. Whatever you do, don't rush into any commitment. Good luck.|`|cacb4a41f28d6dc3b08028524fa1d30aaa	ASK HER IF SHE IS TRYING TO USE YOU THEN IF YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH YOU WILL FEEL THE DIFFERENCE|`|f209279ec71a408f5c0d63743e846596aa	Maybe you should talk to her about both of your future and tell her what you think about her spending habits..if she really love and respect you,she'll think about it.so far,it's ok if  she doesn't spend your money..tell her to buy things she really need to use only..of course this habit cant be stop immediately,try to ask her to budget...and cut her habit slowly....i'm sure she'll thank you in future!|`|AA11028982	You can, but she will always have to have her own job, her own bank account, her own debts.

I would dump her unless she gets therapy for her spending addiction.|`|9887f1a78199a7184e0808fb77a11244aa	Tell her and listen to the first guy.|`|AA10078422	None of us here are perfect. But, if you really love this girl, you would accept her the way she is. You can't pick and choose the traits that you like. None of the partners that you'd eventually meet, in case you break up with her, are going to be custom made. I'm sure there are several things about you that irritate her. You could talk to her and let her know that you'd prefer if she could marginally limit her expenses.|`|71555e151570f4cc7cc9b901582d6a01aa	I guess the only question there is here is...when she spends alot of money is she negleting her priorities. She may be a spender but does she spend so much money she can't pay her bills? Women like to shop plain and simple but these questions u need to be asking yourself is does she know when spending too much is spending too much. Not a lot of people will spend so much money that they are forced out on the streets. Take that in to consideration and sit down with her and talk about it. Always be honest. tell her ur concerns. Whether she likes to live life to the fullest or not, if she cares she will listen to ur concerns

Maybe your friends don't like her for you, they might be just  protecting your feelings, for sure they have a good reason for that..ASK..    SOLUTION 2: Amanda  If Amanda cannot easily decide to whom she shall say "Yes" then don;t rush her. I guess she's thinkin about it.. but you must know where you are in her life.. If she likes you or not? ASK..    Sometimes the answers were right infront of you, you just have to got the courage to face it..|`|AA11310595	This girl obviously doesn't know what she wants, or doesn't know how to tell you she doesn't want to be with you. Chances are things won't work out with her. I suggest moving on or maybe even showing her you won't be there waiting anymore... like hang out with other girls. Not to make her jealous but just to make her realize if she wants you or not. Good Luck.

04848217beeabc7944806e1490766e59aa	Wheather your bi or not with your situation, who says you've got a choice to make between these two? You can get provisions for yourself and the baby and do it on your own. Adoption is another alternative. These two can be part of the baby's life but not under the same roof. You are able to do this on your own - with the help from the social service office you will be provided well with food, clothing and help in finding a home.  I think you would make a bad decision if you considered a continued relationship with either one since you've already had a negative experience with both.  Find a close family member or friend to help you through this. You should be able to bind a close relationship with your social worker. If their not receptive, ask for another and then another until you find one that has your interests at heart. You will be led in the right direction and you will be proud that you were able to accomplislh this alone. Letting someone be part of your life with your baby is wrong especially when you know the fit wasn't right to begin with. You don't need this drama. Be strong honey in your decisions.

La famiglia  un'amore divino,nessuno dovrebbe intromettersi quando due persone raggiungono questo stadio, e poi pensa, cosa penseresti  tu se un gorno la persona di cui ti sei innamorata e che hai sposato, ti mettesse da parte per un'altra??  Ci sono tante persone libere.. che non fanno altro che aspettare la persona giusta per loro per poi poter creare una famiglia..rispettiamo l'amore e il matrimonio, sono due valori importanti.

I problemi di cuore lasciano una scia di lacrime e turbamenti ma guariscono, pi o meno velocemente. E spesso la persona che prima ti faceva ridere  la stessa che ora ti fa piangere. Tutto passa o tutto si risolve e quando il cuore ritorna libero si emoziona pi intensamente di prima.

c8BVuakHaa	Nella mia esperienza di vita ho sempre vissuto le due cose in modo distinto,solitamente se mi infatuivo di qualcuno mi rimbambivo talmente tanto che poi vedevo tutto rosa e non riuscivo ad innamorarmi perch incapace di percepire la realt e com'era effettivamente l'altra persona,poi quando mi risvegliavo dal bel sogno in cui ero tutta presa bene mi ritrovavo con una persona con cui mi accorgevo di non avere nulla con cui spartire quindi finiva tutto.Invece ad esempio nella storia attuale non mi sono per niente infatuata,ci frequentavamo,lui era innamorato pazzo fin dalla prima volta,io invece ho impiegato parecchio,l'ho conosciuto bene  e poi posso dire che mi sono proprio innamorata.L'amore e l'infatuazione sono due cose ben diverse,l'infatuazione  una cosa che ti crei tu nella tua mente e vedi l'altro come vorresti che fosse...l'amore invece  apprezzare l'altro come effettivamente  con i suoi pregi e difetti.L'infatuazione potrebbe diventare amore,ma non  detto...|`|cIU3Ns6xaa	si pu semplificare con una domanda..  riusciresti a vivere senza di lei?se no  amore, se si infatuazione.... poi ovviamento  pi complicato del previsto..|`|dl064mR3aa	l'amore viene dopo l'infatuazione..... un altro pianeta,fatto di complicit comprensione, e anche rinunce pur di vedere lei felice. baci|`|rgMVfDPWaa	difficile..lo puoi capire solo col tempo..l'infatuazione diventa a volte amore..tu conosvci una persona, te ne infaatui, credi di non potre veivere senza di lei..l'unica cosa da fare per capire se  amore o no.. beh..vedere come va..se col tempo non riesci proprio a rinunciare a lei allora  amore e sei fregato! e se vedi che sei pi distante, che il suo sorriso non  pi uno spettacolo e i suoi occhi non ti fanno pi naufragare in un mare di sensazioni..allora era solo infatuazione.divertente, ma nulla di pi, solo un bel ricordo..|`|b9b819a0102c536e7d6bc4efc83e0ffbaa	Solo il tempo te lo pu dire!

7733c4c608f8030b21dd1c6e1d384fa0aa	Ovviamente la soluzione migliore in una separazione  quella consenusale, perch  pi breve di quella giudiziale e anche forse meno indolore. Il mio personale consiglio  quello di riflettere insieme sui termini della separazione. Un altro consiglio  quello di rivolgervi non necessariamente ad un consulente matrimoniale, ma a qualcuno di cui vi fidate entrambi. Magari qualche vero amico comune che possa essere anche da arbitro. Qualcuno potr eccepire che l'amico non ha la preparazione necessaria per intervenire, ma ti assicuro che una coppia in crisi , lasciata da sola, pu produrre pi danni di quanto si possa pensare, perch i rancori, l'odio(come risvolto della stwessa medaglia dell'amore) , le incomprensioni , faranno esplodere le peggiori discussioni anche di fronte a questioni di poco conto. Un ultimo consiglio: meglio tegliarsi un dito subito per salvare la mano, che non tagliarsi tutta la mano dopo. Auguri|`|krb97SRdaa	anzi. rischi di pi. un accordo come quello che vuoi tu  pi facile da trovare in una consensuale. nella giudiziale il giudice assegnerebbe la casa per forza a solo uno dei coniugi.    abitare insieme per non credo proprio sia possibile. per i bambini nno ci dovrebbero essere problemi (poi dipende dal caso concreto) perch puoi chiedere l'affidamento congiunto con possibilit di vederli in pi giorni della settimana. il maggiorenne potrebbe anche benissimo decidere di venire a vivere con te|`|mqavbABYaa	Non ho capito molto bene la domanda.....

qd320iUuaa	E' un maschietto?? C' una spiegazione psicologica: si tratta del cosiddetto complesso di Edipo. Tutti i bambini (maschi) di quella et lo fanno.  un amore verso il genitore dell'altro sesso (fa un po' ridere, ma  provato dagli studi di Freud): il bambino continuer a stare cos attaccato alla madre finch non interverr la figura paterna a creare un distacco (anche con minacce: es. castrazione).  una cosa che  successa e succeder a tutti i maschietti fino a pi o meno 3anni; poi ci sar un progressivo e doloroso distacco.  un passaggio obbligato per la formazione del carattere del bambino: serve a creare il suo super-io,quello che gli dir cosa  giusto e cosa  sbagliato (la coscienza pi o meno).  A seconda che il padre sia una figura forte o meno il bambino svilupper un carattere pi o meno forte (e sapr o meno controllare le proprie azioni--> il super-io  una specie di censura). Comunque  tutto normale e la fine dell'attaccamento dipende da quando il padre si imporr per porre fine all'attaccamento del figlio.|`|9nXrMb2waa	Perche'  la persona che si prende cura amorevolmente di lui fin dalla nascita e soddisfa tutte le sue esigenze; con lei si sente sicuro e protetto, quindi allontanarsi da lei lo spaventa.|`|dee8618b9a0000a8d3194fb9152a4b68aa	Il legame con la mamma  qualcosa di profondo, nn a caso l'ha avuto in pancia 9 mesi!Cmq i bimbi si affezionano anke agli altri familiari, nn solo alla mamma!Ad esempio la mia nipotina esce pazza x me ed ha 2 anni!|`|84e0c1907751d910f5cd2f9af8f5061daa	perch la madre  il primo essere vivente ke gli mostra affetto e sicurezza dopo la nascita.. staccarsi da questa sicurezza  difficile... ma non impossibile!|`|ttPSSfD8aa	Ma Che Cavolo Di Domanda!

2nqJrotraa	Sono relativamente nuova su answers ma vedo che un sacco di ragazzi fanno domande su domande riferite all'amore, in cerca di una ricetta universale per fare cadere le donne ai propri piedi.    L'amore non  razionale, non esistono formule preconfezionate (per fortuna, se no, sarebbe una partita a The Sims).    Premettendo ci, parliamo di questa "CHIMICA". Non  un argomento da conoscere (al limite quella  la chimica che si studia a scuola), gi l'uso stesso del termine  controverso. Perch vedi, la Chimica (materia di studio)  una scienza esatta e razionale, mentre quello di cui si parla qui  quel qualcosa di illogico, irrazionale e inspiegabile, che ti fa scegliere una persona fra tutte le altre, che ti fa dire "io lo/a amo".    E' quella attrazione, quel qualcosa di indefinibile che pu, ad esempio, fare la differenza tra amore e amicizia. Mi spiego: io posso conoscere due uomini molto simili, dal punto di vista caratteriale, fisico e intellettuale, eppure uno solo fa scattare quella molla.    Credo venga usato il termine Chimica, preso dall'inglese Chemistry, in quanto la Chimica studia le reazioni (tra sostanze).    In effetti, alcuni scienziati hanno dimostrato che l'innamoramento spinge il corpo umano a produrre certi ormoni ecc... Ma si dibatte se queste reazioni alla vista dell'altra persona siano la conseguenza dell'innamoramento o la causa.    Comunque, l'amore  unico proprio perch non si pu spiegare. E, solitamente, arriva proprio quando uno non se lo aspetta, si rilassa e non ne  "ossessionato". L'altra persona infatti, se non  stupida, percepisce se viene vista come una "preda", una "conquista" e si chiude.    Spero di esserti stata utile e... Buona Pasqua!|`|7a4b4e8096fae73f1d7f6039681a1351aa	La chimica  un qualcosa che che si sente scattare dentro...io non te lo so spiegare....|`|eV99xXeAaa	sono un uomo,ma forse posso farti capire lo stesso.hai mai avvertito il desiderio irrefrenabile di baciare o saltare addosso ad una ragazza?quasi come se fosse una calamita.quella  la "chimica".quasi come la passione.se c' quella tra a te ed una ragazza...sei a cavallo!

E' la stanchezza di  tutta la giornata passata.  Anche se uno magari  studente non lavora ancora lo stesso sente questa stanchezza.  E come consequenza viene questa male di testa. questa male di testa +legata allo stress.  Magari aparte sentirti fisicamente stanco,c' qualcosa ke ti fatica mentalmente,o hai un pensiero ke ti da fastidio allora la stanchezza della giornata piu' questo stess ti fa avere mal di testa spesso.  L'anno scorso mi succedeva molto questa cosa visto ke avevo tanti esami piu' il mio rapporto con i miei era in crisis.  Allora per rilassarmi ballavo molto,cosi' anche per toglirmi questo stress, e anche per evitare il male di testa la notte.   ti consiglio di provare di capire se c'e qualcosa ke ti da fastidio mentalmente,di provare di risolverla o di trovare un modo di non pensare a questo problema.  Se invece ti capita di stancarti molto nella giornata prova di prendere ogni pomeriggio un bicchiere di redbull. E pure un altro consiglio:Magari se la sera  fai la doccia e ti lavi pure i capelli allora asicurati ke te li asciughi bene con il fone. Non bisogna mai dormire o stare la sera con i capelli bagnati ke fanno venire mal di testa spesso..   Ciao da Belladelmare|`|vjxAi71Aaa	Mai:-) ogni tanto capita di essere tanto stanchi, ma poi passa;)|`|IM4vCfRpaa	No, al massimo sono stanchissima e questa cosa devo dire che il mio ragazzo la rispetta... quando nota che sto cos mi abbraccia e mi tiene stretta e basta.

Loro s che "soffrono" di questo male oscuro. Naturalmente non tutte presentano questo problema. Dipende dalla loro voglia di fare o non fare sesso. Se non ne hanno voglia stai sicuro che in quel momento "hanno una forte emicrania"... quindi ti conviene girarti dall'altro lato e... e buona notte...

310788224e5ec133ac769e70a159ba65aa	Naturalissimo ma non solo in un rapporto d' amore, ma generalmente in tutti i contatti umani...La tensione d' anima e una cosa allucinante, e a volte puo influenzare i nostri rapporti con la gente...  Di solito, io cerco di non trasmettere le mie preoccupazioni o la mia tensione in un rapporto, l' altro non e responsabile di soffrire per me...  Figurati che quando io sto male anche fisicamente, non lo dico a nessuno, e preferisco soffrire sola, perche gli altri devono sapermi come mi hanno conosciuta...Sempre in forma...|`|IM4vCfRpaa	Certo che  normale... se una  molto stanca o molto nervosa... difficile che un gesto di affetto venga accolto come al solito...

310788224e5ec133ac769e70a159ba65aa	Eccitarti di un modo particolare,e sussurarti una cosa...fa parte del gioco, anche davanti agli altri, ma senza che gli altri se ne accorgano...  Ma davanti agli altri una donna deve comportarsi da signora onorando te(il tuo orgoglio di uomo)e il tuo nome.Perche l' orgoglio del maschio e fondamentale e sempre da rispettare.  Se apertamente fa cosi, prima si perde la magia dell intimita, e poi fa una bruttisisma figura agli altri che potrebbero considerarla come una persona leggera(anche se non lo e).  La seduzione di una donna, e sempre questa:Essere distante, signora,sapere controllare ogni gesto suo, spaere comportarsi come vera donna davanti agli altri, e dare se stessa nell intimita con il suo partner...  Eh, certi valori si devono mantenere, e certe cose si devono conservare per l' uomo che ama...Non compromettersi davanti ad ogniuno....|`|4bbe0bd13a65e1fcf581d1cd8fa17610aa	le prime volte che uscivo col mio lui una ragazza della compagnia mi ha chiesto se uscivo per fargli un cambio marcia ho risposto: " non ho la patente quindi non sapevo come si faceva" sono scoppiati tutti a ridere.

Da cosa lo noto?    - Dal fatto che anche se esce di casa per 1 ora mi manca  - Dal fatto che anche se vedo altri ragazzi, nn mi interessino     minimamente al di fuori del mio lui.   - Dal fatto che in una giornata, il mio pensiero fisso  lui  - Dal fatto che quando sono fra le sue braccia, sono la     ragazza pi felice del mondo.   - e da molte altre cose...    Quindi io sono convintissima di essere innamorata.     Spero che tutti possano trovare un amore come il mio, perch vi giuro che viverlo...  veramente speciale e stupendo.

Dipende dal luogo, dallo standard, da mille altri fattori!!   In Germania  prassi comune da decenni, solo che li si chiama 'Zimmer-frei' dai cartelli che vengono esposti dai proprietari per offrire ospitalit. In genere sono sistemazioni economiche, dove per 20-30 euro circa a persona si pernotta con una colazione spesso pantagruelica. Sono quindi pi economici degli albergi o pensioni, e molto pi caratteristici e ospitali.  Recentemente si sono fatti strada anche in Italia, col nome inglese, dato che ora 'fa trendy'. I prezzi credo siano un p pi alti che in Germania, e si aggirano sui circa 70-80 euro per due persone per locali in citt. Pi si va fuori pi il prezzo  abbordabile.  Attenzione, il 'bed and breakfast' negli USA pu essere costosissimo e costare anche ben oltre 200 o 250 dollari a notte!!|`|dc4d59f7248716eebcfd5739a1884069aa	dipende dove...poi posso darti sostanzialmente una mano, perch lavoro nel settore....

Io ho 26 anni e un figlio adesso non lo vorrei... anche perch non saprei come mantenerlo. Per ho due amiche sposate che hanno un figlio. Sono madri nate, i padri provvedono ai bisogni della famiglia... e stanno benissimo. Quindi come vedi non  che una a 26 anni sia troppo giovane... dipende dal tipo di persona e dalla situazione economica.|`|4d24966aa00c03814a39328434fe25d4aa	io l'ho fatto proprio a 26 anni e cosa devo dirti...non sono certo pentito anzi  la cosa pi bella che mi  capitata nella vita. Per pensandoci razionalmente oggi forse  un p presto...visto che ormai si  tutti mammoni che non si schiodano da casa fino ai 30 e passa anni. Comunque l'importante  farlo con la testa : a tuo figlio gli devi garantire un futuro ed una vita dignitosa.

Non ti conosco, quindi non posso risponderti se  giusto o meno per TE! C' gente ke anke a 50 anni dovrebbe rinunciare a farli i figli per quanto sono immaturi e invece ci sono persone ke a 20 anni hanno una maturit tale da poter crescere un figlio.

Ciao e auguri!!|`|920f91374ebb582b32255de6068ad68aaa	se puoi gi garantirgli amore e sicurezza (anche economica) non vedo dove possa essere il problema! il fatto  che oggi ci siamo abituati ad avere figli a 40 anni...ma questo non significa che sia giusto (io sono contraria alla figura del padre/nonno...). magari 50 anni fa a 26 anni ne avresti gi avuti 3 di figli!  invece di pensare soltanto al fatti che nella vita ci si vuole divertire e tr..bare come conigli, pensiamo anche al fatto che non sarebbe giusto che i nostri figli abbiano a che fare con dei genitori matusalemme!!|`|hd8fNS6Paa	Un figlio  una responsabilit inimmaginabile, oltre che un impegno che costa sacrifici sia economici che mentali. Ovviamente  anche una gioia enorme.   Secondo me avere un figlio non  una questione di et anagrafica. Bisogna sentirsela, essere consapevoli e soprattutto sapere che un bambino non  il bel bambolotto da tenere tra le braccia, ma  un essere vivente con tutte le sue esigenze.|`|D6IypUvlaa	no..non  una questione di et.. Per avere un figlio devi essere abbastanza maturo da diventare padre!! La stessa cosa vale per le donne...  AUGURI!|`|zlKmo5Fvaa	Se parli di giusta eta' biologica per concepire figli possibilmente sani, 26 anni e' piu' vicino al tardi che al presto. Se pensi alla societa', specialmente in Italia, e' presto dal punto di vista dell'indipendenza economica: moltissimi a 26 anni non hanno ne' un lavoro ne' una casa, infatti la media dell'eta' per avere il primo figlio si' e' alzata fino ai 29 anni.  In conclusione, dipende da caso a caso. C'e' gente che a 30 anni non e' ancora pronta, per ragioni psicologiche e contingenti e c'e' gente che a 25 anni e' gia' sposata e con piu' figli. L'importante e' fare scelte consapevoli nella vita. Ciao :)

I miei suoceri vivono da separati in casa da pi di 15 anni. Dormono in camere separate, ognuno cucina per s e non si rivolgono la parola se non per insultarsi.   Mio suocera (che  una strega!) se ne frega di questa situazione, perch mio suocero si  accollato tutte le spese di casa (mutuo, bollette, cibo, ecc.), mentre lei sperpera i soldi della pensione in cavolate! Mio suocero, invece, dice che ha cercato di tenere la famiglia unita per il bene dei figli. E, adesso che i figli sono grandi e indipendenti, dice che continua a sopportare questa situazione solo perch prova pena per lei e sa che se la buttasse fuori di casa, finirebbe sicuramente sotto un ponte a fare la barbona.   Io posso solo dirti che tutta questa storia ha influito negativamente sulla crescita di mio marito e di mio cognato che, appena hanno avuto l'opportunit, sono andati via di casa e non vogliono avere nessun rapporto con la madre. Mio suocero, dal canto suo, per comportarsi in questo modo, ha perso l'opportunit di rifarsi una vita con un'altra persona e, ancora oggi, si sente rinfacciare dai figli di averli fatti crescere con 2 genitori che si sono sempre fatti la guerra.   Non riesco a capire cosa spinga 2 persone a comportarsi in questo modo, ma se (spero mai) dovessi ritrovarmi a non andare pi d'accordo con mio marito, sarei la prima a scegliere di separarmi, soprattutto per il bene di nostro figlio.|`|NYKnt0tgaa	 durata poco... poi lui ha cominciato a non tornare pi a casa....(per fortuna)|`|uD1h14s4aa	leggendo la tua domanda mi sono sentito direttamente coinvolto, oltretutto ho in piedi una relazione con una donna sposata pi giovane di 15 anni totalmente diversa da mia moglie, il motivo che mi blocca nel separarmi  di natura economica, vviiamo con un solo stipendio di circa 1700 euroe un canone da pagare mensilmente mettendo nel conto che ho un figlio di 15 anni inoltre c un grande timore di restare solo.

In seguito, e' opportuno dividere o alternarsi (una volta lui, una volta lei) soprattutto se i due hanno disponibilita' economiche simili (entrambi lavorano, o entrambi studiano).|`|Qh3DA27paa	Il fatto che debba pagare sempre l' uomo credo che sia esclusivamente un retaggio di quando solo l' uomo lavorava e quindi aveva i soldi, mentre la donna stava a casa.  Molto dipende dalla situazione personale...se sono entrambi due studenti, credo che la cosa migliore sia che si paga met a testa (ovviamente in certe occasioni tipo San Valentino, anniversario,ecc...sarebbe carino che forse pagasse lui, ma non  ovviamente una regola). Se invece ad esempio lui ha uno stipendio e la ragazza magari ancora studia o  disoccupata o qualcosa di simile, se paga lui credo possa andare bene.  Nel caso contrario, cio che mi trovassi ad essere io studente e lei a lavorare, per devo ammettere che mi troverei in difficolt se volesse pagare lei e farei in modo di fare quanto meno sempre met a testa....ammetto che non  coerente con quanto scritto sopra, ma......per essere come sincero al 100% dovevo scrivere anche questa considerazione!|`|pL3PlETSaa	L'uomo!

AA11378038	You should not have to worry about kissing him, or how you you would know if he wants to kiss you. If it's meant to be it will come natural and just happen.

Heck, you could even ask him if he wouldn't mind if he kissed you. Just try. The worst thing that could happen is he would say no. And that means there are better, more awesome men you can be macking it with. And you should leave at that moment and find them.    I do not understand why women always wait for men to make the first move. Sometimes when they're put in that position, they won't make a move at all.|`|Zqo3lx1Taa	i was just like you the other day....  most guys i know dont like to make the first move. if you feel conforatble enough around him kiss him on the cheek.

I'm a 25 year old virgin and there is no way in hell that I would even want to lose my virginity to someone that has probably screwed 10+ guys in the same day.  First, change your attitude about yourself.  If those people are your friends and they aren't saying that you are unattractive, then I would listen to them.  The first thing a women looks for is confidence in yourself.  Get that and the women will be flocking to you.|`|SojG1cJTaa	A good prostitute is a pro at sex and can teach you everything in a few days.I was put with one when I was 12,but that's how it was done in the old days.|`|b6b1a5ba089898bc73e7081ef7703fb4aa	Go to a party, talk to some girls, take them up stairs and f_ck their little brains out. I've done it, well, had it done to me. We girls are just as horny as you guys, just try to get us into bed, we'll go if you play your cards right. And by the way, prostitutes are disgusting.|`|AA10254355	It is great that you are facing this issue and not just keeping it  to yourself.  But, my personal opinion is to do the ideal thing  and not hire a prostitute.      Being more virginal and innocent is normally more attractive to  women.  Cleanliness, purity, self-control and other godly virtues  are attractive to women.    Ideally, you should go for a girl that is very good intelligent.    Go to her family and let them know that you are going to take good   care of her.  Spend time at the library reading up on these   things.  Go to counselors.  Spiritual counselors are best, but go   to some kind of counselors is better than none.  It does not have   to be professional counselor.  Learn why marriage is sacred and  that there should be no sex outside of marriage.         If you cannot do that and have to try out loose women, then   consider this.  Most of these loose women do not know how to have   safe, clean, healthy sex.  They do not know how to keep from   transmitting disease.  Did you know that the incubation period for   HIV can be as much as two years?  So even if a loose woman has   checked herself for AIDs  in the past few months she may still   have the disease!  And you can catch HIV through the mouth.  A   prostitute might have bleeding gums!     Normally prostitution is illegal.  She may involve you in   homosexual swinger relations since she may have other men she has   sex with.  Or some other boyfriend she has could pick a fight with   you.  She may blackmail you for money.      Of course, some of these loose women are very sharp.  They can   really fool you.  They can really intrigue you.  But, this could   very well be a trap.  If you have to go after a woman like this   then proceed with the most extreme caution.  If she lies to you   and goes away, then let her go!  You don't want to go after her   and possibly getting emotionally involved.    Many of these loose women are addicted to drugs.  You don't want   drug addiction!  It may very well be that the only hope for   getting these women off of drugs is to get some kind of   institutionalization for as many years as it takes to be  absolutely certain they will never go back to drugs again.      And do these loose women know what real love is?  They can go   through the motions of sex, but they probably do not know what   real love is.  You may try to give them your love, but what kind   of gratitude can they show?  After going through the motions of   sex the glamor or the love is gone and then we are feeling like no   better than some kind of animal or dog.|`|68ae24c7200643f118b924e938fc1025aa	well it's ok I was 18 when i lost it and my boyfreind had just turned twenty and my freind is 23 and she is still a virgin anf my brother was 23 when it lost it we all loose it at different times.

You're not a virgin because you consider yourself "unattractive" but because of your own personal decision, live with it! Dont even bother with a prostitue, chances are she's had over 200 sexual partners if she's one of the "experienced" ones. That would mean that you're having sex with her, those 200+ people she's had, their sexual, partners and on an on. Find you a nice girl who likes AND ACCEPTS you for you, maybe if she likes you enough, and you want to, yall can do the do! Good luck, bud!|`|Asr2L0Ktaa	Continue being a virgin until you find someone you love and want to be with. If you have sex with a prositiute you could wind up with something you weren't prepared for. Protection only protects you from getting someone pregnant and even that sometimes fails....just be patient and wait. And don't be so hard on yourself about your looks. You need to be more confident.|`|54qnb7QAaa	Good looking, ugly, whatever!  You should have at least banged a drunk chick by now!  Get out of the house dude!  Because you haven't been focusing on pus**. you probabaly went to school and have a good job, right?  Now, go buy a plane ticket to Vegas, then find a decent room.  Look in the local phone book for escort services, call one.  It will cost you $300, but it's worth it!|`|a0888d6bbb0cd8071ac8e3fc77e636e8aa	Well coming from someone who was once in your shoes - don't do it! My girlfriend is on this site and she was browsing through these questions and saw yours and thought that I would be the perfect person to answer your question. Iam a 25 year old guy who just lost my virginity. Trust me it could get extremely difficult and depressing at times when it seems like everyone around you is having sex and you're not. Iam so glad I waited because this girl turned out to be perfect for me. Sex can cause lots of drama and STD's. If you're looking for a sex life then look for a serious relationship w/ someone because from what I hear  sex is so much better when you're w/ the one you truly love. You don't want to have sex just to have sex. Get my point?? If you have a hard time finding someone try online dating. If you think you are to unattractive then try to get yourself in shape cause when you are confident about the way you look the opposite sex can sense this. And if all else fails, try porn, lol. Well good luck and be careful!  Justin- age 25
950fbc0fdd07e3750d2b16c89dad0dc0aa	1. Someone who sees the best in you.     If you were lucky enough to grow up with healthy parents, you have experienced the feeling of having someone who has always looked at your good qualities. Many of us missed that experience. You will be a lucky person if you have found a mate who is always looking at your 'silver lining'. Too often today people are more than willing to judge you by your errors, not by your potential.     2. Someone who gives you the benefit of the doubt.     There are so many times in your life when you need that little edge, that little opportunity to take just that extra step. It can seem as if your efforts are going nowhere and although you want to keep moving forward, there are so many negatives staring you in the face. That person who knows things could go either way for you but takes that leap to believe you will make it is the person who is more valuable to you than gold.     3. Someone who watches over you.     You need a guardian angel who is there, waiting to catch you if you fall, ready to help you when you stumble, ready to pave the way for you when you cannot get moving. There are people who love you who do just that. There are people who do not make a big deal out of saving your bacon. Do you know who they are?     4. Someone to watch you back.     You never know these days who is waiting to catch you off guard, to make sure you don't do well, to sabotage your efforts. You like to think that people will rejoice when you     do well. Many don't. If someone 'has your back' and runs interference for you when you are trying to run the gauntlet through life, give that person a big 'thanks' plus lots of your attention.     5. The person who tells you we all make mistakes.     You hate to be around that judgemental, harsh person who reminds you, 'I told you so', when things so south. You don't need anyone else telling you what you already know. On the other hand there are people who just let you know that the only way any of us learn is through experience. When you have really ended up in the dumper and blew it, stay close to the one who knows that the person who hasn't done anything wrong hasn't done anything much.     6. The person who gives you advice from the heart, not from the head.     When the situation gets rough and some big decisions need to be made, it's fine to have people outline the pros and cons of a problem and give you 'head' answers. But if you need a nudge sometimes to tip the scales, you always listen to this person who knows you must do what will let you live with yourself and have self respect.     7. The person who won't be the 'yes man' who agrees with you     No one who loves you is going to give you the green light and tell you to let er rip if it's clearly going to be bad for you. It's sad that often you surround yourself with people who tell you what you want to hear. The one who loves you will tell you to get help for a drinking or drugging problem, to stop the extramarital affair, and to be a good and decent person.     8. Someone who tells you to knock back, smell the roses, and enjoy life part of the time.     If you are a person who is a real performer and doer, there are likely to be people around you who enjoy the fruits of your labor and want you to do even more. Sometimes you may even see yourself as only valuable when you are giving, doing, and performing. Listen to the person who tells you that life is short and you need breaks and some R&R. That is the person who is looking out for you and your health.     9. The one who smiles at you and means it.     The person who loves you looks at you with eyes that smile and mean it. Too many people give you that slick smile, that quick pat on the back, and then forget that you even exist.     The eyes are the windows of our soul and you can read into a person's smile if it is saying, 'You are a fine person and I want to be with you as long as possible'. Don't fall for any phony smile that attracts you off in another direction, only to leave you stranded and alone.     10. Someone who sees you as beautiful, inside and out.     You know you aren't perfect. There are only too many examples of you looking around and thinking that you have flaws and aren't like the people on television. The person who loves you sees you through eyes of acceptance with no conditions. As you gain a few pounds and your hair gets thin, the person who sees you as attractive, inviting, and appealing is the person who loves you all the way, no strings or demands.     Nowadays, it's really important to know who loves you. Everything in our society is throw away, and many people have carried that over into the most important relationships in their lives. Think hard and look carefully. People who love you , like comfortable clothes, are easy on the heart, mind, and soul.

w0lNzMn5aa	Non so cosa dirti perch ho abitato da sola durante gli studi, avevo un appartamento tutto per me e potevo studiare tranquillamente senza distrazioni. A parte questo, sono piuttosto misantropa di carattere e quindi non ho avuto problemi, in fondo meglio sola che male accompagnata, se la solitudine si faceva sentire c'erano i miei amici a tenermi compagnia, ed essendo vicina a casa ritornavo dai miei nei week-end.  Comunque hai ragione, la convivenza  difficile, anzi insormontabile ad un'eta che rappresenta il primo vero distacco dai genitori e dalla comoda ed accogliente casa natale. Una mia amica abitava con altre due ragazze (notare che l'appartamento  di propriet dei genitori, quindi ti lascio immaginare) ma aveva lo stesso problema, anzi doveva anche essere pesante con loro, dato che la casa era sua, ma dopo due mesi le ha cacciate entrambe, ormai la situazione era diventata intollerabile.  Cerca di dare tempo al tempo,  normale che quando si inizia a conoscersi scappano fuori incomprensioni e litigi, basta che ovviamente ci sia educazione, rispetto dei propri spazi e collaborazione. Ciao e in bocca al lupo per gli studi.|`|2a61337edd8f45a403d5a2c9b6dfbf27aa	dico che pure io in questi 4 anni ho cambiato...e cambier, l'importante  cmq il sapersi far rispettare mettendo anche dei paletti ma nn dei muri, cercare di essere anche comprensivo e sopportare quello che normalmente non faresti, rispettare per poter essere rispettato! credo questi siano gli anni pi belli della nostra vita da vivere con intensit e felicit cercando di non far pesare i piccoli screzzi casalinghi dovuti da coinquilini pi o meno civili, se riuscirai a vivere bene con loro si instaurer un bellissimo rapporto come tra sorelle e via dicendo con relativi bisticci ma anche e sopratutto momenti difficili ma che un adeguata comunicazione pu spazzare via come il vento con le foglie...ti auguro di trovare la serenit in casa al pi presto! baci da milano!

Comincia a baciargli il pube, poi con la lingua carezzagli lo scroto we l'asta fno al glande. pian piano prendilo tutto in bocca e immagina di masturbarlo con le labbra. Se vuoi, e se gli piace, prova a mordicchiarlo piano. Continua alternando rapidit e lentezza. ogni tanto alza lo sguardo e guardalo negli occhi. quando ti accorgi che sta per venire non scostarti. L'ideale sarebbe che tu raccogliessi il suo seme in bocca ma se ti fai schizzare in faccia  ugualmente ok.  Spero di essere stato sufficientemente chiaro e di non aver urtato la sensibilit di nessuno.  P.S. Comunque tieni presente che la pratica ti aiuter molto pi di una sterile descrizione scritta.|`|160a25a0bbb20e11c495383657d4a44daa	immagina di essere una neonata affamata e che invece della poppa della mamma hai a disposizione il popparuolo di pap!    ricordati che dopo ogni poppata  buona regola fare il ruttino!    ...buon appetito!
vvPL4f4Faa	It takes a level of emotional maturity to go from intimacy to friendship and some people do not have it. It's not your problem and you have nothing to apologize for.

Dovrai inoltre affrontare tutti i problemi che si pongono davanti alla vita di tutti i giorni: far quadrare il bilancio famigliare, programmare la spesa, farla, programmare cosa preparare per pranzo e cena, le vacanze, il tempo libero, gli svaghi etc. senza considerare se arriver uno o pi figli. Allora il tuo impegno diventer veramente molto pesante tanto che a volte, specialmente nei primi momenti, penserai di non farcela e dovrai rinunciare ancora di pi alla tua parte di vita per dedicarti alla tua famiglia.   Se ti senti pronta, la vita da sposata  certamente gratificante, ma se non ti senti pronta pu diventare una prigione. Quindi pensaci bene.|`|1927964967626a5e16c6a05529fdb2deaa	solo una pazza isterica pu consigliare alla sua amica di sposarsi....anche perch il matrimonio, al giorno d'oggi non ha pi molto valore|`|77ef17fce5d8f6df914e91c1524b8bc9aa	il matrimonio  una cosa bellissima se gli altri non se lo sono vissuto non devono mika dirti ke  una kosa sbagliata..o peggio ankora, non crederci...io anke se soffro d'amore ci credo nel matrimnoio. mia madre ha sofferto una vita con pap ma io nel mio matrimonio ci credo (xke voglio sposarmi un giorno)....  cmq per tutte le donne ke credono ke servono solo a fare i servizi.....mantenete vostro marito allora, sfatikate!!!!e lui faccia la domestika.  ogniuno in casa ha i propri compiti e la donna non vuol essere piu donna.  siamo nel 2007 non ci sono uomini ke non collaborano nelle pulizie.....mio padre faceva tutto, e mia madre non aveva piu il ruolo di mamma!!!!  essere la donna e avere il potere nell'ambiente casalingo  bellissimo.|`|8Ivx5Fbtaa	Perch sulla donna gravano le difficolt della coppia...il mantenere la serenit, l'economia domestica, i figli....

Una madre specialmente se di una certa et, ricorda bene che non c'era molta libert per le donne ai suoi tempi, ora invece si e certo ti vuole consigliare di goderti la vita, di farti le tue vacanze, di goderti le tue amicizie anche maschili, Soltanto 30 40 anni f era inpensabile in molte case.  A mia figlia consiglio le stesse cose, goditela la tua giovent, non avere fretta di accasarti convivi prima di sposarti e fallo solo se lo desideri veramente. Se basato sulla fiducia, un p di seriet e qualche sacrificio il matrimonio non  una cosa negativa,ma prima bisogna anche conoscere la vita e le persone.

Some guys are like real pigs and they just want to do it with a virgin so they can tell their buddies that he popped a virgin.  So becareful if you want to have sex with a real genuine guy.  You should wait and if he waits and doesn't get mad or upset then he could be a real nice guy but the ones who pushes you or threatened to break up with you are the ones that dont' care for you.

If she wants to stay home and read all his old emails, keep her company.  Even if you have a boyfriend, make sure you keep time available for girl time.  Go shopping or to the salon.  Encourage her and make sure that she knows she can call you at two in the morning when she's thinking about calling him because she's lonely and misses him, but she knows it's not a good idea.  You seem like a great friend... just make sure she knows that.|`|jPyX9WwNaa	You can't.  You can be there for her, you can do whatever she needs. But she is hurting inside and you can't do anything about that. She needs time to let her heart heal. But you being there for her helps along the process. You're obviously a good friend to want to help her, so stick with it. It will take some time. But eventually, she'll be alright.

Se mi guardo intorno non vedo altro che donne che affrontano la vita anche da sole , e molto spesso con un bambino , con grande energia e volont e dall'altra vedo dei "ragazzi" di 40 anni che hanno paura di allontanarsi dalla famiglia .    Ed allora , a malincuore ma cosciente di quello che dico , mi sto domandando anche io : ma la MIA RAZZA  davvero in fase di estinzione? IO credo di SI ! Viva le donne ... viva le belle donne ..... che sono le colonne  ... dell'Amor !! ( NdR Vecchia canzoncina ma che rimane sempre valida !)

c4add1bd7da1a048ce8929e9ba773ab5aa	Hi Olivia....Hun..this guy is bad news I'm afraid. You need someone else that has a better attitude. Apparently he doesn't care enough about you to even give you a 2 sec. phone call. Life isn't that busy believe me. This guy is a pure example of "Kiss and Tell" and leave her behind type of guy. Tell this guy that you are not interested since he can't find the time in his busy busy schedule to give you a call. That you have other fish in the sea that is interested in you. Don't be his puppet on a string for his beck and call. You can do better, believe me. Have a great day and good luck on your decision.|`|65549cbd3a6420fefed4b9ae61d7a154aa	Ignore him,he cant be that bothered about you or he would have been in touch,why sit at the back of the door for someone to contact you,as and when he pleases,you should be with somebody who wants to be with you,not just fit you in as he pleases-ive done it myself,sat there watching my phone etc,deleted the number,then when he called ,saved it again-learn to expect more because your worth more-good luck|`|c179f63936dad07fd9de076245c6e04eaa	walk away... you've started this one on the wrong foot... so step back... take a deep breath and count your losses... if he's really into you... he'll be back...OR have a sit down and discuss where you're coming from... either way... you both need to define some terms if you are intent on developing a relationship with each other...    You are early in this... so tell him... it feels like broken promises... when he tells you he'll call ...and doesn't... it created some confusion on your part...and even felt manipulated by it... on the ol' "go forward" tell him... you're not going to sit by the phone... and that you're making plans without him... If he can't make an effort  then why should you?|`|jQdkjNF8aa	Nothing. This guy plays too many games. He many be busy, but he should have the decency to tell you. He should have at least called you and said, "Hey, I'm really sorry. I've been busy." Something like that.|`|c1dea546d60c93b33fde44b04960c799aa	First off did you ever think that maybe he has actually been hmm... BUSY my X-gf used to do that crap. Then you say well you could have called or something look I work for 12 to 14 hours a day and still have to run around and do stuff I am busy.  It would have been different if you had sex then I could see your anger but  a kiss? are you serious A stripper will kiss you for free if she likes you and your spending some $ sometimes the will do more than that. The point being grow up and I hope he doesn't call you back that could have been your guy and you messed that all up.|`|c956eb17967d323763559ac1fae31075aa	what is the point of being with someone if the person doesn't have time for you? apparently he is always busy even if he calls it would be only for a day. if he wants to get to know u and be friends with you he is going to have to make time for u. personally if i were you i would just leave it alone and find myself another guy.
RsFxgN4Gaa	My children are not allowed to date until they are 16.

A date could be a few hours at the mall, a movie and a kiss, a sleep over, or a roll in the backseat of a car.   About the astrological sign, a good site to visit would be http://kamalkapoor.com/sun_signs/scorpio... But I strongly doubt that someone's astrological sign has an effect on their love life.

Non esiste un ragazzo intelligente, e lo dimostra il fatto che esistono ragazzi che tradiscono le proprie compagne (potrebbero lasciarle ) oppure che cmq devono sempre provarci con le ragazze per sentirsi uomini... non mi sembrano atteggiamenti veramente intelligenti...  per la gentilezza vale la stessa cosa dellasimpatia, guardati intorno...

D75HBm5Vaa	This is an interesting question. Well, you could approach it causally, like, 'ha, wouldn't it be cool if we were together' and see it he catches the bait. Or, you could tell him up front, and see how he takes, ask him how he feels, there's so many ways you could approach this...I say think it out a little bit more and find a way that will tell him that won't jeopardize the friendship...    Think about the outcome on both ends.    Stay Strong.|`|2y0mDt2Naa	Show don't tell. That goes for everything in life.     When you talk about something, it makes it less interesting. When you use action, that's when you'll get what you want.|`|AA12363243	you can't really tell him without looking lame or clingy.  just keep doing what you're doing and let it develop into something if it ever does.  just a bit of personal advice...guys from the past come around because they know it will be an easy lay.  he's probably not looking for anything serious|`|q5LDhlQGaa	awww....i dunno|`|AA11020866	Girl, don't do it! If he wants to be with you he will eventually say it. Sometimes when we let our feelings get involved we tend not to use our brains. Just continue to hang out with him and enjoy yourself. If you tell him you want to be with him you may scare him away.|`|s6miUiKSaa	You could tell him that you are really interested in him romantically and see if he feels the same way. If he does then bring up dating and mention your looking for a serious relationship.|`|c81c0e527a23673cab3e01a1e0500016aa	I'm going to refer to the guy you have the hots for as "guy  1" and the guy who you consider as being JUST a friend as "guy  2".    Now.  First of all, don't you think that it's a bit unfair to guy   2 to just string him along.  If you know that you no longer have any feelings left for him--let him know. Free him.  Give him a chance to find someone who's attracted to him, just like you're attracted to guy   1.    Even though the relationship is not committed on your behalf, guy  2, may not feel the same way.  So, only you would know the best way to break it off. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend breaking it off, just do it gently.    So that it won't come back and splatter in your face (little secrets always do that),  I think that you should tell guy  1, know about the other guy.  He has to understand that your world didn't stand still just because he left out of it.  Let him know that you did start seeing someone else, but after all of these years, he's still the one who holds your heart (I know that sounds a little cheezy).    So, instead of having the 3 of you possibly bumping into each other on the streets and a big fight possibly ensuing, be a woman and do the right thing. Let each man know what time it is.  As I said before, you wouldn't want to be strung along if the guy you had strong feelings for really had strong feelings for someone else. Would you?    Whatever you do--good luck!!!|`|CzofnDAEaa	uhhhh you just bring it up and you use words|`|Pg9Fshglaa	Just tell him. What is wrong with you girls today? Speak your damn minds.|`|ZAeycBQ1aa	Just tell him your ready and he will accept that.|`|7532035b5814c446a2ae6b23cc1f6519aa	Well just talk to him. Tell him that you've been feeling that the two of you should give it a try again and ask him how he felt. He'll tell you everything by the way he responds. If he's in he'll let you know he's in, if he's not then chalk it up to bad timing, let him know that when he's ready for you that he knows where to find you.    Good luck sweetie!|`|RUDfoDonaa	I think you should dump your boyfriend and go out with this guy!  Give it a whirl!|`|P6iR6Udyaa	This is a very sensitive issue. You approach him about it though. There is no feeling worse than being in love with someone and they not know it. Weigh your oprions, are you willing to risk your friendship for this love, is it that serious. Do you think he feels the same. Really, the only thing to do is to get it off your chest, whats the worst that could happen? He says no? Life is about risks.....take the leap and just do it.|`|Od2VFrDwaa	Just ask him were does he see things going between the two of you. Make sure you are ready for the answer.|`|z8lUrHAOaa	well i say one or the other. you cant have both. just do one thing. dont just do it for the thrill. the thrill is a hard thing to control. what i think tell it how you feel. dont hold back, it will only make things worse in the long run|`|lY7479FOaa	YES you should tell him definatly!!! i liked a guy forever and didnt tell him untill he moved away. Then he moved back here to live with me and now we have been together for like a year and a half. Just let him know that you want to be with in a way that you dont want to be with anyone else tell him you love him.
mpLVR5Gwaa	a nice juicy van|`|CVVayulfaa	Make her something, something she'll love. Or second option, buy her something she'll like.

My husband had flowers delivered to my classroom and I felt really special because everyone came to ooh and aah.  Next a great place to eat. Doesn't have to be expensive. Just bring a really nice birthday cake with you. THEN give her a $50,  100 ???? gift certificate to a really nice department store. Women love to shop and you would know that she likes what you got her because she picked it out herself..|`|Psl50ax5aa	She would probabally be happy with anything but I know the best thing i got for my birthday was a stuffed animal... They last they are cute and unless your gonna propose to her (thats actually the BEST birthday present i have gotten) then it can still say I LOVE YOU without nessecarally tying you down forever.  Hope this helps.|`|Dy1mpJOLaa	take her shopping.
vhdrviPCaa	It certainly appears that she likes you. I'm 90 percent certain that she does. However, it is possible she just sees you as a good friend.    She will not be offended if you ask her the following: "When it is okay with your parents, may I ask you for a date?" If she doesn't say 'yes" or if she gives you an evasive answer, then you will only be a friend and you should be nice and accept that.     If you prefer say, "I know you are not allowed to date, but will your parents allow me to visit you at your house?" Almost certainly they will, so if she indicates otherwise, then she is not interested and you should reply, "Then we will just be friends." That let's her know how you interperted her answer so, if she decides she likes you that way, she will find a way to tell you.|`|AA11929241	It sounds as if she does like you...and if you are really that interested, then you will just have to wait until she is 16. It's best not to get on the parents bad side. You can let her know how you feel, and if you are willing to wait...then make sure to  tell her that....I'm sure it will endear her to you even more.|`|b7d1a2b1e3d92300d36fee6e053a44aeaa	It appers that she does like you, you made me laugh about the whole straw thing very cute. Why not then just hang out at work as you have been doing so, maybe you can ask her out and if she says she can't till she is 16-17 then sugeest you guys have a talk with her parents and see if they will approve of you going to their house to watch movies and just hang out, at least you will be at there home and they have nothing to worry about, and wait till she turns 16  and then go out for real. They will respect you for respecting there wishes and you will be in the good books and you never know they may even give permission for you guys to go to a movie on your own without supervision. Good luck and have SAFE fun. :)|`|759a090e0dae57dd00fa9282d819bb4aaa	She deffinatly likes you. Ask her to hang out with you and some close friends instead of going by yourself. Good luck.|`|diWjcdM0aa	hmm, it's hard to say because she could just be friendly, but it seems like it..is she smiley and girly around other people too? or just you?  if so, there's your answer.    take one year to be friends with her, then ask her out when she's old enough...that's not too long|`|iVQMR84daa	uh why are you even asking this question man? Of course she does. She's probably just a little shy about it but I think you know the answer already.

Anch'io odio l'attesa e l'incapacit ad agire che l'accompagna.  L'ho superata molte volte e spero di avere la forza per superarla ancora. Perch nell'attesa vengono dei pensieri negativi e non si riesce a capire la vita che ci sta intorno.  Tutto sembra ridicolmente superficiale, non senti pi neanche gli stimoli  primari come il mangiare e il bere. La tua persona fisica  lontana dal pensiero che stai rincorrendo e ti opprime col suo stesso peso.  Ma stai sereno.....stalle vicino col tuo affetto.  Ciao|`|wWFhYucaaa	non la sopporto!|`|UsMV81iJaa	La odio, odio attendere!|`|cNhg3NBfaa	Ciao Livio,   "l'attesa di un piacere,  essa stessa un piacere"..  altrimenti..., si, l'attesa  "straziante"!|`|2bd45a49915957a1aa23b45071988bbdaa	Tutto  in relazione a cosa stai aspettando.O credi di aspettare.........ciao.......

Ti assicuro, non sono ormai pi e per nulla disturbato!   In questi casi non accetto il 'mal comune mezzo gaudio' non gli do la soddisfazione di essere turbato in modo che loro si consolino sapendo di non essere gli unici, in questo caso, ad essere 'mentalmente disturbati'!  Che se lo curino da soli il loro male!

gWTg0gGLaa	Tuk Nurul...    Keseriusan di dalam berhubungan (pacaran) bagi seorang cowok itu bukan hanya berkorban untuk sang pacar. Dan juga, bagi beberapa cowok sangat lah sulit untuk memperlihatkan bahwa dia benar" cinta & sayang kepada pacar nya hanya melalui pengorbanan.    Tidak semua cowok dapat memperlihatkan hal itu. Tidak semua cowok yang serius kepada ceweknya juga ingin berkorban. Hubungan kamu sudah berjalan. Jika tidak keberatan, langkah yang harus kamu lakukan adalah komunikasi.    Ungkapkan dengan pacar kamu, bahwa kamu membutuhkan "pembuktian" demi terpenuhinya keingintahuan kamu terhadap "keseriusan" cowok kamu. Utarakan & diskusikan dengan baik". Jika memang cowok kamu serius, pasti akan ditanggapi dengan baik pula.|`|ytTpsECvaa	Kalo tuh cowo ga rela berkorban mending putusin aja!!    Dia gak begitu cinta tuuh|`|avzYrwZXaa	Emang kamu udah berhubungan/pacaran sama dia berapa lama??    kalau kamu baru pacaran sama dia, mungkin kamu harus menahan diri untuk mengenal dia lebih dalam, siapa tau sifatnya kaya begitu sayang sih sayang tapi masah bodoh.    Tapi Kalau memang kamu udah pacaran lama sama dia, menurut gw itu cowok ga sayang sama kamu en manfaatin kamu aja, jadi mending kamu tinggalin aja.    Banyak kok cowok2 yang lain yang penuh perhatian en mau berkorban demi pacarnya ok.|`|5uWl1Ukaaa	berkorban dalam hal apa dulu? detailnya gimana? berat memang jika kamunya menuntut banyak berkorban dlm byk hal. berikan pengertian kpd dia jika kamu ingin sesuatu, dan km jg mesti berusaha utk mengerti. dia mau jalan sama kamu salah satu bukti jugakan klo dia bersedia menemanimu dan berkorban waktu. jika dia tdk perhatian mana mungkin mau jalan bareng kan?|`|NCzMLqveaa	ya llo tes ja  dgn cara lo.......good luck|`|1l7BnYRRaa	kalo banyak berkorban ntar jadi korban tuh cow.... apa kamu banyak berkorban sama dia? kalo kamu banyak berkorban ma dia tapi dia nggak mau berkorban ma kamu,, maka kamu yg jadi korban dan lebih baik putus... karena cinta itu penuh pengorbanan antara kedua belah pihak.|`|lI3W00MHaa	kL gw diposisi lo c, gw ptusin..  yg nmany co kL uda gk mw berkorban bwt qt, it tnda2 dy dah gk syg lg ma qt.. kcuaLi kL dy emg dasarnya pelit berkorban.  so, drpd mkan ati bwt kdpn, mending patah ati skrg truz dptin yg lebih baik..

c7yX2t9Eaa	innanzitutto calmati perch essere incazzati  non porta a nulla di buono;  meglio parlare e discutere a mente serena.  devi farle capire che passare la notte nella stessa casa del suo ex non aiuta al vostro rapporto di coppia;  come il conflitto d'interessi;  sono inutili tutte le possibili scuse: dovevamo parlare io e la nina..... eravamo chiuse nella sua camera.........ma tu non ti fidi di me.........NO!!             non si fa e basta!       totalmente antietico.   ricordale che scegliere di costruire un rapporto implica il dovere di rispettarsi reciprocamente e nel caso  rinunciare ad alcune situazioni come quella di stasera, altrimenti w i single.|`|qTXGZ0n3aa	attento che l'amica potrebbe essere solo una scusa per "pararsi" del fatto che si vuole aggirare dalle parti dell'ex...    le donne ADORANO perdere tempo con gli ex... se sono state lasciate vogliono dimostrargli che vivono benissimo lo stesso senza loro.. che si trovano alla svelta un ragazzo piu' figo e ricco..etc etc etc....    se hanno lasciato loro invece.... non cambia molto.. adorano vedere gli ex ancora innamorati e disperati sbavargli dietro... e "casualmente" gli passano vicino con fare "snob".....    se a te da fastidio quindi faglielo notare.... se la prendi come una mancanza di rispetto diglielo... se ti vuole bene evitera' di farlo ancora.... se non "considera" l'argomento minimamente.. beh e' evidente che forse ha ancora in mente l'ex e non ti rispetta come dovrebbe...|`|hnkf65Ceaa	il triangolo!

Sta a te ora reagire, ma qualcosa dovrai dirle, se non vuoi che diventi un'abitudine.|`|3LlPzTJtaa	ritorno di fiamma cn il suo ex??|`|FZqW6Akkaa	beh... hai ragione!! vacci anke te!!! senn spacca a lui se f qlks...

Bello, hai solo paura che lei ti possa tradire, capisci perch e risolvi il tuo problema, a limite lui potrebbe provarci con lei, che lo respingerebbe e te lo verrebbe a dire, quindi, ripeto, il problema  tuo.|`|zHtJzVgPaa	se sarei in te stasera stanotte o ora andrei  casa sua e digli che la vuoi|`|SbXruuXFaa	io mi incazzerei di bestia...  fai bene cmq... prova a parlarle...  o se la nina  veramente la tua migliore amica parla con lei e chiedile il perch, anche se per deve essere sincera...|`|6wZrhWVBaa	un rapporto se non si basa sulla fiducia  molto probabile che prima o poi crolli. Non ti preoccupare, lei in fondo  libera di stare con la sua amica e magari di rivedere il suo ex-ragazzo. Se il vostro  un rapporto sincero dovrai chiederle spiegazioni successivamente, se la cosa ti ha infastidito, e lei ti sapr rispondere altrettanto sinceramente.|`|0VZcdn6iaa	arrabbiarti non serve a nulla...cerca di avere fiducia in lei, in fin dei conti, ti ha detto che va dalla nina,si, ma non pensare subito alle cose pi sudicie!!! ogni tanto anche noi abbiamo bisogno di stare con le nostre amiche e anche se dividono casa con il nostro ex-ragazzo, questo non vuol dire che ci fanno da copertura perch lo vogliamo rivedere, solo che vogliamo stare con la nostra amica!!! abbi fiducia!!!|`|wWFhYucaaa	fatti un bel bagno caldo co sciolto nell'acqua un chilo di sale grosso, rilassati e fregatene!|`|z1VOQR1raa	Fai bene ad essere arrabbiato,  normale che tua sia un p geloso della situazione che si  creata!

nWwBxciRaa	yes it is|`|AeAwgUE8aa	If your standards are not that high, then its pretty easy for anyone to find a partner.     Don't be in a hurry, ok? Don't rush off and grab unto the first thing that walks past you in a skirt. You are a handsome fellow. If I were a 20 year old white girl, I'd date you!|`|0ekUBvbOaa	Uh... no...
AA11019300	He doesn't want to date you, he wants to convert you and add you to his list of converted people so his buddies will be impressed.  Don't fall for it.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	Missionaries are taught to convert people like CEO's so its best to just brake it off and run, they are thinking only of converting you and if he gets romaniticallty involved with you, they will send Him home.|`|AA10637643	If he's 5 years older than you, you must be around 14 -17.     1 You are too young for a serious relationship   2 He is not out there looking for a relationship   3 It is very common for those being taught to feel close to the missionary because they are helping make their life better, so it's easy to confuse that with attraction    Don't worry about him, be his friend, continue with the discussions if you want, and let him finish his mission.|`|CZYXO1NFaa	You have to do a little work here, and it wont be easy, but in the end you will be a lot happier.    The way I see it, you have to separate the two things you are feeling. One, a huge crush on the missionary who is teaching you, and two, your feelings for what you are being taught.    First, its not the right time or place for him to have a relationship, nor is it good for you to fall for a missionary. There is nothing wrong or bad about what you feel, it actually occurs quite often, but it can only really lead to heartbreak. He is not out there to meet girls and fall in love, but he also, I'm sure, wouldn't want to hurt you. There is always the adage of maybe sometime, some where, some how it will happen, but in reality you will have plenty of other crushes and loves that will be legitimate and good for you. Let go of this one and you will be A LOT better off in the end.    Second, sooner or later he will be gone and what you will be left with are just your feelings for what you have been talking about with the missionaries. You are learning things that ask you to make some big decisions and sometimes changes. Its important to take them very seriously and not be clouded by a crush or love for some boy. I promise that he wouldn't want you to pursue this crush, but instead focus on making the best decision for you and your life by being clear headed with all of this.    Now doing this is the hard part. From the sounds of how the missionaries responded to your concerns...I don't think they really understand what the problem is. You need to really voice your concerns. I know it is easier said than done, but trust me...if they really care then they will find a way to work everything out so that everyone is happy and you don't have to deal with these strong feelings anymore.|`|AA10752795	Do nothing.  Do not join the church for the wrong reasons.  Do not get your hopes up about a romantic relationship.  Do not bother trying to continue any relationship with him until after his mission.   Do not get up set by this situation as you will be over him shortly.|`|buHqYq2haa	Stop seeing the missionaries if you aren't interested in what they are teaching. If you aren't interested in their message, please, please, please don't waste their time.     If the missionary is 5 years older than you, that makes you about 13-15 years old. You are young! Focus on school and friends.|`|hKyVSBjmaa	Missonarys have to do their work don't be the reason he gets sent home. Just let him know that you like him and maybe when he goes home he'll get in contact with you. But it sounds like a school girl crush and you'll get over him no problem.
ZNd4N1wtaa	Haha.  wow.  talk about giving a first impression.  Maybe it was just a mistake and he didn't mean to do it...just like girls can't fart on a date...cuz its disgusting,  same thing,  don't give up on him he was probably just scared outta his mind :)      help?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|o9mJFzitaa	He was probably drooling over your good looks ;)|`|pwyzh7XPaa	BECAUSE YOU ARE HOT!!!!!!!!!!|`|rnEu4ktTaa	he might have alot of spit or was thinkin of makin out and was all yummy! lol. idk|`|TPcb09bUaa	eww i would be really grossed out i probably wouldnt want to kiss him again but thats just me|`|3NPa6Ytdaa	Yeuw! I guess he could have been nervous???  Maybe you shoud give him another chance...if he does it again then it's just the way he is and you need to decide whether or not you can cope with that.  If he doesn't do it again you're onto a winner!|`|yU9meawJaa	thats disgusting! how did you even kiss him after that? i say find a new good looking guy who doesnt slobber on himself|`|14232f88129837f55a4e75f2ac9a9dd0aa	That is just gross i have never heard of that before|`|zDgfMFv6aa	aww lol.

Most likely a honest mistake!|`|DLSMg3qvaa	you must be really hott.|`|qv25Q4aaaa	he was just in the mood for the kiss    some guys, when they know theyre getting a kiss, they do have a little excess saliva    i guess his just kinda... came out of his mouth a bit lol|`|nMblGvE3aa	i'm sorry that's just too funny, but it was probably just a one time thing|`|SvX0VjvBaa	he gots da hots 4 u|`|KNIethLSaa	Sounds embarrasing, but if you like the guy maybe he was just nervous, give him a second chance.

rWRk8zSUaa	First of all, DO NOT go to the movies on your first date.  Second, when you start a date that late, it makes it seem like you're trying to get her to come back you your place afterwards which is not a good impression to leave.  If you are going to go with 10:30, meet her there so she won't think you have alterior motives.  Yes, you should buy her ticket if you asked her out and even if you didn't, it's a nice gesture for the first date.      You might be able to get away with Ihop or Dennys ONLY because those 2 will probably be the only places open, but in my opinion, if those are your only 2 options, then you should save dinner for another time.  As for her being tired, she says she's an insomniac, but you should probably be prepared to take a rain check in case she says she is.    Good luck.|`|RjrI1fbcaa	perfect time. and if its a date, your paying for movies at least. i hop sounds unnesscary. and pick her up. rin the doorbell and all. be a gentleman, not a nice guy/tool.|`|kMs7JU9waa	Yeah, the time's fine. Ask her if its good though, if she wouldnt be too tired. I think you should pick her up and go to denny's/i-hop after. And for the paying, offer to, but if she's willing to, let her pay for her own.  Good Luck!|`|hfjxIxojaa	My mom always said if you ask someone on a date then your should pay and if they did the same then they should. Personally, I think that a guy should offer to pick her up and pay for the first date and the woman should offer to pay for herself and regardless always say thank you! I think a good time for a "late date" is 8 or 8:30 so you can go eat,movies, then GO HOME. You don't want to go too late because you don't want sex to be in the picture at this point.|`|BHu9I7B0aa	well, if she isn't sleeping, and that's the time your free, then might as well go out.    1. ask her what is easier for her. offer a ride, but I think either should fine.  2. Pay. no if's and's or but's. I mean, jeez. it's the first time, be a gentleman.  3. Ask her. :)  4. once again, ask her. she might not be hungry afterward or she might be like me, and get strange cravings for fast food at night. ya never know.  5. same answer as number 2.      If 10.30 doesn't work for her, just ask her when she is free. be flexible and considerate of her. She'll appreciate it.    just a pointer..dinner and a movie is the typical date. If you really want to be different and special, do something different and special. It doesn't need to be expensive, just thoughtful.|`|wlvKveAXaa	Start earlyer and have the date be long!|`|8qfQkJQiaa	First of all if its not a good time she will tell you... and if your asking her out ofcourse you should pay!! Id do a movie then ihop...|`|SvX0VjvBaa	na. that would be a perfect time...|`|LfcnAx4Eaa	if your pissed off about paying then your not ready for a date. Sorry, but thats just being considerate. The time should be between you two, if shes fine with it then go for it. Dennys or Ihop is a kind of funny, but then again my first date with my boyfirend was at ihop and I was with him for 2 years. But you need to get over the whole paying thing. If shes cool then shell be fine with spliting the bill or something, but your fist action should be willing to pay.|`|5ff08e116c80bbc7ffbbdca7d0233c08aa	Well, if you are both night owls then that's a good time. Yes, you should at least offer to pick her up. I'm not going to say that you HAVE to pay for everything she might pay for something BUT be prepared to pay the tab everywhere.    Depending on your city if i-hop or denny's are the only places available go for it. But if there is a place with a little more character to it, lights a little more dim GO THERE!

pxQLv1zqaa	L'Amore  essenzialmente una convenzione per identificare ci che tiene unita una coppia.  La maggior parte delle volte le persone confondono l'amore con l'innamoramento, che  lo stato di grazia iniziale dell'unione fra due persone. L'innamoramento (scientificamente dimostrato!)  una forma di alterazione delle percezioni, ed  come se il nostro cervello fosse drogato (nel vero senso del termine) perch si liberano delle sostanze che ci fanno stare bene (serotonina ecc...).  Fortunatamente (o purtroppo?) questa cosa finisce dopo un po' e si torna con i piedi per terra... ed il nostro corpo produce l'ossitocina che  una sostanza che stimola l'affetto verso una persona.  Quindi si pu dire che l'Amore  una somma di sentimenti che si provano tutti insieme e contemporaneamente nei confronti del partner.  Fra questi sentimenti c' l'attrazione fisica (passione), la stima, il rispetto, l'altruismo, la lealt, la fedelt, la comprensione, la complicit,  l'intimit.|`|dcb88358944f2c16dd350ef3a90a3a38aa	..una bella bottiglia di Bardolino davanti, e l'amore arriva per tutti! ;)) |`|nyFXgOcYaa	SEINCERIT E RISPETTO RECIPROCO...  |`|omMFFhXsaa	fiducia, rispetto reciproco e....amore per me  completarsi a vicenda|`|2a61337edd8f45a403d5a2c9b6dfbf27aa	bella domanda...cmq l'amore esiste...l'amore  forte..provarlo nn  facile...trovarlo ancora di meno...l'unico problema  dover farlo cessare...quando  lo provi non ti viene voglia di provare altro...quello ti basta e di quello vivi...quando ti manca ti crolla il mondo|`|G93C0AWIaa	per me l amore  l unica cosa ke mi permette di vivere... come l ossigeno..senza nn si puo definire vita la vita! come si fa a essere felici senza l amore..senza quelle emozioni strane ke provi dentro...senza quei brivi...pianti e sorrisi....cosa sarebbe una mamma senza un bambino?..una ragazza senza il suo angioletto?.... vero ormai nel mondo c e gente a cui nn interessa l amore..tanto ce il sesso ....ma secondo me in ogni piccolo angolino della terra ce un pizzico di affetto ke ogni tanto colpisce qualcuno..... e di li a poco nasce l'amore.... ce ki si nasconde dietro la masckera del sesso xke ha paura di soffrire...ma ragazzi si soffre sl xke si ama! gettate via la maskera xke dire e essere detti TI AMO  la cosa PIU BELLA ke esista! ...credetemi...|`|C6MQHWMxaa	spesso con il passare degli anni si cerca,se non la si ha, qulla che tu kiami soddisfazione fisica ,ma non solo! la'more  qualcosa di indefinito!|`|P3n5a7pQaa	  vero ke questo mondo  marcio, ma se sping i tuoi occhi altrove troverai chi ti amer per sempre affidandovi ognuno all'altro volando insieme verso il mondo nuovo...

Qhsf70O9aa	Saya turut simpati atas kejadian yang menimpa diri anda, semoga anda sabar dan tabah menjalaninya.    Cara menghilangkan perasaan hati yang luka :    1. Pikirkan dan catat semua kejelekan dan keburukan mantan suami.     2. Buat suatu khayalan atau ilusi bahwa karena keburukannya itu, kamulah yang menyakiti suamimu.    3. Kemudian ilusikan suami mu jadi sakit hati sama kamu.    4. Bayangkan kamu akan hidup bahagia tanpa suami yang pernah menyakitimu itu.    5. Renungkan apabila hubunganmu tetap dilanjutkan maka masa depanmu akan menjadi suram, dan mengalami kesusahan.    6. Senangkan hati karena kamu dapat pengalaman hidup yang sangat berharga / hikmah untuk kehidupan di masa mendatang.    7. Curhat dan tumpahkan seluruh perasaan dan kesedihan kepada sahabat, lepaskan seluruh masalahmu.     8. Bersenang-senanglah, dengan anggota keluargamu dan teman-temanmu.    9. Cari dan tekuni hobi yang baru, lakukanlah aktivitas yang positif, jangan beri waktu pada dirimu untuk mengingat kembali kegagalan rumah tanggamu yang lalu.     10. Jangan hubungi mantan suami mu lagi, baik lewat telpon, SMS ataupun e-mail, sebaliknya abaikan juga semua telpon, SMS dan e-mail darinya.    11. Jika perlu buang barang yang khusus yang mengingatkanmu pada mantan suamimu.     12. Memang bukan saat yang tepat untuk kembali membina hubungan yang baru, namun tidak ada salahnya untuk membuka kembali hatimu untuk orang baru, mungkin saja akan ada orang yang dapat mencintai mu secara lebih pantas.     Demikian ya, banyak beribadah dan berdoa.  |`|qT1WNMxgaa	1. Tindakan memaafkan  2. Konseling dengan ahli (misalnya psikolog)  3. Doa  4.

That sucks !!!  Everyone has to get married... After all happiness is not the only thing in life !!!! |`|Ea6TnOuOaa	Your question stirs the thought process in the reader's mind.  Very good question.  I don't think to live a life of your own, you should essentially have a spouse.  By and large, people are tempted to marry more for a reason of sex than the need for a partner to share life with.  Sex urge is so potential that it predominantly overrides your all other need and you end up giving it all the priority. It is an undeniable fact that one can ever conquer over sex and eliminate it from one's life for ever.  It is one of the basic inherent needs of ones life.  If the sex quotient is drawn out from the life of a married couple, they will find the very objective and cohesive element missing between them.   Marriage devoid of sex remains to be only intangible shackles.  Sex only binds them together but also it spices up the relations between them.  Life without sex becomes drab hence the people seek to make it lively through an arrangement called Marriage.  
IysGGnivaa	Hi,    welcome !  @Gwen dalam kategori ini della sampaikan   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  della melihat begitu bagus opini yang masuk menjawab pertanyaan resah @Gwen.  baru saja della menutup sebuah konten yg menarik  tentang '' Apakah menyimpan RAHASIA itu HARUS !  ''  jawaban yg masuk sangat menakjubkan, sebab didalamnya berisi ide- pendapat-dan pengalaman hidup user ttg pertanyaan della diatas.  nah!  pertanyaan saya '' serupa dengan pertanyaan masalah @Gwen ''    @Gwen sahabat baruku yang manis dan kini sedang resah,  tenangkanlah pikiran dan bantulah dengan doa apapun kepercayaan anda.  sebab dengan doa pada umumnya banyak membantu memberi ketenangan.  @Gwen,  dalam hidup kita didunia ini pasti dan so pasti kita akan mempunyai RAHASIA dalam hidup.  entah itu kita akan membukanya pada patner kita, karena kita mau kita selalu jujur dan terbuka apapun yg terjadi atau lebih baik kita kubur dalam-dalam demi mempertimbangkan sebuah kepentingan.  mungkin kalau dilihat sepintas, wuah !  betapa kita sangat ego melakukan hal yg demikian.  dan mengapa kita koq tega membohongi tunangan kita yg sangat kita kasihi !    akhirnya dear karena @Gwen percaya bahwa cinta kasih akan lebih kuat dari apapun rahasia, maka berceritalah anda tentang pertemuan itu.  akh! my dear @Gwen, menurut saya anda TIDAK BERSALAH  juga tunangan TIDAK SALAH.  yang ada hanyalah tunangan @Gwen TIDAK SIAP dengan situasi ini.  wajar hatinya terluka meski dia sangat mencintai @Gwen.  marilah  my dear @Gwen, kita meneliti mengapa tunangan sampai demikian tersinggung dan sakit hati.    >>  pada dasarnya kita manusia tidak rela kepercayaan kita hilang.   kita ingin kepercayaan yang kita titipkan pada seseorang berharga penuh dan tidak berkurang.    saya menduga dear, yg membuat tunangan anda menjadi demikian adalah karena @Gwen ''  bertemu berturut-turut sampai 2 kali dengan mantan tanpa terlebih dahulu mengadakan komunikasi dengan tunangan.    kalau saja diwaktu pertemuan pertama anda sudah menceritakan hal ini pada tunangan, saya kira hal yang kedua anda tentu akan menceritakannya kembali of anda tidak akan mendapat izin darinya untuk melakukan pertemuan yg kedua kali.  hal ini logis dear @Gwen    menurut della apa yg ada dalam pikiran sang tunangan adalah '' koq bisa sampai melakukan pertemuan sampai 2 kali, mungkin nanti ada ke 3 kali dst dst ''.  kita jangan melupakan my dear, pikiran insan dan perasaan akan berbeda dengan apa yg kita pikir dan rasa, sekalipun itu tunangan kita sendiri.  mungkin bagi kita pertemuan itu just silahturahmi,  tetapi tidak untuk pemikiran tunangan anda, dia akan menarik dan menarik kesimpulan cerita sendiri sampai dia menjadi terbakar sendiri dan akhirnya dia ngamuk seperti itu.  dan meskipun @Gwen sudah ''  bersumpah demi nama Tuhan '' tidak ada perasaan apa-2 dengan mantan dan tidak melakukan apa-2 dengannya.    namun @Gwen yang budiman ditempat,  sekali lagi dear   ''  kepercayaan dia pada anda  dalam hatinya kini bernilai berubah - berkurang ''  della berbicara sejujurnya dear untukmu ,  saya tidak mau menulis untuk menghibur, saya ingin berkata yg sebenarnya sebagai manusia lawan manusia.    nah! kini relasi pertunangan kalian menjadi goyah karena   ''  berkurangnya rasa kepercayaan ''.    apa yg @Gwen tulis benar- 100% benar,  bahwa biarpun kalian masih saling mencintai tetapi relasi ini sudah berjalan terseok-seok. maka tidak heran kini @Gwen merasa letih - capek dan hopeless  karena anda merasa '' tidak bersalah - jujur tetapi koq ternyata berjalan lain dari apa yang diharapkan  ''.    mba @Della memberi advis ;    >>>  ini merupakan satu-satunya cara bagaimana kalian menyelamatkan hubungan pertunangan ini     seperti yang tunangan katakan bahwa ''  kalian masih tetap mau terus ''  nah!  berbicara secara terus terang pada tunangan,  kalau kita mau terus maka please berikanlah sepenuhnya kepercayaan kembali, sehingga anda berjalan dengan mantap hati dan tidak bimbang  anda bisa akan bertemu kembali dengan mantan dimanapun saja.  anda tidak bisa menyembunyikan diri dan menghindar kalau berpapasan ditengah jalan.    sebagai manusia kita tidak akan luput dari kesalahan, justru dari kesalahan kita mendapat pengalaman untuk memperbaiki.  anda hanya seorang manusia dan tunanganpun demikian.    kalau kalian sudah sulit untuk memaafkan kesalahan baik itu prinsipil atau tidak, bagaimana kalian akan melangkah kedalam jenjang pernikahan ?

Tindakan kamu sudah benar untuk meminta maaf........ dan kamu jangan diambil hati kalau doi masih sering mengungkit masalah tersebut, karena buat kami laki-laki itu adalah hal yang paling menyakitkan kalau masih berhubungan dengan mantan2 pacar yang lama apalagi sampai pergi jalan2 walaupun positve.    Laki-laki sebenarnya lebih egois dari perempuan say.    Coba kamu bersabar dulu dan memberi waktu ke doi untuk bisa melupakan masalah tersebut, kalau udah mulai ngga diungkit kembali dan suasana lagi enak coba kamu berbicara dari hati ke hati dengan kedewasaan bahwa : Kamu sangat bersalah dan itu merupakan tindakan yang paling bodoh dan kamu berjanji tidak akan melakukan lagi.......    Jika sudah aman kembali hubungan kalian dan mantan kamu pengin ketemu kamu lagi, harus dipertimbangkan masak2. Kalaupun masih ketemu jangan sekali-kali ketahuan doi. Atau kalau mau aman jangan pernah ketemu dulu. Nanti kalau kalian udah nikah baru bisa ketemu semua sama-sama.    Masa pacaran memang adalah masa yang paling riskan, kamu harus hati2.    Saran terakhir : Coba kamu pelajari sifat2 kaum pria.    oke, semoga bermanfaat dan selamat mencoba|`|Z9w5Kv8Maa	sptnya kamu belum kenal betul ma tunanganmu ya,  kenalilah lebih baik lagi, mumpung belum sampe nikah,  seiring makin dewasanya sikap seseorang, pasti akan ada perubahan.  kalo ada kesempatan, coba tanyakan ke dia, berapakali lagi kamu hrs minta maaf, dan apakah tulus maaf yg dia berikan?  kalo di marah2 lagi.....ya udah.....gudbay aja.

Kadang laki-laki merasa hal-hal yang dilakukan adalah wajar meski sesungguhnya itu menyakiti pasangannya. Jika anda pergi rame2 bersama teman lain mungkin lain permasalahannya. Cobalah duduk berdua bahas sampai tuntas dengan kepala dingin dan yakinkan bahwa saat ini dan mendatang hanya ada dia di hati anda. Rintangan ini belum seberapa dibanding kehidupan nantinya, tegarlah! Perpisahan bukan jalan satu-satunya|`|nQXGC9Soaa	kesalahan kamu dg membuka diri berdekatan kembali dg mantan adalah memang sebuah kekeliruan, apalagi sampe nonton dan makan. doi akan merasa diselingkuhi..    minta maaf itu jalan terbaik. tetapi harus dilihat apakah doi mau memaafkan apa tidak. kalau doi masih suka mengungkit masalah itu, berarti sebetulnya doi belum tulus memberi maaf. hal ini akan terus menjadi kendala saat nanti mengarungi bahtera rumahtangga..    sebaiknya buat komitmen kembali. kalau mau terus, berarti doi harus tulus memberi maaf, dan kamu ngga akan mengulangi.     rasa cinta seharusnya bisa membuat doi tulus memberi maaf. kalo ngga berarti bukan lagi cinta..|`|o8lLSfcFaa	Gwen emang laki2 suka begitu  kasus gw juga ga beda2 jauh seh  cuma masalahnya yg aga beda    anyway, pada akhirnya semuanya clear setelah kita omongin baik2 semuanya dari hati ke hati  gw bilang apa yg gw mao, dia juga bilang apa yg dia mao  ya, mang harus dibicarain, klo gak yg ga penting jadi duri dlm kulit  biasanya walau yg salah mungkin loe, tapi cara sikap pasangan menanggapi masalah terus menerus berlarut2, pada akhirnya jadi hal yg bikin loe juga berbalik marah ke pasangan loe  karena lama kelamaan loe akan berpikir kalo loe ga deserve diperlakukan sedemikian secara loe udah coba ngeredam semua pertengkaran dan coba mengalah dengan egonya   mang berat sih maafin tapi mo gimana lagi  yang jelas setelah saling mencaci maki n ngomongin uneg2  gw cuma tanya lanjutannya mao gimana  klo mo terus ya loe bilang yg udh lewat jgn diungkit2 lagi  kalo ke depannya msh diungkit2 putusin aja deh  cape..|`|wqcvyXuYaa	aq pernah ada di posisi tunangan kamu, dan rasanya gak enak banget  ditusuk dari belakang. km hrs tau dan ngerti posisi dia, gak gampang ngelupain masalah org ke-3 walaupun km gk bniat gitu..  karena disini km yg salah, jd cobalah bersikap manis kpd dia. seiring berjalan waktu, mgkn perasaan dia gak dingin lg. dan kamu harus tau, posisi kalian sudah tunangan, jd cobalah manjaga perasaan masing2, hindari orang ke3, itu cuma memperburuk keadaan aja.  yg jelas dia cinta ngt ma km dan gak mau kehilangan kamu, wajar aja dia begitu, itukarena rasa sayangnya sm km.  waktu akan membuat hub kalian kembali baik.  ok...|`|gGLB6bT5aa	oh.. kasihan sekali... tersiksa sekali bathin ini..    Tenang saja.. itulah cobaan yg di berikan dalam menjajal cinta kalian berdua...  kalau kalian berdua berhasil melewatinya, maka masa masuk ke perkawinan, kalian akan lebih mantap dan lebih dewasa lagi..    Tunangan anda cemburu dan perasaannya menjadi galau.. takut kamu kembali lagi ke mantan kamu... karena dia merasa dikhianati.. itu perasaan dia..   berhubung tunangan anda masih belum dewasa banget,,, dan belum pengalaman banget,, maka reaksinya adalah cembetut terus.. yg kamu katakan dingin itu...    Tenang aja.. untuk mengatasi masalah seperti ini jagonya cewek...     lu kan dah minta maaf ..dan lu bilang masih cinta ama tunangan lu dan begitu juga sebaliknya...      Yang lu harus lakukan bukan hanya di kata2 yg keluar dari mulut saja :  1. Hapus semua no hp, telp, dan alamat di hp lu, buku diari lu, di mana saja deh.. gak ada nama mantan lu lagi.  2. Lu tingkatkan perhatian kepada tunangan lu seperti sering telepon dia.. tanya dah makan siang.. malam dan kerjaannya bagaimana?   walaupun biasa dia yg lakukan duluan.. sekarang lu yg lakukan dulu..  3. Lu kalau ada waktu , undang ke rumah , lu buatkan makanan khusus untuknya...  4. Lu jalan keluar dengan tunangan lu dan lu cerita ttg hubungan lu dgn nya, tentunya cerita yg asyik tentang kalian berdua,, dan tentang harapan lu kepadanya...  5. Lu tampil ceria deh... senyum dan manja di depannya...  6. Lu sering sms kepadanya, posisi lu dimana dan sama siapa.. walaupun dia gak minta..  contoh :" mas,, g lagi makan siang loh ama si fitri , yg bawel itu.. lg makan baso loncat... mas mau gak ??"  " Mas,, g lg bareng nyokap di mall, kerja yg rajin ya...kangen deh ama mas ""  " Mas, g lagi ke mushola dl ya... g doain kerjaan mas lancar.. biar kita cepat kawin..."  7. Jangan jawab sms atau telp dari mantan lu di depannya.. delete semua sms dari mantan lu... dan kurangi menerima atau menelepon cowok lain sewaktu kamu bersamanya... kalau kamu harus mengangkat telepon dari cowok lain, sebaiknya kamu melibatkan namanya dalam percakapan kalian dan batasi pembicaraan, singkat saja.. lu bisa telepon lagi setelah gak bersamanya..  contoh.." iya.. g lagi sama cowok gue , makan bakso .." g lg jalan ama co g ke salon" ...    Lu lakukan itu tanpa pamrih tentunya,, itu untuk membayar apa yg sudah terjadi .. setelah tunangan lu dah sembuh dari ngambeknya... baru lu kurangi yg lu anggap berlebihan..  lu baru bicara dewasanya...    So ,, ini hanyalah ujian bagi kalian berdua... kamu dan dia bisa menjaga kesetiaan gak ? kamu berdua ada yg tergoda gak ? kamu berdua dah tau belum sifat2 pasangan dalam menghadapi masalah..    itulah ujian.. biasanya masih tunangan sih yg enak2 aja,, tapi kalau dah menikah baru deh... semua muncul yg aslinya..    sehingga kamu tidak perlu terlalu bersalah kalau memang dalam hati dan pikiran mu , pertemuan dengan mantan adalah sebagai hubungan teman saja, tanpa lebih.. saya percaya anda,, karena anda berani menceritakan pertemuan anda kepada tunangan anda..     Dgn adanya kasus seperti ini, kamu bisa melihat bagaimana pasangan  anda menyelesaikan masalah... bagaimana sifat aslinya, sedewasa apakah dia...  sehingga anda bisa menilai dirinya , apa yg perlu dia perbaiki, apa yg perlu anda perbaiki..    So kurangi rasa takut anda,, yg sebenarnya anda takut adalah kalau pasangan anda tidak mau berubah dan tidak bereaksi..     dengan adanya kasus seperti ni, cinta lah yg membawa kita untuk saling intropeksi diri,, yg penting kalian berdua mau berkomunikasi... tidak mencari siapa yg benar dan siapa yg salah..    hidup itu adalah perubahan, selalu berubah.. takutkah anda dgn perubahan ?|`|AFTlyMWdaa	klu dia masih mengungkit2 masalah ini berarti dia belum tulus memaafkan kamu, sebenarnya kamu gak salah klu nonton ato makan bareng ma orang lain hanya saja jangan mantan kamu, klu pergi dengan mantan kamu ato teman cowok kamu berdua jelas lah tunangan kamu marah, tapi tidak selayaknya dia marah sampai berlarut2, coba intropeksi diri apakah kamu menyadari kesalahan kamu? saya rasa kamu belum tulus meminta maaf kepadanya karena kamu sendiri yang mengatakan klu kamu gak merasa bersalah, jelas ini mempengaruhi cara kamu meminta maaf, coba mintalah maaf sekali lagi padanya dengan tulus dan katakan kalu anda benar2 menyesal melakukan itu...dan mintalah padanya tuk tulus memaafkan kamu dan jangan mengungkit2 masalah ini lagi jika ingin hubungan kalian baik2 saja, ingat dalam hubungan itu yang diperlukan adalah keterbuakaan ato komunikasi keduanya bukan kompetisi...jadi gak ada yang menang ato kalah jika saling memaafkan setelah saling berkomunikasi dan menyatakan keinginnanya...    oke mbak...yang baik2 aja ya...klu masih sayang dan cinta gak usah pernah berfikir tuk berpisah deh...|`|ytTpsECvaa	hmmm.. saranku adalah kamu harus bersabar,, beri dia waktu,, ok!|`|206NkHmlaa	Sebenarnya persoalan ini kembali kepada diri anda sendiri. Karena tunangan anda itulah yang bakal jadi pendamping hidup anda dalam keadaan susah dan senang.

Yaa...mumpung klian masih tahap tunangan kan. jd sesulit apapun yg klian hadapi pastikan bs klian berdua selesaikan baik2. Klo nggak bs trus gmn nanti klo klian uda nikah.   Pdahal klo aq pikir harusnya dia bersyukur pnya tunangan kaya km. yg uda mau jujur, ga nutup2in apa yg uda km lakuin. sekalipun itu jg nyakitin bwt dia. tp toh akan lbh baik baik kan klo dia tau smua itu dr km sndiri.   Saran Q klo km bener2 cinta n sayang bgt sm tunangan km, km hrs pertahankan hubungan kalian. aq yakin dia jg masih sayang bgt sm km...mgkin dia sakit hati aja. ya smntara km hrs sabar dlu. beri dia pngertian n yakinkan dia klo km masih cinta n sayang bgt sm dia. n minta dia untk kasih km kesempatan untk perbaiki ksalahan km tanpa dia ungkit2 lg masalah itu.

NsYIUu3caa	just let her know you're there for her if she needs any help, like a shoulder to cry on or just to release about anything.  as far as doing anything don't change anything you're doing now. if anything when she starts to talk about her mom try bringing up funny and good memories to help her smile or laugh.    most important thing is to let your friend know that you're there for her in her time of need|`|b2I6gK12aa	I'm so sorry about her mom. I could never imagine losing my parents at such a young age. Since it's only been two months since her passing I wouldn't bring it up with her. I think she wants to grieve by herself and wants to get her mind off of it. If she brings it up herself make sure you're there for her though, what she needs now more than anything is a friend. I would try to have mostly small talk unless she brings up her mother. I would maybe go on the internet, show her some fun sites, play some games.. Remember she may be very sensitive to many things now so try not to talk much about how great mothers are or anything and don't bring up death. Just make sure she's feeling welcome and like she's not alone. Best of wishes...|`|M91KFwdgaa	a good way to see if she wants to talk about it is to just say im sorry for what happen and if she starts talking about it then just let her talk and hear her out.  if not then when you see her say the same thing and ask her if she wants to talk about it,the most you can do is just be there for her and comfort her make sure she gets it off her chest let her remember the good times she had with her mother.    hope everything works out|`|oPi9GQk9aa	dont metion it unless she asks to talk about it or something then let her vent her feelings to u or just try to keep her mind off of it|`|gI3aBxCuaa	Don't really bug her, because all she'll do is be quiet or maybe even be angry. Just stay quiet.|`|M0EehbBEaa	I dont think you should talk to her about it. Its kind of the same situation with one of my friend's, but the scenario is diferent. Talk about things she likes and eat her favourite food. Make her feel especially wanted|`|cb4HEkGhaa	I dont think you should bring it maybe if she wants you can get it out her head, take her for an ice-cream or something|`|ZJ8UafSkaa	well i think you should just be a good friend act like nothings changed because shes probably sick to death of people treating her differently dont be ignorant though just be kind and make sure she knows you will always be there for her and that you dont want to push her into talking about it but if she needs to talk to you you are there abviously nothing can replace a human but it will get easier for her in time|`|qAhkY91Xaa	Don't talk about it unless she starts to talk about it,  my dad died when i was ten, five years ago and i feel uncomfortable when people start to talk about him.|`|Obu9NUjTaa	Just let her do what she wants to do, dont get your opinions in things even if you dont want to do it.  Stay quite enless she wants to talk Dont nag her  If she wants to talk, talk about the good times, and that she will always be with her in her heart, say that good things about her and say that everything is going to be okay  If you want to take her mind of it and she doesnt want to talk go and see a movie but check that no one dies in it, it might make her upset or go skating and fall and then she will laugh and that might take her mind of it, or go for a walk and when you are somewere with no one around she might want to talk. but dont pressure her into talking  Hope this helps

Not being judgmental but after hearing a similar case I know what he is.   Here is the case--lady moves to Cali. soon starts going to night school to get some education; guy (classmate) makes a move (too nice) not in a sexual way but like you here--".....this guy walks up and starts going on and on about how much my son reminds him of his son, blah, blah, blah....". Still being new to the area the guys tells her he can take her to school; she agrees; maybe on the first time or second he is taking her home; he tells her he needs to pick something up from a friend; being classmates, she does nothing (but is concerned---her instincts kick in) he drives her to an ally and rapes the living daylights of her (in other words did everything he could to her) after he rapes her he tells her to keep quiet or her would kill her; she tells her husband--he blames her. the marriage suffers............ This guy you meet was grooming you--getting you to trust him and then he acts out.  Keep safe at all times and never trust too much|`|o0Badlndaa	He is rude, crude and socially unacceptable .... what he is doing is close to stalking ... have no more contact with him .... if it continues get the police involved ..... you do not have to put up with his nonsense ....

It's harder than it looks, and I wouldn't see him as lazy.|`|J4W68owgaa	Ha!! Would I think he was a lazy bum who doesn't want to work? No.     I'm a SAHM and have been for almost 5 years, if my husband wanted to trade places and be a SAHD, more power to him. He can have the 24/7 job, no sick pay, no vacations, no respect, and people saying he's "just" a SAHD.    Honestly though, there are so many men out there who don't take care of their kids, don't spend time with them, don't do anything except create them that if my husband (or any man) wanted to put the work into a thankless job like being a stay at home parent, I'd salute them.|`|8nGZV6ufaa	No I don't think that constitutes them as being lazy bums...Especially if they are taking care of domestic things...It is just as important as a career.  Just my thoughts.  take care.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	No Not at all.    We have had some time when he stayed home and I worked and it was very nice.

I wouldn't live with a boyfriend.   Anyway, it would depend on if I could support the family with only my income. I'd give him the benefit of the doubt and expect things to get done around the house and the kids to be well taken care of. I'm a stay at home mom, and my husband trusts me with these things and doesn't even get on my case about stuff. I do everything as far as running the household and taking care of our daughter so I'd expect the same from him.

If he did all the work that it requires I would jump on the oppurtunity in a heart beat and work two jobs if I have to.  If he did dishes three times a day after each meal and swept the floor every night mopped once a weak bathed the kids vacuumed and did laundry three times a weak payed all the bills and ran all the errands cleaned the bathrooms etc... No I would not consider him lazy.      Right now I would be so much more thankful if my husband would pick up after him self.  Like put his clothes in the dirty clothes basket throw away his pop cans put his dish in the sink........|`|AA10876072	I think stay at home dads are not lazy if they actually take care of domestic matters. Meaning, keeping everything in the household taken care of.  Cleaning, washing clothes, making meals, etc. etc. etc.    If they are just staying home to lay around and watch tv and eat bonbons then that definitely is a lazy bum not wanting to work and support the family.    It doesn't have to be the woman who stays home.  I think that it is up to the family who brings home the bacon, so to speak.    I say if it works well for your family then by all means do it.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	There is absolutely a billions reasons for lazy wives and lazy husbands that do nothing at home.  Maybe there are slightly depressed, because he or she cannot get that perfect job or what ever the reason could be. Etc, etc.  Not everyone has the super high energy to be successful in life in general.  Life is hard as is!  Marriage can make life even more harder, when things are not going according to idea. Some husband or wives are used to living a simple low budget life and some cannot stand living poor.  Some spouses absolutely need the extreme luxuries of life in order to be fully happy in life in general.  edit: What can you do?  Do the best you can in this life. One can only do so much in this world, since we are not getting any younger or more healthier as we age into the future.  As husband, I know exactly what it takes to support a family.  Not everyone has all the luck in this world to have a successful perfect job.  Just take it one day at a time, slowly but surely and you will live a long happy life with your one and only spouse.|`|K6vEbdqxaa	What is wrong with a father wanting to stay at home for a while with the kids?

I adhere to the philosophy, to each their own.|`|HeJjK8slaa	I would think, why can't he be a father and work at the same time? Unless the husband and wife have an agreement that he should be a dad and she works. Some families do that.

You could be the next one on unemployment.   Maybe I'm a new-found unemployed stay at home dad but as most moms will tell you if he watches the kids after school, makes dinner and cleans the house he's certainly not a lazy bum without ambition.  I doubt you'll find many of them since most of the women would be bringing home sufficient money to accomodate the family lifestyle and the husband best be keeping up his end.|`|173830f3415dc7000d83c1d63bc5809eaa	I would say Cats but I can`t so will say cats instead.

Try this; whenever you see him getting angry about something like that, ignore the behavior, don't make a big deal out of it.    Whenever he doesn't get all angry and jealous, give him LOTS of attention, hold his hand and kiss him and be cute alot with him in public. It not only takes the eyes off you, but it makes him feel like, "YES, this is MY wife, SEE? She likes me, she's giving me affection! HA!"    So, do it, don't enforce the bad behavior by making a big deal, but definitely praise him before he has a chance to start caring.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Listen to ZaZa. As cute as you are, your husband might as well get used to it. Really.|`|XfhkQwKIaa	You should keep reinforcing that notion that it's a compliment because jealousy is poison to a relationship.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	He needs more attention from you. Especially in public. Hold his hand, touch his arm when you're talking to him, give him little glances & kisses. ~ Not only will he be distracted from the googlers but it will make him feel better being with you & him knowing you're not paying any attention to other guys. ~ He just sounds insecure. It'll pass... but you have to help him realize that he IS the only man you're concerned with getting attention from.   Good luck.|`|naequcqlaa	Just tell him looking doesn't hurt anything.  He says he doesn't trust men?  then how much does he trust you!  Tell him when they stop looking, that's when he should start to worry...lol  I'd honestly say that's a big dose of insecurity on his part to react as he is.  You're not going anywhere, so just assure him & ask him what does he want you to do about it.  This is not your fault & he should not get upset w/you over it as there's not a thing you can do.  Ask him if he just wants to stay home all the time so he won't have to worry about it.  You've got to be able to go out & enjoy yourself when you do.  These guys that look, look at all the females, they're just that kind of a person.  Tell him to just ignore it & stop making both of you miserable over it.  Best to you...:)|`|SzQi9N7daa	Hun if your wearing jeans and a t shirt and guys are taking a second look I think he should enjoy the fact that other guys think your nice looking.  Either that or you have a hole in your jeans!  LOL    Sorry bud you need to lighten up. Cant go through life or a relationship thinking your going to fight all the dogs in the pound.  There's too many and lifes to short.  Take care of your business and treat her right and you wont have to worry about the other dogs at all.|`|lZtkJeUHaa	It's simple, your married, so in a way your his and no other mans. Why would he want to feel like he has to share you with other men? Or fear that they may approach you in an impolite or harassing matter? It could be just out of jealousy, any men do this. It's not an un common thing. Clearly he loves you and just doesn't want anyone else to see you the way he sees you.|`|8HdnE6G2aa	You should tell him that next time he sees a guy checking you out to come over and put his arm around you or on your butt or something that lets them know that you're taken! He really should take it as a compliment, but tell him to basically rub it in the other guys' face that they can't have you.|`|ZaQ6iQWMaa	He should take it as a compliment! I wonder what is going on in that head of his.  I'd talk to him about this, because it might become a means of controlling you and where you go. I think he's either cheating himself or incredibly insecure. I hope it's the latter, but you guys need to talk about this. Otherwise, you won't be going anywhere without his watchful eye following you.|`|jFfiNXbAaa	lol its because your husband is just like my friend's bf  a freaking control freak  not long till he abuses you   sorii hon.  no offence  he just is controlling you  if he realy loved you  he woudln't try to change you   and if you realy love him  you woulnd't post this|`|zvpyr76Baa	He is insecure.  He has always been like that since you first started dating him but he just felt he had to hide it to keep you interested.  Insecurity is a very unattractive quality and he is mart enough to know that.  Now that you are married he let his guard down.  He will always be like this until you get to be in your late 20's early 30's and arnt that attractive to him anymore.  If I were you I would just enjoy it while it lasts because once he stops getting mad about it, that's when you know he isnt attracted like he used to be.|`|024910ffc7104c135d901f2da8f1011daa	I am sure that despite what he says to your, he just doesn't trust you.  It is quite possible that in his perception, your behaviour could be a bit provocative and drawing attention of men.|`|5HoZ3NHeaa	From what you have stated, his profile is that of a closet drinker. He needs help, enlist family to convince him to seek help.|`|4POGapREaa	Men trust other men just about as much as we trust other women.  Your husband just happens to be a bit of a chick LOL!  Sorry but he sounds pissy & insecure.  My husband notices too but tells me in funny ways or if it really freaks him out he starts biting on his lower lip but he would never ruin a night for me.  I guess if you put yourself in his shoes you could understand because if there were a bunch of little tarts checking out his @ss at the buffet, you'd probably wanna drop kick one of them, but it's not typical for a dude to act all jealous & butt hurt about it.  And btw I'm 37 & my husband is 39.  When you're 40 he's going to be stressing over the 40+ dudes AND the 20-somethings.  He just doesn't like seeing his competition.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Sounds like my ex from hs.Yes, HS lol He really needs to grow up.Maybe he is just insecure or feels like he doesn't deserve you. Like his life is too good to be true and he thinks other men are looking to take that from him.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	He needs to grow up. Holy crap.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	well your obviously a hottie!  so any guy would get mad that others check his women out  tell him how you feel about it  and explain that you know he doesnt trust the men  but he has to let it go  he cant always be like that  besides, i dont really think the men would try anything  just dont talk to them lol|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Next step, he's gonna start hitting you...and blame you for it.  Dump him before the abuse starts.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	It seems to be a form of jealousy , and her should never let that show or even enter his mind . You did marry him and seem to be very loyal , someone admiring your shape or form is only doing what every man and woman do at sometime married or not . It is  a very sincere form of flattery to you and to your husband for having the good senses to make you his wife and that you and he are still together . If jealousy rears  its ugly head in a marriage , it tends to begin to make both of you distrustful , yet knowing there is nothing to fear . You just start making up scenarios in your head and that ain't good . Take it as a compliment to your wife and how good she looks and as a compliment to your good taste and judgment . My wife and I have been married for 42 years now and my wife still tells me and I know it to be true , it don't matter where you get your appetite as long as you come home for supper . And it seems from your question that both of you are doing that . Good luck and God bless
slHUNl58aa	I think Jim nailed it with his answer. Telling her what was awesome after lovemaking to get easy conversation flowing.    What I do is tell my spouse I was thinking of you today and I should be arrested.  Then I describe my mental picture of said thoughts in detail.   Try it, call her from work and make her day.  It gives your spouse a mental blue print of the mechanics part without having to say..gee honey I wish you would do this.  The other cool thing is it makes them want to try it out because it is a huge turn on to know you are desired with such abandon and that your spouse is fantasizing about you.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Interesting..possibly embarrassed.    We do talk but we are pretty open about it all ..neither one of us clams up.|`|encb0jc2aa	she gets really turned on by it, especially when we talk about ratchet wrenches and screwdrivers|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	It's probably not secrecy - is she a shy person? maybe that is the problem she could be embarrased because she maybe gets wild or whatever and she knows she wouldnt do that outside of the bedroom but does without thinking about it. if that make sense... = 0|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I personally think it's sexy to talk about it--assuming it isn't criticism or comparison.  Are you criticizing your spouse's performance?  Don't do this.  Or maybe she's just shy.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Damn, Eddie -- another good question! We talk about it: mechanics, likes, dislikes, turnons, etc. However, I've known women who f**k like w**res but can't talk about a simple kiss outside the bedroom. Weird.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Maybe she is worried that you will say she is bad in bed. Some people don't like to talk about it. Start by sharing a fantasy or something and then go from there. Start with all the positive things she does. The things that drive you crazy in bed would be a great place to start. My husband and I have been married for three years and we can talk about it very easily.|`|b553da45b259fca50eed89cd57ec9ca6aa	I'm not married.. I'm divorced now.. but one of the hottest sexual relationships I had was when we were both not only able to communicate our wants and needs, but open to exploration and pushing the boundaries.       |`|rDmMk9Soaa	We talk about it extensively. We watch porn together and tell each what we like and don't like. We like to experiment. Maybe what you should be discussing is why she has hang ups, but don't be pushy. She needs to feel comfortable. Build trust.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Truth is - we do it, but its embarrassing to actually talk about the sweaty, nasty things we do. Its like the difference between having a bowel movement and talking about the mechanics of a bowel movement. Its natural, but somehow we're not normally wired about talking about the nasty stuff.     Be kind, and maybe ease into conversations - particularly if you're trying to talk about ways to spice things up. Or, better yet, bring it up after a few drinks.....|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Lately I will walk up to my husband and whisper in his ear all of the kinky things that I am going to do to him when boom boom time is coming and then he does this thing as if I am tickling him, turns red, laughs and tells me how dirty I am.|`|5boLbxzdaa	How can you learn what your partner likes so you can please them fully if they don't talk about it?  Talking about sex is a MUST!|`|NSKimt1Qaa	We could talk about it, but I am a lady, too, so I think I can relate to your wife's feelings.  It might depend on how you talk.  Do you talk to her lovingly or like she's an object?|`|dLPONQQVaa	Embarrassment and awkwardness, making love is natural and should not be made complicated by discussing the physics or chemistry of it, it just ruins the fun, it is based on emotions and NOt on science, though still a biological process let her be..|`|LMIbr1aeaa	We always compliment each other hot bodies.|`|81wvN8Rraa	No secrets here we talk about every thing that happens.|`|WlnnsGM5aa	It is healthy to talk about it, maybe you should ask her why it bothers her. Maybe there is a deeper problem.|`|Z1atdG4kaa	I don't know...as long as no one else is around I don't care when my husband brings it up to me. We don't discuss what we're gonna do to eachother before we do it or anything like that (too much talking lol). Some people are very shy about that stuff though.|`|MRDJu8v3aa	The subject of sex is still a taboo in a lot of families. Maybe she was raised in such an environment.     1. Make sure that you are attending to her sexual and emotional needs and give her time to learn that it is OK to talk with her husband about sex.     2. Make sure you are listening to her and not just talking. Sometimes there are non verbal messages that something else is going on in a partner's life that is preventing her from wanting to talk about it.    3. Start off slowly telling her how wonderful it was for your or how much you enjoy making love to her and tell her one reason why it was so good. If she changes the subject, let it go. But each time you have sex, do this and with time she will get accustomed and why start responding. Then you can have the longer chats that you are looking for ;-)|`|jh00NAj3aa	I think some people are talkers, some are doers, and others are talkers and doers.      So in your relationship, it's most likely not secrecy, but what comes natural, and it's simply not natural for your wife to talk about it, and your doing so probably makes her feel uncomfortable.      As for me and my spouse, neither of us talk about the nuts and bolts, we just screw!|`|024910ffc7104c135d901f2da8f1011daa	If you love her, just respect her wish. She just doesn't like to talk about those things. I have found out that kind of reaction as a very feminine, thus stimulating men's imagination. Talking about logistic of sex is just like talking about your home improvement plans. You do not need to tell her what you are going to do to her in bed. Just do that in the most intimate manner with a lot of affection. She would definitely prefer that to your " sex logistic".|`|3iNobwVraa	That's weird unless you are newly together.  We definitely talk about all the nitty gitty details.  We both ask and offer info, before, during, and after.  We didn't always, it took time, and trust (on my part),but once I opened up, I feel completely comfortable asking what he wants, answering questions about what I want, and offering info about same.    Keep trying, maybe.  She's just not comfortable with you in this way...maybe time will help.    Good Luck!|`|NYQhhNbzaa	What a shame your wife doesn't what to talk to you openly about your love making.  Have you asked her why she doesn't want to discuss it?      I'm sure most couples  don't discuss the "mechanics" of sex while being intimate, but will communicate to each other where, how and what their wants or needs are before and after. some during.   Its all part of the getting to know each others likes and dislikes, but after a few years or decades together,  I don't understand how a partner would not or could not discuss the finer points of sex.    There really shouldn't be any secrecies.  Perhaps she's concerned the children might over hear the conversation, choose a better time to discuss those logistics?|`|pnxzK1nhaa	What is there to talk about if we both know what the other likes??    Just do it!    I don't go "Woah babe, that was a nice move you busted about ten mins into the act" and nor does he.As long as we got ours we don't care about what actually took place.
kn2glb6zaa	That's a tough one! I would probably say the wife, but you know, if the husband is standing there swinging that thing like a lasso...you never know!|`|024910ffc7104c135d901f2da8f1011daa	Depending on what corner. Definitely your husband would fare much better hooking any corner in Castro.|`|EdBCksSwaa	Neither,I wouldnt nail you with your husbands crank let alone my own so there is no chance in hel that I would pay,try throwing your grandma out there|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Today that would be toss up. Pimp your hubby if don't want the corner.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	What a ridiculous question.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	My husband would totally make more money than I would. I'd be a nervous wreck standing on some random corner. Plus I'm 7 months pregnant right now :P  He'd stand there naked and dance.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	HAA- he would.  Nobody wants a plus-size hoochie mama.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	We doesn't need the money.|`|RBQrgByeaa	The wife. Guys are easy to attract.    I think I would be a better high-end escort, though. I'm more suave and talented in the sack.|`|nAwLPHHNaa	whos hotter?|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Wife.|`|5boLbxzdaa	That depends on if the wife looked like the husband.      Hey...it happens!      I'd say most likely the wife.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Excellent question, JayJay. The wife.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Depends on who looks the best.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	The wife...she puts a pair of Nikes on the husband and sends him off to work...duh.|`|y9CgveCGaa	The wife I think.  Especially in our family.
vC6O0tztaa	Yes my wife said she love me but wasnt in love with me. I ask her if she was cheating she said no, so I did my own investigation come to find out she was cheating and in love with this other guy.  I move out we are getting a divorce and she with this guy now.  I never cheated on her fcuk it man if this is your case cut her lose.  If you want to talk feel free to email me.|`|nVMAOJd7aa	I have and you know what be thankful they did leave. I mean I wouldn't of known and they would of made my life a living hell and I would of wasted the best years of my life being fake to my goals!  I didn't see this point in the whole thing until a year later , but I am glad he told me and exit that door. I wouldn't want someone to play house with me, I want a real "theres no place like home" type of a thing. I may sound bitter , but I'm really not. I talk to him once in a while and we are both happier today then we were then. I just never realized it! I realized now that I wasn't happy neither I knew then that something was wrong , but I always pulled the covers over my eyes .|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Well, as far as your additional details go, I cannot provide my own experience for you.  He decided his lifestyle was more important than being married to me and a father to our son and I didn't love him when he left or realize otherwise after I was alone...  I cannot speak for him.    I can tell you that as a divorce attorney I do occasionally draft Reconciliation Agreements for couples.  I know they work for at least 6 months, but beyond that I cannot say.|`|AA12272885	No didn't happen that way.  I divorced my husband because I didn't love him, and I never regretted it.|`|encb0jc2aa	she is ou getting some real man meat, when she is tired and loose she will be back|`|0d4X54rMaa	when someone says they dont love you  they usually dont  they are with you for some other reason  yours sounds like she would rather be with you than alone given the choice of the two|`|nAwLPHHNaa	This is tricky bc sometimes being alone only makes you think your in love, bc ur lonely!  if your referring to yourself, im going to assume you left bc you weren't happy anymore.. there are so many reasons people leave.. and usually its for the best.. once ur out..you should stay out UNLESS and UNTIL you've sought counseling..!  being lonely plays on emotion.. all u think about is the good things..somehow u seem to forget all the stuff that has gotten u to this place to begin with...   try to get through it.. OR seek counseling together.. maybe its too late.  i wish u the best and hope it all works out however its suppose too.
AA12272885	It has happened to me, also shaking uncontrollably, and numbness in my legs and hands.  I think it is just the intense emotions and feelings that cause this, it is a way of releasing the very strong feelings.  It only happened to me when I was very much in love and comfortable with someone.|`|ScHW4842aa	i did because i remembered being raped. not nice.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Sometimes, people cry after sex because they feel strong emotions for their partner. Other times, they cry because they feel violated, they weren't in the mood, they feel self-concious or like they aren't good enough, that kind of thing. If someone cries after you have sex with them, you'd best ask them why they're crying.|`|UE6F9L6maa	I did it once. I thought it was going to be my first one night stand it lasted a year and a half.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I've done it quite a few times and it has to have something to do with a rush of hormones and chemicals. When it happens, there is  a flood of feelings and you can't even begin to control it. It freaked my husband out the first time. He was convinced that something was wrong or that he'd hurt me which wasn't the case at all. He's learned that if it happens to just hold me and let me cry...|`|SawySuLRaa	Hormones do crazy things to women.|`|e1oky4jSaa	The only time I ever cried after sex was when I did it with my ex ( I was single and not seeing anyone else at the time) and I felt low for doing that because I just needed affection and ran back to the old flame which was not healthy.|`|ZaQ6iQWMaa	I have, because I felt overwhelmed with emotion and love for that person. It felt great, and they were tears of love and joy.|`|HeJjK8slaa	Because they really don't want to make love, and are doing it to make her partner happy?|`|7tmbTGkoaa	Well its emotional, and most of the time its when you've done somthing right and sooo good.|`|ZtfN4J6taa	I used to cry every time after we've had sex with my ex-wife. She was that bad !|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I have, many times, just because I was so emotionally wrapped up in my hubby, and happy, and fulfilled. It was a spiritual experience!|`|cFrtOg45aa	This is the first I heard of someone crying after sex. Very bizarre if you ask me. I think I would only cry if his thing was small.    I guess you people who are crying so much over sex because it's such an emotional and  spiritual experience aren't getting it often.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	I have to admit.. I've done it once. Why...because I was emotionally envolved and you feel more connected when you are.|`|hMavMBo4aa	My husband and I: neither have ever done this.  Maybe an intense emotional connection or something like that: something really great.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	The emotional connection, and overwhelming love.   Much more common in women, although some men do it too.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	I've done it more than once.I've done it alot. I mean who wouldn't when you are coming down from a high that amazing?!it is like a flood of emotions comes running out that you just can't help it...It happens when I have just had awesome sex.    Orgasms that great are the closest I am going to get to heaven on earth!Like your whole body quivers with relief and everything is like a fantasy.|`|SzQi9N7daa	Dont know never had sex thats been that bad!!    LOL|`|81wvN8Rraa	I never have but I guess it's possible.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I did the other night when my husband was hell bent on watching a program on the antichrist immediately after some great sex, I wanted a good ten minutes of afterglow dammit.

AA11969451	I didn't marry until I was 31, I did not take my husbands last name when we married. After 3 years of marriage I took his name but not because I felt like chattel but because I wanted to share his name.  I do relate to what you are saying and there is no law that says you have to give up your birth name. Some women chose to use a hyphen but even that is not a requirement.     Be your own woman, do what makes you happy.|`|RtAML1fJaa	i am from italy and my husband is american in my country there is no such thing as changing your last name after marriage but since i came to the united states for some reason  my last name has changed.  even my green card has my husband last name and i have applied with my maiden name. now i have 4 different id"s and 2 have my maiden name(passport and driver's license) and 2 with my husband"s last name(military id and green card)  it is very confusing and stupid to change last name i think i like the last name my father gave me.|`|FSVLMQBmaa	Change your name and throw a great party to launch your new identity! Don't worry about taking or not taking your future husband's surname. There are just too many what ifs to bother with:  What if:  I hate his surname  I love his surname  he demands I take his name  doesn't care if I take his surname  we create a new name for the both of us  I hyphenate my new married name  I never get married and wasted all this stress over nothing?   Take my advice change your name if you really, really want to (knowing there will be inconveniences from banks and other institutions) and don't worry about "Mr. Maybe..."

If a couple is hosting a party it is BOTH of their "job" to prepare the home, snacks, etc for their guests. If it's his party, then he should do the preparations, and vice versa.    ...or they might split the duties such as she prepares the snacks, and he cleans up the mess afterward.|`|SK7MxFTnaa	What? Can't get off your lazy fat *** and do it yourself?|`|mPrUYEDiaa	It depends on the scenario. If the guy is having a bunch of his friends over and the wife doesn't really wanna watch the game anyway, so it's kind of a guy's day, then yeah, it'd be nice of her to make the snacks. but if it's like a party and she'll have friends there too, then no, it's both of their responsibilities and they should both contribute to the party or food making process. if it's a delema, have her make some things and you can ask your friends to bring stuff. if you think this is tacky, quit treating your woman like your own personal beyotch and get off your lazy butt and do it yourself.     in my opinion, of course. :) lol|`|UNLrYNeUaa	absoultely, a woman needs to know her place during such an important event!

BxhC9fXEaa	First check if she has anybody else she is going to the dance w/ . Ask one of her close friends if she has anyone else that she's going. w/. This will hint that you wnat to go w/ her. Most likely she'll tell the girl you like that you want to go to the dnace with her, and then it won't come as a surprise to her. Then when any of her firends are'nt around(catch her alone) and ask her very casually, "So you have anyone you plan to go w/ to the dance?" and if she says no, then ask"So, idk, you want to go w/ me?" and when ur doing this don't look unsure of yourself. Be sure of yourself. Good luck!|`|VtGH1bDaaa	YES!!!!
G024yAU3aa	I do, she is very sick and I finally had to step away from my relationship with her after dealing with it for 25 years.  If your mother is mentally ill and cruel to you and refuses to acknowledge it or get treatment you need to do what is right for you and separate yourself from her.    I am very close with my father (my mother's 2nd husband of 3 FAILED marriages) and my step dad as well (her 3rd FAILED marriage).      My mother has BPD-Borderline Personality Disorder and her rages and the things that she has put me through emotionally are uncomprehensible to a normal mother.  If your issue is simular let me know and we can get in contact and I will help you through it the best I can.     Good Luck!|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Yes I do get along with my mother.    As for my other birthgiver, I could care less about him.|`|aXYiOskmaa	sorry to hear this. there's nothing like the love of a mother and it's a shame you've never felt it. my mom and i got along great until her death 14 yrs ago.  other than the typical adolescent crap, i never even argued with my mom. there was no need and i respected her and what she said.  my dad? well, we had our share of disagreements but now that i'm older with kids of my own, i know just where he was coming from.  so nope. no real "bad feelings" toward either of them.  i wish you and your mom could work things out.|`|dalNxu8zaa	hell no...ido not...whenever  i need something i go to my dad even for girl problems|`|bkgBLjuvaa	sometimes i do.?|`|AA11016526	My mother and my daughter are best friends|`|JUEkTETAaa	i do ..we do not get along at all in the same room but when we are apart we can talk like mother and daughter|`|AA10204048	I wouldn't say we do... we're fine when we don't discuss anything of any consequence. then we're ok but she always attacks me for everything I say or she thought I meant or anything... gah|`|YW6cDP96aa	Mom and i get along for the most part we duel raise my sister since my dad is to drunk to care......we didn't get along though  until i was like 19 I moved out at 16 and didn't realy come back to her house until i was 19 basically because i had no where else to go and now we get along much better|`|ZTiJeGlxaa	it's called teen agnst.  I could not stand my parents when I lived with them.  I have real issues with my father, but the only reason I didn't get along with my mother was because we lived together and basically butted heads the whole time.  Sometimes, when you and someone else have so much in common, but different ideas and way of thinking, it's hard to cohabit.  When you think you know it all, and your parents are being stupid, step back and think about it from their point of view.  It will be hard, but you've only got a few more years until you can move out.      Disclaimer: if your parents are neglecting you (not giving you food, water, shelter, education) or physically or emotionally abusing you, talk to someone about it and get help.      If they are just being "over protective" or putting on a show, take it one day at a time.|`|WlwSQvE0aa	I love my parents, but sometimes I get really mad at them. Me and my parents have a close relationship where I'll show them how I feel, the way I feel. If I'm angry, I'll be mad, and they understand that and give me my space and stuff.
7yyC65tfaa	now that you have his address stop by and paintball his house|`|Tp0cIlWnaa	It makes sense...why else would some one bash a stranger, unless they are diverting attention. This man was instigated. The woman challenged his intellectual status by proposing the exam, he was intimidated to air his results on tv and therefore created a diversion.     This show tonight shattered any hopes that education fosters intellectuals and wisdom...it is not education, apparently. What a waste of all those government grants and public handouts this British guy used to cheat his way into acadamia. He behaved quite primitively.     The incredible rage, self hatred, and intellectual emptyness in this person was evident through his compulsive fixation with another person's level of education. If this other lady, who demonstrated tremendous self restraint, was indeed a "lowly educated red neck" why was she all he could talk about, was there nothing more that his massive brain could find to amuse himself...    Yes he did seem like the abusive sort, who cowardly abuses their family indoors, and put on a mask for the public (atleast VforVendetta mask looked better), laughs when it becomes to awkward. His children were not sa|`|Xe5aS6tCaa	What astounded me about Mr. & Mrs. Fowler was their self-professed obsession to help "America" with their obesity and environmental issues, yet place themselves in an elite community, and I'm certain charge handsomely for the privilege of helping others.    Mr. Fowler is a clear example of education and privilege not fostering sensitivity or class. He assumed those of Middle America were a cliche of low standards, all the while showing himself to be incredibly low brow. I can't even call him a man as no man manipulates or degrades anyone, much less his own children and their friends in the manner he did. Were I a parent of one of the children he verbally attacked, I wouldn't allow my child in that toxic environment.    Mr. and Mrs. Fowler; here is my challenge to you. If you care so much about helping "Middle America" with the very real challenges of obesity and environmental awareness as you say you do, go there. Move to Missouri, or Louisiana, or Arkansas and open up a clinic. Charge people $15/hour rather than $200 and start a grass roots recycling program. This would convince me of your supposed sincerity towards helping the world and their citizens as you profess you do. I would suggest however that you watch your manners.    And Mr. Fowler, I congratulate you on escaping the table meeting unscathed. Mr. Long showed more restraint and class than you shall ever have. I and many others wouldn't have had Mr. Longs generosity. Your wife and children I am sure will look upon your behavior and feel humiliation and shame. You use your gifts and skills as weapons against those you see as inferior, you are every bit a bully as one who starts brawls in bars with those physically smaller than they.|`|pw3y3Eo0aa	yea

2k8p1ZI8aa	First of all, I know this must be frustrating to you. Unfortunately a lot of parents think keeping their kids on a leash is the best way to keep them from hanging out with the wrong crowd or to avoid any unfortunate situations.     You're 17, in some places you are considered an adult already. The best thing to do is to stop yelling and accusing them of this and that, act like an adult and tell them you need to talk to both in private, about things that are concerning you at the moment.    Try these tips:    1. In the most calmed way, tell them to first listen to you. That you need them to respect you and listen to everything you have to say before interrupting, just like they would with any one else.    2. Start by talking about the main 3 things that are bothering you a lot at the moment and/or lately.    3. Ask them about the reasons of not trusting you. Let them speak until they finish.    4. Ask them for a 1 time test. Meaning, you go somewhere and come back at a certain time. But don't let them down because you're only gonna go back to where you started.     5. Relate to them to when they were your age. Ask them how they felt when they were your age and if their parents didn't trust them or gave them the opportunity to enjoy their youth like any other youngster.  Ask them how they felt towards their parents and if they somewhat held some resentment towards them. Tell them you don't want to hate them or dislike them, but that you also have the right to go out and have a healthy state of mind for your own sake and theirs.    If this doesn't work, try talking to another family member, perhaps your aunt/uncle or that sweet grandma/pa who always understands you will be able to help.  That way they can also discuss it with your stubborn parents, so that they get a point of view from someone outside the family.    Good luck and hope this helps.|`|775Tqe9caa	If you want your independence and freedom you will have to wait until you are 18 and are able to move out, until then you are stuck in their house with their rules.  You can try sitting them down and having a talk with them letting them know that you are responsible and you will let them know where you are at all times.|`|Vv3UIGWWaa	You poor thing, you can move out next year when you are 18 and it will be more than petrol that you will be payin for ,but you will be free.

There is Absolutely nothing wrong with you having a crush on an older man.  I know exactly how you feel, you get all giddy inside and you can't stop smiling when he's around.  Yeah I know the feeling and it's totally normal.  Now if he were to do something with you, he could get into loads of trouble.  I'm guessing you look older than 13 but (not sure about the law in England) if he were to get with you I'm guessing that would be illegal.  Isn't the age of consent over there 16?  And honestly do you think it would be cool for a guy who is 17 to be with a 13 year old.  You just came into your teens.  But seriously don't feel bad you are a normal 13 year old girl.  Just enjoy the feeling of puppy love.  But don't get him into any trouble.|`|p42QMhtnaa	ok i understand what you're feeling and this is probably not the answer you want but these feelings will pass. Right now he's 17 and you're 13 and both at very different points in your life. Now go ahead and think and daydream about him all you want but you might want to think about a cute guy your own age. He might think you're cute but not as anything more than a friend. A few years from now you'll be crazy about another attainable guy
7G8jNBtiaa	I think you should show your parents that you and your brother are responsible, by suggesting that they go away for a night, and let you and your brother be in charge. If you show them that you are responsible for that one night, then gradually they will be able to trust you both more and more. It will take time, but eventually you'll be allowed to be on your own.|`|FNptdIVfaa	how old r u. if ur 12+ then ur in trouble

It's called good genes and a fast metabolism, nothing you can do about it.    EDIT: Ok, I am married to a women that was called anorexic her entire life because of how tiny she is. If she is eating and not running to the bathroom and no puking sounds are coming out....she is fine!    Labels are a nasty thing and weight is a problem for both bigger and smaller women. My wife is extremely self conscience about her body now opting to wear baggy clothes because she is embarrased. She still gets accused of anorexia! People like you honeslty make me mad, accusing someone of a serious disorder without any found proof is not only mean, but petty.     And just because I am a man, doesn't mean I don't know about these things, guys go thru weight issues too.|`|0eab0b6e32b135981c458e469f63de2eaa	I am the same way!!

If she is anorexic though she's probably not going to tell you...  because most of them don't admit to it. Try talking to her mom or something, I know you may think this is awkward, but if you're really that worried and from what you said, all signs point to her being anorexic, it's probably a really smart move on your choice    good luck!|`|B94G0Y7haa	my friend is kinda the same. she doesn't eat a lot but she is really thin. its just genes, but she is being mean saying those things to you. 90lbs is soo not fat! just bc she's skinny doesn't mean she's healthy. it could be true that she will gain it later and have a weight problem, but also eating unhealthy food will give you other problems, like acne, oily hair, ect.  PS: she's not anorexic. thats a disease where you dont eat. but she could be belemic.... im not sure. shes being immature about it.
F8Qwlvbjaa	you need to make new friends. good ones. yes i think that for you who only chose two good friends it is perfectly normal to think that you have missed out because your twin died. they cannot survive always like this only clinging to each other but move on.|`|LrBI8U0uaa	just talk to ur friends and explain how ya feel. if they seem to completely turn thier backs on you, then maybe it's time to meet some new friends. and it's not stupid to feel angry about your twin sister dying but you're going to have to accept the fact that she passed on.

bb3299947b02635429d1636917fa08aeaa	I don't know what you could say to her that she'll listen to.    You could write her a letter and tell her your feelings. (MAKE SURE that you have written and re written this letter because once you give her the letter you can't take it back, but at the very least you'll be able to express what is in your heart.  Make Sure you let her know how much you really love her!)    Your soon-to-be-step-father probably didn't have to much parental control or input in his children's upbringing.      Since he is gonna be in your life, and HE is blending 3 families you should at least be able to ASK for a family Gathering/Meeting with all the children to iron out any issues BEFORE THE WEDDING.    Good Luck|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	you feel what you feel.  I don't know how to make you not feel it.    have you talked to your mother about this?  have you thought hard about why you don't like him and expressed that to your mother?     Think about what it is that you're afraid of or worried about and talk her about it.    It may not make her stop the wedding but it may make her slow down and reassure you.

I think that, if you go out a lot and need one, you may need one.  I didn't get one until I started driving so that I could be more safe.  But if it's important to you and you don't think your grades will improve any time soon, try doing other things to show your dad that you're responsible.  Pick up around the house, do the things your dad asks, and tell him that you love him :-)  That always helps.  Good luck.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	yes its fair.

But a D in History! that just a lack of trying!  Hell no you shouldn't get anything that might take time away from getting your grades up.|`|AA11447210	I don't think below average grades deserve to be rewarded. If it's a "number one" school that means it should have the best educational opportunity, not that it's the toughest. Get your grades in line and then see down the road if your folks feel a limited use cellphone is appropriate.     Other than for emergencies or calling your folks for a ride or something similar, there's not much reason for kids to have cell phones anyway.|`|sCGWcJTFaa	well somewhat, depends on what you do and if you seem responsible enough.|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	I think that is fair. First of all, you're still young and you got a lot of time for things like cell phone. You don't really need it at this point, because really, all it is going to do is get you more distracted and you're going to be talking on it all the time just because "you have one". If it were for safety reasons, then that would be understandable. But just for fun, I think your dad's right. It's a lot of money for a young girl, and it will get you even more distracted. Maybe bring up your marks and he'll see that maybe you'll be able to focus and he'll reward you with one. But for now, I wouldn't suggest it. There's always your house phone.|`|901e9d9ce5b078735edd579388217ff2aa	its ok buddy i didnt had a phone till when i was 14!!    soo maybe just wait one more year!!|`|TDGhHIvNaa	Yes, it is fair.  Parents make the rules.  If you have lived this long without a cell phone, then chances are you can wait a while longer.  I'd be busy studying those classes you got a D in.  Until you improve your grades I don't think you should count on getting that phone.|`|BqxYa9tEaa	Quit whining.  Get a job and pay for your own cell and your own cell phone bills.    Don't make it harder on your dad than it already is with the state of the economy.  Why not help him out and show that you don't always need his money.|`|AA10093245	Do you get an allowance? If you do, you can get a tracphone  for about 10 to 20 dollars, and buy prepaid minutes, and set it on vibrate only when you're home, and your parents don't even have to know you have one, because there's no contracts or monthly bills for them to ever see. Tracphones may not be "cool" but hey, it's a phone!|`|69qn7muFaa	Well, first off.. Algebra 2 and Chemisty while 13?   Dude, I'm 14 and I'm in Geometry and in Life Science. Sheesh.   Sorry, back to the point.   Well, I guess I can understand that it's hard for you to get good grades with that kind of education. I mean I know it's a top school, but sometimes they need to look at your abilities and work off of that to make you improve, not by forcing you to learn something you don't know how to do.   Some people are just ridiculous.    Well, just try to improve you grades and try your absolute hardest.   That's the only way I can KEEP my phone.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Yes.|`|8VzyNklQaa	ur just gonna have to wait buddy boy!|`|EONhiOGaaa	yep hes not fair i ogt a phone at 11 and im 13 now too :)|`|H6Lc79EOaa	You get junk grades and expect a cell phone...your dad is right!  And you don't need a phone anyway, like that would help your grades...boo hoo little boy.|`|xijxDtdJaa	dude thats just sad|`|u6EJnaVpaa	apparently you shouldn't be goin to the  1 charter school with four D's and you shouldn't get a phone with four D's.|`|5J3JyONoaa	Im a year younger than you and it took me such a long time to get a cell phone. Show him that your working really hard and maybe you'll get one.    Good Luck!|`|Jk6IDgWRaa	Well, if you're in such an elite school, higher standards are expected of you, and your father realizes that. You should definitely show your dad that you are applying yourself to do better and work as hard as you can if you really want that cell phone.|`|Y6IuB97haa	I am 19 and I got a cell phone for my 18th birthday.  Get the grades up and then talk about it.  A cell phone isn't the greatest thing, only convenient some times.  Sometimes it's not about fairness either.  Parent's have their reasons, which is hard to believe sometimes, but there can be financial reasons or it could be your grades. Maybe it is something else, but hey, do you want your parents calling you every time you leave the house?      I dunno, just try to be good, keep the grades up and hey...they are your parents.    Ask your dad why he won't let you get a cell phone.  If it is something you can change (like your grades) work on it.  If it is something like money, then accept it or get a job (there isn't much out there for 13 year olds, but look).  If he says you are too young, ask him why he thinks you are too young.  Sometimes parents have their reasons, but talk.  It could be really good for your cause.|`|AA11330914	yeah its fair. ur 13. and u got bad grades.|`|k15Kvlybaa	well, when my parents didn't let me have a phone it was because i was "too immature". then i started acting like i was mature. i started telling my dad the benefits of having a phone. like.."if i get lost i might need to call someone". or " if you forget to pick me up from school i could call you." stuff like that. hope i helped.|`|DFUN42S9aa	i have good grades and didnt get one till I was 15
ZTiJeGlxaa	I don't know if you can follow this but try, not many people understand so don't worry if you can't but I'll explain the best I can.      You can't turn it inward, when you are right, you are right.  That much you know.  However, there's not only two sides to any problem.  No problem was ever caused by a single incident.  you have actually analyze what happened.   What factors led up to the incident.  If it was a friend that talked behind your back, maybe it was taken out of context.  Maybe he did say something but nothing harmful or hurtful, but when it got back to you, it sounded as if it were.  If a spouse cheated on you, they did something wrong, think of as if something you did caused it, or it was just too much temptation.  If someone does something really messed up, and they try to explain it to you, they didn't mean for it to turn out the way it did, give it a few days and find out what happened and why it happened.  You can forgive someone by rationalizing and putting yourself in their shoes.  Not everything is your fault, but sometimes you have to share the blame.  Sometimes people have mental problems they can't control.  Don't forget that.  That is a major problem for everyone regardless of who they are or what they do or what relationships they have.  Good luck.      I hope it makes a little sense.  But basically open communication, and putting yourself in their shoes makes a big difference.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	I have a real hard time forgiving someone, so I usually just don't! Not sure how old you are, but once you are an adult, you know wrong from right. I do not do my friends wrong, and I expect them to treat me the same way. If they can't, then I'll just find another friend.
AA10529674	I don't think it's really fair for a guy to get all the pleasure and not give it to the girl. I would be so depressed if I was in that kind of relationship. It would make me feel like my husband didn't care enough about me to make me feel good.
Vfio3ABeaa	this is something that i can help you with.      step 1: Look decent  make sure that you take a shower EVERYDAY!! i'm sure that you already do but i'm just making sure. also, wear nice clothes. wear brand names like american eagle, urban outfitters, and abercrombie & fitch. also use some axe cologne.          step 2: be friendly    you seem friendly.. but just make sure that you don't use name calling or swearing.    step 3: don't try to be cool  just be yourself. don't try to be something you're not. if you're shy that's okay, but try to speak up just a little bit more. maybe sign up for football or baseball or hockey or something.         just follow these instructions and you'll have at least 15-20 friends.     good luck and God Bless|`|AA10142515	Friendship is not about quantity, it is about quality. I have only a very few friends, but I know that if they thought it was necessary, they would die for me. And, yes. I would die for them if it was necessary!|`|LrBI8U0uaa	just keep going around to new people you think are friend material and try to talk to them. don't worry if they don't acknowledge you; would ya really want to be friends with someone like that anyways?? just be careful about who your new friends are, cuz i made a few new friends a few months ago and they all turned thier back on me...and whatever you do do not forget about the two friends you already have while looking for new ones. If all else fails, just be happy that you've still got the ones you have right now.|`|2hDlR3Flaa	just keep trying at it and honestly most friends are fake so BE CAREFUL and deffinitly dont turn on ur other friends i garantee u karma is a *****|`|73A0T8ltaa	If ppl can't like you for who you are **** em!!  You're alright in my book, just don't acknowledge them right back, and soon people will think; "wow, he is cool." Trust me.  And do your own thing, be random, spontaneous, care-free, and people will wonder what you have that's so special, and come to YOU.  Then you throw the mack on em.  That's the way we like it ninja!  If that don't work, piss on em-
32lv9NmKaa	in my experience... not enough SEX LOL
EdBCksSwaa	Yeah I have heard of it but I don't get it,,,,,very strange.I would not be comfortable with that and since your on the fence about it I assume you would also be uncomfortable with it,I dont think you should do it.|`|2mhLJl11aa	Yes, I've heard of this. A friend's sister was married to a MLB player (they are now divorced) who liked that kind of thing. His thing was "table topping", which means he likes to s**t on top of a glass table with the woman underneath. I totally do not get it. In fact I think it's repulsive. In the case with your hubby, I believe it's a fetish thing. It would sure fall under that category if you want to research it. You'd have to be interested in it or like it to even begin to get it.     You asked if you should try it... Only if you're open to it. If you're repulsed by it then of course NO, don't. Just be honest with yourself and him.    Good luck. I don't envy your position!|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Heard of it. Never tried it.  Don't want to.  Good Luck.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Now, that's a great way for a man to express his love and respect for his wife.     Tell him sure, IF he wants to lick it off when he's done!    YUCK, ARGHHH!!!!!!! What a freaking LOSER.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	He might as well ... everybody else does.|`|sR6vhbataa	That's called Scat... and that's just Eeeeewwwwwww.    Some people get off on that stuff.    NOT ME!!!!|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Hmmm if you want to and are comfortable doing it then sure. Personally, I might vomit. Hey, maybe he likes that too! J/K Do whatever you feel comfortable with! Good luck!|`|tZ3jcxvjaa	Only if you live in Cleavland.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Please let this be a joke!! YUCK why don't you just s*** on him.|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Thats so sick. I have heard of it before and thought that was totally disgusting. If you ever fought or seperated, He would really get you with that one!|`|nAwLPHHNaa	NOOO, that's just wrong on a whole much of levels! and dirty.. there's actual 'bug's that live in feces. yuck! cant u guys come up with something else..lol
NUWdgQuraa	Hmm . . . it sounds like this chaos is the result of an unstable home life.  I would guess you have a controlling father.  I would bet he isn't that stable, lacks relationships with women his own age, and live vicariously through your success.    First thing you need to do is stop making music.  Please stop.  Then, you need to move out on your own.  Get emancipated.  Try to parlay your pop star career into a Playboy offer, at least 6-figures.  Finally, get off the Disney channel and stop brainwashing the youth of America.|`|SS1FFafRaa	Why wouldn't you tell them?    just tell them.
K6vEbdqxaa	Suuuuuurrrrreee ya are.
kUE3Ddktaa	Look for a dress with a V-neck, moderate straps, and an A-line skirt that hits just above the knee - this is one of the most universally flattering silhouettes.    But wait, someone might say, a V neck? Won't that be too much boobage? Answer - no, not if it fits properly. A V neck draws attention to the face and doesn't add bulk or horizontal lines to a large bust (horizontal lines make things look wider). A scoopneck will have a similar effect. The just-above-the-knee skirt will add a little height to the Bridesmaid 4, stay away from halters for Bridesmaid 2 (not good for broad shoulders, that's why you want a moderate strap. Also, so busty Bridesmaids 1 and 4 can wear normal supportive bras). My guess is that anything looks good on Bridesmaid 3, but if you pick a dress with a sash or defined waist, it will give her a waist and fake some curves. And if the sash or waistband is in the same color as the dress itself, it will keep the lines of the shorter, rounder women long and lean.    So, here's my pick - if you look for a dress in this style, it should be flattering to all four girls:    http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/WomenBro...    Something with a silhouette like these would also be a good choice:    http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/WomenBro...    http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/WomenBro...    http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/WomenBro...    http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/WomenBro...    I'm not trying to push J. Crew, since their dresses are expensive, but pay attention to the tailoring - the definition at the waist, the neckline that draws attention to the face, the drape of the skirt. As you look in different stores, look for those kinds of details.    As to color - let your conscience be your guide. There are lots of colors that would look good on all those girls. Maybe you need to think about color in the context of your overall wedding. Do you want it to be very formal - maybe jeweltones like plum, emerald green, or cobalt blue. Do you want it to be beachy and casual - maybe sky blue, grass green, or a medium pink. Stay away from yellows and yellow-greens - those are flattering on almost no one.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Gee - long, short; formal, informal; season?    http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3021645?Cate...  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3004397?Cate...    http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2988824?Cate...  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2997172?Cate...    http://www2.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Ite...  http://www2.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Ite...|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	There isn't any one style that looks flattering on all body types. Which is why there are so many different dress styles. Just pick a color (and a designer so that you don't have 10 different shades of pink or whatever) and have them wear whatever style is most flattering for them.|`|5d69a2b5acd5128b7f6ba155c12e4e78aa	A mu-mu will fit everyone the same!|`|Uy8ntukjaa	A princess style dress looks good on everyone. It should have a rounded or square front with a V that meets in the stomach and a bodice that accentuates the natural waist.

1H56FPt8aa	my mom left my family when I was 3. I tried to get a hold of her about 2 yrs ago and after a month of talking she basically told me to go **** myself and she didnt want anything to do with me|`|F47MyGDSaa	I talk to most people in my family. My dad's side however, they are the ones that tend to stop talking to people, but thankfully they're still talking to me.    My two sisters (they don't live in the same house anymore) try to avoid each other. My older sister always puts down my younger sister though, so I can see why.|`|EY0wnkh3aa	I talk to both my parents. I mean sometimes I get really mad at them and I threaten to never speak to them and blah blah, lol. But at the end of the day i can't help it and I think well no matter what they did to me, they're my parents. They brought me into this world, nurtured me, took care of me and I love them!!|`|J5Vjv3Qeaa	Cause my mother a plain striaght up *****, who looks for anything to yell at me. So I avoid and talk as little as possible to her.
K8OjmMUAaa	I had that problem myself, at the same age as you.     This is what worked for me...if she starts to change, just jump up and be like "I'm gonna go pee while you're doing that, be right back!" Dont be all fast and nervous, be cool, not obvious. And if you JUST peed don't go again lol just go and "get popcorn" or "turn the light in the other room off" or something like that, just have an excuse to "give her some privacy" ready.     Not only that, but if neither of you has changed and you're ready to, grab some clothes and go in the bathroom and tell her "I'm gonna go in here and change, be right back"....chances are, she'll take that opportunity to change while you're gone, either that or she'll follow your prompt and change when you get out of the bathroom.    And if you get caught looking, just look away and try to look mad and say something like "I'm sorry, I'm just so jealous. I wish mine were that size!"|`|GHpcc5iKaa	resist the temptation or just change in the bathroom to give her some privacy or something, the fact that your bi is none of her business quite frankly. you dont NEED to tell her you know. friends need boundaries too!|`|2TDtOdltaa	just walk out of the room anytime you see her changing and stuff like that.|`|hEReEQ5naa	how old are you? cause if you are younger then 15 then walk out of the room if you are older tell her|`|8bRxXlmFaa	Walk out of the room|`|FB28L6D5aa	She's close enough a friend to you to be staying over at your place, you probably should have told her you are bi. If she's a true friend she'll still be friends with you and feel comfortable enough to spend the night. Since she's already coming, you can either straight up tell her what's going on, or you can give her privacy while she changes.|`|jFfiNXbAaa	ewww  your not bi!  read the bible  jesus saves :)    and umm  just ewwww
vPkQpNQHaa	tell them no with a straight face
K8OjmMUAaa	You could tell your parents....but make sure that they understand that you do NOT want to be alone with them for a LONG time afterwards. Remind them that people who have been on drugs who suddenly can't have them anymore are likely to experience withdrawals. You could also mention that you don't trust their druggie friends either, and don't feel safe around any of them. Just be careful of retaliation until they're clean and all that stuff's out of their system.     If it were my kids, I'd want to know so I could get them help. Besides...if the cops show up one night while the three of you are at home, you'll get into trouble too just because you're there. AT least, that's the way it works here.     good luck:) You'll be doing the right thing if you tell. The right thing isn't always the easiest to do, but it's still right.|`|0fgQIfRtaa	ok i would tell but for their safty. because if your on drugs you could die and no one wants their brother or sister or anyone to die. your parents are also going to figure it out and think you where on drugs too since u did not tell.|`|yoE8cd5aaa	i would tell them then your parents can get them some help|`|OdTLUprzaa	You shouldn't be feeling guilty about someone else's problem.  And it IS a problem.  Tell your parents, and if it's scary to do that, you could ask them to not tell your sibilings how they found out.  Then help your bro and sis out and get back on track with school.
69qn7muFaa	Well, just try your hardest. I think it'd be more difficult for you than an 8th grader whose going to high school next year. (me)   You don't NEED to be the top of the class to get into a good college. i mean really, you see people who probably had a 30 on the ACT and they get into a state university and become famous.   It's just how you look at it.   My advice is: Just set goals. Like for me, my goal is to graduate high school in my junior year and then go to OU for college. See, my goals aren't as high as like going to Harvard and getting 100% on EVERYTHING.   Don't stress so much either, when you stress, you go nuts and you have no idea what to do.   Just enjoy your high school years. You can't go back, so you might as well make the best of it. Right? Just have fun.|`|d83eb00973f7bbcaa0e054814594bfd5aa	Find the reading list, and see how many you have read.  If you have missed some of the classics, read them.  Practice your writing skills; compare them to the SAT essays in SAT prep books.  They usually score the essays to give students examples.
MnFj47dxaa	No, it's not going to ruin your life!  While you're in high school everyone makes it seem like it's the most important time in your life, and if you don't take it seriously you're going to fail.  It's not true!  Yes, you should take it seriously, but not THIS seriously!  Just do what you can to keep your GPA up, go to summer school if you have to to make up the credits, and work hard the next two years.  You'll be just fine!|`|EMKuBql8aa	It's ok, it isn't going to ruin your life forever. Just try hard, Junior year is especially important for college.    It will be ok!!|`|S2FhDtfSaa	Take the class again as a regular chemistry class, get a solid A in it so it won't hurt your college admissions too much. Not every teacher is a fit with every student. I think you will be OK. Next time get some help when you don't understand something. The problem with getting good grades very easily is a person begins to think everything is within their grasp without study. As you see, this often is not the case. Just make sure it doesn't happen again.  Good luck|`|ZqhaMRFqaa	you still have next yr  and  dont give up hope  at least your in school try running your own business  you have it easy  dont sweat it too much deary you will be fine
X4UAMHhRaa	next time your gf is pooping in the bathroom, "accidentally" walk into her then make fun of how stinky her poop is. that way you'll both be even!|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Wear a bum-plug in traffic and bring an extra set of shorts with you.|`|oE77lovwaa	Accidents happen, and if she can't respect that and you, then is your time spent with her worth it? Sure make jokes and laugh, because you know if that happened to one of your friends it would be a laughing stock for awhile, but just accept it and move on.    So it's disgusting, and probably one of the most bizarre things I have ever heard but what does it matter?    I have more sympathy for you than your girlfriend, mostly because you were the one who had to sit in it the rest of the way home.|`|WlnnsGM5aa	You should go see a doctor. Maybe there is a medical reason this happened. That is awful. Make sure you use vinegar when you clean the seats.|`|idrRW9M7aa	HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA|`|AyGHEFJkaa	LOL!!!!!  She'll get over it|`|B56wTXSGaa	everytime she has her period from now on, humiliate her until she cries...and then laugh at her. it'll probably end your relationship, but you'll feel better about yourself.|`|9OVm1hL0aa	its cool man.. just laugh it off|`|Mwc1zdAdaa	You didn't really see me at Wal Mart did you?
HTrOwPSeaa	what's the question?    are they still together? if they are then it means something,   if not, then, i guess it depends. i had a friend that liked me and he's rich, but i just didnt like him like that, so idk. if i might have liked you, i would wish i gave you a chance.|`|AA10204048	are you trying to ask if you should talk to her? well it's worth a shot if you care, be careful just in case she's still with that guy, he seems violent....

If she means a lot to you, try.  Maybe something will happen.|`|mOBDEBDZaa	i would talk to her, don't let her know that you are rich. make everything okay again between you two (clear the air) and try and be yourself. if she likes you then, then maybe try and date her. if not, then it wasn't meant to be. don't show her that your rich because then if she is shallow, she will come to you only for your possessions and then possibly leave you.
kqa9VFrfaa	The bf is right. The spine is not a good place for other reasons too. Try an ankle.|`|VXQFT341aa	Trap Stamp. Hes right.|`|BqpRnSO5aa	Yep.  It is a Tramp Stamp.  If you're not a tramp, then don't do it.  Perhaps you would be better off not getting one?  If you want to be unique and still want one on your tailbone, then why not get one that says "Exit Only", just above your crack?    But, then again, I am not one for tattoos on women in the first place....

7G8jNBtiaa	I think at some point, all girls have had problems with parents/older guys, I certainly have. I think what you should do is tell your parents about him and tell them that they can meet him and make sure that they are okay with it because the only way you'll be able to hang out with his is if your parents are okay with it. Sneaking around is really hard to do, I've tried it. The best way is definitely to let your parents meet him.|`|7NPULrV6aa	go on a double and say "mom i want to have you permission to go on a date with 'johnny'.

Your parents have to let you out sometime -right? =) Gain your confidence    Hope that helped a bit.   x|`|Ki90Irkcaa	You could ask them but I wouldn't. If you have good parents they will tell you know. I have a 15 year old niece and I always talk to her about focusing on what matters, and while liking boys is normal and natural, 17 years old with a license is on a completely different level. You may look older, and you may come off as older in the way you act, but you don't want to bite off more than you can chew. I would just be cool with him at school and be friends, if you want to go to the movies, go in a group with some of your friends and his friends. But I don't think your parents will allow you to go on a date at 15 by yourself with a guy.|`|ftB3WY5Haa	just ask them. just go like "mom, i want to go out with this guy. he'll pick me up. there are other friends going too. well be home by ___"  it works, at least it always did for me.|`|X1cYBjyJaa	Just ask them! Be like-can i go the movies with my friend john?- answer any questions they have. You have nothing to hide so dont. Good Luck

VLKpfiTkaa	if ur a female- tell your father, then just dont talk to your step mom at all  if ur a male- tell her how it is|`|l8yfpyy1aa	She has an agenda of her own, and that's to bind your father to her so closely he'll never want to leave.  His children are mostly excess baggage.  They just distract her from her main mission.      Without even realizing it, teenage girls often rub adult women the wrong way.  There's something sarcastic in their tone of voice, something inappropriately sexy in their dress and actions, something unwilling about their helping around the house, that drives even real mothers crazy.  A stepmother is even more likely than a natural mother to tell her to sit down and shut up.     How to deal with this?  Well, pull in your horns.  Pretend she's one of your stricter teachers, or a boss with a temper.  If she barks at you, don't sass back, but just give her a long look, as if you can't believe she would speak to anybody like that, then do what she asked.     Occasionally she'll be in a more mellow mood.  That's when you can make a little conversation about a totally neutral topic.  One remark is probably enough -- you just want to appear sociable, not get into any kind of discussion.  Your dad will probably react positively to a nicer atmosphere around home, and she may pick up on that.    You're getting a front-row seat in the seminar on "How to Deal With Difficult People".  If you can navigate through this, you'll have a tremendous advantage out in the world later on.|`|ALvp7YRuaa	if i were you just cry when ever she talks to you and maybe she'll understand and fall for it. but dont use any violence because it's wrong..|`|GEyJMsaKaa	All I can tell you is to just ignore her when she is like that.Show her doesn't get to you.Answer her when she asks you a direct question.Do what she tells you to do.Just don't fight back because that will only make the problem worse.|`|vGH9ghiKaa	Is your last name Montana?|`|uPri5JEpaa	tell her to back off then tell ur father   and do the same over react as much as possible when she plays nice you can too|`|OfPSBAu5aa	If you seriously can't take it, talk to your father and ignore talking to her and dodge her as often as you can.    Personally, I would be blunt with her and question why she treats you differently.

Having people to talk to will be important, whether it's a teacher, minister, counselor or even someone like a crisis hotline.  Sometimes things work out over time but not always.     It's a shame that your dad isn't more useful, but unfortunately it's not unusual.    Do your best to stay strong and not blame yourself for things you cannot control, such as the sheer stupidity of others.

79eBn6V8aa	i think you have a couple more years before you should be overly concerned.  You could always do what i did and let the kids each have a room and you take the couch...it's crazy what us mommies will do for our children.|`|R3UC3HHgaa	I am also a divorced mother of two children.  My son is 14 and my daughter is 10.  We just recently moved from a rental house that gave them their own rooms into a more affordable 2 bedroom apartment where they now have to share a room.  I have them 3 1/2 days out of each week and I had to lie to the property owner and tell them that my daughter would be sleeping with me.  I do not understand why their must be guidelines and laws that state that siblings of the opposite sex cannot share a room in rental property yet when you purchase a home, no one is their to monitor who is sleeping in their own rooms and who is sharing.  My children were 6 and 10 when I divorced and its been a tough road for me too.  My ex got the house and I gave up my rights to child support.  Stupid Me!  All I can tell you is that if you have an open and honest relationship with your children that must believe it will all work out.  Thats what I do.  As I said, my children are once again having to share a room.  It's only been 4 months but it's actually working out pretty good.  I do believe at some point this will have to stop but my children know the boundries and privacy that each one needs. We make it work because we have too.  You sound like a good mother so quit beating yourself up over this.  I know what a lot of people might say, but if you've raised them right and continue to do so, then them sharing a room should be the least of your worries.  I don't know of any programs out there for single mothers on a tight budget but check into your local SRS.  They do have services available to women or may be able to point you in the right direction.  Also see if there is a local YWCA chapter in your area.  Best of luck.  Your doing fine.    Love Kansas City|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I notice you didn't offer to give up your room to one of them. You could put up a divider in the largest bedroom and you and your daughter could share that room. Or you could give them the bedroooms and figure out how to make a private area for yourself in the living room.    I don't see how letting your son have his own room while you bunk up with your daughter would in any way alienate him. Most kids would love to have their own room all to themself. He is old enough to understand if you explain that now that he is older, changes need to be made.     You could also see if your husband can fork over enough $$ to provide a 3-bedroom something, somewhere. Take him back to court, if necessary.     As a last resort, you could check out social services to see if they can help you find a place you can afford.|`|mCUNl9Wgaa	I know that not having been in your situation I may not have the best advice...But you could always get a room divider. Or hang curtains between sides of the room. In a sense that "partitions" the room.|`|0d4X54rMaa	you have two bedrooms.. give each one their own   and you treat the living room like you have a studio   and sleep in the living room with your bed in a corner  you can do it and make it work|`|81wvN8Rraa	You could move to the living room or you could move your daughter into your room but not your bed.

UtYOwE4Laa	i'm not going to read that but my  1 tip is don't be nervous and feel around new people as you feel around your closest friends.|`|l8yfpyy1aa	This is a problem that I also faced when I was in my twenties.     Now that I'm a lot older, I've found that getting involved in shared activities is a good way to get to know people.  When they've made a commitment to be there, such as a choral group, an art class, or a bowling team, folks are thrown together and conversation follows naturally.  They're there to expand their horizons too.    After that, you have to be a little proactive. You can't always wait to be asked, but need to do some specific asking.  Say something like, "I'm going shopping for clothes in (nearby city) on Saturday.  Would you like to come along?" or (to a co-worker) "Let's go out for lunch together tomorrow.  I'll be happy to drive."     When you like another person, and show sincere but quiet interest in what they say, that's a good start to a friendship.  Most friendships stay in the casual stage -- if one in twenty becomes deeper, you're doing well.  Some people who want to make friends too quickly are needy or a little bit weird.  That's not you, so it's OK for you to go more slowly.|`|T9io7k8aaa	Well the best way to make friends is to smile. At everyone. Even complete strangers who pass you by. Eventually when they do get to know you they'll see you as a friendly person.     Don't rely on the same few people you talk to at work/school to be your best friends make a ride range of aquaintances and I'm sure you'll hit if off with a few people (:|`|EuhWXJgiaa	ii'm good at it but there is no person in this earth i thinkl that gets me and is kinda like me but i have many friends wona be friends ?|`|eLINxkIZaa	well, I had this problem two so maybe if your boyfriends friends have a girlfriend you could make friends with them?|`|iR1tSzsoaa	Start with a normal "Hello" then all will fall into place hopefully!           Good Luck
EuhWXJgiaa	do this only if you know your friend can take jokes and won't be mad so when the person is slleap go get a toothpaste and covere it all up in her/his face and make sure to ricorde hope she/he won't be mad cause my friend was mad !
brEa9fFDaa	OK well did you do something that may have upset her?     ask her about it.     maybe she invited somebody that doesnt like you....but yes I believe you have the right to be mad because she could have at least told you that she was having a party and told you why you werent invited.  she shouldnt exclude you from a party when your others friends are ther as well.   so no..your not wrong to be mad at her...but talk to her and see what she has to say|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	no your not wrong, but before you get too upset just ask her why she didnt invite you.|`|357BF35maa	no because she should have told you especially since you were really nice. confront her and tell her that you really didn't appreciate not being invited. if you guys are real close friends and she says (after you confronyt her) that she could only invite a certain amount of people then she purposely didnt WANT to invite you.|`|jFfiNXbAaa	ha no  she's obviously not your friend  and your just her pity friend  no offence  you might be a freak idk  mean girls in high school   get used to it

Please read this excerpt of an adulterous affair at work for your enjoyment:    Workplace Romance Drives Loving Wife to Adultery  March 18, 2008       Written By: Woman - 29 - Straight - Baltimore, Maryland    Im so confused. I love my husband so much and now Ive cheated on him. I didnt mean for this to happen. This man I work with and I just hit it off from day one. He started at my workplace a year ago. From his first day, we were like soul mates. Every day I looked forward to going to work so I could see him. At first I never thought it would turn into anything more. But the feeling got more and more intense as time went on. Wed been friends for almost a year when this man started hinting in emails that he was in love with me. Hes married, too, so I just thought he was having problems at home and was turning to me out of lonliness or something. But he kept being more and more direct. At first I told him he had to stop. But he kept pushing and pushing until I realized that he really does love me. I was so overwhelmed. It just started out as kissing. All the physical things started slow also. But then had sex at a motel. I felt so sleazy after we did it. He was suddenly cold to me, and I wondered if he was lying all along just to get some sex. But he explained later that he was just upset that I was going to go back to my husband. I know I have to stop this but now it has happened three times. This man is acting all crazy and my husband is getting suspicious. I feel like I cant stop it. I dont know what to do.      Judge the Cheater!

I worked at a factory and I couldnt believe some of the things I heard and saw that married ppl do. But honestly if they are gonna cheat they would have done it anywhere.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	It's very common - but, having said that, if a spouse is going to cheat, they will find a way to do so anywhere and everywhere.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	VERY. Trust me on that one.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Very common. You spend 8 hours a day with the same person, always looking your best at work and on your best behavior it could lead to some kind of a deranged relationship if your weak and have bad character.    We need to get those women out of the work place and back home so the divorce rate will go down.    Just kidding! Don't flip out! It was only a joke!|`|79eBn6V8aa	well...i think it's common..and yes they will cheat...of course not everyone but yes it happens...co-workers often see each other more than they see their families so people often flirt and stuff to pass the time.  This often escalates into something more.|`|WItKOQh7aa	It usually happens there, because people who work together spend so much time together.
ZaQ6iQWMaa	I think it's a pathetic attempt to get in the news, personally. The whole story is sad, and she sure as hell shouldn't have cheated. She was way in the wrong. But what could he possibly do with it if he got it back? Put it back in?  Silly, sad, and heartbreaking. It's amazing what people do.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	indian giver|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	I laughed at first, but after I thought about it...I'd be pissed too.  You love someone enough to do that for them...then they DON'T love you enough to be true...she is a whore of the worst kind.  Cheaters are assholes.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	He asked for either the kidney, or money that equaled the amount of the kidney lol.     It's an interesting way to do it. I think in his situation it was reasonable. He had major surgery in order to save her life and she cheated on him! What a terrible woman!|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Hilarious, Bella.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	I say right on.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I can see why he would, but he did it because he loved her. It's sad she'd do that to him, but it was a wonderful thing he chose to do. Revenge is never the answer,but it's nice to think about sometimes. HA!|`|WlnnsGM5aa	Can you blame him? I mean, it is a ridiculous request, and selfish, but she cheated!|`|81wvN8Rraa	He's a looser. It was a gift and just b/c they aren't together anymore  doesn't change that. He should just get over it.|`|QClFoSNhaa	I think if she never loved him she shouldnt have let him give her a kidney. He was a very generous man and will be blessed for it. Even though he lost his kidney and his wife in the long run god will bless his generosity.     I think she is a selfish person she knew she didnt love him when she took it. So I think she should give it back if thats possible.|`|9a734c12c8a5bcbcb7f973ccdc4ed0eaaa	"asked" if that happened to me, I'd get a razor knife and some duct tape and "take" my kidney back from that b*tch

First get happy, and Jesus is the Lord of all comfort and joy  then let this boy/guy thing take course,   when you are ready and strong.      gotta get strong girl,   cause' life chucks some big guns, and you gotta get through it.  obviously Jesus will help you not to become a bitter and broken woman.;

Parents are nowhere around, and there are many students of a similar age.  You're just meeting the Average Horny Guy who wants to try out his so-called magnetic appeal.  It reminds me of an ancient joke:    Younger brother:  "Hey bro, how can I get a girl to go to bed with me?"  Older brother:  "Every girl you meet, ask her!"  Younger brother: "But that'll get me slugged!"  Older brother:  "Sure -- ninety-nine times out of a hundred ..."     The fact that you're "fairly average looking" is part of this situation.  The raving beauties don't get propositioned except by the Big Men On Campus, because other guys figure that those girls can always pick and choose.  The fat and ugly ones never get propositioned because guys don't want to be seen with them.  You're right in the target zone!     Make it real clear that you're not a hot little slut.  If you even once give that impression, your reputation will be trash in an instant.  Double date.  Do things on campus rather than driving away somewhere.  Things will sort themselves out soon enough.  The girls will know who the wolves are, and the decent guys will know who the nice girls are.  Meanwhile, keep tuned in to the grapevine yourself.
FzBk7OxBaa	shes not being nice so u dont have to be nice to her.   just tell her to relax. that its not fun having to listen to her all day and if she thinks u complain tell her to listen to her self once in a while/|`|DaMfwYpXaa	Dont like her hey email me babe|`|vPkQpNQHaa	i had a friend just like that and i just stopped talking to her because she wasn't worth it   you could always find a better friend or tell her how you feel just straight out face to face|`|AA11330914	k first off, with u saying like so much it makes it sound like whining. just tell her flat out how u feel.without saying like so much. tell her u need someone to talk to sometimes just like she does and a lot of the time the things she needs to talk about seem more like complaining but u dont rant about it on facebook u just listen like u shud cuz ur best friends. and tell her to stop being so f u c k i n g immature as to do something like that. just not in that way lol..  good luck :]
AA10540570	the reason he's unhappy is- basically because men are STUPID!! lol.  But seriously- the 10% you're talking about is he genuinely sorry or is he just saying srry cause you  bit*  at him so he just says it? Cause if he's really sorry then he probably has some issues going on. Since I don't know you personally I can't say for  sure. But men stray SO easily and if he's not happy & you're not happy-it's time to make some changes! Changes that make u both happy. Whatever that means-it may mean counseling, it may mean you both get some tolerance for each other's problems with the relationshi[-or it may mean getting away fromeach other. Obviously you care enough to at least try or else you wouldn't have typed this on here to get advice.  Don't let money be the reason you stay unhappy though!  Good luck!|`|GWRP3vLQaa	He may not go to counseling, but perhaps you should go anyway as it might help you and the kids to have that extra support and unbiased advice.     If you leave and file for divorce, he will have to pay child support, and if you move in with your mother (assuming she would like that) you could help her with expenses and pay for child care, and get a job. It will be rough, but you will be getting a new start. In time you can get your own place and get back on your feet.    From what you say, it doesn't sound like your husband will change his ways for the long term. I really wish you well and hope things turn out for you. You sound like a really nice person.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Honestly I would have him read your post, your kind considerate and obviously love him. Your not demeaning, calling names here your just asking a very reasonable question. Id say print this out and leave it on the kitchen table. Or make a new post, and add into it for further value. I am sitting here in tears my marraige unfolding and I dont want it too or something like that, try to pull at his heart strings, you might be able too. If not, try to leave ona  positive note, maybe move in and share expenses with mom. Take care,  been there, its no fun|`|81wvN8Rraa	Move on.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Tell him what's going on before you leave. Make him realize that if there is no change soon he will lose you, and he may come around. Tell him that if he wants a marriage he needs to try harder to make you happy. That's his responsibility as your husband- to put YOU and the kids first. Tell him that otherwise you will be leaving.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	Not enough of the whole story here to give a definitive answer. What brought you close together in the early stages of dating, prior to marriage? What made you fall in love? Try to recreate in a different form  those events. I am not prying here but sometimes women that have children may gain wgt. and not be as attractive to their partner. And your husband as well. Try to go to the gym together if this is an issue. Do things together besides this to have one on one time. I would also convey your feelings to your husband and promote what I stated to try and get things back on track.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I would definitly let him know that couples counseling is your last resort. Have you ever said the word "divorce" to him before? Maybe he just doesn't get how serious it is. Tell him that if he says not to counseling, he is saying yes to divorce. You are not giving an ultimatum just letting him know that you will both continue to be miserable and eventually it will simply end. I wouldn't stay together for the kids, they wont be happy. Kids always find ways to blame themselves for problems with their parents so all the negativity will get to them eventually. Also, it sucks to feel trapped. I'm sure there are state programs that will help pay for daycare. Or maybe you can work opposite shifts with your mom so she can babysit. There are options but I would try my hardest to make it work first. I really hope it all works out for you. Good luck!|`|4LsF70cjaa	You sound like me!  I stayed because I knew that I couldn't support the three kids even though he was often between jobs.  After more than 30 years I thought it was finally "our" turn.  I was almost right.  He decided he would rather be with someone that he met on the internet.  I wish that I had been stronger!  I could have found some way and there is a lot of government assistance out there now that was not there then.  If I had had those options, I would not now be alone at a time in my life when I should be thinking about retiring instead of job hunting.  By the way, only one of the three kids will speak to him and that one only talks to him if his dad calls him.
vBkGGYJSaa	it is your life, you have to live it the best way that you feel you can.  you will be 18 and your mother can not tell you what you can do when you move out.  you have to trust in yourself and your feelings.  remember it is your life and you have to live it the best way that you can.  no one can tell you how to live your life for the better, because only you have all the information that you need to make your decessions for your future.  people can give you suggestions, but you have to decide how to use these suggestions.|`|yjvBnW71aa	dont listen to your mom she cant tell you who to like. obviously this guy is perfect for u. give it a shot!
97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	explain to her that you thought you two were best friends, then if she says  "we are" then say "why dont you treat me like it" then when she says " what are you talking about" give her a few examples about what she does , for example :blowing you off and treating other friends better than you. just get it out and explain to her how it hurts you.    good luck!|`|357BF35maa	this is kinda the same situation with me. me and my friend were so close we could be called conjoined twins. when she started hanging out with her worst enemy from a year ago they became best friends and now she wont tell me anything and never talks to me or even says hi... its kinda upsetting cause it was like in the blink of an eye she was gone.|`|aa1b714111411c497a6d36c7701a1d23aa	Talk to her about it, tell her that you feel like she has abandoned you.

And explain how you feel and if she wants to stay friends.|`|vPkQpNQHaa	talk to her alone without those girls|`|Amnjqfk0aa	you can, nothing in the ordinary is impossible, maybe you just grew apart or maybe she dosnt like you but just ask her, if you were friends it could happen again
p3AbTmbfaa	First you went from you thinking your wife is having an affair and then to the rusting bumper on the car. Exactly what are you asking ? Was your wife cheating on you with your rusty bumper ? By any means, stop being cheap and hire a private eye for 200. They will get you pictures and confirm or deny your suspicions|`|GWRP3vLQaa	LMAO.

It's probably rusted under the paint already and just painting over it won't help because it will eventually rust out from the inside.  If you want it done properly, you'll need to sand down the area that's rusted until you get to bare metal.  If it's rusted through the metal, then you'll need to replace the whole fender and have it repainted.  Just go to a body shop and get a quote first to see how much it will cost.  If it's out of your budget, then you'll just have to wait until you find out your wife really is cheating on you and blackmail her to fix the car or you'll divorce her.|`|H2bpuDsKaa	hahahaha!.......a "trolly" funny question........|`|EdBCksSwaa	Feeble attempt friend,but It looks like your troll worked,look at all of the responses.

His parents give him a book about acceptable sexual practices in marriage .It is sad.

ZaQ6iQWMaa	Let me put it to you from my experience - I would rather have him yelling at a radio than barhopping with friends and never calling me and then showing up at home at 4am every single Friday.  That's what happened to me.    Be thankful he's there. I suggest reading or using headphones or something to drown him out. But go in there and give him a kiss every once in a while. Believe me, he'll appreciate it.|`|encb0jc2aa	OCD|`|NWH3MnE9aa	It is not normal. He's an idiot. Sorry.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	yeah it's normal he has a hobby and something he looks forward to man I remember those days. I used to as well on this one radio station until they had taken it off. If you think about it it's not that much different than waiting all week for your favorite tv show to come on and then watching it.|`|iD4ejChZaa	wow kinda crazy-seriously i wouldn't mind.|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Lol yeah that's weird and it would get on my nerves too, But I guess thats just part of his routine. Just let him know it kinda bugs you and ask him to listen in the other room?|`|SK7MxFTnaa	Well why don't you make yourself more interesting than the radio, and yell OH YEAH for him...with joint participation of course.      I bet the radio disappears.|`|AARZV2v0aa	well ya. But consider this at least he's not out cheating on you, or have a worse habit!|`|th7C1aoaaa	a few times yes. not every friday.|`|0d4X54rMaa	yea he is nuts  so are most husbands in one way or another    good luck with yours lol|`|81wvN8Rraa	Probably but it sounds harmless enough. You should agree to let him have his own time to listen to the radio.|`|MyzkHJLraa	Well it could be worse! Be thankful he is at home and not out bar hopping running around with other women.|`|5HoZ3NHeaa	Yes it is normal when a husband's wife has a fiance. Check your other questions. Probably hoping you will leave him for the other guy.|`|6968edcfce3f93906cc4292ced3d0ee4aa	LoL your hubby is funny!  yeah I guess its normal..it's his hobby every Friday.   Come up with something to do for yourself on Friday that way you won't be bored!

Good luck.|`|f0be5ef8a3135442891ea00c6595dc04aa	First of all since there an riff now,just keep your mouth close about anything when talking to both parties.Any way it sound so juvenile.Seems to me you the cause of the riff anyway.Some time it better to be quiet and don't tell every thing to folks,because one day it will come back and bite you in the wazoo.|`|RPIVHQX5aa	dont do anything
3y0w1qIBaa	High school changes people.  If you really value your friendship with her, apologize to her face to face to whatever you may have done to her (even though that you didn't do anything that would offend her).  If she refuses, the most important part is that you surrendered yourself rather than carrying the regret for the rest of your life.|`|LN8ZlcbPaa	Seems like she's been holding on to   this conflict for a time, by being direct  you have already done your part.  But you can try again.    Think of your past relationship,  what were your most common problems?  Perhaps it can give you some hints.

AA10065812	AS A REMINDER TO ALL SINGLE MEN SHACKING UP WITH A WOMAN.  UNLESS YOU LIVE IN ARIZONA OR CALIFORNIA, YOU HAVE   NO (English/Spanish/Italian);  N-O;  NEE (Dutch);  ?? (Arabic);  He (Bulgarian);   (Japanese);  ASSUMED RIGHTS TO, OR SAY ABOUT, ANY CHILD BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK.  ONLY THE COURTS CAN GRANT YOU ANY RIGHTS.    I REPEAT, SINGLE FATHERS IN 97% OF THE U.S. AND ITS TERRITORIES HAVE NO RIGHTS.   YOU ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE, BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNTIL YOU ARE GRANTED THEM.  SINGLE MEN MAKE THESELVES INTO A SLAVE CLASS THAT MUST ASK PERMISSION OF THEIR SLAVE OWNER (THE MOTHER) OR HER LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE (THE COURTS) FOR PERMISSION TO SEE YOUR CHILD.  AND EVEN THAN, 60% OF THE TIME, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT STUDIES, YOU WILL BE DENIED ACCESS TO YOUR CHILD, LOSING ALL CONTACT WITHIN FIVE YEARS.    YOU SOLD YOURSELF INTO SLAVERY THE MOMENT YOU TOOK YOUR PECKER OUT OF YOUR PANTS WITH A WOMAN YOU WERE NOT MARRIED TO.      I've worked with divorced and single fathers for 20 years.      You have an up mountain, not hill, battle ahead of you.  In a word, prepare, prepare, prepare.    Get an order enter forcing a DNA test, unless one has already been done.    If one has been done, go to the child support enforcement to setup a voluntary order.  Wait for them to file against you will result in you paying all court costs.      Take a certified parenting course.  The court is going to order you to take it anyway, so by showing youve taken it only looks good to them.    Start keeping a daily journal of all you activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      The court will order you into mediation, so take the lead first.  Instead of hiring attorneys, go to a mediator and try to hammer out an agreement.  A mediator is an attorney or paralegal with certified training as a mediator.  You each have to pay half the fees in order for the mediator to have the appearance of being unbiased.    If you and the mother are civil, consider Bird Nest Custody.  In this the child lives in one home and each parent live there for 3-4 weeks, than switch.  You live with friends, family, rent a room, etc. on the off time.  In this manner, your childs life is not disrupted.  They are not being shifted back and forth.  They keep their own room, friends, school, etc.  It is hard on the parents, but than the child comes first.  This is the form of custody rocker Ted Nugent had.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...|`|DjircW6waa	In America, it is not assumed that a child is better off with a married couple.  If you haven't been around for the child the last three years, your chances aren't good.  Why would you want to take a child away from the only parent he's ever known?  It sounds like you care more about your own ego than the child's well-being. Unless the kid's mother is abusive, in jail, or on drugs, you have no shot in HE&  of getting custody of this child.  Have you considered just trying for visitation rights?|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Sir, I hate to break this news to you, but you will not be able to take your son from his mother. In America, most family courts utilize the "tender years" doctrine, and automatically award physical custody of children six and under to the mother. Barring proof that the mother is a prostitute, drug addict, alcoholic or othewise puts the child in danger, you will not be able to establish sufficient grounds to take custody.    If you wanted to marry to be able to stay in America, I can't say that I blame her for saying no. How do you know that there is no father figure in the child's life? Is his maternal grandfather deceased without any biological uncles? It seems like you hold the fact that she is still single against her, which a court may not agree with. Plenty of single mothers have raised kids who turned out much better than kids from two parent households.    Have you been making steady child support payments since being deported? It doesn't seem like you have direct communication, so you may not be paying support. This is your primary obligation to your son.    I suggest that you voluntarily terminate your parental rights so that your son's mother can marry a man who can adopt the child. Your life is in South Africa with your wife and child. Leave this child and his mother be. As detrimental as atheism is, courts don't look at it that way.|`|nE5GfCumaa	My friend it is not so easy to do... You gave up that right in the US when you lost your visa.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Go 2 court.  Not Judge Judy.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	In America, being an atheist, or unwed, doesn  Let's face it, you don't stand much chance of getting custody of the child.|`|3iPqpbDzaa	That will be difficult. If the child is borne in the US it's considered it's natural habitat. US does not easily have children leave the country.  To try to start the process you might first need to contact a lawyer then confirm you are the father.  If she is married or not doesnt count, it's more about the laws and if she is a fit parent.

You should block his number.  He obviously knows your friends (too well) and they would probably give him your new number if he sweet-talked them.  If you can't even trust them to keep their legs closed you definitely can't trust them to keep their lips closed about that  .    Don't take him back....don't read his texts...don't hook up with someone else to piss him off (you didn't mention it, but a lot of my friends make that mistake when they get cheated on) ...don't murder him...(if you really have to...remember it took two...kill your best friend while you're at it)      ...and Don't take the last part seriously.
UE6F9L6maa	If it is indeed an open marriage no he would not have a problem with it. Most men in open marriage just want someone to come home to, be their friend, make an appearance for friends family and work associates and do chores.

For one thing it makes breaking up a lot harder, it also says to all your friends and family that you are willing to make a legal commitment to each other. Essentially it is up to the two people involved and what makes both of them comfortable and happy>|`|NWH3MnE9aa	It's an outstanding idea. People who don't get to know each other before marriage are asking for trouble.|`|AA10726533	Some don't agree with it because that isn't the "traditional" thing to do. Although, there are very few traditional relationships now. People are having sex with them before knowing their flaws. They the infatuation grows so big, they feel as if they are in love and it isn't love at all.  So, i would say that a couple deciding to just try things out, to see the good, the bad, and the ugly, would be a good idea.   Divorce statistics are so high now, if people would just think about the person that they are considering marrying, i think it all works out better in the end.|`|00DBSvS6aa	Great idea it gives each a chance to learn if they can share effectively|`|ZaQ6iQWMaa	I'm living with my other half right now, and we don't plan on marrying for a while, if at all.

8nGZV6ufaa	No, it shouldn't make the right lady shy away...especially based on the reason for the 5 kids, the reason for the divorce, and the situation your in.  The right person will accept those 5 children without reservation, and see them as an extension of you...Those that don't do that, or seem to cannot do that, are pretty shallow, and be glad they shy away.

Children are a part of their parents lives, and need attention, the more children you have the more likely that their will be complications that will come up in a relationship, I personally never dated nor married  a man with kids, as this is my personal decision, however I don't think less or put out bad vibes for others who make this choice. It's all about choices.|`|iD4ejChZaa	I understand all you wrote, but a man who has 5 kids and lives with his parents? no, they are not judging you as a person they just don't want that for their future. That is their perogative. Only a wealthy doctor or lawyer could get away with that. Then again, you may meet someone.    Most women still want security, even if they have a good career now they don't want to have to work at 45, so YOUR kids can all go to college.|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Yes, That would turn me away, Because looking at the future, You'd never have much money left.|`|AA10065812	How about dating your children's mother?  Start over and find again what you had that generated those kids.      No sleeping together, no touchy feely.  Take the kids along as chaperons.     They deserve two parents in the home.  Over 85% of children without their parents in the home develop behavioral problems.   That means four of your five kids are going to suffer from your decision.    Only this time, consider marrying her.|`|00DBSvS6aa	if it turns them away you are lucky. One needs to be responsible and the other should want to share in all things of life|`|QClFoSNhaa	Not to be mean but if you had five kids and was paying child support on them it would be a turn off I would assume that you would never be able to help pay the bills. This day and time you almost have to have 2 incomes to survive. I dont know what you make but i'm sure you pay a chunk of support. Just always be honest and you will find someone. There are lots of women who cant have children who would love to step in and be a step-mom|`|wstb99hdaa	As long as you take care of them I would not have a problem dating you.  I dated a guy with 6 and he was active in his kids life.  I have 2 kids myself so I think it someone has kids already would be more accepting.|`|ZaQ6iQWMaa	I'm sure you are a decent guy, but you gotta think about the shoe being on the other foot. How would YOU feel if a woman told you she had 5 kids from a previous marriage?    Honestly, you need to concentrate on you and getting your life in order before you share one with someone. I don't think being with someone is impossible for you, but you need to focus on you and your kids.|`|vOUDHws3aa	Ok, so I'm assuming you came here for an honest answer and not a "if your children scare them off, you don't need them anyway" kind of answer, so here it is from MY standpoint:    How in the world would I be able to become seriously involved with someone who  a) will probably not want to have anymore more children  b) who can't afford to live on his own  c) whose parents I have to see whenever we hang out at "his" place-- kinda makes you feel like a teenager  d) who doesn't really seem to be over his ex...    In my opinion, you sound like a really nice guy, with a huge and thankful heart, but it really doesn't seem like you are over her    i.e. "My ex is the one that decided that the relationship needed to end for whatever reason. To this day I'm still not exactly all that sure why it ended. I do know that she had met someone before the end though and that she wanted to be with him."    I think that more than anything is what is keeping you from successfully moving on with another woman. I would no doubt be intimidated by five children and the financial burden that would place on a potential partner but I'm pretty sure I could get past all of that and the other things listed above if I felt like he was more into me than his ex.|`|J4W68owgaa	1.) 5 kids is scary, even if they are biologically our children...lol    2.) You live with your parents. That's a bad sign.    3.) Your kids live 1200 miles away so how often do you see them? That translates into deadbeat bad dad.    4.) You are paying child support for 5 children, how can you be financially stable?      There are SO many red flags about you that most women aren't willing to look past. I'm not saying it's right and you may very well be a great guy in a bad situation, but upon first glance, I'd look for someone with less baggage and complications.    To help it, maybe just lay it all out there. Tell the women the story, your ex decided she didn't want to be married anymore, she moved away with the kids for xyz reason, and just lay it all out there. Let them know you understand if they don't want to deal with it, but just be up front and honest about it. Also, let them know what you are doing to improve the situation.    Good luck|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Child support for 5 kids is a chunk of change, I'm sure. You mentioned that you have moved back in with your parents. It might be practical for you right now, but I am sure that a lot of women wonder if you will actually be able to get back on your feet financially.    Many women who are young enough to still want to have a baby of their own might wonder if you will ever want to have a child with them since you already have 5 kids, or if you can afford to support another family.     I guess right now I'd say you should work very hard to get back on your feet and into your own home, keep dating and don't get discouraged. Hopefully, you will meet a nice gal and things will work out for you. Good luck.    You may wonder why the kids have to enter the picture, but the cold hard fact is, you aren't just another single guy. You are a father, and unless the women you are seeing are just looking for someone to date and nothing more, the kids are a big factor to consider.|`|HvnFTNmCaa	Just meet up with single mothers who are also divorced, they will understand and relate.     I only have one kid, but I understand how you feel, I got my divorce last month.    I have met the most wonderful girl, you will too..
ZaQ6iQWMaa	I think you should seek counseling. I think it will help you comes to terms with what is really bothering you, because I think this stems from low self-esteem.  You should leave those things in the past. He chose you. I'm not saying his exploits were ok, but the fact of the matter is that he's apparently gotten over all of it because he chose you, and married you.    But until you feel better about yourself, you can't move on. Perhaps you guys should try counseling together, but I definitely recommend it for you.|`|4POGapREaa	No there is no logic behind your jealousy & yes it is insecurity.  You need to seriously take stock of what you have & stop trying to turn your good life into misery.  It is a choice, you know?  I used to be the same as you but I've grown a lot since then.  You are totally correct in worrying that it could destroy your relationship.  People want to be judged on their present actions & it gets really tiring defending yourself over something that you're not even currently doing & haven't done in ages.  Exhausting, in fact.    People change a lot over the course of 13 yrs & I'd bet that some of those women are very embarrassed to think that you might know what they were like back in the day & that they were the type that had one night stands.  I have absolutely zero clue how many women my husband has been with & I'm fine with that.  He doesn't know my number either.  It makes no difference to our lives so why even go there?  I would hate to be raked over the coals for my past behavior because it wasn't always so ladylike, let me tell you.  But I'm a grown woman, I'm married, I love my husband, I'm not entirely proud of everything I've done but it's done & it's history.|`|AA10025824	It's insecurity.  But I think you'll sort of "burn" it off.  You'll get sick of the feeling and it will gradually go away.  As long as something new doesn't spark it up again.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	You are acting incredibly stupidly- and you will drive him away if you keep it up. Seek counseling--what you are feeling is immature and foolish, and I guarantee he will leave if you don't get a grip.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	I honestly think Jealously stems from your own insecurities. Dont look at him for the answers look into yourself.|`|zDmGngXVaa	Your husbands past is his past, your past is your past! What you both have now and what you have shared between the years together is all you should be thinking about. And seeing his ex's you should be thinking in your mind "nana i got the man you had for one night for the rest of my life!" Make a laughing joke about it. I do! My husband has ex's and a past but I don't get jealous! No need to because I am the one he asked to marry, I am the one he kisses, I am the one he sleeps with at night! I am his wife, his lover and his best friend! I know when we go out once in awhile we will run into one or 2 of his ex's and they will tell me that I am a lucky woman to have such man! And I tell myself "I know, to bad you messed up on him! :D" One of his ex's is dating my brother, it don't bother me! The only time I would get bothered is if his ex's would try and make a problem! You should just be glad that you have him and not them!|`|RVicFEyFaa	It could be all of the above & a control issue. Is there something your neglecting to do to move forward with another issue in your life. Are you bored these days. Is life geared around raising the kids & time mostly spent with family w/o much for yourself. Do you work outside the home or have friends of your own or mutual friends? It's daunting being a mom & wife w/o an outside stimuli. Some counseling never hurts, nor does a hobby. About the other women, live & let live. But if this is turning into an anxiety that you can't control you would benefit from therapy. It might also help to have your husband join in, you don't always want to hear a pat answer to your fears or what suits you or him best when brought up. If this is more then a slight paranoia or mention between you, get to the heart of the matter.|`|evJ2GEodaa	It's normal to be jealous when you think about your husband being with another person physically even if it is in the past. Seeing these women is a constant reminder of it as well. Just know that your husband is with you and that all of that is in the past and he only wants to be with you and no one else.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	Hey get your head out of your you know what!  We all have a past - you had sex with another man and got pregnant by him!  You are allowing these thoughts to poison your brain - stop it!  You are obviously getting some pay off for this behavior, maybe your husband is paying you extra attention or trying to alleviate your fears but he will get sick of it one day.  When you see these other women in the store ect you should be thinking that he MARRIED ME not that she has seen his ding dong!  HE MARRIED YOU!!!!|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You have to learn a way to stop doing this, it will definitely tear your relationship apart. It is very destructive and accomplishes nothing. You cannot change the past and dwelling on it is very unhealthy. Get counseling, there may be something else bothering you that you aren't aware of.|`|AA12272885	I really have no idea why this has erupted after so many years. It isn't, as you said, reasonable at all.  He left his wicked ways behind and chose you as his wife, he reassures you and tells you he loves you, and still you persist in your resentment of his past sexual exploits.  So what if these "other" girls are out there somewhere?  He is still with you.      I do think you need to see your doctor and tell him you are having obsessive thoughts and they are dragging you down. Maybe he can recommend someone for you to talk to, or offer other solutions.|`|hcgaizJCaa	See, this is why i do not agree with "full disclosure". You know things that you should not know.     First, there is a 7-year age difference so it's completely unfair to fret over you being 9 when he got laid the first time. He was 16! He obviously wasn't your first, since you have a child, so how can you be upset over his past? I think it's perfectly normal to get a little miffed when you see one of the women, but you have been married 13 years! This may be one of those things that you have to make a conscious decision to ignore. Who gives a rat's *** if he slept with some random girl ONE TIME over 13 years ago? He sleeps with you every damn nite.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	I'm in the same situation as you, well, except for the being upset about his past part. I live in a small town, the town he grew up in where everyone knows everything he ever did. I guess his past just doesn't bother me. He had a chance with all those other people and moved on until he found me, then quit moving. Maybe if you can think of that. But, you are right, you will cause trouble by dwelling on something you have absolutely no control over, and something that he did not do to you "on purpose" or anything. What he did the past is just part of growing up. He's a grown up now and is chosing to be with you. Be happy in that.|`|00DBSvS6aa	The past is the past and we have no right to judge others for their past events that were normal. Plus we must not dwell on the past or there is no future for us. Live today for tomorrow and let the past be and be forgotten. Heavens imagine if God never forgave us for all of the things in our life, every unkind word or act. Tomorrow is the first day of your life and you must be positive and take the day with an open heart
YEC4Zilraa	your image isnt a big deal. its called SELF esteem. if you have low SELF esteem then its your fault you feel low. never regret anything in your life.ever your who you are. so wat a few pictures got out big deal. lifes fun so live it like its your last.|`|AA11108018	You have your life back it was hard lesson to learn..

8vwEWq2Zaa	Im idk. Maybe try going with something that you have always asked yourself. ;P  Thanx for
VXQFT341aa	Gee I feel bad for you. You mom needs to realize she is an alcoholic before any type of treatment will help. Maybe if she sees that she may lose her family she will except that she has a problem and try to recover. Hopefully she will see this. But being forced into treatment when a person doesn't feel they have a problem never works. Maybe you can go to counseling with her to get her involved. I hope this helps and I'll be praying for you and your family.
NvW6voPJaa	Hi Ashley and congratulations!    Before you take anyone's advice on here, you need to call your priest and speak with him!!  What is or is not allowed could vary by parish.  But, here is what I know from doing a little research and being Catholic myself.  Usually a blessing of the marriage (called a validation ceremony) is NOT viewed as a wedding.  It is a small ceremony with usually some family present.    I cannot say this strongly enough....but you need to call your local church/priest.  The reason I say this is because a while back (on this forum)...perhaps about 6 months ago, a girl was in a real pickle about her "blessing" ceremony.  The reason was because she did not specifically ask her priest what was appropriate and not appropriate.  She had numerous bridesmaids/groomsmen, aisle runner, flowers, etc. etc. all in place, and THEN she questioned the priest about a month before and he said "absolutely none of that is permitted."  So....she was left in a real pickle as to what to do.      So...it's best to go right to the source and call your priest.  Good luck and congratulations!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	A blessing is usually a small event, family members and close friends. It's not 'another wedding'.   As the other answerer said, your guide is your parish priest. Contact him asap.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Yes, of course.  There will be a mass within the ceremony though.      Congratulations!    P.S.- In your counseling, I wouldn't mention that you wanted to get married for insurance benefits.  ;)|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Youll have to speak with the priest about what is allowable and what is not. Certainly if you haven't been living together or sexually active and just have the civil marriage certificate for insurance, then there will be no problem having a regular wedding with bridesmaids and flowers and all that. If, though, you're living together and having sex, then you're actually in a state of mortal sin, and the priest may prefer to get you through counseling quickly and have your marriage blessed as soon as possible so that you can remove the danger that would be weighing upon your soul. Depending on his sense of urgency, you might not have time to do all the usual "wedding" stuff.
88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	I would neither attend nor send a gift; I would simply decline the invitation.  It's incredibly rude to invite someone to the shower but not the wedding.  It's just a ploy to use people to get gifts.  I wouldn't play into it, or encourage the practice, by participating.    EDIT: It makes absolutely no difference if it's a big or a small wedding, or that the shower is hosted by someone other than the bride.  If you're having a small wedding, you have an even smaller shower.  It is greedy and disrespectful to invite people to a shower who are not invited to the wedding.  The people who are hosting the shower should know who is invited to the wedding, or should be able to check with either the bride or MoB/MoG if in doubt.  That's no excuse, it's laziness not to check the list.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	The people who decide the wedding guest list are usually not the same people who decide who to invite for the bridal shower.  The bride and groom usually decide who they want at their wedding, but it would be incredibly tacky for them to throw the bridal or wedding shower.  Whoever is hosting the shower, though, has a responsibility to check over the wedding guest list and to make sure they do not invite anybody to the shower who is not on the wedding guest list.  Some people aren't aware that they're committing a big faux-pas when they invite people to the shower who aren't going to be invited to the wedding.  I would either go to the shower and bring a small gift along, or not worry about getting any gift at all if you don't want to go to the shower.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Up to you, but it's incredibly rude to invite people to the shower and not the wedding.  I realize that the bride and groom don't always have control over the shower guest list though.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I wouldn't attend and I wouldn't send a card or gift. Being invited to the shower but not to the wedding is a breach of etiquette.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	it's up to you.  If you know the couple and want to gift them then do so.  If you don't want to gift them then don't.    If it were me and I knew the couple well,  I wouldn't go and I'd send them a token gift.    If I didn't know the couple well or at all then I'd ignore the invitation.    and yes, it is very rude to invite you to the shower and not the wedding.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	My first instinct is to say, I would not attend or get them a shower gift.  It's in incredibly poor taste to invite you to a shower where a gift is expected and not invite you to share in their special day.      Then I thought about it again... are they having a small wedding?  Is it an out of town wedding?  Are they really really poor and they just want to celebrate with you any way they can?  If that's the case - I'd buy something very small for the wedding shower (like $20 max) and be gracious.  BUT ONLY - if they have a darned good reason for not inviting you to the wedding!|`|XCQYuJHaaa	So they want a gift from you, and you are not invited to the wedding, if it was me they would get nothing.|`|mTKD9GQvaa	its really sude to invite someone to a shower and not the wedding. i would do neither!|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You should attend and give a shower gift if you are close to the bride. You may not be a wedding guest because they may have had to keep it to family only or a certain number because of budgetary issues. It's not uncommon for people to do this. My sister-in-law had a very big shower with a lot of friends who were all delighted to attend but her wedding was family only because they had to do it on a tiny budget. I didn't have a shower personally. It is entirely your choice. If you attend the shower you should bring a gift but if you don't a nice card will do.|`|3secB3Smaa	maybe the people who made the shower guest list did not realize you are not invited to the wedding.  Do you know of any others who are not invited and received a shower invitation too ?|`|DKJ8sjxVaa	It's SERIOUSLY rude to invite someone to a shower but not the wedding, but I'm wondering about the back story here?    Is the couple having a huge blow-out wedding, with tons of guests and such? Or do they perhaps not have the money for a huge wedding with tons of invites to everyone they know?     If it's a huge wedding, I say forget them- don't go and DON'T send a gift! If it's a small wedding, if they can't afford to invite everyone, then it's a 50/50. If it's your cousin, "close" friend or something similar, again I'd say no show, no gift.     Regardless of who/ what the situation is, I wouldn't send a gift and not go, though. No use spending your hard-earned money if you can't even enjoy the shower, you know?|`|AA11401067	Um - the couple who are marrying don't get to throw a shower. They can only suggest who they might like their hostess to invite into her home, and pencil in extra dates on their calendar.     Isn't it possible for you to call your hostess and talk about this?   If you are not related to the future bride or groom, you could suggest to your hostess that it would be much better to have a separate shower for wedding guests - and another for co-workers and friends Who Won't be able to make it to the wedding.      After all, how can a shower guest reply to a guest who might say; "I'll see you at the wedding"?     Are you all supposed to respond with"I can't be there, but I hope it goes well"?      You could, I guess, break with your friend because he or she put you on his or her wish list of the few people that he or she would like to meet with and introduce you to.     If you care to accept that, a small shower gift is perfectly fine. If you won't attend the shower and will never meet again, I think you simply do nothing. But you might miss out on meeting new and friendly people who enjoy your friend's company and wish your friend well in their married life.|`|mjyRcxUHaa	If you want to go you should go. If you go bring a gift.  As far as the wedding I wouldn't even think about it, you could make yourself crazy with all of the "talk". Eventually the reasons "Why" will present them selves and you'll feel really bad if they wanted you at the shower and you didn't go because of your jumping to conclusions.  Go have fun!! Don't worry be happy!|`|WxQFe0GYaa	That's weird, to be invited to the shower and not the wedding.  I would not go and not give a gift.|`|NGT9HQmnaa	I would not send a gift or go with a gift. That is horrible etiquette of them. That is like saying we want a gift or money from you but you are not good enough for us to invite you. Dont waste your time that is a slap in the face if you ask me.|`|73G030jiaa	etiquette says only those invited to the wedding should be invited to the shower. In my opinion the only exception I can think of that would be acceptable  at all is if the parents go out of state to attend/witness a small ceremony for military personnel before  a deployment.

Forget the recording.  that's cheesy.|`|0Mq6PHPuaa	If he likes sports : Get him a shirt or hat or something of his favorite team.    If he likes video games : Get him a gift card to GameStop.    If he likes to watch movies,play video games,etc. : Get him a gift card to Blockbuster.    If he likes to shop/fashion : Get him your local Mall's gift card. Like, my mall has a gift card that you can use at any store in the mall.    Just some random ideas.(:|`|FvB0hOIIaa	make sure whatever it is , that its creative and personal to both of you... that'll make it stand out from everyone else's gifts.  instead of an actual gift why not   bring him somewhere special.    for my bf's birthday i didnt give him any clues & brought him to the beach, i had my laptop with me with our fav movie and takeout from a chinese food place...  i also had blankets and pillows so we ate chinese on the beach while watching a movie ... it was a lot of fun !!!|`|hLPTGGFLaa	I think you singing Love Story would be a perfect gift.  The guys I dated prefer gifts that were homemade.  I hope your BF likes whatever you get him.    Hope I helped.  :)|`|nWi47DIoaa	I think you should write a romantic song to him, if you cant write songs    sing a song to him that you really think is something that he would     enjoy!!!

Not all women have a hysterectomy.  some never do.    my grandmother and mother both had hysterectomies when they were 25.      My mother died of breast cancer at age 42 she had an active sex life up until she died.    my grandmother is still alive and at age 85 (granddad is 90) also still has an active sex life (please don't ask how I know.  Let's just say I ALWAYS knock now before entering.)|`|dSpLfZFnaa	True, if they have a historectomy some of the sensation is lost but, it has nothing to do with frequency or desire and new experiences can overcome the loss.|`|SK7MxFTnaa	Funny...my 41 year old girlfriend is a BANSHEE in the bedroom.    I'm NOT going to complain one little bit.|`|AA11621340	OK - First, you are laboring under a very false impression! Where did you ever get the idea that just because a woman is over 50 she's had a hysterectomy? You also need to know that most women enjoy sex much more as they get older because they do not have to worry about getting pregnant  or being interrupted by a crying child in the next room - something that most men will never truly understand. Also, by the age of 50, most women are involved with men who are much less selfish lovers and who are also experienced enough to really please a woman, not just himself.How old are you anyway?You probably need to stick with playing with people your own age for a while.|`|AA12272885	Women peak sexually in their forties, and it is true that as estrogen levels drop (either naturally or because the ovaries are removed) it may become more difficult to become aroused, libido may be lower, and orgasms are not as intense, that is just biology.  It is possible however for women to continue to enjoy sex if they have a loving an caring partner who is understanding, and of course they have to want to please their partner.  There are also perscription medications a doctor can prescribe that will help.|`|AA12382198	My grandmother is 78 and she and her male friend still have a sexual relationship.

But with a very loving and understanding partner, she will feel loved and needed.  Eventually, she would do things that will make her partner happy in order to please him.
dnEmFs2maa	You should've just excused yourself from the table and went to the bathroom to clean up and change.  You should now apologize to your mother and to her friends for acting rudely.|`|yaULVEw2aa	How old are you, I'm not making a joke, I'm asking because the younger you are the less it would matter.  I don't understand why you pooped in your pants...do you have a sickness of some kind?

MjUentmjaa	you answered my question (about if he likes me more than a friend)  and i just want to let you know that you have to be confident in yourself, and that life is too short to be watching people take your guy.    but about your friend, if she was a real friend then she would'veve known that you like him and that she should have kept her hands off him.  some guy friends are meant to be just guy friends, and if he really would have liked you then he wouldnt be going to the dance with him.  i know you might not want to let go of your crush for this guy, but i can tell that your probably in middle school and you'll have alot of more guys to crush on.    so my advice is to move on from this guy and let your friend have him but you can still be friends with him, just nothing will probably come out from this|`|M0EehbBEaa	TELL HIM.  And talk to your best friend. I think she's jealous and shes not acting right|`|WTS4RHlgaa	he doesnt like you so it doesnt matter right?

ZaQ6iQWMaa	I'm wondering why he didn't file for unemployment, but that depends on how he lost his job. No judgment here - I've been laid off and fired before for stupid reasons, especially since I live in an "at will" state.    That's a hell of a lot of money going towards bills. What on earth is costing that much? $4000 is a lot for bills! I think you guys need to downsize - get a smaller, more fuel-efficient car (or cars); cut back on electricity; and consume less.     As for him, it IS tough out there. I'm working retail until I can get office work again, and haven't found it after nearly 6 months of searching. I wonder if he's not depressed for not getting anything back on his resume, but you guys fighting about this is going to for sure break up your marriage if one of you doesn't quit fighting about it. He needs to be bolstered, not put down. Be patient, but if you can't take it any more then maybe you guys should separate.   But you've got to get those bills under control. There isn't any reason for $4000 in bills - unless you make way over 6 figures a year!|`|NeTNnvSZaa	If he comes back  he's clearly a masochist.  I can understand your frustration but you can't brow beat him like that and expect him to maintain any self of pride.  I think  you just run him into the ground.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Sounds like you've already checked out hun. I would go straight for the divorce. He should be more supportive and he should be helping out with the income.If your friends are truly friends than you will keep them but staying in a loveless and unhappy marriage because of friends is really pointless right??GL You can do it on your own.You already have 1 kid and you don't need another.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Divorce.  I lost my 21-yr job last month, but I don't sit on my azz all day playing games.  (only half the day,lol) I send resumes, I signed up for schooling, I look for "dislocated worker' grants...     I guess he is a loser pothead, enabled his whole life.     LEAVE...he will not get better, only worse.  Take charge of thr future, there is a lot of help for you if you look for it!|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Yes but he doesnt understand that your "bad days" are because of all the problems he is giving you does he? Yes the economy is bad but like you said he CAN find a job even if it is flipping burgers or something to get you by you know. I would say let him leave and let him find his own way already. he will probably come back because who else is going to support him or do anything for him like you were. you deserve better.|`|B12E4rYiaa	You can do a trial separation during that time you can go to marital counseling to get guidance or if you decide you don't want to save the marriage then go ahead and get the divorce.|`|AA10461616	You answered your own question.  You said you don't really love him so why stay in the misery?  You wouldn't seriously stay marred just because you would miss your mutual friends?  I'd hope not.  That sounds more like you making excuses as you for some reason don't want to divorce him. Plus, if they are true friends, they won't take sides and they will still be friends with you both.  If he has no income, where is he going?  You say you are going broke, so you had better get you and your son to cheaper housing, etc. before that happens, unless him out of the picture cuts costs enough for you to stay where you are.   The economy certainly is a mess, but in these tough times, if both can physically work, they need to be, or be pounding the pavement every day for a job- ANY job until things improve.  These days, no matter how great ones original job was, no employer frowns on anyone taking a step down just to make ends meet, in fact they respect it.  He has to swallow his pride a bit for the greater good- your family survival financially.    I had to come back and add that those that say YOU are beating him down must not have read that he is not even looking for a job, just sitting around playing games.  Or those that say your "nagging" is making it worse, OMG, he is supposed to be a MAN.  You shouldn't have to nag at any rate, HE is supposed to be a man and work to support his family.  I am sure if he was trying to find a job that bothyou and I would agree with the "for richer or poorer" but that is when it is beyond someones control, like not being able to find a job despite real effort, not when his solution is denial and being lazy and playing video games.  That is such guy crap!  What is you acted like him and just went out doing a stereotypical lady pastime, like shopping?  I am sure there'd be no support here for you!  Yes, one should offer emotional support to their husbands, but babying them is another thing all together.  Men are supposed to act like men, not children.|`|o1yy6KABaa	No dont, him walking out shows he doesnt care enough, a partnership is supposed to be equal and he will soon realise how much you supported him when he gets his bills, dont be fooled though if he hasnt gotten a job, if you really do want to take him back then make it a condition that he is to hold a job for at least three months before you will move back to him.|`|encb0jc2aa	so my question is how the hell are you paying 4k in bills on his lazy welfare loving, mr. mario bros having, no tax paying, humpback *** unemployed  check|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Let him keep walking.

Consider what your son learns from all of this.|`|ByUS0k8waa	If you don't love him then why stay?! I am a strong believer in you took the vowels so now you have to make it work but sometimes I understand you fall out of love with someone. If you ever loved him you can find that again. However, I don't blame you about not letting him come back til he has a job. Maybe he will get the hint. Sorry your having to go though this but sometimes you just need some time to cool off. I think you should think long and hard before filing any papers with the courts.|`|elhcuN19aa	for richer or poorer  hmmmmmmm  remember that  and sometimes the wife has to step up herself and do it.....  Why not try getting him a job at your place of employment  the economy is bad right now  Where I live there are no jobs  A job I am trying to go for is out in Cali but I get to work from home if I get it  You cant beat his pride by nagging at him constantly.... That would drive a man to do the opposite accutally  you could get applications for him and have him fill them out and good luck.....  But you have to ask yourself  What if he does not get hired even if he applies  did he file unemployment?  you guys may qualify for aid....|`|WlnnsGM5aa	Divorce. It sounds like you have already given him plenty of chances. You don't need someone else to support when he isn't willing to givehis fair share.|`|hExkwyVLaa	move on... get rit off the low life and find urself a better person.. for over a year he hasnt care about ur marriage cuz if he did he be on his toes looking for a job.. u deserve better|`|eO82RK1Maa	you said you dont love him. so what is the real question.  let him go.  see where time takes each of you.|`|dLPONQQVaa	Its  atough economy but not trying and sitting on his fat *** playing computer games is not necessarily the best solution. Get divorced from this man, he seems rather useless and a parasite, taking advantage by your earnings.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	Sounds familiar. My Ex left me because of a debt burden(business went down) I was paying on and could not contribute to the household. I had a good job at the time and alternative income from a second source($150k). So I know your side was what my Ex's was like. I resolved the debt at the final of our divorce. I would sit down with him and try to explore job opportunities together that might be a temporary fit until the economy picks up. He should be open to this. If he has not even looked or tried finding a job that is a different story. He should look at the last three jobs he has had and list the top five things he has done on those jobs well. These are alternative areas that he maybe skilled in enough to acquire a job In this market. If he has to get two jobs until things turn around all the better. I was an Engineer, and also skilled in finance and building/development, as well as credit repair. When things got slow I got the buyout and was shown the door. If it were not for my other skill set I would have been in a bad spot. Funny thing is I went right to work in commercial finance and made a fortune. So the world does not end because you lost your job in one skill set area. Chances are he has other capabilities and he needs to explore them and not be engrossed in video games. Try to work it out but if he is set in his ways your marriage maybe in trouble.
AA10339249	I found an agency that made out the divorce papers for me. Just have someone make them out where you guys agree on whatever is written, then have him sign them. Check at your local courthouse to make sure this is okay. It worked for me.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	He'll get half, depending on the state.  You have to contact an attorney or paralegal in your state.|`|dItZAwI2aa	no hunter, this isn't a fairly easy process...per ur previous question u have a child...its not from this relationship but did he sign anything when u 2 got married concerning the child?    also, despite the fact that he came into the marriage with nothing and everything is in ur name, there's something called community property, meaning anything u have is his, anything he has is yours...so if an amicable divorce was possible then a 50/50 split would be in order...and i can already tell by the look on ur face that this doesn't make u very happy right now.    now, and again referring 2 ur previous question the fact that u have supported him will also come into play, probably decreasing the 50/50 part as long as u can prove u put more into the relationship financial wise than he did.    my suggestion is this: almost all atty's offer free initial consultation, take advantage of that and make an appointment with one, take all necessary paperwork with u and ask all questions and concerns u have  for free...that will help u 2 decide ur best way to proceed.    if i can be of any more help please don't hesitate 2 ask.    good luck and GOD bless.|`|encb0jc2aa	nope you screwed 50-50 down da line|`|NWH3MnE9aa	CONSULT AN ATTORNEY.|`|GsrLh50laa	It's cheap to do If you prepare the paperwork yourself instead of hiring a lawyer to do it for you.

If you've bought anything during the marriage, he gets half.. If you  have joint checking accounts at time of divorce, he gets half. Anything that 's of the marriage is  50/50 if you live in one of those states. You need to see an attorney or if you two can come to a mutual agreement on everything, you can get info off web and the paperwork. Other than items gained during marriage, it really isn't hard to get one unless he contests it.|`|79eBn6V8aa	contact a lawyer and expect to pay about 1000 if you don't own a home or anything...as long as no one puts up a fight, that should cover it.|`|eO82RK1Maa	it should be very easy but he could demand half of all belongings whether in your name or his.  the legal process would be very easy and not so expensive.

AA10065812	You will need an attorney in Oklahoma.  Email me and I can give you someone to ask about a referral.  He lives in Tulsa, but has been in the fathers rights movement for 30 years.  If she calls you, tape record the conversation, but not if you call her.  In your state it's illegal, but the laws apply based on the origin of the call.  http://www.rcfp.org/taping/states/oklaho...  http://www.rcfp.org/taping/states/massac...    You may need to consider getting a job there and relocating.  As for what Connecticut they did have jurisdiction for six months after the move.  You may have an action against the judge.    Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.    Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      Gather evidence.  Now, you can't just record your conversations, you also have to transcribe them into the daily journal.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...  http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice  http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/|`|IikTFnCxaa	Well unfortunately, it looks as if you are going to have to get a lawyer in Oklahoma.

Z7TloxtOaa	Wow. I am happy that there are people like you still  out there. May God Bless you even more.     I THINK;   that to start off it would be a good idea to talk to her. Tell her that it isn't fair, and that she is equally important as every other person.   I also think that you should get to know her more, ask her what are the problems and what she/they like and what they don't. If I wasn't being equally treated I would definately want to know it, and have justice done. Also, find out how she lives, does she have the basics, that she needs of everyday life or is her husband taking it away. Things like that.

5LT6LRUZaa	the court will consider the fact that they have had this relationship since her birth, it will most likely  not matter that he is not the bio dad, why he was allowed to sign a paternity affidavit is beyond me, this document is suppose to state that he believes that he is the bio dad,  not the "adopted" dad, but that point most likely will be moot to the court, for 15 years he was her father, no involvement from the bio dad ever, she views him as her father, the court will most likely view him as if he is the bio dad.|`|lgyPxg26aa	He is not your daughter's biological father.  Unless the judge rules that his acknowledgment of paternity is binding after a divorce from her biological mother, he will not owe child support for your daughter.    The laws might be different, but since you are divorcing and the 15yo is not his, my opinion is that he is not responsible for support.      I suppose you could go after her biological father for the support he should have been paying all these years.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	It really depends.  He did sign the acknowledgement but he's not the bio dad.  Doesn't matter if the kid's ever seen her real dad.  That doesn't matter.|`|IXskJPlVaa	You can not be sure about the out come of legal proceedings until it is over. Morally he should support - make up your mind how you'll like it and discuss with your attorneys handling the settlement. If you get it ok else forget about it, you'll find alternative ways on your own - everything works out, you can only do your best and that you are doing. Best of luck.
AA10604300	your question is ill defined.    You are however being given the subtle hint to move on,  this is done, so as to not hurt you.      You would do best to turn to the Lord Jesus for salvation,   as salvation, is what will soothe you in this time of your earthly life.    You will find in Jesus, an honest and eternal bond of lovingkindness, that the Lord will never take away from you.    Jesus will never reject you if you call on him and ask him to forgive you and accept you into heaven.    Jesus died for your sins and rose again the third day, so all you now have to do to get eternal life is   beleive that Jesus is your Lord and ask him to forgive you your sins,      see no religious binds here in this message, you either accept or   reject Jesus,      heaven or no heaven. God gives you the right to choose,

If you're going through puberty, then maybe it's ok.  If you're a mature adult and you want to "sex up" a pillow, please see a mental therapist.  But, I really think you should develop a healthy relationship with any person or in your case, pillow that you sleep with.  Make sure you and the pillow are on the same page in the course of your relationship.  When the time is right, ask the pillow its beliefs about love and sex.  Respect the pillow's wishes.  If the pillow wants to have sex, by all means do it!!  If not, kiss the pillow "goodnight" and leave it alone.  By the way, CONGRATULATIONS FOR HAVING THE MOST DUMB *** QUESTION ON YAHOO ANSWERS!!

Friends are gonna end up not doin as much with you when your dating her good friend or your good friend. I suggest when you 3 hang out you pay attention to the friend just as much as the girl u like but not flirty tho. Just so she feels not so left out. Then when you and the girl you like hang out by yourselves thats when you give her all the attention. Just spread it out when your with friends and her. She'll understand. If not them i wouldnt stick around that girl cuz it prob means shes controlling. ouch. i hope this helps
UvHiXIlAaa	It will only get worse. Cut the cord now. He's not worth it. There are a thousand other guys who would love to take his place and treat you with respect. Your time, your affection, your attention, your LIFE should not be wasted on someone who doesn't appreciate you.Bottom line: If he won't talk to you about it and resolve the problem, its time you dropped him. It sounds like you're kind of desperate not to be lonely but this problem won't clear up all by itself and will probably get worse and lead to other problems. It sounds like he and his friends are kind of immature and can't really accommodate women as participants in their conversations and that might take years to turn around. Life may be too short to wait for that to happen|`|1uRUaSblaa	Maybe something happened to him or his hp?  Maybe he just need his personal space at the moment?

I mean sure revenge can be sweet but it can also be so wrong at times. I don't know what he did to you but since you say its bad I am no one to judge. I don't think that by hooking up with one of his friends is really revenge. I mean if it didn't bother him the first time it shouldn't now. In my opinion you shouldn't be fooling around with guys who are older than you. Sure their more mature than the normal 13 year old boy from your school but they have other intentions in their mind. The reason I say that your cousin might not be bothered is that he told you to sit on his friends lap so I don't think anything else can bother him. I mean I have cousins who are super protective even from their friends but they have never put me in that situation. I think you should just be safe and don't try to do something that you might regret later and not because you will hurt him but yourself.|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	revenge is always sweet, but dont take it too far!|`|QXfEK4jcaa	very stupid to get any kind of revenge!|`|p0D4dxEqaa	Revenge is negative thinking and will do you more harm than your cousin.    Forgive and forget........you will end up far happier.|`|8DDK2K5baa	make him jealous? no no no. thats horribly wimpy.    what you need to do, is in the dead of night, disable their vehicles, by cutting the gas line. once they get out of the car to check whats wrong, activate the tripwire, which will then activate the timer. when they go inside, to use the phone, wait for the timer, and allow the coposition B charges you placed under their foundation, to blow the house sky high, then drag te body, cut it into little peices, and burn it.    the end|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	Don't hook up with someone for revenge. You're only 13. Don't give yourself away like that. And revenge is never the best medicine. Talk to your cousin about it and try to work things out. Revenge always backfires! And don't try to hook up or flirt with his friends either. I wouldn't be surprised if it got back to him in a bad way. Boys at that age just want to get in there, and get out of there. They don't have feelings for you, rather they are just very...h'd. It's not good to hook up with multiple people, especially at that age. You're way too young! You have your whole life to do that, and people will view you in a negative way. His friends probably already talked about it amongst themselves. You're digging yourself a bigger whole. And if you are going to revenge, pick something else that doesn't involve you.|`|y999LLxdaa	His friends might make fun of him for a day or two for having an EASY causing, and hui might get embarrassed or mad...but YOU are the one who'll end up with a label of being easy so you'd do more damage to your self then to him, why disrespect yourself and your body???/ think of another way to get your revenge..please....
MfyNUtiUaa	tiff your friend should go to court and settle the problem many times the judge gives them the right to their belongings.  even though his wife does not want to give him the stuff he could even have her reimburse money for things he is missing|`|1hciyvKdaa	I think, hes lying to you and hes not trying to leave, hes stringing you along, and your young and your posting here about it, so thats why I beleive this.|`|nAwLPHHNaa	There ARE lawyers for this sort of thing..and legal aid for those who cant afford an attorney. by law, there's not much she CAN do, all things are divided up between the two parties.  personal items and things that were acquired b4 marriage, gifts etc .. are not to be withheld. call someone now!|`|ZYS2E0dtaa	He should pretend to change his mind and decide to "work it out".  He should say he wants his stuff out of storage to put in their house, to make him feel more at home and happier...  Whatever he has to say, then once he has his stuff out of storage, he should pack up and leave while she is at work and don't look back.
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Spaghetti or lasagna, garlic bread and Caesar salad. It's filling, most people like it and doesn't cost hardly anything to make. But while you may have to pay a bit more, it will be much easier on your family if you get pans of lasagna from the frozen section of Costco that you just heat and serve. Otherwise, your family is going to be slaving over a hot stove and unable to enjoy the ceremony or reception at all.|`|VLO7e4tMaa	If you have a morning wedding, you could make brunch.  Eggs are very inexpensive, so you could make breakfast tacos, or baked egg casseroles, which you put together the night before and can feed a lot.  Add a  big fruit platter or fruit salads, cinnamon rolls (pick up from a bakery). If you want alcoholic drinks, mimosas or bloody Marys, otherwise just the usual juices & coffee.  Try to think of things that you don't' have to prepare that day of the wedding, because you need to enjoy your big day.  Good luck, and congratulations!|`|agTCqkLDaa	Brunch weddings can be cheap because you can serve a lot of food for low cost.  Plus, the only alcoholic beverage you need is champagne and that's optional.      My mom is pretty good at this stuff and in some cases it can save people a couple grand; at least a few hundred.|`|hMavMBo4aa	Spaghetti/Lasagna.  When you're cooking for that many, bulk is cheaper.  Go to Sam's Club or Costco.  So, a pasta dish, chicken, chips/dip..|`|Z74ZQFRjaa	We're using inexpensive menu items for our reception but we're not doing it ourselves, although a few items we might.  We have a Costco nearby so inexpensive bulk food easily.  Thats where we're getting the sparking cider most likely (no alcohol at ours).  We can also get premade trays with veggies, meats, cheeses, and all that  '  But I am considering making a few items if possible.  One is a veggie type salad which is simply cucumber slices, mushrooms (you cut store bought fresh ones into quarters), possibly a few other items and then you put say a balsamic dressing or italian dressing over it and let it sit for 24hrs or so, pickles it just right    Crock pots or slow cookers for meat or anything, meatballs and such  If there are food items that are favorites at family gatherings those are always nice too|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Well I'm doing cornish hens which are cheap and can feed a lot of people, fried catfish, baked spaghetti, baked mac & cheese, turkey burgers, squash fries, cabbage, marinated beef tips. Most of those can be bought in bulk. You can have a chicken drummettes and maybe BBQ theme meal. We could have mini cheesy grits and shrimp to tie into our southern cooking menu. You can have a taps bar with mini pappetizers, i.e. stuffed mushrooms, mni beef wellingtons, mushrooms on crustini, mini sourdough pizzas, etc.     We are having a southern style lunch with in family style so our dollar can stretch and I'm only pyaing 2.00 per person. So it's not bad. We are also having a pound cake and homemade ice cream as part of the dessert bar.|`|ghLdIUz0aa	cabbage rolls, spaghetti. (rigatoni), salads, do a sandwich spread, like ham cheese turkey, with some buns. mixed vegies,|`|onxX6N9maa	So I did my wedding all for only 3,000.00 and my advice to you would be pasta, like penne vodka, it goes a long way which is great and filling, try and do a salad as well with nuts in it, greens are cheap and the nuts have protein and are filling, another idea is potato's. try and think of filling foods that are cheap and easy to make well. Lasagna is another good one too. Buffet is always best especially if you dont wanna hire help. You can get dinner ware that looks real but is plastic, I've found it at bj's. Amazing stuff. Good luck! And congrats!

vOUDHws3aa	In my past experiences, guys do not joke around about marriage. If he is willing to hint around or even make comments about being married to you, odds are that it is seriously on his mind. Especially since you said you've brought it up before and he's never really commented and this time he brought it up on his own.  I wouldn't bring it up to him but would wait for him to make another comment and then ask him if was trying to drop a hint or something along that line.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	yes he was feeling you out|`|AA11538662	Maybe it was his way of seeing how you'd react to the possibility. Ya know, it is 2009, women can ask a man to marry.    Mary in Camden, MI|`|IItMQ4jzaa	Don't read too much into it!    If he's is already getting his milk for free, I don't think he will want to buy the cow anytime soon!|`|AA10858602	You should've jumped on it right when he said it, and asked him what he meant by that.  Try bringing up the subject of marriage again and see what he says.

JzYlcuXzaa	I would say that it's okay to be selfish at a time like this.  If you are not happy with the guy that you're with, leave!  It's not fair to him and it's definitely not fair for you.  The things you guys bought together are just material things, they're not reason enough to stay.  As for the kids, that will probably be the hardest part but if not all of you is in this, know that one day everything you're holding inside will explode and be worst on you, the kids and him.    If your heart belongs to someone else and that person is willing to be committed with you as well, go for it.    You only live one life, you don't want to get to the end knowing that you lived for someone your heart did not choose.|`|yC7hgBfGaa	i like mayonnaise|`|UrUpWmA7aa	You need to really stop. Chil out... and think about what you really want. Just make sure that if you choose to back out of your current situation, that you do it in a respecful fassion.    Be very sure of what you want when you make your decision    Until then. Stop, meditate or something... and keep your mind off of this issue for a while until the answer becomes obvious.|`|60ApQsGOaa	Ive posted questions on here and had people reach out to me, and I wish I could do the same for you. The best advice I have is to get both (yes I said both) of them together and have a long, LONG conversation with both of them. not a bitchfest, but just adult to adult expressing your feelings. At least that way both parties will know your perspective?? :(|`|pOLBKKNpaa	well, I read your whole paragraph    you can't plan the whole rest of your life all at once, but maybe your next move should be:  (this is a suggestion from someone who does not know you at all, just read one paragraph)  be honest with the person you are with and tell him that you cannot live there and you will be moving because you have realized that he is not your future    figure out where you can go, and then start tinking from there about your next decisions|`|RVicFEyFaa	Your in love with the other guy. You need to move out. If you can't reason with telling the man your living with about the other, it is always wise to move & say, I need time. Don't let him know your w/someone else already, that would add insult to injury. Leave & soon so more feelings aren't damaged|`|aBWT7SbMaa	not gonan read that but u need to chill out, writing sumthing that long means u have alotta time, less time on the computer more time out in te world,|`|dxo8DT55aa	Your a disgrace, those poor kids are going to be devastated you should have never entered the relationship.|`|maJpBDuvaa	Ignore the spammers and people who "have a life" that can't read that piece of text.    Well, it would depend on whether that other significant other loves you back (it sounds like it). So:    A) Other guy loves you back same way you do for him. It will be hard for the father's children to accept, but maybe you could go with the other guy and still visit the children? If he really did love you, can't he wait for you? At least till you help the person your in debt too become steady on his own?  -OR-  B) The guy you love now doesn't like you back. Would you risk losing both the children and the guy? [which sounds like this is not the case]|`|O5DKaUgaaa	You must be honest with him. No matter how much he loves you or how much he does for you, you will hurt him worse if you marry him and he finds out that you only did it out of pity. If you are not completely in love with this man, and you are in love with someone else, marrying him will only hurt your both. Plus, being that he has kids, if they start looking at you as their mother and then you leave them and their father, you could end up hurting them in the long run as well. You must tell him the truth, and do it sooner or later. The longer you wait the more invested he will become and the harder it will become. Not only that, he may end up despising you if you let him get to invested in this relationship and then he finds out that you knew you were not in love with him from the beginning. After all he has done for you, you at least owe him the truth. You may end up losing him, but at least you gave him, and yourself, a real chance at finding true love and happiness.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	Anyone who uses guilt to control you is not acting in your best interest.  By cooperating, you are not acting in his best interest.  Do you really think his kids will be better off with you miserable, depressed, unloved, unappreciated and in the end, blaming them for what was caused by your weakness?  It doesn't matter what or who you have waiting for you.  You are actually keeping Mr. I-don't-want-to-lose-you from finding someone who CAN be all that family needs.  Why should he look for someone else when he has you?
af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	He is insecure. He can only see it from his own point of view, which apparently includes hooking up with his female friends.

About you having a friend for your science classes is fine and as long as your husband is fine with it, i dont think there will be problems related. You should not tell your friends you have a guy friend that you study with because they are jealous of you.|`|rp372bcYaa	It just depends on the people. I really think its based on how much each spouse trust each other.     I think as long as your husband is ok with, then there is absolutely no problem.   My husband and i have only one agreement that is somewhat about who we hang out. We both decided neither of us would go to a bar without the other.    Its whatever you and your spouse decide, dont let others opinions bother you or concern you.|`|AA11437439	i think that if your husband is fine with it then that is what matters at the end f the day    i still keep in touch with various chaps that i have known since university days and am very thankful for them     they are more like family now anyways with over the years when we had our son they became very doting honoary 'uncles' to our cherub    i do get rised eyebrows about it from outside the family but we are both fine with it and our son is happy too and that is what counts    problems can arise if the 'other' man can ot respect marriage or your relationship    things to watch out for    comparing himself to your husband  making negative comments about your husband to you  crude jokes/sex talk  flirting  pushing boundaries after you ahve clearly stated NO in something    but some guys are just thankful to have a friendship and find the fact that you are married helps take some of the uncertainty out of the situatin so they can relax|`|MfyNUtiUaa	society has a way to view things and make it a problem. in a way you are like me.  i have a great relationship with my husband we believe in each other and TRUST each other a lot.  my best friends are all male with the exception of my best friend Vanessa i have known my friends all my liFe and i would not trade them for the world.  what i am trying to say is that no matter what people say if you and your husband have a great marriage it will not matter who you have as a friend remember people ALWAYS talk about you sometimes because they don't like you or your husband or sometimes because you have the life and relationship they always dream of.

AuclJaXHaa	This is an extremely difficult question. I am so sorry that you had to suffer through all of that. I know this may not sound like much help but this one is up to you. You are the one who endured all of this heartache and physical pain. You need to look inside yourself and see if you are ready to forgive. You need to be 100% sure. If you feel that you are ready to see him after all of the things he has done, than I believe that you should. Remember if at all you feel uncomfortable, you CAN leave. Best of luck. You are a very strong person, you will make the right decision for you.|`|o6K4Dr5Daa	No matter what happens his still your father... I know that the past between you and your father didn't work out to the point he does all those painful stuff to you but past is past... you should move on.... He already suffered and paid his mistakes by spending almost his entire life in bars.... You write that he's already 87... I think you should find in your heart to forgive him... you cannot erase the fact that his your father... You should show him that you already forgive him just like God forgive the humans for all their sins... we should forget that past coz the damage is already done... the best way is to move on, forget the past and forgive.... you shoudn't let that past get in the way.... you should make things better for the future.... it will give you relieve if you  forgive coz it means your leaving behind the painful scarce and welcoming the present.... Every scarce or every pain will heal in time and happiness will come.....    the decision really depends on what you choose.... whether to forgive or keep the painful past...... but in my opinion it is best to move on....
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Not it is not anti-semitic. You are the one getting married, not your mom, so you decide what you carry and what you don't. You said that your mom isn't even a practicing Jew so why would it even matter to her? I agree that if you are not Jewish, it makes no sense to carry something that goes against your beliefs.|`|uE8FyJijaa	It's absolutely not anti-semitic.  Anti-semites have an irrational hatred towards Jews.  You're just not embracing the culture.    call their bluff and refuse to carry it thus standing your ground.  Unless your family is anti-daughterite, they'll support you.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	It's not anti-Semitic, because you are not making disparaging or prejudiced claims against Jews.    However, it is a little bit hardheaded. It would mean so much to your mom if you carried this book that has been a tradition in her family. Don't think of it as doing something for Judaism - think of it as doing something that will mean the world to your mother and is part of a beautiful family tradition. None of your guests will be able to see what book you're carrying, and if anyone asks, you can just say, "It's a family tradition - it was given to my great-grandfather during World War I and it's been in our family ever since!" They will be totally impressed and think it's really cool.    My best friend just got married and she, like all her sisters and her mother and grandmother, wrapped her bouquet in a handkerchief that had belonged to her great-grandma. I wish my family had some kind of continuing tradition like that - I think you're really lucky, actually.|`|COmp4sIuaa	They're crazy. Have your wedding.|`|agTCqkLDaa	You can be Christian by heritage too.  Miraculously, this gets left out of our curriculum, hmm, wonder why.  WITH THAT being said, no, what you are doing is not anti-semitic, she is being dramatic.  What she is doing to you is actually anti-Christian (we also don't have a word for this, hmm, wonder why) because she is judging you and treating you maliciously SOLELY on your religious belief.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	My fiance was raised Jewish, but does not practice. But he still considers himself Jewish. We're talking about a group of people who have been discriminated against and killed for centuries. So even tho they may not practice the religion, there's still a sense of 'membership' due to the suffering of their ancestors.    So, no, it doesn't symbolize that you are Jewish. It symbolizes the acknowledgement of the suffering and murder of millions of jewish people... you can still be proud of your heritage without agreeing with the religious aspects of that heritage. In this sense, it would seem anti-semetic (I don't think you are, I'm just saying...) Also, it's tradition for the women in your family. If you're respecting the religious traditions of his family and even adopting them, wouldn't it be right to compromise and include your family's traditions?    The US is said to be founded on Judeo-Christian values. As much as some anti-religion types would like to believe otherwise, our basic rights granted by the Constitution are based on the 10 Commandments. I would consider myself agnostic, I was raised Catholic, but I still acknowledge this truth.    The truth is, the ties between Judaism and Christianity are strong. The Jews follow the Old Testament, just not the New. The only noticeable difference in that prayer book would be no mention of Jesus. The basic ideals will be the same, it's faith in the same God.    With all this information, I don't think there's any reason not to carry the book and make your mother happy. As much as this is one of the most important days of your life, it's also one of the most important days of hers.     Note: This is just my opinion... I hope you don't feel at all that I'm attacking you in any way. I've tried really hard to word it so you wouldn't think I was. My fiance's family has tried to force me to convert to Judaism against my will, and it won't happen. But my catholic family members wanted to include catholic traditions in my wedding. If there was going to be any traditions, it would be compromised... having a little bit of both traditions mixed in. But we decided to save all the trouble (and money) and we're just getting married at the courthouse!    Good luck!|`|4d3Md9pnaa	just so you know - you can be Jewish by heritage, actually.  although, like you, I think more modern times, people don't see it that way anymore.  (I'm studying a Jewish-Palestinian conflict in class.)    but, it's not anti-semitic.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	Firstly, it is not anti-Semitic.  That term conveys hatred or bigotry.      Secondly, having 'Jewish' as part of her heritage is obviously important to your mother even though she doesn't actively practise the religion.  I'm no authority on the topic but I think there is a cultural aspect to being Jewish, in addition to the religious aspect.      Would it really be so awful if you carried a symbol of your heritage on your wedding day?  Could you view it as a tie to the past rather than a religious symbol?|`|ghLdIUz0aa	it might be because its been a tradition for years, and it means alot to your mother. at least your mother is being okay with you converting to a different religion. i would do that for my mother, if thats what makes her happy.|`|VpCtXEMGaa	No it's not antisemitic. I think it maybe a cultural or tradition. But antisemitic no. Just tell your mom how you feel. And why would she withdraw funds from your wedding over something so petty?|`|E70A7aqcaa	It just sounds like you decided to not be Jewish, but to be Christian instead.  I guess, in one way, it can be seen as anti-semitic in that the Jewish faith and Christian faith are in direct opposition to each other in their beliefs over Jesus of Nazareth, but, in our modern times in this country, I can see where it wouldn't be seen as anti-semitic in that you're not attacking Jews or their faith as did Hitler,  or the modern day arabs.  I guess  you could respect  your mother's perspective wherein she's wanting you to honor some tradition for the women in the family at weddings.  And at the same time, by not doing what she wants, you're demanding that she honor your decision to become Christian, at some financial, and maybe emotional, cost to you.  But, wasn't it Jesus who said, "He that loveth father or mother more than me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of  me."  (Matthew 10:37)  I know I have failed Him many times in that direction.  I pray He forgives me and has a lot of mercy.  God Bless you.|`|TXddP0uxaa	I agree with what "My Thoughts" has said, and want to add some thoughts to that.  In addition to acknowledging the history and heritage of your family, it is a small way of telling your mother that while your faith is moving in another direction, you still respect the traditions of the past.  Additionally, remember that the Jewish faith doesn't believe anything CONTRARY to beliefs of Christians;  Christians just believe some ADDITIONAL things.  So, nothing in a Jewish prayer book would be against or offensive to your own beliefs.      To me, it seems like a very small gesture you can make for your mother in an attempt to include her in your wedding and future with your husband.  Why not make this tiny concession instead of having years of hard feelings?|`|OL2zBhddaa	First of all, if your mother is Jewish, you are Jewish (by definition a Jew is someone born to a Jewish mother).  To be Jewish is more than believing in that religion, it is a culture and a fate of people.   Even if you convert to Christianity, you will always be Jewish.  You do realize Jesus was a practicing Jew so I do not think that could offend any Christians by carrying a Jewish prayer book.|`|QenW1Ok7aa	Jesus was a Jew. If you truely consider yourself a "Christian" bride, you should honor your Jewish heritage, alongside your new beliefs.     Carry the damn book-you are Jewish, and Christian-just like Jesus of Nazareth.And it would make your mother happy.    Not carrying the book doesn't strike me as anti-semetic at all.    But stating, 'I think it symbolizes that the bride is Jewish, which I am not.'....                  I think that's what's truely upsetting your mother. It seems very strange to proclaim yourself as "not Jewish" just because you are not a religious Jew.I'm Italian. I don't speak Italian or live in Italy or eat pasta every day.Still Italian though. If the Italians had been persecuted for centuries, the way that Jews were, and suddenly I was saying, "I'm not Italian."-that would be Weird. It would creep the hell out of my father and grandfather.|`|KOa5ufCFaa	My personal opinion is that you should have a Christian ceremony if that's what you want.  Remember it's YOUR wedding...the day is meant to be about YOU and your soon-to-be husband.  Once you focus on that, no other drama seems to matter.  I'm sure it's difficult to be that determined about it, especially if you're close to your mother.  But I think you should do what's right for you and your future family.
b05bKonnaa	Damn straight! I know she's a baby killer and all, but I'd like to get a piece of that cake any day!

I'm gonna get him a sweater and some shoes, since I know thats what he likes and what I like 2 see him in, just get him something that you would think he wants or just ask him|`|40qTdKuPaa	Do a sexy dance for him in a outfit|`|FM614SKQaa	make him a great dinner, like steak.   buy a gift for both occasions, like a dvd or a video game  make a sexy coupon book|`|opZTyykPaa	sex of course jkjk... sumthing that will make him happy tho... :)
hBSh8Y1haa	I would probably answer your question if I could read or understand it...|`|a9DjyK7gaa	Your mother is an alcoholic.
sNZdXnZ8aa	i'm sorry KYLIE  i wish good luck for u and ur family    i know if i was that kid that knows Ken, i would NEVER tell him  i don't think anyone would, if you were crying then it is obvious you are sensitive, so i don't think anyone is a big enough *** hole to tell this ken guy    don't worry  p.s for such a background, you handle ur emotions really well :)|`|lQXJwUOkaa	In this situation since the police had to become involved previously  because of this guy...I believe that you kind of have to tell your mom  at least so she can have a heads up on the sitution...b/c as we all know  that the boy most likely told his uncle that he seen you especially due to your reaction because he may not know his uncle as violent, I know I would tell my realtive I seen someone that they were close to and then they freaked out, I say tell because you want your mom to be prepared if she has to take some action against this guy!!! I mean its not like you are going to get in trouble because you did nothing wrong!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Chances are nothing will come of this and your probably just stressing over nothing. And even though your scared to tell your parents, I think that's the best thing to do in this situation. Your parents can get a restraining order if necessary and  this guy violates it, he goes back to jail. So please tell your parents.|`|4boTYkt7aa	You have to go tell your mom at least.You don't want her to get hurt,not knowing he was around.She would not see it coming.Warn her and let her take whatever action that she needs to.Watch your back too.|`|F0XEKHyVaa	Tell your mom.  You don't need to deal with this by yourself, and it would be best your mom knew ahead of time if Brian might wind up coming around.|`|z08jBhoqaa	tell your mom asap!!!! she can help you and keep you safe ! :)|`|g0G54QSiaa	Omg wow!  Well your mom seems like a very nice person If I were you I would just tell her.  If you see him anywhere at all, I would call the popo. (police)  I'm sorry I know this answer didn't help much cuz I just said things that you didn't wanna do:(    Hmmm.. I would be very safe And cautious justincase. Don't go anywhere alone! Even if it's just walking to your friends house across the street.   I think you should relax a little and try trusting the boy.( the nephew?) If you told him everything about abusing your mom and the drugs and alcohol I hope that he would be a good enough kid to not make you suffer anymore! :) g'luck. If you want more answers just post another question I like answering them and helping:)
MX1shAbcaa	I'll get right to it and edit the details.  Best of luck ~  ????i? ?.
ScEG7QEjaa	Tell her parents, as well as your parents.   This is a very big situation, and they should be concerned along with you.  Once they know, you should recommend going to a therapist.   Help her get through it. Don't get her angry.  It dosen't matter what she says to you, if you tell, then you care about her. If you never told, then she might commit suicide. Of course, that dosen't make anything better by me saying that. Sorry.     -Tell her parents  -Tell her everything wrong she has done  -Tell your parents  -Help her get through these tough times|`|yV8fog7Paa	The best thing you can do to help her is tell her parents secretly what she has been doing to get her some help, your friend needs it and that is the best thign you can do for her.|`|DQeUKMbPaa	give her the number to a suicide hot-line that she can talk to a Professional. also let her know you are here for here. maybe let her do a little talking, maybe she just need someone to tell. and be her rock if her parents are a little crazy, take her to your house alot so your parents can show her what she needs. let her know you care about her. maybe share with her things that happened to you. and let her know that when she gets over it and becomes the Beautiful woman she will one day be...she will wish she never cut herself. and she'll have to cover them up, unless she isn't embarrassed. tell her, what if your going to the beach or swimming pool with your kids, and they ask "what happened mommy?" and you have to explain|`|d7XdHc9aaa	It doesn't matter what you're friend will think of you, you have to tell her parents, cause theyre the people in the best position to help her. My friend was kind of doing the same thing, but not as severe, we told herparents, she was mad at first, pulled the "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO THAT...", but we told her parents a month ago, and were all good friends still.
1uRUaSblaa	Virginity is a virtue and rare these days.  It is an honour to be a virgin till marriage.  Why exchange it for a mere fling?  Is that what you are worth?|`|IDQ9DOTiaa	I bet he's using you to get over his girlfriend. Give him some space, he just got out of a four month relationship. Dont have sex with him. It will screw up everything. Dont be dumb. No offense, just saying.
zDmGngXVaa	"I don't have any money babe, can you pay for my bill?"  "I'm broke babe and I need new shoes, can you spare me?"  "Hey babe I just got this unknown bill and I don't have the money for it, can you pay it?"  There are SO many ways to know when a guy is just with you for money!  I had that problem and I swear it nearly killed my credit but thankfully I got   knocked in the head with some common sense and left him real quick!|`|AA10858602	Your husband was deployed, so I assume you mean he was in the military.  You were his dependent he would not have gotten away with rarely sending you money if you contacted his higher ups about it.  They would've made him give you a portion of his check.  He would be a gold digger if he used your money to buy his things, obviously you aren't paying his bills otherwise his credit wouldn't be bad,  he sounds like he is just plain selfish, and maybe a shopaholic.  It sound like a good thing that you are getting out.|`|N28zLxtpaa	He sounds selfish or he has another family that he was sending money to.|`|81wvN8Rraa	He's working but never has money. He expects you to pay all the bills. He has nice things but never gives you anything nice.|`|AA10540570	you've probably seen all the signs baybay.  But signs would be long periods of unemployment-financially irresponsible-always has nice things but YOU always buying them! He tries to repay you with things other than money. He won't do things you like unless you buy him things/give him money...|`|YzObEmUqaa	If he pries you for spare change for his cigarettes  If he asks you to pay something for him  If he uses sex to get you to do thing for him  If he's always broke like you said...  Where's his money?  Probably uses it to pay for his side action  And you're being there as his bank...|`|QC7QgTZ9aa	u got played. pure and simple. i'm sorry gal. i hope you didn't waste all your sexy charms on that jerk!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|a9DjyK7gaa	You are dumber than a box of rocks.

AA10172433	Just be upfront with him. Tell him that you really value his friendship, and are interested only in being friends, but that you're open minded and would love a bit of fun on the side. Be clear that fun is just that, fun, and that you are not looking for a romantic relationship with him and do not want to be his girlfriend. If he is okay with it, then go forward. As long as all of the parties involved have an understanding about what is happening, you're not using him.    I think it is really nice that you care about his feelings and don't want to use him. That says a lot about you. :)
mkph8r0taa	You need to let your mother know what is going on, tell your father, and/or talk to the school counselor. Do NOT let this guy get away with what he did! Honestly, if he did it once, he will do it again! I know you are afraid to say something, but what if next time you are alone with him... he does something worse?? You cannot let him think he will get away with this. He will probably be nice and sweet to you for the next few weeks for fear of you telling on him, but know this, I can almost guarantee you that this will happen again and once he sees that you aren't going to rat on him, he will no longer be sweet to you, if anything it will turn into threats if you tell on him. He will think he has control over you. If you had a child, and your husband was doing this to them, wouldn't you want them to come forward to you nomatter what?? Please do not overlook this and think he will change overnight!!|`|COmp4sIuaa	Do not blame yourself. He's a coward if he's hitting his step-daughter.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	You should try to move in with your dad.|`|kpPOzMpeaa	you NEED to tell your mom. there's nothing right about this. in what you've said..his anger is slowly progressing, so very bad things will start happening soon if something like this happens again. he says that you can tell your mom if it happens again, but that will be his excuse every time. and don't feel bad for him! he slapped you! you were defending yourself because he's not treating you like a person. be safe! hope this helped!|`|ScHW4842aa	I hope you listen to what I have to say.   Your father sounds like he does love you a lot. Why dont you see him... because your mother doesnt want you to? Well - you are old enough to make your own decisions. YOU tell HER you will be seeing your father - and if she does not allow it, then as soon as you are 18, you will move out to live with him.     I cannot believe what your step father did to you. But he does sound very sorry. I would let him go, this time. But you have to sit him down and tell him that you will speak to your father whenever you damn feel like it, and make sure he understands that.|`|fioNl1k7aa	sounds like you keep provoking him. stop doing this and all will be well.....|`|fRYQfvNaaa	he is an a**hole.    you could tell your parents and have them take care of it.....or you could try to use it to your advantage and make him be very nice to you lol|`|Rv1ujwb0aa	u should tell ur mom cuz if he does it once he will do it again|`|36e4d7dcd3f330db20dbde1dea2b86e6aa	He's a basta*d, you did nothing wrong, don't blame yourself. Your Mom needs to know about this.|`|9Sq22Sneaa	That is soo wrong. You NEED to tell your mom because if you don't it won't be the last time I'm afraid. I think the best thing for you to do is to go live with your dad. And tell your step dad to **** off|`|8o46SYApaa	i believe that you should tell your mom and call the police for child abuse.....things could get worse....that was a just a little taste but it could get worser than that..so snitch before its too late.....tell your mom and the police on that guy cuz he has  no rights to tell you who talk to especially your biological father....|`|W07vMTQvaa	Tell your mom.  If she doesn't do anything about it, tell another adult.  He feels bad because he doesn't want you to tell.

y6v4ztM8aa	if ur parents r chill bout then they might jsut talk to u about how bad it is. but if they dont do anything most likly they r keeping a very eye on you. so either trash ur ciggeretts or sell them. stop smoking. if u do smoke do it somewhere know one u know or ur parents know can see you. but i reccamend stop smoking.|`|aRIA86D8aa	Be honest. The moment you try to hide anything, not just the smoking, your parents will know you're hiding something and their trust of you will fly out the window.     Why would you want to smoke anyway? Stop now, trust me it isn't as cool as you may think. It's a constant hassle and a constant embarrassment.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	Own up.  Being dishonest will make you look  even more irresponsible than you already  do.    I'm guessing it's not legal for  you to smoke yet, so you're gonna have  to tell them how you got your cigarettes too.|`|a5VLn2cWaa	keep your mouth shut and wait to see their reaction. hope your friend isnt in too much trouble and hope friends parents keep their mouths shut when it comes to your parents. when things are cool make sure to apologize to friends parents.|`|kLYXrYh2aa	well if its not pot who really cares.|`|IUAN2Pgeaa	DONT SMOKE!!!!!!!!!!  UNLESS YOU WANT TO DIE|`|uxrFOOn9aa	well first off yuck!! somking is not only bad for you its just gross! ok so im not going to nag you on the stuff im sure you have already heard and didnt listen to before. 1st you need to appologise to them and then i would say go home if you are staying over there its time to head on home and take the punking from your parents that im going to assume will be waiting for you b/c im gonna guess your friends parents are going to contact them. good luck buddy and kick the smelly habbit.|`|KWWL5coyaa	Yea what the third person said!!    But please inform me why the he'll do you smoke? It makes no sence to me. Is it cool to die? Is it cool to have tar in your lungs? How bout not being able to play sports cuz you suck at breathing. Do you like smelling like ****? Or do you just want to be a rebel and smoke because it's illegal? Well you can smoke at 16 but still.      Smokeibg makes no sence to me at all. Is getting high that big of a deal?       But as for your parents, if your 16 just say it's not illegal to smoke (sorry if my facts are wrong but I'm sure it's 16) that's basicly your best excuse and you were just trying it out and you didn't like it and you will never do it again.       But unless you can convince me to smoke then you shouldn't smoke. Try to convince me why do you smoke?|`|h0UUG7MAaa	that sucks hardcoree|`|3ctchU2faa	Be happy you get grounded so you won't be able to go out and pick up the habit.
DjircW6waa	It's very difficult to have an open conversation about feelings like these without getting defensive or angry or emotional.  Try writing her a letter.  Really think through what you want to say to her. Give her very specific examples of what she's said that has hurt you.  Be sincere, not accusatory.  Tell her that you wonder whether living with your dad would be a better place for you.  Be Careful!  Do not say this unless you really believe it and are willing to follow through.  Most likely your mom is under stress that is making her so short-tempered.  If you genuinely express that she's hurting you, I would predict she will try hard to change that.  If not, talk to your dad.  If he's willing to pursue primary physical custody, the court usually takes the child's preference into account at your age.  This shouldn't be used to get back at your mom, but only as a last resort.  Give her a chance to fix it before you do something drastic.  Good Luck|`|SgKsHxD5aa	i know exactly what you mean when your saying she only focuses on what is wrong... when my sister was 19 she got pregnant, and she decided not to get an abortion, not to put it up for adoption, and to raise it with her bf. but she wasnt married, and my mom cant focus on how well she handled the situation, shes stuck on how she got into a bad situation.     all i can say is dont stress, and hope someday your a better, more laid back parent...|`|hDAoKmjPaa	thats how my grandfather is so i kinda know how you feel.. i really dont know how to handle it but to do your best. try not to let her get to you. or if you want you can talk to her and eplain to her that what she is doing to you is really hurting you. tell her that you try your best and your best should be good enough for her. im so sorry tho sweetie i hope you can talk to her and figure out a way to work it out. sometimes benting and getting it all out and talking to someone helps. talk to your friends or your dad or any other family members that you can. just dont hold it all in.|`|2TDtOdltaa	omg ur mom is exactly like mine! it's so weird! but yea my motivation for putting up with my bitchy other is that i won't have to deal w/ it when i'm 18. lol so just hang in there. :)|`|DiWtE0Ksaa	Omg i just answerd one i think it was u morgan !!  just talk to her or wait till u move on to ur own house!!
tqNU60RVaa	yeah, it would because then you would always be around them. here what you should do: wear extra tight clothes when his friends are over, that will make them want you even more.[if you can do that, some mom are very strict about tight clothes policy]. start making out with one of his friends right in frontt of him.|`|aRIA86D8aa	Why would you punish your cousin by sleeping with one of his friends? You sound really confused. I think you should forget about your cousin and go somewhere else. Go somewhere with good friends that care about who you are and what you do.    If you're carrying on with your cousin and trying to make him jealous, you're being immature and sorry but you're also being stupid. He is your cousin, nothing more.|`|G5Xf3vm5aa	do whatever makes him blow up. stick to him like glue. meaning annoy him so much it like your super glue

ScEG7QEjaa	-Giftcards(Jamba Juice,her favorite store,.....)    I always LOVE giving my close friends personalized gifts. You could get them a small goodie bag(Including an issue of their favorite magazine,their favorite snack,drink,candy,...)    I also make my friends CD's. Just make a playlist on Itunes of their favorite songs, and download them onto a CD!    If you have any good pictures of you two together(as well as a seperate picture of you), make a collage or a scrapbook. I made this for a friend and all It costed was ink to print out pictures. She loved it!|`|9cYqY6vWaa	it depends on what she likes. bracelets are nice... me and my bff have this thing for bracelets... particularly bangles and we always 'steal' them from each other (we just borrow for a long time, not actually steal).     a random idea that me and my friends do... since we're kinda short on money/love weirdish random things we usually get each other cute socks, like knee highs with cute patterns or toe socks or something weird but cute!    me and my bff also love making little random doodles on a piece of paper, random pictures with words and references to insiders, with recent pics taped to it... those are really cute.     idk. these are all the things me and my friends love and are obsessed with. i would recommend chapstick and nail polish but i realize that we probably like way different things that you do.|`|KHyPqJviaa	ok i am 15 and i would like mabe a cool t-shirt jewlry  some type of cd or points to buy stuff on itunes you can make her something with bff on it like jewlry or something. or buy her dinner lol thats always good.|`|h0UUG7MAaa	she's you BFF think of what she likes and get her that :)  but for me i would lovee a card to buy stuff on itunes|`|rP1OWD38aa	How about BFF jewelry?

Give her a hug and a kiss in the morning and tell her you love her and she will be so happy, maybe she'll let you go next time!|`|bbSZl7kJaa	It could be a lot worse.

JvxwNufDaa	Yeah, I just asked a question like this like last week. I totally agree.   I've even seen men love their children more than they're wives|`|yGwda7wPaa	I definitely agree with you.  I will always love my kids, no matter what happens.  That is unconditional love.  Their father cheated on me and is now married to someone else.  So, go figure.  My children are my best friends.  We stick together through thick and through thin.  There is nothing wrong with your thoughts.  However, it is difficult to quantify love.  For example, I have a hard time when people love one child more than another.  Love is love.  I love both of my children equally, even though they are different relationships.|`|020600304fdab18bd45030f27f3c19adaa	It is perfectly normal. I mean your children are a part of yourself: your very own blood. Nothing they do can ever make you stop loving them. I can think of a few things a husband can do to make you stop loving him. I would think it abnormal if you said you loved your husband more than your children.|`|sCGWcJTFaa	Kids are your future so you should love them more cause they need it.|`|bYU77eteaa	No the other people are nuts actually...Its nature to love and protect your children even from your husband if you have to.  If you have to choose between the safety of your man or the safety of your child...babies are suppose to win...if you think something otherwise, you are an unfit mother|`|wgCINuZvaa	I don't think it does at all...ur prolly one of the better parents out there. Good for you! :D|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	no, its fine because mothers have a natural intuition to their children its fine, a mother's love is very strong|`|SawySuLRaa	You are o.k. to feel this way.|`|CIOayGDJaa	you should love your kids more than your husband because your kids need more attention. kids should really come first.
Blh3T9HGaa	lol  i gotta say this id go down there and beat **** out of them lol ok ima give u advice call police on them tht there threating u id even take to court if i was in your place because your right u shouldent be pushed by others. They come up again be like i aint affraid of you because when your leing your gonna get it back i got kids they make noise gotta problem you can leave.But dont threating me thats one thing you wont do.   Dude as long as your saying the truth you got nuffing to lose and i no people these days do this alot kdis at school do this to my son hes short so they come up random and try to make fun of em but he has people on his side and he stands up.Take any acction you can for your family if theres any rooms by your apartment you can move there. i no thats not right thing but saying i hope i help you|`|diQ0oodqaa	Are you renting from these people? If not, I would try talking to the landlord about it, maybe he/she will go talk to them and straighten if out. Children are children, and they shouldn't be blamed or fussed about because they run, stomp or whatever. These people need to accept that you live there now and chill out.    If they do call social services or police on you, just tell them what you told us--they are smart enough to know what these people are doing, or trying to do to you. Hang in there, I wouldn't move unless it became dangerous to my family to live there, and if they try something like that or damage something of yours--You call the police and report them. Gosh, I'm so glad I live alone out in the boonies!!|`|020600304fdab18bd45030f27f3c19adaa	Sounds like you need to report this threatening behaviour to the police.|`|m936qdlDaa	tell them to suck balls|`|h01weUiIaa	god i hate upstairs neighbors control your kids think about others they paid rent too do they make noise|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Thats why my husband and i got a downstairs apartment so we wouldn't bug people. Everyone has to realize it's an apartment, they're gonna hear people's lives sometimes.   I'd definitely see if the manager can make sure you don't get kicked out for pickiness, and maybe get them to ok a short letter that you've written to the downstairs neighbors, explaining that kids are just loud, and maybe, to act nice, act if there's a CERTAIN time that they would like you to try to be quiet. Then they feel like they have a little control... cuz that's what they want it seems.   I would suggest moving as soon as you can, maybe a townhouse, with no upstairs neighbors.  Living next to jerks really sucks, so I feel for you. They should live in a condo with HOA|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Apartment living can pose interesting challenges.  There are several issues unique to this current situation. Patterns of incidents require documentation by law enforcement.  Contact police to report any verbal or written intimidation.      Start a journal to record each incident and report.  Under these circumstances it may be prudent to record every contact with adverse neighbors.   Do not rely on memory to identify or recall adverse activities or events involving neighbors.  Use a composition book to maintain a record of contacts and incidents..    Threats in any form are inappropriate and unacceptable.  Do not counter threaten or respond to intimidation.  Police maintain record of false and valid calls to an address.    Children will be do what children do, keep active and busy.  A child friendly environment is ideal for successful upbringing.  Consider more agreeable residential arrangements for peace of mind.     Moving and relocation is extra work,  It easier to move than continue skirmishes with neighbors.  Child friendly living arrangements are will worth the effort.|`|ae4afccd58f1ebbb8504d0dea2b6cd7faa	talk to your landlord see what they can do about it.|`|AA10065175	She knew the risk of takin a bottom apartment, kids r gonna b kids, so whtever...show her u aren't threatened, and tell her 2 get over it or move her damn self|`|SawySuLRaa	You should get out of your lease and move. Those people are mean and will do anything to hurt you. They are not good people.|`|OujY7GcDaa	Even though you don't want to be pushed around you might have to move or you might get your kids taken away! :0 Or you can tell your landlord or something if they can be kicked out. If the guy threatened to hurt you then call the police or put cameras in your house so if he ever does anything it will be on camera for the poliece to see but hide the camera like in a teddy bear or a vase or something! Good Luck! :)|`|opZTyykPaa	get them out or call the popo|`|Mj0BA4Yvaa	Use vaseline to grease-up their walkway in front of their door and put some on their doorknob so they can't get back inside.  Also, use the vaseline on the windshield of their car and on their car door handles.  After they clean it up, wait until they leave and then push tooth pics into the keyhole of their front door.  They won't be able to get back in without calling a locksmith or breaking down their door.  Keep this up for a few weeks, be creative!|`|JVHCFXXVaa	They're blowing smoke trying to scare you into complying or moving. Save any threatening messages or letters they send you and ignore them. They have ZERO to go on as far as reporting you and no agency will take what they say seriously without some kind of proof. Just smile when they rant and rave and save those messages! You pay rent just like they do so it's YOUR "home" as well as theirs so they will have to deal with it.|`|gsg1zDZyaa	Save the threatning letter and if you still have the voicemail save that as proof then call the police to tell them your being harrassed by your neighbors. I seriously doubt anything can happen to you as long as you dont have a history of abusing your wife or children and they DO have a history of being a pain in the ***.  If that doesnt work, why not have a bit of fun with it? **** with them a little once or twice. They want a pain in the ***? Be one. Just make sure it cant come back to you if they try to get authorities involved.  Childish? Yes. Satisfying? Hell yeah.
020600304fdab18bd45030f27f3c19adaa	Well it seems trust is the issue here. If you cannot trust him then this relationship is doomed from the outset. If it's not her there will be someone else with whom you wouldn't trust him with and this inevitably will out tremendous pressure on the relationship. Figure out whether you trust him or not and that will help you make your decision.|`|z08jBhoqaa	Try talking to him about it and how you feel. If you guys were made for each other, he will understand.     Best of Luck|`|SawySuLRaa	DUH!|`|opZTyykPaa	i think you should stay with him, even he likes her you need to be able to trust a boyfrend... i think thats the best option
Tp4jFDWdaa	Who do you like the most? You can't give in to people just because you don't want to hurt them. It just doesn't work that way.  Your best friend, as far as I can tell, should be happy that you're happy. I've learned that the hard way.|`|isPxtl3oaa	stay true to ur man. dating brothers of exs is just dodgy.
020600304fdab18bd45030f27f3c19adaa	Confront her. Of course not in an aggressive way. You need to sit her down and tell her how you feel. Perhaps she isn't even aware that she is being critical of you.|`|4boTYkt7aa	She's your boss,so just go along with it.Unless she becomes abusive,then go over her head to her boss and make a complaint.|`|opZTyykPaa	talk to your boss and try fixing it without any further problems being created
