20070311202937AAAO7Fs	Arts & Humanities;History	What does this passage mean in John Stuart Mill's essay On liberty?	To make any one answerable for doing evil to others, is the rule; to make him answerable for not preventing evil is, comparatively speaking, the exception....   How does this have to do with liberty?   well yeah. but the rule is making him answer to something he has done which is an act of evil. but how is to make him answerable for not preventing evil and exception??

20090304064531AATicIT	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Another writing.  Critique?	I'm anxious, too worried to do anything.   I could pace and feel my heart race all day.   It's not like that would differ from the usual.      I'm energetic, ecstatic even.   I could take on the world and win.   Today I'll be proactive. Today I'll take initiative and do something.   With positivity like this nothing could possibly go wrong.   Better smoke some weed first though...      This feeling of comfort and safety is so real and reassuring.   I should probably do something to ensure the stability of these feelings.   Never mind, I'm way too content to worry about now.      Disappointment, I feel consumed by it now.   I suppose it's almost completely, if not fully, my own fault that I must endure the harsh consequences of my decision to place all my bets and trust into one idea.   The odds appeared so swayed to my favor, but I mistook generosity for stupidity and now I feel just like a ******* fool.

Scrambled patterns lead to one thing and then another   The supporting statements of one force the other force under cover   And I wonder why it seems that everything's losing it's luster,   when it seems to me there's nothing standing now, except for just her.      There's so much static in this reality half-way virtual   The numbing's now second-nature and it's difficult to see through.   With so much stimulation to redirect my consciousness I'm not blessed   There's no test. And now I can't even see you.

20090227024424AAAd7Ef	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Okay, okay, help me edit this. No haters please.?	Okay. It's a fanfic on New Moon-Edward's point of view-and it takes place right after Edward left Denali. In other words, this is the part where Edward was in Denali at Tanya's house. Please do help me edit. I could send the whole story to you if you want.      I was at the little meadow behind her house, thinking about Bella. I missed her dreadfully, even when I only left for a day.   “Thinking of Bella again?” Alice asked promptly.   I nodded and looked up into the sky.   “I bet she was heartbroken like you,” she complained. She missed Bella too.   I wanted to shout at Alice to gain some relief. In the end, I said a few very long sentences.   “Alice, I miss Bella so much… It was as if I’m in hell since yesterday. The pain of leaving her…it was unbearable, Alice. I miss Bella. I want her back. I…I…I want Bella to be with me, forever. You knew that Alice. It just so happened that I’m a danger to her. I only wanted to be with Bella…” The words came out like a river, no, like an ocean. Alice was quiet, too.   She was my best friend too, Edward. You’re not the only one missing her. She looked sad, like me.   Alice gave me a very tight hug. I hugged her back.   “Let’s keep Bella at the most bottom of our hearts,” I whispered.   “Yes. Let’s,” Alice whispered, too.   It was wrong to hurt the people I loved like this. Although I think it was a right decision to make, and yet I hurt so many people already. I began to suspect that I made a wrong decision.   “Are you okay, Alice?” I asked.   No I’m not, but never mind. I could withstand it, she soothed me.   “We shouldn’t be thinking about Bella anymore. Don’t worry, I wouldn’t peep into her window and watch her sleep,” I said.   Alice nodded lightly.   “But she would try to kill herself or something, we-” she said.   “Bella promised,” I said slowly. “Don’t be looking for her future, either,” I continued. “We’ve done enough damage.”   I don’t want Alice to come and tell me that Bella started a new life and had a new boyfriend. I wouldn’t – and I couldn’t – accept that fact.   “Oh well,” Alice sighed. “I guess that’s true.” Don’t worry; I won’t do anything stupid like you.   I was sad enough not to reply to her thoughts. She ignored me and went on.   I am so attuned to her, I couldn’t say anything like “yes, I wouldn’t look into her future.” Her future comes to me. I don’t need to look for it. She cried.   “That’s so unbearable,” I muttered to myself.   Edward, you better think positive now. Thinking about all sorts of nonsense wouldn’t help, you know, she shouted at me.   “Why am I even a vampire,” I continued mumbling to myself.   Edward, ENOUGH, you moron. You’re telling the whole world not to think about Bella and now you’re thinking about her! Stop it! Now! Her thoughts were as loud as thunder.   “I wanted to stop, but I couldn’t…” I mumbled to myself again.   What if Bella died? Alice asked furiously.   My eyes lit up in horror.   “Alice, how could you…” I cried.   You haven’t answered my question yet. What if Bella died?   “I don’t know!” I complained. “I’ll go die, too, I will, I swear.” I said.   Stupid, sick love.   “I don’t care. I’m leaving now. So goodbye,” Alice said silently. She then mumbled something like “stupid Edward”.   I lied down in the meadow and stared up into the sky. The stars were gone today. All that’s left was the darkness, not even the moon was in sight. It was exactly what I felt now, dark and lonely, without any support.   I heard light footsteps coming towards me. I pounced up immediately, surprised to see Tanya looking at me.   “Edward, you’ve been such a fool,” she exclaimed. “Alice told me everything.”   “That’s her own opinion,” I stated carefully.   “Let me tell you a story,” she said very calmly. She lied down on the tender grass, looking into the sky. I lied down beside her, wondering what she was trying to say.   She begins her story when I settled down.   “I was in love with a human before, too,” she started. “We were in love with each other. I never told him I was a vampire.” she stopped, waiting for my response.   “Then,” I asked, eager to know the next part of the story.   “One day, I bit him accidentally because I haven’t hunted in a long time,” she paused. “I pulled away immediately, but he knew I was a vampire. He never hated me, but he loved me more instead.” I wandered what was the relevance between her case and my case.   “So what?” I said.   “You should listen to the rest of the story,” she explained. “So I pulled away. But from that moment onwards I knew that vampires and humans couldn’t be together.”   Finally, somebody who supported me.   “But,” she continued. “I did not leave him. He…One day, I bit him again. But this time, I sucked all the blood out of him…” she trailed off.   “Sorry that you have to tell me that story,” I apologized.   “I let it down, unlike you. You should learn not to blame yourself on everything. I let it go, because it was my nature. I suck blood, and I killed the one I loved for it. I let it go, because his blood stayed in me,” she said

La lutte acharnée de l angoisse, dans la mollesse des gris qui n'en finissent jamais de se gonfler d’innocence sous les sabots enragés de la cavalerie hystérique, vous assaille de vertiges. Les bêtes se cabrent et s’enfoncent, hennissant de douleur sous l’éperon du condamné .       Retenant l’instant pour un dernier souffle, les  yeux du dément cherche la douce, celle qui aime, celle qui sauve, celle qui se sacrifie — dernier espoir    Mais sa main, restée vide, il disparait, lentement, englouti dans le mouvant du ciel, repliant les doigts sur sa peine, laissant échapper la larme du pardon.       Dans la blancheur de l’astre qui vous  transperce comme une lame de fond , vos yeux se baissent, fixant la vague noire qui s’éclate sans fin sur le néant de votre  ame et vous déchire, vous tord dans un cri de folies inaudibles.      L’Inébranlable roc dissimule l’impuissance de votre être, il est le marbre de votre tombeau , sanctuaire des vers affamés qui vous bouffent et les relents de pourriture de votre c?ur momifié se noient dans le sang maudit qui vous brule.   Cette bouche trop maquillée singe votre innocence et vous absorbe . Mascarade d’un égout cultivant vos vers, vous n’etes que les mouches grises de ses festins éphémères   L’espoir d’une ame promettant l over dose n’est il pas une chimère ?

Yet every setting sun is but one occasion lost   A slipping chance from our unclenching fists.   How regretful!

20090227032020AA4YBwZ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story im writing?	the clipping is of a romance part of the story. its taken somewhat out of context, so im looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. the "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name of develop. any constructive crit is appreciated. the word family here means a strong group of friends. it is only a draft so far, so don't expect any extremely beautiful grammar.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "i missed you...a lot. for some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. heh. i often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   i found myself looking down. i was embarrassed by what i said. i sounded like such a loser and so desperate. i was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "i did think of you. i thought i was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   i went blank. all i could do now was stare through her in amazement. i found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "thank you", she said.   "for what?"   "for missing me."   i let out a breath of a laugh."why wouldnt i miss you?"   "why would you?"   "i love you". as i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   i knew i had to say something. i couldn't help what i just said. i had to change this moment. i had to make something out of this. i had to recover from this mistake.   "i hope that didn't come out too cheesy. i spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "hey..stop talking." she cut me off. i was ready for a verbal lashing. i felt terrible and sick. after all she went through, i should be aware of her feelings. it was so obvious. what was i thinking. was i thinking? these thoughts raced through my head so fact that i COULDN'T think. i attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "i love you too."   i felt like i went dead.

20090227031217AAd53Dt	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good story idea?	A young girl (Mandy) lives a typical life. She doesn't have many friends at school, and is pretty anti-social. At home, her mother has just got married to her boyfriend (Gary), yet Mandy is curious of him..   One day, she wakes up to a lot of noise. As she emerges from her room, there are many strangers in her home. One comes over and takes Mandy back to her room, and explains her mothers sudden death. Gary is in the hall in tears and talking to one of the police officers. Mandy knows that it was him but nobody will listen to her.   At school her depression leads to bad school work, arguing, and even fights. In fact, one fight so bad, that she falls from the window of her classroom. She hits the ground with great force, as everything blacks out..   When she opens her eyes next, she finds herself back at home, in bed back to the date her mum died. She runs into her mums bedroom to find Gary sitting over her mum, with a pillow pressed furiously against her face.   Then blah blah blah.. big fight, she stops him, the police arrest him and Mandy's the hero. (Long story, short)      Is that ok for a story? Any ideas for improvements? :S   Or other character names?

When one man forgets the rest will suffer: a post it         It is easy - I would imagine -   Even for the non-dreamer to dream   Of perfumed princesses all standing,   In unbridled adoration, each pink, painted   Lip   Puckering   And   Quivering,   In anticipation   Each knee suspended in some schoolgirl juxtaposition   Awaiting the moment   To bow in obeisance   To another man made success   Another of the titans   The gods   A face to be squeezed between bubblegum sticks    In wrappers of baseball cards.      And for those who see the blind mans knuckles   Swipe past as stained fingers reach   Out for his preservation-grip,   The princesses have taken second   Seat to a meal or scrap of junk   To barter with for one slice   Further   Of some pie he eats   To squelch recognition   Pangs.      But the princesses dance along to some    Different tune and coerce yet another   To stray from umbilical bliss,   To become unattached from the   Easy clench   The warm cradle   The soft palm   Of the mothers hands   And be thrust forth into the   Vacuum of second beginning   To reach with stained fingers   As the blind man grasps.
20090227034239AASZ0SO	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Another poem for critique...good and bad welcome, thanks. sorry its long?	Memories of chickens on sawtelle blvd.      Often on walks down the   Street I will reside on for one more week   I will treat my    Lately depression starved   Stomach to a vanilla   Ice cream cone at   The neighborhood McDonalds   And as I walk into the glass door I smell   The meat cooking immediately   And I am sickened   And I hold my breath and stare   At the floor to take my mind to   Another place, only to find   It wandering to the countless   People who walked on piss and   Graced the McDonalds tile   With the presence of their piss   Boots.   And when I am two spots away from my turn at the    Register I look in the back   To see the yard bird in the fryer.   And I am taken back to   A run down drag strip   In Dinwiddie, Virginia   The remanants of segregation painted    Sill on the walls directing members of   Uncle sams lower caste where to step in piss.   And a grandfather has taken me and he stands    So much larger than my eight year old frame.   And he smokes cigarettes that smell like   Mints and he wears a brown members only   Jacket, and he whispers things to me between the races,   Anecdotes that cannot be recalled for poetry,   Only when needed in real life capers.   And he buys me a piece of fried chicken,   And I sit in the stands, and the engines ring   Pierces my ears and the sting scares me and makes me   Hunker in on the old man, who likes it. He wants me to know   Hes one of the ones who will teach me, but I do not know   It yet. And I tear away the greasy   Skin of the chicken,   And I expose its flesh,   And their amidst the shiny white   Was its vein.   A vein,   It carried blood,   Even the feeble mind   Knows the weight of this truth.   I was going to eat   Something that lives.   It has blood in it,   It has a heart.   What am I doing…   And I threw the chicken between the bleachers.      And I would later eat many more pieces of chicken.   But not that one   Not that day.      The bird was most   Likely consumed   By other birds.   And the thought of that.   Not saving it further embarrasment by   Taking its flesh to   The garbage   Still plagues me.      And now my turn at the register has come and    Gone, and my mind has settled   And I lick the vanilla melting    Over my knuckles.   And I begin to remember a man   In a brown members only jacket,   Smoking cigarettes that smelled   Like mint.

20090305073617AAyfeLj	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why were the things that were funny then, not funny now?	I recently watched a couple of sit-coms from my youth that I thought were really funny at the time, but now not only are they not funny, they were kind of stupid and silly.    Does humor/comedy "age"? Like even the big hits for sitcoms on tv back then, would never be funny now, let alone big hits in today's times.   Like take a show like A.L.F, Family Ties, Night Court, or Perfect Strangers that were huge back when I was a kid/teen, but would be unfunny flops if they tried coming out now for the first time.      It makes me think of what kind of things will be funny in future generations, ya know?   Do you still think the stuff you thought was funny a while back are still funny today OR that today's times would think they are funny?      And if you want to answer, what do you think makes something "funny" to people in general??
20090305062832AARI0w9	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is your 'heart'?	and how is it separate from your soul, mind or spirit?       We talk so much about what our heart wants and what our heart does, but I've never understood what it actually is. How did we ever associate such abstract things with an organ that pumps blood?       On another note: I watched a panel of doctors on TV talk about this theory that the heat (organ) actually stores memories and that perhaps your memories are stores or impressed upon all of your organs because there have been cases where people receive a transplanted organ and it will spark memories, or new personality traits in them.       I've also heard that your heart has it's own magnetic pull.       All this made me wonder if our abstract idea of the heart has a much more concrete reality behind it than we ever thought.       I started wondering all of these things last night in my bible study when we read the verse "above all else guard your heart" and I asked the girls, "What is your heart? and how the hell am I supposed to guard it?"   Nobody seemed to know..

Sorrows Become Me      I remember clearly   Long ago and far away   You kissed my cheek tenderly   Whispered words I can’t say      You held me waiting   For my words to ring yours true   Caught just a breath away   Those words I’d surely rue      ‘Good night,’ was my answer   To the love you’d expressed   Hurt you seemed   But I could expect nothing less      ‘Good night…’ you said in sorrow   As you then turned to leave   Those words hammered in my ears   Demanding for release      I love you… I love you   More than life could know   I love you with all I could love you   But for fate, I could not show      I remember your soft sway   As you turned at your door   You smiled reverently then   And set my heart to soar      In that smile   Your love touched my soul   Silent promise   For my love untold      Years came slowly   In the warmth of your life   For every moment I cherished   Even times of strife      Though still caught by fear   Of what fate should do   If I so much as muttered   My dear, I love you…      I love you with all I could love you   And dare not utter a word   For fear the fates will hear me   And take you away for sure      ‘I love you,’ you murmured   Soft words against my ear   Sleep then enfolded you   And I hugged you oh, so near      Each rise and fall against me   The beating of your heart   Love so amazing   But fate had its part      I watched you sleep beside me   The joy beyond mere words   Could fate really take you?   Could love be assured?      Soft rhythmic breathing   Fear overwhelmed by joy   I uttered it so silently   Fate heard not a noise      And surely as the days went by   And fate never stirred   Love, I thought, had made it through   Three little words…      I love you…   Dear God,   I love you…   And fate heard the lot      I love you with all I could love you   Those words… I never should   For fate readily heard me   And took you away for good      But even now, I remember   The smile that lit your eyes   Those words that I whispered   As I hugged you to my side      A smile so radiant   At my love spoken true   You were so elated   And thought you broke me through      But, dear one…      The moment I saw you   To this day today   I’ve loved you forever   Forever and always…      I love you with all I could love you   And should not have uttered a word   Fate so cruel and timeless   On those words are cursed      I find now I can whisper those words more freely   For I whisper those words alone   White rose in hand, I stare at your name   In the pillar made of stone…      ~end

20090305063859AAPIXTg	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you say to a belligerent moon?	A Belligerent Moon      A belligerent moon stalked the shadows that night,   seeking out vampires to impale with her light.   She puffed up her cheeks and whistled a breeze,   startled the bats that hung high in the trees.      Winged creatures bemoaned Luna's cold stare,   flew hither and thither, fleeing her glare.   Demented demons cursed as they scurried,   Luna kept strolling her pace never hurried.      Why, nothing could hide from the light of her truth.   Not those with webbed wings, nor those with sharp tooth.   Luna loomed large in the sky on that night,    seeking out vampires to impale with her light.

Thought it is old, I love the shine.   The engine's revs proclaim my feat      Though I go slowly, it’s no matter   Its creaks and clatters get me high   Eye candy that can easily flatter.   Oils leaks and splatters, yet it’s my buy.      No cops in sight, so I'll take flight.   Peel out on tar, to mar its dark   Slipping clutch, into the night   Spinning tires leave my mark.

At the Dharasana Salt Works, why do the people keep going up to the gate when they know they will be beaten?       I rewatched and rewatched it, but I didn't see them get beaten...only when those people are being hit for some reason, and than the riot comes and kills the British soldiers.

20090305071358AAzxdL7	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	I NEED YOUR HELP!!! All dancers and dance parents!?	I'm working on putting together an online database called "Find A Dance Studio". You can go to the site, enter your city and state, and a map will show you the dance studios nearest to you.       The problem is, it's hard for me to put a dance studio in EVERY city of EVERY state.       Now here's where you come in. There are two things you could do;      1. go to www.findadancestudio.com and search for your city/state, if there isn't a dance studio there, look at the right side of the page, where it says "Let us know"; click that. You don't have to enter your address or phone number, just send a message saying that there aren't any studio's in your city, and I will make it a priority to find at least 2.      2. Check to see if YOUR dance studio is on www.findadancestudio.com if it isn't, please click the "Let us know" link and send me a message telling me the city, and the name of your studio, or any studio's you know of that weren't on the site.         If you don't want to e-mail me through the site, just send me an e-mail!      Alexis@findadancestudio.com

20090305073633AADh8aU	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story im writing?	the clipping is of a romance part of the story. its taken somewhat out of context, so im looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. the "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name of develop. any constructive crit is appreciated. the word family here means a strong group of friends. it is only a draft so far, so don't expect any extremely beautiful grammar.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "i missed you...a lot. for some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. heh. i often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   i found myself looking down. i was embarrassed by what i said. i sounded like such a loser and so desperate. i was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "i did think of you. i thought i was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   i went blank. all i could do now was stare through her in amazement. i found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "thank you", she said.   "for what?"   "for missing me."   i let out a breath of a laugh."why wouldnt i miss you?"   "why would you?"   "i love you". as i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   i knew i had to say something. i couldn't help what i just said. i had to change this moment. i had to make something out of this. i had to recover from this mistake.   "i hope that didn't come out too cheesy. i spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "hey..stop talking." she cut me off. i was ready for a verbal lashing. i felt terrible and sick. after all she went through, i should be aware of her feelings. it was so obvious. what was i thinking. was i thinking? these thoughts raced through my head so fast that i COULDN'T think. i attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "i love you too."   i felt like i went dead.

Among buzz-top poplars   Stung with a breeze,      Choked up with bird chants   And drowned in the mist:      You, chest deep in yellow   Blooms, following your nose      Smartly through the clover.   Me, perched on summer      Grass, empty as a leopard;   Blue with sword and shield.      Both of us sneezing, gloomy:   Gathering dew like mushrooms,      Listening to the rake of crows,   Insects dead-scuttling in holes.         Charming Gremlin, wrinkle head; the whole mountain is rotten with light!  All the forests blush with mythical creatures!  In huge clearings you can hear the river sigh, the mischievous Goddess will come soon to drink.  Lets throw down our weapons, our torn-skinned jewel quests;  We'll dance like les-enfants!

20090305072737AA1bMI2	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	The Unknown Citizen by Wystan Hugh Auden?	He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be   One against whom there was no official complaint,   And all the reports on his conduct agree   That, in the modern sense of an old-fashioned word, he was a saint,   For in everything he did he served the Greater Community.   Except for the War till the day he retired   He worked in a factory and never got fired,   But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.   Yet he wasn't a scab or odd in his views,   For his Union reports that he paid his dues,   (Our report on his Union shows it was sound)   And our Social Psychology workers found   That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink.   The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day   And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way.   Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured,   And his Health-card shows he was once in hospital but left it cured.   Both Producers Research and High-Grade Living declare   He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Installment Plan   And had everything necessary to the Modern Man,   A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire.   Our researchers into Public Opinion are content   That he held the proper opinions for he time of year;   When there was peace, he was for peace; when there was war, he went.   He was married and added five children to the population,   Which our Eugenist says was the right number for a parent of his generation.   And our teachers report that he never interfered with their education.   Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd:   Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard.            I understand the poem, he was a perfect man. He had no problems, paid his taxes, insured, good job, kids... but the end kinda threw me off?..any explanation would be nice :]
