QAsT4EKFaa	I am a loan officer in the Northern VA area.  I can tell you that unless you are in some sort of the military, you will need to put down payment into purchasing a home.  If you are military, you could do a VA loan and get 100% financing.  If you aren't military, FHA will be the way to go.  There is no down payment assistance any longer from any kind of non-profit groups such as Ameridream (that went away on October 1, 2008).  As of January 1, 2009, you are required to put 3.50% into the purchase with FHA.  If you have a 401K, you are allowed to borrow against it for the purchase of a home.  If that is not an option, you can get the money gifted to you by a family member.  The other good news for you is that if you purchase your home prior to July 1, 2009, you can get the first time homeowner tax credit of $7,500, so if you do need to reimburse your 401K, you can do it with this money.  It sounds like you will qualify with no problem with your credit and with your income, but make sure you have the down payment in order, if not, you will need to save up for the 3.50% of the purchase price.  The closing cost can be taken care of by the seller.|`|6YVckVa2aa	FHA loans all require the homebuyer to pay mortgage insurance premiums.The amount would depend on your purchase price.  So keep that in mind.   If your credit is good, then you should still be able to buy a home with 100% financing. My friends just closed on a home last month with no down payment. The 3-5 K you have will likely all go towards closing costs. That is about how much closing costs are.   The FHA website has lots of info on their different kinds of loans. If you dont have 10% to put down on your home, then you will likely have to pay mortgage insurance anyway. It can cost anywhere from 100-300 extra a month on top of your mortgage payment.  Hope i was helpful.|`|x9TgRvkbaa	Down payments vary from state to state, in Ohio it's 3.5% of the cost of the home.|`|bh7mrIrqaa	Ask a mortgage broker about down payment assistance programs. I was told about one called AmeriDream and what they do is they take a fee of $500 and act as a nonprofit grant provider between the seller and you.  On a FHA loan, there is a 3% down payment requirement that the seller would contribute to AmeriDream, then it would be "gifted" to you for you down payment.      Most of the sellers will also pay  3% concession towards down payment and closing costs.  You may need to offer at or above their asking price to get them to agree.|`|AA10087853	Sorry if this sounds caustic, but, if you think a $2000+ mortgage payment each month would be such a piece of cake, why do you only have $3k saved up?     Why not get an initial pre-approval now, do more research, get your ducks in a row, and for four months, put aside the money you'd be spending on a mortgage payment. Don't forget taxes, insurance, maintenance, upkeep, utilities. And after just a few months,  you'd have at least $11,000 or more for a downpayment.  Plus, the real estate market is sorta in hibernation during the winter. Many people wait to put their houses on the market until spring/early summer. By then you will have more choices, as well as more money.

OtKMSMn5aa	Stockholders equity is The portion of the balance sheet that represents the capital received from investors in exchange for stock (paid-in capital), donated capital and retained earnings. Stockholders' equity represents the equity stake currently held on the books by a firm's equity investors.    retained earnings refers to the portion of net income which is retained by the corporation rather than distributed to its owners as dividends    Contributed capital shows what has been invested by stockholders through purchase of stock from the corporation

RZzMse3Haa	NO!  You don't pay the lease buyout unless you leave the property before the lease is up.  You are giving 30 days notice that you will leave at the end of the lease.  You are doing things properly.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	I don't see why you would have to. If you are providing proper notice according to the lease, then you owe rent through the rest of your lease term, no more and no less.|`|x9TgRvkbaa	THey want a thirty day notice even if you are moving out by your end date. So, I would go ahead and do that now, bc they may try and charge you a month's rent if you don't.|`|Qk3oflwPaa	I would put in the notice & just state that UR moving out when the lease is up. There are ways to get outta UR lease too.|`|AA10087853	So,  you want to give thirty days notice now, for the end of February? And your lease ends the end of February?     Then you should not have to pay anything.  You are completing the term of your lease, and that's that.  A lease buyout is for situations such as, your lease ends in June but you want to move now.     Remember also that if you paid a last month's rent when you moved in, you will not have to pay February rent out of your pocket now.

s2VFuFdHaa	you would calculate that number by taking your taxable income and multiplying it by your tax rates.  you can look at a simple calculation on IRS.gov to find an easy way to calculate it. a portion of your taxable income will be at 10%, then some at 15% and depending on how much you made, some could be at 25%
Pjm9pg7iaa	If someone will pay you 10% interest if you give them $100, you will give them the money.    If someone will pay you 1% interest if you give them $100, you won't give them the money. The money is more valuable to you to keep in your pocket..|`|AA11598210	~~Go to www.usps.com and click on the shipping rate option.

f0WUWKDraa	what else can you do? i suppose you could look at how the sum is made up - are the notes dirty and unhygienic? is it all in loose change which will be horrible to carry around? are the coins/notes no longer in circulation, so they're actually worthless?  if a pretty girl if offering you $5 and a butt-ugly girl is offering you $10 to help her with her homework, don't you think the pretty girl's offer is more attractive?      or is this a question of financial mathematics? do you have a choice between $100 now and $200 in two years' time? which is more useful to you? if you owe $100 tomorrow and a loan shark is going to break your legs if you don't pay, maybe that's better than waiting 2 years for an extra $100. if not, do you believe that "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"?|`|AA10962298	Not enough information.

z7lg0l7xaa	Well I am a complete and utter procrastinator also.  The thing that i do is that i first figure out what the consequences is if i procrastinate on a certain project. Then i tell myself what im gonna do. for example, if im writing an essay, I'll say that i  ill work on one paragraph or so a day everyday. Give yourself a milestone for each day you work. And work to reach it. I have to divide up my time for how long i have. It isn't the best to work on all the work in one day though because to much work can fry your brain.  work for an amount of hours and then take a break for a little while. But make sure you get back to your work. keep in mind the feeling you get when you turn in work on time versus the feeling you get when you turn in work late.    Hope that helps.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	get a different job?|`|7nGwou8uaa	destroying the tv might help if thats how you procrastinate.  just make it a point to do it and not let yourself down by procrastinating. if the job is important then treat it as such and just do it|`|dd6rgtL7aa	Take a shower when you first wake up in the morning.

You have been given a new opportunity to explore a new place and enjoy the luxury of not commuting!  Look in the mirror and tell yourself you're one lucky you-know-what!      I've been working from home for 6+ years.  I love that I can throw in a load of laundry while working in my slippers.  Just as you would do if you go into an office, set a schedule for yourself and a daily to-do list.  You could even use a project management software like ACE Project and enter your time in their weekly time sheets.  That way, you'll see where your time is spent and whether you're really procrastinating.  You might surprise yourself and find that working from home is really more productive!  The only downside is lack of contact with friends and colleagues.  You'll make new friends in your new place!

You could work in pediatrics (to age 18) and care for an even more specific population, like pediatric oncology or pediatric intensive care or pediatric rehabilitative services. You could be a Public Health nurse and do home visits with immigrant families.     That's just the tip of the iceberg. This is why nursing is such a great career. . . you don't ever have to be bored, there is always something different if you want to make a change. You'll never be without a job.
AbCeEZIhaa	Get an attorney and have them talk to the prosecutor's office or whoever is handling child support cases, sometimes it is a dedicated division. See if they will accept a payment on it, and it will have to be significant I am not going to lie to you, but less than the total arrearage which I assume is her bond? Or is this contempt? If it is contempt there is no bond and is worse.     The courts can let her sit, and I have seen that happen but most often they want the money for the child and someone sitting in jail not working is not doing anyone any good.     Does she have any kind of tax refund check coming at all? If she does, offer it up. I do not know what her mental status is, but if she has to get a paper route and pay $25 a month, I am serious, that will look better than not being able to offer any kind of plan to the court.  That is what they want to hear, something, any kind of plan to get some payments coming in to the child.|`|T8f8C3Tfaa	If she has a mental issue I am sure that there is medical documentation that can support her claim.

Your lease was made in good faith and above-board. If it says dogs are permitted, then dogs are permitted. He can't change the terms on you now.|`|AA10087853	I can understand the landlord's dilemma, but it is HIS problem for allowing you to have the dog and not first making sure that "high-risk" dogs are OK with his insurance company. (Pit bulls are on the blacklist with most insurance companies). It's his mistake, and you're right, his insurance is not your responsibility. He made a boo-boo and wants you to pay for it.     If your lease says the dog is allowed, then you can keep the dog. His insurance oversight is his problem.     Write a polite letter explaining that legally, you are allowed to keep the dog because your lease says so, and tactfully point out that he should have checked with his insurance company before signing a binding contract that allowed the dog. He cannot evict you based on this.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.

gwqS6xHpaa	I am not familiar with your market but here are some legit guesses.    In my community this has greatly affected housing prices in the same city, but different sections.    1 - jobs, has a major employer moved out of the Eastern Section?  2 - was the housing in the Eastern Section new?  Right now, newer housing has dropped much more than older neighborhoods in many cities.  Many times, the older parts of town were already filled with owners who were not speculating (buying a house/condo to flip/sell it in the near future for more money).  Whereas, new housing/suburban expansion never got filled up because it was still being built while the housing market started to crash.  3 - When gas prices shot up in the summer, was living in the Eastern Section a far drive from jobs?  If so, this killed demand among housing there when gas was over $4 dollars a gallon.   4 - If housing in the Eastern County was newer, there has been a serious backlash against "cookie-cutter" developments.

I have sent in disputes for my credit before by typing up my own letter and the credit bureau corrected the error for me.  As far as filing a dispute online, the credit bureau requires you to have a current copy of their report before they will let you submit your dispute.  So if you don't want to mess with the hassle of mailing in your dispute and waiting for a response that it was been corrected then yes, you will have to pay each credit bureau for the ability to dispute online.|`|FFNIThIcaa	buildcredit.ifastnet.com - try this site.

bankzwwYaa	This is an identical question that someone else asked not a day ago... homework??      Retained earnings are the cumulative profit or loss of a company...\    Contributed capital is the $$ proceeds from sale of stock or owner investment..    Shareholder equity is the portion of retained earnings that the shareholders "own"...|`|AA11357056	For a corporation, Stockholders Equity is basically the sum of 1) the original contributed capital used to start the business and 2) any profits from the business that were not paid out as dividends.    Contributed capital is just that... the assets used to start the business. For a corporation, it would be the money received from sale of stock, for a partnership it'd be the assets (cash or otherwise) that each partner 'contributed' to start the business.    Retained earnings is any net income from the business that has not been paid out to partners or shareholders. For example, if a corporation has net income of $1 million and pays out $50,000 in dividends, the remaining $950,000 is retained earnings and added to stockholders equity.

Bw1h5xAcaa	It is a massive process, and CRNA programs don't just take anyone, they want the superstars of nursing. You have to have the highest grades, do volunteer work, leadership activities, etc. They are serious about admissions, for sure.     I (briefly) contemplated going for my CRNA but my committment level was not high enough and I knew I couldn't make it work for me, both personally and financially. Being in the program itself is a full-time job and rarely can you manage to hold down more than an extremely part time job for that two years time.    One word of advice is that if you already hold a BS in another field you could complete an "accelerated BSN" or "post baccalaureate BSN" which could cut your costs and time (you could be done in less than two years) to earn your BSN. You should definitely be able to finish the BSN for less than 45k.

It fell off the map in the last 20 years.  But, there is still good money to be made for young people willing to be their own boss. Some of these jobs involve up front investment not needed to work at the mall.    1 - snow-cone (some people call it Italian Ice) or ice cream cart sales.  My dad did it back in the 1970's in the summer. He borrowed money from his dad to purchase a cold cart and he sold pop and chips from it too. He claims he made a fortune in the summer. Again, up front costs.    2 - In high school, I had a friend who shined shoes at the airport on the weekend. His parents bought him the chair and brushes and initial equipment.  They also contacted the airport and set up the contract.  But, he made enough money to pay his rent to the airport and stay in business til he left for college.    3 - Snow/lawn care.  There are tons of elderly people in our country and baby boomers getting ready to retire.  All you need is to make on flyer and spend $10 at the printing shop (or use your own computer).  Canvas the neighborhood.  Especially hit up the older neighbors you see.   I did this when I was little.  10 dollars to shovel someone's sidewalk at age ten seemed like a fortune.  It was to the point where the neighbors would call me after it snowed, or on the weekends to mow their lawn when it got hot.  Again, you may need to purchase a shovel or two or a used lawnmower - or if you want a good work out and not pay for gasoline and tune-ups a push mower.    You don't have to work at the mall or dairy queen because you are a kid.  Doing one of these lets you make cash on the spot, work as much as you want, and be your own boss.

tNaqdyhtaa	Hi Justin,    The number one question going though thousands of minds - How to make money from home online? A very profitable and easy way is affiliate marketing, described below.    One of the best ways to make money from home online is Internet Marketing.  Because the Internet is enormous there are dozens of different ways to make money online.    Affiliate Marketing is one avenue within Internet Marketing.    Simply put affiliate marketing is advertising. Companies don't want to hire a whole department for advertising. They would have to pay thousands of dollars or more for payroll, insurance, unemployment funds and so on. So instead they set up accounts with trusted affiliate programs.    There is a company called Clickbank, it is an affiliate program, and one of the largest.  Now Clickbank allows individuals to join as an affiliate, which by the way is free to join. From there you can choose over thousands of products to promote online. Once you have a product you then take a special link and post it pretty much anywhere on the Internet. By anywhere I'm referring to forums, chat rooms, blogs, emails, and your own websites. The list goes on and on.

qLvhoRpsaa	A resume is document that should be one page, give brief description of skills, experience or training you have, and your contact information. The interview gets you the job, the resume is supposed to make them want to meet you in person. If you are young or do not have a lot of experience, that is not a bad thing. For intstance, for a clerk or receptionist type of job, you would just give your contact information, your level of schooling, and that you are good with people, have attention to detail, and are looking to find an entry level position. Many employers will train you for their company specifically and the fact that you do not have much or any experience is not a problem. Good Luck with the job search. Google "resume, and job search" and other types of key words and you will find tons of site that give you some great examples of resume's, how to handle an interview, and other good tips for getting the job you are looking for.

For example, if you are applying for a Nursing position, you might want to list your course concentrations at the Nursing school.  For a front office job, I don't think they will care much that you took Biology or Algebra 2.  Just put the name of the school, GPA, what degree you are going for and when you expect to get it.    In your case,  I would put my work experience first (starting with the most recent job). Remember to include volunteer work as well. After work experience, I would put your college experience and H.S. graduation info.    On the other hand, If you had finished nursing school, and were applying for a nursing position, you would put eduation at the top.     Also, create a skills section and list all of the skills that you have that might be useful at the job you are applying for. How fast can you type? Can you speak another language? What PC applications are you familiar with? And so on.

Bw1h5xAcaa	You need to be a Registered Nurse to work in Labor & Delivery, which can be obtained with either an Associate's Degree in Nursing (ADN) or a Bachelor's of Science or Arts in Nursing (BSN or BAN).     Either one makes you eligible for licensure as an RN. BSN grads are often "preferred" in hospitals, but in most places the ADN degree is just fine for starting out and you can complete the BSN at a later time if you choose.    In nursing school they train you in a variety of settings and you will have clinical rotations caring for mothers and newborns and will likely have an observation-only experience in L&D. Once you are licensed as an RN, you can try to get into L&D right away as a new grad, but some birth centers will prefer you have at least a year of experience working in a hospital setting doing patient care (doesn't matter what area, but medical / surgical units are a good place to start).     Most of your education specific to the job of L&D is provided by the employer and your orientation process is lengthy, combining both classroom learning and preceptoring on the units with an experienced RN.    At my hospital I am trained in high risk OB, caring for pregnant women on hospitalized bedrest for various conditions, I also work L&D, and postpartum. But generally at my hospital you are trained to one or two areas where you have your "home" unit. Some smaller hospitals the nurses do all three areas and work wherever there is staffing needs.    For the most part it's a very happy job, unlike many other areas of nursing where you are around the sick, the elderly, etc. Pregnant women are usually relatively self-sufficient and don't need a ton of time and attention. Laboring a patient is nice because you usually only have one patient to focus on and you get to know them well during your shift. Postpartum it's not unusual to care for 4 mom-baby couplets (meaning essentially you have 8 patients total that need assessing and caring for).     Working in high risk I see more than the average number of complications, including stillborn babies, extremely premature babies, babies with congenital defects, etc. It can be very emotionally difficult at times. But there is also great spiritual satisfaction attending to these patients, and I find great meaning in my work caring for these families.     Good luck!|`|lHmfSDIYaa	Several paths to arrive at the destination that you have described.  All of which lead to RN licensure which is what you need.      1. A Diploma Nursing Program (DN): These are nursing programs offered at hospital-owned schools of nursing.  You will take your classes there and do 99% of your clinical rotations within that organization.  The focus here is nursing with minimal academics.  Upon completion, generally about 3 years time, you will receive a diploma and be eligible to sit for the NCLEX.    2. Associate Degree Nursing Program (ADN): These programs are offered by community colleges and take 3 years to complete.  Here, you will get some academics in addition to vocational/clinical training.  The classes here will transfer to other accredited programs which make them priceless if you are interested in pursuing higher education.  Upon completion of this program, you will receive an Associate's Degree and be eligible to sit for the NCLEX.    3. Bachelor's Degree Nursing Programs (BSN):  These programs are offered by 4 year colleges and universities.  They take 4 years to complete and you will receive a Bachelor of Science: Nursing (BSN) degree upon completion and be eligible to sit for NCLEX.    Upon successful completion of NCLEX you will be issued a license to practice as a Registered Nurse in your state of residence.  At that point, you can apply to any nursing job available (you expressed an interest in OB), however, many organizations require 1-2 years experience as a nurse prior to moving into specialty areas.  That is not to say it is impossible, just unlikely with a brand new license and limited experience.    If you are interested in prescriptive previleges, you will need a Master's Degree and additional licensure.    Nursing school is a life-changing experience as you will have very little life outside of school, especially if you need to work.    Good Luck|`|WVigduY5aa	Hi there,  I am a senior nursing student. I think being an OB Nurse is great! I am actually currently doing my OB/Maternity clinical rotation. In the OB unit, you get to go to the mother/baby unit, operation room, clinics and nursery. Maternity is not my thing, but perhaps you will like it?   I think nursing school is tough. There is a lot of information that you really need to study. I remember sleepless nights and sacrificing time with my friends. But, I believe it is all worth it in the end. Just hang in there and if you review your notes and dont slack off, you will do just fine.   I think nursing is a great and rewarding job. I am glad you are considering it. Best of luck    -nursing student-

They work for the bank.  And so they have access to your information in order to sell you things.  If they use the information for bank purposes, in this case, to sell you something, then it's ok.    I'm sure you are wondering what they are trying to sell you...    Your debit card is probably a visa or mastercard.  These companies pay the bank a perimium when their customers use the cards as credit.  The reason for this is because merchants pay a fee to the credit card companies to accept their cards.  So basically, the bank wants you to run the card as credit instead of debit, which is more like using it as an atm, or point of sale.    In a nutshell:  you use your card at a gas station.  gas station pays visa a fee to accept it.  visa pays your bank a fee to get you to use the card as credit more often.|`|mwkfirjRaa	Yes, it's perfectly legal.  You have an account with the bank so that means any bank employee with access to customer records is legally authorized to view your transactions.    What is illegal is if they share that information with other parties that are not affiliates of theirs, or not necessary for conducting business.  For example, it is perfectly legal for them to share your account information with check guarantee companies and the credit bureaus.  They also share your personal financial information with the federal government, and they don't even have to tell you.  This is thanks to the Patriot Act.    But, they cannot share your personal financial information with your neighbors or their friends, for example.  Technically, they are not allowed to share your information with anyone or any company that does not have a legitimate business interest in your account or your transactions.  Sometimes bank employees do - this is considered not only a professional breach but it is also illegal.  Still, it can happen.    You can opt out of letting them share your personal information with their affiliates, and the bank is required by law to inform you once each year of their privacy policy and opt-out provisions.|`|aWeKninEaa	ok I have looked at all of the answers and now I am going to answer I am a personal banker , I work in customer service I don't sell anything I give ideas for instance I would never call you up out of the blue and ask you about your purchases unless i had a idea that would be a better product for you. For instance chatting with a customer noticed she was getting charged a monthly fee for a certain kind of checking account and she was not keeping the balance that she needed therefor getting charged a service fee asked her if she every thought of changing the account and she said yes but the last person that she talked to couldn't. I changed it so she did not have to keep a min balance there for waving the 8.00 month service fee and the account actually earns interest. If a customer calls and want information on their account and we notice that they don't have a debit card or maybe there account is consistently overdrawn we might see if they are interested in overdraft protection I suggest I don't sell.I earn my hourly wage the only thing i get incentives for credit card sales not Debit card sales.A personal banker can see all of your account information it is not their information to give to anyone except that customer. i take a lot of pride in my job because I know my customers come back to me because I care about them and their finances. I take time to know their names what they do their families I even know some of their pets. I really hope they were doing their job but I would have never called you for this reason.

MbzyriZ4aa	You can deposit it... but I would wait at least 10 days after the check clears and the amount is actually posted to your account before making any withdrawals.    To spot a Scam:    Did you expect to get this check?     If yes, OK.... if it comes out of the blue... most likely a scam.    Are they asking you to cash it and send them a portion of the check to cover fees?    If yes.... definitely a scam. The check will bounce within 10 days after you cashed it and the bank will want their money back from you.  While you already sent most of the check via Western Union Wire back to the scammers.    If you think it is a scam... then take the letter and the check to the police station.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	It is a well-made counterfeit check. It will pass the first verification and you will be given the money. In 30 days you will get a phone call from the bank and from the police; asking how you got a counterfeit check.

But I'm curious to know what online company pays that much legally?    Here is the thing:  just because the account number on the bottom of the check is a valid account, doesn't mean that the routing number is right, or that the account holder was the one who cut the check.  How do you know that the online company didnt' steal the account number?  It's very easy to print checks now.  You can buy check writting software anywhere.    I would go to the bank it's drawn on to cash it.  If you can't, have your bank put a hold on it till it clears.

MbzyriZ4aa	Use $2000 to fix the broken down car and then drive it.  Sell the Van... with any luck you will get enough to pay off  what you owe on it.  Use $3000 to put a real dent into your credit card debt.  Your debt to income ratio will immediately improve and you can see your credit score go up significantly within a month after you paid down the credit card debt.    Since you are already used to sending x-amount of dollars a month towards the credit cards... use the extra cash to pay down the medical bills. You will be able to pay your remaining debt of faster.    Rule 1 - Don't use the Credit Cards anymore until the remaining $1000 is paid off and after that... only use them to the max. amount of $100 a month and pay that off immediately when the bill comes.    House... Start putting it on the market... if you sell at the price you are asking for... great. That is when you can make plans for the 24K in equity that you think you will get out of it.  When and only when you have that money make plans with it.    Right now you have $5000 coming from tax returns... use that to get the second vehicle running and to pay down the credit card debt.    Good Luck|`|8xDOEr63aa	No contest.    Do option 1: scrap the damaged car and buy a $2000 beat up car with cash. You will be $15,000 in debt instead of $26,500 and you will be $230 extra every month to attack the remainder.    The sooner you get out of this hole the better.     Good luck. You're going to beat this!|`|AA11357056	I think you'd need to pay the medical bills first, but after that pay down whatever debt has the highest interest rate first. I'd be hesitant to putting $2,000 toward fixing the car... after all, if you can sell it for $500 that's almost a year's worth of payments on the van (which presumably is more reliable).|`|AYLRIMZJaa	First of all, you don't know for sure what your house is worth.  Even if you have a current appraisal, the actual value of the home is what someone is willing to pay for it.  And in this housing market, you will be lucky to sell it, let alone get what you want for it.  So that is something you need to consider.    And overall, paying off revolving debt ( credit cards ) is the most important thing you can do.  Paying interest is like throwing money away.  So that should be your main goal.

l1VZkkOSaa	ALL transactions are important to the accounting department of a firm.   If they miss one, or mis-enter one, the books are inaccurate.     Example, say a firm doesn't a enter a cash payment for office rent for a month (say rent is $ 800 month). The entry should have been:    Debit 'Rent Expense' $ 800  Credit 'Cash' $ 800    If the entry isn't made, assets are overstated by $ 800, and expenses are understated by $ 800 ( equals inaccurate books ).|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	A transaction is a "buy and sell".

rLifdl5paa	I do know about trucking. Right now I do not feel is the best time. There are a lot of drivers sitting for days with no freight to haul. They are not getting miles which is no money. I run a myspace with 2,800 members, most of them are drivers not getting miles.   Most companies are also not hiring new drivers or training them because it takes too much money to train a rookie. Also a lot of companies are closing the doors or filing for bankruptcy protection.   Schneider is one of the bigger carriers around, they are not training people right now.   Jevic Transportation closed their doors.    The economy sucks, trucking industry sucks right now and I do not recommend anyone get into it at this point until things pick back up. I hope this helps if not look me up on www.driversalike.ning.com or www.myspace.com/truckerstrike08    Read the comments on my myspace from the middle of March until April 2008 you will see.|`|taZlk9rIaa	It depends on you. If you are adventuresome over-the-road may be fun. Go with a big company and do not job hop no matter how tempting it may seem at least stay 3+ years per company. I have had 15 jobs in 3 years. In trucking, that is not unusual. The companies are hungry for drivers but it will seriously bite you in butt down the road. Because, they want you then they say youre not stable. But it was cool when they needed you. get what I mean. The good paying companies 1500+ per week require stability. I found out too late.    If you like staying home.    Trucking can be great but, most but not all companies want you to have 1 to 2 years over the road before they will consider you. but then you can work local and make 1000+ per week. And be home every night or every other night.    Car Haulers  Cryogenic Tankers  Gas & Diesel Tankers  Bulk Commodities    Are all local gigs that pay pretty darn good. I thought I was stealing the money when I got my first weekly check over 700.    HVAC I don't know enough about but the school is longer. Truck Driving school is three weeks and your off to the races C1 is a good trucking school they pre qualify you in a job. Prime Inc is also a good company even if you have no exp or lisc. - Good Luck

And, you will get a nice credit for her.|`|AA11284831	As long as she lived with you for more than half of the year and didn't provide more than half of her OWN support then you can claim her as a dependent under the Qualifying Child rule.  This will entitle you to claim the EIC. With $7k in earned income that will be worth about $2,389 to you.  Your income is so low that you won't owe any taxes (and wouldn't even if you didn't claim her) so you'll get a refund of all Federal income tax that was withheld from your pay.    This assumes that you yourself cannot be claimed as a dependent.
5e4e4f8356e4cba2471f757cb6786eb0aa	The Credit Guarantee Scheme in simple terms (it's the only way I understand it myself):    -Banks are scared of lending money to people because people are more likely to lose their jobs and stop paying back on loans/mortgages, and also house prices are going down (so if they repossess it, they might not get back the whole value of the loan because of negative equity).  -Because of this interest rates are high, and people can't afford to borrow money.  -So the government has told the banks that they will guarantee any loans they make. i.e. If someone defaults on their loan, and the bank don't manage to get the money back, the government will make up the shortfall.  -The banks are then supposed to not be scared of lending money, so they cut their interest rates, so people can afford to borrow money, so they do, economy is kick started, everyone can have a big party.    Whether it will work is another question!

A simple example:    you bought 2 stocks, Company A and Company B, each 100 shares at $10 for a total investment of $2,000.    Company A stock increased $2 a share while Company B decreased $2 a share.  Now your stocks are worth $1200 and $800 for $2,000.  But now you sell Company A for $1200 and reinvest it in Company C buying 120 shares at $10 ($1200).  So, you still have your $2000 invested.  Unluckily, you made a profit on Company A of $200 and you now owe capital gains taxes on $200.    Since you will be charged sort-term gains, the profit you made will be taxed at your normal income tax rate instead of teh lower rate of long-term gains.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	When you make stock trades, the proceeds are reported to their IRS on the 1099-B.  Therefore you must file Sch. D to report these sales and show your basis, your cost, of these stocks.  If you held the stocks 1 year or less then they would be considered short term and your gain on the sale will be taxed at your tax rate.  If they are held more than 1 year then they are taxed at a lower rate. If you have a loss totally on your stock sales then you can offset your other income by up to a $3000 loss in the tax year.      Below is a link for the instructions for Sch. D.  I hope this helped explain the process for what happens when you have stock sales.  An accountant will be able to help you through the process.      Laura H  H&R Block  Senior Tax Advisor 5   **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|l2ma3RYraa	Any good accountant should know what it is.    The 1099 is a profit loss statement, if you had profit you will need to pay taxes. If you had losses you will receive a tax break.    I trade the forex market and get a 1099 every year.
5dXsErAaaa	No losing your 1000 would be your max  Yes good point inspector my response was for the situation where you buy shares in a limited liabilty corporation only|`|lEX3CjWlaa	Actually you might be at risk. The way your question is wording it sounds as if your not  buying stock but becoming a part owner, i.e. a partnership. If that is so you could be liable for any wrongdoing the company does or for whatever reason it is litigated against and found guilty (e.g. polluting a waterway).    I'd be sure to check the fine print - with a lawyer if necessary.    Hope This Helps|`|bfa5e0b2aa86c9ae1c884c351880a0bdaa	possibly depending upon your ownership agreement and legal arrangement, if publicly traded no.

Currently Im a Full-time College student and part-time I work with this market research firm called Cashle. Market research gathers and analyzes information about the moving of good or services from producer to consumer. My task at Cashle simply  includes performing research questionnaires and polls and also referring new members to the company. When you refer users from UK, USA or CA you get 15% of what your first level referrals earn, 3% of second level and 2% of third level. Cashle has 5 different methods in which users can get paid. Users can get paid via E-gold , Paypal , Check which has $5 minimum, Amazon gift card  and Alertpay. Payments are processed on a daily basis. Cashle is a great way to earn some extra income. Must be at least 13 or older. To participate     Check it out at:  http://www.cashle.com/index.php?ref=payp...
ZC7kj1lmaa	Simply take the amount of money you want the mo to be for and either go to your nearest grocery store or post office and ask for the mo...it may cost you about a dollar or so.

UDxL7lPqaa	Why would a health insurer send you a 1099?  Have they paid you income?  And W-2s are for wages and salary.  I think you are confused.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	There is no federal requirement to have health insurance. Do you live in a state that requires it?
MPX0f5jzaa	That was an advance, not free money.  Of course they removed it this year from your refund!|`|AA10469473	No they didn't.  It doesn't affect your 2008 refund, which is whatever it would have been if there had been no stimulus package or checks.  The exception is if you didn't qualify last year, but qualify based on your 2008 return, you'd receive the stimulus payment added to your refund.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, many of the tax software designers took a short cut and calculated the stimulus into your refund for 2008 automatically, then have you subtract it back out if you got it last year.  This is causing massive confusion among people who think it's being subtracted from their refunds - it's only being subtracted if it shouldn't have been there in the first place this year since you already got it last year.|`|AA11556580	When you do your taxes, the software assumes you didn't get a stimulus check, so it adds it to your refund. Later on, it will ask how much you got and then will "deduct" it from the total. Thus making your refund look smaller but it isn't. It's the same as it would've been without the Recovery Rebate.  The IRS is just making sure you don't claim the same amount twice.|`|o7gckZ2Paa	My best friend had it happen to him too. I think it all deals with what income bracket you fall in or if you have kids.

Q5BM2POnaa	The bigger question is why?    Does he have bad credit?  If so, I suppose that's understandable.    Does the lease allow for the landlord to control who else lives there?  If so, your boyfriend is risking being kicked out.    Do you realize that this will make you 100% legally responsbile for the lease?  If your boyfriend is fairly new and/or prone to flakiness, that's a risk on your end.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	why should he be upset? he should be happy if you two dont work out he can leave and not be liable for paying any rent|`|RZzMse3Haa	He has no reason to get upset.  Make sure you have something in writing and signed by her stating that is OK that he lives there.  Otherwise she could go back on her word and legally evict you for an unauthorized tenant.  Verbal agreements do not stand up in court.|`|MhvwRwNKaa	does he have bad credit? that could be the reason|`|f9sL3WgQaa	No. He shouldn't. You may have the stronger credit or stronger sense of respsonbility than he does. Its a matter of what is best for the situation.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	he should definitely not be upset two young lovers should not sign a lease together anyway, things might sour at any moment.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	I think she is nervous that you will break up.

Like Peoples Court, and Judge Mathis... those things... 90% of the cases that are in there are people suing for rent due, and lease agreement problems. Get your boyfriend on it. If he is living there he is obligated to also care for the apartment and anything he ruins and breaks. God forbid you break up, you don't want to be stuck with the entire lease and the problems he created before he left. Just both get on so you are both not in trouble.|`|ab6c137a2865f6a61d2c2280e5b8959caa	In times like these, if a landlord is willing to do a month-month, she doesn't want either of you to get too comfortable.|`|a2DW1Bqgaa	Thats VERY strange. Usually they MUST have all occupants on lease, it protects them leaglly if you dont pay, then they can go to him. Very strange.|`|dVMfCdikaa	Why would she want that? I'd like to know if it ever happens to me. She might try and sue you for more money after, saying he caused her more money.|`|CCnej03qaa	Well, you should be more upset than your boyfriend should. If you are the only one on the lease, then if you guys break up or he loses his job or SOMETHING like that, which I am sure would be totally unplanned, then you are responsible for all of the payments, while he does not have to worry about it. Tell your landlord that you want him on there, I guess.  :)|`|x9TgRvkbaa	It's just an apartment, he shouldn't be upset, there must be a credit reason or something, don't worry about that, make him feel at home though, let him know it's both of you guys apartment. It's an easy fix, I wasn't on 2 out of 3 lease's with my boyfriend and I...so what?|`|ca6c1bac92d16664e751aef99dc02c33aa	you should be upset, not him.  it sounds to me like the landlord wants one "responsible party" in case things don't go well.  like you leave before the lease is up, don't pay the rent, damage something...and it sounds like they are banking on you.    your boyfriend, if not named in the lease, is not responsible for upholding the terms of the lease...only you would be.    these people do not care about his "status" in the relationship, they want to know their property will not be damaged, and the rent will be paid.  and who to come after if there is a problem.|`|yuAI037Iaa	You will be solely responsible for any damages he causes, but on the other hand if you were to split you could just make him move out because he has no rights to the house/apartment.|`|Pg7q2pe6aa	there is good point to this and bad point's.the good point is if things go wrong only you will get the bad credit report.the bad thing's are if at any time she wants you to leave like 9breaking the lease) all she has to do is say that you are the only one on the lease and you have him living there then you are in violation of the lease cause if you read the lease carefully it specifically states your name.now if at some time in the future you and him start fighting allot well then all she has to do is say that you are in violation of your lease ect... ect... so pretty much any time she wand's you out legally she has the right to serve you a thee day notice. really what you are doing is signing a one way lease and your opening the door for her to do anything that she wants and she will be covered by the lease but you on the other hand are in violation of the lease so good luck and i hope it helps

Pjm9pg7iaa	You do get benefit because anyone analyzing your credit sees that you have the loan in your name and the loan is not in default. That is a plus for you.    The one thing that is out of your control is whether a loan company takes the time to type in 2 names instead of 1 when they report to the credit reporting agencies. You don't know if you will be included or not.  You definitely get the bad part of co-signing if she doesn't pay..|`|AYLRIMZJaa	No, if you co-sign, the account reports on yours as well because you are legally obligated to that loan if she defaults.  But your credit will also suffer if she doesn't pay.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.

39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	Yes, you can if you are moving to start a new job or business and your moving expenses exceeded the $2500... BUT your claim will be reduced by the amount you were reimbursed. For example, if your expenses were $3000, you'd only be able to claim $500 for moving expenses.|`|Yaof4DNqaa	Yes you can claim any amount over $2,500.  But keep in mind you don't need receipts for all expenses.  For instance if you drove you can use the mileage and meal rates as posted by CRA at <br>  <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ncm-tx/rtrn/cmpltng/ddctns/lns248-260/255/rts-eng.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/...</a><br>  <br>  The $17 per meal per person per day may be much more than you actually spent for instance...so it may be better to claim this way depending on your situation.  Also mileage may be better than your gas costs...and easier to calculate.<br>  <br>  If you bought or sold a house those costs should be considered, if you had to pay to break a lease those costs should be considered.  Go to the CRA site and look around.  I like to see people use all that they are allowed too!

qBCGH52haa	In order to get a garnishment order, the creditors must first get a court judgment against you.  Prior to getting the judgment, you will be provided with notification of a court date.  Show up and argue against te judgment.    If the creditor gets the judgment, they then have to work with you to obtain satisfaction of the debt.  This usually means a payment plan or something similar.  If you then do not keep current with the new agreement, they can return to court and ask for a garnishment order.    In addition, unemployment benefits are usually not allowed to be garnished,    For more info, check here:    http://bankruptcy.lawyers.com/consumer-b...

2kIoVqsUaa	It depends on the software you are selling, market perception about that particular software, brand name, company history, etc... matters in selling a software .<br>  I was involved in software selling but different brand name. How do you approach prospects also matters.<br>  If'ts a prive/public company you have to tap it at 2 level. if you are reaching end-user first, provide some details on your company and try to get the department head details, his keenness towards trying other software, etc... then touch directly with the dept head then go down the hierarchy. if always talking with lower contacts or end-user, may not create any requirements. <br>  For end-user it's a software and they do not have much project pressure. Whereas dept head does having project pressure he understands that how new technologies helps improve productivity so that projects can be on-time and time to market.<br>  <br>  general sales of software would be, first identify the prospects and have alteast 30-40 numbers in a quarter, screen the company web site or otherway about their business, how much are they willing to computerise or it's already computerised, try to get the softwares they are using and contacts. if you build contacts thru your existing customers chances that you get good greetings from prospects. if you know their softwares being used, sit with your technical team to discuss how your company s/w is better and techno/commercial advantages. Your first visit to customer would be explore and not give any advice though you have complete info from your homework. later go-back with your tech team and make them understand the advantages of your software and it can help company. this is how we create a demand even if customer does not have requirement and try to change customer mind. then even if prospect does not have immediate requirement, they would keep this data in mind and would come back at some point as s/w maintenance or new s/w requirement comes-up for every 2-3 years based on the technological revolution.<br>  goal here is to create awareness about your brand, how your company willing to help improve productivity of the customer, etc... <br>  With all these exercise, out of 20 prospects, initially we can only succeed with less than 25%. As the brand name spreads widely, chances of closing on the higher percentage is possible. this is how sales people make huge money as it involves heavy runaround work, homeworks, etc...<br>  <br>  again, as previous answer said, it's your sales manager to guide you and make you success as his success also depends on your success.|`|ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	If you have had 4 jobs in 5 years in the same field and things have not worked out either you are doing something wrong or you may not be cut out for this type of sales. Software is not something that is replaced with great frequency but sales is still a matter of numbers. You make enough calls you must close some sales. Perhaps you need someone to work with you and critique your presentations. It might be that you have difficulty in either qualifying prospects or in closing. Most quotas are established using historical data and matching that to meet corporate objectives. You need to get with your sales manager and see if they can help you. That is part of his job. It is in his best interest to see that you are successful. There is a certain way to work a territory. Perhaps you are not working as efficiently as you should. Again, this is something that your sales manager could assist you.

TB12kOefaa	Talk to your Real Estate, firstly. And call a Real Estate Lawyer (or any Lawyer) and see what the say. I'm so sorry about what happened to you guys. I know a house is a huge investment and everyone wants nothing but the best. Especially in a time like this. Do some serious inquiry and try to get some compensation.    Good luck|`|ej9ijnS7aa	"my husband went to take a shower and it wouldn't drain, so we started to plunger it and dirt, sand and what looked like leaves came back out of the drains of both tubs, the realtor called a plumber he said we had roots in our pipes cleared them and left,"    You have a much larger problem than just roots if leaves came through, you have a broken sewer line somewhere in the yard.    You will get no where with the inspector if he says he flushed and ran some water in the sink.  It is not his job nor can he report on something he could not see.    Look at the disclosure, see if the plumbing is checked off with no problems, then call every single plumber in town until you find one who might have worked on the plumbing then you will have ammunition to take to court.  You need your own plumber to come in and tell you exactly what is wrong and how much to fix it.  At this point the Agent will start trying to back peddle too so do not use her plumber either.    I am so sorry you are having to go through this mess it might get very costly.    Added be a little crafty in how you question the plumbers in that you DO NOT accuse them of anything but just trying to find the plumber who did some work before so they can help you out again.|`|ab6c137a2865f6a61d2c2280e5b8959caa	Did the Seller disclose these problems on a property disclosure? Or was this an 'as is' sale?    The home inspector should have given you a full report, indicating the condition at that time. Tell him that since these problems were not indicated on his report to you, that you will report him to the appropriate licensing authority.  Because if he truly had flushed all the toilets, etc (all things indicated on the report), that if there had been any problems, you could have pointed them out to the Seller for action. That action would have included either lowering the price of the house, the Seller fixing the problems, or you walking away from the deal.    Everything has to have been provided in writing prior to closing.|`|Fk0EGJMSaa	Did you have an inspection done? We are selling and the inspector checked the plumbing for the buyers.    I would think you would have to prove they knew about the problem which I am not sure how you would do but a lawyer might give better advice.|`|r67YzIv5aa	Wow and Ouch.  Okay, you did an inspection.      First, do you have a copy of the Property Disclosure?  If so, see if they said anything about plumbing problems, if not and the plumber says it's ongoing, maybe they lied.  It is kind of hard to sue them if you've had an inspection and nothing was found, but get the information anyway.    Second, get yourself a NEW, independent plumber and have him write it up in a report.  He may be able to just snake the pipes, make sure he does the main pipe as well, if this fixes the problem, great.  Then call your inspector, hopefully he was licensed and bonded, tell him what's going on and what the plumber found.  If he is licensed and bonded he should have E&O (errors and ommissions) insurance and his "mistake" should be covered.  Even if snaking the pipes works, call the inspector, he may be liable for the bill.      Good Luck!!
wlO6zFHNaa	quick answer-    sales is selling a company's product.    marketing is promoting and advertising someones products.|`|KdYml46Paa	well given this is clearly a question off of some intro to marketing assignment I'll keep it brief.

0yqQg9CXaa	Sounds like you might have had something go to collection.  There is a little thing about fico scores.  Even if you pay off a collection, it will not increase your scores.  Fortunately, mortgage lenders do not focus on the scores.  They look at your reports in detail, and they will see that you paid off these accounts.  They will also consider your time at your employment and your salary.  Try to put 10 to 20% down if you can.  FHA requires less down - and they DO NOT look at scores.  /|`|cC568h4xaa	Try owner financing or a lease-option.  A desperate owner will not even ask for your credit score.  Good luck!|`|qArX5LYdaa	credit-report-free.totalh.com - try this service to boost you credit score before getting loan. After credit repair you can get the loan with minimal interest rate.|`|AA10072911	With a lower credit score you will have a harder time getting approved for a loan, and if you do get approved you will have a higher interest rate as a result.  If you haven't already I highly suggest going online to annualcreditreport.com and looking at a free copy of your credit report and make sure there are no inaccuracies on your report.  This is the only website setup by the government for free access to your credit report, and they do not require a credit card number to look at your report.  If you find errors, write to the credit bureau and dispute the inaccurate information so it can be removed and your credit score can be improved.  If you don't have any credit now try opening a secured credit card or secured loan at your local bank to build some positive credit history.
l1VZkkOSaa	It's been a few years since I worked at a big-name, but that sounds about right to me. The third-shift workers do get a tad more pay since they have to work such crappy hours, and hence, makes it hard to have a life.
aUQ1ridmaa	It's hard to give a perfect answer.....Some of it can depend on how much income you have from all sources, internet business and anywhere else.    For your self-employment taxes, you will need to set aside up to 15.3%.     For your federal income taxes you will need to set aside an amount based on your estimated tax bracket - anywhere from 10 to 35%.    For your state income taxes you will need to set aside up to 9.3%.    I have talked to self-employed persons who try to keep roughly 30-35% aside for taxes.     I would always recommend reviewing the situation throughout the year, to see how much money you are making and spending and see what is likely to be the taxable amount. So a monthly or quarterly review to "estimate" what your tax situation is looking like, and plan and adjust accordingly.    Shannon C.
kELOzS8Faa	You forgot that you didn't have enough money?    Gee, I think I'll bid on this....    Oh, I forgot I don't have any money...    How do you do that? It sounds more like you changed your mind and want out of the deal.    But yes, you are required to pay. and if you don't, the seller will report you and it will count against you in future transactions.|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Yes, that is the idea.  But sometimes, if you contact the seller, they will let you out of the transaction.  But they do not have to.  If you don't pay, they will report and unpaid item, and it will be a strike against your ebay account.  Too many of those and you will be suspended from ebay.|`|vVTmJjJDaa	Edit:  here's the info, directly from Ebay:    Buyers automatically enter into a legally binding contract to purchase the item from the seller if they win the online auction or use the Buy It Now feature. eBay's Unpaid Item policy requires buyers to pay the seller for the items that they commit to purchase.    Sellers can file an Unpaid Item dispute with eBay for each of their items that are purchased but not paid for. eBay will issue a strike on the account of the buyer who does not honor their obligation to pay (unless the buyer and seller mutually agree not to complete the transaction).    Note: If a buyer gets too many strikes in too short a time period, their account will be suspended indefinitely. In some cases, limits may be placed on the buyers account in advance of suspension.

0yqQg9CXaa	You will still be responsible.  These companies do not let up.  I have seen many time shares on sale at ebay, some for just $1 as long as you take over the fees.  Also there is a site called timeshares only.com that may sell your timeshare .  That company has a lot of complaints so google the name followed by the word complaint if you consider it.  They charge you a fee - and sometimes can't sell it.  /|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	It is called an "elusive default" in law. You can't get foreclosed because of an unpaid mortgage payment. But you can lose the deed if you don't pay the maintenance.  Or worse, they get a judgement in Small Claims Court for the unpaid fees. And that keeps you from getting a ZERO % interest rate on a new car..|`|19sa1ITfaa	no clue just answering for 2 points lol|`|CL9zXIA7aa	They will put a lien on your property. If you ever try to sell it you will have to pay them off first. If you just hold onto it they can take it away.|`|xjcZkmpbaa	It depends on the contract you signed and the governing documents of the property, but they can probably foreclose on your share, meaning you will lose it.  In addition, they can probably sue you personally for what's owed, and tack on late fees and attorney fees.  Giving it away would probably be a better option then just defaulting.
AA10033605	The web site does not have information on where they are located, or apparently give a telephone number. That is usually a warning.

lLm5uIuDaa	The problem with Direct Buy is their huge buy in fee.  If you aren't purchasing an entire home full of furniture or re-doing expensive areas like kitchens, it doesn't save you any money.  If you don't sign on when you go the first time, you won't have an option to do anything with them.  They are quite high pressure on this issue.  Their products aren't wholesale merely overstocks and high inventory buys.  You can get great deals at any furniture store in your area without having to pay high up front fees and do it when you need and can afford the furniture as opposed to be pushed into making large purchases right away.  I would steer clear of Direct Buy.

AA10072911	When you file a transaction on PayPal it removes it from the list of new transactions that have occurred on your account.  Filing a transaction doesn't delete it from your account or remove the funds that you received.  You can still withdraw the funds by having them electronically deposited into your account or request a check be mailed to you.  The only time you can not withdraw your funds is if the person who sent you the funds opens a dispute, in which case PayPal would put a hold on those funds until the dispute is resolved.

RqQDKEVHaa	I'm not a lawyer or an accountant, so treat this answer accordingly. However:<br>  <br>  You are not a "first time home buyer." The question is whether you had an ownership in a home during the past three years. Whether you paid interest or didn't pay interest doesn't matter. And whether you didn't gain anything on your first house doesn't matter. Plenty of people sell properties at a break-even or even a loss. The question is: Did you have an equitable interest in the property?<br>  <br>  The answer is yes. In order to sell the home in April 2008, you had to own it. You can't sell something you don't own, or don't have an equitable interest in.<br>  <br>  If you sold it, you owned it. Now, if the deed shows ownership went directly from the "previous owner" to the person you sold it to, then maybe...just maybe...it could be argued that you'd qualify as a first-time homebuyer. The question is because you still had an equitable interest in the property. (For instance, someone with an option on a property has an equitable interest in a property, even though they don't own it.)<br>  <br>  How does the IRS know? Possibly a lot of ways. If there was a recorded deed, they could know. If your relative who charged you no interest paid "imputed interest" on his return, they could know. And a number of other ways.<br>  <br>  To answer your specific question: Yes, the IRS can take back the $7,500 credit (which wasn't really a credit to begin with) if your accountant was wrong. The IRS will also charge you interest. And if they feel that you knew what you were doing, they could also assess a penalty.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	You can always lie and hope you don't get caught.

9FxR4khCaa	Have you discussed possible financial assistance? There may be either a hospital based assistance or if you meet eligibility requirements, medicaid. Short of that, see if you can negotiate a cash discounted rate-although that usually requires that you pay that amount in one or two payments. They usually will not give you a dscounted rate and a long term payment arrangement. If none of these are options that work for you or the hospital, they can and will send you to collection. What state you live in does not matter. I worked in a trauma center in CA for 25 years and they sent people to collection even if they were making monthly payments. The reason is they simply cannot hold the accounts for a long period of time due to many reasons.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Pay them what you can afford, then.

And, unfortunately, they do have the right to send you to collections if you can't pay the balance off within a reasonable time frame.<br>  <br>  Is the bill for emergency services, or did you plan to have these services?  What state are you in?|`|AA10671705	Although medical collections do have an effect on your credit scores, most lenders will over look them as they understand.  Work with the hospital and discuss your income and expenes.  You should be able to work out an agreeable payment amount. When you do, make sure you MAKE the payment each month.  <br>  Don't really worry about the collection if they do.  Worry more about them sueing you in small claims.  If they do, and win, they can garnish your paycheck for 25% of the gross.  Judgements are much worse on your credit than a collection.|`|VZRJZQxKaa	My buddy owes a hospital 6000 and told them that all he can afford to pay them is 50 dollars a month. Just talk to them and see if they will work with you.
Daq9gituaa	Take a close look at you records from the closing. I am sure you will find an amount in there reflecting a prorated amount for your property taxes for a specified time period. The amount shown can be used as a deduction for 2008 if you have enough deductions to exceed your standard deduction. Even if you do not have enough deductions to itemize, you may still be able to increase your standard deduction some what based on your paying property taxes thanks to a new allowance to the standard deduction that applies to 2008 tax year. If you are using form 1040, read the info for line 39C or if using 1040A, the info for line 23C. That info can be read in the instruction booklets for each form.|`|AA10469473	If there was any interest and real estate taxes in the closing costs, those could be deducted for 2008 if they were paid in 2008 and if your total itemized deductions for 2008 is larger than your standard deduction|`|zuGKIWfNaa	If you didn't pay any property taxes or interest in 2008, you can't deduct them on your 2008 taxes.<br>  <br>  Some of your closing costs may be deductible. I'll leave it to others more informed than I to tell you what they might be. (It's been a really long time since I've bought a house.)|`|AA10748271	Not sure if this is regional or not, but where I'm from, the property tax you pay is actually for the year prior.  Spring of 2008, I received my tax bill, which is payable in two installments -- June & Sept (I think).  The two payments I made this year were actually for 2007 property tax.  If that's the same for you, then any property tax payments made in 2008 would've been made by the previous owner and would've been for 2007 calendar year.  And it would be the previous owner as the payer who would be able to claim that deduction on their return.  <br>  <br>  To be 100% sure, check with a tax preparer or your real estate agent on the property tax setup in your area.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	If the date on your settlement statement (from when you closed the loan) says 2008 then you should be able to bring it in to your tax advisor.

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	Don't call..Write.  You NEVER want to talk to a collection agency over the phone.  When you do everything through writing you have a paper trail of what was said.    Now, since it has been over a year there is a good chance that it is not even with NCO anymore.  So the first thing you need to do is pull a copy of your credit report to see who currently lists this debt.    When you do decide to settle be sure that you have something in writing that says they agree to the terms given.  BEFORE you give them any money.  You didn't mention how old this debt is, but if it is an older debt when you send in your settlement offer you may be able to get them to accept 50% or less if you can come up with the amount in one or two payments.  The other thing you need to look at before you contact them is the Statute of Limitations and see if they even still have any legal rights to attempt to collect on the debt.

uRqlSq6caa	The problem with the Liberal view (socialism) is that it is an incentive for people who don't make much to stay there.  If you keep taxing the rich more and more what incentive do they have to make more money, they won't then who will keep up all the government programs that aren't working ie medicare, social security etc.    Who said life was fair?  There will always be poor people and rich people you shouldn't force people to give what they earned isn't that why we fought against communisim (socialism being a form of communism)?|`|u8QAAR8gaa	Nobody "makes money", unless they have a printing press.  Money is just transferred from some to others. Rich people have learned how to get more of it transferred to them.  Progressive taxation is a way to get some of this back to the others.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	They can afford it.  The poor can't.|`|deef86f1312d6aa410da26db3ce34134aa	We have a progressive tax rate system - not a flat tax system.  It is based upon the ability to pay more out of fairness.  Some people are poor through no fault of their own i.e. bad parents.  A few deadbeats should not penalize everybody.  By the way - dividends and capital gains earned by the rich are taxed at 15% now - even 1 million of income.  But a guy working at Walmart earning 50,000 is taxed at 25%.  Think about that.|`|fLqDrdFYaa	republicans are the ones who screwed this country thats why the rich pay more|`|IJIm1Dcsaa	First off you cannot make assumptions. I myself have earned my undergrad degree and have one Master's and working on a second. I work my butt off to support myself and my two children. I am not making enough to survive. Why should the rich who sometimes prey off of the poor be given tax breaks when they already have more than enough to survive. The poor need the extra help.|`|znr8SBiWaa	No, the poor DON'T have the same opportunities the rich do.  Not even close.    I went to a poor school.  The highest math class my high school offered was Algebra II.  Oh, yeah, I could get grants up the ***, but what college was going to take me from a high school that offered metal shop but not calculus?    When the poor truly DO have the same opportunities as the rich, then you can come back and talk about how they should have to pay the same taxes.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	Everyone in this country do not have the same advantages. If you may not know there are still elementry middle and high schools that dont have enough books for everyone in their class.   but besides that, people choose their paths, how they turn out is something completely different.  I know several people who are educated graduated from prinston and dont have a dime to their name, as well as I know people who make 8 dollars an hour and are able to save 2 to 3 thousand dollars a year.  why do the rich pay more taxes and the poor pay less, its all a matter of percentage.  Almost the same percentage is taken out of everyones check regardless of how much you make and that is fair and equal.  If you make 1300 then 130 should be taken out out of you check and if you only make 300 then 30 should be taken out.  it wouldnt be fair for a person making 300 dollar every two weeks to have 130 taken out of their pay because the higher paid boss has that much taken out.  You Political preference doesnt really matter because there are just as many Republicans who dont pay taxes as there are other political party members.  Its just a matter of who makes the more or less and who is honest enough to pay taxes.      Now my question is....is it fair to the ones who dont make as much but pay their taxes that the ones who make more DONT pay their taxes.     Where is this free education???  Scholarships and Grants are just given to anyone interested in going to school.  I have applied for several grants scholarships everything under the sun and what i recieved was enough to cover my BOOKS.  I worked hard in HS, I graduated with a 3.7 GPA but my parents werent rich and I couldnt afford the +18,000  a year tuition.  I clearly took advantage but it fell through.  So please point the rest of the US in the direction where free education is for everyone.. Unless your talking about the free education that is elementry middle and high school.      Yes the US is a very privliged country, but that is as a whole.  But certain cites are not as advantaged..  Do more research on that.|`|05whH2R2aa	wartz is right, you can affored it, and people lower-class like my family can't. They are trying to balance it out so everyone could have money.|`|10OcnWyEaa	well, i agree with you that some rich work hard and some poor are poor because they didnt work hard. But opporunities are not equal, and society is unforgiving to the poor. Its so commonly assumed that the poor are poor because they dont work hard. There are so many other biases to pull someone down from success no matter how hard they work. Racial bias exists still unfortunately, especially those who come to this country with nothing but hopes, and gain far less due to petty racism and bias....education is  privilege...its for those who can afford it. college isnt public like high school, how in the world can someone making minimum wage pay a minimum of 8,000 dollars a year for kids to go to college. you may argue that if the kid worked hard, scholarships could help....but then why is it fair that if the rich are not so intelligent, they can pay their way thru college, while a poor person has to be a supergenious....or else they just "didnt try hard enough"     thanks for this question...really enjoyed answering it....sorry for my socialist views=P i respect yours too=)|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	SO should your parents taxes be equal to those who make billions a year?? would you still be able to maintain an upper class lifestyle if your parents were paying the same taxes as those who made 3-4 times what they do??

atGPZz1Daa	The purpose of conducting the lifestyle poly is to determine if there is anything in your life that could be used as leverage against you.  For example, if you are highly embarrassed by the fact that you masturbate and would do *ANYTHING* to keep others from finding out, then this may be grounds for not passing.    Anything goes during the questioning and the direction is determined by your answers, both on whether they are truthful and on whether there is possibility of leverage.  So think hard about your life - is there anything in your past that you just could not stand getting out?  If so, then either admit it and move on or pass on the poly.    If you don't pass, you don't get the clearance.  If the clearance is required for your job, you don't get the job.

M2WniUdzaa	If you are a first time home owner, you are eligible to take the First Time Home Buyer Credit.  It is basically an interest free loan.  You are eligible for 10% of the cost of your home, up to $7500, if you purchased during 2008.  The loan has to be repayed over the next 15 years.  If you move before the loan is repaid, you will have to pay the balance.  Maximum payment on the loan will be $500/yr from your tax return.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	This is true.  If you have not owned a home in the 3 years before purchasing a home then you could qualify for a credit of up to $7500.  You have to purchase the home after April 8, 2008 and before July 1, 2009.  In fact if you buy it in 2009 before July you could file an amended return for 2008 and receive the credit sooner.    This is a credit that has to be recaptured, that is to say it has to be payed back.  Two years after you receive the credit you will pay back $500 a year for 15 years.  So it is like an interest free loan.    There are other limitations so I attached a link below to the IRS.

But, before you get too excited, you do have to pay the money back over the course of the next 15 years at the rate of $500 per year.  It will get added to your tax liability each year.    There are several other criteria as well:  you must not have owned a home within the last 3 years, you must have purchased the home after 4/8 /08 and before 7/1/09 and your income must be under a certain limit.
ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	You didn't mention whether your friend is in high school or college. When I was in high school and college I worked a full time job while going to school full time. It can be done. I suggest he find a job and go to school part time rather than going full time if that is what it takes for him to get along. If he doesn't have a place to live or money to support himself then he needs to concentrate on finding a job that pays enough for him to live. That should be his number one priority. It is not up to the government to support him. If he cannot afford to support himself then I don't see how he can relocate. There are things such as food stamps and welfare, but much of that goes to single women with children. It would be best that he have a job to go to if he plans on relocating. He may check with the state employment office to see if they can direct him. If he is under 18 then he may contact social services in his area and see if he can be put in foster care. That would at least take care of his basic needs and he could complete his high school education. If he is 18 or older then he needs to start with a job and save his money so that he can either relocate or at least get his own place. If he goes to college then there is financial assistance available through most colleges and universities. If nothing else he could probably find a job at a restaurant. There is usually a high turnover rate in that industry, especially in fast food.

BoAEgaAGaa	Since you are self employed you will have to file a Form 1040, along with a Sch. C and a Sch. SE.  On the Sch. C you will report your gross income and deduct any qualified expenses. The Sch. SE will determine the amount of self-employment tax which is your Social Security and Medicare taxes.  Also you will owe federal and state income tax on the profit on your Sch. C.      If you have not made any estimated payments you could still receive a refund if you qualify for certain credits due to your dependents if they are your children.  This will depend on their ages and if they live with you.  You should owe tax to the state of NY though on your profit on Sch. C.     This was a great question.

Those who are self employed fill out a 1040 Form (as opposed to the 1040EZ).    If you don't pay yourself through a payroll company (which would deduct taxes from each pay check) then you have no money for the IRS to refund (since taxes were never withheld from pay checks) and you will OWE money on any reported income.|`|MZJBcsQeaa	If you kept accurate records on your income. Also u need to make sure u have receipts on anything you might have used for your business. Your tax preparer would just set you up a self employed. but you need mileage, and others. too much to list. Also if you worked out of home then you can use percentage of that room or basement whatever it may be. just set an appointment with a tax preparer and bring all receipts, and documents that you kept for your business.|`|mtVMCkSHaa	It is possible. What you would need to do is have a record of your earnings and expenses from your business; like an earnings book, that tracks every thing you earned and everything you spent for the sole purpose of running your business. In the event you are audited, this will suffice as proof of your earnings to the IRS.    You will file form 1040 and attach a Schedule C, which is for self employment. If your net earnings was over $400, you will have to pay Self Employment tax, which is a social security and Medicare tax primarily for individuals who work for themselves. Use Schedule SE to figure net earnings from self-employment. The tax rate for self employment is 15.3%. There are ways you can deduct certain expenses and claim credits to increase your refund amount, you can look here for more info. http://www.irs.gov/publications/p334/ch1...
ODD7UZFuaa	its actuall H&R bank. Its a prepaid debit card. it has a mastercard logo so you can use it as credit as well.   You make a pin number the fist time you call to activate it. when you first get it the name on the card is going to say HR block client. You have the option to order a new card with your name on it, which is a good idea if you plan to use it as credit more than debit.   You have the advantages of having a bank card, you can call and get your balance or look online at your statements. another cool thing about the emerald card is that you dont have a max amount you can pull out at atm machines like other banks have $300. You can also get direct deposit on the emerald card so your paychecks automaticaly go on that card every payday.
9FxR4khCaa	Here is the guidelines for the definition of a serious illness as covered by FMLA:  A. A serious health condition is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider. The continuing treatment test for a serious health condition under the regulations may be met through (1) a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days plus treatment by a health care provider twice, or once with a continuing regimen of treatment, (2) any period of incapacity related to pregnancy or for prenatal care, (3) any period of incapacity or treatment for a chronic serious health condition, (4) a period of incapacity for permanent or long-term conditions for which treatment may not be effective, or (5) any period of incapacity to receive multiple treatments (including recovery from those treatments) for restorative surgery, or for a condition which would likely result in an incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days absent medical treatment.  The regulations specify that if an employee asserts a serious health condition under the requirement of a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, the employees first treatment visit (or only visit, if coupled with a regimen of continuing treatment) must take place within seven days of the first day of incapacity. Additionally, if an employee asserts that the condition involves treatment two or more times, the two visits to a health care provider must occur within 30 days of the first day of incapacity. Finally, the regulations define periodic visits for treatment of a chronic serious health condition as at least twice a year.    It would seem that he meets these requirements.     Here is a link that explains the FMLA:    http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/regs/complian...    He needs to make sure that he follows whatever requirement the employer has for meeting these requirements, including, periodic status reports (with treatment dates) from his providers of care.|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Ok, well first of all, he needs a letter from a doctor stating how long he will be gone.  It should be covered, but I think that FMLA is only valid for a few months.  He is probably going to need to go to rehab.    Also, they don't have to keep his exact position.  Just something similar with similar duties and pay.    I hope they keep it for him.  Good luck.|`|457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	Someone else covered the drug issue pretty well, but I wanted to add one more thing...    You also need to find out whether your brother's employer falls under FMLA at all.  Not all employers have to comply with the Family Medical Leave Act.    Here's the info from the Department of Labor:    "FMLA applies to all public agencies, all public and private elementary and secondary schools, and companies with 50 or more employees."    Also, for an individual employee to fall under FMLA:    "Employees are eligible for leave if they have worked for their employer at least 12 months, at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work at a location where the company employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles. Whether an employee has worked the minimum 1,250 hours of service is determined according to FLSA principles for determining compensable hours or work."    http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/benefits-le...        So, even if drug addiction qualifies under FMLA, your brother still might not be eligible if he works for a small employer, if he hasn't been on the job long enough, etc.    Just something else you'll want to be aware of, as you try to help your brother.    Good Luck.

WRnxDB42aa	The biggest downside is that there is so much competition online. The negatives can be greatly outweighed by the positives but you really have to set yourself apart from the other million businesses online. There are a few ways to do this:<br>  <br>  1) An eye-catching web page. This is the most important thing because you want people to be attracted to your business. It should suit whatever product you are selling but also be unique and fun. It should give the appearance of professionalism.<br>  <br>  2) Advertise on free press release sites. There are many out there to choose from but all of them achieve the same goal; name exposure. <br>  <br>  3) Get a toll free number. A catchy 1-800 number is something any business should have. There's a reason EVERY Fortune 500 company has one. A toll free gives customers easy access to contact you without paying long distance charges. It also adds to the appearance of professionalism. And a customer will remember the number and be more likely to find you later. It's a fact that a toll free number can increase business by as much as 600%. I recommend going with www.tollfreenumber.org. They cater to small businesses so they've got the lowest prices out there.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Join your local Chamber of Commerce.

Correct!<br>  <br>  What is the easiest way to find businesses that want websites???<br>  - Simple answer... Businesses that have websites, want websites!<br>  <br>  So, what you need to do is make yourself a list of all the businesses with websites in your local area.  Look at them, find ways you can improve them, and call and say: <br>  <br>  "I took a look at your website and I'm just calling to see if you would be open to looking at some different ideas on how you can attract more customers to your business with your website"<br>  <br>  Or some variation of the above.  In my experience it is easier to sell a redesign to someone that "knows" their website is bad vrs trying to  convince a new business that they need one.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, I feel like I am giving away my cash cow here but it is about karma right?  :)<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  David<br>  <br>  PageOne Website Design - <a href="http://www.pageonewd.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pageonewd.com</a>|`|CYCIlR7Eaa	Forget online advertising, contact your local newspaper and tell them to write an article about your new business offering local business your services with a discount if contacted with the article.<br>  <br>  Local papers love this community stuff and it's free.<br>  I've used this method.<br>  Then use other areas where relatives live to get in their papers.<br>  <br>  They even allow you to post your website address.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

DGFu03Q3aa	Dear My: Day care expense is calculated on form 2441. You can only claim day care for a dependent. Non custodial parents can not take the credit. See IRS Pub. 17 page 218    This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provide. Click on my profile to read more.   Errol Quinn  Enrolled Agent   Master Tax Advisor|`|KN3I89Ycaa	I don't think so.  I belive neither can claim it.  You didn't pay it and he doesn't have custody.  He would need to claim your son, though I'm not sure he can if your child is living with you.|`|0td65n04aa	According to the IRS site yes he could claim the child assuming he meets the requirements for a qualifying child under 13 and lives with both parents for equal parts of the year and you must maintain separate households for more than six months of the year.  The child care must also be provided so that he can work or search for work.    The link to the publication is below.|`|4VsUKjQGaa	No, only the custodial parent (the one he lives with more than half the year) can claim the credit for child and dependent care.      And you can only claim amounts that you paid, so normally you can't claim it either.  However, if the father considers it a GIFT to you, then you could claim it...and later GIVE the father any money it saved you.
ak3NBmINaa	It's a house so it is a private landlord, I assume.    You can negotiate anything, by making offers and countering the counter offers. Eventually you reach an agreement, craft a lease, and move forward. You want 13 months, your landlord counters with a 1-year lease that converts to month-to-month automatically. You say no, I prefer to have a 13-month term. And she says, "no problem, I'll change the end date." And there you have it!    So, before you sign the lease ask the landlord what the utilities usually run for the place. And ask what schools the kids go to. And ask what day the milkman comes. And ask if you can repaint the livingroom and wallpaper the bath, and clean the bloodstains off the kitchen carpet (just who puts carpet in their kitchen???).    Ask all that stuff before you sign!|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	Do you mean you are the tenant or the landlord? Generally a landlord requires a credit check and background check on potential tenants. Check prices for comparable units in your area on a site like apartments.com to get an idea of what the price should be. Most leases are a year but the landlord could choose to do a shorter or longer lease, or just do month-to-month. Many landlords charge a premium for a shorter lease. All leases should be written and should include who is responsible for maintenance & repairs, insurance, snow shoveling, etc. Usually landlords require security deposits to hold against damage the tenant does to the property above normal wear and tear.

Yaof4DNqaa	For this type of question I would suggest you see an accountant.  Or alternatively work it out on tax software like Quicktax.<br>  <br>  You've got to make sure you maximize everything else before considering the RRSP, and then you have to compare that to the interest rate on your line of credit and how quickly you feel you can pay that back.  <br>  <br>  If you were in a 50% tax bracket and you owed $1,000...then you would have to put $2.000 into RRSP to bring that down to zero.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you are actually better off paying off debt as you get closer to retirement.  If you are in a fairly low income situation you may be better off paying off your mortgage for example than investing in RRSP's as RRSP's may reduce your guaranteed income supplement etc. <br>  <br>  It's a complex thing - hence my suggestion for an accountant.  Some financial advisors might be good,,,but ususally they want to make the money by selling you RRSP's so they may not be entirely prepared to do the right thing for you.<br>  <br>  I think the deadline for RRSP's in Monday...so you need to be quick.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|x1EqOYoqaa	I would be happy to help you, if you would like to email me.<br>  <br>  jason.reynolds@investorsgroup.com

First, whatever paperwork that you filled out with your IRS   should have been handed off to the new management company. Second, any security deposits reside with the current owner and the management company should have access to it. Don't let them push you around. They owe you your deposit back. If things were not transferred over correctly that is their problem, they need to make you whole and take it up with the old management company.

You are not beholden to any lender until you apply for the loan, and even then you can back out before signing.    You can do the pre-qual with several brokers and be aware that each of them will check your credit, and each check lowers your FICO score by, what, one point?    I think a broker will behave better if they know YOU know what you are doing. They will always give you the worst deal first, and you have to knuckle them down--which should be easy these days, because everyone is HUNGRY!    That means spotless credit record.  20% downpayment.

For example if you live in TX your property taxes are going to be pretty high and may account for 2k of those costs. If you are doing an FHA loan the upfront mortgage insurance will be 1.5% of the loan amount which is the same everywhere you go.  Some other things that play a roll in the costs.  1) What is the loan amount?  2) What rate are getting?  3) How much is your home owners insurance?  4) Are you using seller concessions to cover your closing costs?|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Here's how the mortgage broker game works:    A mortgage broker obtains rate sheets from various lenders every day, listing what loan products are available, what the terms are (like how much down payment is required), and how much commission the broker gets for signing the client up for the loan (the lender pays this commission).    The amount of the commission varies on some factors: Generally, the higher the loan amount and the higher the interest rate, the higher the commission. And, the commission for two identical loans might vary from lender to lender.    Some brokers will try to get you into "a great interest rate" that is really just a so-so loan product. This particular product may require a large up front fee called discount points, where you pay a lot up front to literally buy down your interest rate a significant fraction of a percentage point.     Some mortgage brokers shop what they call "no cost" loans. This is where they get you into a loan product that requires no discount points, but that has a somewhat higher interest rate than the one you would buy down with the points. This would also be a product that offers a relatively high commission for the broker. So, they pay all of your closing costs up front (at no cost to you) and reimburse themselves for those costs from the broker commission.    Some less scrupulous mortgage brokers might try to get you into a loan product that costs you a lot up front - but with a great interest rate - because it gives the broker a high commission. That may be what's happening here.    Shop around with other mortgage brokers. They basically all get the same rate sheets. But, you may find one who has your best interest at heart as much as his own, and who will get you into the lowest cost, lowest interest loan, despite his not getting a huge commission. And, why would he do that? Because the mortgage game is largely word-of-mouth. He's banking on you being so pleased with your loan that you tell all your friends about what a great mortgage broker he is.|`|KN3I89Ycaa	7k is a big amount.  I would say shop around on your own.  Rates are around 5% right now which is a GREAT rate.  If you can find it there with no points, skip the broker and do it.  They may be able to find you a lower rate with someone obscure, but you will pay in fees what you might save.|`|H17L1WW4aa	Damn thats alot...   okay just go to your broker and say okay I know about YSP (yield spread premium) this is what the bank pays the brokers.  Most brokers will say they want 1.5% from the bank regardless of what they you pay them.  Say okay I want to see the rate sheets, they will say you cant and you tell them to go to hell.    Say the most I will pay you is 2 points 1 from the bank one from origination.  I refuse to  pay 1 penny more.  Have them put it in writing.  So then you can decide...  Should I pay 2 points upfront and get a 5.00 or should the bank pay 2 points and you have a 5.25% and you pay nothing other then title.    7000 is a joke unless you are talking about a 500K loan plus.  Find out your options.|`|FyPKXjEFaa	The broker shouldn't be charging you at all. In my experience, the broker gets paid by the lender in the form of a commission so it shouldn't cost you a thing. Maybe it's different where you live? I'd shop around for a better broker and find out what others do.     In my experience, the broker has access to more loans than you're likely to find yourself. It means they've done all the legwork for you, they know which ones are good, have relationships with the lenders and can explain any fees and charges to you. They should have a computer system where they can tell you which loans you apply for, what the rate is and what the repayments will be so you can compare different lenders.    But if you have to pay that much for a broker, I'd do the research myself.   This is the broker I used although they're Australian so may not be much good to you if you're elsewhere - http://www.smartline.com.au

You have to provide the bankruptcy attorney with current bank statement(s) for all bank accounts that bear your names!  They will tell you to spend the money in those accounts before the filing date comes up.    It doesn't matter whose money it is if it's in your account, the trustee for the bankruptcy can claim it to repay debts.  They aren't going to "believe" you when so many people tell them so many stories to try to hide their assets.    What did your attorney advise you to do?|`|AYLRIMZJaa	I don't think that the ask for bank statements.  Just pay stubs or W2's.  But if they do, I'm sure there is a way to prove that some are your moms deposits.|`|5Gxll9Hkaa	This will affect your bankruptcy but probably is not a deal breaker.    You DO need to tell your attorney about this arrangement with your mother depositing her money into the same account.  That will need to be reflected on your bankruptcy schedules and in the Statement of Financial Affairs.      There is a question in the Statement of Financial Affairs that asks whether you are holding any property for someone else, and you will need to answer YES to that (a question which is usually answered "no" in the vast majority of bankruptcies, so could easily be missed when your attorney or his/her staff is preparing your bankruptcy case).    You also may need to exempt the money that your mother deposits in your account, as it is cash on hand at the time of filing.    DO discuss this thoroughly with your bankruptcy attorney.  If your schedules were already filed and they do not accurately reflect this arrangement they can be amended.

If you both own it, you're both liable.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Likely, you're not going to find an insurance company willing to write two non-related named insureds on one policy, for that very reason.    If you have only ONE person as named insured, the insurance company doesn't have to pay for any vehicle they don't own - the other person's car.     You need two seperate policies, until you are married.|`|sj3Bq7vEaa	Legally, anyone can be held liable for any accident...provided that the injured party can prove it. That's my technical answer.    If you were to rear end someone, typically you're at-fault. However, if your fiancee is the owner, someone could try and argue that since she allowed you to "use" the vehicle, she is liable for negligent entrustment. It's hard to prove, as they would have to prove that she had a reasonable belief you would cause an accident (several DUIs, accidents, negligent/reckless history, etc).  The same goes if she were driving and you own the vehicle.     Once you're married, this possibly wouldn't even be allowed, since the vehicles would be community property, and it wouldn't matter who was the registered owner.    Hope this helps!

When you opened your Chase credit card the fine print states that Chase can make changes to any of the terms and conditions of the account as long as they notify you within 30 days of the change.  They are simply exercising their right to make a change to your APR.  They are probably raising the rates because the economy is really bad right now and so a lot of people are probably defaulting on their credit card accounts.  They need to raise the interest rates of other customers to make up the difference.

Normally they will make you pay anything under 2500 dollars.  But that really isnt your question.  The question is can you get clean title.  The lender is mostly worried about if there could be somebody in front of them.  If you get clean title I would say you could get a FHA loan.  I really dont think its a mortgage question I think its a title question.

Lease or no lease he can not install a camera in the living areas, only outside or in common hallways.    Your contract was a valid contract immediately upon signing, you need a court order to get out of it at this point.

How? Call her 5 times a day with questions about the apartment and demands that certain things get fixed before you move in. Like the carpet has a stain. Or a window doesn't lock.

ys2ukn1Haa	when i took a college diploma I was required to do 2 calculus courses.  If u are not good in math you should not consider accounting.  You might not use too much math in real life, but if u want to make good money in accounting you will need a lot of education (degree+designation and maybe even an MBA) and i don't think you can finish all that education if you are weak in math.  you will be wasting your time.  I don't know any college or universty that offers any math-free accounting program. Unless you are talking about those 6 month, 1 year certificates...but those won't do anything for you.  even 2 year certificates require 2 calculus. btw i also live in ontario.     Last year at my job they fired this guy because he was too slow in math, thus too slow to understand the concepts.  Even though computers do every thing for you, u still need to understand what's going on.  They say that with computer Garbage In, Garbage out.      However if accounting is your passion, there's still hope for you. u can learn math. Choose an easy college/university, chose night school (easier),  Get a tutor, never skip class, read the chapters before hand, do all the homework, sit in front,,,u can do it...good luck...|`|unlpwEDMaa	Accounting now is sooo easy.

If you just want an accounting bachelor's, it will depend on the college that you go to.  Some colleges will make you take calculus as part of a broad business focus that goes with accounting.  Others will be more practical (focusing on practice) and skip any extra math.  If you do not think that you can do advanced math, ask the individual programs about their requirements.|`|BGKWApGsaa	ok
QoVL5cDHaa	Students aren't exempt from tax. You get the same 6035 tax-free personal allowance as any other employee.  Is tax being deducted from your wages? If so, contact tax office, and ask what information is needed to put you on the right cumulative code number. I take it this is your first job since 6th April last? And when did you start being a student with part-time work? Situation may be different if you had a previous job in this tax year.|`|HKNbWjtOaa	no|`|oFiGyMWraa	To clarify some of the other answers, everyone is liable to pay tax if they earn enough. Even students.    In your circumstances you will not pay any tax because you don't earn enough. The current tax free allowance is 6035 per year. 250 per month is 3000 per year so you are well under the allowance.    You also have to consider NI contributions. You pay NI weekly on any earnings over 105 in that week. If your 250 is earned evenly over the month then there will be no NI to pay. But if you have a busy week and earn over 105 in that week then you will pay NI at 11% on the excess.|`|vVrY8yLEaa	It doesn't sound like you should be paying any tax. If you have a tax code, that can indicate how much you should be paying. E.g. tax code 5060 means that you can earn 5060 in a year before paying any tax.

fECovy3Laa	If you look into the diamond market, you'll find that diamonds aren't in short supply.  They are also not valuable per se.  their consumer value actually is as art.  Decoration on one's fingers or around ones neck.  Diamond miners sold the public on diamonds about the mid 1900's.  A large advertising pitch was made about "diamonds being forever".  They are pretty and they are hard.  By charging a high price, the diamond industry made them valuable by making them a statement of how much a man thought his bride was worth.    Read the article at the link below.  A quote from it:    "The answer to the problem was a new marketing campaign commissioned by De Beers that began in 1947. Perhaps you've heard the slogan "A Diamond is forever"? This was to mark the beginning of a change in the history of the engagement ring.     Subsequent campaigns would convince families to hold on to their diamonds as family heirlooms... and it worked! Used diamonds were not being released back into the industry which in turn created the demand that De Beers were seeking."|`|FEVQisMGaa	Synthetic diamonds = price drop.    EDIT:    Diamond prices are expected to drop because the tech market is expected to have a need for them in processors, etc.    It is why many have switched their assets from diamonds, to gold.    The future of the diamond industry is dependent on wether people want to maintain the value of "natural" diamonds as something exclusive from the "synthetic" diamond industry.    EDIT  2:    By force of logic, the conflict diamond issue should have increased the cost because of supply limitations, but you need to keep in mind the demand factor. Demand for them went down because of the moral component of having one, and the supply can be/was  met with the so-called synthetics.

Nevertheless, it depends what you mean 'estimate'  If you mean figure out for yourself what your refund wil be, sure, you can prepare a tax return using your best guess at your income and withholdings, then correct it once you get your W2s.    If you mean 'can I file without my W2?', the answer is no, and it would be a BAD idea to do so, since the inevitable corrections needed will just delay your refund.|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Wait for your W2's.

Particularly as the current arrangement allows him to violate your rights to privacy as a tenant, by entering frequently and without notice. Do you have a written lease or verbal? Just bring it up and see what he says.|`|kmK2tsD9aa	it would really depend on the agreement you both entered upon when you decided to rent out the room. You can kindly advise the landlord that you will be needing the space & if he/she says otherwise and you want to proceed taking it to court I would suggest you make sure that theres nothign in the contract stating that the landlord would be allowed to store items in your room. Also without prior notice the landlord wouldn't be allowed to enter your room.    http://www.nolo.com/article.cfm/objectId...|`|KPDOrmTsaa	You are renting a room, and the access to it should be only to you and those you invite in.  To me it is unreasonable for a landlord to expect you to not have the use of a closet in the room you rent.  I'd approach the subject with an open mind, but some firm resolve.  You should have access, he shouldn't.|`|bCcQBG23aa	It should say in your lease or contract. Otherwise I would say something about you wanting use of the closet and the privacy.|`|Qe5daE5paa	In most typical rental agreements, the closet is considered part of the room you rent.   But some Landlords can, and have, written their own rental agreements. When you sign it, it becomes legally binding, he's bound to provide you with certain things, in most agreements. Sometimes, when the landlord writes their own, they can make up their own rules.  Recently in my area there was a big dispute because a couple didn't read the entire agreement. They hung a painting in a room and was not allowed to remove it because the Landlord put something about hanging things up in the agreement.   Watch out for appliance, they can seize those, too, if it's in the agreement.    Read the agreement you signed and see if there is anything specific about the closet.    And I'm pretty sure the landlord isn't allowed to enter your room without your permission...

OpIhOtZEaa	I just started talking to them about services to get a loan modified.  I talked to one person who screened my case.  I'll talk to one of the compliance managers to learn more of their service.  It seems expensive $7500-$8500.  It takes long - 3 to 4 months.   I tried to call my mortgage company directly - they are swamped.  It seems like ULG's process exercises certain legal processes (like freezing you loan for 3 to 5 month to give you time, detail audit of loan docs to look for compliance...) to get leverage over the mortgage company.      It all seems extreme but it might be what it takes to be noticed by the mortgage company.     What has your experience been?     BTW, I don't know much about any of this.  I just started researching this week via google.

AA12399460	For the max honest refund, see a CPA, Enrolled Agent, or if you are in CA or Oregon-a licensed tax professional.  Another solid credential is an Accredited Tax Preparer (ATP) or Accredited Tax Adviser (ATA).|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	max refund does not always equal "know what they are doing".  Many taxpayers have hired crooked accountants for the max refund only to have the IRS come around and fine the hell out of them later on.  It depends on how complicated your return is.  I work for a CPA firm that charges about $500 - $2500 per return, with is overkill for most of the population.  Chances are Turbo Tax or H&R Block will be more than adequate.
AA11598210	~~No. Unbelievable as it seems, insurance companies are allowed to do this. I don't understand why they would raise your rates though, if you have an excellent report.    You can try explaining it as a temporary situation due to the horrible economy. Most companies are trying to work with customers affected (losing your job sure makes you a candidate).  So contact your agent.  Best of luck!~~|`|HmiFGACXaa	It is standard practice|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Nothing.   In all states except CA, the insurance commissioners allow credit scoring to be part of rating, because the corrolation between claims activity and credit score, is REAL.     Sorry.|`|pRibsCSXaa	It is what it is.  You get discounts based upon how good your credit is.  Credit scores are a proven predictor of the likelihood you'll have a claim.  If there wasn't data backing up this assumption, it would be illegal to use it for pricing.      Your credit report can't be both "excellent- but lost job and cant pay bills now".  It's one or the other.  If you're worried about making your bills, you may not be paying as much attention to the road as you would otherwise.

OoihsiN0aa	I charge 10$ an hour but thats for two kids at the ages of 4 and 9  but if it was only one kid i would still charge the same price. If you feel that the job is more difficult in certain cases charge a higher price but most people wont pay above like 10 and it also depends where youre babysitting like what kind of neighborhood.  8$ an hour is also a good starting price. Its also better to start high because they might try to haggle. And for two people babysitting kids? you guys will probably end up splitting the money one person would usually make. they wont double the amount unless theyre very generous
pfXLCKt9aa	It all depends on the population density in the area. Populous regions like San Diego, Los Angelos and Las Vegas generally use strippers which are independent contractors or part of a larger agency. The girls are paid off tips almost entirely, but also receive a portion based on what their contract stipulates. Often they pay the clubs back a percent of their lap dance charge, but have cunning ways to make the money back, such as taking their tops off and allowing more touching for more money under the table. Various clubs in California, especially the DeJaVu chains now have machines which the lap dance fee or special running at that time shows up on, then upon insertion of the money gives a green light, then a red light upon expiration.|`|lgSF2TH7aa	solely on their **** , i would think.....|`|viGqMW1Xaa	someone asked this question a few days ago. i think it was u|`|KN3I89Ycaa	It is tip only for for most places.

The way you present yourself does matter.  A $2,000 trashy dress is still trashy.  If you are going for a job interview then you should dress conservetively.  It dosen't matter if you're wear Ann Taylor or a knock off, but tight jeans are a no-no.    Personality I buy a smattering of expensive, quality items and mix then up with cheepies.  example:  Coach bag with payless shoes.  Channel suit with Kmart shirt.    Unless you're auditioning, it's the whole picture, not the sum of the parts.
1a73329e9b206ad5ece8b6d04e552014aa	Sealed transcripts are primarily for transferring to new schools or applying for graduate school. In my experience very few employers will care about the details of your academic history beyond your major and maybe, if this is your first job out of college, your grade point average.     Yes, it's true: All that stress you experienced in grade school about what went on your 'permanent record' was for nothing. (insert smiley emoticon here.)    Some may want to know that you took specific classes. For example, if you are applying for an IT job they will probably want you to know C++ and HTML programming languages. If they require proof, they will tell you up front with the other application requirements like how many personal or professional references to give. These are the only potential employers you should worry about providing a transcript to.
KhBmlaefaa	No it won't hurt. And if you are only an authorized user on your dad's it doesn't affect your credit.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	All applications (whether or not you get the card) hurt your credit for one year, but only slightly.    Having four cards is not too many.    However, having four cards with credit limits in the $1500-$7500 range may be too many.  Having a few cards with high limits is better than having many cards with low limits.|`|AA10072911	If you are listed as an authorized user on your dad's account then it does not count as your card.  You would have to be a joint cardholder in order for it to benefit your credit score.  As far as helping your credit is concerned you might want to consider opening a secured loan at our local bank.  Having both revolving and installment credit history will improve your credit score.

They also have a newsletter you   can subscribe to,  They  aim at the new investor and try to sell you nothing. Seriously, don't let the name fool you. It is not a joke.  Now to answer your question. No, you do not get cash if the stock goes up. You invest, but you don;t get a cent until and unless you sell.   If the stock is sold for more than the purchase price, you have a gain. if you sell for less, you have a loss.When you sell is when you get  the cash.    Enjoy!|`|yO5tm6e1aa	No - NEVER.    A company raises capital buy issuing stock.  This gives people a chance at part ownership in the company.  However, the companies do not give people cash for the stocks they own.  On a very rare occassion, companies will boost the stock values by buying back shares.  However, this type of buy back program is done through the stock market.  The company is not handing stock holders cash for their shares.  You get cash for your shares when you sell those shares.  Some preferred stocks pay dividends.  When a company makes a profit, they may choose to divide those profits across it's share holders.  In which case, you are paid CASH (via check) for profits made by the company based on the shares you own.  Again, this isn't a trade of cash for your shares.  It's your share of profits.  The only cash you get for your shares is when you sell them on the stock exchange to other stock holders like yourself.|`|bghPNGjMaa	NO, YOU ONLY GET CASH IF YOU SELL THEM.  SOME STOCKS WILL PAY YOU DIVIDENDS, BUT THAT IS NOT BASED UPON THE PRICE OF THE STOCK, USUALLY.    (Why are you yelling?)|`|bfa5e0b2aa86c9ae1c884c351880a0bdaa	No, the only cash you get from a stock investment is quarterly dividends if the company wants to pay a dividend.    The only other way you make money in stocks is to sell at a gain, a price higher than you paid.    spend some time in your local public library, specifically in the 331. section.|`|AA11639059	The company CAN (but not all do) pay dividends. Otherwise, if stocks go up and you want cash, you sell the stocks.     (Bear in mind, as last year was a perfect example, stocks can and often do go down too)

DAMZKbpDaa	You need to do a paper return and mail it into the IRS. It will slow down your refund by a few weeks.

Try to look up some websites to see if the demand will be increasing or decreasing in the next 5-10 years in your area.

The big superstars are fine, but the majority of designers are in the mid range (with upper middle class clients) and they are not doing too well right now. I don't see that changing much for the next several years.  So, it sorta depends on how successful you are at getting hired by a top notch firm or finding recession-proof clients.

RZzMse3Haa	You are typically responsible for replacing light bulbs in your rental while you live there.    That said, landlords do sometimes pay for specialty bulbs.  All you can do is ask them.  If they say you must buy them then that is final.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	When you do the initial walkthrough and notice that the lights don't work, you should bring this discrepancy up to the landlord and insist that they be operational at the landlord's expense (this is a safety issue - lights should work). After that, it may be up to you to replace burned out bulbs while you're living there. But, I wouldn't be surprised if the landlord would be willing to purchase the more expensive halogen bulbs that go into track lighting. If you got the wrong bulb or installed them wrong, you could damage the light fixture or something like that.    I rent out two condos and, when I fixed them up prior to renting them out, I made sure that every light fixture worked and had new bulbs. If they blow out while the tenant is still renting, I would expect that they would buy new light bulbs (although I did buy extras and left them in the garage for the new tenant).|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Once you are in and signed the lease, the light bulbs are yours to buy as they will be as you continue to live in the unit.  If in your walk through prior to renting you would have noticed the lights were out, you could have requested they replace them.  Now it's up to you.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	See what your lease says. You could also simply call the management company and ask them what you should do. Since they are expensive light bulbs you should also see if they are difficult to replace or if they just screw in like regular light bulbs. That can also give you an idea of whose responsibility it might be. But the lease should state one way or the other.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	You are. Landlords do not furnish light bulbs

ak3NBmINaa	YOUR real estate agent is not supposed to lie to you about that other offer. That would be misrepresentation.    Why not offer 345k, and release some contingencies that otherwise might apply. Like if the faucet drips. You could fix a LOT of faucets for 4k, and the seller certainly doesn't want to deal with repairs at this time.    In the USA, the two agents split the 6% sales commission. If you rely on the seller's agent, he or she has no incentive to save you one--what do you use in Australia? Pesos?--of whatever you use for currency. I recommend you retain an agent, or a lawyer.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Having a buyer's agent is not only commonplace in the US, not having one is a good way to get screwed over in the deal.    A real estate agent has access to information about the property - such as how much is owed on the property - and they have access to information about how much comparable properties are selling for. Armed with this information, the buyer's agent then contacts the seller's agent and asks specific questions about why the seller is selling, and may even ask how firm the seller is on a price or whether other offers have been received.    The buyer's agent can then advise the buyer about what would be a good price to offer and write up all the paperwork properly. Some times, a seller might not even look at an offer if it's not presented in the proper legal manner, especially when buying foreclosures from banks.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Your realtor has the best answer as only he/she knows the comps for the area and similar size condos.|`|PF2FBKBDaa	go lo, lie 100K, work good in china

bghPNGjMaa	There is no single answer to your question, each landlord can do whatever they feel is best.  Basically they want to know that you can afford to pay and are likely to pay your rent on time, and that you're not going to damage the place or otherwise cause them trouble.  So they ask for whatever they think will give them a clue about that.    You need to decide whether you want a lease or not.  That guarantees the rent won't change for some amount of time, but also (mostly) locks you into staying there for that length of time.    You generally need to decide if it is the kind of place you would be happy living in.  Condition, location, neighbors, etc.  Are the walls paper thin?  Also, is the landlord a reasonable person or company, if you can tell (ask some other tenants if you can).  Do they keep things up and respond quickly and effectively when things are broken?  You will also want to know what the rules are (can you have pets if you want them, etc.).  Have there been break-ins, car vandalism, or other crime problems (ask other tenants or check with the police department).  Are the doors, windows and locks secure?|`|AA11966821	1. Limit rent to one week's take-home pay.  Anything more stretches your budget to the breaking point in a hurry.  Landlords can require employment verification and require your income be at least triple the amount of the rent.  But at income-triple-the-rent, you're cutting things too close.  By the time you pay all your utilities, you can easily add $200-300/month to your housing costs, just for a 1BR apt!  2.  READ & understand your lease before you sign.  Make sure you have all building/complex rules in writing.  READ it, read it, read it.  80% of problems posted here could have been prevented if they'd read their bloody lease before they signed.  3.  Do a walk-through and inspect everything carefully.  Note cracks, missing tiles, holes in screens, gouges in the vinyl flooring, everything!  Write it down.  You and landlord sign it.  Then take photos of everything, and make sure they are time-dated.|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	If you get an apartment, definitely and absolutely do a thorough walkthrough and detail and damages or stains or anything at all that you notice BEFORE moving in.|`|JJhfc1araa	I've been a landlord in St. Louis for over 25 years.  I can't answer all your questions, would take hours!  Each owner follows their own criteria.   Individual private owners generally are more flexible.  Management companies usually have strict guidelines.  I want a tenant that obviously will pay their rent ON TIME  And be a GOOD tenant.   So rental history is important and previous landlords count big.  Since its your first, I would look at your income compared to your debt  Do you have car payment(s)? How much compared to income?  Do you have a lot of credit car debt for discretionary things?  Clothes, jewelry, gadgets. How much compared to income.  The 1/3 rule is just a guide line to me.  I've rented to people with 50% of their income is rent because they have minimal other debt. A car that is paid for or close to.  I've turned down people that qualify under the 1/3 rule because of a huge car payment and other debt that severely restricts their net income.  First timers are tough. I have a lot of college grad students.  Grad students are usually a good risk. They work hard and little time to party but don't have a rental history and their income is mute.  Then there is having a co-signor. Parent, grandparent, etc.  But they have to be financially able to pay if you don't  As a landlord, a first timer is a risk and I look more closely at you as a person. Will you be a good tenant? Will you and can you pay the rent and ON TIME!   As a first time renter are you going to be a pain?  Calling for every little thng or not calling at all causing bigger problems because you don't know better.   I hope that helps with some of your concerns  Good luck

If they did this they would then not have to worry about being understaffed. However, it depends on the employee. Logical people would agree to this. While people  with alot of opportunities would take their chances and quit. It also depends on the job. If it is a low paying job then the only thing an employer would be doing is making the person look for a job on their off time. Or get a part time job and work alot of hours every week.|`|22wKBmAyaa	This is more likely a small business question as corporations are very bureaucratic and, could not possibly alter existing protocol  to do something as pragmatic as you suggest.|`|bXl12I4Baa	is a very good idea but we all are greedy

Example, then every time you use your credit card put the amount in the book how much you used it for and at the end of the month when the bill come or the statement then check if they match and this way you will know how much money you have spended and how much is left.

Yes, you could feasibly claim exempt for 6 months and then switch it back but it is a crap shoot...if you don't withhold enough you will owe at the end of the year...you will get used to the huge pay checks and you will not want to switch it back.  Here is a link to a good reliable W-4 calculator.  I found that my husband could with hold up to 6 and we can still get money back at the end of the year as a result of our other deductions.  It gives us $300 more/month.    http://www.paycheckcity.com/W4/w4instruc...|`|6oC6k6hQaa	HECK NO!!!

To be so, you would have had to had no tax liability last year (for example made less than $8750 if you were a single non-dependent) and fully expect to this year.    I would call it bad info.

If you don't report all then IRS will send you a CP2000 for under reported income and file charge penalties for not filing an accurate tax return.    When  you file you are signing the tax return and acknowledging that you are reporting all income and you are filing a true and accurate tax return.    Never a good idea to cheat on your tax return, all is reported to IRS.  And if you cheat is will be costly to you.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	No.  If it was received in 2008, it goes on your 2008 tax return.|`|6oC6k6hQaa	Not if it was received during calendar year 2008|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	Income earned in 2008 must be reported in 2008.

DIVW5oDYaa	As a general rule of thumb, the employer should withhold 10 percent of your earnings.    If the employer did not withhold enough, then you would be obligated to pay the remaining balance.  Yeah, that would suck, especially if you already spent all your money.    Before you panic, do your return to see if indeed you will owe money to Uncle Sam.    To avoid a repeat scenario for next year, you can informally ask your employer to withhold more money from subsequent paychecks. Or make the request formally by submitting an IRS W-4 Form to your employer.    Student loan interest is a valid deduction. You'll find this on page one of the 1040 form under "Adjustment to Income."  You should receive a formal tax document that confirms how much you paid in interest last year.     The expense of birth control pill is deductible only if prescribed by a doctor.  This would be included in medical expenses on Schedule A which is permissible if you are itemizing your deductions.  Another requirement for medical deductions is that you can only deduct the amount that exceeds 7.5 percent of your Adjusted Gross Income.    Depending on the total of your itemized deductions, you may be better off going with the standard deduction instead. Use whichever is a larger number.    All of this information is based on my training as a certified volunteer tax preparer through the "Tax Counseling for the Elderly" program administered by AARP.    Good luck.|`|NXzwF8JPaa	Birth control pills prescribed by a doctor are deductible if you itemize deductions. But only the cost of medical expenses that is more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) is deductible.    Up to $2,500 of student loan interest may be deductible if your AGI is under $55,000. If your AGI is $70,000 or more, none of your interest is deductible. If your AGI is between $55,000 and $70,000, part of your interest is deductible. The loan had to be taken out exclusively to pay for education expenses. You can't be claimed as a dependent and deduct student loan interest. See the line 33 instructions on page 33 of the 1040 instructions at www.irs.gov.    The only way to figure out what should have been taken out of your paycheck is to figure what part of each paycheck is taxable (for example, if you contribute to a 401(k) plan, that contribution reduces your taxable wages) and get the withholding charts in IRS Publication 15. If you haven't done this before, ask someone for help.    You can get IRS instructions at www.irs.gov.
XYTUAzzgaa	you may need to look at your idea in a less subjective way. you first, have limited yourself right off the bat by picking something very specialized. look at the whole industry, not just one corner of it. workout programs come and go as people grow bored and want something new for motivation. i would say to go to school for some courses in business and study the market and what others have done that has worked. there are a lot of considerations here. do you have any education in health? what locations work and which ones don't? what types of advertising campaigns work and don't? how much will your business cost to operate, especially the insurance, since it is about pushing people physically? the list goes on. you may be able to get a loan for the business but that doesn't guarantee you it will succeed. knuckle down and do your homework first.    here's a bit of trivia for you; did you know that mcdonalds researches a particular location for five years before going with it? just one of the reasons they never fail.|`|fbk5IT6jaa	Interesting idea.

AA10220379	I recommend Scottrade.    They are the Best Quality Online Broker for the Price.    $7 Trades. No Fees.  Just $500 Minimum deposite into your Account to start.    You need a Bank Account (Checking or Savings) & a Broker.    You want to start Investing with just $50 ?!?  You can do that, but it aint worth Crap!!  A 10% return is only $5 with that!!     ? $5 ?     Mutual Funds are too Slow for me - Not enough Opportunity to make enough Money for the Investment. I want to see a Profit before my next Birthday!    I once had a CD with 6k, and I only made maybe $100 off it - Totally Piontless!!    I made my First Stock Purchase today, and I may just make more from it, than a CD in one year!!    If you want to realy Play with Numbers, and earn a Real Profit, then do some Reasurch on some good Stocks.    Just think of some good Companies you like. Check out their Stock Prices, and monitor them every now and then.    And Save your $50 - There is No Investment that makes you Any Profit worth your While, unless you consider making a few bucks a good Return.    There are Alot of Good Stocks that were Down at the End of Last Week. They may Fall back down to where they were, and you can Buy them Then!    Here is My first Investment Tip:    1) When everyone else is Selling, wait until those loosers are done, and BUY!!    When they are buying like Mad, wait a bit, then SELL!!    2) Don't buy Penny Stocks, unless you KNOW EXACTY what the Heck your Doing!!    Buy a Good Company you Like!! Psycology plays a Role in your Belief of what your Doing. Successful Investors are Confident in what they Do, and they Never let little things Stop them from getting to their Goals.    3) HAVE A GOAL IN MIND!!  You can't achieve something, unless you Know what it is you Want.  If you just want Money, you'll NEVER get it - You have to know Exactly what you want!

Here are three online discount brokers:    sharebuilder.com  zecco.com  sogotrade.com    I recommend sharebuilder. They let you do automated transactions for only $4 fee.     There's no minimum with sharebuilder.    If the stock rises, then the value of your investment rises, too. So the stock you paid $50 for might be worth $55 or $60 -- but only if you sell it.  If it falls, same thing.    You can set up a one-time payment or a recurring, monthly payment if you like.    Don't buy an individual stock -- buy a mutual fund instead. You'll be more diversified that way. T Rowe Price (www.troweprice.com) will let you start a mutual fund with only $50 per month if you schedule monthly payments.    Good luck!
rrp9c2tnaa	I would have to guess that forensics would not be a good fit because they have to do a lot with court hearings, legal depositions, etc.  If it were in a sort of "supportive role" just in the lab or something, then maybe.  But keep in mind that anyone involved in a forensic investigation is subject to being called to testify in court at any time.  If you could handle the stress of testifying, being grilled by the opposing lawyer, and rigorously defending your findings, then you may do okay.
TdDwY6o5aa	Why do you link bad credit and filing for bankruptcy with the five years of filing taxes?    What tax money are you afraid of "them" taking?    If you know you have to file the taxes, call the IRS and tell them what you are intending to do.

Also, get them to send you a record of your account for the last five years as well and written documentation of the acknowledgment that you have a problem.

The court is not going to look kindly on anyone as irresponsible as you have been.

And calling or checking too many times in one day or throughout the week will give you different dates or codes.  why jam up the phones lines so early, per IRS website it does state to wait until after the date you were to receive the refund, not before.  You should visit IRS website www.irs.gov and use the withholding calculator to change you withholding, so next year you won't be due a refund or owe, you will then just file the return and not worry about when your refund will arrive.|`|jaA4zCEIaa	if you e-filed your return you should also go to the web site and check your status there. thats what i did and my status hasnt changed but the IRS hotline and website keeps giving me different dates for d/d/.

udIrdSo0aa	You just need to relax. Breathe. Practice yoga and take a daily break from work to do exercises at or near your desk. If possible, put on a relaxation CD and stretch your muscles and you will release endorphins to stimulate your mind.    Taking a walk at lunch or during a break to get outside and clear your mind is a great daily practice if you can manage it. You will feel refreshed and will be increasing your health by staying fit with walking. Start a walking group at work if you can and keep yourself motivated with other people doing the same thing.     Also, how you behave at work reflects a lot on your professional image. Here's how to behave in a professional manner at work.    Step 1:   Be ready at all times. Being a professional is being on time and ready to work for the next client who comes in through the door.    Step 2:  Be discreet. If a client, co-worker or boss asks you to keep something confidential, it is very important for you to do so.    Step 3:  Be careful of what you say, and use clean language. Personal situations should stay at home, and politics or religion should never be discussed in the workplace.    Step 4:  Never speak badly about a client, co-worker or your boss. It is a matter of time--your comment will reach the person you spoke about.     Good luck!|`|t9zWziLlaa	Jobs-  http://lguille.info/

bghPNGjMaa	I would start with someone like Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, or some other reasonably low-priced place.  The most important thing is that you get started saving for your retirement -- you can always move it around later.  Just be sure you aren't paying a lot of fees.  In fact, you probably shouldn't have to pay any fees.    Usually in a retirement account you would not be investing in CDs unless you are pretty old, so no, there would be no FDIC.  Normally you would be investing in mutual funds.  So go with a company that has a wide assortment of good mutual funds to choose from.  Such as Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, E-Trade, etc.  Most companies will let you buy funds from any other company, although there may be a slight fee to do so, so the main choice is based on service, convenience, fees.    The big factor will be which specific mutual funds you pick to invest in, not which company actually holds your IRA.  How to pick the best mutual funds is a huge subject and probably not one that could be answered here.  Anyway, you'll get a lot of different opinions on that.
3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|N6puMZ7Uaa	Junpie: How are things in the southern hemisphere?

YovbCD9paa	Your 2008 stimulus pmt must be accounted for on the 2008 1040. If you rec'd $900 & that's what you're supposed to get, don't worry.  It was never part of your refund to begin with.  Most likely, you're good to go on what your refund is (@ least based on your question).    If the person who prepped your tax return didn't account for your stimulus pmt or put in the wrong amount, the IRS will likely check eveyone's return to verify the info is correct anyway.    This issue is coming up a lot this year.|`|AA11519827	Isn't it a little late to be asking this?|`|pt6wIlS1aa	You need to call and ask them, though it should explain in the letter they sent saying why they took the stimulus amount back.

They have talked about making it a true credit, where you don't have to pay it back, but as of right now it is really an interest free loan, not a credit.  Your credit score is irrevelant.  You just need to qualify as a first time home buyer and the house must be your personal residence (i.e. not a rental property).  You must close escrow by July 1, 2009, however there has been talk that they may extend the date through December 31, 2009.|`|0td65n04aa	You can resubmit your tax form by filing a 1040X an amended tax return if you qualify for the credit.  The rules for the first time credit are listed on the link below.  You would have to pay back the credit by showing 6 2/3% of it as an increase to your income next year.  They show examples that make it a little easier to understand.|`|AA10394990	You can file an amended 1040X to claim the credit. The credit is an interest free loan that must be paid in full in 15 years. That was not included in in Obama's stimulus package. The IRS is not concerned with you credit score, just the cost of the home. The maximum amount you can deduct is 7500.00, or 10% of the cost of the home, which ever is less.

coSRWGYsaa	Quote "I faithfully pay at least minimum on time on all my accounts."    The answer is in your question. Since you cannot/will not pay the full amount owed every month, the banks considers you a high risk borrower. The banks are taking a risk having to lend you. In this day and age when credit is scarce and credit card delinquencies rising,  banks have to raise their interest rates to make up for all the losses. If you pay in full every month like you should then you need not worry about the interest rates.
AA10378447	If they're going to pay it, it's usually to the loss payee. I would be shocked if you get around this, since all they have to do is do a title search at the DMV and find out that the bank had the title because it wasn't paid off. Then, that's called insurance fraud, for which you can go to jail. Do you want that?     Unfortunately, life isn't always the way it seems it should be. They're making you whole by paying the value of what you owe and not leaving you in the hole. You're on your own with finding a new mode of transportation. You can always sue the lady for more, if you want to, to fund the purchase of a new car.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Is there a point to this ridiculous posting?

They don't care what you want to do w/the money or what you owe on it. It's worth $6k, that's what they pay you.      That being said, you can use that money to;  a) Payoff the balance of your car  b) use the $ to fix your car and pay the remaining $2k to the bank  c) get a new car and new loan through your bank after you pay off your car loan  d) Pay off your car, get a loan for $4k to fix car and have lower payments    Lots of options, just talk to your bank. If you want to keep it, keep it. If you want a new car pay it off.     Sometimes they may not cut the check to you and your bank. They'll only cut the check to you and your bank if you tell them there's a loss payee on the car. So don't tell them and you can do whatever you want with the $.    Good luck.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	If the car is a total loss, by law, the insurance company must put a salvage title on that car, even if it's getting junked.  So until/unless you can turn that title over, you're NOT going to get that full amount.

dfb2419bdb22a3d3c381d69db6b27c9baa	A consolidation loan for $100K to $200K generally is secured by a person's home.  For your 2nd question, Home Equity loans are a little different from a line of credit.  The Home Equity loan is a lump sum loan.  For exampled if you applied and got approved for a $50K loan , they would give you the $50 all at once.  The line of credit is really designed for you to use when you need.  Generally you only be taken a few thousand at a time.  Since the risk is greater for a lender to lend out $50K all at once, that's why the rate is higher.

DCPWT4feaa	Yes.  Propaganda is any attempt to convey an idea that is largely accepted as a subjective position, or one side of a divisive opinion, by stating the position as if it were a given fact, and/or by using emotional cues designed to cause the observer to be attracted to or repulsed away from the position by an emotional reaction rather than by a logical evaluation of the position's inherent merits and weaknesses.    Abortion is obviously a hot-button topic, as is demonstrated by both the evenness of the division of opinion on the subject and the depth of extreme passion that some proponents of each side of the argument exhibit.    The drawing of the baby and the use of the phrase "save a life" is an attempt to associate the tenet of the pro-life position that every aborted fetus is a viable or complete human baby.  This obviously skirts the objection of the pro-choice movement that a fetus is not a human being from the moment of conception, which is implicit in the poster's argument.  To decide if it is propaganda or not, ask yourself, "would the poster campaign be as effective if the drawing were of a clump of a few fetal cells hours after conception?"  It is a reasonable assumption to say that it would not, so there is some manipulation of a clear-headed, even-handed position here.    This is simply an answer to your question, and not a representation for either side of this argument.  The Pro-Choice movement uses such propaganda as well.  On an objective level, however, the poster you describe clearly qualifies as propaganda.    And there's nothing wrong with that.  It's a free country, and both sides have a right to express their opinions as they see fit, so long as they liable no one, break no laws, and do not incite violence.|`|kFEx2Bx0aa	No you're not selling anything.

When two or more persons own land adjoining which is inclosed (sic) by one (1) fence, and it becomes necessary for the protection of the rights and interests of one (1) party that a partition fence be made between them, the other or others, when notified, must proceed to erect, or cause to be erected, one-half (1/2) of such partition fence; said fence to be erected on, or as near as practicable to, the line of said land. And if, after notice given in writing, either party fails to erect and complete, within six (6) months time thereafter, one-half (1/2) of such fence, the party giving the notice may proceed to erect the entire partition fence and collect by law one-half the costs of such fence from the other party, and he has a lien upon the land thus partitioned.    The statute at the beginning says that the two adjoining properties must be enclosed by one fence, so if your property and his property are not enclosed by one continuous fence to start off with then the rest of this statute would not seem to apply. If your two properties are enclosed by a single fence then you may be on the hook. However to be safe I would contact a lawyer who does free consultations and ask them.
ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	Copywriting is a very good career. If you work for an advertising agency and do a good job you can work your way up to Creative Director. Most Creative Directors come from the graphics or art side of the business or copywriting. Copywriters can be found primarily in advertising agencies, TV and radio stations. With experience you may find something in scriptwriting which could involve TV, video and film production. Most who come into copywriting do so with a degree in Journalism but some with an English degree.|`|wlO6zFHNaa	My Friend used to get $1000 a day for conceptual ad work, $750 a day for straight copywriting work for a rough 8 hour day, with a fast and proven track record and a strategic foundation.    If a company has an established brand voice, I'd err on the side of $50-65hr. Same for tech and straight writing. (The tone is pretty much established for tech writing.)

The amount of children may dictate the amount--this rate is for up to two kids-three or more add 1 dollar an hour per child.|`|9vYShoKgaa	depends on how many kids they will be babysitting. I get $7.00-$10.00 an hour. But that is by myself. If there is 2 people babysitting, you should charge about $3.50 for each babysitter per hour.

RZzMse3Haa	That does not give you legal grounds to break your lease.      All you can do about the neighbors is to report them to management. I'm sure allowing the dog to pee on the deck is a violation of their lease.    Your health issues do not give you any grounds either.  The ONLY way out of a lease without paying requires there to be something major wrong with the house NOT with you.    If you leave anyway, then you must pay whatever your lease states you will have to pay.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Write the management a letter (send it certified) about everything you have gone through and that they have not taken care of the problem neighbors. So, you will be terminating your lease and moving out. As long as you can document all you have gone through, you could make a case that the place is not livable.|`|yOmxDFJOaa	The neighbors are actually liable for the damages-I would pursue that avenue first.  Research your local laws about whether or not there is a certain noise radius that there has to be.  It is not the landlord's responsibility to change the behaviour of the other tenants unless it infringes on their rights.  It is, however, in their best interest to give the other tenants warning.|`|2lMP6ow1aa	When they play the music loudly, contact the police and report that your neighbors are being a disturbance. After so many calls, the apartment manager should kick them out if they continue to be a disturbance. I am in property management and can only suggest you continually contact your prop manager and/or the police. They will get enough of your calls and should enforce something to your neighbors. Good luck!|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	I agree with the other answers, it is not the responsibility for landlords to keep the peace between neighbors.  I highly doubt that trickles of dog urine have sent your health spiralling downward, you sound more like someone needing a reason to get out of a lease you are in because of other circumstances, imo.     Reguardless, you do need documentation.  You can always move out and wait to see if they actually pursue the remainder of the lease in court. You may get lucky if you leave the place clean and ready to be rented once you leave and no one will spend the time or money to pursue you in court.  If they do, you have documentation to warrant your termination and maybe the judge will side with you.|`|AA11966821	Actually, no, you do not have grounds to break the lease.  You are going about this the wrong way.  You would have spared yourself 6 months of grief to tackle this directly from the start.  First, confront the neighbors (politely). When the dog goes off at 5, march on upstairs and wake up the neighbors (you know you can set your clock by this dog, so be prepared).  Also insist that if their dog urinates all over your deck one more time, that they will have to clean and deodorize it or you will give them the bill for the cleaning.  Very polite but firm the first time.    Next, get the deck cleaned and give them the bill.  Tell them if they do not pay, you're taking them to court.  Call the police if the music is loud after 11 pm or the dog barks before 7 am.  Document everything (photos, log, details of calls to police, etc) to the landlord or manager.  Are there written rules?  With your documentation, copies of police reports, etc, then you can tell them "they go or I do."

Even on sale, they still make a killing charging $15 for a  T-Shirt made in China for maybe $1.50 - Hollister has some of the best marketing practices in the fashion biz.|`|HuL6bKNMaa	Well for one, they have many lower employees (the kids that walk around and fold things) and give them very few hours each week (maybe 3 hours a week). That way they don't have to offer benefits. They market their clothing well and offer stylish, trendy clothes and accessories that most teenagers find very appealing. Most people now see Hollister as style directly from the beaches of fabulous California and "have to have it." And because it's directed toward younger customers and Hollister has established itself as "the latest and greatest," people keep going back.

AA10072911	The PayPal Plus card is a credit card that PayPal offers it's members.  When you apply you will get assigned a credit limit to make purchases anywhere Mastercard is accepted.  You do have to be at least 18 to apply for the PayPal Plus card.    The PayPal debit card is a feature that PayPal offers it's members so they can quickly and easily access their PayPal funds and use them at a ATM machine or anywhere Mastercard is accepted.  Every time someone pays you money on PayPal you can use the debit card to access those funds.  As far as I know there is no age requirement for the PayPal debit card.

Next time there's no hot water, no heat in winter or other imminent danger, call the board of health immediately.  File a complaint, get the place inspected, etc.  With a proper report from the board of health which the landlord fails to rectify within their stipulated timeframe, you can terminate a lease legally and without any repercussions.

Enter the stock abbreviation of the company you're interested in the Get Quotes box near the top left of the page.  Yahoo is YHOO for example.  Click on the Get Quotes button.  When the stock information comes up, go down the column on the left to "Key Statistics" under the "COMPANY" heading.  Under Valuation Measures you'll see "Price/Book (mrq)".  At the time I answered this, Yahoo was at 1.36.    If you want to know what they do, go to the bottom of this same page where a link says:  Key Statistics Help.

A valuation ratio calculated by dividing the current market price by trailing 12-month (ttm) Total Revenues. Often used to value unprofitable companies."

YovbCD9paa	Your 2008 stimulus pmt must be accounted for on the 2008 1040. If you rec'd a stimulus pmt last year & it was correct, it was never part of your refund to begin with. Most likely, you're good to go on what your refund is.    If you didn't account for your stimulus pmt or put in the wrong amount on your return, the IRS will likely check eveyone's return to verify the info is correct anyway.    The stimulus check last year IS NOT taxable income, regardless of what other answers state.    This issue is coming up a lot this year.|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	the stimulus was kinda like a loan against this years refund...you just got some of the money early....|`|hc9PgibAaa	It does not count as income.  Turbo Tax when you first start out assumes you did not receive your stimulus payment.  So you start out with the money included in your tax refund (it is called a recovery rebate).  When you say to Turbo Tax that you did receive your payment it taxes the recovery rebate off your tax refund amount.  So you are not actually paying the rebate back or being taxed on the rebate.  It was just Turbo Tax's convoluted way of doing things.  All answers that imply you are being taxed on your stimulus or that imply you are paying your stimulus back are 100% wrong.    This question is thoroughly covered on Turbo Tax's question & answer page and in it's forums. :)|`|L9wHaNiBaa	I seriouly would call the IRS hotline but my guess would be that it was income and needs to be taxed.

Review the tax return filing instructions including the recovery rebate credit worksheet. You need to know the amount of the payment you received in 2008, which can be found on your Economic Stimulus Payment Notice (Notice 1378).     Two online tools on IRS.gov are available  the Recovery Rebate Credit Calculator will help taxpayers figure the amount they should claim on their 2008 tax return, and How Much Was My 2008 Stimulus Payment?

Read http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2008/04/list...|`|r67YzIv5aa	I was asking the same questions.  So I did a little research and found out that the 2008 Stimulus Check was an ADVANCE for a new credit on the 2008 forms.  If you received the check, you file and now you're paying it back.  If you didn't receive it and you get it this year, then next year when you file you'll be paying it back.      This is where it's confusing to people:    From the IRS Stimulus Payment Site:    Q. Is my stimulus payment taxable?    A. No. YOU WILL NOT OWE TAX ON YOUR PAYMENT when you file your 2008 federal income tax return. But you should keep a copy of the IRS letter you receive later this year listing the amount of your payment.    It's not taxable, you didn't pay taxes on it.  You just paid it back.  Then it gets better (also from the IRS Stimulus Payment Site):    Q. Will the payment I receive in 2008 reduce my 2008 refund or increase the amount I owe for 2008?    A. No, the stimulus payment will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2008 return.    If you were supposed to get $4100 back on your taxes this year but received a Stimulus check for $1800, you get $2300.  If there had been no stimulus, youd be receiving the same refund or paying the same tax bill you are right now.     Again, the stimulus was a new credit on the 2008 tax form that you received early.       Sucks, we know, but that's how it happens or so it seems.  Technically, it is not reducing the amount you would get back, you already got the money so they aren't giving it to you again.|`|qvVfIrhDaa	just guessing, but it sounds like it counts as income.  Kinda like lotto winnings.|`|tnWqWqv7aa	Yes it sounds like they use it as income. Even though the word Stimulus means gift.. they always find a way to make it mean something different.. Call the IRS.|`|EXcQEI5iaa	The above answer is the best, Turbo Tax screwed it up.

aHmAZeoqaa	With more experience, CAD management position.    The Architecture industry is leaning towards Building Information Modeling (Revit, 3D AutoCAD, ArchiCAD, etc.) and 3D modeling (3D Max, Form Z, Sketchup, etc.).  I've heard of BIM managers making 100k+, but I've never met one, nor have I ever seen a job posting that offers anything close to that much.  But the thing with CAD for Architecture is that architects normally have good command of their softwares.    Microstation too.
