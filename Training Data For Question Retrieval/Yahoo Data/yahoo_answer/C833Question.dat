20090130165919AAxO9hT	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Why are my parents mad at me? what did i do wrong?	Last night four of us were hanging out. Then one of my friends pulled out a bottle of vodka, she offered it to everyone but none of us drank any except for her. We figured that it was her choice if she wanted to drink, but it started to get out of hand after a while so we tried to take it away from her. She wouldnt stop drinking and after a while started to feel sick. we sat her down and she started to throw up, then she passed out and was still throwing up. We all panicked and didn't know what to do so we called her mom and told her what happened. her mom told us to call 911 we did and paramedics came and got her. the girls whose house we were at dad was home and he didnt do anything to help even though he knew what was going on, my parents knew that i was at my friends house all night and i was panicking so much that i never thought to call them adn tell them. when i got home in the morning i told them what happened the night before and now they seem mad, even though we did the right thing, how can they be mad at me for doing what i thought was right? we helped her all night and refused the alcohol. and got her to the hospital
