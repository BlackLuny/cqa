20090128183747AAZnxeb	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can you explain more clearly what this poem is saying?	True Love       True love. Is it normal    is it serious, is it practical?    What does the world get from two people    who exist in a world of their own?       Placed on the same pedestal for no good reason,    drawn randomly from millions but convinced    it had to happen this way - in reward for what?    For nothing.    The light descends from nowhere.    Why on these two and not on others?    Doesn't this outrage justice? Yes it does.    Doesn't it disrupt our painstakingly erected principles,    and cast the moral from the peak? Yes on both accounts.       Look at the happy couple.    Couldn't they at least try to hide it,    fake a little depression for their friends' sake?    Listen to them laughing - its an insult.    The language they use - deceptively clear.    And their little celebrations, rituals,    the elaborate mutual routines -    it's obviously a plot behind the human race's back!       It's hard even to guess how far things might go    if people start to follow their example.    What could religion and poetry count on?    What would be remembered? What renounced?    Who'd want to stay within bounds?       True love. Is it really necessary?    Tact and common sense tell us to pass over it in silence,    like a scandal in Life's highest circles.    Perfectly good children are born without its help.    It couldn't populate the planet in a million years,    it comes along so rarely.       Let the people who never find true love    keep saying that there's no such thing.       Their faith will make it easier for them to live and die.          Wislawa Szymborska                I kind of got that the poet believes in true love and she pities the people that have't found it?      Please tell me your opinion....

That you wouldn't do this to me,   You were my light,   My key.      I remember days of past.....   Remember how happy we were?   It all went by so fast,   What happened to you being my cure?      It's hard to sleep at night,   Hoping for a call,   Waiting for everything to be made right,   But then you left and I was the one to fall.      We had something no one esle did...   We had, what i thought was, true love,   But then you hid!   So now where's our white dove?      I wasn't playing games,   Were you?   Doesn't matter now, our love's up in flames,   Don't you think so too?      You hurt me, bad   Was that your intention?

20090128145703AAP6yzN	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How Does My Story Look?	Story- Follows main protagonists Berry Lewis, Daren Williams, Holly Appleby after graduating from the rank of Apprentice becoming a higher rank, Journeymen.  It’s generally a long process to become a certified Mercer (merchant) and once they become one, they may start a business and become masters of their trade.        They leave their master, and traveling together for protection, they must buy and sell certain rare items, obtain a certain profit, and report back to their master with evidence once they completed their task to gain a new one, but he also has business himself sometimes and with clues they must navigate his location. They make companions and enemies along the way.  They get vacations when they do a very satisfactory job.        However, it’s not as easy as it sounds.  Hardship arises both on sea from pirates and overland from thieves, criminals, etc.  And of course poor navigating at times, bad weather, lack of food, water, etc, war, being accused of being witch/wizards from superstitious towns people, dealing with consequences of making bad deals with leprechaun mafia, con artists, and even vengeful mermaids angered by pollution caused by humans.  But sometimes the struggle can lead to a very rewarding outcome in the end…or not.      1) Does my story sound too childish?  I’m 16, and don’t want it in that “Child Zone” or anything.  This story was in fact to relate to college kids.  Leaving home and trying to map out your future, taking a first step into adult world, meeting interesting people and being independent.  Since the era is somewhat a spoof of medieval times, I thought that I’d incorporate some medieval folklore and superstitions like mermaids, leprechauns, etc.  But not too much, I want a feel of reality also.  So there’s no super human strength and crap like that.      2) Does my story sound interesting?  Hopefully it doesn't sound like any cliché coming of age garbage.  My primary characters are no super heroes, have no prophecies, and don’t always do what’s right, but with time they learn from their mistakes, but sometimes not completely.      3) The thing which troubles me most is romance.  How am I to go about this?  I don’t want any adult situations between my characters, so since this is like the medieval era, I was going to make it the norm of society to wait for marriage rather than most college people now days to avoid adult situations.  Also they aren’t allowed to marry during Journeymen stage, but can date.  What do you think of this?      Also I was planning on Berry and Holly to have budding relationship over time, though not sure of the other's feelings, aren't sure how to act at times, which creates tension.  I want it to be really slow developing though because I’m planning a long series.  In what ways can I go about this?  Also does their description below sound compatible?      Berry Lewis- 17 year old.  He’s also black; different from your usual main protagonist.  He’s a laid back, open minded, amusing type of character and loyal to friends.  Doesn't rely solely on strength to get things done, as he isn't the strongest hot shot around. But he is a great leader.  Nickname is "Bear" And always wears a special mistletoe necklace around his neck.      Holly Schmit- 17.  Naturally, she is independent, possessive, compassionate, courageous, feisty, strong-willed, and a great fighter to boot- with only the occasional mood swing. Good ability to see the good in others

20090128200132AADvWIh	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is this poem good? Do you get the message? ?	Double-Edged Sword      You scream at me, proclaiming my guilt.   Why can’t I yell too?      You’re angry with me, cold shoulder ever present.   Why can’t I do it back?      You tell my secrets, sharing my shame.   Why can’t I tell yours?      You call me names, pointing out flaws.   Why can’t I treat you like that?      So many people have double standards.   A double-edged sword.   So why can’t I?

20090128150428AAaI0gO	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this?	The future is capricious to human prediction, leaving only the pursuit of pleasure as an absolute for self gratification. Not engaging in hedonism only leaves one as a means for another to gormandize for their own satisfaction. This is why nature makes everyone an egoist, as a means to sustain life. Egoism is the only absolute.

20090128145025AA3kjLo	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can you teach me about writing poems and is what I know about writing it...is the right way? Here's one....?	The story is like this:      I got interested in poetry last year because I thought that the language is far more beautiful than a story or a novel.   So I decided to make poems.   Then, I showed them to my ex-english teacher and she taught me to use rhymic couplets like the 1st rhyme with the 2nd and 3rd with the 4th..   After I start doing it, my poems sounds a lot better and everyone at school who have read it...they all love it.   All my poems are like 4 lines with rhymic couplets but the number of paragraphs differ with how long the story will be.      You see, it's like I'm writing stories in the form of poems.   The poem down there are one of the the poems I'm writing and all other poems use the same pattern but the number of paragraphs range from 4 to 16.   If you wanna criticize, please explain because it hurts a lot if it happens to something that comes from your heart.   Here is one of the short one ones:      Laughter’s Light      Laughing, once considered for fun,   Laughing, others thought it was a waste;   But a little cry become a joy,   When laughter meets the little boy.      A sickened elder in a hospital,   Down-hearted by the news of his family;   What more of the disease he has,   But the wish that shines makes him laugh.      A woman, rejected by her man,   Thought of nothing but to end her life;   Friends come and care,   Smile and laugh, everything is there.      What more laughter can give,   To relieve, to turn the heart;   Or to lighten a soul,   A miracle is what laughter is.
20090128150454AA3SxXY	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	This one... a poem, is it? Explanation required. PLease?	Okay, before you say anything...please let me explain first.   Down here is the kind of poems I usually wrote.      Last time, I asked about opinions on a poem similar to this one, I mean the style. I got two criticism and they never explain.   All I think after that is, all my poems suck and I've wasted my life on them. It really hurts because I've made many other poems too and I expressed my emotion in a number of them.   All of my friends love it.   So if you wanna say anything, please explain.      Friends Fries      Stop moping and stop frowning,   Stop crying and stop shouting;   We’re all here for you,   Alone you are no more.      See the light, see our smile,   Rise to reach our welcoming hands;   You’re not alone in this world,   Nor even in the other world.      That’s why we should run and reach,   Not to let the loneliness preach;   Let us run together and have fun,   In this life where fun starts and is never done.      In silent times, it never rhyme,   We sit and stay in distant place;   Where the fun starts to descend,   Who are we to pretend.         Sit below the skies,   In the night’s sparkles and shines;   Think about it all,   Should we separate and fall.      Let us rise and stand high,   We’ll fight for our right;   We’ll live with fun and smiles,   We’re friends, for all our lives.      Rain of tribulations come,   To rapidly rise and harm;   They are to bring us down,   But we should never frown.      Share our thoughts, share our laughs,   All problems are ours to solve;   Scars of life are not to be hidden,   For we’re true friends have nothing as burden.         See that light, see that ride,   Let’s have fun and raise its tide;   We’ll enjoy every moment we have,   With no worries to ever hide.      A day we’re success in life,   We’re friends, that’s truly right;   Thought we’re far and not together,   We’ll meet, smile and remember.

Okay here's a story I JUST barely Made up, tell me what you think of it okey dokey? :D kay :D and lemme know if ya want more and I'll add more :D         I rolled off the bed and hit my head on my dresser. That hurt like nothing else. I sat up and looked around. Why was everything so much lower? I walked over to the door, the door handle was way higher than usual.    Last thing I'd done was walked out into the road and... Well I don't remember anything after that. Now I was home and everything seemed so much larger than normal.   I walked closer to the door and tried to reach up to grab it, when I did so I saw... Paws! Not hands but PAWS! I got the door open after a long while of fumbling and ran out to the bathroom down the narrow hall.    The pasty white walls made me sick, like always, at least that was still the same. I jumped onto the counter and walked over to the sink and sat in it. Before I looked up I looked down to my... Paws. Ugh.   I looked up and saw my little puppy face looking back at me.   Is this why they say not to live alone? Because if you do, you have a dream of being a puppy and never become sane again?   What am I talking about, I've never been sane...   I walked into the kitchen and lay down on the counter. I put my head in my paws and whined. Well technically I was crying.      So lemme know if ya want more :D

20090225151535AA1R8lX	Arts & Humanities;History	Why are people so reactionary throughout history?	I will just use two recent examples. After 9/11, all sorts of measures were instituted- The Patriot Act, a massive Homeland Security Agency,etc. Some of them were knee jerk type stuff. Did they just do this stuff to give the illusion that they were doing something about the problem? Why didn't the government take action beforehand? They knew the threat of Al-Qaeda (in fact, I should say that some half hearted measures were taken beforehand- Clinton tried to bomb one of Bin Laden's camps and failed). The second example would be this economic mess. I am not saying I am a genius but I always used to think to myselfduring the boom that something was wrong. There is simply something very wrong when people's home prices increase much much faster than their incomes. My father and I used to talk about the insanity. We felt like the nation was living on borrowed time- especially because we knew that the U.S. hardly made anything (manufacturing) anymore, we were bogged down by financially costly overseas wars, our trade deficit was way out of wack, and the whole damn nation was in debt over their heads. We live in Florida so we experienced the insanity firsthand. There was just no way those home prices could keep rising and we knew the types of loans these banks were giving out too. Now the government is trying to act like they are doing something about the problem- but only after the whole damn economy crashed! Why wasn't there more regulation on Wall street in the first place. I have been reading Ralph Nader's articles and he has talked about this sort of thing for like... forever. He's a stand up guy though so he isn't the type to gloat and say, "I told ya so!" But I am. Just kidding! I am a polical and history graduate so I do follow these things closely though.

I live my life as an african american woman, but my light skin definitely separates me from being "pure african". I was told that my great grandfather was irish and german his before him from germany and I found that odd. My elders (grandparents) are deceased. Discovering this bit of my heritage has intrigued me, and perhaps I shouldn't be classified as one race therefore acknowledging only 1 heritage. I would like to know who my people were. I'm 26 years old, and I figured even though race is a BIG issue today, a bigger issue is economic and social status. So I'm not afraid of bigotry as my ancestors would have been. This is not the 1950, so I figured what could it hurt? Has anyone else tried to go down the list of their family tree? Does anyone here have any suggestions for me?   Thanks,   Nicole S

20090225150350AAwtnDj	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I'm ashamed of myself for this, but help?	My friend is on our school newspaper, and she knows that I write poetry. So she gives me these papers to fill out about me and my poetry and says that she's going to write an article about me. Sounds awesome, right? WRONG. My poetry is really dark and demented and stuff like that, and I don't think the newspaper would put it in. (I'm in junior high. Seventh grade.) And I have nothing happy at all. And I fell for one of those scams that put your poems in their book, even though they would put anything in it. And I told my friends about that. So she put in there how did it feel to get your poem in a book? So I completely have to make up something or else I'm going to look like an idiot! I don't know what to do! I can't write anything because I have huge writer's block right now. Help??? Please???????
20090128165624AASuJ3h	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Rosalie Hale (20 characters)...?	Okay, I know, I know, another Twilight question. I'm sorry people, they bug the hell out of me but I truly am curious and therefore have to ask this question. I'm not some obsessed Twilight fan. I like the book, but it has lots of flaws and annoying characters and could have been written ten thousand times better by someone else. Anyway, there will be spoilers so if you have not read Eclipse do not read this question.                                 *****   Was Rosalie supposed to have been raped by Roy and his friends? Because that's the impression I got but when I was talking about it with this girl she looked at me like I was crazy and perverted. She said that she had thought that they just beat her. But I thought that they had raped and beaten her....So, what do you think? Was she raped? Or just attacked?

I certainly do read alot more than I watch tv.    Anyway this is just a little poll to see what the people on yahoo answers prefer. So what do you prefer Books or Television?

I need a name for this world. this is how the the story starts out.      I have always had a huge imagination. I was very good when I was younger coming up with ways to play and make up magical stories. I was an only child I’d guess that’s why I had this over powering imagination! I love to take long walks into anywhere and just write. Sometimes Id get so caught up in my imagination id forget where I was even as school and my friend Sam would have to snap me back into reality always saying "Tesla your so weird."   I loved it when I got to go to my grandparents cause they live out in the middle of nowhere in the wood so it was perfect to get to write and escape to my own world…    When I heard my parents arguing it usually upset me but I always got to go down to grand parents house so today it did nothing but excite me since I just haven’t had the time or place to get to escape to my own world.    When I got to my grandparents house I went in gave them hugs and visited after grandma Rose got started with dinner and grandpa Jasper with his tv shows I took the chance an grabbed my pin and paper and headed out to the woods. Grandma asked me to not go past there fence cause the other side was not there property but she had told me no one had lived there for many years. I was sitting on a rock and just realized I needed something different a little adventure I mean what could it hurt walking past the fence no one lived there so no one would ever know right!            Well she ends up in a whole new world very magical i dont want to go much more into it but i was just wondering a of a good magical name for the now World she is in.

Hi,      I am yet to buy the Artemis Fowl series by Eoin Colfer which looks interesting, but I recently bought his other book, Half Moon Investigations, and well, it's not really my cup of tea. The jokes are laughable and smart, but I think the book is most likely meant for kids. Yeah, I know, I took the book at the 8-12 year-old section (I am 15 going on 16) but I thought the book's going to be ok,      Well, I hope you can help me if the Artemis Fowl series is suitable for me or not, because I want to make it worth my money since I buy books using my own monthly allowance, which is not really plenty, I might add [except school books].      I want to make sure if it's worth the money to be committed to this series.

20090128162828AAR73Vw	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	After a hiatus from Y!A usage...I just have to say...?	I loved Twilight and used to spend a lot of time here in the Books/Authors section a few months ago. I took a break from Y!A because I just didn't have time anymore, and I'm so annoyed that months later, Twilight is still being OBSESSED over in this section. I thought that when I was on Y!A a few months ago it was all of the hype from the movie and the book release..but no, it's sadly always like this.    So this isn't a question - just a shoutout to all of those who used to say "STOP TALKING ABOUT TWILIGHT". I finally, finally agree with you.

Its an action/romance/fantasy with a little bit of comedy.      When (I havent thought of a name yet) Turns into a werewolf, she runs off into the forest where she finds a meadow. Determined never to go back home, she is amazed to come across something amazing. A vampire. Mysterious yet alluring, the vampire is deadly but tries not to kill her and stay away from her, which is difficult because she won't leave. She is going to die one way or another; in the forest, she will get killed by him, and out, the deadly Searchers will surely find out.       Along the way, she develops an unbreakable relationship with the vampire until her friend attacks the vampires friend. Never to be seen with him again, she is lost and alone. She can not find the meadow again....      Now, when she wants to go back, will she be able to? Will her heart ever belong to someone else? Will she ever find the meadow again?         So what do you think? And also if you could give me name recommendations that would be awesome.      If you dont like it, recommendations for things I could change would be great, and any questions welcome of course.      If you think I should swap the vampire with a "moster I invented called a Vehiymith, let me know aswell.      PLEASE ANSWER thank you xo

Spring’s anxious phalanx marches forth His nemesis to vanquish, and though his foe raise the ensign of pax afore the battle’s din, He’ll requite but with the fist of pox for this Old Man Winter’s sins.       By Winter’s icy blast his foes were wore out, chained and fetered, in frozen graves they mone beneith; buried without mercy under “Scythian Feathers” (2).       Now see Him Spring to arms alas as the bright and morning star.      But Old Man Winter as the House of Usher doth wind down as the clock, the time of Spring hath come about and from sweet season’s lavish house, Winter is ushered out”.

20090128191521AATxdpi	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can someone tell me what you think about this poem?	What do you think bout this poem? What do you think it;s about?         How do you go on living?   When you realize that all you've done was a waste   When you realize that your whole life has been all lies   People lying to you to protect you   People lying because they knew you'd be hurt.    When you realize that you have nowhere left to run   No one left to tell you to hold on   To tell you it's okay and it's going to be okay.    No one left to hold when you need to cry.   When you realize that your alone in the world.   No one thinks about you.   No one wonders if your okay.   No one listens for the phone to ring to hear your voice.   There's no place to hide. There's no place to run.    All is grown dark. The Pain unbearable.    No one's left to stop what everyone knows is going to happen.   Why??   Because I wanted it this way?   Well at first yes.   Now, No I don't want to be alone anymore.   I need someone to hold. I need someone to cry on,   Someone to make everything okay just by one look.    How do you go on living when living is hell and there's no way out?

20090128185535AA1OA6k	Arts & Humanities;History	Who was the Latin American wealthy man obsessed with sinning? Committed torture and murder...?	I remember reading about a powerful man in Latin America that was either a drug lord or warlord, that was obsessed with committing acts and rituals of a sadistic and sinful nature, that it supposedly was going to grant him a ruling seat in Hell or something.  I think it was mentioned that he would do things such as take baths in blood.  It was something done in the mid to late 1900s i believe.      I have to do a project for my Latin American History class, and remembered this, and would love to do a paper on something really interesting like this.      I'm pretty sure this was NOT Pablo Escobar, and it was NOT from a movie.  This really happened.

Human beings start out with a sperm cell and an egg cell... the baby begins at one cell and gets larger and larger based upon the nourishment it receives from its mother. its mother receives nourishment from food which grows on earth. can it be assumed that the food goes into the mother, breaks down into its bare chemical structure, is placed into the single cell until that cell doubles then the two cells are pumped full of the chemically broken down food and this process continues until a baby exists... does that mean it is safe to say that our bodies are composed mostly of earth/food we have ingested??? matter can not be created or destroyed... we're all made of matter... at one point there was no animal life on earth... does that mean that all animal life came from the matter of the earth and the plants on it???

20090128200242AA4zkAp	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Can there be such a thing as a good slave master?	many see it as such:      if you were a slave master, you are totally evil since you are partaking in an evil institution. even if you, as a slave master, give your slaves the maximum freedom that you are allowed to, you will still be just as evil as the man that brutally beats his slaves everyday for no reason.      so given that, can there be such a thing as a good slave master? if not, is there something fallacious about the above line of thinking that inhibits there being one or is it just not possible?

20090128195235AAoJ1OP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	My other book idea - thoughts?	I've posted about the book idea I'm most drawn to write at the moment, ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylc=...  but I also have another idea that I might get back to again.      I'd appreciate your thoughts on it and whether it is something you would be interested to read.      Be aware it is a Young Adult book but I'd also like it to appeal to a wider (i.e. older) audience too.      Please be aware that the beginning of the story sounds soooo cliche teen-horror, I know. But if you stick with it, you'll see where the story twists and introduces the main idea - love.      Setting - high school    Kate (18yrs)  feels she just fits into the background at school. Not cool, not geeky - inoffensive.      She stumbles across something at school (not sure what this something is yet!) she doesn't realise implicates someone in a lot of mess. That someone (a teacher) realises she knows his secret (even though Kate isn't aware of its significance) and plans to kill her.   Kate is meant to be in detention at 3pm with the teacher behind the killing plot, but instead at the last minute takes herself to the school tower which is out of bounds but is a haven for her. She hears someone else coming into the tower and not wanting to be caught, she leaves and slowly heads to her detention.   Meanwhile, another girl is in Kate's place and time where she is meant to be killed.   The teacher's intent to kill Kate is so strong, it has a life of it's own. Because Kate is in the tower when the intent is "let loose", she is protected by the school spirit (this is based on a legend at my own real life high school about a ghost in the tower that was out of bounds!).   The intent then richochets until it finds the next target closest to the teacher who let loose the intent.   (are you still with me?)   The teacher had an altercation with another girl that flared him up enough that the intent for Kate, turns and attacks this girl instead.   Kate walks into the detention room late, just in time to see the other girl (Whitney) get killed (something suitably gory for a teen audience) in the place she was meant to be in.   Chaos ensues and Kate is caught up in the investigation into how the accident happened. To everyone, including Kate, it looks like an accident.   INTRO LOVE BIT   Investigating the accident is 20y.o. Paul who is the older brother of one of Kate's classmates.   Kate even in her distress at the situation starts to fall for Paul because he is so kind to her when questioning her. And of course he is drop dead gorgeous - er duh.   Kate is shaky but ok and after a long day goes home to sleep and try to forget the day.   This is where the spirit intervenes and a time loop is created to help protect the students.   Kate wakes up to the exact same day as the one she just finished. Everything is exactly the same. When she gets to school, Whitney is still alive and as obnoxious as ever. Kate figures it must be a dream and goes through the day with a headache from the de ja vous. The headache prevents her from going into the room where she stumbled on the damning evidence that implicates the teacher is something bad (any ideas what this could be?) as she did the previous day and instead heads to the sick bay to get some painkillers. The day continues the same and at 3pm she heads to her detention as with the day before, but suddenly remembers what happened in her dream and runs to the classroom rather than dawdles.    She gets there in time to save Whitney from the accident. Whitney is a bit cut up but otherwise fine.    Next day the loop continues but when Kate gets to school, everything is the same except Whitney who looks shocked and keeps looking at her hands which were cut the day before. Kate realises that Whitney is in the loop with her while everyone else continues the same day again, unawares.   The girls band together during the day comforting each other in the scary situation.   At the same time of day as Whitney's accident, another girl Grace is killed with Kate and Whitney as witnesses to the freak accident.   Paul comes in again to interview Kate and she tells him what is happening. Paul doesn't believe her but realises she is very upset and he spends the rest of the afternoon with her trying to calm her down.      Next day loops again and Kate realises that Paul will not have remembered anything she told him. Grace is fine but Kate and Whitney realise that they will need to save Grace at 3pm - which they do.   Next day loops again but this time Grace is with Kate and Whitney in the loop and the girls start to try and figure out what is happening and how they can stop it.   Kate realises the only time she gets with Paul are when the accidents happen.      Story continues with more people being drawn into the loop and Kate building her relationship with Paul even though he forgets her at the end of each day. Kate uses this advantage to speed up the relationship though by u

20090128203111AAu3Hxu	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Starter Photography Career year 1 FOR REAL NO BS?	hello.  I am looking to get into photography.  I have a few questions.  i would like to know where to start first.  Do i take classes?  read books and do it on my own?  if so what are some good books to get and read.  I live in Florida and there is a lot of beauty here, with the sky, people scenary and so on here in florida.        Whats the best way to pursue in a career in photography.  I hear everything about the Cannon Rebel DSLR and the NIKON d40 d60 cameras.  I want to get a camera, that is not going to limit me in the next 2 or 3 years.  I want a camera, that will be compatible with multiple types of lenses and not hold me back when i get more familiar with the camera i choose.  I will eventually upgrade to a better camera once I learn all the features and know what's on the camera.  But i dont want to be held back because something on the camera i wasnt aware of at first.  Hope to get some help here.  I did as much reading as a could but peoples posts are very vague or uncertain questioning.  All in all, I know this is what I want to do.  Im looking to spend anywhere from 200 to 800$ on a camera.  Then after i get my protfolio started, i will look into lenses.  I want this bad.  And will do my best to get there.  I really would love to do action shooting, like football basetball baseball games and such things like that.  Also shooting art, museums, scenary's, modeling.  Just let me know what im not asking that I should be asking.  I want to get as much as i can out of this post.  Thank you everyone for your time.        Whats a good camera, to begin with.        What are some good books to get and read?      Also, is there course(s) to look for in fort lauderdale or orlando florida?      What are the pros and cons of the camera?   I know im either going to go Canon or Nikon unless someone can convince me otherwise.        Any insight and personal experience i would love to hear greatly.      Pictures are worth a 1000 words, but I want mine to leave the world speechless.        Have a great day everyone and thank you again.            What else should I consider about camera's that beginners might not be fully aware of.

20090128203914AAFBtZz	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Dance team is in May, I need help with leaps/turns/battements?!?	I'm 19 and in a community college, and cheer/dance tryouts are on May 8.  For cheer, you just need to be able to do a toe touch, arm motions, and a cheer routine (tumbling is not required but they don't stunt because of an incident in which a flyer fell and broke her neck a few years ago), but for dance, you need to do turns, leaps, and kicks.  I've always wanted to be a cheerleader or a dancer.  I'm taking a choreography class which is also the same time the cheer/dance/hip hop team practices (which are all under the same coach as well as the choreography class) and I'm taking her jazz dance class.  I took her jazz dance class last year (but didn't like it at the time, now I love it) and I tried out for cheer but didn't make it; she thought I had potential but just needed to clean up my arm movements and some other stuff, and this morning she said she will try put me on a team since she knows how hard I'm willing to work for it though.  Here's the thing though:  I'm inflexible and I can't do splits, and I know you need them for leaps and kicks.  I stretch as much as I can and practice my splits, and little by little, I'm getting a bit more flexible.  Is it possible to get at least my side splits by May (since I know they are easier to get than the center splits...can anyone explain why?) Also, what exercises can I do so I can kick high AND be able to leap?  Oh, and I'm not one of those girls who have been dancing since I was a kid; I just took on and off classes but never actually been on a team or anything; but I want it really bad, it's one of those things that you REALLY want deep inside, and no matter how much you try to ignore it, that desire is still there...I have the heart for it, and I'm willing to work hard and improve my technique and flexibility.
