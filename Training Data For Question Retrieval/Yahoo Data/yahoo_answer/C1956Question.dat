20090220035753AAdIyeK	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Orange mobile phone / Orange Wednesday question?	My wife has an Orange mobile.  The SIM is brand new and it has been registered.  The phone works.  We have not topped it up but have a ï¿¡1 credit from Orange that is valid.  We have tried to access the "Orange Wednesday" promotion. We have sent the correct text to the correct number.  No response received.  Re-tried.  Still no reply.      So I call Orange Customer Services. I was put though to an Indian Call-Centre.  I was told that the ï¿¡1 credit is valid and that the Orange Wednesday promotion works as follows:      You send the text.  A reply is NOT guaranteed. If one is "lucky" then one receives a text ticket and is charged 35p.  This might take 5 minutes.  If one is not lucky then one will received nothing and will not be charged.      Is this correct?  There is nothing on the website about "being lucky".  The website says "send a text, receive your ticket, go to the cinema".      Can someone educate me as to how this scheme actually works?  Have I been instructed correctly or was that a load of rubbish?      Thanks

Could someone explain me please - some basic things about Formating a SD card ...  So- I've got a Nikon D80 , and the SD card has 8gb , when the SD card was new - it was enough memory for 2000 pictures ( large Format ) . I used to delete  unwanted pictures by formating the memory card . After formating  several times  I noticed  that there is enough memory for 1000 pictures  only ( insteed of 2000 - like it was before ) .     Or I  have to do something in my camera settings ?

20090220074444AAxrsFi	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	How to connect Wharfedale monitors to Audio Interface?	Hi everybody i'm new into these audio equipments. I have an Edirol UA-25 A/I with balanced I/O connected to my PC via USB and a pair of Wharfedale 8.2 Pro Active Studio Monitors. i believe there's a XLR port behind each of the monitor. Here are 2 situations:       If i want to use them for monitoring my audio in Adobe Audition so how  am i going to connect the monitors to my Edirol UA-25? What type of cable (preferably high quality) should i use?       If i want to use for leisure listening, can i just straight away plug into my sound card audio jacks with adapters or converter or something, so in this case without the Edirol? (it is unnecessarily to turn on Edirol without really using it)         Thank you.

Hi, I have have been considering buying a 30mm lens hood for my Sony DCR-DVD610 camcorder to reduce glare and help protect the lens. Now, there are two from Mennon I have been looking at.      Question 1: Will it make a difference if the hood is silver? One color they have is silver, and another is black. Will the color make any difference in the picture?      Question 2: Since my camera is a 16:9 camera, will the edges of the hood show when the camera is in 16:9 (it's not a fake 16:9, since the LCD is widescreen, and in 4:3 mode the edges are just cut off)?

I spent hours on the phone with Verizon and they couldnt fix it. I went and had my old phone reactivated and that worked all last night and this morning until i went to work. Now my old phone, a LG flip style phone wont send or receive texts, and the calls never connect. Could there be something at my job that could be causing this? I have worked there for years and all my other co-workers Verizon phones work. Anyone have any ideas?

20090220070212AAXGwbW	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Using an English Playstation 2 in Italy?	I have a Slimline Sony PS2 which I no longer uses. I would like to take it out to Italy so I can use it out there on the TV in our apartment. However, as you may know the voltage in Italy is different to ours here in England. I was wondering if it is possible to take the PS2 out to Italy and use some form of adaptor which would allow it to be used. I don't think a normal English 3-pin to Italian 2- or 3-pin plug adaptor would work as it doesn't increase the voltage and therefore the console would not receive enough power.      I would be grateful for any suggestions or advice from anyone who has done this.      :)      Thanks
