20090309183906AAe8oBC	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Should School Sweatpants have writing on the butt?	Our school has a clothing orderform like most normal high schools do.On our schools clothing orderform is sweatpants. Now I have nothing against school sweatpants and actually own a pair. Our schools sweatpants come in either grey or navy, and have STA written in Light Green lettering down the left leg. Here's the odd part, we are the STA THUNDER and written across the BUTT of the sweatpants in White on the Navy sweats and Dark Blue on the grey sweats is THUNDER. Now Its one thing to own a pair of school sweatpants. It may even be acceptable if STA was written across the butt, But THUNDER is just provocative and gives a reason for people to look at your butt. You'd think these sweats would be unpopular, but most self respecting girls and even a few guys (non gay) own and wear them regularly. Personally, I never really seen a problem until I ordered a pair and wore them to school. My pair is grey and I realized after that day after looking in a mirror and provocative it really is. In my opinion, it is not as fair for guys. Regardless, ALOT of guys actually wear them as they have no other choice. I personally try to wear them once a week or so as they are very comfy, but of course I feel awkward with THUNDER plastered in giant letters across my behind. Its weird to think how much the "THUNDER" would be bopping around on my behind.What is your opinion on this matter?

I have sensitive skin that is acne prone and dries out easily (but also gets oily no matter how dry my skin is when I wear makeup). I have a moisturizer that isn't fragrance free, and it's irritating my skin quite a bit. What is the best for me? I've got a list of a few I'd be willing to try:      1. Vaseline Intensive Rescue Moisture Locking Lotion:  http://www.drugstore.com:80/products/pro...       2. Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion:  http://www.drugstore.com:80/products/pro...       3. CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion:  http://www.drugstore.com:80/products/pro...          I'm fairly sure that although a cream would provide the right amount of moisture, it will also be too heavy & will clog my pores. If you have any other suggestions, please do make them.
20090309202535AAErH3e	Beauty & Style;Makeup	What is some good eyeliner that WON'T run!?	For years now I've looked for some good eyeliner that won't run but I can't seem to find anything. My eyeliner runs and then it makes me have "racoon eyes" in other words black all under-neath my eyes.   I've used water-proof, regular, long lasting everything!! I have oily skin and that makes my make-up run. And it's getting even worse now because here in south florida the temperatures are really getting up there. Anyways I do use face powder under my eyes which helps a little but definitly doesn't cure the problem. I also don't apply the eyeliner at the corner of my eyes so it won't run which also helps some but not completely.     If you have any ideas for me to try or a good brand that works it would be VERY much appreciated!       Thanks

I feel that if I actually tried caring about my appearance, I could be very, very pretty. The thing is, I don't know HOW to do it. I see the popular girls at my school with the most perfect complexion, amazing make-up, super smooth, FLAWLESS hair, the perfect body, and the hot boyfriends. Obviously, I sound pretty jealous. I don't know how they do it!   I've never tried doing anything 'out-of-the-ordinary' with my hair, and when I try it always looks stupid. Make-up doesn't even interest me, and I am at such a loss when it comes to applying it.    Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I want to look pretty without looking like a plastic, perfect fake like the popular girls. I just want a clear complexion, basic make-up to show off my eyes, and really nice hair.    I just don't know how to start! Any tips?

I always wanted to have one or more tattoos, ones that mean something to me, yet Ive always been scared to hell about how this may affect me on the long run (job, marriage, old age, etc). In a couple of months my girl is going to get some free ink for her birthday, I might join her and get some myself; the strongest tattoo idea Ive had the past month is three words across my back, all three between shoulders: Honor Sacrificio Valor (honor sacrifice and valor in spanish). These are values Ive had since Im 12 and they've gotten me through a lot tough things. Im 19, and I can't stop wondering if Im going to, for one reason or another, be regretting it in the next 20 years. Any one here with a text tattoo regret getting it a few years later? Why would you if you don't? Any advice related to what Ive said is very much welcome. Thank you.

20070614182957AAj1Qhb	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	For those of you who likes Barbie better.....?	Good luck. Barbie is falling way behind while Bratz made it to the finish line. Don't get me wrong, I happen to like Barbie. Less than I used to though, but she is slowly disappearing and I hardly see her in toy stores or any other stores for that matter. I happen to have a little cousin and she doesn't even know who Barbie is! Bratz won and even though you despise them, they still won and they're getting really popular. Face it. No one wants a doctor Barbie. Instead kids want a Bratz doll with sparkly cool clothes. They don't even sell astronaut Barbie, so you might as well cut the crap with all that "Barbie was a teacher, a vet, a doctor, etc." junk . Sure they sell it at ebay, amazon and all that. But soon they won't be on the internet anymore, just like there's hardly any in the stores. This is a new generation people, kids don't want 50 year old dolls. But atleast Barbie will always be in your hearts. And here is my question. How do you feel about Barbie, slowly fading away?

20080704065837AAbIMTK	Beauty & Style;Makeup	My foundation keeps clogging my poors. what's a good foundation to use?	I have always used almay because it's the only foundation that doesn't break my face out.  I have to be carerfull with shampoos and hairsprays and everything because they will break my face out.  Neutrogena sometimes works but the last one I used broke my face out.  Physicans formula works ok.  The almay doesn't break my face out it's just clogging my pores which can cause one or two break outs and is causing more oily skin.  I have to keep washing my face.  It's why I hate wearing make-up.  Any suggestions?  I have really sensitive skin.  If it makes any difference my skin is really fair I have a reddish tone to my skin.  I'm told that's typical with senstive skin.

So, here is a long string of questions about it: Do I have a shot at tween modeling (I'm 13)? Pic:  http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2z8xjiw&...  Do you have to have a lot of money to be a tween model? Do you have to take some sort of class? Do you have to have contacts? Are there places to go if you are interested in tween modeling? Is it hard to get into tween modeling? Is there anything else I need to know about tween modeling? I really want to make money, my family needs it, and this could be a way...maybe, if I found out more about it.

I have about 15 pairs total, but most of them are older so I wanted to buy some new ones. I was talking to a friend the other day who also had another friend of hers over and we were talking about going to the mall. I thought it was a good idea, and I said that I needed to go into Victoria's Secret for some new underwear. It was after I said this that my friend's friend goes, "Eww, Victoria's Secret?! They're so expensive and their underwear isn't even that cute...you're a little too old for their underwear anyway." So, I would like to hear other peoples thoughts on this. Do you think the underwear are really that expensive (I buy them 5 for $25) and do you think, being 18 years old, that I am too old to be wearing their PINK underwear?

Okay, A few months ago I was in a really bad car crash that almost took my life, so i'm looking for a little change now. I'm thinking about going blonde.

My boyfriend and I were watching a documentary about human genes and natural selection etc. Some of the stuff that we heard was that blue eyes are recessive, and rare... Same with blonde hair. Brown eyes are dominant and brown hair is dominant, also. My boyfriend has light blue eyes and ash hair. I am white skinned and have brown eyes and brown hair...*yawns*. (I don't have much faith in my looks because the media has killed off any belief I had in pale skin/and the brown eyes&hair combo). Anyway, my boyfriend and I were talking and he blatantly told me that his genes are superior and that mine are inferior because I have 'common' colouring. I was quite taken aback, and argued the point. My lovely boyfriend proceeded to tell me that brown eyes are the ugliest colour. He ended by saying that Caucasian people with my colourings are an insult to the Caucasian race. Suffice to say, I am stunned, and rather disturbed. Umm... so... I would like to ask you if you agree with him? Am I common and nasty because I am pale and have brown hair and brown eyes?    im a 21 y.o female my bf is 21.

20081108183205AA4yjMo	Beauty & Style;Hair	Should I cut my hair shorter?	So I cut off most of my hair, and now it looks like this:  http://mcrweirdo.deviantart.com/art/New-...       but she cut it a little wrong and I wanted to go a bit shorter. All my friends that are girls say that I could pull it off fine and Id still look like a girl, but my boyfriend says that Id look like a man and he liked it better long and I should grow it back. If i cut it again it would most likely look like this:  http://mcrweirdo.deviantart.com/art/Sign...       Would that look okay?   Any suggestions for cute short hairstyles?
