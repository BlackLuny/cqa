tOCESHLYaa	There is no reason to think you have got infected. First thing you should try is to power down your router and modem. Make sure your computer is off. Unplug your router, and unplug your modem. Wait 30 seconds then in this order plug in your modem wait about 30 seconds. Then plug in your router wait at least 30 seconds, Then turn on your computer. Go online and see if that helps. If that does not help get Ccleaner from download.com and run it. It is a good file cleaner and will clean out your temp. internet files. If you have a paid version of Norton then you have malware protection. Malware includes computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, most rootkits, spyware, dishonest adware, crimeware and other malicious and unwanted software. If you don't have any signs of Malware you could still have but most of the time computers slowing down could have several problems.

3LjMWownaa	well, typically any LCD monitor can display 1080p and 720p fine.  since they are all High def.  the only difference is, depending on the max resolution size of the monitor, and the 1080p default resolution.  I have a 22" monitor and the only thing a 1080p video will do is go outside of the actual viewing area depending on your resolution.  Such as moving a window off the screen.  Mine is 1680x1050 in resolution.  The aspect ratio for a 1080p movie is 1920x800.  So the sides would be cut off a bit, but go full screen and there it all is, just a smaller resolution, but not by much.  Hope this helps.  If you want to make use of the full 1080, get a monitor that's resolution can be set to 1920x800 or higher..  They are usually displayed as 1080p monitors.  Meaning you can go the full resolution of the video and watch it in true 1080p<br>  <br>  So, if your monitor's resolution can't be set to 1920x800, don't worry.  The video isn't going to lose any quality, its still all there and watchable.

FjCcc561aa	Pf as a transparent bridging firewall on FreeBSD 6 and 7<br>  <br>  The Goal:<br>  <br>  A way to transparently protect a set of servers as well as monitor the inbound and outbound traffic to said servers.<br>  <br>  <br>  Solution:<br>  <br>  The end solution was to install FreeBSD 6.2 or 7.0 Release on a server and utilize packet filter (pf) as a transparent bridge to meet the IP addressing requirements.<br>  <br>  <br>  Howto:<br>  <br>  1.) Install FreeBSD<br>  <br>  We have a checklist list of tasks to perform to install and lock down our production servers. Follow your own best practices to get a basic install of FreeBSD 6.2 or 7.0 running and patched. Install the minimal amount of options and packages necessary.<br>  <br>  You will need, or at least you will most likely want, a third NIC installed in the server. In a transparent bridge the WAN and LAN interfaces become “transparent” and no longer take an IP address. So without the third NIC installed and connected to your network you will have no way to remotely manage the server. A benefit of this though is that without an IP address to attack your transparent bridging firewall itself would be free from attack.<br>  <br>  Pf is available in a default install by re-compiling the kernel with specific changes made, or by enabling pf via kernel loadable module.<br>  <br>  We re-compiled the kernel. The options below were added at the end of the kernel source and the new kernel compiled:<br>  <br>  # pf support<br>  device pf # Packet Filter firewall<br>  device pflog # PF logging facility<br>  device pfsync # PF state syncing<br>  <br>  # ALTQ support<br>  options ALTQ<br>  options ALTQ_CBQ<br>  options ALTQ_RED<br>  options ALTQ_RIO<br>  options ALTQ_HFSC<br>  options ALTQ_PRIQ<br>  <br>  2.) Configure your third NIC with an IP address and verify you can remotely access your server.<br>  <br>  In the /etc/rc.conf file we have the following definition for the management IF:<br>  <br>  ifconfig_fxp0=”inet 123.123.123.2 netmask 255.255.255.0″<br>  <br>  We will be building pf rules for this NIC as well to protect the firewall itself.<br>  <br>  3.) Create the bridge between the two desired interfaces.<br>  <br>  Use your favorite editor to edit /etc/rc.conf and enable the bridge<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  <br>  cloned_interfaces=”bridge0″<br>  ifconfig_bridge0=”addm bge0 addm nfe0 up”<br>  ifconfig_bge0=”up”<br>  ifconfig_nfe0=”up”<br>  <br>  In this case we are bridging the two interfaces bge0 and nfe0.<br>  <br>  Use your favorite editor to edit /etc/sysctl.conf<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  <br>  net.link.bridge.pfil_onlyip=1<br>  net.link.bridge.pfil_member=1<br>  net.link.bridge.pfil_bridge=0<br>  <br>  4.) Enable the use of pf on your server.<br>  <br>  Use your favorite editor to edit /etc/rc.conf and enable the use of pf<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  <br>  pf_enable=”YES” # enable PF (load module if required)<br>  pf_rules=”/etc/pf-bridge.conf” # rules definition file for pf<br>  pf_flags=”" # additional flags for pfctl startup<br>  pflog_enable=”YES” # start pflogd(8)<br>  pflog_logfile=”/var/log/pflog” # where pflogd should store the logfile<br>  pflog_flags=”" # additional flags for pflogd startup<br>  <br>  5.) Build the firewall ruleset.<br>  <br>  First make a copy of the default ruleset and designate it as a bridging ruleset.<br>  <br>  # cp /etc/pf.conf /etc/pf-bridge.conf<br>  <br>  Use your favorite editor to edit /etc/pf-bridge.conf. Place your ruleset within the pf-bridge.conf file and save the changes.<br>  <br>  Here is the sample ruleset: pf-bridge_generic.txt<br>  <br>  6.) Apply the rules and enable the firewall.<br>  <br>  Finally to actually enable a new ruleset we need to tell pf to read the config file. This would also automatically happen upon reboot.<br>  <br>  # pfctl –f /etc/pf-bridge.conf<br>  # pfctl –e<br>  <br>  Thats it. You will now need to go through and test the bridge and verify you can access what you intended to allow access to, and that what you wanted to block is now blocked. Hopefully you still have access to the management interface as well. The best test will be to perform some form of vulnerability testing against IPs behind your firewall and the firewall itself.<br>  <br>  Some notes on the ruleset specifically:<br>  <br>  - There is really nothing in the ruleset that designates the firewall as a transparent bridge other than the absence of NAT rules. The bridge built in the OS itself in the /etc/rc.conf file is where the bridging is applied. - The IP addresses in the variable and table definitions will obviously have to be updated to fit a different environment. - Many options exist for pf and there are full books dedicated to the art of pf rulesets and using pf in general. This ruleset for example could be expanded to make more use of AltQ for QoS and added protection against DoS attacks.

ickyq53aaa	If I were you I would look for a paid mastering service, and not rely on someone that does not have a business reputation.  You don't want to get ripped off, and you don't want some tone-deaf moron mastering your mixes.  Most mastering services work with ProTools, so it would probably be easy to find one to work on your files.  And if your recordings are scratchy, that is hard to correct, and usually would require a re-recording.  Eliminating scratchy sounds with a sound remover will affect the whole feel and sound of your songs.  If you want, I could give it a shot.  I would probably just import the song (I would prefer a wave file) into Reason, which has a killer mastering suite that I have used a bit.  I don't have much practice mastering in ProTools.  Email me through my profile, and I will send you my real email address if you want.

FjCcc561aa	Those familiar with Java recognize the security concept of a sandbox. For those that aren't, it's the concept that everyone gets a unique, well-equipped sandbox to play in, and a person in one sandbox isn't allowed into anyone else's sandbox, not even to share anything with anyone else. On FreeBSD, jails implement this concept — they keep processes in their own part of the system, denying access to anything else. A jail requires its own dedicated IP address, though, which can make life difficult for those with limited address space. If this presents you with a hardship, consider at least using chroot. It won't afford you as much security, but it does help.<br>  <br>  How does this help security? Take, for example, a box with an external FTP server and the company extranet. An exploit for the server is discovered, and a cracker manages to gain root access through the FTP daemon. If the FTP server is not run in a sandbox or jail, the cracker will have access to everything on the machine, including sensitive information destined for the company's partners through the extranet. If, however, the FTP server is run in a jail, the cracker will only have access to the FTP files.<br>  <br>  There are, of course, still potential risks. If you run at secure level 0, the cracker can simply access the raw disk device and read data from there. The solution is obvious — on a box sensitive enough to require jails, use appropriate secure levels as well. This will eliminate a cracker's ability to read from or write to raw disk devices. Configuring a Jail<br>  <br>  Configuring a jail is pleasantly simple.<br>  <br>  First, ensure that your system environment is jail-friendly. Because each jail requires its own IP address, the services on your box must be configured to listen to specific addresses, not just every available address. For example, if the box's addresses are 199.232.41.26 (main) and 199.232.41.27 (jail), to get inetd to listen only on 199.232.41.26, add inetd_flags="-wW -a 199.232.41.26" to /etc/rc.conf. If you fail to do this, conflicts may occur over the aliased IP address.<br>  <br>  For some daemons, this is not an easy process — sendmail and rpcbind are two examples. If you're using these services on your box, you might consider simply running them inside of a jail of their own. After configuring all of the non-jailed daemons to listen to a specific address, reboot the machine. This will put everything into a known state, eliminating any potential for confusion.<br>  <br>  With the proper host environment in place, create the directory that will house the jail. In this example, it's /usr/jail/ftp. Now go to /usr/src and run:<br>  <br>  # cd /usr/src<br>  # make world DESTDIR=/usr/jail/ftp<br>  # cd etc<br>  # make distribution DESTDIR=/usr/jail/ftp<br>  # cd /usr/jail/ftp/dev<br>  # sh<br>  # MAKEDEV jail<br>  <br>  # cd ..<br>  # ln -sf /dev/null kernel<br>  <br>  These commands build the jail and populate it with all of the tools that your processes will need to run. Actually, they put in a lot more than just what your processes will need. For example, perl, gcc, and sendmail will all be installed, but you probably don't need them in your jail. Keep in mind, though, that it's a lot easier to take stuff out until something breaks than it is to put stuff back in until everything works.<br>  <br>  To configure the jail environment, you might want to copy /stand/sysinstall into /usr/jail/ftp/stand, to provide you with an easy configuration interface. I'll show you how to use it in just a second.<br>  <br>  With the system rebooted, you're now ready to configure the jail environment. Start the jail for the first time by running:<br>  <br>  # jail /usr/jail/ftp jail.hostname.com 199.232.41.27 /bin/sh<br>  <br>  This will put you at a shell prompt in your jail environment. From here, you can run /stand/sysinstall (literally, since / now refers to the jail's root directory, not the system's.)<br>  <br>  There are several configuration tasks to perform, such as setting the root password (don't make it the same as the main system root password!), adding user accounts, and configuring /etc/resolv.conf. Read man 8 jail for more configuration tasks that you'll need to perform. Keep in mind that you want to be able to log in to the environment, so consider running an SSH daemon inside the jail.<br>  <br>  Once you're done configuring the jail environment, exit the shell and the jail will be shut down.<br>  <br>  You're almost ready to start the jail "for real." First, add the appropriate IP address alias. For our example, this is done via:<br>  <br>  ifconfig fxp0 inet alias 199.232.41.27 255.255.255.255<br>  <br>  You can configure this in /etc/rc.conf to be done automatically at boot.<br>  <br>  Now, let's start the jail! This is done with two commands:<br>  <br>  # mount -t procfs proc /usr/jail/ftp/proc<br>  # jail /usr/jail/ftp jail.hostname.com 199.232.41.27 /bin/sh /etc/rc<br>  <br>  You'll see some warning messages scroll by, but don't worry about them. You can now see all the daemons running inside the jail, as indicated by the J flag shown in the ps output. If you enabled SSH within the jail, you can ssh to

It could be that perhaps you’re a bit under the minimum system requirements to run the version you’ve got on your computer.<br>  <br>  Just as reference, here’s a link to the system requirements for the Live Essentials (which Windows Movie Maker is a part of). Check your system and make sure it meets the requirements.<br>  <a href="http://download.live.com/SystemRequirements.aspx." rel="nofollow">http://download.live.com/SystemRequireme...</a><br>  <br>  If you’re still having problems after that, and you meet the requirements, feel free to reach out.

No matter what you copy to your flash drive and bring to school, it will not work.<br>  But if copy the whole installation CD of Microsoft Word to your flash drive and then INSTALL from there on your school computer, it will work.|`|RE4AaDQBaa	I have done the copy/paste with the entire folder before, mostly out of curiosity. Then I did the right-click/send to desktop on the .exe file, which gave me a shortcut to start the program. It did work in a few cases, it will just depend on how complex the program is, and whether it can reside in the single folder you create, and still work. That's why you would do best to copy the install program when you can. There may be another way to do it, but I don't know about it.|`|tkjWzb4iaa	i would recommend putting the installation program on to the flash drive as alot of times if you just copy the folder onto it it tends to mess up. If your school computers blocked installing then you can try the folder it doesnt always mess up but your better off if you can just install it with the installer.|`|Z2cbezZDaa	Your school has locked down their computers precisely to stop you doing stuff like this.<br>  <br>  With Linux you can make a bootable memory stick - essentially like running a Live CD. Whether that would then enable you to install and run the app you want is moot.<br>  <br>  However, if I was your school's IT manager, I'd have removed the USB port from the boot source list. If you know how to interrupt the boot sequence and reinstate the BIOS option, then good luck. Again, if I was a teacher at your school, I'd regard anything like this as abuse, and discipline you accordingly.<br>  <br>  So, yes, technically feasible, but, no, not a good idea.|`|dtE5GHh7aa	maybe you can try FLV Converter SDK,it offers professional solutions for you to convert FLV to video files of various formats directly online with command line mode, and this set of SDK can enable your multimedia programs to convert the FLV files in the customized way. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://flvsdk.com/" rel="nofollow">http://flvsdk.com/</a>
AA11629848	Adding to what "Your Add Here" said, use tags. To have more views on your videos try posting them as a video response to other popular videos, also when writing the description and "Tags" use as many popular keywords you can imagine. Here's a list of the most popular searches on YouTube by ranking: <br>  <br>  1 Sex<br>  2 Lil Wayne<br>  3 Low<br>  4 Chris Brown<br>  5 No Air<br>  6 Porn<br>  7 Family Guy<br>  8 Soulja Boy<br>  9 Naruto<br>  10 Funny<br>  11 Jonas Brothers<br>  12 Usher<br>  13 Hannah Montana<br>  14 Jeff Dunham<br>  15 Miley Cyrus<br>  16 Jabbawockeez<br>  17 Touch My Body<br>  18 Love Song<br>  19 Fights<br>  20 American Idol<br>  21 Bleeding Love<br>  22 Mariah Carey<br>  23 With You<br>  24 Sexy Can I<br>  25 WWE<br>  <br>  Use them in your tags and your video will show up every time someone use one of those keywords on a search.|`|1EN9ngsbaa	You can promote yourself on yahoo answers, but that will only take you so far.  to be better, ou should try to be really good with tags. I mean, dont just put in "fireworks, explosion" if your video is about fireworks. Try to use all types of things, like "fireworks, Explosion, colorful, pattern, night, time, dark fire, launch, sparks" stuff like that.<br>  <br>  And it would also help to have a great title. Something like "Fourth of July Fireworks" probaly wont rack in alot of views. Something like "Fireworks are pretty..." would probaly get more, but not as many as "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" Just make sure not to lie to your viewers, but if you really do lit the fireworks off, that would be an appropriate title.<br>  <br>  Another great thing to do it to have a great thumbnail. I disagree throughly with people who put something like a women with her shirt almost off as the thumbnail, because most of the time that has nothing to do with the video. Most of the time they just times it there so it would flash for a second, then continue on with the video. What YOU should do is if your video is about fireworks, and you names it "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" then maybe the middle frame should be you with a lighter on next to your face. Something to get viewers to go "ot oh, what is that guy going to do?" Just make sure that that lighter part is legitinmetly about your video.<br>  <br>  One of the best things to do is to make your video a response to a very popular video, or to a new video that might not have alot of views yet, but their subscriber count is high. <br>  <br>  For example, if you make a video talking about some bizzare news story, and sXephil, A popular youtuber, mentions the same story in his video, make it a video response to it. With a good thumbnail, it should rack in the viewers. Or if your video is a video about how to do something, like make something, or a trick on the computer, make your video a repsonse to one of householdhacker new video.<br>  <br>  If you do want to have an extra boost in your video veiws, you could use an atuo refrsher. mind you, THIS IS AGAINST THE YOUTUBE RULES. if youtube catches you, you could get suspened or even banned. to download a atuop refresher, click here: <a href="http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo..." rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo...</a><br>  <br>  There is a quick and easy way to get more channel views though, and this IS legal, it is for now anyways. they might soon change that. but you can download a channel refrsher if you want. to learn more about it, watch this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk...</a><br>  <br>  It also helps to have external links from youtube.

Drg3bLjUaa	go to your pc's help section...<br>  <br>  heres what mine says....The type of recordable DVD you should use depends on your DVD burner, as well as on your DVD player. Certain DVD burners can only burn to certain types of recordable DVDs. For example, with some DVD burners, you can only record to DVD+R or DVD+RW discs or to DVD-R or DVD-RW discs, while other DVD burners will let you burn to all of these recordable DVD types.<br>  <br>  As long as your DVD burner supports burning to these types of discs, you can use Windows DVD Maker to burn a DVD using one of the following types of recordable or re-recordable DVD media: DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and DVD-ROM. These recordable or re-recordable DVDs can be either single sided single layered or single sided dual layered.<br>  <br>  You should also consider the device you'll use to play the DVD once you've burned it, if possible. Some DVD players and DVD-ROM drives play only certain kinds of DVDs. To determine what types of DVDs your DVD player or DVD-ROM drive can play, check the documentation that came with your device or go to the manufacturer's website.|`|ylMZ4mSYaa	Aimersoft DVD Creator is a good choice.

b412254e11519aaa92cbe9efe511c454aa	Both pieces of art are Photoshop ready, i presume?  1.) Open both documents, the car and the logo. The next two step check your image mode. Both the car and logo need to be the same mode. If you do not know what mode you should be using, I suggest RGB. From the Image menu select Mode and check the following:  2.) Check the logo document then 3.) Check the Car document   Next check Image size. From the View menu, click "Actual Pixels" on both the logo and car documents. The documents should both show an image which is smooth and clear, sharp and focused. If not, you will not get good results but can proceed.  4. & 5.) For each document, set the resolution with the following steps,as follows: Access the Image menu, from it select Image Size, a dialog box opens, of the fields in the box, the "Document Size Resolution" value should be set to the same value on both the car document and the logo document. If this final image is to eventually be printed, these values should be appropriate for the quality of the print desired, the printer and the type of paper you'll print on. (150, 300) and the box with pixels per unit, set to match your needs. If the final document will be used only on screen (Email, internet, on your PC as an image) make  things more manageable and use 72 for the value and pixels per inch for the units. (NOTE: If you use a resolution value larger than 72, to view the document at actual size on screen, access the view menu and choose Print Size. If you use a value of 72, to view the document at actual size on screen, access view and actual pixels. This is important to set up correctly and use the right method to 'see' your document)  6.)Make sure your resolutions are the same and that the logos image size is large enough set up this way, to be good enough quality. If it is too big, this is OK, you can size it down, but if it is too small to begin with, the image will deteriorate when you increase it's size. Make sure your logo is usable as shown, or smaller. You're set up now. 7.) You have two documents open, focus your work on the image of the logo.  8a.) If the logo is the only thing in that image, use the select menu and "select all", else,8b.) if you need to delineate the logo from say a background, use the magic wand tool and create a selection of pixels which are only the logo, leaving out things you do not wish on the car as part of the unselected set.  9.) Focused on the logo document with the selected set, access the Edit menu and then choose copy. 10.) Switch focus to the car document, Access the edit menu choose paste. The logo documents selected set appears on the car document. If you check your layer palette, you'll see it remains isolated, in a layer of its own, on top of the car which is now it's own layer too. 11.) Use the move tool, make sure the logo layer is highlighted which will make a box with 6 control points around it appear on your logo. Use this tool and these points to adjust the position, size, even distort it to make it look 'in perspective'.  12.) For transforms to 'take' you need to click the green check mark that appears in your tool bar during the transformation. The red circle with slash will cancel changes and send the image back to its former state. 13.) There are some specific transforms that allow you to use precision adjustments in the Edit menu, transform, while this layer is selected. The rest is photoshop stuff...I've probably gone too deep as it is. Hope it helps

There is EXTREMELY GOOD REASON for physically wiring to your router!!!<br>  <br>  After you've cleaned up what you can with those two scans, then turn on your AV and firewall again and UPDATE _*ALL*_ of you anti-virus, anti-spyware and other anti-malware progs and then run them, too. Then KEEP them updated at least once a week and USE them after you update them. I update and use mine DAILY!<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work you'll have to take the infested computer to the shop to have it professionally cleaned and tuned up.<br>  <br>  BTW: DO _*NOT*_ use System Restore at all!

RoMxIa1Jaa	None of the *free* versions of ANY of the programs suggested give real-time protection  :-(<br>  <br>  * Spybot's SD Helper function gives browser immunization (not real-time protection).<br>  * Spybot's Tea Timer function (I personally don't recommend using the Tea Timer) alerts you to *every* registry change... from adding and removing programs to running a defragmentor. (Not real-time protection, but mostly a nuisance.)<br>  <br>  * The paid version of Spyware Doctor has real-time protection, but the real-time scanning of the free version is so very limited that it shouldn't even be considered as such :-(<br>  <br>  * The free version of Ad-Aware can't  be seriously considered as anything more than a cookie finder.<br>  <br>  NOW to answer your question:<br>  I use and recommend Comodo BOClean. <br>  It runs in the background and is effective in preventing a wide spectrum of malware. <br>  > Comodo BOClean: <a href="http://www.comodo.com/boclean/boclean.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.comodo.com/boclean/boclean.ht...</a>|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	I know windows defender does, but that isn't a great program.

vF2rwFeYaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  You'll need to goto website of the manufacturer of your network card and update the drivers because SP3 replaces the default wlanapi.dll most network cards use with their version.<br>  <br>  In the meanwhile you can disable WZSLDR2.exe by pressing Microsoft flag key and R key togther and typing in run box:<br>  <br>  ??MSCONFIG??hit ENTER key<br>  <br>  Uncheck the box next to WZCSLDR2.exe at bootup.<br>  <br>  Also, you can try the following:<br>  <br>  1.  Press Microsoft flag key and R key together<br>  <br>  2.  In run box type:??services.mcs??hit ENTER key<br>  <br>  3.  Scroll to the bottom and you will see "Wired AutoConfig".  This is a new feature with SP3 and needs to be enabled so we will want to Right-click and select Properties.<br>  <br>  There will be a Drop-down box that by default says 'Manual'.  This needs to be changed to Automatic. Then Click OK.<br>  <br>  4.  Now Right-click on "Wired AutoConfig" Again and Choose, "Start" Since the service hasn't officially been started we need to start it.<br>  <br>  5.

fCOq04lNaa	A couple of things:<br>  1. You are not going to get away with running Vista with 512MB of RAM. Vista sucks on anything with less than 2GB of actual RAM. <br>  <br>  2. A 9800 Gt probably won't work because you're power supply is most likely inadequate. It will fit one though as you have a PCI-Express slot.<br>  <br>  So I'd recommend doing the following:<br>  <br>  Get a Radeon 4830. This is slightly better than a 9800 GT while costing significantly less.<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102803" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  You also need a power supply upgrade in order to run a 4830.

If its under $100 you could get a good video card from models ranging from the 8400GT to the 9800GT depending on where you buy it and what edition.  <br>  <br>  Anything above $100 you can get a high end video card.

wUqeZl3Saa	Email is sent as plaintext. There are no options for encryption that the banks will accept since they would all have to adopt the same thing and get it standardized. There isn't anything that is standardized for email.<br>  <br>  The web access is secured using normal security protocols and standard encryption. There used to be a big secret regarding the RC4 algorithm, but it was made public several years ago. In fact the reason it is all trusted, is because the security protocols are public knowledge and have been reviewed by many people. It is a trusted standard and it gives the banks an out if anything were to fail. Online banking is safer than giving your info to the kid at the checkout.<br>  <br>  Speculation as to why the banks don't do it is because there is no automated standardized mechanism to create secure email. There are several "snake oil" encryption programs available and there are a few good encryption programs. The problem is that it isn't embedded like it is with a secure web page. In other words, the user could actually choose a bad encryption program or make a mistake and send it unencrypted. Would you then blame the bank for your mistake? What if the bank made the same mistake? If it is automated, then there are no mistakes to be made. And email can't be automated since you have to deal with secure key exchanges and other security problems. Email is pretty much one sided in nature.<br>  <br>  You can send anything by email if you make that choice. However, there may be consequences if the email fell into the wrong hands.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Most financial websites (banks, credit cards) have a Secure Message Service for their customers simply because ordinary e-mail cannot be 100% secure.  A bank will only use ordinary e-mail for routine things (notifying you that you have a new statement) that don't include confidential information.<br>  This is why any e-mail supposedly from a bank asking for confidential information is guaranteed to be a fake - banks just don't do that.<br>  The security features of a bank/credit card website are not public knowledge for obvious reasons|`|8yAQjqRpaa	its encrypted. you can get encrypted email but it not 100% free www.hushmail.com or www.perfectlyprivate.com

(Read up in any computer magazine and they will confirm that there is none.)

TXy9hI1Aaa	Okay, first off you need to provide us with the OS.<br>  <br>  For windows XP - sure, why not. XP runs fine on 1GB of RAM, but would be smoother on 2GB.<br>  <br>  Vista, you will experience some LAG. However, 1GB regardless is more than enough to surf the net, go to myspace, etc. <br>  <br>  In terms of HD space, 160GB is plenty, unless you have a lot of music or pictures.<br>  <br>  My suggestion however is not to worry so much about RAM or HD. Laptop ram is cheap. I recently bought my GF a HP netbook 1000 and for 100 dollars cheaper I got the 1GB. I went to my local frys, and for $20 dollars swapped in 2GB of RAM. Took less than 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  Also for HD space, if you max out its not too hard to find a cheap external for about $100 or less. Plus it gives you the added security to back up. The most important thing about the laptop is if you like it, its the correct size, the screen is satisfying to you. Don't worry about the ram or HD too much, as those two features can always be changed after the purchase.<br>  <br>  Bottom line...don't overspend on these.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	It is if you are running XP, you need another gig of memory to run Vista efficiently|`|ykXzzx65aa	Yea 160 gb Hdd and 1 gb memory is perfect for that kind of stuff|`|P8dIznazaa	It should be fine for those purposes--though if I were buying a new computer right now (which I am, though I'm looking at desktops), I would invest in more so it ages more gracefully.  Especially if you get into storing and/or editing videos, you needs will expand exponentially.  Personally, I would opt for 2GB of RAM and at *least* a 250GB hard drive.  For my desktop, I plan to get a 500GB drive, but you might need to go with something smaller for a laptop.|`|f6rHiAe2aa	hell yes...I have a HP PC and it only has 59 GBs for anything and 1GB for memory...but then when I get updates it completely blows away the 1GB for memory for up to 5GBs|`|oMHavrV9aa	This would be the bare minimum.

901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	The top three brands are HP, Toshibia and Sony. If you go to bestbuy.com, you'll find a ton of laptops under 600 dollars. Also don't confuse a netbook with a laptop. Though netbooks are nicely priced they are not exactly a laptop.|`|nDaLHm3Daa	On a personal level, I would say that the Sony VAIO is the best out there. I understand money is a big problem but hey, you must invest in yourself. However, if you still want to conserve, the HP laptops are good as well. I mean I have seen it in action at my friends house. The laptop is quite fast. Once in a while, there is a really good sale so you could expect a Pentium 4 laptop around $500. But generally speaking, if you want a laptop that is not associated with the Stone Age, $600 is too small. I mean the best thing to do is research what each laptop does. HP or Sony laptops that are more modern provide the newest softwares so they won't be a hastle and the laptops aer good to go as soon as you get them. They also have built in WiFi so internet is in a way free if you have DSL and a router.|`|hTbmBsSJaa	compaq

At the end of that time it stops letting you edit your files or create new ones.  You have to purchase Microsoft Office 2007, or at least Word 2007, to do that.<br>  <br>  Like being hooked like a fish, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Note:  The 25-character product key on the computer case or laptop bottom is NOT the key for MS Office.  It’s only for the Windows operating system.<br>  <br>  Here are some of your options:<br>  <br>  First, if you're a student, you may qualify for the Student edition of Office at a pretty good price:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/student/discounts/theultimatesteal-us/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/student/discoun...</a><br>  <br>  Second, if you’re interested in buying Word, check out this URL, especially the second group of listings. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/FX101754511033.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Note that the higher of the two prices quoted is for a full version of that program and the lower, for upgrades from existing software.  Read the list of upgrade-qualifying software carefully:  MS Works is often one, and may have come on your machine.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you have files that are locked up in the new Word 2007 file format (.docx), here’s a possibility for salvaging them.  Microsoft offers a free Compatibility pack that allows earlier versions of Word to read Word 2007 files.  If you have access to an earlier version, this can at least give you back your documents.  Some new features of Word 2007 will be lost or converted to straight text in the conversion to the earlier version.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

MPldgkkMaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

Then press ALT and 3 on your keyboard at the same time.  When you release the keys the ? should appear.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a keypad, try "Character Map" on Windows.  It's at "START - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools -  Character Map".  There's a drop-down menu on top, click on that and scroll down until you get to "Arial".  Select "Arial" and scroll down.  About 3/4s of the down you should see a ? on the left-hand side.  Click on the ?, then click on 'Select"  The ? will appear in the "Characters to copy:" box.  Then click on "Copy".  You will then have ? to paste into whatever you're writng.<br>  <br>  It's a little to late for Valentine's day ?, but it's never to early for St. Patrick's day. ?

3ad817d3a7c616e12c62791409f9e69eaa	Yes, sed is the answer. If your filename is test.txt, then use something like the following: <br>  <br>  sed -E "s/[      ]+/,/g" test.txt<br>  <br>  Note: Between the square brackets, there's a space character followed by a tab character. But to insert the tab character, you need to type ctrl-v followed by ctrl-i. Yes, I know that seems very bizarre (especially if you know something about regular expressions and expect "\t" to work for tab characters), but that 's what I had to do. <br>  <br>  So for clarity's sake, here's how you enter the sed command from the command line (assuming your test.txt file already exists): <br>  Type "sed" followed by a space and "-E" and another space. <br>  Type a double-quote followed by "s" followed by a forward-slash followed by a left square bracket. <br>  Type a space followed by ctrl-v followed by ctrl-i.<br>  Type a right square bracket followed by a plus sign.<br>  Type a forward-slash followed by a comma. <br>  Type another forward-slash followed by a lowercase "g" followed by a double-quote. <br>  Type a space followed by the "test.txt" filename. <br>  Press Enter.<br>  <br>  Hope that works for you...

IKXFAExJaa	Hubs, switches, and routers are all devices that let you connect one or more computers to other computers, networked devices, or to other networks. Each has two or more connectors called ports into which you plug in the cables to make the connection. Varying degrees of magic happen inside the device, and therein lies the difference. I often see the terms misused so let's clarify what each one really means.<br>  <br>  A hub is typically the least expensive, least intelligent, and least complicated of the three. Its job is very simple: anything that comes in one port is sent out to the others. That's it. Every computer connected to the hub "sees" everything that every other computer on the hub sees. The hub itself is blissfully ignorant of the data being transmitted. For years, simple hubs have been quick and easy ways to connect computers in small networks.<br>  <br>  A switch does essentially what a hub does but more efficiently. By paying attention to the traffic that comes across it, it can "learn" where particular addresses are. For example, if it sees traffic from machine A coming in on port 2, it now knows that machine A is connected to that port and that traffic to machine A needs to only be sent to that port and not any of the others. The net result of using a switch over a hub is that most of the network traffic only goes where it needs to rather than to every port. On busy networks this can make the network significantly faster.<br>  "Varying degrees of magic happen inside the device, and therein lies the difference."<br>  <br>  A router is the smartest and most complicated of the bunch. Routers come in all shapes and sizes from the small four-port broadband routers that are very popular right now to the large industrial strength devices that drive the internet itself. A simple way to think of a router is as a computer that can be programmed to understand, possibly manipulate, and route the data its being asked to handle. For example, broadband routers include the ability to "hide" computers behind a type of firewall which involves slightly modifying the packets of network traffic as they traverse the device. All routers include some kind of user interface for configuring how the router will treat traffic. The really large routers include the equivalent of a full-blown programming language to describe how they should operate as well as the ability to communicate with other routers to describe or determine the best way to get network traffic from point A to point B.

Sometimes if you change out hardware on your computer, it will think that you are trying to use a pirated copy.  Normally, it only complains if you make a major hardware change, such as a motherboard.  <br>  <br>  If your copy is legit, all that you need to do is call the Windows number and tell them what happened and they will guide you through it.  This process is lengthy, but it is the best solution.|`|qFHGv9uOaa	Check on top of your computer.( NOT YOUR SCREEN)  there is usually on top of that|`|1Nz4jgzZaa	Its probably not a legal copy, talk to the friend who put it on for you|`|SFjdd6WLaa	More than likely, your friend hooked you up with a pirated copy of Vista.  Unfortunately, it wasn't cracked correctly because it basically dialed home for verification,and was rejected as not being authentic.  I would backup all my files to cd or dvd, then fresh install Windows XP.  That's your legal option.  A little less than legal would be to download a Vista activation patch from the piratebay, and run that.  Personally, I'd take the next step forward and install Windows 7 (the beta can also be found on the piratebay).|`|LWCPI9Dgaa	It sounds like it could be an illegal copy.|`|AR0SDW2naa	I've read the answers previously given and have recently run into a similar problem trying to install a printer.<br>  <br>  I contacted the company that manufactured my printer, who told me to contact microsoft, who told me it wasn't their fault but rather the fault of the computer manufacturer.   Who states that it's not their fault but rather Microsofts.   Although everyone would be very happy to solve it for a fee.  <br>  <br>  Which is just a long way of saying that after some research i discovered that in fact many of the large computer companies will put a generic OEM product key on their computers which may or may not be valid for your computer.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I haven't had any.

wUqeZl3Saa	As far as I know, there is no "list". There are some suggestions though.<br>  <br>  You'll need a degree in computer science or a related field. You might want to take some extra classes that are security related and specialize in computer security. Then you can probably go to work for one of the companies that specialize in network security and forensics. Attend as many of the expensive seminars and classes on pen testing that you can get to. There are actually courses but none from any universities that I've found. Any certificates you get are a bonus. Even if you don't go into a security related job, they always love pieces of paper at the job interview. I usually prefer proof of ability not proof of passing a quiz.<br>  <br>  Some other ideas. Learn everything you can about Linux. Learn how to configure and mis-configure just about everything. You'll have a lot of similarities to other flavors of *nix. Do the same for just about every flavor of Windows since 2000. Learn how to exploit them. Learn how to test for and exploit configuration errors from outside.<br>  <br>  Collect a set of tools. Depending on the actual testing, you may need to put together your own set of tools or perhaps write your own to fill in any gaps. Some things as old as a war dialer are useful for pen testing in some situations.<br>  <br>  I've spent a lot of money on various books related to security, forensics, "hacking" and catching or studying "hackers". Often as not, I read about something online and then research leads me to a book or more information online. I picked up one book in the bookstore several years ago that discussed reverse engineering or "reversing". I flipped through the pages and found a discussion on getting around a technique that was in use almost 20 years prior to the book being published (in other words nothing new) and the author made it seem like this was a big deal. It was "normal" 20 years ago. The quality of the "hacking" authors vary widely.<br>  <br>  I do have to offer a caution for anything online. Some of the sites you may visit are so infected with crap that they are dangerous to experienced hackers.<br>  <br>  If you pick up the right book, you might even find one of my old FAQs that I wrote referenced with my real name.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf|`|cm4oW9lZaa	Security can be those Trojans and Viruses and removing them manually, or Security can be a little mixture of hacking, but with more ethical minds.<br>  <br>  I recommend you get backtrack, a great OS crunched with a lot of great tools. Download BackTrack here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.remote-exploit.org/backtrack_download.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.remote-exploit.org/backtrack_...</a><br>  <br>  Choose "CD Image", stick your CD in and use IMG burner and transfer it to your cd and reboot (with the cd inside cd-rom), but remember, this makes a totally new partition, meaning you won't be able to go back to Vista or XP, you will also need to install drivers, you can do this easily using wget and apt-get, you can also install a custom boot manager so you can control your booting and what OS you want to switch to whenever you reboot.<br>  <br>  So good luck with that.<br>  <br>  Now I recommend you get into some basic ARP poisoning, ARP is Address Resolution Protocol, we can poison this and get all the TCP packets and passwords switched back to our box.<br>  <br>  We can do this via Cain and Abel, download Cain and Abel here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oxid.it/cain.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxid.it/cain.html</a><br>  <br>  After installment follow these directions I made a while back for my friend:<br>  <br>  Now, if you have an XP, just click it normally, if you have Vista, run it as admin.<br>  <br>  After that, go to "Sniffer", and hosts. Hover over some of the icons on the top table. Press the one that says "Start/Stop sniffer", and then press the + sign to start the logging.<br>  <br>  Then, after that is finished, go to the ARP tab, and hover over the icons on the top table and press the one that highlights "Start/Stop sniffer", click that, then click the table where it says "Status, IP address, etc", then press the + sign, then press the yellow icon on top of the tables. And it should start poisoning.<br>  <br>  Now, to test it out, go try and login to your box through putty session, and it should save it on the passwords tab on the sniffer tab, any attempt what so ever will be recorded and stored in the Passwords tab.<br>  <br>  So directory is as follows: Sniffer >> Passwords  then you should see HTTP and stuff like that with raising numbers. Click on it and you'll get satisfying answers.<br>  <br>  This is another tutorial I made, this is DNS spoofing, it works for the following OS's:<br>  <br>  Backtrack<br>  Windows Vista (possibly)<br>  Windows XP<br>  and other Windows versions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pastie.org/402718" rel="nofollow">http://pastie.org/402718</a><br>  <br>  I made a lot more but lets keep it at minimum for now.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Try checking for info at <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackhat.com/</a>

JXYMtYFDaa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time.

Talk to someone geeky in your city to help, or talk to local computer stores, bigger and smaller. Unfortunately everyone doesn't know as much as you think, so talk to more people and you will come up with questions to sort out what works for you. Prices and availablility of strong signal important. Usually better cell phone carrier signal may help internet also. If you have a strong geek friend or programmer he or she could get you pointed right. More info at www.pcmag.com. In my town rates run $40 to $80 a month.

Once a file is there it will ALWAYS BE there!<br>  <br>  That said, there are programs that will overwrite a file, or even a whole hard drive, with either 1s or 0s or a combination of both for a certain number of passes. This does NOT render the file COMPLETELY irretrievable, but it can make it so hard for computer forensics software to find that that software must be extremely sophisticated and, therefore, extremely expensive as well.<br>  <br>  There are many programs that one can use to overwrite or "erase" files with. One such program is Eraser.

HD7L65fXaa	Packages you import in Java will be relative to your classpath.  Your classpath is a list of directories in which roots of package structures reside.  The JDK is one such package structure and the root directory for that is already known by the java compiler.  To add your own package structure roots, use the -classpath command-line argument to the java compiler (javac).<br>  <br>  Say you build a package structure in /Users/Stuart/Documents/Work/.  Say under that directory you have Utilities/easyGUI/ and some Java classes defined there.  Then you can compile Java code that uses those classes with:<br>  <br>  javac -classpath /Users/Stuart/Documents/Work/ *.java<br>  <br>  and import them with import statements relative to that package structure root:<br>  <br>  import Utilities.easyGUI.* ;  // for example<br>  <br>  By adding as many classpath entries as you need to build your system, you can have many different package structures from which to import class definitions.  This is a typical way that large Java systems are built, each file, package, or package structure has a known list of dependencies on other package structures, and the -classpath arguments for building that file, package, or package structure reflect those dependencies.

Information is split to many neurons and data is processed simultaneously.  Regular computer process is sequential, following step by step.  Neural networks are used in complex math calculations in statistics and for artificial intelligence.  Scientists are working on new technology called "fuzzy neurons" which will allow a more life like function.  This is because they will allow more than a simple "yes" or "no", but the computer will actually formulate a more human like response.  I'm sure there is a lot online about this topic, so you could learn much more from searching.  Hope this helps! : )|`|AA11050817	I think its basically a beowulf cluster. You take a ton of computers and distribute a bunch of different parts of one job, then those computers send the answer back to the computer that sent it out. I beleive the artificial neural network is what they are doing with ps3's, trying to computer dna or something. Look up cluster and that will tell you a little more about it.

sswefq49aa	its a pretty good setup and i personally like xfx plus you get farcry 2.<br>  but one of them is a superclocked edition so the choice is yours.|`|fCOq04lNaa	Looks good so far. As for the graphics solution, I'd recommend using a Radeon 4850, which is directly equivalent to a 9800GTX+. You can take out a combo deal with your processor to shave off $15.<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.160250" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealD...</a><br>  <br>  If you insist on a 9800GTX+ the 3rd EVGA one(<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130420)" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> has the highest clocks and is also the cheapest, so go for that one. EVGA is probably the best manufacturer for Nvidia cards because of their warranties and step-up program.The superclock should add a frame or two per second in a game.<br>  <br>  As for the power supply, it is adequate for a 4850 or 9800GTX+, but it has quite a bit of 1-star ratings, and Rosewill isn't a very well trusted PSU manufacturer. Choosing a good PSU is important, as bad PSUs will fry your parts. I'd recommend you pay $10 more for a 500W Antec, which has a better warranty and a much better reputation.<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371007&Tpk=Earthwatts%20500W" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>|`|ChBK5Lv9aa	Superclocked means that it runs faster, but you can clock it up that high yourself. But if you are looking for a 9800GTX+, this is your best option-<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130339" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  And your PSU should be able to run one of these cards.|`|53001d7ca31552cac3210dd20cb0bb18aa	That would be a pretty impressive setup for regular gaming, but I would add a few things:<br>  Make it an AMD Quad- a similarly clocked 9950 will run ~$145, but will give a huge performance boost over dual cores (went from 5.2 to 5.9 in Vista performance test, 5.9 is as high as Vista will test to)<br>  I would put 3 or 4GB of RAM in there- it gives you much more flexibility.  4GB is standard on many computers nowadays.<br>  I would get the 640GB WD drive- they actually load faster than the 500GB ones and cost maybe $5-$10 more.<br>  Hope it all works out, and if it does, you will be blown away with the performance!
TLWFQpv9aa	Yeah, friendster is hard to work with.  It doesn't have a cult following like myspace or friendster.  It isn't all that user friendly either.

IbxhRebgaa	No, don't bother. <br>  <br>  If you pay for 56Kbps dial-up, then 40Kbps is close enough. I know that when you're on dial-up, every kilobit per second counts, but you are getting a speed that's very close to your maximum speed. Even if you called them, they would probably just tell you that it's close enough and that there's nothing they can do for you.

HKkbqlIuaa	Firstly, the macbook and the macbook air are only different in appearance and weight. In fact, the Macbook has more memory and gigahertz, so it's actually better. I personally just bought my first Mac about a month ago. I absolutely love it. Here are some pros and cons.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  - It's an unfamiliar program, which takes a little getting used to<br>  - Common software for games and other applications are hard if not impossible to find<br>  <br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  <br>  - Much less likely to get a virus on your computer<br>  - Although the program is unfamiliar, once you get used to it, it's very easy to operate<br>  - The computer has a very fast processor; it's the fastest computer I've had<br>  - The warranty is GREAT. If you have any problems or questions, you can call them and they are SO helpful. If they don't know the answer, they will find someone who does.<br>  - Your Macbook comes with a photoshop program, a program to create movies, and something called garage band. <br>  - I would recommend purchasing the iWork software if you are going to be using it for school. It's great, and just as easy as the Microsoft programs<br>  - IF for some reason you were ever to have to have windows on your system, you can still do so that with a special parallel program<br>  - Although it seems insignificant, the trackpad is the best. Instead of it being complicated and difficult, they have simplified it so much. To scroll, you just use 2 fingers instead on 1. There are lots of easy little things you will learn once you use one. It also runs A LOT smoother than any other laptop I've used.<br>  <br>  <br>  I absolutely love my Mac. It's so much better than any PC that I've had or used. When I was debating back and forth between a Mac and a PC, the one thing that really sold me on it was going to the Apple store, where they have ones out that you can use and play around with.<br>  <br>  NOTE: If you go purchase one, have the salesman give you a tour of the Mac before you buy it. It helps a lot. Also, make sure you tell him you're a student so you can get a discount. <br>  <br>  Believe me, you won't regret getting a Macbook. I absolutely love the one I have, and I don't think I'll ever buy a PC again. Also, I have several friends who bought Macs before I did, and they now say the exact same thing.|`|a565008321f7d1c16239da2dad57529aaa	It really depends on what you will be doing with the computer. If you plan on doing a lot of video editing then go with the mac. Plan to spend about 2 times as much tho for a mac. You say you don't like pcs well if you would happen to buy a dell you could buy the complete care for it (if you run over it dell would replace it) Mac are less likely to get virus. I have about 60 Macbook white 13.1 widescreen for a school works great. The only down fall is that the 2008 version of office doesn't work, so you must use the 2004 version. So there are many advantages to both types of computers, it really just depends on what you are planning to do.|`|LAcEaLqEaa	I would suggest a dell. It is a very nice piece of work, and my dell is very nice also it isn't made by apple so that's a plus.

f42a3bd2401d35e0ae848a8227135c7baa	I think the question is: "Why do people say google is faster than Yahoo?  Is it faster because of their network or is it the way their system is set up?  What technology do these two search engines use?  How many servers do they each have?  What sort of servers do these two web searchers use?"<br>  <br>  I don't know all the answers.

These crawls do happen often, but it may take a few days, or weeks, for every page with your details to be updated. So if you search for your username, pages may still appear even if there is no reference to your username on the live page anymore.

Some laptops require the battery to be working and installed before they will turn on, (even though the charge light is on the battery could still be faulty).  If it is still under warranty take it back and get it repaired if not have a computer repair center look at your laptop (about ￡40) and test your battery. <br>  Good luck.|`|YqJGwV4taa	Power supply short. take it somewhere to have it looked at.

maMeeV4caa	I believe that you need to get a new charger that is specifically for your laptop.<br>  <br>  The new charger is making your computer laggy because it has 0.5 volts less than your old one. So the computer has to work that much harder to draw power from the charger, thereby making it laggy. It wont lag when you run off battery because the laptop draws power normally from the battery. If I am correct, you may also experience overheating with your laptop.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you return the charger to Dell and get a charger from Topmic.com because they offer lifetime warranty and free shipping for only $58. ($30 cheaper than Dell). and you dont have to worry about your charger breaking anymore.<br>  <a href="http://www.topmic.com/dell-inspiron-1721-laptop-charger-ac-adapter-power-supply-and-power-cord.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.topmic.com/dell-inspiron-1721...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck, get a new charger somewhere soon.|`|Fk3TupqVaa	There are several primary reasons could cause your computer to be slow and also some softwares you can download to speed up it.<br>  First,Corruption and Errors within your registry.The registry is a main part of your computer's Operating System.

lcyV3WHAaa	Some new netbooks do not have cd drives so this problem appears on occasions. <br>  <br>  the simple answer is, it can be done, but it is very complex. <br>  <br>  First, you need a BIOS that will boot from a usb flash drive, without that, it won't work at all. The alternative is to obtain an external disk drive to run the cd and install windows.<br>  <br>  then you need to turn your flash drive into a bootable drive that will launch the windows setup.<br>  <br>  -- (pasting from my source linked below) --<br>  <br>  For the most part, computers manufactured within the last two years are generally able to boot from a flash drive. Older systems may require a BIOS update, or might not be able to boot from a flash drive at all.<br>  <br>  Another catch is that not every flash drive will get the job done. The primary factors that limit your use of a particular flash drive are capacity and speed. Technically, speed isn't really a limiting factor, but booting Windows will be painfully slow unless you use a flash drive that supports USB 2.0.<br>  <br>  One of the requirements for creating our bootable USB flash drive is a Windows XP with Service Pack 2 installation CD. If your Windows XP installation CD doesn't already include Service Pack 2, then you will have to make a CD that includes Service Pack 2 through a technique called slipstreaming.<br>  <br>  In addition to your Windows XP installation CD, there are a couple of other things that you are going to need. For starters, you will need the HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool. You can download this tool for free. ( <a href="http://h18007.www1.hp.com/support/files/hpcpqdt/us/download/20306.html" rel="nofollow">http://h18007.www1.hp.com/support/files/...</a> )<br>  <br>  Another utility that you are going to need is Bart's Preinstalled Environment Bootable Live Windows CD / DVD, or BartPE for short. You can download this utility for free from the BartPE Web site. ( <a href="http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/</a> )<br>  <br>  you must format the flash drive by using the HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool that you downloaded earlier. To do so, simply open the utility, select the device followed by the FAT file system option and click Start.<br>  <br>  Once the device has been formatted, you must make it bootable. To do so, you must copy the BOOT.INI, NTLDR, and NTDETECT from the root directory of your PC's boot drive to the flash drive. These files are hidden by default, so you will either have to configure Windows Explorer to show hidden files (including protected operating system files) or you will have to open a Command Prompt window and use the COPY command to copy the files. <br>  <br>  If you choose to use the Windows Explorer method, then open Internet Explorer and enter C: into the address bar so that you are looking at your local hard drive. Next, select the Folder Options command from the Tools menu. When the Folder Options properties sheet opens, select the View tab. Now, just select the Show Hidden Files and Folders and deselect the Hide Extensions for Known File Types and the Hide Protected Operating System Files check boxes. Click OK to continue.<br>  <br>  Now that you have formatted your USB flash drive and installed the boot files onto it, the next thing that you must do is to configure your PC to allow you to boot from the flash drive. This is all done through the computer's BIOS Setup. I can't give you specific instructions for this part, because every computer is different.<br>  <br>  open PEBuilder and enter the path to the Windows installation files (the ones from your Windows XP with Service Pack 2 installation CD). Next, verify that the Create ISO Image and the Burn to CD check boxes are not selected and then click the Build button. PEBuilder will now create the new Windows build.<br>  <br>  Now, it's time to copy Windows to the flash drive. To do so, you will have to use a special batch file that's included with PEBuilder. Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to c:\pebuilder313\plugin\peinst. Now, insert an empty flash drive into the computer's USB port and then execute the file PEINST.CMD<br>  <br>  Type 1 and press [Enter] and you will be prompted to enter the path to the build that you have created. Enter C:\pebuilder313\BartPE. Now, type 2, press [Enter], and you will be prompted for the target path. Enter the drive letter that Windows has assigned to your USB flash drive. After doing so, the menu now displays the source path and the destination drive. Type 5 and press [Enter] to install Windows to the flash drive.<br>  <br>  Running Windows from a flash drive isn't an exact science. Sometimes the process just doesn't work and there is no good reason why. As more PCs start to support booting from USB devices though, USB boots should become more standardized, and the technique should become more reliable.|`|YVE64dJUaa	you're in a bit of bad luck there aren't you<br>  <br>  unfortunately for the most part you can't boot from USB devices and of course then you have the copyright protection on the windows disk<br>  <br>  so....<br>  <br>  get the disk drive fixed and install the conventional way

This is simply not true! There's three really good programs that are free to the public with no strings attached! Use these programs together and they make up the perfect security system that rivals any paid program. They don't slow your computer down like other programs.<br>  The first is M-bam "Malwarebytes"It's an on demand scanner with a really cool tool called file assassin.You can use this tool to delete rogue programs that freeze up your computer and keeps you from downloading and using security programs!<br>  The second is "Superantispyware" It's another on demand scanner that catches what M-bam misses!<br>  Third is "Avira" It's an on demand scanner and firewall "although they call it AntiVirGuard" I use this as my primary security.I have it setup to do updates and scans at night when I'm sleeping so when I go on my computer in the morning it's there waiting for me to review all the bugs I caught the day before!

You could experience system instability and crashes, or even complete freezes, without any lasting damage to the chip, but if the temperature gets too high, the chip could be damaged beyond repair.<br>  <br>  On occasions a cpu or gpu fan will slow down or seize up entirely.. this causes the temperature to rise steadily as it is not kept in balance.. it will reach a point where the system is no longer stable and will either shutdown or freeze.<br>  <br>  Should the heatsink get removed, a cpu can reach a very high temperature (400 degrees celsius and above in some cases) and will melt causing smoke and permanent damage to the cpu in a matter of a second.|`|D7jC0CNsaa	Generally when a graphics card overheats it causes your PC to crash.

If it did work, is this a new router? If no, what was the last thing you did, before the problem started. If yes (this is a new router), did you tried cloning the MAC address of your first computer when you first connected to the internet, because the modem registers the MAC address of the first computer used to connect to the internet for the first time? If not, try that. <br>  <br>  You could also reset the router, and configure as accordingly.<br>  <br>  Another way of making sure your router isn't the culprit would involve a second set of router handy, and try connecting the modem to the router.|`|dLFXJ3Esaa	While being disconnected from the router- was internet ok on your laptop?

Someone with the right software could still access those files. <br>  <br>  The only way to completely remove the files existence is to perform a low level format on the hard drive, which I do not recommend if you want to continue using your computer, or save something else to your hard drive that overwrites those sectors.

If you are going to get rid of a PC and want the hard drive to be clear of all your data, first get an erase magnet and this will polarize all the iron oxide chrystals on your drive.  It will take moving the erase magnet in a circular direction for several minutes on both sides of the hard drive.  Then, get the low level format utility for your particular brand of hard drive.  You will need to make sure that you boot from a bootable floppy and have the low level format utility on the same floppy, or boot to DOS from a Windows install  CD and then run the low level format utility from a separate floppy.  When you are finished, you can rest assured that all but highly trained specialists can recover anything from this type of erasure and reformatting.  Hope this helps!

AA10464818	"If you build it, they will come" is not necessarily true on the Web. Putting a website up is one thing, but getting visitors to come to your site is another. The process becomes even more difficult if you have limited resources to market your business.<br>  <br>  You can try pay per click programs such as Google Adwords <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/adwords</a> or Yahoo Search Marketing <a href="http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com">http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com</a> – though the key is to carefully track your ROI and which keywords actually perform well<br>  <br>  Here are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: <br>  <br>  1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.<br>  <br>  2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!<br>  <br>  Recommend Site Scripts (various) <a href="http://php.resourceindex.com/Complete_Scripts/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/" rel="nofollow">http://php.resourceindex.com/Complete_Sc...</a><br>  Big Nose Bird Recommend this Site <a href="http://bignosebird.com/carchive/birdcast.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://bignosebird.com/carchive/birdcast...</a> <br>  CGI Resource Index <a href="http://cgi.resourceindex.com/Programs_and_Scripts/Perl/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.resourceindex.com/Programs_an...</a><br>  Hostscripts <a href="http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/Site_Recommendation/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_an...</a><br>  <br>  3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.<br>  <br>  If you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day." <a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/201...</a> <br>  <br>  SEO for Google <a href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/google.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/googl...</a><br>  SEO for Yahoo! <a href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/yahoo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/yahoo...</a><br>  SEO for MSN <a href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/msn.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/msn.h...</a><br>  Tying It Together: SEO For The Big Three <a href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/SEO.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/SEO.h...</a><br>  <br>  4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html</a><br>  <a href="http://i-newswire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://i-newswire.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/add.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pr.com/press-releases" rel="nofollow">http://www.pr.com/press-releases</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prfree.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theopenpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theopenpress.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.przoom.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.przoom.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prweb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.prweb.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newswiretoday.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswiretoday.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.free-press-release.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-press-release.com/</a><br>  <br>  5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.<br>  <br>  Here is a comprehensive list of where to submit your articles <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AhzreGmnCUicOoyedqypscUjzKIX?qid=1006022407481">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=...</a><br>  <br>  6. Improve your conversion. Getting visitors is one thing; getting them to buy your products is a whole different story. Read the article "10 Ways to Convert Visitors to Buyers" <a href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/072005/conversion.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.powerhomebiz.com/072005/conve...</a> for tips on how to improve your conversion rates.<br>  <br>  7.

60fbc59cd9cb3a6b4c2ea1875eb1b0afaa	ADSL was started up as the Phone Company's way to compete with cable TV by delivering both TV and phone service on the plain old copper phone line. Of course now ADSL is also a good candidate for high speed Internet access. ADSL was originally designed so that it could still be used as a regular phone line if the power happened to go out.<br>  <br>  The "A" stands for "Asymmetric", meaning the Phone Company can send lots of data to the customer, but the customer can't send much to them at all. At the beginning only a tiny uplink of 16 or 64kbps was supported now ADSL can support up to ten times that much. The idea for ADSL was spawned by Joe Leichleder in 1987, he was a Bellcore researcher and the first idea for it was analog to digital conversion at the subscriber end of an advanced transmission technology over a twisted pair copper line. ADSL was designed to provide megabit access for interactive video (video on demand, video games, delayed TV segments, etc.) and high speed data communications (Internet access, remote LAN access, other network access) but it is also perfect for surfing the web.<br>  <br>  In the 1990s, vendors developing video-on-demand products started using ADSL technology, with different speeds for sending and receiving channels. Although the video idea didn't pan out, the Internet did and ADSL emerged as a hot product for residential Web surfing. The only thing missing was the telephone line, so frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) was added to ADSL to reserve a separate 4-kHz POTS (plain old telephone system) channel below the higher frequency data band. ADSL uses a single wire pair. Speeds on the receiving channel can climb to 6 Mbit/s, but actual performance depends on the condition of the line being used.<br>  <br>  There was a DSL Forum formed towards the end of 1994, and this was set up to help telephone companies and their suppliers realize the great market potential of ADSL. This forum has two forms of assistance which are technical and marketing. The Forum's marketing programs attempt to uncomplicate the technical complexity of it and to spread the news concerning ADSL. The output of the forum to the public mixes the tutorial with the promotion of this device.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  click here to see:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_Digital_Subscriber_Line" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_...</a>|`|1eed2d993e93a863fae804407f6e8920aa	The year 2003 is what I come up with.

The file is 1.212 MB in size, so it fits on an old fashioned 3 1/2 inch floppy diskette.  <br>  <br>  So if you are an author and write continuously, you could write approximately 33 million characters before you should be concerned with running out of disk space.

Unicode is another deal and im not getting in to it. So if you are writting a plain text file. One byte is one character. <br>  <br>  65 MB turns out being 68157440 bytes. So that many characters. You figure that out by taking 65 times 1024 to figure out how many kilobytes are in 65 MB. Then by 1024 again to find out how many bytes are in 65 MB. So you end up with 68,157,440 characters. <br>  <br>  In practice, less than that because this doesnt take into account file tables, and the data structure of whatever file type youre writing this into.

Microsoft will give you 30 days to register and if you dont then it will put a lock down on your system..|`|AA11097986	i think microsoft would frown upon that. windows ME and windows 2000 are not that great. they were rushed into production and ended up making a mess of everyone's computers. i'd upgrade to windows XP. if your computer has atleast a 500mhz processor in it, windows xp should work on your pc. if you are good with computers I'd look into using linux. ubuntu linux to be exact. its completely and legally free and can do most things xp can do. I guess though it depends on what gadgets your kids got for christmas and how much time you have to get used to using a new operating system

It can also be a software issue.<br>  <br>  If you installed any new hardware, check/reset the connections.<br>  <br>  The issue may be from your CPU overheating. The computer automatically reboots to prevent damage to the CPU, motherboard, and other components that would require a costly repair. The CPU may be overheating because the fan failed or is not functioning properly. Open your case and see if the CPU fan is obstructed. If there is a lot of dust, try using compressed air to clean the dust out. If the dust seems to be the problem, then your problem will be solved.

I removed the  fans and removed the label to expose the center shaft.  I put a few drops of oil and let it sit there for about an hour.  Then I put the label back on, installed the fans and they were very quiet.  You can remove the label carefully by heating it up with a hair dryer as you are prying the label up.  Or, buy new fans and install them.  Don't be cheap like me.

KHSOVxViaa	Encapsulation and separation.<br>  <br>  An interface is a way to use a separately created 'black box' class, where the user doesn't know or care what's inside.  All the user has to know is how to use the interface.<br>  <br>  Hence the creators of such 'black boxes' can keep secret their internal code, bundling inside everything that's needed for it to work.  This code will have no bearing on any of the user's code - they're separate.  It also means they can change this code, producing subsequent versions, without changing the interface.  To the end user, they don't use it any differently, just slotting in the replacement DLL without changing any code.<br>  <br>  It's a common way of using commercial DLLs, where the interface is provided but the user has no way of seeing the internals.<br>  <br>  Of course, you can write interfaces for your own code.  It's a useful way of creating independent components that can be maintained separately.|`|F6r6Qai8aa	I just read guanotwozeros answer. It's interesting stuff. But for me this is quite advanced for the average hobbyist programmer (who is the only person to ever read or use their code). <br>  <br>  I'm into java but I think what I have experienced also applies to C#.. For me the main use of interfaces is in creating types that can be applied to any number of classes. Each class that implements an interface also becomes of that interface type.. you can then do stuff like pass that interface type to a method (that receives the interface type as an argument) or allow a class to hold it as a member object. You can also do stuff like hold an array of interface types and iterate through them etc. I created this (in Java) that demonstrates how an interface can be used..<br>  <br>  <br>  import java.awt.GridLayout;<br>  import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;<br>  import java.awt.event.ActionListener;<br>  <br>  import javax.swing.JButton;<br>  import javax.swing.JFrame;<br>  import javax.swing.JPanel;<br>  <br>  <br>  public class TestSpeakingButtons extends JPanel{<br>  <br>  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;<br>  <br>  int numAnimals;<br>  <br>  public static void main(String[] args) {<br>  TestSpeakingButtons tsb = new TestSpeakingButtons();<br>  tsb.init();<br>  }<br>  <br>  void init() {<br>  this.createZoo();<br>  JFrame jf = new JFrame("Test Speaking Buttons");<br>  jf.setLayout(new GridLayout(1, this.numAnimals));<br>  jf.setDefaultCloseOperation(<br>  JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);<br>  jf.add(this);<br>  jf.setSize(100, 150);<br>  jf.setVisible(true);<br>  }<br>  <br>  void createZoo() {<br>  Speakable[] zoo = {<br>  new Cat(),<br>  new Dog(),<br>  new Cow()<br>  };<br>  <br>  this.numAnimals = zoo.length;<br>  <br>  for (int i = 0; i < numAnimals; i++) {<br>  this.add(new SpeakingButton(zoo[i]));<br>  }<br>  <br>  }<br>  }<br>  <br>  class SpeakingButton extends JButton implements ActionListener {<br>  <br>  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;<br>  Speakable sp;<br>  <br>  public SpeakingButton(Speakable speakable) {<br>  super(speakable.getName());<br>  this.sp = speakable;<br>  this.addActionListener(this);<br>  }<br>  <br>  @Override<br>  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0) {<br>  this.sp.speak();<br>  }<br>  }<br>  <br>  interface Speakable {<br>  <br>  void speak();<br>  <br>  String getName();<br>  <br>  }<br>  <br>  class Cow implements Speakable {<br>  <br>  @Override<br>  public void speak() {<br>  System.out.println("MOOOOOO!");<br>  }<br>  <br>  @Override<br>  public String getName() {<br>  return "Cow";<br>  }<br>  }<br>  <br>  class Dog implements Speakable {<br>  <br>  @Override<br>  public void speak() {<br>  System.out.println("Ruff!

CBk9KdHvaa	Wireless Internet can be delivered several ways using what we call the "air" interface.  The air interface connects the primary tower antenna to the handset or data receiver.<br>  <br>  Cellular companies use "aircards" to distribute wireless internet using "3G" EVDO, HSPDA, 802.16(WIMAX) and CDPD.  These are licensed technologies capable of delivering service for 3 to 5 miles.<br>  <br>  Other companies use licensed airways to send wireless internet using dedicated point to point antenna systems.  These are usually for special events or for customers in hard to reach locations.  These are licensed technologies capable of delivering service for distances up to 25 miles.<br>  <br>  <br>  Finally there is 802.11(WIFI)  (and in some locations 802.16 (WIMAX))  which is based on the 802 IEEE standard.  These are unlicensed applications.   802.11 WIFI in a hotspot application is usually for about 300 feet.   802.16 WIMAX and some exotic WIFI applications can be delivered reliably up to 25 miles. <br>  <br>  Hence WIFI is ONE delivery method of MANY for wireless internet services. <br>  <br>  <br>  LoneStar Computer Services<br>  3105 Ira E.

FjCcc561aa	OpenVPN with FreeBSD, PF and Windows<br>  <br>  This howto is a quick a dirty guide to building OpenVPN on a FreeBSD box (running pf as the firewall), and then connecting a Windows XP client to it. Server Install<br>  [edit] Install the port<br>  <br>  cd /usr/ports/security/openvpn<br>  make install<br>  <br>  [edit] Start setting stuff up<br>  <br>  First edit your /etc/rc.conf and add the following line:-<br>  <br>  openvpn_enable=”YES”<br>  <br>  Now create the config files, which we will place in /usr/local/etc/openvpn:-<br>  <br>  cd /usr/local/etc/<br>  mkdir openvpn<br>  cd openvpn<br>  <br>  vim openvpn.conf<br>  <br>  Place this into your config file:-<br>  <br>  # Specify device<br>  dev tun<br>  <br>  # Server and client IP and Pool<br>  server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0<br>  ifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt<br>  <br>  # Certificates for VPN Authentication<br>  ca /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/ca.crt<br>  cert /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/server.crt<br>  key /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/server.key<br>  dh /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/dh1024.pem<br>  <br>  # Routes to push to the client<br>  push "route 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0"<br>  <br>  # Use compression on the VPN link<br>  comp-lzo<br>  <br>  # Make the link more resistant to connection failures<br>  <br>  keepalive 10 60<br>  ping-timer-rem<br>  persist-tun<br>  persist-key<br>  <br>  # Run OpenVPN as a daemon and drop privileges to user/group nobody user nobody<br>  group nobody<br>  daemon<br>  <br>  [edit] Creating Certificates<br>  <br>  cp -r /usr/local/share/doc/openvpn/easy-rsa /home/myuser/ cd /home/myuser/easy-rsa<br>  <br>  Now edit the “vars” file to set your specific details and set the environment variables you have just created and build the Certificate Authority certificates:-<br>  <br>  NOTE: Very Important Step for FreeBSD/TCSH users<br>  <br>  FreeBSD ships with tcsh as its native shell, at the time of writing the following scripts do not work. To get around this you must drop down to a bourne shell. To do this just type the following at a prompt:-<br>  <br>  sh<br>  <br>  Now you can carry on with building the certificates, once you have built them you can exit back out to tcsh.<br>  <br>  . vars<br>  ./clean-all<br>  ./build-ca<br>  <br>  You will have to answer a few questions on the last step, once this has been done your CA certs will be created in the keys subdirectory.<br>  <br>  Generate certificate & key for server:-<br>  <br>  ./build-key-server server<br>  <br>  Again answer the questions and the certs will be placed in the keys subdirectory.<br>  <br>  Generate certificates & keys for 3 clients (each client will require their own certificates, if multiple clients log in with the same certs then they will be assigned the same ips and will kick each other off the network):-<br>  <br>  Generating client certificates is very similar to the previous step. You need to ensure that all your details are the same as for the CA, apart from the common name, which needs to be different for each client. For the sake of clarity this should relate to person who is assigned this vpn certificate. All of these details can be found in keys/server.crt for the server and keys/client*.crt for the client details.<br>  <br>  ./build-key client1<br>  ./build-key client2<br>  ./build-key client3<br>  <br>  Generate Diffie Hellman parameters<br>  <br>  Diffie Hellman parameters must be generated for the OpenVPN server:-<br>  <br>  ./build-dh<br>  <br>  Now copy the whole keys directory to /usr/local/etc/openvpn:-<br>  <br>  cp -r keys /usr/local/etc/openvpn/<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Logging<br>  <br>  Before starting OpenVPN I also moved the logging (which defaults to /var/log/messages). Edit syslog.conf:-<br>  <br>  vim /etc/syslog.conf<br>  <br>  Add the following entry:-<br>  <br>  !openvpn<br>  *.* /var/log/openvpn.log<br>  <br>  Create log file:-<br>  <br>  touch /var/log/openvpn.log<br>  <br>  Restart syslogd:-<br>  <br>  killall -HUP syslogd<br>  <br>  Now start OpenVPN:-<br>  <br>  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/openvpn.sh start<br>  <br>  Check /var/log/openvpn.log for errors, then check that the device has been created.

If you just want a computer to pay bill and play on the web, and for your teenager to do homework, a custom built computer could be better (and cheaper) for you as you dont get things you dont need.<br>  <br>  Here is what i would get:<br>  <br>  Dual core processor<br>  160 GB or more Hard Drive<br>  CD/DVD Drive<br>  2 GB RAM<br>  A Built in graphics card is OK (but if you will be playing games as well, a better graphics card is recommended. e.g GeForce 8600GT)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|MGPlYmkbaa	Go to BestBuy they are the ideal store for your questions and needs. Ask the sales clerk for a computer/laptop that's best suited to your needs.<br>  <br>  However all computers are ideal for your needs its just that most it depends on what you want t customize you computer for. If you are a gaming fan then your computers physical parts (hardware are going to be customized). In your case you want a laptop/desktop to do some admin work and cruising the web. The computers applications (Software) will be all that you need. <br>  <br>  Brand wise I trust HP computers. Im a PC fan and im not big on Macs.|`|bpQMLozyaa	Ok, so you don't need a top notch speed computer then. I suggest a HP Pavilion a6700z series. Its for everyday use.

For your purpose Core 2 Duo processor wud be good enuff.<br>  <br>  Going for a locally assembled machine is not a bad idea but for the after service. My guess is local machine will nt come with a warranty on the parts or service which is important but if you do go for it,  it will work out cheaper.|`|3ZguJZbWaa	I would go to a local computer store see what they can hook you up with, also if you can get a boot drive that only has the things need for your sons homework on it that would give you less lag for billing.|`|QGXNrDa3aa	I would say not to buy a laptop, because in my person experience. The touch pads getting annoying and stuck. Buy a dell, dell's are very good for price, and speed, they are very useful. I have one and its great!|`|ThEm8DCkaa	If all you need is to get on the internet and do homework any new computer will do just fine. It's best to go cheap because it will loose most of it's value in a few years when new technology comes out. One thing to keep in mind about low end computers is that they come bundled with a bunch of useless software that boggs them down and makes them slow. Just uninstall the programs you never use or upgrade the ram and they will work great.|`|3LjMWownaa	If you get a Dell you would always have the technical support if something goes wrong.  If you get a custom one, it would probably be better and cheaper than ordering a pre built PC from dell or any other place.  If there were problems you could take it back to the store I bet, and it might be easier to deal with them instead of tech support.
PIetEkueaa	First you have to upload the song that you want to put as background music on friendster to a file sharing site. In my case, I uploaded my music files to Yahoo!Geocities (you can activate this option on geocities even if you're not making a website). After that, go to friendster homa page and choose "Edit Profile," then click on "Customize" on selection tabs located on the upper part of the page, then scroll down, you will see "Add Media" with a blank message box below. Type this code: <embed name="RAOCXplayer" src="http://files.myopera.com/winterdawn... type="application/x-mplayer2" width="320" height="45" showcontrols="1" showstatusbar="0" autosize="false" loop="true" enablecontextmenu="0" displaysize="0" pluginspage="http://www.microsoft.com/Wi...<br>  <br>  but change the ""http://files.myopera.com/winterdawn/fi... " part to the site address where you originally uploaded the song. Then click save and refresh your profile page, then you should hear the song playing. Enjoy! ;)

Sometimes the sound or graphics card will cause this with a bad file or if the card is just bad.  Memory that has failed can also cause this.  Most people suggest taking out some memory, the cards one at a time, etc and see if this solves the problem.  A lot of people it seems also have this problem who are gamers.  Hope this helps.  You can also do a system repair by inserting the original OS disk and rebooting your computer and telling it to boot from the disk.  Good Luck!|`|AA11941449	the Driver IRQL not less or equal usually means some kind of memory problem (either faulty RAM or faulty sockets on the board).could also be a file problem or bad hardware giving you that error and not necessarily the memory.you could take out the memory sticks and try one see if that helps,if not then take that memory stick out and try the other and see.if you will email me the error code number it will start with like 0x0 and other numbers and letters after that and i can help you out further.it could be many issues giving that error i really need the number error code at the BSOD to tell you more.|`|2D4wNCAiaa	Could be a problem with device drivers, hardware or software.

dkpIjt5jaa	When you say supplier, do you mean "seller" OR "manufacturer" ?<br>  <br>  Look at my answer in your previous question, I don't think it is your card, the REAL weak link is your PSU as the original computer Power Supply Units are generally not meant for future upgrades ( they are VERY limited in power ).<br>  <br>  BUT if you want to make sure, have the card tested in another computer !<br>  <br>  First go to a friend and try it in his computer (provided it is powerful enough) or if you don't want to do that, go back to the seller (have him check your card in the shop) unless he gave you no guarantee at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  If it does not work there, it is the card but I still say your PSU is not powerful enough.<br>  <br>  It may also be the two causes at once, your GPU asked too much of your PSU and self destructed but I hope for you it is just your PSU showing weakness.<br>  <br>  Your last action should be to call the supplier (if he is not also the seller) and arrange for an exchange.|`|AygEpMMaaa	ur whole system should be under warranty for 1 year standard,so yes,they would replace it|`|mzryAIxmaa	What are you trying to ask?

trakqk7Eaa	You are absolutely right; Intel Macs can run Windows.<br>  <br>  But beware.  You must fork over the extra cash to buy the Windows operating system. There are a couple of options, too.  You can select to go the cheap route and use Apple's free Boot Camp software, which allows you to choose which OS you wish to use every time you boot your computer.  However, as previously mentioned, you can use Parallels to run Windows in a window. This will cost you around $70, though.<br>  <br>  My personal advice is that if you are planning on using Windows exclusively (in which case I feel sorry for you), you shouldn't even bother with the mac mini.  However, if you want to get a mac mini and use the mac operating system for everything except working with your zune, dump the zune on eBay, skip buying windows (and parallels) and just buy an iPod and save yourself the hassle.  Good luck with whatever you choose!|`|pq2gFwMSaa	do NOT get a mac mini. buy a refurbished powerbook or something, mac minis SUCK|`|acb1ca883a1a62de308aaba65e828999aa	Son, you are completely right!

AA10954273	The government has nothing to do with it.  Your ISP may monitor your usage and cut you off or report you if they feel you're abusing the network.  But mostly it's the MPAA, RIAA and other similar organizations.  They're the ones who file lawsuits and criminal charges.  They don't look for anything in particular - they reportedly set up honeypots with popular files, then log the IP of anyone who downloads it.  From there they contact the user's ISP, get the user's information and prepare to file a lawsuit.|`|Gj1FgVjGaa	Its rare for them to find out, I got busted once but that was only because I was playing downloaded music on internet radio, and they do an audit on Internet radio sites from time to time, if you are not a dj then don't worry abou it.

FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.<br>  There is nothing that important that you have to circumvent the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

AA10087486	My Toshiba has 802.11 b/g, and I've had one issue that's common with using the Wireless Zero Configuration service built into WinXP.  It's not a problem when you're surfing/e-mailing, but it'a headache for games/VoIP or anything else where you need a constant data feed.  WZC continuously searches for wireless networks, even if there's only one available.  This causes timeouts and/or disconnects. Fortunately, the internal adapter does not rely on WZC, so I can completely disable it and use the adapter's software instead.  My laptop didn't come with the software, but it's available from Intel's website, and I've had no problems.<br>  <br>  To my knowledge, the timeout/disconnect issue with WZC has still not been fixed in WinXP, and I have no idea if the same issue exists with Vista.|`|AA11192767	802.11 a i think is no longer used, and may have some incompatibility issues with some new systems.<br>  <br>  b is not as fast as g, and g is not as fast as wire... so if you can plug your computer it's the best option to transfer files within a local network, all of the above are perfectly good to suit and share an adsl internet connection.

You should see either the IP address or the hostname of the system that sent you the message.  Realize that this may be a central server, not the person that is a client to that mail service.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Person A sends mail through Server A to Person B.<br>  <br>  Person B receives a message and the header contains that the message came from Server A.<br>  <br>  <br>  You won't see the IP of Person A unless the mail server includes it in the header.<br>  <br>  So:<br>  <br>  1) You will see the Hotmail email server address<br>  2) Social site pages are not associated with a users IP address so you'd need to get that directly from the user or if the social site allows searching by name, you may be able to get the page from that resource.  Permission to access the page may be restricted by the service though (i.e. that user may need to "allow" you to access the page).  I'm not a Bebo user so not entirely sure.  As for the "online/offline" status of the user, you would only know that if Bebo provides that information (either by having that user associated with your Bebo account or by some public interface they provide).<br>  3) Again, the Bebo address of a message will be the mail server, not the person who sent it.

As for tracking the location, you can use other features on WhoIs to get the owner (in this case Google) and an address (not the physical address of the server, but the registration address.

qBzvCetIaa	The only thing that  makes sense to me is that your Power Supply is too weak to handle a second hard drive. So your graphic card isn't getting enough voltage. Check the power rating of the hard drive and compare to the output of your PSU|`|ULw1777caa	That makes no sense.|`|t5sYXwSqaa	How have you installed the second hard drive, Have you pig back it to the first hard drive or have you connected it to a second IDE socket. Have you got the IDE cable in the right way round (Normally the coloured section of the IDE lead goes to pin 1) Have you made sure the pin at the back of the second drive is set to slave. If you have checked all this an it is correct and the graphics card is still failing, disconnect the power supply to the second drive and see if the graphic now works on start up. If it does then the power PSU is unable to deliver enough watts and will need to be replaced. Hope this helps. card now works|`|IFtV7g2Zaa	Several possibilites.<br>  <br>  1) Check the jumpers on your hard drives and CD ROM/DVD drive(s).  With IDE you can have up to 2 devices on each of 2 connectors on the mother board (total of 4).  For each connector, one must be master and one must be slave.  You can set the jumpers for "cable select" so that their order on the IDE cable determines which is master and which is slave, or you can specify manually which is which.  If the jumpers are set wrong, strange and screwy things will happen when you try to boot.  Everything from memory errors to a system that simply won't boot can happen.<br>  <br>  2) The power supply may be to small to handle the load.  In today's computers, many graphics cards require a ton of power.  The computer I'm typing this on, came with a 250 watt power supply, but when I upgraded the video card, I had to upgrade the power supply to a 400 watt power supply.  Its possible that the combination of the new hard drive and your existing power requirements is now too much so the most power hungry device...the graphics card.... suffers the most.<br>  <br>  3) It is extremely important that when working on computers, you NEVER get a static shock off any component inside of the computer's case.  Doing so can fry anything and everything inside the case.  You might have fried the IDE port that the second hard drive is connect to, for example.|`|MhySf1guaa	Id just get a new power supply, or id get an external hardrive like a mybook or something|`|AA11250547	does your 2nd hd work by its self?
BChKHLRXaa	OGRE is a graphics engine only, but is not an all inclusive package for game development.  You might try DarkGDK. Check it out at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://gdk.thegamecreators.com/" rel="nofollow">http://gdk.thegamecreators.com/</a><br>  <br>  DarkGDK is a set of easy to use libraries that basically make using DirectX a snap.  It basically takes the complicated world of DirectX and accesses it through easy to use, intuitive commands.  It is quite simple to learn as long as you have a basic C++ understanding.  The first time I used DarkGDK I had taken two simple classes on C++, but I had never even looked into game programming before. I found it really easy to learn, mostly by looking at the code of the example programs that are provided.<br>  <br>  DarkGDK is meant to be used with Visual C++ Express 2008. Before you install DarkGDK you need VC++ Express 2008 installed on your system.  I was previously using Visual Studio Professional, and did not have luck with integrating DarkGDK. The good news though is that even if you have some other version of Visual Studio installed currently, you can install VC++ Express 2008 without affecting your current installation of Visual Studio.  You can download it for free at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/</a><br>  <br>  You can Download DarkGDK for free from here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/samples/gamecreators/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/express/samples...</a><br>  <br>  The one thing that may or may not be a consideration for you is that DarkGDK games can only run in Windows, and are not compatible with any other OS.  But if you are just programming for the fun of it, that doesn't really matter.|`|6qimEUioaa	Typically there really is no software that can make a game letting you use C++.  I dont know there may be, I'm not into game programming.  However typically you code C++ logic to invoke methods of a graphics engine's API.  Since your asking this question, I'm assuming you know some C++.  An API is a list of classes, functions, etc, that allow a program to communicate with some other piece of hardware or software, i.e. the video card in this case.  A simple explanation of this could be an API that creates shapes on a screen.<br>  <br>  color = FF0000;<br>  int size = 5;<br>  //declare the shape<br>  SHAPE blah(color, size);<br>  <br>  blah.draw();//draw the shape to the screen<br>  <br>  Of course this all just bs code.  However it's the general way a game is built.  Representing objects using C++ and passing values to an API that controls the video card, etc.  Hope this helps!|`|R91sXoW6aa	which type of games are you thinking? board games? I guess not.

Nothing much you can do except maybe try and find another uploader with a higher seed ratio.|`|ULw1777caa	It all depends who you connect to.|`|oqQVRvqvaa	Okay, the speed of the torrents all depends on what ports you have forwarded and how many people are seeding the torrent, to check this, go to utorrent and click on preferences. Go to the connection tab, where you see the "listening port" section, it will display the port you are connected through, note that port down then open up cmd, type "ipconfig /all" and look at the default gateway. Type that into your internet browser (ex. <a href="http://192.168.0.1)," rel="nofollow">http://192.168.0.1),</a> if you are on a netgear router, type the username and password, which is normally "admin, admin" or "admin, password"<br>  <br>  Once logged in, click on services, add service, paste the port into the box and click accept.<br>  Now go to firewall rules, and add a rule to the outgoing ports, from the dropdown menu, select the service you created, and in the ip address, type in the ip address of your computer (normally 192.168.0.3 by default).<br>  <br>  Click accept, now try downloading the torrent again.|`|njkxZGz6aa	i don't really know why but it goes realllllllyyyyyy slow for me too. it takes like 5 or 6 days to download something on my computer...its really annoying!|`|VQqsJgWaaa	Maybe your ISP doesn't allow you to use it at full speed.Make a test here <a href="http://broadband.mpi-sws.org/transparency/bttest.php?" rel="nofollow">http://broadband.mpi-sws.org/transparenc...</a>|`|bpQMLozyaa	There may be not enough seeds.

Lower the system processes run-> msconfig<br>  <br>  Having start up programs that you dont need and others running in the back ground for no reason, eats up system resources.  When your laptop boots up with XP you should only have about 24-30 processes running.<br>  <br>  Also, your ram matters.  I know you said with no cost, but windows update updates a lot of things including processes.  A minimum of 2 gigs on any computer these days will make it speedy and fast.<br>  <br>  If your HDD is full that will also slow your PC down... but it tells you..|`|G2I9spZ7aa	Un-install unused program<br>  Clean ur desktop as little as u can because it affects the RAM<br>  Upgrades ur RAM<br>  Do defragmenting every week<br>  install antivirus and anti spyware|`|svsWJI1Xaa	The simplest answer would be buying a faster computer; however, there are some things that you could be done to make your computer faster:<br>  1. Laptops are slower than desktops with the same specific ions, because laptop components consume a lot of laptop components.<br>  2. Remove unnecessary programs.<br>  3. Remove unnecessary start up programs.<br>  Run regedit<br>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/...<br>  Or<br>  Run msconfig<br>  If you have doubts about a file, just search it on the internet. You should be able to get information about it.<br>  4. It is necessary to keep your computer clean from viruses, adware and spyware. Also, you should limit your internet browsing for the web sites that you trust.<br>  5. Never use or download those free scan programs. They create secure tunnels for viruses, adware and spyware in the computer firewall, so nothing can be detected. Also, they could change the registry values of your operating system meaning damage to your operating system components and making your computer unsecure.<br>  6. You could get a notable speed increase if the display resources are disabled (You should notice huge speed increase ).<br>  Control panel/System/Advanced System Settings/Performance Settings<br>  Choose ‘adjust for best performance’.<br>  7. Antivirus programs notably slow down the computers. It’d be better to get an effective antivirus program which doesn’t use huge computer resources.<br>  8. Use Disk Tools (Disk Clean up & Defragment) from time to time to improve reaching speed of your hard drive.<br>  9. You may temporarily end some processes and services from Task Manager; however, I’d not recommend doing it unless you are an expert.<br>  10. Finally, it might be necessary to reformat your computer if a notable slow down occurs and cannot be fixed by the above. Viruses and programs leave traces on the computer even if they have been removed.

AA10464818	Getting traffic is a combination of a lot of things. The key to success is to create great content that visitors want to use, search engines will love and other websites will naturally link to. Of course, it's easier said than done.<br>  <br>  You can use pay per click advertising in the search engines to reach audiences looking for your products. You can use Google Adwords <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/adwords</a> or Yahoo <a href="http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com">http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com</a><br>  <br>  Here are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: <br>  <br>  1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.<br>  <br>  2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!<br>  <br>  Recommend Site Scripts (various) <a href="http://php.resourceindex.com/Complete_Scripts/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/" rel="nofollow">http://php.resourceindex.com/Complete_Sc...</a><br>  Big Nose Bird Recommend this Site <a href="http://bignosebird.com/carchive/birdcast.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://bignosebird.com/carchive/birdcast...</a> <br>  CGI Resource Index <a href="http://cgi.resourceindex.com/Programs_and_Scripts/Perl/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.resourceindex.com/Programs_an...</a><br>  Hostscripts <a href="http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/Site_Recommendation/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_an...</a><br>  <br>  3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.<br>  <br>  If you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day." <a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/201...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html</a><br>  <a href="http://i-newswire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://i-newswire.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/add.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pr.com/press-releases" rel="nofollow">http://www.pr.com/press-releases</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prfree.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theopenpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theopenpress.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.przoom.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.przoom.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prweb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.prweb.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newswiretoday.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswiretoday.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.free-press-release.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-press-release.com/</a><br>  <br>  5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.<br>  <br>  Here is a comprehensive list of where to submit your articles <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AhzreGmnCUicOoyedqypscUjzKIX?qid=1006022407481">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=...</a><br>  <br>  6. Post a link to your site for free where it is allowed (always read the Terms of Use). Examples are:<br>  <br>  Craigslist <a href="http://www.craigslist.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.craigslist.com</a><br>  Google Base <a href="http://base.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://base.google.com</a><br>  Classifieds for Free <a href="http://www.classifiedsforfree.com/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.classifiedsforfree.com/...</a><br>  Text Link Exchange <a href="http://www.txtswap.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.txtswap.com/</a><br>  Recycler.com <a href="http://www.recycler.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.recycler.com/</a><br>  Yahoo Classifieds <a href="http://classifieds.yahoo.com/">http://classifieds.yahoo.com/</a><br>  US Free Ads <a href="http://www.usfreeads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.usfreeads.com/</a>|`|EmnIpVcJaa	Advertise on Craigslist, Social networking websites and post on relevant forums.

Consequently, the main F# libraries are the .NET libraries themselves (e.g. DirectX, Windows Forms, and ASP.NET, as well as alternatives like Gtk#).
