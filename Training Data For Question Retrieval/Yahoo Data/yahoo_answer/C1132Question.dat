I got a tattoo on my foot about a month ago. it's a star about the size of a quarter with small music notes around it.   I know it takes longer for foot tattoos to heal. I followed the directions for washing it, etc. but b/c it's winter i've worned shoes a lot.     it looks like there are a lot of spots that need touching up on the star.   but i can't tell. the rest of the star looks fine and it's raised up, but the spots aren't raised. and they look like they have less color. when i tried to scratch at it to see if it just needed to peel it was still a little sore.    does that mean those little places are healing still and they don't have as much color b/c they will peel later?   i have been applying lotion. it said on the sheet to do that after it was done peeling. it looked like it was done, but i wasn't sure.  could the lotion have made the spots that didn't peel loose their color?      i can get a free touch up, up to 3 months after (so till around mid april).   so that doesn't worry me (except knowing how bad it will hurt this time and not being able to run for a few weeks- again)      sooo.... any tattoo artists- or people who know a lot about tattoos...   should i stop with the lotion, in case it needs to peel more or should i keep doing the lotion?  and do you think it looks funky b/c it's still healing?

Anyway there was this fat lady with her husband and they started making fun of his nose even though he was obviousaly cute. He looked like a kid, maybe 18 or so and I think he heard it because he immediately left with a sad look on his face. Why does a fat lady have any right to make fun of how anyone looks? She was horrible too, like a 3.5/10 and the guy she was making fun of was like a 8.5. Does anyone have the right to openly make fun of someone?

So they stopped working. i went back to the dr, and she prescribed Differin. i thought this would work, but its been a month and my skin has gotten a million times worse. i HATE having acne, its really really really gross to me and i feel very ugly. so, what system has worked for your acne? i'm thinking of asking my mom to order ClearPores, but i dont know if it will be another failed system. i DO NOT want accutane, so thats not an option either.         oh, and ive tried a bunch of over-the-counter creams and whatnot in between these treatments, NONE of them work.

20070602174926AAPCT9t	Beauty & Style;Hair	Do women like beards on men?	I'm just wondering if most women out there prefer the clean-shaven look or men with a little hair on their faces. I used to be clean-shaven myself until a female friend convinced me to grow a goatee. I have had a goatee for a over a year and it includes a mustache as well. She said it looked really good on me and made me look more manly. I also keep my hair cut short so I look cleaner. But what do women today think of men with beards? Turn-on or turn-off?
