Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.     Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfed.com/ (RawFed)  http://www.rawlearning.com/ (Jane Anderson's Raw Learning Site)  http://rawfeddogs.net/ (Raw Fed Dogs)  http://www.rawmeatybones.com/ (Raw Meaty Bones)  http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs. BARF Diet)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths About Raw Feeding)    Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to canine obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times based on the feeding instructions on your dog's food.    More on dog food:  http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...

n4pNNcGfaa	Greenies are no more dangerous than any other chew treat, so long as you follow the instructions on the package.  Feed the size appropriate for your dog and supervise your dog while she's eating them.  If she bites off large chunks, stop giving her Greenies.    There was a big stink about Greenies being dangerous a couple of years ago.  The problem wasn't that they were any more dangerous than other chewies, but that they were the most popular brand and so it made for sensational news.  Every one of the reported cases I read was a case of the owner not following the package instructions.    At the time I had a very sick puppy who had to see a veterinary dental specialist.  I took the opportunity to ask this specialist, a world renowned expert, about Greenies.  He said they were great, that they were effective in cleaning the teeth and perfectly safe if fed correctly.    I continue to feed Greenies to all of my dogs (have fed 'em since they first appeared on the market), without a problem.  But I do supervise them as instructed.    ---edit---    The pigment in Greenies is chlorophyll, ie the same pigment that makes plants green.  Chlorophyll is a natural odor reducer.  I feed it in a much more concentrated form than Greenies to females in season to make them somewhat less attractive to males.  It is perfectly safe to feed dogs.    The problem wasn't the shape, which hasn't been changed anyway.    The problem wasn't indigestibility (they always were digestible) but that a few dogs were biting off large chunks without chewing and swallowing them whole.  The big chunks would upset the stomach or even block the digestive tract.  This was owner error for not supervising the dog's chewing.    The company reformulated them to make them softer so they would dissolve better in case the dog didn't chew.  There is a difference between being digestible and being dissolveable.  Someone went on about how a Greenie went through the wash and didn't disappear.  Well a steak wouldn't melt in the wash either, but if you chew it up properly it will pass right through and be fully digestible, the same as a Greenie.|`|wDmNpO8Gaa	There are different opinions regarding greenies.  Some people say that the pigment in greenies is not beneficial from dogs.  If eaten in abundance dogs get sick and can't digest them and will get constipated.    My dog loves them.  He's 8 years old and 16 pound heavy.  I give him one teenie a day and he's happy.  He's not had any digestive issues.    IMHO, greenies should be given to a dog as indicated in the bag.  If abused, then dogs will have problems.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	Trader joe's makes green digestible treats like greenie's but r all organic and won't make your dog sick.They are much bigger than greenie's and so much cheaper. My dogs love them and it helps with their digestion.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	There was a problem a couple of years ago with the shape of them.  Dogs could swallow them too easily & were getting them caught in their throat & choking.  They changed the design a good while back - about 2yr ago so yours are safe but as with any treat/bone you always keep an eye on your dog.|`|s23w0I3Baa	i haven't heard of them being recalled or causing some dogs to get sick. if you saw an article about it maybe do some more of your own research online about it. or you could always call your vet or local pet store and ask if they know anything about it.|`|AA12322387	The thing about Greenies is they aren't digestible...just like rawhides.  I started giving them to my terrier about a year ago and noticed he started throwing up...finally a piece of Greenie came up..    I took him to the vet and I was shocked that the first thing they asked me was if I had given him Greenies.  They said that the emergency animal clinic nearby sees about 3 dogs a month because of the treats.    I immediately stopped giving them to my dog and told everyone that I knew.    Many owners give their dogs these treats and similar treats (bones, rawhides, etc) and never have an issue.  Me?  I'm not willing to take a chance with my pets health.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Greenies are bad as are rawhides.     And you feeling bad about not giving them too her leads her to not see you as a leader. Emotion means follower in a dogs mind, not leader so stop babying her, she is a dog that needs a good leader.     As for treats, go for things like bully sticks, marrow bones, and antlers.     Treats that are good tend to follow good brands of dog food:   Evo, innova, solid gold, wellness, etc.   Here is a good site for dog food that you can follow for treats:   www.dogfoodanalysis.com  and www.dogfoodproject.com can help you with figuring out what to avoid.|`|OFpl236faa	They can't be digested so then they have the potential of getting stuck and then your dog has to have surgery to remove them. Sometimes the dogs don't chew them enough and then the pieces are too big to pass. I would try Nylabones. Those things last forever and our dogs are hard chewers. They have different sizes and differences in how hard they are.
z01moLIvaa	I'm geussing you don't actually mean 1' because ' is foot not inch. 1" spacing is okay for some big male rats and larger females. Females are generally much smaller than males so the recommended bar spacing for them is 1/2" which is harder to find in large cages like ferret cages. Here's a new one that is based off of the Ferret Nation- http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js... It's Midwest's Critter Nation and it's made especially for rats with 1/2" horizontal bar spacing. I have the single unit for 3 of my girls :)  Good luck! and remember that anything a rat can fit their head through, they can fit their whole body through.|`|nMuDw3Nzaa	rats are very good escapers! a baby rat could easily get through that, but big adult males might have trouble.  Be care ful though. Test your rats in the cage and if they can get out, do it the hard way like me.  I got them a big dog cage, but the spaces were too big so i had to use wire mesh on it. took forever, but they have a huge home and they can easily climb on the cage.    good luck! rats are awesome.    PS Babies are fun and really cute to have, but adults may be easier to take care of and a bit quieter, but remember never to get a boy and a girl, thoiugh you probably already know that.  they can mate between bars in a cage and in a month youd have 15 babies!  i have a big rat and two babies, and they are awesome!|`|TTs6GBBUaa	1' or smaller will be fine for adult rats. Just make sure that you get a big enough cage no matter what spacing it has.|`|40IUKsC2aa	that will be fine.just make sure that your rats have enough room to walk and play in.

Although there are many that would argue with this, my first responce would be a Pit Bull. They really are sweet dogs, even ones that are from shelters. As a shelter volunteer, I know from experience, having been bitten numerous times by Pomeranians, Labs, Beagles, and a few others.     If he's dead-set against a Pit Bull, I'd also recommend Bull Terriers. I've never had one myself, but I've met many at the local off-leash dog park, all of who've been very sweet and well-behaved.     Really, any of the so-called "Bully breeds" would fit that description. Before adopting though, I'd highly recommend doing thorough, in-depth research about the breed or breeds he's interested in.    EDIT: All in all, temperment is influenced by how the specific dog was raised. Although the dog's pasts aren't always apparent. I've met many a dog who's been badly abused, although once at the shelter, they've done complete 180's.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I have to go with American Pit Bull Terrier.  They are incredible dogs.

t85b6QMiaa	Both Convict Cihclids and Firemouth Cihclids are territorial. While Convict is a strict territorial cihclid, the Firemouth can be relatively peaceful towards the other species out of the breeding season. However, both of them still can tolerate being with larger fish.    The angelfish, even though they seem very volatile can also be a very aggressive neighbor. This can be observe when they are placed with smaller fish in their tank.    If you are only able to keep them in that 30G tank, I'd suggest not to include the angel fish. They are quite small when you first purchase it (even though they can grow considerably).    Even though with only the cichlids, they can still be very attractive. A very close friend of mine decorate his tank with dead reef, mimicking a marine aquarium and fill them with various cichlids. The result? A cool freshwater marine aquarium which is easiser to take care of.|`|yZAcwN3haa	well if not soon,then later on the convicts or firemouths will kill your angels.Territory comes into play especially if you have a 30 gallon tank.      Dr.Lung|`|QikvnTnqaa	I recogmend at least two of each kinda fish. Your first "set" sounds the best. I would lookup to see if angel fish can get along with cichlids.

Also, try a glass scraper if its like hard stains or try using some 409 cleaner or some KaBoom cause that stuff really works.
WbyFUQJbaa	I think any cat could be trained.  That is, if you are willing to clean up accidents.  I have heard that all you need to do it to put a litter box on the toilet seat.  Then after a few weeks of the cat being comfortable, you somehow put the litter box further and further INTO the toilet.  After awhile, no box needed.  I can't say it's the best way, but I've known people that did it, and it worked.|`|VydpAsYdaa	there are many videos on utube of people showing their cat using the loo!! strange but true|`|jpmDjFNeaa	I only saw that in Meet the Focker! I didnt think it was true. But their toilet had a button which was easier for her to push. Im just glad that they atleast go to the bathroom in their litter box instead of all over the house!|`|3FOmoaUZaa	Yeah, but I bet it's kinda hard. U would have to put the litter box next to the toilet at first. Then slowly rise the height of the box every few days (using books or something sturdy) until it reaches the seat level. Then u would put the box on top of the seat for a few days. U would have to get a toilet kit- a bowl that hangs in the toilet to put litter in. Finally, u remove the bowl. It would take a few weeks.   The hard part would b training the cat not to drink from the toilet!  If u had 2 toilets in ur house, it would b easier b/c u wouldn't have to remove the toilet litter when u used it.|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	Wow.    Not me.    But WOW.
oMINgkuiaa	i have a 55 gallon with a few mbuna at the moment. each fish are around 4-4.5 and i have a 5 inch pleco with them. they dont bother the pleco. when my 5 inch male auratus was there though he wouldnt stop attacking him. just watch out for the first few weeks of him in there. really depends on the temperment of ur fish. but for me it worked out.|`|yZAcwN3haa	Yes,they can.Make sure the pleco is about 3" or bigger.They have great armmor defense around there bodies.|`|9kceDOTraa	Mbuna are herbivores and substrate dwellers.  Aggression that people note, are not accounting for many factors.  Tank size being too small in many cases cause higher aggression in fish like this.  Right sized tank, usually something like a pleco is rarely an issue.  In the 20 gallon you mentioned you now have, probably would be a problem.  You really can't keep a common pleco in a 20, for the reason that common plecos eventually reach around 24 inches in size, and too big for a tank like that.    Last time you mentioned you had a Kenyi and Demasoni.  What are the other 2 you went out and just recently got?  Did you cycle out that 20 btw?  That's going to become and issue soon.    In a 20 I wouldn't go with even smaller plecos.  The problem is that it's not enough footprint.   You may want to consider some smaller botia's or loaches though.  They are usually more active, and a pleco really cranks out a high amount of waste, usually more then they are worth in my opinion.  Plus, a pleco isn't a true algae eater in case you didn't know.  It's an armored catfish and a bottom feeder.|`|BSzEkKhRaa	i would not recomend a regular pleco they are defenseles i keep african cichlids and o ne time when i got home my fish wre eating my foot /long plecos eyes out. so if you want a ny kind of  pleco go with the bristle nose pleco because they have a defense mechnism if any thing trys to disturb them they have needle sharp bones that pop out  right under there eyes.
Ik6WOcw3aa	They are nocturnal fish anyways. Try dropping some food in there after you turn the lights off. I just purchased two small 3 inchers and they only pick at their food during the day. Then at night they start moving around on the bottom and find their shrimp pellets.    And from what Ive seen, most small birchirs will only eat from the bottom. Ive seen some larger birchirs take from the top though.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	other fish?    WTF are you talking about?    senegals are "super predators" that will kill and eat just about anything, even angelfish 125% larger thank themselves      you're crazy for keeping them together
fwkxK2cCaa	First off, why would you want to moisturize your hen's legs which are called the shanks?  The shanks naturally looses the glossy and lustrous look as a chicken age especially, one as old as your hen.  The scales on the shanks will also be more defined but not always.  They will also be more proned to mites which burrows under the scales and gives it the ugly appearance of very rough raised scales and dry legs; Is this what you may also be talking about?  If it is, what I do is get a half a gallon of kerosene and mix it with a cup of linseed oil in a one gallon bucket; Submerge (dip) the legs completely in the already mixed treatment at least once a day for a week than gradually once every other day on the second week or until the shanks are back to their normal appearance, whichever comes first.    **Now, when you dip the legs leave it in there for approximately 10-20 seconds, as this will give the liquid treatment enough time to soak into and under the scales to kill off as many mites as it comes into contact with.  If you ask me why the linseed oil?  I like to think that if you only use full concentrated kerosene and not mix it with the linseed oil, it may dry up your chicken legs too much.  So, it sort of serve as a moisturizer and the kerosene would really be the agent that kills the leg mites.      **And if the mites are not the problem and your chicken legs just look like they are in need of some type of moisturizer to give them the nice, smooth appearance than I would suggest you use vasoline and gently rub them into the scales and anywhere else that your pet hen may need it.  (Once every few days is good or until you notice a change)    **btw, it does seem like you really do love that pet hen of yours for it to live that long and for you to seek out advices here on Y!A.  Hey, that's what we are here for;  To help each other and share our experiences.....lol    **Good-luck and I hope that the info above was of some help.   :)
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Yes - they're quite the little monkeys once the get the hang of the tubes!  I've had lots of very young dwarfs who have figured out the tubes pretty fast.  Some will catch on faster, but they'll all figure it out :)  I can't give you an exact "when" but don't worry, they'll all get used to them :)    If they can't get up the tubes immediately, don't worry if you see them climbing the bars (if your cage has bars) as they're smart and very nimble :)    The little one will catch on by watching the slightly bigger ones - but she'll get it :)    Good luck - and please feel free to msg me if you need any help!    Daisy|`|OhpbLfdraa	they re to small to climb they start climbing when they start growing and every hamster grows differently some grow a lot and some don't grow at all it also depends on how long the tubes are because some hamsters are 2 small and are not able to climb a tube or get to the second floor of their cage....good luck|`|CPX0pWbUaa	probally

If the hunger strike continues into 6-7 months then a trip to the vet may be in order where they may decide to force feed her. As long as it's weight loss isnt dramatic, then no worries. One of mine is now entering into her 3rd month without food. I fully expect it to be March before she decided to eat again.|`|WbyFUQJbaa	Snakes naturally don't want to eat around shedding time.  If they eat something large, their skin isn't elastic enough to stretch, and I've heard it can make them uncomfortable.  Don't worry about your little guy, I'm sure he's fine!|`|CSvsqkA5aa	Hi,  snakes generally wont eat around their pre slough time as they need to preserve all their energy for when it is time to shed. snakes can go months without food so don't worry too much. try again a day of 2 after it sheds and it'll probably eat, no worries.

Xv7p7nRKaa	There isnt really anything to worry about at the moment, he is just getting used to his new home, so give him a week or so to settle in and you should see a difference. Keep offering the crickets to him a few times a day because he might eat a couple.  Bearded dragons dont tend to drink water like us, they mostly obtain their water through the food they eat (crickets and vegetables) but i would keep a bowl of water in there for them as every now and then they like to have a dip to cool themselves down etc.    if he still hasnt eaten a thing this time next week, i would speak to the person where you bought him from as it could be a sign of ill health.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Don't start to worry yet. He is most likely a bit stressed out with the move to your home as well as the move to his new home. Forget the meal worms, not good for bearded dragons. If he is a baby go with crickets and remember if he is a baby you probably need the smallest you can get.Start him on a fresh daily salad too if you haven't already. Do it each day in the hopes he will go to it. Put a water dish in there but he may not use it. Mist him like every other day with a mister bottle. I give my zoo a weekly soak in the tub as well which helps with hydration. Alos keep a check on the temps. If they are too low he won't eat and certainly can't digest his food.|`|WbyFUQJbaa	Is he warm enough?|`|esFphIFXaa	Either hes still acclimating to his new home or hes just not hungry yet let him get used to his home first. For any more info go to http://www.reptilestv.com/video/lizards/...  hope this helps enjoy.|`|YK8zJNluaa	Make sure that you also pu in some salads and fruit (nothing acidic). Cut in to small peices, so he can chew it. He should be okay, you won't always see them eat. They are a bit like people, they will eat when they are hungry.  Just make sure your temps are right.
O545aSKWaa	Put her on a leash and take her to something that makes a loud noise. Let's use a phone for this example.    When you're by the phone have your husband call the phone so it rings. As soon as your dog begins to try and get away correct her for it. As soon as you see that she's in calmed down give her a treat and praise her. If she knows any commands like SIT or LAY DOWN use those to your advantage. Remember the rule about giving a command is that they are not allowed to break it until you release them. That way you can give her the command to help her focus on a 'job' all the while you'll be desensitizing her to the loud sounds.    Do this for every sound that she's afraid of, but keep in mind you'll only want to do it for about 5 minutes twice a day and afterward, give her love and affection, end it on a positive note.    But do not reward the bad behavior, if she gets away from you while you're doing this, just calmly go over to her without saying anything and bring her right back to where you were and begin again!    Good luck, and if you want anymore help feel free to contact us. My wife and I have been training for five years now and love to help whenever we can :)|`|SqWJCZyeaa	Get her used to sounds. If she hides under the bed, quiet down. When she comes back out, yell a little louder. Each time yell a little louder. She might get used to it. And if she hides, leave her be. Ignore her.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	Yes, cajoling or otherwise trying to soothe a frightened dog, does reinforce the behavior.  Dogs view touching, a calming voice, saying their name, petting, etc. as reward for behavior. You only want to do these things when the dogs is in  a calm state and doing what you want them to do.    Since your dog runs away due to loud noise, you will need to be creative to help her to stop this behavior that is obviously causing her stress and discomfort.    Start by closing the doors to all the rooms where she can run and hide. Block off any doorways without doors so she cannot leave the area where you will be retraining/rehabilitating her.    Now, with you or you and husband in the room together with the dog, you will be doing this simple exercise a few times. Your dog may respond after just a try or two or it may take alittle longer but this should work very well to fix the problem.    One of you will make a loud noise or call one of your phones to have it ring, do one of the things that usually sends her running. Do it only once.  Now, she will start to get up to leave, that is when you will immediately correct her with a stern control word like NO or STOP.   You may have to stand up to sound and look more authoritative.  Do Not use the dogs name, do not touch her, just the control word.    Continue to use the control word until she stops the "escape routine".  Remain calm and talk in a tone that is not too loud for her. You can even walk over to her and block her with your body from leaving the area. You can then direct her back to where you would like her to be.    When she calms and comes back to a relaxed state, then you pet and even reward with a small treat.    Now, do the exercise again. Be consistent and calm and only reward when she is in a calm state.    Now before you begin this, are you sure that she does not have a hearing condition that could be actually making loud noise painful to her?    I am glad to hear people thinking "outside the box" so to speak about dog behavior., because almost always, it is the owner who creates or reinforces bad behavior in their dogs.  Good luck to you. If you are consistent and calm you will succeed in helping your dog.|`|vZJsRPBRaa	Watch the show the Dog Whisperer, the guy Cesar tells you everything about how to train and help ur dogs|`|xAibdGsTaa	Well one thing you can do is when your dog comes out from under the bed give him a treat and pet him. Make him feel he did something really good, then the more and More you do this the better he will probably get and eventually he might not even want to hide.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Feeling like your dog needs a therapist? I know that feeling. Patience,  and time for one thing.  Obedience school will boost her confidence. Also off leash parks. You have to act like the things that bother her are no big deal. Don't get tense, she will sense it. Have her on a leash and walk around the house while doing your stuff. This way if she gets spooked by something you will be there to act like its nothing and she can't run away. Get her to do a trick to distract her. Eventually she may forget what scared her. If its really bad let her off the leash. Reward her with a treat whenever she doesn't react to anything. Routine, tons of affection help.  My dog was scared of everything cars, door knobs, broccoli,collar, snow. Something like an object or a place (snow) you can put the leash on pivot around so she isn't aware which direction you will be going and slowly get closer to it. It may take days but before you know it, they will be beside it and not realize it. Hope this helps|`|9a0a2aee22dc10abe447c3e37948f718aa	Hi. My dog also hates it when voices are raised. The best way is to try and be as confident as possible and show her that there's nothing to be scared of (when it comes to the phone). The voices is more of a matter of you and your husband to try and adapt (if it's is indeed possible) the way that you speak.     Also, is she close to either your or your husband? If she is, it's best if they show her there's nothing wrong.    I hope this helps. It's a problem with some dogs...
7a0b8d7dd5636ea72eeaaf763882e180aa	random seizures can be causd by any number of things, the most common causes are high stress and low blood sugar.  and seizures are NOT always epilepsy.  and epileptic seizures RARELY last more than a few minutes...    my parents cocker had a single seizure a little while back, lasted a mere few minutes, after testing and being told "it could be epilepsy" i did alot of reaserch.    even if it is epilepsy vets will NOT medicate unless absolutly nessicary, the medications can cause more problems than they solve...  it could very well be a one time thing and your dog may naver have another seizure in its life.    however make sure to keep an eye on him, any kind of spasaming lasting multiple hours is bad for the muscles and brain|`|3kqsbpIbaa	My mom has an Italian Greyhound that has seizures.  He does not have them often, but he does get them periodically.  In the beginning, we did have him on medication per a vet's recommendation, but did not keep him on it.  Needless to say, he is now 13.  While the seizures can be scary, it is just important to make sure they are away from any objects that they can hurt themselves on and make sure other dogs stay away from them during the seizure.  Other dogs may take it as a sign of weakness and attack, even though they are best buds.  This happened to us once.  Good luck with your dog and I wish him/her many happy years ahead!|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	He could have had a seizure, I know dogs who have seizures and they have o take special medication. I am not really sure how it occurred if it is not in his bloodline, but I would ask your vet to be sure.

On the down side, it will also cost you xrays and the knockout drugs to get her to stay still for the xrays....just to make sure the hip isn't broken or there is some other damage...that should  run $75-150 additional depending on how expensive your vet is and how many xrays you might need.    When my cat dislocated his hip the vet was able to pop it in without xrays, so hopefully your vet will be able to do the same.    Good luck|`|zuOPSr5Eaa	if you're a regular client, most vets will accept a payment plan.  for most dislocated hips i've seen, the vet has to anesthetize the patient and pop the joint back into place, then bandage it so it will stay. they will have to x-ray it before and after, and again to monitor the progress.  if you can't afford it, another option (considering her age and likelihood of recurrence) is euthanasia. sometimes it's the most humane thing that can be done for an animal, sad but true.

Adding those fish all at once may have been too much for your tank to handle and is rocketing it into another cycle.
px27V5N9aa	Description for someone reading that may want to know what you mean:  I call it 'hooking on' but join up is another word other trainers use.  It's when your horse is moving and you invite it to join you, it hooks on to your invitation and comes to you. (No running from the halter).    I'm assuming you are in the round pen so that is where I'll start.    1.  As you are in the middle move your horse off at a trot.  2.  Reverse the other direction/repeat  this is to show the horse you can move her feet.  You have control.   3.  Toss the leadline at the butt if need be.  Don't use a whip.  4   Do not let the horse slow or stop.  Make the horse trot around.  If he runs, so be it.  He is not allowed to stop.  5.  If he cuts into the circle toward you, use the leadline to smack him away..or hold your hands up and 'push' your bubble towards him.  Make a noise to say no..like "aaaht" .   He's being lazy and also trying to intimidate.  Don't let him.  6.  That leadline can reach him and you are always next to him.  you are FAST he thinks!  You are always reprimanding him too when he slows!  7.  He will tip an ear to you and ask permission to stop.  Don't let him stop the first time he asks.  Wait til the second time he tips that ear to you.  8.  To stop, take a step or two or three backwards in front of his shoulder and hold up a finger/hand.  To signal you want 'whoa' and you can say "whoa".  9.  If he doesn't stop, you need to step more in front of him and then step backwards to get his attention.  He has to learn this is your signal for WHOA.  10.  Let him stand and rest looking at you.  Repeating this and he will finally snake his head down to show that he is submissive and accepting of your high status of the herd.  Licking and chewing shows he understands.    After a few times of this then you can continue to this  11.  Walk to him and then turn and walk away casually.  He should follow.  If not, go back and invite him to follow again *by showing your back*|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	I personally am against join up.  I dont use join up, and my horse just follows me around the pasture.   Even when it's feeding time, I just come into the pasture and she starts following me.  My other horse is the leader, so he's too busy being the boss :)  And his personality is much different.  To me, It's more that you have to be fair to the horse to get its trust, not just follow somebody's ideas that worked on their horse and may or may not work on yours.  Dont be discouaged, however.  Its just my own opinion.  Its a lot more work for a small more reward.  I think it takes time, patience, and perserverence.  It's not gonna happen in one day, and your mare was distracted.  You should give it time :)|`|rsp33Aysaa	if she wouldn't come to you, it sounds like she either doesn't understand the ques, or (depending on how long you've had her) she might not quite completely trust you yet.  'Join up' seems a little overstated; you might as well just spend time bonding while grooming, or going out in the pasture and just playing without catching her.|`|HCuArmpGaa	Congrats! Join Up is an amazing technique that i also use with my horses. It is a great way to bond with your horse. I also had trouble with it before (not that i am perfect at it right now either). I would suggest searching on You Tube for videos. Also, it can get frustrating at times when your horse doesn't seem to want to join up. Just keep trying. My mare (also about 9 years old, and was impossible to catch) took me a long time and lots of patience to be able to join up with her. Take your time and try You Tube for some videos. You can see how Monty does it. i also try to say what i am doing while doing it. It keeps me focused on the mare. Like saying "eyes on eyes, shoulders square, pushing her away till she decides to come to you"    Good luck. The end result is amazing! My mare is now a back pocket pony! And comes running when she sees you to catch her.    Add:  I had another mare that charged at me when she saw me. I did join up with her and she is a sweetie! NEVER tried to charge (or do anything like that) ever again!
AoSeHXeQaa	You might try caprylic acid - it kills yeast in the body.  I havent tried it on a dog, but take it myself.  Its a form of zinc, so I wouldnt expect it to cause problems with a dog.  I know yeast overgrowth can cause a lot of apparently unrelated health problems.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	I don't know why the rice would cause a yeast infection.Do you use white rice or brown? Brown is better.You should also add some yogurt and fish ( canned salmon with bones) to her diet for calcium,and an egg three times a week. Chicken necks are good,too.The yogurt may also help with the yeast. Where is the infection,on her skin or ears?
rLDf1gGGaa	No cat is really truly hypoallergentic, alot of people are allergic to the cats saliva, and all cats have dander.    There is some person i believe in australia suppostly breeding fluffy hypoallergic Moggies, Cost mega dollars, and which in my opinion, cannot be possible, as there a mix.     A study of 321 patients with allergies showed that dark-coloured cats where 4 times more likely to cause more sneezing, wheezing and overall allergy-symptom than light-coloured cats did.     Up to 25% of Rex cats that are in need of assistance from rescue organizations are there because their new owners cannot cope with their allergic reaction to their Rex cat. Cats bought because of their so-called hypoallergenic nature.     Some low allergy cats  Sphynx   Devon Rex  Cornish Rex  Laperm-the poodle cat    I've also heard torishell cats generally cause less allergies then black cats, However the only way to totally test your allergies with cats is to spend at least 2hours in a pen with individual adult cats at a shelter, as kittens cause less allergies then adults|`|RN1wGlWWaa	There are NO hypoallergenic cats.  There are a few breeds that shed less then normal and may be tolerated.  Depends on how bad your allergies are.    The Rexes (Cornish/Devon/Selkirk), Bengals, Ocicats, Oriental Shorthairs/Siamese (only those with short tight coats), and Siberians are some breeds that you can look into.    Keep in mind its a 50/50 chance.  If you are still allergic, then be sure to return the cat to the breeder.    Some things to do:    1.  Keep the kitten/cat OUT of your bedroom - have one room free of any cat hair/dander.    2.  Wash your hands after petting the cat and do not let them in your face.    3.  Use HEPA filters in your vacuum and furnace.    4.  Wipe the cats down daily with distillled drinking water - it will cut down the dander.|`|AA12322387	There is no hypo-allergenic breed of cats or dogs, period.  All cats and dogs produce dander...they secrete it in their skin.  The hairless ones are the worst because they have no hair to catch it.    This is a fact..just research it.  There is no such thing.|`|3aed218d7132fc2698b7dfdebaab08f6aa	There is no such thing as a completely hypo-allergenic cat. What you may want to do is look into getting a Sphinx, any Rex variety, or a Siberian. The Sphinx is almost completely hairless, Rexes have curly hair rather than fur and tend to produce less dander (the actual allergen), and Siberians do not produce the particular protein that causes about 90% of cat allergies when attached to the skin.     If you can't afford to get a purebred, you may want to find a short haired kitten who you can get used to taking a bath every week. If you also give fish oil (no cod liver oil though) every other day and brush on a daily basis, you'll have a nearly hypo-allergenic cat. I had to do this for my Maine Coon mix and my Bombay/Siamese mix while I was living with my dad and even one of my friends never had any allergic reaction even though she was severely allergic.|`|7a0b8d7dd5636ea72eeaaf763882e180aa	theres no truly hypoalergenic breed of cat as many people are allergic to the saliva (which ALL cats have) and others are allergic to the dander.    if yours is a dander allergy you may wnt to look into cornish and devon rex, laperm, siberian and Spynx cats.    if its a saliva allergy unfortunatly you dont have much luck.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	As everyone pointed out no cats(or dogs) are truly hypo. I do want to point out that the Sphynx breed is not considered to be hypo at all.  They have a lot of skin oils & dander & must be bathed weekly.  You can check on this site of a breeder saying this same thing.    http://www.angelfire.com/nc2//wizardgate...    They can be okay for some ppl but are not considered hypo.  Just cuz they don't have hair doesn't mean they are allergen free.

They are not quiet. If your looking for a quiet dog, usually a medium size dog and up is quiet.. the small ones are usually very yappy. If you get it as a pup and raise it around the cat, you should be fine. I would look into adopting from your shelter because they can help you find one that fits your requirements. You could get a book too. There are so many breeds that its hard to go down the list to say "this one yes, that one no" but it really comes down to the dog's personality. Terriers are suppose to not be good with cats, and huskies... but I am sure there are people on here that would argue it because of the personality of their dog.|`|9a0a2aee22dc10abe447c3e37948f718aa	Actually, my dog gets along fine with my mum's cat, however the feeling isn't mutual.

ec9d2f98640df891e44853cb6d85e683aa	If any dog is underweight and you believe you are feeding the correct amount of food (about 2 cups of high quality dry per day) then you should be taking your baby to the vet.  Weight loss is a big indicator that something could be wrong, so get him checked out right away.    Feed your puppy when you are present (don't just leave food on the floor) so you can monitor their appetite and consumption.  This is a good habit to learn now because you can identify potential issues faster.      Overfeeding your dog will just cause another set of issues.  So make sure you are buying good quality food.  Do not follow the recommendations on the food, it is typically over-stated.|`|pZivWQixaa	You need to feed him normal dog food, in slow amounts. DO NOT OVERFEED him right away. It can make things worse if you let him wolf down a ton at a time! Just give him a healthy brand of dog food that he likes, even generic stuff will work.    Also, make sure your dog doesn't have worms, that might be the cause of the underweight issue.|`|5bIQr3WCaa	First you need to find out why. Is the dog eating quality puppy food?

AA10830538	For a horse that's broken to ride and healthy, you're looking at anywhere from $1500 to $5000 - more for a rare breed or one with good bloodlines.  Then you have the cost of feed and hay and boarding it somewhere...not mention brushes, combs, and tack.  Horses are expensive!  They're great, if you have the money and the time, but it's a big commitment.    Try to talk your parents into riding lessons instead... you'll get to spend time with a horse every week for much less money than it would cost to have your own.  Or look into volunteering with horses - some organizations offer horseback therapy for disabled people, which is a great way to get some volunteer hours, hang out with great people, and spend time with horses.
AA11702116	I think it depends on how close your mama bunn is to you, and whether she'll allow you to or not! Are you close to her? When you get close to the babies, does she get defensive, or does she just watch you and allow you to?     Here's a good site about how to interact with your bunny family -   http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/surpriseli...|`|AA12106467	I've raised thousands of rabbits over 24 years and have handled many litters even within minutes after they are born.  I have yet to lose a single litter from me handling the babies.  In fact, I think it is actually a good thing to do.  A person needs to check the nestbox every couple days to make sure there are not any dead babies in the nest box.  The stench from a dead baby can cause the mother to avoid the litter and not milk.  The stench can also attract flies, which can lead to a not-so-common problem where the flies lay eggs on the babies and the eggs later develop into larvae under the baby bunnies' skin that feel like bumps later.  I forget the name of the fly offhand, I believe it's called bot fly.  Another good reason is to check to make sure that the bedding in the nestbox hasn't gotten too thin beneath the babies.  If the babies get down to the floor of the nestbox and the floor of the nestbox becomes slick, not allowing them good footing.  It can cause sproddled leg, where one of the rear legs juts out abnormally.  The last thing I recommend checking for is that there is no urine/ammonia build up in the nestbox.  The ammonia stench can cause the mother to avoid milking the babies.  That's why I used pegboard for the bottom of my nestboxes to allow any urine to drain out of the nestbox.  The best bedding I've found for a nestbox is straw.  Make sure it isn't moldy.  People I know seem to have less luck with woodchips or hay.  Wood chips and hay carry a much stronger smell than straw and I've notice that people using hay or woodchips instead of straw tend to have more trouble with the doe having the babies outside of the nestbox.  Too large of a nestbox can also cause the doe to want to have them outside the nestbox.  A doe likes to have her babies in a space not much bigger than herself so she feels like she is hiding.    Please note that often does will have more babies than they can milk and keep alive.  As the doe gets beyond about 2.5 years old this becomes more prevalent because the doe is beyond her prime.  At this point, the number of babies the doe will be able to milk will start dropping.|`|AA11019643	When my doe had babies, I touched them immediately.  It really depends on how you treat your doe.

Don't interfere any more than you have to, and they will work out their relationship.   Always feed her first, and when going out of doors, always allow her to go first, behind you, but ahead of the puppy.    Don't scold her if she growls or snaps. This is important communication. She won't bite, unless it is just a nip to tell the kid that his manners aren't correct.   Don't coddle the kid if she makes him 'yipe'.. She was teaching him something important.

The puppy gets a lot of attention - because it needs it - and it disturbs the older dogs routine, and it also changes the dynamics of the household.

He was very well behaved too. He loves kids and we thought he'd love a puppy too. But he just kept growling. He didnt eat right for two days. He was so jealous. But now, they've started playing together and they're fine. We were worried because the big dog snapped at the puppy when he was eating, and the puppy had slobber on his back, but then we realized that if he had meant to hurt the puppy (he's a rott) he would have. And we've gotten over him growling at the puppy too. We just figure they're going to do it when we're not home anyway. Now, I think the growling is just play anyway. I think you should give it some time and if it persists after a couple of weeks, then worry.|`|c30239920b2e68acbc8bfd8622430880aa	Seeing as your older dog is a female, she may be trying to sympathize with the puppy.  Has she ever been a mom? (she may be trying to recall her instincts).  Does the puppy react meanly when the dog approaches? He may be scaring her.  If so, let them sit on a porch or be outside with one another.  It will be more like neutral ground and they will relax.  The puppy is most assuradly asserting his dominace.  It may be his personality, nature, or the submissive nature of your adult dog.  This is work itself out in time, but be sure to pay attention to both dogs.  If you want to counteract this process, feed the older dog first, give her treats first and show that she is more the alpha dog.  Monitor the puppy's behavior.

306a5da7a4bbe9184cd02f0c766e26b8aa	Sometimes it is pretty stupid, like when the owner just thinks its cute.    But I do have Whippets and a hairless Crested, and I live in Minnesota.  So clothes are a necessity in the winter and the dogs are grateful for a sweater in the house and coats/snoods when we go for walks.      I used to have a Whippet who would get so excited when the clothes tub came out in the fall!  She would also play with the youngsters, who can be pretty rough, until they would grab her sweater, and then she would get really mad.  She did NOT like them damaging her clothes!  That girl LOVED her clothes and would try to get them on herself!  *sigh*, it has been 2 1/2 years since she died and I still miss her terribly.|`|AA11813754	Only the big dogs.  Nothing is sadder than a Great Dane in a tutu.|`|2cd0e59e9ea9d3c87bd14a10c2374ea0aa	no...i think its cute|`|AA11204972	Yes.  I don't know who I feel sorry for more, the dog or the owner for being in that state of mind|`|AA11129947	If you're doing that for the sake of keeping your dog warm during Winter, that's perfectly fine.|`|36d6641b6148b8883c38048758ee44dcaa	yeah, i mean they dont need them. in a dog society, if you were a dog hanging with your doggy mates, they would all laugh at you!|`|0160d2881c751ba412372d59c02cb13faa	slightly, but i mean, you're spending money on your dogs for unnecessary items, so more important than demeaning (i mean, if the dog doesn't mind, then whatever) you're basically giving money away (your dog will wear it like once, and then refuse to ever again, or they could chew it into pieces, most likely).|`|AA12291003	we have 5 dogs. one of these dogs absolutely loves to wear clothes. she will honest to god priss around showing them off. she is a pit/golden lab mix. so no, if your dog likes clothes then it is not demeaning at all. we also have a chihuahua who gets really cold in the winter and likes her fake fur coat.|`|2070ff5148be60f845058a5f4861dbcbaa	Yes and no because that like saying oh you look bad in clothes    so you have to take them off but if the other person doesn't then     they don't have to take them off so if we can wear clothes they     should be able to too. but sometimes people take it to far like     putting jewelry on a dog or makeup on a dog. but basically all a     dog needs is a shirt and a top to make them look cute cause     they already are in first place.|`|8a061f2bbbaf4f958e5757f3f272d861aa	Only if they're last year's styles.|`|d001086d8b0625f6ce991442033972f2aa	yes, especially to the owner!|`|AA10597960	no if your dog is little and cute Or if it is summer!|`|caf9a4ba0afde52ab323761e011aae50aa	a big dog yes, a small dog not so much but I still think that it has to be uncomfortable for the dog cuz it already has a full body of fur.....unless you shave your dog cuz your weird|`|b76167fdd54517e88f289d27d9799837aa	Yes I do. Would you want to have to wear ugly pink sweaters or something?|`|912699441281593ec5a5e90e251b72daaa	I have a very small Chihuahua, and no I did not get her to be more like any stupid hollywood bimbo, but anyways she gets cold very easily and it was recommended that she have clothing to keep her warm, especially during the winter when it snows here in NYC.  She doesn't seem to mind her clothing at all and I don't think its demeaning to her as its helping her.  For the person that said it's wasting money, if I have the money to "waste" then who cares.|`|8e33c7fd9fc1ce3854125d662d986a66aa	I guess it's up to the owner--little old ladies may do the sweater on the tiny dogs because it makes her feel closer to the animal. Some sports fans like to include their dog on game day with a team shirt. Personally---when my dog got out of surgery, the one thing that calmed him down when I was at work was when I had them put one of my old shirts on him--the familiar scent helped calm him when he was confused. I also toss a t-shirt on him during long road trips--he has really long hair and sheds badly, so this helps contain all the excess fur.|`|AA11393132	Absolutely! That is a huge pet peeve of mine.|`|AA11618088	"yeah, i mean they dont need them."  Some don't, some do.  My dog has no body fat and hardly any fur.  Without sweaters, she shivers at anything below about 70.      I don't have a problem with warmth items and rain items - my dog desparately needs them.  I have a problem with tutus and fur collars and suits and stupid t-shirts.|`|AA10458904	Definitely. Dogs in clothes=tacky  Plus they prolly can't breathe easy.  And they always try anything to get them off...|`|fbc1e0976369953a458a3126eb4cbc0faa	Yes if your are under sixty and have things to do in life.|`|AA11295766	yes. i don't personaly like dogs wearing dresses and tuxs.bandanas are okay but dresses? sweaters to because some are light coated and are cold.besides that no. i mean shoes on dogs??????

Make sure yours has access to plenty of fresh water. Also occasionally feed small pieces of fresh vegetables. Experiment to see what kind he likes.|`|AA10804655	it's probably pregnant...or a boy and has a hard on.|`|9c0db29a314c52f99f0c280f948a691aaa	make sure he  gets enough water|`|1ce668fffabe55f966c904a18243e408aa	LMAO!

6e0328691c25087ca0d59b77f569a5d3aa	Yes, dogs can get a stye in their eye just like a human.  And, if it is a stye the remdy is about the same.  Use a clean warm, wet compress on the dog's eye. Do it several times a day, and if it is a stye it should clear up in a few days with no further treatment.  If the infection persists, you will need to take the dog to the vet who may be able to prescribe an oinment as a remedy.    Good Luck~*|`|AA11602174	yeah, depending on the area of the dog it is on, there could be a staff infection and there is a lot of moisture around that area... it will form a zit or zit like thing on that area and doesn't typically bother them... my dog had an infection and moisture was staying around her stomach and she would get little zits in a fold of her skin, we didn't notice them one day until she had flipped over for us to rub her belly!  we took her to the doctor and they gave us antibiotics (i do believe it was cephalexin aka Keflex) and told us to rub johnson's baby powder on the area that those bumps were forming to absorb any access moisture...  hope all goes well and good luck|`|5bde011392b7c0f203f1639855115244aa	anything is possible....get him checked by a vet|`|AA11113301	Keep an eye on it for the next few days and if it gets bigger then I would take the animal to the vet.  In the meantime, just wipe the area with a warm compress.  Good Luck.|`|AA10262134	Yes, you need to take him/her to the vet to get an antibiotic ointment.|`|eaa646979ef5fb6b2c7785615d4ca2bbaa	Yes My 12y/o gets them a lot. Just check on from time to time.

AA11814368	Yes, this is what is usually prepared for dogs with sensitive tummies...green beans added will be even better too!    Just be careful not to feed too much because this can add alot of weight on your baby quickly especially if you use white rice...also another thing to think of is your puppy's teeth....giving it hard, dry food helps strengthen it's teeth so you may want to even add that to the mix, it also assures you that your puppy will be getting all the nutrients it needs.  Good luck with whatever you do and give your furbaby a hug for me.|`|AA12365613	Yes, it's good if they have upset stomachs. Boil the chicken & then shred by hand.

AA10982839	You need to check your local county to see what are the laws governing this in your area.  I would never recommend this because I work in a zoo and there is a lot to it that you may never have thought about. While you say you have a very huge backyard each animal requires a certain amount of area to themselves.  I have an extra 2 acres and would never attempt that because that is not enough area.   Try going to your local zoo and volunteering to see what is required to run a zoo.  You will need an education equal to that of a zoo keeper.  You need to find out how much it will cost to feed the animals, vet care, etc.  We have a very small zoo in our town and it cost 1.5 mill to run it each year.  It costs over 100,000 just to feed the animals.  Ticket sales will never equal the cost it takes to run the zoo.  Very few large zoos in the country take in enough at the gate to run their zoos.  Most zoos rely on grants and tax monies to stay afloat.    Have you thought of doing animals rescue instead?  This can be very rewarding and is very much needed.    Good Luck|`|18c2b3da260806ed371f90555af6f88eaa	Best go to some zoo and spend some time around,and ask the caretaker and then administration I think you can find your answer, and don't forget to ask your local authorities.|`|6fa964dae3600ec14af9551118955db3aa	Careful, making and managing a zoo takes alot of money and time. And I mean ALOT of money. Theres the building, buying animals, right enviroment, feeding animals, you may need to get a zookeepers degree or hire one. Then the maintenence... oof. O_o  And you need to ask local police if it is ok, and make sure you have plenty of room per animal, or they will be miserable. And you may need a sponcer. Oh, and a security guard if you have potentialy dangerouse animals, incase if they escape.

Yo he visto como ba?an gatos, debes primero ganartre la confianza del gato son muy nerviosos.    Si el gato si tiene mucha confianza es posible que lo hagas eso tienes que comprobar primero, el gato puede sufrir un ataque nervioso y morirse, asi que lo m?as importante es verificar si el gato confia muchisimo en t.    El agua debe ser tibia, y debes tener unas dos toallas cerca para secarlo ese rato, no uses secadora porque les asusta el ruido.    Si tardas en secarlo puede enfermarse.    El momento que lo metas al agua debes acariciarlos mucho antes que vaya tomando confianza en ti, lo sujetas dos patas en cada mano, y lo vas metiendo de cabeza; si as el gato no se esfueza mucho puedes continuar, si ves que se pone nervioso no continues, el gato no es ba?able.    Necesitas de dos personas el uno que le sujete como te expliqu y la otra persona que tambin tiene que ser de confianza del gato debe refregarlo suavemente,  ojo con que la cabeza entera tiene que estar completamente afuera.    Te recomiendo no utilizar jabones, si se le ba?a es solamente para matar las pulgas y los huevos, no llegan a ensucierse tanto como para que sea esa la razn.  El jabn puede intoxicarles debido a que se lavan con la lengua.     El ba?o debe durar lo menos posible, no toleran mucho tiempo el agua.  Puede ser de 2 a 3 minutos.    Pero nuevamente te recomiedo mucha confianza con el gato, para as evitar ataques nerviosos.|`|de58100c2489feaf6aca467083ccc969aa	Yo tengo dos y los ba?o cada a?o. A pesar que dede que son chiquitos lo hago, le temen al sonido del agua corriendo, entonces debo llenar algun recipiente con agua bien calentita y asi no se asustan tanto.

Mientras tanto, si los ba?as por mero gusto hazlo cuando se embarren de algo muy desagradable (tienden a hacerlo de vez en cuando, les gusta el acidito de la basura o similares) pero con mucho cuidado y paciencia.  En ste ltimo caso hazlo slo si tu gato es manso y confa mucho en ti.|`|0397c1a4d7b12907f5b349fdd85bc0f8aa	si, secalo bien y rapido|`|be453bdaa3125f3393c43871d070a82faa	Hay una idea muy extendida que dice que los gatos no son muy amigos del agua. Esta creencia es ciertaa medias: Por que si acostumbras al gato desde peque?o al aguael gato disfrutar mucho del ba?o y del agua.  El gato puede aprender a ba?arse (como a otras actividades) pero este aprendizaje debe ser realizado en la etapa de socializacin del cachorro, es decir, entre el primer y segundo mes de vida. En estos meses el gato es receptivo a todas las ense?anzas de manejo social que se quieran impartir en l. De hecho, no slo el ba?o se puede tolerar perfectamente si se aprendi de peque?o; adems es una actividad que refuerza la relacin social entre el gatito y su due?o, junto con el cepillado, las caricias y los juegos.    Y vamos a demostrarte que no todos lo gatos tienen miedo al agua: muchos no slo juegan con el agua, sino que adems se mojan solos. Como ejemplo te diremos una raza, los Turco Van, que viven en la zona del lago Van (Turqua). El alimento natural  de esta raza de gatos son los peces que pueden pescar en el ro. El mismo mecanismo utiliza el jaguar que tiene en los animales acuticos la mayor parte de su dieta.    Ba?ar al gato puede ser una actividad placentera para l y para ti, slo debes acostumbrar al felino a dicho procedimiento|`|7b109418dd1124c667f9aa1fcf6d8582aa	si, se recomienda una vez al mes, y si est chiquito tu gato acostumbralo a secarse con la secadora|`|f4108162a70efe22a6ac98d65cd63dedaa	si si los ensenas desde chiquitos lo puedes hacer pero no con tanta frecuencia por los aceites en la piel de ellos debes asegurate que uses un shampoo que no sea lo suficientemente fuerte como para que le disminuya los aceites en la piel porque de lo contrario se les puede caer el pelo.SuerteLiz|`|f1751104176a9bdded2795acd766d6a3aa	De "poder", claro que puedes... diferente es que NO DEBES...    Un gato, es distinto al perro en cuanto a su pelaje, el ba?o solo har que le de alergia y que se estrese, lo que afectar su salud.  No lo ba?es, el se encargar se asearse, no te preocupes por eso. eso si, esterilizalo y as evitaras que llegue con malos olores a casa, por andar peleando por alguna gata.    Mucha suerte|`|fd5fca3b08d39af750d234440e2272e9aa	Yo siempre tuve gatos y siempre los ba?e. Creo que no solo que si se puede sino que es necesario.  No es recomendable ba?arlos todo el tiempo, pero al menos dos o tres veces al a?o si.  Una, porque les ayuda a eliminar todo el pelo sobrante en la epoca de recambio, y dos , porque al igual que a todo el mundo, el polvo y el smog se le pegan al cuero y te van a agradecer un ba?o de vez en cuando.  Ademas del cepillado, el ba?o es importante para que no se les formen bolas de pelo. Lo que sucede generalmente, es que los gatos, como son de mantener su propio aseo, no nocesitan ba?os tan seguido. Ademas no les gusta demasiado. Lo ideal es que cuando lo ba?es, lo dejes despues que se asee solito y se seque en un lugar cerrado y calientito. Por un lado para que se le pase el enojo, y por otro, para que no tome frio y se pueda resfriar. Yo los dejo encerrados en el ba?o en invierno, con la estufa prendida hasta que esten bien secos. Y en verano si los dejo solos porque se van a acostar al sol...  es normal que se enojen , pero despues se les pasa.  Actualmente tengo una perejita de gatos. La gata es mas docil y de deja ba?ar tranquila, pero el macho....el es otra historia...no le gusta nada el agua, asi que es dificultoso ba?arlo. Pero no le queda otra.   Si ves que se te pone muy rebelde, podes darle algun tranquilizante, como los que se les da para viajar...te lo venden en la veterinaria, pero primero consulta bien con el vet. Sino, podes averiguar en alguna peluqueria de mascotas. Ellos estan mas acostumbrados, y como es solo cada cuatro o cinco meses, no es algo tan caro...  Te recomiendo el ba?o....vas a ver que cuando se le pase el enojo, te lo va a agradecer...

Here's some basic stuff:    He should always have timothy hay (or another hay, just not alfalfa) to munch on, it's good for their health both physically and mentally. Feed it a pellet based diet, free of chunks of sunflower seeds and corn, those are unnecessary. Supplement this with some fresh vegetables, but stay away from those high in water content like lettuce. I suggest getting a book or looking online for a list of veggies that are okay.     Provide lots of stuff for it to play with and chew. They like digging, throwing and chewing so keep that in mind.|`|7627c7a08f9f9da4a5db618922c3fa8daa	cuddle him loads! feed him 2 times daily and give him a large grass area to run around in.

AA11151936	Generally, dogs can do it themselves, but any dog can run into trouble, especially 1st time mothers.  I raise Yorkies, and I have had to take a mother for a c-section a couple of times.  Once for an oversize pup, once for a puppy coming out sideways.  I never let my dogs do it alone, was the father smaller than your dog?  Even if he was you can get a throwback, (an over sized puppy from generations ago.)  How old is your dog?  Is this her first litter?  You should count weeks from first breeding, (9), take her temperature, when it drops below 100 she should deliver within  12 hours.  If you need any more information you can e-mail me with questions @yahoo.com|`|AA12260782	DON'T BREED OR BUY WHILE SHELTER ANIMALS DIE!!!  For every puppy you breed and find a home for you are killing a puppy in a shelter because that is one less home looking to adopt one.  There are too many dogs dying in shelters to breed more.

Home breeding/deliveries can be dangerous, but especially with a small dog like a Yorkie.    Talk to a Yorkie breeder to find out more.  Talk to your vet to make sure your dog is healthy enough to handle it and make sure you're prepared for any complications - have an emergency vet number handy.

I do not believe that you have the knowledge that you need to become a breeder.  This is a long process and it takes hours of your time to care for them properly.  Please educate yourself on this before you begin any type of breeding!
AA12148896	Is there any reason why this is a problem? What's more annoying is having a dog that thinks that the hose is a great game. That's annoying.    With any animal fear, the key is desensitisation.   This means, repeatedly exposing the dog to the frightening thing in calm situations, thereby allowing it to learn from experience that nothing dangerous happens. The dog's instincts are telling it that the hose is dangerous. You have to let the dog learn that this is incorrect.    Leave it running for no reason at times. Sit cheerfully next to the running hose with a book. Step on the running hose. Ignore the running hose. Do not comfort the dog if she is frightened. Ignore her fear and praise her calm. Desensitisation with a lack of encouragement for negative behaviour = reprogrammed dog.|`|AA10862583	Try to make the experience fun for him. Start maybe by playing a bit with him and then introduce the hose with the toy so he can associate it with playing or start by wetting his paws a bit and then give him a treat and continue with maybe the tail and so forth. That way he will associate the water and hose with treats and be more mellow. Hope this helps.|`|57cc37c40ff95cdf082614c5c8b8f83eaa	my dog loves water...a heck of a time trying to keep her out of it, but she too, doesn't like it when the hose is on...maybe they don't like it because they don't know where it's coming from...then again i have a hard time keeping my dog out of the bath tub when the water is running...just one of those goofy quirks i suppose. Good luck on conquering this one!!|`|AA11924295	well my sisters dog is scared of the water hose too.

e3c905b09b4ff0e0ead69d7505d48e1aaa	All of the breeds are hunting dogs. This means the have a need to work. Work for them means useing thier mouths and noses. They will always chew, it keeps thier senses sharp. It's just in thier nature. I recomend any "kong " toy for duribility. Get at least two, one for play and one to be given as a reward for positive behavior. Fill the reward one and let them have it. When they are finished with it, remove it right away and don't give it back till it is earned. Your dog is probally pretty smart, that means you will have to use your brain to exercise his . Good luck! Let me know if I can help anymore.|`|e2545f31ed8facb706c34a6b81793f94aa	He should be long past the puppy chewing stage.  If he is just chewing his bones quickly, there isn't much you can do about it.  He's a good sized dog, and will chew through stuff quickly.  I've noticed that the compressed rawhides take a little bit longer for my Lab and German short haired to chew up.  I also give each of my dogs cow hooves (at Petsmart) to chew on.  Try giving him a Kong filled with treats, biscuits, peanut butter, ice (whatever will fit!).  Kongs are pretty indestructible, and will keep him busy chewing.    If he's destroying your stuff, you need to train him.  I had the same problem with my flip flops when my Lab was a puppy. I finally made a "toy box" for him. Everything he was allowed to chew on/play with was (and still is) in this plastic storage box, and I put the toys back in the box each night. At the beginning, I would put a few treats at the bottom of the box to get him used to finding his things. This worked GREAT! He finally realized that his toys could be found in the box, not on my bedroom floor.    Good luck :)|`|a1f7f9b686d8ee69c96d0b5b7a47fea2aa	He wont stop.|`|253be93b00e6e42308bec4a7ce40a6e6aa	Untill you teach him not to|`|9c86f6c921133bcdb8c1cef9c59bca7caa	Probably a couple of years.

Get some rawhide bones or chews for him to save your shoes and stuff.  Another great idea is to find an old leather glove and let him chew on that with your hand inside.  Great bonding between the two of you and it will massage his gums, which dogs like.|`|AA11746917	He should be long past the chewing stage. However, since he isn't, you're going to have to train him. I think there is a spray that you can put on things that deters dogs from chewing on it. I don't know the name of it, but I'm sure a pet store can advise you.|`|AA10527960	He's too old for this to have been a passing puppy phase. This is a set habit now, and he will continue to chew stuff. I suggest you invest in some Kong dog toys.    And the name of that spray Taffi suggested is Bitter Apple.
ca156152c9b7c527c3eefa2193568ae9aa	Border collies are great dogs, I have had one before. I think I might know what the yellow puss could be. It is canine distemper. Most puppy vacinations cover this so this is a good reason to get all vacinations and not just the ones needed by law. As I am not a vet; I would still recommend that your friend take thier collie to the Vet A.S.A.P. because if it is canine distemper then its something that shouldn't be taken lightly. In fact its deadly.|`|AA10624130	It could be something serious or something as simple as an infected tear duct.  In either case, your friend's dog needs to see a vet.  Good Luck
AA12072788	I had a problem similar like that when i received a young rat that i hadn't reared myself. There was never any blood but I made sure that she had plenty of food and a good supply of scraps (she liked some things with a bit of protein but that sort of stuff tends to foul quickly) and when she was full or tired (not asleep) I would reach my hand into the cage and if she came up I would stroke her around the base of the neck and side. Eventually she stopped mistaking my hands as food (poor eyesight) and became less skittish and will come up to the door or bars for pets and such. (making a loud noise was also semi effective.)|`|20de523b90946ed6e2b54fc5defddc3baa	Babies bite thats a given, but you need to make sure that they dont keep biting. If a baby rat bites the most likely reason is it was poorly socialised by the person you got it off. The best thing to do is to handle it as much as you can. I had similar problems with my babies. And when they bite gently tap them on the nose to say dont do this. (but dont do it hard) they will be shocked when u do this and they dont like it so in time they will stop.

AA11706151	Dogs are a lot of work!  If you're not up to it, maybe you should give her away before it's too late to train her at all!  Dachshunds are like terriers - they are tough, stubborn dogs and hitting or slapping them will only make them bite you!  You need to use a leash and collar.  Sign up for a training class or get a professional trainer to help you.    First off, she is training YOU.  She barks until you throw the toy and then you throw it so she gets what she wants.  That's not good!  You need to take control of her right NOW!  And she shouldn't be on the bed or furniture - it tells the dog she's your equal and she doesn't have to listen to you. Absolutely NO games of tug-o-war; that teaches the dog to challenge your authority. Make her sit and stay before you feed her. A dominant dog needs to be constantly reminded that she is NOT your equal.     She needs to be in a crate for housebreaking.  The point of crate training is to use the crate temporarily when the dog is a puppy - like you'd use a playpen for a baby. It helps with housebreaking because a normal dog wants to be clean and is less likely to go to the bathroom when she has to lie in it. Hence the old saying, "Don't crap where you sleep!" Make sure the crate is small - just big enough to lie down in comfortably. Don't put in any beds, newspapers or towels that will absorb the pee. Clean the crate with a pet product that eliminates urine odors - never use ammonia!    Make sure you are taking her out often enough - at least every four hours. If she's not clean in the crate overnight, that means waking up in the middle of the night for a while to take her out. If she has any accidents in the crate, don't give her any water for at least three hours before bedtime.    Until she is COMPLETELY trained (like in a year from now), keep her in the crate or on a leash next to you at all times. Right after she eats or drinks or whenever you see her start to sniff around, take her outside to the same spot and stay outside until she goes - even if it takes two hours. And it's not playtime, it's pee time! Praise her and let her know this is what you want.     When you're out or asleep or can't supervise the pup, she's safe in her crate where she can't learn any bad habits or electrocute herself by chewing on electrical cords.     Crates are not a substitute for training, exercising and spending quality time with a dog.     She needs a LOT more exercise - at least a 30 minute walk twice a day.  If you don't, then she is going to use all that energy being a pain in your butt.  And practice obedience training lessons every day for fifteen minutes!  Teach her to come, heel, sit, lie down and stay.    Read some great books on training. (Try not to pick books randomly - there are a lot of bad books out there also!)  These are some of my favorites and you can get them on Amazon.com  What All Good Dogs Should Know  Volhard  http://www.volhard.com/  Good Owners, Great Dogs - Brian Kilcommins  Dog Tricks : Eighty-Eight Challenging Activities for Your Dog from World-Class Trainers by Haggerty and Benjamin  Training Your Dog: The Step by Step Method - Volhard  Dog Problems - Benjamin  Cesar's Way - Cesar Millan  Also, watch the Dog Whisperer on the National Geographic Channel.

Hmmm...you have a dog, & a spoiled one at that! Guess who's responsible for that? You are giving her exactly what she wants when she bites.That's a dog's way of controlling situations. You give her what she wants when she barks just to shut her up, don't you?   Did you research the breed before you got one? Have you even done any research now?  You have a very intelligent & headstrong breed. They may be small but they aren't the breed for wimps! They are also barkers.   1- Quit correcting her physically! You will make her more aggressive!   2- Don't let the dog outsmart you. That's just pitiful when it happens & it IS happening. Your dog is the boss.   3- Quit being a weenie & get started in obedience class ASAP.  Nothing's going to change by you wishing for it so you need to actually get to work. Start by learning the proper way to teach your dog.  I see you've been given the advice to "rub her nose in it". That's barbaric & out dated & another reason for your dog to bite.

Dachshunds are called "earth dogs" the LOVE LOVE LOVE to dig.   an "earth dog" means that this dog was MADE to chase after vermin..like rats, moles, mice etc. when they cant do what NATURE made them for they get BORED!!!   what would you do if you were locked in a house all day and weren't able to talk on the phone, hang out with your friends and you never got a chance to play with your "master" wouldn't you be pissed?   if this is too much responsibility for you sweetie...give the dog to the SPCA.   dogs are work...it takes TIME to care for a dog, she's not a toy, she's not a cute little THING that sits and looks cute for you. she NEEDS your time. give it to her, or find someone that will.    EDITED:  then YOUR the one that needs to be tapped! since YOU don't get it. that is called NEGATIVE training..ask ANY dog trainer. grow up!|`|31158bc52a61a1292ced49abe58c3317aa	First, don't spank.     Second, she's 5 months old - her world is play-time and you're her favourite toy. She's also begging to be taught, to communicate with you and you're not listening to her speak. You need to take some obedience classes and learn how to train your dog and communicate properly with her.    Take her out for long walks - do things that tire her out. She has excess energy, she needs to get rid of it. Take her to the dog park. Take her places where she can expend all that puppy energy. Get a chuck-it and teach her how to play fetch in the park, keep her running until she gets tired. Do it before you go to bed, then you should get some sleep. All dogs need a good hour of exercise a day to be comfortable. Some need more than that. You need to find out how much energy she has and then expend it.     That's why she bites, she just has all this pent up energy, so she's going to try to get your attention because she needs SOMETHING to do....    Remember, a tired dog is a happy dog. :)    Finally, people are giving you very good answers - we're just not giving you an instant fix or condoning your spanking your dog. We're giving you the truth.     The reality is, if you're not ready or willing to put the time in with your dog, you shouldn't have it. There are tons of people that would love to take care of your 5 month old puppy.|`|af74d67a19fcb11578cb0fd97f94bde3aa	Dachshunds are very stubborn, they require patience, persistence, and love to be trained.  Do not ever hit your dog.  At 5mo. that dog should be going outside most of the time, I am sure mine went to the bathroom outside by that age, we had a few accidents after that.  We bought a crate at Petsmart to keep this last one in at night, because he would keep us awake at night .  I did not need that with my first two as they slept quietly on my bed.  You need a dog training book or a class.  Dogs should be trained with positive reinforcement (treats and praise).  Dogs that age need to chew a lot, provide things to chew on and keep other things out of the way. ( Mine chewed up my glasses when he was six months old, he jumped up on a table and ran off with them).  I taught mine not to chew my hands by saying no with a stern voice and offering a chew toy to chew on.  Set aside 30minutes two or three times a day to play fetch  with your dog and put her in the crate when you need some time to do homework and stuff.  It is a great safe place to keep the dog for some time out, until the dog gets older and calms down.  Do not keep a dog crated all day long though.  The good thing about crate training is it helps if the dog is ever sick.  My Vet said to keep a dog recovering from surgery still for two days and it is really hard with out a crate.  Trying to get her not to bark is another story.  Dachshunds bark!  They are good watch dogs for that reason.  We tell ours hush and pet him and he will, unless it is people at the door and then we can not calm him at all.  He is being the protector he is.  With training and understanding  you can have a great friend and loyal watch dog.  It takes work.|`|AA10362084	How do u train it? here's how, put ur dog up for sale or give it to a shelter.

Your puppy is certainly becoming the queen as you say. Please don't ever spank your puppy.       There's no doubt that the first few weeks with a new puppy can be exasperating. That tiny bundle of fur that was soooo friendly at the kennel, the pet store, or the animal shelter has some behaviors that drive you crazy. These behaviors are normal for puppies but are to the point of getting out of hand. What matters is that the house training go smoothly and relatively quickly, that the nipping and barking, and accidents be held to a minimum.    For housebreaking it would help to get a pen for her if you don't have one. Don't let her have the run of the house until she is is housebroken. Puppies usually go shortly after waking up, eating, and playing. There are sooo many websites that deal with puppy training and will tell you in great detail how to deal with all the problems that concern you.     You must tell yourself  that  you are going to devote the next few months in housebreaking, and training your puppy so that you will have a nice happy well trained dog that you can be proud of.     Take her to a puppy training  class. These classes are great for socializing your puppy and training you how to train your puppy.

Cadeia alimentar ou trfica  a maneira de expressar as rela??es de alimenta??o entre os organismos de uma comunidade, iniciando-se nos produtores e passando pelos herbvoros, predadores e decompositores, por esta ordem. Ao longo da cadeia alimentar h uma transferncia de energia e de nutrientes, sempre no sentido dos produtores para os decompositores. No entanto, a transferncia de nutrientes fecha-se com o retorno dos nutrientes aos produtores, possibilitado pelos decompositores que transformam a matria organica em compostos mais simples, pelo que falamos de um ciclo de transferncia de nutrientes. A energia, por outro lado,  utilizada por todos os seres que se inserem na cadeia alimentar para sustentar as suas fun??es, n?o sendo reaproveitvel. Esse processo  conhecido pelos ecologistas como fluxo de energia.    A posi??o que cada um ocupa na cadeia alimentar  um nvel hierrquico que os classifica entre produtores (como as plantas), consumidores (como os animais) e decompositores (fungos e bactrias).    Porque frequentemente cada organismo se alimenta de mais de um tipo de animais ou plantas, as rela??es alimentares (tambm conhecidas por rela??es trficas) tornam-se mais complexas, dando origem a redes ou teias alimentares, em que as diferentes cadeias alimentares se inter-relacionam|`|9dd3a55e4b99a8df2e1d1b669c35b637aa	Chiiii !! vem l di lonj?o.mai bem di lonj?o memo.UAi !!|`|020e635b7de3abd66f0ee46eb622b51baa	La de casa|`|AA12103599	O cheiro...o gato n?o gosta do c?o porque o c?o tem um odor forte e o c?o n?o gosta do gato porque o gato tbm tem um cheiro forte (no olfato deles,n?o no nosso)...

Segundo a lei da evolu??o das espcies, formulada por Darwin, todos os organismos se originam de outros mais primitivos por meio de muta??es genticas. Apoiado nessa teoria, Dcio Altimari, geneticista da Santa Casa de S?o Paulo, afirma: A galinha, tal como a conhecemos, teve de surgir antes que pudesse p?r o primeiro ovo. Ela deriva de um animal menos evoludo, provavelmente tambm uma ave. Somente depois de se desenvolver  que um organismo pode se reproduzir.    J Francisco Mauro Fauzano, geneticista do Instituto de Biocincias da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, acredita na hiptese contrria, porque a galinha n?o teria como botar seu primeiro ovo sem ter nascido de um.

Add ground up cuttlebones to their feed when they are molting as the extra calcium will help them to build a strong new exoskeleton.|`|c362ed5b9997f5118fdeecf48a81b142aa	you!!|`|e88a073468fc75ffa278f40f55e2e203aa	hermit crabs eat, because they need fuel to survive just like all other living creatures. you need to eat dont you?|`|AA10467519	Care of the tree crab includes daily feeding and watering. A commercial food from a pet store is sufficient, however you may supplement the diet with fresh fruits and veggies, but you should make sure not to leave un-eaten fruits or veggies in the tank for more than 24 hours. In addition to drinking water, hermit crabs also need to be sprinkled daily with luke warm water to keep them from drying out. Mist from a spray bottle filled with lukewarm water works well. Keep the tank temperature between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. About once a month you should remove all the gravel from the crabarium, rinse it well without soap and let dry before returning it back to the crabarium; this will remove non eaten food, and waste.|`|29ec6394821e99613460db15778e7787aa	PLease do not offer commercial foods if you want your hermit crab to live a long and healthy life with little complications.

You want to take into consideration if his skin is sensitive, if you've had problems in the past, things like that. If you're not sure but desperate, you could try a small diluted dabble on his paw, and watch to see if because red or itchy.    I think that if you dilute either of the two shampoos down (though I've heard lots of people using Pantene for all the vitamins it has.), not by a lot, just enough so it's not thick anymore, and avoid his face, then it should be fine. We've used human shampoo on our small dogs before and they didn't have a problem with it.

Tambin se tienen reportes y avistamientos en el condado de Calaveras, California. Fue avistado por primera vez en la dcada de 1960 en los andes Bolivianos, y lleg a alcanzar la popularidad en la dcada de 1990, se lleg a utilizar su imagen para el dise?o de camisetas, llaveros y diversos artculos tursticos.

La descripcin popular de esa entidad es que sera una criatura peque?a (de 1 m de altura o menor tama?o), que presentara piel verdusca y escamosa, ojos grandes y saltones, y cabeza ovalada. Esta vaga descripcin coincide con otro ser de la mitologa contempornea, los peque?os seres aliengenas grises. Tambin se le atribuye un rostro canino de grandes ojos y colmillos y tobillos largos como los de un canguro. Adems, presentara una estructura corporal humanoide un tanto encorvada con una hilera de espinas dorsales y a veces se le otorgan un par de alas similares al murcilago que sobresalen en su lomo. Poseera afilados colmillos y se dice que tambin tendra una especie de filamento bucal que succiona la sangre de sus vctimas (y en ocasiones sus rganos). Adems poseera garras como extremidades.    Las descripciones de esta criatura varan, y nadie ha producido evidencia indisputable de su existencia, aunque hay gran variedad de anomalas animales halladas en las dos Amricas.    [editar]  Caractersticas de los ataques  Los animales muertos, presuntamente por el ataque del chupacabra, no presentan sangre en sus cuerpos y presentaran como heridas un solo agujero; a diferencia de otros depredadores que en su mayora, destrozan el cadver.   Comnmente ningn animal reacciona alarmado o presentan algn tipo de resistencia. ejemplos: Due?os comnmente no reportan ruidos extra?os, y ni siquiera ladridos de perros guardianes de sus animales; es ms, los canes al ser observados posteriormente, reaccionan de forma muy extra?a, y en algunos casos asustados.   Se indica comnmente la falta de huellas del animal atacante, o si se presentan son escasas; similares a las de un canido de gran tama?o, algunas de las cuales presentan una prolongacin en forma de taln. Tambin llama la atencin que estas pisadas se encuentran a diferentes distancias (4 a 5 metros), indicando que poseeran una gran habilidad para saltar.   Comnmente no hay testigos directos de los ataques.   La mayora de los ataques que no corresponden a estas caractersticas, normalmente luego de una investigacin, corresponden a ataques de algn tipo de animal nativo o introducido en la zona del ataque (es el caso de los ratones hocicudos como el hocicudo rojizo que atacaran a los animales peque?os, o los perros); o ataques falsos de origen humano (normalmente para hacerse famosos).    [editar]  Teoras relacionadas con su probable origen  Algunas teoras a favor de su probable origen son las siguientes:    Animal "no clasificado" por la ciencia; por lo que debe ser estudiado por la criptozoologa.   Una entidad extraterrestre (o un fallido experimento biolgico extraterrestre en algunas teoras), que lleg por accidente o deliberadamente a localidades rurales en muchos lugares de amrica; por lo que debe ser estudiado por la ufologa.   Entidad demonaca que fue liberada en la tierra, posiblemente como castigo de los pecados humanos; por lo que debe ser estudiado por la demonologa.   Experimento cientfico humano.   Una teora en contra de su probable origen, pero no de los ataques, es la siguiente:    Los animales han sido muertos por un animal conocido como puede ser el Oxymycterus akodontius u otras especies de ratones hocicudos; perro, gatos, etc.   [editar]  Historia  [editar]  Comienzo de la leyenda  La leyenda del Chupacabras, comenz alrededor 1992, cuando los peridicos de Puerto Rico, El Vocero y El Nuevo Da, comenzaron a divulgar las matanzas de muchos tipos de animales diversos, tales como pjaros, caballos, y cabras. En ese tiempo era conocido como El Vampiro de Moca puesto que algunas de las primeras matanzas ocurrieron en la peque?a ciudad de Moca. Mientras que al principio se sospecho que las matanzas fueron hechas aleatoriamente por algunos miembros de un culto satnico, eventualmente estas matanzas se comenzaron a dar alrededor de la isla, y muchas granjas divulgaron prdidas de vida animal. Las matanzas tenan un patrn en comn: cada uno de los animales encontrados muertos tenan uno o dos agujeros pinchados alrededor de sus cuellos.    Algunos supuestos testigos reportaron avistar una figura peque?a color verde oscuro, alrededor de las reas de las matanzas, dando a los reporteros y la polica, la sensacin de que los chupacabras podan, en hecho, ser una figura extraterrestre; comenzando de esta forma la idea popular de que se tratara de una entidad aliengena.

AA11706151	Small dogs are a lot more of a pain and harder to train than big dogs.    My all-time favorite mid-sized dog for kids is the English (or Welsh) Springer Spaniel. They require some grooming, but don't shed or bark too much, are generally great with kids and easy to train. Females are a little bit easier than males, but either should make a terrific pet. They will need a good thirty minute walk every day.    Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and  ENGLISH Cocker Spaniels (NOT American!) are great too and need less exercise. They are small, sweet and quiet.     Vizslas, Setters, Labs and Goldens are usually great with kids but they're bigger and are very boisterous until they are about two. Labs shed a LOT.     http://www.akc.org/breeds/english_spring...  http://www.akc.org/breederinfo/breeder_s...    http://www.akc.org/breeds/rescue.cfm    I'd also suggest reading some really good books on training. Try not to do it randomly - there are a lot of bad books out there also! These are some of my favorites and you can get them on Amazon.com  What All Good Dogs Should Know - Volhard  Good Owners, Great Dogs - Brian Kilcommins  Dog Tricks : Eighty-Eight Challenging Activities for Your Dog from World-Class Trainers by Haggerty and Benjamin  Don't Shoot the Dog - Pryor  Training Your Dog: The Step by Step Method - Volhard  Dog Problems - Benjamin  Cesar's Way - Cesar Millan    Also, watch the Dog Whisperer on the National Geographic Channel. Cesar Millan is the best trainer I've ever seen on TV.     Whatever breed of puppy you decide on DON'T go to a pet shop or buy one off the internet!!!! You'll pay top dollar for what is usually a poor quality puppy mill dog. And you'll be supporting one of the cruelest industries in the country. The breeding animals are kept in deplorable conditions. They probably haven't been vaccinated against contagious diseases or tested for any health or temperament problems or genetic diseases - that costs money and cuts into their profits. A female is often bred every time she comes into heat. When her poor little body can't take it any more, she is often clubbed in the head and tossed into a dumpster or an open ditch. Most puppy mills ship their pups to pet stores at wholesale prices and many pups die before they even get there. These "breeders" have figured out that they can use the internet to ship a dog directly to the customer and thus make more money by cutting out the middleman. If you buy a dog from out of state, good luck getting your money back if there's something wrong with the pup. These people count on you becoming instantly attached to the poor little guy and being willing to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars at the vet to treat whatever is wrong with him.    Find a good breeder by going to www.akc.org or talking to people at dog shows. You can also find info about the breed clubs on the akc site - they probably have a rescue group where you can get an older dog for less money.     Find a breed rescue organization by going to www.akc.org - you can get an older dog for less money. Be VERY careful about getting a shelter dog for a family. You are often adopting someone else's problem dog. And people often lie about the dog's temperament, hoping he'll get a new home that can deal with him.|`|AA10240949	bulldog, none better!|`|c75034bd34bae3ee2010647546321307aa	hmm...I had a fox terrier once. He was really quiet. It may just be him but it also might be the breed. They're medium size dogs if that's okay. If you want, you can look up on them and other breeds. I think you'll find something!    Good Luck with your new dog!|`|6357c8fd5f6b6e90e7b7274b4ec4527faa	"Mickey" is wrong, not every dog barks. Most of the wolf-type dogs (Samoyeds, Huskies, etc) howl over barking. They can be quite vocal however, and obviously large and with a thick heavy coat. Your best bet would be to get a Basenji. They are small dogs with perked ears, a shorthaired coat, white and red fur and a tail that curls over their back. They don't bark. They may make a short barking sound, but will not continually bark like almost all other breeds. They are obviously capable of making all other doggie sounds... whining etc. However, the Basenji may be expensive or not readily available. I guess the best thing to do would be to have a look around. Great dogs, I've heard, and low maintenance. They can be stubborn though, so if you get one, take him/her to obedience classes or you're going to need a lot of patience!    Anyway, good luck and have fun with whatever breed of dog you choose!|`|0b6583ec9240396f522cdb402d083c71aa	Toy Yorkshire Terrior, there so sweet|`|49d47890b32cb5dda727434fff1a7bc5aa	Good luck finding a dog that dont bark.

And there are more questions to be asked. Do you want a hyper dog? Cause most small dogs are. Chihuahua, Dachshund, JRT, Yorkies...etc. Look until some, learn about the breed. Decide which one fits you best.     Good luck.    electricarizona    When I said all dogs bark, I mean in general. They make some sort of barking sound (I count howling in this)! How many breeds of dog do not make one sound whats so ever. Maybe a dog from the breed, but not a breed of the dog. I own Shelties, Shelties are big time barkers - but I have met Shelties that do not bark at all! My point is when you go for a breed you don't know when it may or may not bark. I was trying to be helpful, I'm sorry, Jesus.|`|ce4123327ce83977cce6f308773a1d07aa	I have found Dachshunds to be very good for young and new pet owners because they are fairly quiet, sweet and easy to take care of.  I had a sweetheart of a Dachshund named Inky who passed away on March 10, 2004.  He was able to travel everywhere with me and he was a sweet and loyal companion.

They can be nice pets as well as help guard your home....but if your parents are welling to help you with the dog while you are not home I would suggest a small dog because they will take up less room in the house...I would go with something like a Pomeranian, which is what I used to have, they are very smart and learn fast! If you are going for inside dog, I would suggest a female dog and get her fixed to avoid her  being in heat...house male dogs tend to spray, some can still spray after being fixed....    Mickey has a good point! Most small dogs do tend to be MORE hyper and bark a LOT...my pom was VERY hyper, he was called the barking bush...anytime he was let outside he would run under the bushes and bark nonstop...I don't see where he was able to draw in more air to keep barking.... but he was good tempered and learned fasted. but NO, not ALL dogs bark a lot....that just depends on how hyper the dog is...and really you will not be able to tell that until the dog is over a year old...simply because all PUPPIES are gonna bark...thats the baby in them...so really you won't know at first if he will bark a lot or not...|`|AA11717943	actually mickey u are wrong not all dog bark , do u know miniature schnauzer would bark always, i have a miniature schnauzer, it only bark to greet me home another than it won't bark, u can consider having a miniature schnauzer. u can check this website for more information http://www.petrix.com/dogint/1-10.html
7325448094acf489bb8a345ca814e462aa	Totally depends on the ferret...just like some dogs are mean and not good with kids, same with ferrets.  Ordinarily, they're very sweet animals.    Problem with kids is that ferrets aren't all that durable and are alsways under your feet...and most of them are sock-junkies and will ambush you when you walk by them in socks, etc...point being, if you step on/fall on/kick a ferret, you will really hurt them, bad.  Depending on the age of the kids, this could really be a factor.    I've had a bunch of ferrets, only one was ever mean for no reason, most of them wouldn't bite or scratch if their lives depended on it and just loved to roll around and give kisses.  They sleep like 18 hours a day, but tend to make lots of noise at night when you're trying to sleep.  Also, most wire cages aren't designed for ferrets so you need to get ones from a ferret store rather than the idiots who work at (insert big name pet store here) who have no clue.  Never put them in a glass tank designed for mice/fish/snakes/etc.    Like all pets, they're a lot more work than you initially think they're gonna be, but can be very rewarding.    If you're really interested, do NOT buy a ferret from a big pet store.  They sometimes end up getting pretty sick, and vet bills on ferrets can be murderous.  Go to a ferret rescue.  They're cheaper, healthier, have all their shots and stuff, and the people can tell you all about their personality and disposition...something that the pet store can't do.    Washing your ferret once a week?!?!  Ferrets have a natural musk to them and the oils are essential for their skin.  Washing them all the time makes them smell better, but is really not healthy for them.  You need to look into a thing called a DRY BATH.  It's like crushed walnut shells or something in a bag.  You put the ferret in the bag up to his neck, then you rub it around on him.  They love it and think it's play, and it washed them without being harmful and stripping their oils.|`|2f99cf76d030b46405faf276e4d95865aa	yes they are very playful and active just like anything else depends on thier moods and feeding. they are somewhat close to cats|`|AA11334957	It largely depends on the age of the child and his/her personality, but generally speaking "NO". They are not. I wouldn't get kids and ferts together until they are at least teenagers and then be prepared to do all of the work yourself, from scooping the litter twice daily, to cleaning the whole cage out weekly, to spending 3-4 hours daily playing, because ferrets need human interaction to be properly socialized. Don't think teenagers, most of them anyway, are up to that. They are busy being teenagers.   Most answerers here have made valid points on the subject, so I won't repeat them, but I have to add that bathing a ferret once a week is NOT a good thing to do. It strips the oils from their skin, making them itch which in turn makes their oil glands go into overdrive and as a result you'll have a smellier ferret sooner. Bathe them once a month or less unless they got into something.|`|29db648a315e748f2d51d3358d1f755caa	i dont think there good for children bc i wanted to see one when i was little and they said "theyll bite or something"|`|7924d2a299bd48625c93558cd3f45a75aa	No they are not...they are hyper, they bite, and they can be skitish...I used to babysit for a family that had two ferrets....seriously-it was the only job in my life I ever quit!!!!  The kids were terribly naughty!!!! And I had to watch the ferrets too, they are a bit mischevies....But I suppose that if your kids are well behaved, you may have better luck than I did....Ferrets are great if ya live on your own...Personaly, if I were to get a pet for my kids, it would be more along the lines of a dog, cat, or goldfish!  :)|`|0c668855de14186084a4e006f1e02732aa	I actually had a ferret and I also have 2 children.  All in all they are funny to watch and my children loved her but I don't think they make good pets for a child.  They are thieves and steal everything shiny...then they hide the stuff and it is hard to find because they get into everything.  If you really want a great pet around kids try a guinea pig.  They are very affectionate and you can even walk them on leashes.  They are easy to take care of too.|`|77e7d322b93b4cb6d8138a505598cb34aa	I have 5 small children all under the age of 9. I have fish, 3 birds, a cat, and a FERRET. My kids love the ferret and I think the ferret was a great addition to our family.   They are very funny little creatures, very curious and playful. I think having a ferret is just like having a cat or a dog. All animals will respond to their environment and how they are raised and trained. Ferrets need to be litter trained. ( we keep our litter box in his cage since he's only allowed out for a portion of the day)  My youngest child is three years old and carries the ferret all over the house and curls up with it to watch t.v just like it was a cat. Ferrets need to be trained how to act when they are being held and when it is play time. They are very active and snoopy. We got ours when it was only six weeks old and I think made it a little easier to train.  If your children are very little they would need to understand not to sqeeze it too hard and just common sence things.  As for the smell, if it is bathed about once a week you will hardly notice a smell. It's a regulation that ferrets be fixed and descented before you buy them if you get them from a pet store. ( at least in pa)  Hope this helps|`|AA10953561	Ferrets play hard and have sharp teeth. They can be trained but it's hard. If you have older children who understand that it can and probably will bite then you don't have anything to worry about, but I certainly wouldn't leave a ferret in a room alone with a three year old, if you know what I mean. You can always train the kids and the ferret together. What I love about ferrets are that they are actually very neat. They pick a corner of their cage and that's where they potty. You should bathe them once a week in luke warm water and dry them as soon as your done. Good luck!|`|AA10356572	some do bite.. it depends on the age of the kids.. really other than fish there is no "good" pets for kids.. it is a question of how good the kids are for the pets...|`|82bce41e90ec1a1ebe71a56d61363b42aa	They tend to be nippers.

Yo tengo dos perros, un pastor velga en el patio de mi casa, y un chihuahe?o en el interior de mi casa.    Un dia que tuvimos que salir fuera de la ciudad por una semana los dejamos alos dos solos y solo habia manera de comunicarse debajo de la puerta que hay una rendija de 4 cms de alto. Pues cuando regresamos, nuestro perro chihuahue?o que era peque?o habia aprendido durante este tiempo a hacer cosas que el pastor aleman hacia constantemente, y el nunc ahabia hecho, al igual que el pastor aleman habia parendido a subirse a las sillas de el patio para dejar que lo acariciaran.    Esto puede ser casualidad o no, pero estoy segura de que los dos al verse solitos aprendieron a  que realmente no estan solos, y ahora cada ma?ana el perro chihuahue?o lo que hace es al levantarse, sacar la cabeza por la rendija d el puerta y el pastor aleman siempre esta en la ma?ana al pie de  la puerta esperando que la otra haga eso, y los dos sin ladrar mueven la cola como si se entendieran y se dieran lso buenos dias cada dia en se?al de amistad.

They can teach you how to teach your dog to stop kicking your butt. lol They can also teach you how to teach your dog other things as well. A good class to start with would be puppy class, or household1.  Don't stop with just one class, you wouldn't take your child out of school after kindergarten, would you? Good luck.|`|AA11434771	is your dog really that tall if you take him to get traind or maby be nice to him he will stop|`|26efd9c48c4f3c106381f5652f9dec89aa	Stimply was on the right track. If you're putting yourself in a situation where he can keep doing that, then stop.     What do you mean beating you? Our dog will wave his paws at us when he's laying down and he wants more belly rubbing or wants to play. But the only way he would make contact in the face is if we were close.    Your dog needs to learn to stop that. The first step is to stop putting your face so close to him that he can do that. But if you feel the need to do that anyway, when he does "punch" correct him with a quick and firm yank at his collar and a sound that he knows to mean "no."     The Dog Whisperer also uses a quick finger jab to the dog's neck to simulate the bite of another dog. (He says that the dominant dog will bite -- not to break the skin, just a way of saying "hey, you stop that" -- other dogs.) We use that with our dog when he jumps against the fence or starts to growl and you can see him enter a submissive state right away. It's not a punch. Just simulate like a "vulcan grip" and quickly and firmly poke his neck. Not too hard though. You'll see if you're doing it right because your dog should look like he's giving in to you and being submissive.     If you're not sure what I mean by all of this, check out the dog whisperer on the national geographic channel.|`|AA11433153	GIVE IT UP 2 HIM..LOL    BY THE LOOKS, SOUNDS LIKE HE ALSO WNATS  A PEACE  OF UR ...

Just be consistant and he'll learn sooner or later what is expected of him in that kind of situation and cease the act.  My big dog does something similar. she hops up, socks in the stomach with both paws then lands on all fours.  Cute but painful! You just have to catch all problem behavior and NEW problem behavior in the act so they can learn what is wrong and be corrected. Good Luck!|`|AA10730751	dont get on his level, he takes that as a challenge. you needs to make sure he knows YOUR boss.|`|411b4074e1f3f23e6c476bdda6c2f7d2aa	I don't know...BE NICE TO HIM MAYBE???Just maybe....|`|1067f1889e243665c6a3e4cb0af73c58aa	If your dog is punching you like a kangaroo tell him to stop you have every right to yell at your dog, you're the boss of him. Make sure that he plays with you. Your dog needs attention, that's why he won't stop beating you. He's controlling you. Sometimes, you're better off putting your dog just to keep you and everyone else in the house safe from the dog. I'm sorry, but it's the only way to do, if your dog keeps treating you like that.|`|6df4a239d95fc2414ab467e9c4d9d1d8aa	Forget that stuff about being "nice" to your dog. Giving him treats and hugs won't change anything. Teach him how to respect you by firm but calm. Behave like a leader not a punching bag.  Watch "Dog Whisperer" for tips.

197ed71d27d43023c6a66b10f05fcd8daa	Hola!  Yo personalmente creo que es algo muy propio de los animales y que no hay que buscarle 3 pies al gato buecando motivos pero en fin, ah te va una informacin que encontr:    Podrian ser tres las causas:    1) Estenosis lumbosacral.  El sntoma ms comn es dolor, que puede ocurrir en el lomo, en una o las dos patas traseras o en la cola. El perro a veces tiene dificultad para levantarse pero una vez que lo hace y empieza a caminar se le ve muy normal. Puede tener dificultad al orinar o defecar porque le causa dolor. Muchos perros no pueden mover la cola o les duele si la mueven, entonces lo evitan. Algunos se muerden el rea plvica o la cola creando un da?o considerable ya que se la mutilan solos de tanto morderla.  Para el diagnstico se hace un examen fsico en que el veterinario mueve tanto patas y cola para ver si duele. Tambin se hacen rayo x para evaluar la espina y la pelvis.   Dependiendo de la severidad de la condicin, se trata con o sin ciruga.  Sin Ciruga: Se trata con antiinflamatorios como prednisona.    2) La Diskospondylitis:  Es una infeccin por bacterias u hongos que afecta las vrtebras y los discos intervertebrales (que estn alojados desde la nuca hasta el final de la cola), la infeccin da como resultado inflamacin; a veces deformacin en esas vrtebras..., lo que hace que el perro tema mover la cola; y en algunos casos se la muerde como loco y se la lastima.   Se diagnostica con test de sangre, urinarios y rayos x.    3) Aburrimiento o strees:  Quiz el animal pasa mucho tiempo solo y recibe pocos paseos, lo que podra ser otra de las causas de este hbito, lo mismo que el nerviosismo o stress segn opinin de algunos veterinarios.    Saludos!|`|168e6155ab83426860264e2ce51f490daa	No s   ?ser que la cola no puede morder al perro?|`|58c923d3d758863fcc445e2b25e5c136aa	Digamos que es casi normal, pero a veces lo hacen porque tienen parsitos.|`|59f63fd12214fb98af95b2ac22ecb0c2aa	es por curiosidad cuando estan en la edad de explorar todo o tienen ganas de jugar.|`|866492885883b4dfe409e4ed47429de5aa	Pq estan aburridos, asi como tambien muerden todo!!|`|ed4bdf454a2fd777b94524a7c179ad9daa	Porque les pica.|`|5a1d20f742ddaeb70a7f5723b89900d8aa	POR LAS PULGAS DEBE SER, APARTE ALGUNOS LO TOMAN COMO JUEGO..|`|16b0cf573604bd78665f67a8e1fa2b65aa	Por que ahi tienen sitiadas a las pulgas|`|8a434a1908e35af4b96da08ac6d8db47aa	es como un juego para ellos, segn me cuentan como ellos ven que la cola se mueve y todo tratan de morder por esa razn lo hacen ... es divertido verlos ... verdad????|`|AA10739578	Porque les pica, y no se la pueden rascar.|`|699196ccdffb25f07a8d4c85790f928baa	Por que les pican las pulgas y como no tienen manos que mejor que la trompa.|`|3da3e62f85d7927cb3de3ced20199fd0aa	cuando los perros giran sobre si para morderse la cola , es porque estn stresados. es verdad, me lo ha explicado un mdico veterinario. los animales tambin se estresan igual que los seres humanos. los gatos por ejemplo son animales muy  estresados, y   ?los loros ? sabian que cuando se mueren es por causa de un susto ?, ...|`|0315c799d5232e1bc06dcd4e7cec20b1aa	Porque la cola no puede morder al perro.|`|22ce8e0f7a489a92cd1c218341bd6f77aa	aburrido!  comprale unos juguetitos lo suficientes fuertes para que no los rompa rapidamente|`|18f839dc743e98b6b1eed222d8cdebf3aa	responden al legado de sus ancetros los lobos que giran aullando, antes de acostarse, es  un rito de verse que alli estan|`|d6f96bcd3746fe4901a864878c6db116aa	Se la muerden porque las garrapatas y pulgas se la pican|`|2358ab78e099b3b1044293ab1c3ce423aa	Por que alli se le acumulan las pulgas y garrapatas.  http://espanol.answers.yahoo.com/questio...|`|148aa32021921552b2ed5f3994f047a3aa	Para oler su trasero (Los perros huelen los traseros de otros perros)|`|fb215d2f64ce3880f725884596309003aa	Sera que le da curiosidad tal vez.

Anzeiche fr Koliken sind : St?hnen, w?lzen, schwitzen, sich nach dem Bauch umschauen, unter den Bauch schlagen, breitbeiniges Stehen.

Herding dogs, however, don't (or shouldn't) follow through with the kill.  Many other breeds exhibit various forms of prey drive.  For example a Jack Russell Terrier may chase sheep around a round pen like a young, inexperienced Border Collie - but they clearly don't have the ability or talent to become a herding dog.   Thus herding instinct is much more than prey instinct and includes a number of inherent behavioral traits that allow a dog to effectively work stock.   Basically anything that the dog does naturally in working stock can be thought of as being part of their instinct.  This includes, gathering/heading behavior, eyeing, balance, wearing, pace, flanking, and a number of other responses to stock. Many of these aspects of instinct are not apparent on initial exposure of a dog to stock and can only be evaluated with training and careful observation in different situations on stock.|`|c0871d54c683b513e97f1e4d1b8d4029aa	They try to steer the herd of cattle or whatever. Used in the old days. Keep in mind it is an instinct. The dog will always try to do it, especially with kids or other dogs. Basically when anyone is running they get right in the way and try to trip them. Annoying!|`|AA12136244	It's the natural inclination to herd or try to chase an object. That object can be a child, sheep, cows, whatever. Border Collies are an excellent example of herding instinct as are Australian Cattle dogs. Any dog with this instinct is going to be very active and require lots of mental stimulation or some sort of job to do.

Noch dazu besitzten sie einen sensiblen Tastsinn !|`|f22d9ef2d82335c7181ed33bd317454faa	Spinnen k?nnen ber ihren Tastsinn Vibrationen wahrnehmen:    Zu den Sinnesorganen geh?rt das lyriforme Organ zur Erkennung von Vibrationen. Das Organ findet sich an den Spinnenbeinen und besteht aus mehreren parallelen und unterschiedlich langen Spalten in der Exokutikula. Jeder Spalt endet in eine zylindrische Vertiefung (Kopplungszylinder) ber den mittels eines Dendriten eine Sinneszelle gekoppelt wird. Spinnen k?nnen ber das lyriforme Organ Netz- und Bodenvibrationen wahrnehmen und sie dienen wenigstens bei einigen Arten als Propriorezeptoren und somit der Orientierung und sind meist in Gelenkn?he platziert.    Obwohl mit den lyraformen Organen auch Schall wahrgenommen wird, sind die Becherhaare (Trichobothrien) fr die akustische Wahrnehmung wichtiger. Das Frequenzoptimum liegt bei 300 bis 700 Hz, reicht aber bei Luftschwingungen zwischen 100 und 2.500 Hz. Die Vibrationen oder Schallkr?fte verengen die Spalten und l?sen so einen Reiz auf die Dendritenspitze aus. Schallwellen versetzen die Becherhaare in Schwingung, die auf dendritische Endigungen bertragen werden. Die Bewegungen des Haares werden mit Sinneszellen wahrgenommen, die auf drei verschiedene Auslenkungsrichtungen ansprechen.|`|584963add8ebd0205b4a9e715c25679faa	Wenn ja sind der Spinne die ich gerade aufgesaugt habe die Ohren im Staubsaugerrohr abgefallen.|`|f2743009bda338ae6ead7ba07f2c5f1eaa	wie kommst  du drauf, da? spinnen ohren haben ?|`|b6aa4ab8bcaeb778a25d9c62939173c0aa	nein haben keine ohren

Its very hard to say from here without photos or anything. If it is an allergy, a vet can usually give a shot and/or a steroid like prednisone. I would look for the moments that it seems to aggrevate him/her the most (like see if he/she itches alot when its on the carpet or in its bed or on its blanket or whatever the case may be. Take him to a vet though if you havent yet. You do need to rule out any medical problems.Allergies can make a pooch very miserable!!

Isso pode fazer com que a pele e a pelagem se tornem secas. Baixa umidade pode contribuir para uma pelagem seca, quebradi?a e perda de plos. Manter o c?o dentro de casa, onde a umidade  sempre baixa, freqentemente leva a problemas desta natureza.   Uma alimenta??o desregrada tambm pode levar  perda de plo.

200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	Did the right thing by thinking of his health. However, do not just shove it off just because someone said don't worry about it. That is their opinion. Not a fact.     The only time you are to listen is if a vet said it is common to not worry about it. Those people could of easily felt it was just a bad air day or too much dust. With out even examining the horse at that.    If you suspect something doesn't seem right with your horse, investigate it.     1) Take temperature. Know your horse's normal temperature morning, during the day at at night. Know his resting v.s non resting temperature.    If it is above his normal resting and he hasn't moved around a lot, suspect a low or high (depending on how high it is) fever. which is a sign of infection.    2) Take pulse.  Is he breathing fast, shallow, deep? Congestive? Too quick of breath with flaring nostrils?  Listen with your ear at the heart girth area to hear any raspy or deep when he coughs. Just as a doctor would with a human to hear the lungs.    3) Has he been eating and drinking normally? Feces liquified or very solid?    4) Is there any other horses showing any signs of infection or previously been sick?  What did they have and what vet saw them?    Knowing those things and recording them will also help your vet have previous documentation you gave to determine the onset of this occurring, plus narrowing down the issue by listing the on-going/on-coming symptoms.    My gelding had strangles and pretty much this was the start of it. If that is the case, you have to quarantine the whole place. Not allowing a horse to come in or out to help not spread the virus. Even though it is airborne, it will help decrease other horses from being infected. Your vet will explain that into detail if your horse has strangles. If he doesn't have a knot in-between his jaw (main location drainage occurs), I would not get too worried on it.     However, my older gelding was coughing and discharging, which pretty much was bad air quality with a "summer cold".  Not too much of a big deal. An anti biotic and supplements. Then making sure dust and dirt is settled down.    This infection can mean quite a few things, which you have to wait for the vet to give the accurate diagnoses.|`|AA12080854	your horse has bronchitis. the treatment is the same as for people, rest and medication depending on the cause. don't worry, he'll be fine. :-) if he sneezes often, he might be allergic to something. you might want to check that out because allergies could predipose him for respiratory problems, i.e. lead go him getting bronchitis more often.|`|bbc949c5da91284944168153007bea96aa	ill be ok|`|8c2af394d710eb7143a4e45f4e3fcea7aa	Has the horse been off of your property lately, or have any new horses been in contact with him?  If so he could very easily have Strangles (aka shipping fever).  Does he have a lump between his jaw?  If so, then he is just beginning to get sick.  He is VERY contagious, so don't take him off your farm unless you have to for vet work.  His gland will swell, and eventually (hopefully) will burst and drain.  He will also have a lot of discharge from his nose, and a cough.  The good news is once he's had it he will never get it again, and it's more inconvenient than anything.      As far as treating it goes, it depends on you and your horse.  We had our entire barn infected a few years back, and we made the mistake of using antibiotics.  It actually drove the infection into their chests and made it dormant, and months later they were swelling and draining again.  My suggestion, and what I have done with every horse since then, is to just let the infection run it's course.  It helps to keep them out on pasture too, not just cooped up in a stall all the time.|`|028ad9d480fc68f385114678e79e62b9aa	I would get rid of the people telling your not to worry about it. If you have a feeling there is a real problem. Do not trust others, They do not love or care for the animal the same way you do. The others on here are most likely right antibotics should do the trick and rest. But please don't listen to others if you feel uncomfortable get it checked out. They are not there for the animal. They are there for the paycheck and if something should happen what do they have to lose?  Good luck|`|1c39bf77ac87396c5071c1fbe5253f31aa	Your horse probably has an upper respiratory infection. Although he may feel yucky for several days, with rest and antibiotics, he should be fine. If the horse has strangles, he will have swelling at the throat latch area. He will also be very sluggish and you can typically easily tell that the horse is not feeling well. Antibiotics are usually not recommended for this affliction but if your vet wants him to be on them, so be it. There are several reasons a horse may cough and that alone (an occasional cough) is generally no cause for concern. But a horse that coughs often should be carefully monitored. If you do not know how to check your horse's vital signs, ask your trainer or the barn owner to check them. If they do not know how, move to another barn. When your vet is there, ask him/her to teach you how to take a horses vital signs and what is typically considered normal. Keep in mind that exercise or being out in the heat can affect these signs. It is always good to take your horse's vital signs several times when you know the horse has been resting and is in good health, to help determine what is normal for your horse.|`|a9bf99d4c00e4321b91be5e5ae0bfb04aa	My horse did this once, my vet put her on antibiotics that I crushed up and put in her feed.  Be sure that the people where you are boarding do that for you if you are not there to do it yourself.  I crushed the medicine up and put the exact dosage in plastic zip lock bags to make it easy for the stable keepers to administer.      Your should be fine.  Plenty of water, medicine and rest should do the trick.      Good Luck and Take Care.|`|bbf320869380ad5fd2daaf8b28754ad2aa	Could be a cold, could be a sinus infection.

AA10290570	I just went through the same thing.  It started with my outdoor cat accidentally being brought to a shelter because someone thought he was a stray.  Fortunately, he had a tag and the shelter called me the next morning to come get him.  Unfortunately, a few days after he came back home, he started sneezing in repeated bursts about 4-5 times in a row.      I took him to the vet when it didn't get better after two days.  The vet examined him and took his temperature.  He had a fever as well.  The doctor did describe it as an Upper Respiratory Infection (URI).  She said there could be several different causes but that it was most likely either bacterial or viral.  She prescribed a twice daily dose of Amoxcil droplets (she gave me them during the visit).  She also recommended using Children's Benadryl in liquid form to ease the symptoms for a few days.  She recommended 0.5mg per pound of the cat's weight.  I went to Walgreens and found out the conversion from mg to ml.  For my 10 pound cat, it worked out to be 2ml, which is very small.  I'm telling you this because if you do this, ask for your vet's opinion and don't attempt to administer this yourself without help.  Too much can hurt the cat.    Lastly, even though my other indoor cats had their vaccinations last year, they ended up contracting the same thing anyway.  I tried keeping them seperate, but this is an airborne infection from the sneezing.      I would recommend taking your cat to the vet to determine exactly what is wrong and ask if your other cats are at risk.  It's better to be safe than sorry.  Since there is no white or yellow discharge, it's a good sign it's not likely one of the more serious diseases, and that the cat will get better soon with antibiotics.  Good luck!|`|AA11533114	It might be a cold. I dont know. But you should be wworried.

AraBfesHaa	Well hello Mrs Pepper pot,  I never heard of a gibbicep so I googled it to see what it was.  lol.  It's just a polka dotted pleco, right?  That's what it looks like.  (It's so cute, just l like all plecos!!!)  It could have already been starving when you got it if it's belly was sunken in.  If they're still hungry after you feed them, they'll scrounge around the tank looking for something to eat.  They're voracious eaters.  If the other two were bigger than him, maybe they were beating it to the food.  It also might just not have gotten over the stress of being moved.  (You don't have salt in the tank do you?  They don't tolerate salt)  It could have just been sickly or had a disease when you bought it also, so watch for a little while and make sure the others stay healthy looking, in case it had something contageous.  And you know the common can grow to 2' long, so it needs a very big tank, right?  Be careful with the fruits.  I'm always afraid the fruit juice will mess up the tank water.  Apples I'm sure are fine since they're not juicy anyway, but for that reason I've never tried giving them fruits.      They eat more at night than the day, I'm sure you know that.  If they are leaving food that you can see in the morning, they've eaten all they want for that meal anyway.    I'm sure they'll be all right,  Katie :)|`|vvJBtxXHaa	...polkas and zebras are both fascinating to me as well    ...if you are feeding wafers and veggies, the little guy is in hog heaven  ...i like to present pieces of zuccinni for them too...my plecs seem to enjoy those immensely  ...if you are really into the whole veggie thingy, a little product known as a cucumber screw is sold that can hold a nice sized piece of zuccinni on the bottom while the plec eats it's fill, then it is simple to remove too    ...i never tried kiwi, yet..thanks for the suggestion  ...i enjoy plecs with various fish types, such as a fantail goldfish  ...if fish eat every other day they are receiving plenty of food   ....as you may know, tropicals and goldfish alike can easily survive 2 weeks without any food at all...particularly in cooler water without interruptions, or agitation  ...since they are cold blooded they can slow their metabolism on command for survival   ...so if we feed 2 to 3 times weekly, that really is alot for the fish..... but , is it enough for us???? hehehe, we must discipline ourselves, yea? not to overfeed the fishies? hehe, my kids love to sprinkle the flakes and see the fish come running...and well, I just love to see them smile too, sooo, we feed them a smorgasboard of fun|`|H4rPbnV2aa	You sound like a very caring owner  I'm sure your fish were well fed and fine  Sometimes they are born with an illness such as a tumour just like people.

Cfk1kr8Daa	Chronic recurring ear infections are a sure sign of a food allergy.   Top allergens are beef, corn, chicken, wheat, soy and dairy - but any dog can be allergic to any food...     Try Nutro Natural Choice lamb & rice formula - sometimes it;s that easy... transfer him over just three kibble per day, and wait another week to see if things start to calm down.  It can be even slower than that, but you should see a bit of improvement soon.      Otehr possibilities include the Wellness line of foods, they have a completely grain-free line, and many allergy dogs do well on their Atlantic whitefish and sweetpotato kibble.  But the allergy is your underlying cause - I'm sure of it.      In the meantime, try Zymox Otic for his ears - it needs to be used alone, but is very soothing and will kill just about everything that could be growing in there - it's just glycerine, zinc and enzymes.  You should find they clear up in a few days at the most, and it's safe to use all the time.|`|giCUEYsJaa	You Jack Russel has "cocker ears" - which basically means his ears are always "wet" and never have a chance to dry out.     Take him back to the Vets, get him panalog ointment (antibiotic, yellow in color) use 2 x a day and clean his ears out with "OtiRinse" Ear Cleansing/Drying Solution every morning before 1st treatment.    Your Vet should have some - if not, you can purchase online.    Once the infection is gone, use the "OtiRinse", once a day for additional week, then reduce down to 4 x a week, etc. until you're only using 1 x a week.   You will no doubt have to do this forever.    REMEMBER:  always put cotton balls in his ears before bathing, and treat with "OtiRinse" immediately after his bath.    If he swims in a pool, lake, pond - use the "OtiRinse".      DISCLAIMER:  I do not sell this product, I have terriers with same ear problem and know it works!  Has saved me $$$ on Vet Bills.    Good Luck!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Have you tried adjusting her diet?  See if you can find a food without corn or corn meal.    I own a Toy Poodle, and every couple days I'm cleaning her ears.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	Most of the time you can't.  Just take good car of her ears- clean them out everyday.  I co-own a Pit Bull with the same problem- and his is never an easy fix.|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	Unfortunately if may not be possible to get rid of it permanently.  Infections usually start at the outer ear ( ear canal ) and if they get into the middle ear from there they can become chronic.  Maybe try a second vet's opinion for options or other possible medications or if it could be a food allergy?|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I would get a 2nd opinion next time to be certain your dog doesn't have a deeper infection. You can read this link about chronic yeast ear infections & how to prevent & treat. Just click on the left side for different options.    http://www.dogearyeastinfection.com/what...    You should find help in reading this but still get  a 2nd opinion.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	You probably won't be able to get rid of it "once and for all."  It is important to clean her ears once daily while you are treating an ear infection (before you put the medicine in).  But when she doesn't have an infection that is being treated with medication you NEED to be sure to clean her ears to help reduce the likely hood of her developing an ear infection.  Commercially available ear cleaners (you can get them at any pet store, your vet, or probably even the pet aisle at your local grocery store or super box store) will alter the pH in the ear canal so that the environment is less favorable for yeast and bacteria to grow.  Most dogs with chronic ear problems should have their ears cleaned at LEAST once a week, although if her ears are particularly bad she may need it as often as every two or three days to stay on top of things.  By cleaning her ears often you are not only going to make infections less likely, but you will also notice when (not if) her ears are starting to become infected (there will be more "gunk" in her ears when you are cleaning and it will look different from the normal dirt that you get) and you can start treating the infection sooner...which will mean less pain for her.    Another thing you need to do is take a close look at her food.  Dogs with allergies and food intolerances tend to have chronic skin and ear infections.  Corn, wheat, and soy are the most common allergens, although a dog could have a problem with any ingredient.  If your dog's food contains any corn, wheat, or soy then you should seriously consider switching to a food that has none of these ingredients.  If she has sensitivities to any of these ingredients eliminating them from her diet will reduce the frequency of her ear infections.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I have dogs that were getting this quite iften also as they have the floppy ears..When I switched to a all natural diet this all went away,I feed them Halo only found at Petco.If you clean the ears with the solution once a week when you have it under control this should keep it at bay..But you have to be consistent,write it down that every sunday you will wash the ear and see if this helps|`|SfUM9ZOcaa	rinse his/her aid with viniger ounce a month this should kill most growing bacteria
3891fcebb566f7370dbbd6418e15f386aa	If it's the manual type gravel cleaner, you will need to siphon it to get the water to start flowing.  Then you will use quick up and down motions over the gravel to remove the debris from under the gravel.  The water goes quickly so you will need to cover as much of the bottom of the tank as you can in a quick amount of time or you will end up with half of the tank water gone.|`|vvJBtxXHaa	the syphon type vaccum is easy, and takes a little practice to clean quickly  it will remove a lot of water rapidly, so the vaccum must be moved around efficiently and quickly  ...get a 5-gallon bucket  ...place the big tube in teh tank   ..hold the attached hose lower than the level of the tube  ...suck water from the tank into the hose!!!  ...once you see water coming half-way STOP sucking on it and hold the hose into the bucket..  ...the water should begin flowing on it's own, then move the tube around  ...vaccum around 1/3 to 1/2 the tank each time you clean  ...alternate areas each time you clean to keep each part vaccumed   ...change 15% to 20% of water each week, by vaccuming    I added the links so you can tell us if these are the same type of vaccum you have received ....  Cheers!|`|tShDXmgbaa	What you are seeing after disturbing the debris is normal. It should clear up in a few days if you actually were able to siphon water out of the tank.  The easiest way to use the siphon is to dunk the siphon end down in the tank and let it fill with water.  While the tube in is in the bucket, lift the siphon end just out of the water. As soon as water starts pouring in the bucket,quickly dunk the siphon end back down into the tank.  The siphon should now be sucking water out of the tank,through the siphon and into the bucket. The 2 parts of the siphon you have is a complete siphon device.|`|AraBfesHaa	She's right, and yes, you have all the parts.  All it is, is a plastic hose with the "long see through thing", which of course is the end that goes in the water.
TD5DKXT2aa	Hi :)    I suggest that you don't clip them. The nails are so small that you might cut the nerve in it. They usually wear down with time or the activities that they do.This is what I would do.. line the inside of their wheel with sand paper When it runs it wears down their nails. Sand paper is not bad for the hamster. I would also just suggest taking him to the vet were they can do it with out hurting him or putting him in pain or stress in any kind of way. If you try and do it your hamster could become depressed or stressed. But if you think you can do it try the sand paper first. But if that does not work try these!  http://www.petco.com/product/105557/Mars...    Good luck!  ?Hamsterlover?|`|elY5vkVyaa	http://www.petwebsite.com/hamsters/hamst...|`|AA11297919	Make sure if you do decide to it yourself, that you have someone else support him/you support him and someone else does it. On nails, there is the pink stuff and then the white stuff. Don't cut alot at a time, just little by little or else you will hit the pink stuff which has nerves in. Though it is usually best to get a vet to do this for you. But some hamster breeds naturally have longer nails, and male hamsters usually have longer nails than girls.    Another way to wear his nails down naturally is to give him something to scratch his nails on.    Here's a useful guide:  http://www.ehow.com/how_4422823_trim-ham...|`|6qsocyK3aa	Do you really trust a bunch of strangers on the Internet?

Raise some money for it, make some stuff and sell it or help out at you next door neighbours for a little bit.
XurYYreBaa	Give your rats, or @ least Koda, more playtime outside the cage if possible.  Many people  use a bathroom as a free range area, just make sure the rats can't squeeze under the door.  Make the play space interesting with boxes & things to climb to encourage activity. Male rats tend to be less active than females but they'll move around more if things are interesting enough.  If you feed your guys a packaged mix, remove the dried corn & sunflower seeds before giving it to them.  Dried corn is unhealthy for them anyway & sunflower seeds are high in fat & best used as treats. Offer a bit more fresh veggies & cut down on fruit.|`|I3W8Yt5gaa	http://www.petsmart.com/search/index.jsp...  use any of these diets for Koda    Don't be worried about Koda, Kenai needs help .one of my rats takes the other rats food so she is so skinny. my old rat gracey died cause the other rat takes her food.take kenai out while koda is exercising and feed it by hand strawberries, bananas, cream sheese ( they lick it from your finger) sunflowerseeds, rice cakes, frozen peas and okra, ect.|`|qGy9fR7xaa	I had that problem, too! I had one female rat who was tiny when we got her, but she's so chubby! She used to eat the same as my other female rat, but was pretty fat! In the end, i just watched them when i gave them a treat, and made sure if one stole it off the other, just take it off her! Or maybe feed them in separate parts of the cage.  What you could do it while you're giving one rat it's treat in the cage, hold the other, until the first is finished eating, then do the same for the second rat.  What i did to help my rat loose weight, was put her in one of those rat balls. She didn't like it at all, first, but soon began to enjoy running around. Plus, if you don't already have one of those excersize wheels in the cage, i'd get one!  ~Good luck!! |`|CvLwS9p5aa	when giving Kenai his treats, take him out his cage so Koda can't get at Kenai's treats and take them away from him.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Make a little run or a maze for him to exercise in.|`|rwYL9H8Uaa	My Rat skittles has become fat like your buddy. I take him out now and make him walk around for a while. Making him work for his treats, or just giving him fruits and veggies are one method. Seeds and nuts are full of essential oils that are quite good for them. Don't give him foods with trans fats (partly hydrogenated oils) like Doritos, and avoid saturated fats. Although my rat is fat they are cute this way lol. Good luck :)|`|yJqXmy8Caa	cut down on:    sunflower seeds    nuts    bannanna chips|`|J4sheVDmaa	I am wondering how old your rats are? I had a wonderful pet rat ScatRat. Rats were something new to me but I would have another she was so sweet and affectionate. She would sleep in my hair. But I noticed she was getting fat so I took her to the vet and found out she had a huge tumor in her abdomen. My vet said tumors are very common in older rats. It may be a good idea to get your rat checked out by a vet. Good luck I hope it is just a weight problem.|`|daa680251e1ac5c7e34e280c16168adaaa	some rats can become extremely lethargic. when my rat got obese I let them run together around a rat safe room for a few hours everyday.  Fresh vegetables also help|`|7slHq9n2aa	I would not give them treats as much. Rats will eat anything just because it is in front of them whether they are hungry or not. and most of the time even if you see that their food is all gone you should not feed them right away again. Get a structured feeding time everyday. Because the rats will store their food in the cage somewhere if they cant eat it right then and there. Especially if there is more than one rat.  I had a very fat rat and that is what the vet told me.|`|XT4MPPewaa	seperate them when giving them treats, cut down how much you feed koda if you can, give them excercise, puzzles such as climbing ropes etc.|`|GfgeZN1Laa	I think everyone has pretty much solved your problem, but I just wanted to add: don't give Koda any sunflower seeds or nuts. They are VERY high in fat and oils which means that even healthy-sized rats should only have them Occasionally!
AA12083992	Many of us put our dogs on a leash and walk them. A nice long walk every day, morning and evening, with a pee break or two in between.|`|nGkCWpRVaa	next door|`|psnaJcvpaa	I am sorry to sound harsh..but if you are thinking of having a dog..then you must be prepared to take it out for walks at the very least twice a day, no 'if's' or 'buts'. It is essential for their well-being, not just because he needs to go to the toilet. If you have a concreted garden,then this is more the reason to take him out for walks.    I have a neighbor who has a dog,and the poor thing is left indoors alone nearly everyday and all day with out being taken out for walks.This is unfair and cruel to the dog and I can hear him barking and whining and it's not very nice to hear that. He's desperate to go out. My neighbor can't be bothered with him.    You obviously need to do more research and think very hard before taking on a dog. If you also have a full time job and a busy social life, then I should think about getting a different kind of pet.     Dogs are a big responsibility and it's people like this who give the RSPCA a lot of work to do...    I am very sorry if this answer is harsh., You can tell I feel strongly about this.( I am sure you might be a great dog owner when you get him) but  I was just trying to make you see what life is like for some dogs. The novelty of having a dog wears off after a while and just don't want you to make a bad choice.. Dogs are not novelties.|`|AA11097657	Dogs like to go toilet at the bottom of a garden away from the house.  My dogs any many of my friends dogs like to go on gravel.    You could use bricks to make an area at the bottom of your garden and fill it with gravel.    If you don't fancy that idea then leaving your garden just as concrete would be fine. Mine don't mind going on slabs but it is harder to pick up any runny poops!    A dog flap is a great idea and one with a lock is a must.  You don't want your dog out during the night barking at the stars!|`|9kTejB0uaa	If they have no alternative, dogs will do their business on concrete - I put mine through quarantine, and their runs were totally concrete, so they had, sadly, no option.  They survived.  And actually, much as it's far nicer to think they have a grassy garden to run free in, at least you can hose concrete down and disinfect, and the pee doesn't burn the grass.    However, once a dog is old enough, most people actually take their dogs out for a walk  lol!!  Problem solved.  (Please pick up after your dog has gone in a public place)    PS  While it might seem that a dog flap is a good idea, dogs who have access to the outside in their owners' absence get stolen!   And what goes out, can get in (the unwanted) .  Personally I don't think they are such a hot idea.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	it should go outside on the concrete. my dogs do, and if they have a wee, i just wsh it away. if your in the house with him you will need to keep a constant eye on him if he is a puppy. if you get a dog that is already house trained, just leave the back door open for him, make sure your actually in the house when you do this. i do that with my dogs, and when they need the toilet they just go outside|`|ofUe4hBkaa	i hope your going to be taking it for about 3 walks a day, two at least.  so theres 3 times it can go, then i tend to let my dogs have a roam around in betwen each walk in the garden where they can do there business.|`|eO429roGaa	You're supposed to walk them.|`|e689cde0c9392593f9c414564377d6d9aa	1.

I have four cats and one of mine whines continously in the morning when we get up.  See my husband has spoiled him by giving him a saucer of milk when he gets up and made a habit out of it.)  I don't think he is adicted to milk just is spoiled and wants it and has gotten into this routine.  I have always given my cats cat nip and have never saw any evidence of it harming them.  Now give some cat nip to your bratt before she drives you totally nuts.|`|f1b10a87f3a387fa448120e0e4ac1005aa	I called a vet friend of mine about your question (it sounded so funny).    She says yes, cats can have susbtance abuse issues (typicaly physical withdrawal symptoms from a medication).    In the case of catnip cats can develop a psychological addiction, but this is not common.  Most cats love the stuff, but aren't addicted.    The best way to help your cat is cold turkey (total withdrawal from catnip).  Do not introduce catnip again into your cat's environment or the problem will start all over again.  It may be rough for 7 to 30 days, but the cat will stop.    Best of luck to you.|`|5d066dce5c9897e016a51927a2fe8ec9aa	No that will be wrong!    Cats r very addicted to catnip, so there is nothing you can do except:    put it on your hand to pet it wit  rub it on the food bowl so it can eat    Well basiclly rub it on everything so you can do wat eva wit it|`|d07fab5037e9cbe36ad592502675a685aa	Yes, mine are addicted to cat nip, they need the 12 step program called.Cat Nip Anonymous.|`|de80830fc285f1be6d071e2cc102cbd3aa	Well he may be addicted to it. Ween him off it just like a human I suppose. It may be more of a behavioral problem. He has figured out that crying and meowing will have a favorable ending. Ask your vet who your local animal behavioral specialist is and see how she recommends dealing with the problem.|`|824cf20ac9afab200fa70ace25a4cc7daa	My understanding is that catnip is addictive to cats.|`|a33f00f37e8f675d69b88d3598405315aa	Yes. I don't think they have one of those...Maybe you can start one and make a bunch of money off of it?  ^^^Look, you have a lot of potential clients! Good Luck!
Ct7dHq92aa	Any two males will attempt to mark their territory. YOU have to make them not want to mark at all. The easy fixes are:     1- Keep both outside in a pen.  2- Put one outside and keep one in.  3- Neuter both, fixing just one will not work in this situation.  4- Take a class on dog training to learn how to control your animals.          Right now both think they are the alpha dog and are saying so. You have to step up and be in control, aka become the alpha dog in your pack.   5- Read one of Cesar Milan's books on dog training.  6- Consider they are simply peeing in the house due to lack of supervision.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Yes, sweetie, they need to be fixed.|`|AA12128656	have you considered NEUTERING and HOUSEBREAKING your dogs? that's DISGUSTING.    i have 3 unaltered males, and they wouldn't DARE piss in my house- because it's UNACCEPTABLE! train your dogs!    start like they are puppies- don't let them out of your sight unless they're confined to a crate. these dogs don't deserve to run loose.  CORRECT them when they lift their leg in the house! since you're not going to let them out of your sight, you can catch them EVERY time!    and clean up the old pee with Nature's Miracle or some other enzyme cleaner.|`|W0buucLsaa	Neutering them is a good start. My parents neutered one of their dogs when he was TEN YEARS OLD and it curbed his marking.    It may or may not stop it completely, but it'll make it a heck of a lot easier for you to train them out of it.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	First step would be to neuter them- that will cut back on the urge to mark.  Now that they have been doing it, however, it is a habit that needs to be chance.  After they are neutered, get into some serious training- this would involve crate training and a "outside every hour" schedule.|`|qioH81tiaa	Keep them on short leashes.  Keep them in the same room as you.  Keep an eye on them.  When they START to mark, a swift and severe leash correction, each and every time.      Too much work?  Then get them neutered.    Oh, and clean the areas well with an enzyme-based cleaner.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	As others have said, neutering would help.  But it won't solve the problem outright as it has clearly become a habit by now.      You need to thoroughly clean the ares where they have already urinated with an enzymatic cleaner.  Then, if at all possible block their access to that area.  For example, if they are urinating on the back corner of a particular chair move that chair into a corner up against the wall so that they can not get to the corner they normally mark.  If it's a particular spot on the carpet, cover that spot with an ottoman, coffee table, etc.    As others have pointed out, these dogs clearly have not earned the privilege of having run of the house.  You can not allow them to be loose unsupervised at all.  If you can't be right there watching them then you need to confine them to their crates or a small easily cleaned dog-proofed room.  Keeping them on a leash is a great way to keep them right by you when you are home and they are out and about.    Consider purchasing a belly band for each of them.  Belly bands are usually sold wherever you can buy doggie panties/diapers for female dogs in heat.  It's a simple wrap that goes around the dog's waist and covers their penis.  If they pee with the band on, it is collected in an absorbent pad and doesn't soil your house.  For many dogs it will actually deter them from marking because they don't like the wet feeling they will get (although not all dogs are bothered by this and you will need to be sure to keep them as clean and dry as possible to avoid skin problems).|`|3p6wp7DYaa	NEUTER THEM.
t85b6QMiaa	The original purpose of creating an aquarium is to preserve species in their natural habitat so one can learn their nature. So in the common sense, I must say that it is a feasible idea.    Even though this species can tolerate freshwater, it is better to keep it in the condition where you caught it. This way, you can learn about them much more better and it'll make them happier.     Good Luck.|`|RkcWRQb3aa	it is possible but very hard.  You have to start with water from their original habitat and then slowly change over to the water  you are going to use. also you have to make sure you have enough room for them to grow. The other issue lies in weather or not they will eat food you have. Make sure you research what they eat first.|`|lMSAyTm6aa	we used to do it all the time in hawaii :)  start off with the water you catch them in , then do 25% water changes with store salt mix as you go. make sure to get some rocks and stuff as well. ( we never got coral though, and we just got some babies from the tide pools)   we also used to go catch crappies in lakes ( on the mainland US) and put them in our freshwater tank. Those were pretty fun too!
AA12136244	Wow my head hurts with all the information you ask!!   Training: It's always best to have someone help you hands on with this especially with your first dog. Look in your phone book for your local kennel club as they will be able to either help or direct you to someone who can help you. Puppy classes are good even for people like myself because it's a great way to help socialize your new baby.  Make CERTAIN you go to a good, trust worthy breeder and they will be able to help you with food. You should always feed high quality food of coarse, with a Lab you will want to get off of puppy pretty quickly as it can cause them to grow too quickly which will compromise their bone structure. Feed twice a day (never free feed especially with a Labrador) and three times a day when she's a baby. I think a little snack before bed is fine although not necessary when older.   Potty training: Never EVER EVER rub his/her nose in it. If someone says to stay clear of them because their philosophy of dogs is WRONG. If you catch your puppy urinating/defecating in the house a stern NO and take her outside to finish. Put a word to it ("Go potty" etc.) so she knows what you want.   You may want to clicker train her. I think it's the best idea around. See the net for more info (Google it).  Feeding raw meat is a great idea. It's something that is very confusing though. I think feeding a high quality food and supplementing it with raw bones and meat 3-4 times a week and also giving raw BLENDED veggies works well.   There was something else I wanted to put down but I can't remember it now!!! Sorry!! If you have any questions let me know. You can contact me by clicking on my name.  Depending on where you are check AKCs web site for a breeder in your area. That doesnt always mean they are a good breeder but you can weed through the BYBs a lot better like that. A good breeder will know about health problems in the breed, should certify eyes, hips, and elbows. Make sure they have done this and know what the numbers mean. Someone who shows will always have better quality dogs than someone who just bred their pets. Hope thats some help. Enjoy your new baby. Id love to see pics when you get her!!!  Edit: I REMEMBERED!!! lol  I feel that male dogs get along better with women and bitches with men. Just something I've observed over the years.  And Labs are very smart. Anyone who says they aren't has bought from a bad breeder. Why else would they be used to guide the BLIND? But I'm biased too :-)  Edit2.0: Grapes, raisins, chocolate, milk, avocados, onions, garlic, all things to avoid giving any dog. Chicken bones are fine as long as they are NOT COOKED. Cooked they become brittle and can puncture the stomach or intestines.|`|4cef7c0127f6a74fec5a23da509e8f00aa	I dont know where you live but if you have a petco go there they can help you with everything.good luck|`|01ef0137587ead6164d9d3f4a67ef386aa	Get an already trained one from the pound and save a life.|`|debd9c746580dbc944784f9038b27ce7aa	It's great that you're looking into things before getting the dog.   You should look into obedience classes around your area and find out how much they charge, what they teach and if it includes socialization classes. A good age to start obedience classes is 12 - 16 weeks.   You don't want to over feed the Labrador as they can get over-weight/obese very easily. You should get premium dog food (Science Diet is great - read the label to see how much to feed and how many times per day) or even better, get him on a raw diet. You can check up what a raw diet consists of on the Internet (http://www.google.com).  There are MANY foods to avoid, some are: chicken bones, chocolate, grapes and raisins, onions, garlic, milk and dairy products, fruit and potatoes.   House breaking Labs is usually fairly easy as they are very smart dogs. I would not suggest crate training but a lot of people think it works. Taking the puppy out every 2-3 hours and saying 'POTTY' or 'POOP' (or whatever you want to say), stay out for 15 minutes and praise puppy if he does the right thing. 'GOOD BOY(/girl)' will be good.     There are many websites to find information about the breed, what to feed the breed, grooming, temperament etc.    *****EDIT: Please, PLEASE make sure you buy one from a reputable breeder who screens their dogs for hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia and PRA (eye disease, leads to blindness).******|`|AA11826043	http://www.akc.org/breeds/labrador_retri...    http://www.canismajor.com/dog/labrador.h...    http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/health/...    http://www.akc.org/future_dog_owner/abou...    http://www.akc.org/public_education/resp...    http://www.thelabradorclub.com/    http://www.thelabradorclub.com/breeders/    http://www.tristatevets.com/dog/dogspupp...    http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...    www.dogfoodproject.com        Here is a load of websites, all helpful and informative.  I suggest you talk to a number of breeders first since this is your first dog.  A Labrador is a great choice, although they are high-energy working dogs, so you need to be prepared to offer him a lot of activity.      Have fun and it is great to hear someone preparing and learning before they bring the dog home.  Kudos to you:)|`|8316f2c0b3dd2c9b2ab2919e119b2266aa	Ok the Eunkenba Kennel Club has great advice for new dog parents, For feed just leave the dog dish full unless the dog eats it all then probably 2 to 4 times a day, aviod chocolates and choclate products, its better just not to feed the dog table scraps. And start out with puppy chow dog foods.|`|76dde1b710c52536f8d64b5a453374d6aa	Careful with labs!  Yes, they are great dogs, but sometimes first time owners get more than they bargan for.  They need LOTS of room to run and exercise daily! Yellow Lab Males have a tendency to get REAL big REAL fast and aren't the brightest...I would reccomend a female black lab for starters...Working at the shelter I've seen so many great labs come through...but the females only show up when ther owners don't want to deal with them in their senior years!  Talk to your vet about what kind of dog might be good for you.     Another option might be to adopt an older dog from a shelter.  They don't require quite as much attention as a puppy and are more forgiving!  I'm not suggesting a senior citizen, but maybe one that is already 3 or 4 years old...Puppies are a lot of work, even good puppies and then you would be able to get some practice at being a good dog mum...you can always get a puppy after a year or 2 with the older dog!      I adopted an older german shepard from the shelter that I work at and she has been the light of my life!  She would have been a hard placement because of her size and the fact that she's nearly 8 years old!  But we've bonded so well and I wouldn't trade her for the world!  Rescue dogs, even older ones, seem to know when they've been saved!    I could never go to a pet store or even to a breeder when I know first hand how many great dogs are out there in shelter, waiting for homes.!     If you go onto petfinder.org you can search rescues and other shelter organizations for your perfect family pet by breed, size, or age!!!  Its a really great site!  Good Luck!|`|45d9f2a981ab15139a3efacbff8c8990aa	The site below is a great site! They info upon info, they have a Q&A forum, they have tips on just about everything, from training to grooming, behavior problems to physical problems, ect. I love this site! They should be able to help you choose the right type of breed for you.    Or if the first site doesn't help much, try the second one.    I had 2 black lab pups, and they were a handful! But we lived in a 1 bedroom apt, and the pups were abanonded. They are supposed to be great dogs for families. Good around children, easy to train, smart, and protective, but not agressive, unless they feel threatened. I can tell you this though, this is with any dog, but it's alot easier to train if you get them as a puppy. And make sure you teach them who the ''pack leader'' is, quickly in the relationship. This will make things so much easier for you in the long run. Let the dog know that they are at the bottom of the chain, but no less important. You don't want the dog to be like mine, listens to ONLY you, and will only let you take care of it, and take it outside! lol It's quite a pain in the rear!!|`|d66150deb607d766b44323e3d56e82e9aa	hi. im so glad u decided to get the info  before getting your dog. the right match w/person & dog is the BEST!  each breed has it's own pros & cons...& a good breeder or rescue group can tell u what they are. i read everything i could find & went to a few dog shows....& asked TONS of questions before i found the breed for me. a lab is generally a pretty high energy pup.....will this fit in w/your lifestyle? any new dog...& its proper training will take a BIG committment of time.....i'd highly recommend at least basic puppy training class for him once you get him.   i know that yahoo has groups devoted to many breeds, i bet people there would be willing to help direct you as to training ,the specifics of the breed, lab rescue groups & even good breeders.  i wish  you the best of luck & many happy years w/your new pal!|`|f8a3e1916a1358a55f2e47b7e870da88aa	first you can find a great dog that really needs you at www.petfinder.com  put in your zip and search under labrador.  you can also put in age, size, and sex.  as for your other questions before you buy the dog, call a training center that you plan on taking your dog to and ask them what book they would reccomend you read before getting a dog.  read the book.  find a vet, call them and ask them when they reccomend vet visits, what vaccines and when.. take your dog there.  plan time for walks and play, and you should have a wonderful friend for years to come.
eae3ee012ab50fad98c9b83f97ef2212aa	hello, sounds like your little guy has swim bladder problems. the best way to fix that is feed him peas. feed it to him atleast once a day. stop feeding the other foods. once he is better offer him peas a few times a week. also provide fresh vegetables and fruit to him on a daily basis. make sure to change his water once a week and your little guy will be better in no time. good luck with him!..jewels|`|AA11279875	It's hard to say.  He could be sick and is simply finding a place to hide.    Are there other hiding spots in the tank?  How big is the tank and what else is in the tank?    How often do you do water changes, and have you had your water tested lately?    It's a good sign that he is eating normally, but typically most goldfish don't hide like that unless they are sick or are being picked on by other fish.|`|410b06f56b4160baef435c7ade19f121aa	Fish may not be a big deal to some, but others out there keep them as prized pets.

There is a thread constantly goin on disease and diagnosis.  Post in the 911 section and give as many details as you can for your issue.

Fish arent a big deal. And they only cost 28 cents.
AA11334957	Calm down, this stuff happens for different reasons. Ferrets will chew on things and ingest small particles of items not intended for consumption. Sometimes their bodies will attempt to get rid of foreign matter on their own and that will change the consistency of their stools.   Here's what I have done in your situation and it's worked both times I did that:  I watched my ferret closely. As long as she was acting normally there wasn't anything to worry about just yet. Just make sure she eats and drinks.  I gave my Vicky a larger than usual dose of FerretLax and another the next morning(I usually only give it once or twice a week) and again in the afternoon. I also let her munch on some turkey baby food, though it wasn't really necessary.   She never did act sick and the stools normalized on their own. I did call my vet and he just told me to watch her closely and bring her in as soon as she changed her behavior in any way.  My oldest male had similar symtoms and I treated him that way and after a day and a half he passed a bright pink piece of plastic he had chewed off of a pen.   So, it's most likely not Green Slime. You can still take her in to be seen by your vet tomorrow, just to be on the safe side.|`|AA10055682	If she's eating, drinking and playing, I wouldn't worry too much other than to keep an eye on her.  The biggest risk with these little troublemakers is that they eat something that causes an intestinal blockage.  Just having irregular poops may not be a big deal, but keep an eye on it to see if it continues or gets worse.|`|a62ed0eee583afc54803b423831fa203aa	why don't you call a vet instead of asking a medical question to random people on a website.  i could say, hey, your ferret is fine.  are you going to believe me?|`|6767d45256c4f8619229f64c6cdeda39aa	Look here please, this is an awesome sight when there stools are odd, http://www.miamiferret.org/fhc/scoop.htm     Good Luck!|`|65034e87ee563a94fc04a1757f4246b0aa	try giving her different food, and see what happens. I got a dog over the summer, who was also very skinny, and had diarrhea, and died of a disease called polvo, i think. But your bunny only had it today, so i would give it a little more time, and see how she gets along. Then, if you still have the problem, yes, see a vet.|`|89f54cf4a75b1272692c2dc2672732f2aa	ok i answered your last  ? but in light of this ? don't panic and start force feeding(every couple of hours i think it is 30 cc but those sites will tell you) stuff like pedilyte(or if you hve it the marsalls ferret aid) and some baby food(i use gerber stage 2 chicken). before i was like no biggie but NOW IT'S A BIGGIE.  keep her hydrated and give her the vitamins too. keep a close eye on her as ferets will get worse in a matter of hours.  keep trying the emergency clinic or the vet until tomorrow also check those sites i gave you one that has this AWESOME  stuff called duk soup(you might have that already if so use it not baby food) the site gives you a home recipe if you can't find it search "ferret duk soup" yes that is how it is spelled.  if you can't find the info on feeding her search "ferret illness" if you want to you can im me for more i have my im on in my profile|`|df762cb8513b1ad414004f93433a36fbaa	As long as she is drinking I wouldn't panic. The main thing is you do not want her to dehydrate before you go see the vet. Just keep checking her and make sure she is drinking. Keep fluids in her since she loses a lot from diarrhea. Dont worry so much about food, an animal can go for months without food, but without water will surely die. It sounds like she isn't too bad but I cant stretch how IMPORTANT it is to make sure she keeps drinking regularly.  Hope all goes well!!

63439e5b52d40d8694adad7cd7a9c505aa	Rabbits nails are very similar to that of a cat. Although rabbits can be jumpy, If you have done a cats nails before, you should be fine. Before actually try to do it yourself, try holding the rabbit on its side in your lap, if it is jumpy wrap him in a towel with one foot out at a time. If he appears to be calm you should be fine. If the nail is not overly long, just snip off the tip of the nail. I have always just used regular nail clippers, but you can buy nail clippers for rabbits. Most rabbit have clear or whitish nails and you can see the quick. Make sure you don't cut into the quick. Make sure you have quick stop on hand, it will stop the bleeding if a nail is cut too short.     This site might also help  http://islandgems.net/nails.html|`|e64b590936298c188401410556178ebcaa	go to your local pet center and get a set of animal nail clippers and be very careful as they are sharp, or to be safe just go to the vet.|`|ce072ca128f646e7fdc86659f5fd171aaa	Take him to the vet the first time and have him show you how to do it.  It is nice that you can see his quick(vein), but there is a certain angle it should be done at.  Cutting the top of the nail shorter usually works best because they wear the bottom down faster on their own.  I would also buy a quality clipper (vets usually sell them at their clinics).  You want to get one that is appropriate size and of quality to ensure you actually cut the nail, rather than break it off.|`|e7b8b3407029a699134a0dc00d17aa7aaa	For our cat who also has clear nails I use a regular fingernail clippers and just get the tip (I want to leave enough for her to still mouse).  If I recall a rabbits nails are about the same size as a cat's.|`|AA11226298	You can get special clippers to trim the nails with.  The rabbit needs to be comfortable with you holding it, because a struggling rabbit can hurt itself.  Some rabbits will chew their own nails if they get too long, but then you might end up with a few drops of blood on the floor.|`|ca27b7f3591b6a841f37f697b88d5f52aa	I took my bunny to the vet to have his nails done, it only cost 8.00 it was worth every penny, it only took them about a minute,which was less stress on him.|`|039b0eb0b1c0891edda934d370dc8436aa	They have special clippers but I just use our normal nail clippers. It works just effectively for me.|`|8d71b66971d1c7d893ca883d49ed3afbaa	I have a Giant American Chinchilla - larger than a small dog - the first time was tough, but it got easier.  It's a two person job.  First my husband sits with her in his lap, her back resting against his chest.  One hand across her chest and one hand holding her belly.  Be sure to support well because you don't want them wiggling too much.  This exposes all four feet and I use a dog nail clipper thingie.      If you are the least bit unsure about it, take her to a groomer and ask to watch.
21a3590194806a3ba95fbaadaab95b4faa	Io sono contro!  Mha...forse  un po' il mio spirito no global che parla....ma secondo me questa festa non ha senso. Non fa parte della nostra tradizione, prima non si festeggiava mai...ma poi dato che tutto quello che c' negli States va di moda...si festeggia pure qu.  E poi la cosa che mi fa innervosire  che vogliono copiare la festa e non lo fanno  manco bene! In America c' proprio una cultura di Halloween, non si va a ballare nei locali in come qu. In America Halloween significa vestirsi a tema (come da noi a canrevale) e andare casa per casa a dire "dolcetto o scherzetto?", significa horror.   E poi che palle...se continua cos va a finire che ovunque vai ci sono sempre le stesse feste, gli stessi cibi, lo stesso modo di vestire, la stessa mentalit....sono tanto belle le tradizioni! Se continua cos non ci saranno pi differenze...e alla fine il mondo  bello perch  vario...se diventa tutto uguale non c' manco gusto   nel visitarlo. Insomma...che si pensasse pi alla globalizzazione dei diritti dell'uomo che alla globalizzazione delle feste perch dietro le feste ci sono delle tradizioni vere che solo nel paese di origine possono essere espresse al meglio!

Mi metto  con chi ama non essere contro per partito preso. Forse un po' meno luoghi comuni e un po' di conoscenza dell'argomento potrebbero ammorbidire alcune chiusure.  Il 31 ottobre, nlla tradizione anglosassone, rappresenta il giorno in cui vivi e morti coabitano la Terra. Molte le leggende relative a questa data, diverse le usanze e i festeggiamenti.  In questi ultimi anni la festa, all'insegna del mistero, sembra aver preso piede anche da noi, grazie a feste in maschera, horror all'insegna della suspance e del terrore; forse un modo per esorcizzare i nostri peggiori incubi.  Ma tornando indietro nel tempo scopriamo le sue vere origini presso i Celti, popolo dedito all'agricoltura. La fine di ottobre rappresentava la fine dei raccolti, l'inizio del periodo invernale e del nuovo anno agricolo. Era il momento in cui le leggi dello spazio e del tempo sembravano sospese e i morti tornavano sulla Terra.   Bisogna ricordare che il giorno si riteva iniziasse la sera precedente, e non la mattina. Per questo si festeggia il 31 ottobre e non il 1 novembre.  Il nome, per, deriva dalla tradizione cattolica. Questo  il giorno in cui si festeggiano tutti i santi, nessuno escluso. Halloween, infatti, sarebbe l'abbreviazione di All Hallows Even. (Even = sera e Hallows = santi).  E' la sera in cui il  mistero ed il brivido fanno da protagonisti...  Buon divertimento!     Ok per pesciolina04, M U N C H, francesca, Mago Patato! Per divertirsi, la condizione prima  il volerlo fare.

Il punto  che quasi nessuno sa la sua origine e perch si festeggia!     "Le origini di questa festa risalgono all'epoca in cui le isole britanniche erano dominate dalla cultura celtica, prima che l'Europa cadesse sotto il dominio di Roma. L'anno nuovo, allora, cominciava con il 1 novembre, quando i lavori nei campi erano completamente conclusi, il raccolto era al sicuro, ed i contadini potevano finalmente rilassarsi e godersi i doni che gli dei avevano loro concesso. In tale data, quindi, tutte le divinit pagane venivano ricordate ed evocate a titolo di ringraziamento ed auspicio per l'anno entrante; le porte delle dimensioni ultraterrene erano considerate aperte, per quella notte, e tutti gli spiriti erano liberi di vagare sulla terra e di divertirsi insieme agli uomini."|`|c4519497df2faa4207f7adc9e2f76592aa	io sono assolutamente contro   cio nn  1 festa italiana perch noi italiani   dobbiamo festeggiarla?!?!|`|c76c6feebcf601dc3afb56399a2b0f6faa	Io sono Pro (vado contro tendenza!)

FkVMOTZtaa	1) They are loyal, intelligent, brave,strong-willed, they require positive, reward-based training, good socialization and consistency,not the best choice for inexperienced dog owners.  2)They eat regular dog food, or B.A.R.F (Bones And Raw Food)if you want to go natural  3)They thrive in hot climates but can adapt to cooler climates as well.   4)They do need quiet a bit of space & exercise.   5)They have very few health issues and live 10+ years.    Rhodesian Ridge-Back's  can be expensive to buy, they are a wonderful breed, from Africa that were bred for lion hunting.  If your an experienced dog owner than this would be a good choice, they are good for families, you should start them out with kids as a pup.They can run non-stop for 30 miles, so they would be ideal for marathon runners, that being said    they should have at least 1 hour of exercise a day and they must have consistent training.      you should find most if not all your answers here.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodesian_R...|`|AA12128656	they're VERY energetic. and they have a high prey drive.  seriously, for all that general information, you should look up the AKC website and do some research.  they are great dogs though.|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Hyper Hyper Hyper!!!   I have an almost 2 year old Rhodesian Ridgeback/Bloodhound mix...I can tell you about her personality,though I am not sure about a purebred one.I figured with her being a bloodhound mix,she would be somewhat calm-NOT!  Mine is fairly small (35-40lbs) and has LOTS of energy-she never stops running around the house,jumping on furniture,jumping on people and is extremely hard to control/train.She is terrible on a leash and I cannot walk her,she wraps herself around my legs and then tries to pull me down.Though she is extremely intelligent (knows several words and commands),it took me over 11 months to housebreak her,with consistent training every single day.She is ultra hyper,and it's sometimes maddening how wild she acts.She constantly rams her nose into my eye socket when I'm sleeping,which is not cool-though my daughter laughs when she does it.She likes to repeatedly hump by male Bassett's head and face and chews on everything if her chew toys are not in her immediate view.She will jump up on you and scratch your face/chest if you don't remind her to 'get down'.She has many chew toys and will use them,but just the other day she decided to eat the arm of my upholstered living room chair-argh!!!! I live in the midwest and she loves the change of seasons-will play outside forever and loves the snow! She has a huge appetite-almost scary for a dog her size!! She loves to eat cat poop and steals food from the table.She is CONSTANT work to keep in line.Sounds like a lot of work,huh? No,she's not all bad-if you are looking for a dog that will give you unconditional love,this is the one...She is ultra cuddly and very loyal-she follows me from room to room and sleeps under the covers with us @ night.She will be 2 in March and is finally starting to calm down,a little,and become a little more tolerable to live with.My daughter hates her-though she is our baby.I love her with all my heart!  If you feel you are ready for this kind of non-stop activity,then I wish you the best of luck!|`|qI9VCuhZaa	I just watched Dogs 101 about them! They're really active dogs. They need at least an hour of physical activity a day. Other than that I can't remember any unusual care required or any out of the ordinary things that they need, except for the intense exercise.|`|dCzoIUP7aa	They are a wonderful breed, from Africa. They were bred for lion hunting. They are very good in hot climates but are adapted to cooler as well. They have very few health issues and live over 10 years. They eat regular dog food. They do need a good bit of space and exercise. They can run non-stop for 30 miles. They are good for marathon runners. They must have at least 1 hour of exercise a day and they must have consistent training. If you know a thing or two about dogs then it is ok to have one of these. They react well to positive training, not negativity. Good for families if you start them out with kids from a pup. They had them on Animal Planet last night on a show called Dogs 101. Good luck, they can be expensive to buy.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Just remember that they are a ferrrrocious lion killer (wink)  http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/...|`|JAH315Tyaa	I have a Ridge-back and they are very good pets.  I got Gunner when he was 6weeks old.  When i first got him he was very small and puppy clumsy.  Now he is almost 5 months old and getting big (around 40lbs) very slender and tall (2.5').  These dogs are very loving and love to just sit around with you.  They do like to play and exercise.  They will eat everything you give them so you have to be care full not to overfeed.  As far as house training about normal for a dog.  You have to be the dominant person in the house or they will try to take over everything...loll.  I have seen some ridge-backs that were over 14 years old and do well in warmer climates probably since they are very very short haired.  Once you get the training started they are very obedient.  I love these dogs and couldn't imagine a better one.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Also see:    http://www.AKC.org -- Breeds

If you would have read my question you would see that the dog charged me and growled. I never said all Rotts were bad I also had one growing up. You must not have kids telling me to keep my daughter inside. You and your smart *** answer is self centered apparently like you are. Matter of fact my boyfriend shot the dog, so now my daughter can play outside. People like you piss me off, no wonder you dont have your email viewable by the public.|`|AA11730298	they do sometimes|`|AA11853631	No they don't.|`|4b96522cdada9bee2a93669cc4023651aa	First, dogs do NOT have "periods."  They have heat cycles which is a completely different biological process and when they can get pregnant.    Second, once spayed, no more hea cycles, no more isk of uterine and ovarain cancer, no more dog trying to get out to get pregnant and risk dying delivering the mongrel puppies....|`|AA12372794	no they don't
3sB49YNnaa	It is possible that she is pregnant.  Be aware that every successful mating does not result in a fertilization and that males will mount and try to mate with an unreceptive female.  Her behavioral changes could be a sign that she is.  The easiest thing to do is to monitor her weight.  If she is bred, she will start a steady weight gain somewhere between 2 weeks and a month after getting bred.  She will probably start to get sort of pair shaped at about 6 weeks and you will feel the pups moving at 8-9 weeks.    I am assuming that because you did your reading 1) she is neither too old nor too young for a first mating, 2) you are aware that every pregnancy carries the risk of the sow dying and 3) you have plans for the pups if she has more than you want to keep.    I also assume that you know that she needs plenty of fresh water, 18% protein guinea pig chow with stabilized vitamin C, good grass hay and a moderate amount of fresh greens both during her pregnancy and while she is with her pups.|`|PSrIeSP1aa	My lil' girl Malin had 3 babies last year. It is rely hard to know if a piggy is pregnant, because a pregnant animal would be the obvious victim of a hunter(human or animal). Therefore, they're hiding it as best they can, and they're damn good at it. The best thing to do is to take best possibly care of lil' peach. Lots of hay, a little sleeping house, vitamins(you can get special vitamin for pregnant piggies, but since you're unsure, keep a hold on it), enough food and lots of love! In the end of the pregnancy, you can actually feel the little creatures inside there!|`|2b96450180ff61ff28b44093fef66e45aa	Possble.

b2e21fb3e2145a5b4d5c5481962731b2aa	what i always did was  take my puppy outside as often as possible. Maybe every other hour or so, so they will get it in their minds that when they need to use the bathroom, they are suppose to go outside. Everytime they do go outside, award them with hugs, pats on the back, maybe a treat even. Just let them know they did a good thing. This will be tiring. They are like human babies. U will need to do this in the middle of the night also so they can get use to it. They shouldnt take long. Once they get use to it, then they will stay by the door, sit there, hit the doorknob, or whine until u let them out.|`|04763bb84e204ef6d4e377c20ca319cbaa	send her(R)him to school|`|3b8f4787b49a7373fca4df9ca0c0c9c8aa	let it pee outside before you go and sleep. he'll get used to peeing there or tie him next a a training pad. make sure it is extra absorbent or pee will get on your rug. i "study" dogs with my sis so i think i know most of the things about dogs.|`|ad263659c6b533283b529310505b7163aa	buy a pad and put it on the porch (if winter but it in bathroom) and the hardest part say no and yell at it (not to loud) and if he/she does it correctly give he/she a little treat eventually in will grow used to it|`|031da787af729857dce16b072ca23126aa	It's not difficult your basically training yourself.

Try using a specific command like "go outside" or "go potty", something like that to get the point to the puppy. Have patience & good luck!

n7bok7NRaa	While there is a chance your cat might have eaten it, it may be that she's just swatted it somewhere you can't find it.    Since she is so small, if she has eaten it, she may begin to act very strangely right away, breathing heavily, and possibly losing her sense of balance.    Now, the good news is, if you're taking the XR version, you'll have some time to get to a vet and get them to safely remove the pill.    You cannot make a cat vomit on your own, do not try. Take your cat to a vet straight away (especially if anything from the list below begins to apply). The vet will be able to pump the kitty's stomach and hopefully the dose it gets will be minimal.|`|X1gibbXNaa	Its not certain that she will die.  But theres a chance.  I advise going to the vet.

It's not dangerous if you just power some on him in a sink or tub and let get all over him. Then wash the tank with a good disinfectant and let dry completely. I then wipe it down with water again for good measure. Make sure he's drinking water as well. Try giving him bottled water for a bit as there is less chlorine and such in it. Hold off on feeding him for a little bit and see if you notice any improvement. Also try putting meal worms or something similar and see if he'll eat those.      Again, I wish you the best and hope he takes a turn for the better.|`|h4xcrlUuaa	with smething liek this you really should take him to the vet. like no joke. good luck.

You want his propulsion to come from his hind quarters, so gently drive him into a soft mouth to cause a roundness and relaxation from the tip of his tail to the base of his ears.  Well-understood cues are essential so that the horse CAN relax and not tense up wondering what is suppose to happen next.      Being heavy on the forehand causes shoulder-dropping and riding in a poor frame.  When your horse is collected, he will raise his shoulders and step deeper with his hindquarters.  He will not be leaning on the bit, but be on the bit, which is vastly different.      Basically, the collected horse is able to move his shoulders more freely while his weight is shifted to his hind quarters allowing for good balance.  He will be able to move this way at a variety of changes of gaits.|`|AA11164207	do you know if your horse is on the correct lead?especially during gait transitions and using the correct hind leg when launching over the jump?how are his hooves are his shoes correct?|`|bliNBGxeaa	you should build his strength by makin him climb hillls or, if you wanted to spend more time, train him to pull a tire. it may sound weird but it works wonders. a horse will lower his head and put more backend muscle into it|`|TSQxwlbraa	I would use trot polls.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    I have never seen photos of cats up for adoption with green dye on their ears. It could be a problem with the photographs on the websites on which they are posted.   Very often you will also see cats with red eyes, which is caused by a flashbulb.    The only other thing I can think of is that if, in fact, they have dye on their ears, ( and this is a huge guess) is that they mark them for identification, somehow.    Wish you had posted a link to some of these photos, so that we could see exactly what you mean.    Hope this helps,    Troublesniffer  Owned by cats for over 40 years  Freelance writer/blogger for http://www.petside.com/|`|oDVx7nSxaa	If they are in their stainless steel shelter cages, it's a weird thing that happens with a reflection from the flash on the camera.|`|AA10359186	my guess is they were recently tattooed and that is what you see - the smeared ink - it will wash off after a day or two|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	It's a tattoo they get in one ear when they have been desexed.

AA11297919	Well, usually you can only house dwarf hamsters [and some other social animals] if they are related or young enough to make friends. If your hamster isn't a baby anymore it might be best not to house him with a new baby. But I'm not sure. If you do introduce them, make sure it's on neutral ground and somewhere you can seperate them quickly if they don't get on.    Here's a good information source:  http://en.allexperts.com/q/Gerbils-Hamst...    And if they don't get on, don't try to make them get on, seperate them.|`|MNLbVQ2kaa	The last 2 dwarf hamsters I got were too from the same litter. We had them home for about a month then at night we kept hearing this nasty squeaking yelping sound. We saw that they were scrapping pretty bad. It was always the same one starting the fight and winning. He/she used to draw blood, it was horrible and really upsetting to see/hear. We got another cage so that they could live separately and we put one in the new cage.    If they aren't getting along it's best to separate them. At least that way they will live a pain free/fight free life, rather than suffering wounds and maybe death.|`|s2GCKeouaa	I believe hamsters are generally solitary animals, especially dwarf hamsters.  They tend to prefer to be kept alone.  Introducing a new hamster will probably be a bad thing, as they are likely to fight.  Just handle him a lot, make sure he gets plenty of exercise, give him treats, interact with him often.      Rats, on the other hand, are very social, and need to have a companion of the same species.  But, still, introducing a new rat can also lead to fighting/territorial behavior.  Best to get them in pairs at the same time.  Hamsters, however, should always be kept alone.
yU7urgLxaa	The clue is in your question. Border... They need lots of activity. your dog is bored. Border collies need purpose in life. that is why they make good herd dogs. walks won't do it . try taking your dog to the park each day for more activity. Try training to do household chores. Any activity that uses energy will help. You know what a border is nicknamed at field trials. A Jack Russel on steroids. They are great dogs, but need activity.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Two walks a day isn't enough exercise.  Take them to a dog park, let them run for an hour or so on a daily or nearly daily basis.  Romp around the yard with them often.  Tire these dogs out several times a day.    Edit: As for him being off his leash, in the US that's illegal.  Put him back on the leash.     Run these dogs often throughout the day.  Twice a day for a walk isn't enough, on or off leash.|`|3p6wp7DYaa	I think your dog is not having enough work to do. He is a dog that needs to work a real "job" every day. They were bred to work from the crack of dawn 'til dark, running around herding animals. Two walks a day, even if off leash are just not enough. He also needs more mental stimulation in addition to more exercise. You have to teach him to do difficult things so he can exercise his brain too.    With a smart, active dog like that, you'll need to devote a lot of time to finding him things to do. Have you thought about getting him trained to become a therapy dog or passing the Canine Good Citizen program? That should keep him busy and engaged, and you can continue on to agility, obedience, and many other challenges later on.    I would take him to a dog park where he can run free and wrestle with other dogs for at least 1 hour a day. I would also get him really appealing things to chew on. My dog loves Bully Sticks, which are not harmful like the rawhides and more convenient than bones. The bully sticks are pretty gross from my perspective, but they are stinky and chewy enough to get my dog to focus on them for a good hour or so if I let him.    Good luck!|`|qusKbEmBaa	well in this situation where your dog chews everything you should spray some food spray on his bones and his toys, so then he would chew that stuff more often. hope i helped|`|bWl17S3waa	my dog has the same problem but we weened him off of it. we found out that we had given him too many toys and bones that he began to believe everything was his toy. my advice to u would be to slowly take away the number of toys he has so he adjusts to maybe one or two toys he will be so preoccupied with those two toys he wont care bout chewing on anything else. this is what we did with my chihuahua- dachshund mix and it worked|`|4aN8AwmRaa	He chews everthing because he thinks he owns everything.

Making sure that their water bowl is clean is the most important. But if you really want to clean their water, just buy gallons of distilled water. There is nothing in it, which is why it won't boil.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	There is something called Reptisafe that comes in a little blue bottle, you can buy it at most pet stores or online.

4aN8AwmRaa	CRATE (HOUSE) TRAINING        First of all save your sanity and the carpets by not using paper or pads and house train her to go outside. Teaching her to go on paper or a pad is fine only if you keep it that way. Training her to go on paper then outside will only cause you to have to house train her twice.     Next thing you need to do is keep a crate and don't pen her in the kitchen or any other room. Only use the crate when you are unable to watch her but make sure the crate is of the proper size. Crates should just be big enough to allow the dog to stand up, stretch and turn around in. Dogs will not relieve themselves in the area they are sleeping unless they absolutely cannot hold it or the area is to big. Also there should not be anything left in the crate that the puppy can chew such as stuffed animals or blankets.  Food should not be left or fed to in a crate.  If she does happen to have an accident in the crate these will retain moisture and the mess will be harder for you to clean and its also a choking hazard.  Remember that puppies need to go out often as they have little bladder control.    When she is inside and out of the crate you can tether her to you, so that you can watch her closely. This also teaches her to be on a lead and at the same time she can be with you. If you don't want to tether her then when she's not crated you have to watch her like a hawk, not only in case she relieves herself, but for her own safety. She will chew things she shouldn't that can be very dangerous. Many dogs have been electrocuted because of chewing through power cords.    To house train her. Take her outside every 20 minutes by carrying her, she hopefully won't pee on you while in your arms. Tell her "Outside" in an exuberant and happy voice. Take her to where you want her to go, put the lead on her a tell her "Go Pee" watch her and when she goes praise her profusely. Something like " Good Girl, Go Pee" and make sure you pet her at the same time. Take her back inside, into the crate, tethered or just watching her. She will have accidents and (You have to catch her in the act) when she does, show her what she did and say in a stern low voice "No potty". It's not what you are saying that gets her attention it's how you say it. Take her outside as above and say " Go Pee". She likely won't because she just went in the house. Stay outside for a few minutes and bring her back in. If training is consistent it should take no longer than 10-14 days.  Once she has begun to get the idea, you can teach her to get your attention when she wants to go out.  Circling behavior is one indication that she needs to go out.  But you can teach her to rings bells if she wants to go outside.    Remember consistency is key to training and using a calm authoritative voice will get you better results.|`|uqNWj1T6aa	You might have your dog inside a cage, then close your dog inside wherever the time close to her poo poo time, then when your dog successfully poo poo, then you let your dog out of the cage, and give your dog a treat. If your dog didn't follow your rules after out of cage, and your dog is still poo out of the place you don't like, higher your voice and scold her with a rolled newspaper wacked on the floor, they will then know it is not ok to do that, repeat it with wherever you wish your dog wanna poo, for example garage.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Pick it up and take it outside each and every time it needs to go.

tZV7DAcVaa	It's always in your best interest to have a well behaved and trained dog no matter what the breed.  We recently rescued a big Rottweiler/Burmese Mtn dog mix and he is 2.  All of our other dogs are trained in German commands.  He picked up on it right away and now responds to the German commands like he's known them his whole life.  With breeds that are perceived as "dangerous" or "aggressive" it feels better knowing that your dog will listen when told what to do.  It makes you a better dog parent too.  Make sure you find a reputable trainer and one that you are comfortable with.  It is VERY important that you are there too when the dog is being trained.  Any trainer can get a dog to listen to their commands, but it's up to the owner to be self confident to give the commands to their dog and have their dog respond to them.  Good luck!|`|BTCDviR1aa	Not a good idea.  Be thankful she is so good natured.  Trying to teach a dog to be agressive is asking for trouble.|`|uicbw4Eeaa	yes u can train her to pertect ur family but i am not sure how lol because i got a 2 year old pit that does that pertects my family.|`|ZUpE8AtOaa	yes i think it will be ok to train your little cute pit bull|`|M9o5WpOqaa	I don't think you have to 'train' a pit bull to put the fear in people-they automatically come like that.Since they have such a bad reputation,I would try and train her to be more lovable,friendly,sociable and approachable.Prove people wrong.  My best friend in high school had 3 of them,and although I was petrified at first,I soon realized how loving they can be,with loving people.I think these dogs don't get the positive recognition they deserve.I know they can make wonderful companions!
fWf3A3Ioaa	Not as long as it took you to ask this question, that's for sure!    The longest part of "bird sex" is the act of the birds getting into position for copulation to take place!    After in position, a simple rub of cloacas together is usually enough to trigger ejaculation from the male into the female's cloaca.|`|lMSAyTm6aa	That sounds about right. Do they have a nesting box? Nesting box will help trigger the urge to breed. Make sure they have greens in their diet too.   Look at the link below and it has excellent advice of breeding budgies. Good luck!
enC9TvxUaa	-Both sexes will be obsessed with their reflection.  They seem to think it is another bird.|`|PE0oyIWtaa	My cockatiel had these behaviors, so I was sure she was a male until one day when she was about a year old she started laying eggs.  I was very surprised.|`|X3a0exwOaa	I have a female and she is obsessed with her reflection. I think this is just a general parrot behavior. They think they are seeing a friend. My Rosey used to sit in front of my mirror all day and talk to herself.     So not - dont think this is strictly male behavior.
YhH0PNupaa	Yes, you can. One will be dominant and the other two will never get any hen action, unless the dominat's back is turned. But they will do fine. Roosters are not as bad as ppl make them out to be. And I don't know what ppl think are jungle chickens, or whatever that means. There are game chickens, they are what ppl think of as fighting chickens. They are more aggressive. Certain breeds are more aggressive, but most game roosters will even get along if they are raised together. But unless you like roosters, you don't need but one. If you live in a populated area, ppl might complain about the noise of 3 roosters. You only need one rooster per 10 hens to fertilize. I prefer a smaller ratio than that my self, but that's my preference. The hens will also have a pecking order and one will be dominant.|`|4mSZsuukaa	Yes, I have 5 roosters all in one pen w/ 22 hens  all of the roosters get along fine! i was told i had to get rid of some because they would fight non stop i haven't had any of them fight yet!       i used to have  8 roosters but i decided to get rid of three of them...|`|2rXWZkbnaa	The chance of having three happy roosters together with only three hens is very low, basically impossible. One rooster per every three hens, that's how it goes. If you have three hens and three roosters then the roosters will be fighting with each other for one of the hens. Some breeds will kill each other and some wont. If you want best results you should get 9 hens or just 1 rooster.|`|JAH315Tyaa	It depends really on what breed they are.  if they are just your run of the mill chicken then they can live together their whole lives.  Yes they will scrap every now and then but not kill each other.  If they are of a "jungle" breed or fighting rooster breed then when they get older they will kill each other.|`|AA11640918	Mabe, if they are raised from chicks thay should be fine together. But roosters are roosters and will fight for dominance. If you do put them in the same pen then you need to get at least 8 hens with them or they will kill each other or no hens at all.    One rooster will get alot of the hens and the others will and may be killed. So you need to separate them or they will kill each other    I advise you to not to unless you separate them. Or get no hens for them but that can also cause problems too.|`|dd29142df42d00c2832dc987bcd6b003aa	If they have been raised together they most likely will tolerate each other while  they grow up ,near adulthood however the dominance issue is sure to raise it's head ,then you must expect the occasional ' free for all ' minor injuries may result but it is hardly a fight unto death,persistent problems will make it necessary to shift the aggressive rooster to another enclosure .  a single rooster with your three hens would be the safest bet .
TD5DKXT2aa	Hi :)    It sounds like your hamster is gasping for breath. This could be that your hamster is cold or is in a cold room.    My first question would be what bedding are you using? Pine and cedar are toxic to hamsters and can cause respiratory distress. Another possibility is you got the hamster and it was already sick. Sadly, some breeders do not keep healthy environments for their animals or breed their animals too much resulting in unhealthy pups.    Your hamster could have had a respiratory infection. Hamsters can catch colds or even the flu from people. It's possible it was some other kind of infection but to be honest it's difficult to say exactly.One of the things they do before they pass on, at times, is gasp for air. So it is sad to say but your hamster may be dieing :(    If you kept your hamster in a warm room away from drafts I'm sure it was nothing you did wrong as long as you were not using pine or cedar bedding. You should always keep an eye on your hamster that it's fur coat is shiny, it's eyes are bright, and when it's awake during their normal waking hours that it's active. ( those are symptoms of a healthy hamster )    Never get a hamster with a dull coat, dull eyes, appears slow or lethargic during normal active hours, and a hamster with a dirty, soiled bottom.     You don't have to clean the cage every day but it's best to scoop out any urine soaked bedding. Change the cage weekly, wash with antibacterial dish detergent, and rinse well. They should be fed on a daily basis and their water changed every two days.     It's completely possible you did nothing wrong and you just brought home a sick hamster.Also, keep an eye on the cage. Hamsters have a habit of chewing on plastic and if swallowed it can be harmful to them.    Please try and get your hamster to a vet immeditly. And please do not kill him. Take him to the animal shelter and let them put him to sleep for free.

ePkiOzPSaa	The pet stores are generally not a great source of information on any pets, and ESPECIALLY not hermit crabs.  If you are only listening to pet store advice, you probably have a lot to learn, I suggest visiting the crabbage patch faq at http://www.thecrabbagepatch.com/faq.html which will give you a good basis to move forward.    If your crab's shell is breaking off, it is most likely one of two things  1) the shell is extremely brittle, and he needs a new one (unlikely)  2) it is a painted shell, and chips of paint are breaking off.  Do not purchase crabs in painted shells in the future, it is very harmful to them (they will eat paint chips), as is the process by which they are forced into them.    You do need to offer your crab several other choices of similarly-sized shells.  If you do that, he will most likely find another one that he likes better that isn't breaking apart.|`|N04cJNeKaa	buy a new shell i think he needs a bigger one|`|zuYpulgKaa	Their shells are NOT their own.  They have no shell themselves so they will take up residence in discarded shells of other creatures.  As they grow, they will discard the one they are living in and move into another larger one.    It could be that your crab needs a larger house to move into.  Provide several in with him and let him decide if he wants a new "apartment".  The rest work as decoration in his tank.

A cat can be expensive.  What if, when your money is starting to dwindle, you have an opportunity to get a job soon, which looks good, but your pet gets sick, are you going to handle the medical bills and possibly lose your space in your apartment?  Are you going to give up the poor sick cat who may just end up euthanized?      It's not really fair to bring a pet into this situation, knowing that you may or may not be able to support him.  If you have connections, and can be 100% positive that you can get a job in fast food/retail, then I might say yes.  However, even those jobs aren't omnipresent in this economic climate, and if you don't have someone on the inside, you really can't be sure that you'll have a job waiting for you.|`|w4mPekKbaa	Duh... as long as you do not have anyother mouths to feed besides the two of you then go for it.  With your cat vet bills you can find a wellness program at an PetSmart store that cost 20 a month and reduces vet bills drastically.    I had my cat on this program for 3 years and saved a lot of money, but started to waste the 20 dollars besides her annual check up because she never had to go to the vet.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	How about adopting an older cat (over 6 years) from a kill shelter.

You obviously have given a lot of thought to this and have completely worked out a budget/plan.  And it seems like you realize that a "plan" won't always do what its told, and you are prepared for that as well.  I would definitely suggest going to a shelter, however (if you werent already planning to do so) because that will 1) save a kitty and 2) insure that there are no hidden illnesses in the cat that will rack up bills (personal experience).  Shelters take very good care of their animals and if there is something medically wrong, they'll tell you upfront.  I really think you'll do fine.  You dont need a lot of money to own a cat - people who say you have to are crazy.  I am barely managing to keep my head above water each month, but my two cats are well cared for (got them BEFORE the flood) and I won't give them up just because I am a little low on cash now.   :)|`|aa9DD7NQaa	I personally would not get a cat in those conditions because prices of everything is continuously going up. To keep your cat healthy you should feed them a decent food which is not always cheap. Then you have litter costs, toys to keep them occupied so they will not tear your furniture up, and vet bills. You cannot properly figure up an amount for vet bills. All of my cats were strays and one has had a health problem after another and everytime she goes it averages from $100-200. I do not always plan ahead and sometimes it is hard to pay for those bills, but because I love her to death and took on the responsibility of bringing her to my home I will pay to keep her healthy. But it is completely up to you. If you feel confident that you can provide a good home for a cat then more power to you. All I ask is that you adopt from a shelter. PLEASE! :)
DIjL6Tuvaa	Like other people have been saying, it could take quite a while, and might never grow back the same. When I adopted my pet husky, I took her in to get spayed. The vet shaved her stomach for the procedure. I expected this, but I did not realize how long it would take for hair to return. It took months for any significant amount of hair to grow back, and now, a year later, it's still not completely back.|`|gwUMipsUaa	What was the reason?  Are you not brushing the dog enough?

We had a dog that we shaved and its hair never did grow back normally.  It had been long, but never did grow back over about one inch.    Perhaps you should contact your vet and report what they did.  They will also be able to tell you more about the hair on your dog.|`|ad09a262eea23aed99f3309da57c67c5aa	Why was the dog shaved?  Vets aren't in the habit of shaving dogs for no reason.  After 6 months, you shouldn't be able to tell the difference so something else maybe going on like a thyroid issue.  Usually the hair will have grown back sufficiently in 6-8 weeks.  Contact a vet.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Speak to the owner of the vet clinic, and see what happened.  If they were concerned about the health of your dog, they should have consulted you. A skin condition is not a life threatening emergency, and it may be that it was the best remedy to the problem, but it should have been discussed.     A good quality dog food should help with the coat growing back - in the meantime, make sure he is warm enough and not exposed to the cold.  A fish oil/omega 3 supplement will help the resilience of his skin, which may have been part of the problem - the only other dog I know who underwent this sort of incident was covered with open hot spots from swimming everyday, and never drying completely.      Whatever the cause, you need to get this worked out with your vet, and make sure the dog is on a good diet.  If there are underlying skin problems, you should ask for a referral to a veterinary dermatologist for help.  And if the vet will not communicate with you fully, find a vet who will, and follow their advice.  After all, you should be a team.|`|b7a385a1e0de49b6dbf85bbb11d3e42aaa	yes it could take up to one year to grow back, now i could file a report the reason is this could kill the husky shaving your husky is a big NO NO there fur is the only protection they have against a number of health problems,  including heart worms and skin cancer, not all people know huskies i had to go threw 5 vets before i found one that know about huskies, this breed is not like others, so those people that it would be ok it's not so you can flag me i don't care, i know huskies, also i do not know a vet that could not get clippers out of the fur it is not that difficult so something else is wrong so i would check into it

Its genus name, Ophiophagus, literally means "snake-eater", and its diet primarily consists of other snakes, including sizeable pythons and even smaller members of its own species. The venom of the King Cobra is primarily neurotoxic, and the snake is fully capable of killing a human with a single bite.The mortality rate can be as high as 75%.     But the worlds most dangerous venomous snake is actually the inland tiapan !A single bite from the Inland Taipan can contain enough venom to kill as many as 100 human adults or 250,000 mice. The average venom yield of this snake is 44 mg, with a yield of 110 mg being the largest recorded. Its venom is 50 times more toxic than that of most rattlesnakes and at least 200 - 400 times as toxic as a common cobra. The Inland Taipan has an extremely neurotoxic venom that can kill an adult human in as little as 45 minutes. Although highly venomous, it is a relatively timid snake, provided that it is left alone. Even so, if it is suspected that a bite from this snake has occurred, medical attention should be sought immediately. Although known as the most venomous land snake in the world, there have been no documented human fatalities. All known bites have been treated using antivenin.

You also need to get a filter.  If you are keeping goldfish you will need a filter rated for at least 40 gal if tropicals or minnows one rated for 20 gal will be fine.       As far at the gravel I would recommend getting regular aquarium gravel.  You can get enough for a 20 gal tank for under $10.   Beach rock unless speciffically intended for a freshwater tank may leach minerals that affect the pH of the tank.  Also if you collected them yourself and they weren't purchased specifically intended for aquarium use they may have absorbed toxics (especially prevalent near the coast line)  which  can leach into your tank and kill your fish.|`|0OyGno5Eaa	1 fancy goldfish could live in there but they are social so as far as im concerned keeping 1 on its own is unfair and you would need 30 gallons minimum for 2. common single tail goldfish need more room than your tank has even for 1. a school of white cloud mountain minnows would be good for your tank size though.     if you wanted to go tropical, you have the choice of tons of different species, just make sure that they will be ok at their adult size, as they are often sold as babies. research each species on the net for their size and tank requirements and each of the fishes compatibility with other fish you are interested in.    make sure you keep up with the water changes while your tank is cycling, ammonia and nitrites can kill fish, and they will have to show up in your tank before nitrates break them down. research aquarium cycling if you dont know about it already, www.aquariacentral.com is great. if you want a faster cycle, as they usually take around 6-8 weeks, you can try to get hold of some established filter media which will already hold the bacteria you need,reducing your cycle to much less, maybe even a week or so, and place it in your filter to seed your own media and tank. try to get it from a known source though, as from a pet-shop you run the risk of bringing in disease. try ebay, sometimes established filter media is sold on there.|`|wyAtVqbOaa	Go to a shop that sells a large selection of fish and have a look at them then decide what you want.      Most shops sell cold water, marine and salt water in sections so have a look - I have tropical and to be honest, sometimes the colours are bland and I think I would have been better of having cold water fish as their colours are better (I prefer brightly coloured fish to fancy fish).    I would then have a chat with the people in the shop and tell them what you have and what you would like as well as what you are prepared to spend, both in money and time cleaning and dealing with the fish.  It's no good looking at freshwater if you don't want to spend no more than 10.00 on a fish or decorations as they can and are expensive.      Good luck.|`|6KsGSDh5aa	I would stick with a warm, freshwater tank.  Many goldfish reach 6-8" and a 20 gallon is too small for them.

hetZz4c1aa	Cats do this and learn quickly that they will get a reaction from you.  My cats did this for a long time until I changed the feeding time.    My cats always have dry food available and did receive wet food in the am.  I began giving them the wet food a little bit later every day, getting up a 5 am is not my idea of a good day!   Eventually we worked up to mid day and then evening.  Now they have dry food always available and wet food in the evening.    They still like to get my attention in the morning, but not so early now and they are not as persistent.    If your boy has not been neutered, it's time and neutering will help to calm him down.  And, he might need a friend so consider a companion to keep him happy and entertained.  Two cats are almost always better than one!

That will solve the one issue.  If he's not already, have him neutered.  This can sometimes help to relax them some.  Of course, he's still technically a kitten so he may have a few more months of high energy left.      Next it's time to consider his environment and whether or not it's stimulating enough.  He could just be bored.  He should have access to several different scratching surfaces, both horizontal and vertical.  Sprinkle them with catnip to make them more appealing.  Make sure he has plenty of toys in a wide variety.  Keep half of them put away and exchange them with the ones that are out about once a week.  This will help to make sure he always has something "new" to play with and doesn't become bored of his toys.  If you don't have one, add a cat tree.  He'll especially like it if it's in front of a window.  Spend about 30 minutes before bedtime playing with him.  It should be hard core playtime.  Break out the laser light, toys on strings and anything else that gets him wound up.  The goal is to help tire him out.    As for the feeding, try feeding him wet food just before bedtime.  He'll be less likely to get hungry and rowdy with a full belly.  If he's still waking you up, go ahead and feed him early as a proactive measure.  Increase the time every few days by about 15 minutes so it's not super noticeable to him.  By using this gradual process, he'll more readily adapt to a later meal time and will (possibly) eventually stop waking you up for food.  Good luck and hang in there.  It will take time and patience, but he will eventually settle into a routine.|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	All three of our cats did this type of thing...I think it's just a normal cat behavior. Two of them meow non-stop and the other gets on the bed and head butts us until we get up. If we just shut our door to them, those two keep meowing and scratching at the door while the other opens and slams the linen cabinets over and over again.    We tried so many things to get them to stop this, but the only thing that solved our problem was placing a door at the entrance to our stair well and shutting the cats downstairs, while we slept up stairs.     I think you should definitely try the things that the other answerers suggested and see if they work. However, if your cat is any where as stubborn as ours and doesn't get any better, then it might be time for you to confine him to a completely different room during the night...such as the bathroom or utility room.    If you don't have a room far enough from your bedroom to buffer the noise he is going to be making trying to get out of that room, then you can go to a pet store and purchase a good sized pet crate that will fit a litter pan, a cushion and a container of water. Place the crate on the farthest end of your townhouse from your bedroom and then put him in the crate right before you go to bed.    It might seem unkind to confine your cat for the night, but it is much better than the alternatives, such as becoming so sleep deprived that you end up giving away your cat in desperation. We almost got to that point with one of our cats!    The thing is that once the cat gets used to being placed in the crate at night, they will consider it normal and stop making a fuss. I know this, because I worked in a cat shelter, and the first week of a cat being placed in their kennel, many of the cats would scratch at the door and meow constantly. However, after about a week or two, they stop, because cats are smart enough to know when something is not working. They are not known for wasting energy if they know something is a losing cause.    The big thing is to not respond to the fuss he's going to make. If you have made sure to buy the most safe and secure crate possible and placed the crate in a safe, temperature controlled area with all his necessities inside, then he WILL be alright in there for the night (as long as he is an adult and not a kitten). If you constantly leave your room to check on him, he will never stop meowing and fussing about being in the crate which will draw out the stress for him and for you.    If he is still being too loud in the crate for you to sleep, consider buying one of those sleep music CDs and playing it loud enough in your room to drown out the noise, until such a time as he gets used to being crated.|`|IuYekkPVaa	It's in a cat's nature to be most active at dawn and dusk as that's when they would normally be hunting.  Since most of us are away from the home during the day, cats tend to spend most of the daytime sleeping or relaxing, so they're full of energy later on in the evenings.    The best way to break his habit of waking you early, is to completely ignore him.  You'll need nerves of steel and it will take several weeks, but he will eventually realise that this behaviour doesn't have the desired effect any more and he will give up.  Invest in a sleep mask and a set of ear plugs, so that you don't hear him (or you can pretend you don't).  To keep him away from the door, get a sheet of heavy duty PVC (like a carpet runner) and put double-sided sticky tape on it and then place this outside the bedroom door.  No matter how much he tries to get your attention, grit your teeth and ignore him, otherwise you will be rewarding the behaviour.      Hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	Right now I can only think of two major reasons why he is acting that way.    The minor one is that their are birds outside the window.  Birds are very active at dawn and dusk and are flying around and he is going after them.  It's natural.    The major one is that he is used to this way of getting your attention or (forgive me for saying so) spoiled.  Buy yourself a squirt gun (or spray bottle).  When he begins this squirt him.  After a few days he will get the idea that this is not acceptable.  In fact when you pick up the squirt gun in the future he will stop and freeze, look at you to see if you mean business, lower his belly to the floor and slink away.  Have used the squirt water method for many years (since the 1970s) and it has always worked for training.    Hope this helps.
qioH81tiaa	No, because then you would have 2 barking dogs...    1. Exercise the dog properly - this may mean an hour long walk each and every morning before you leave for work.  2.

Getting a second dog could just lead to twice as much barking if you don't figure out why it's happening in the first place.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	No.  Because most likely you'll then have TWO dogs that bark all day while you're gone!  Never ever get a dog "for the dog" to "fix" behavioral problems.  It doesn't work and 90% of the time you end up with two dogs with the same behavioral problem which is then harder to fix because you don't have the time to work with both of them.  You need to train your first dog and eliminate any behaviors that are causing a problem for you before you can even think about getting a second dog.|`|KzXv8ZKEaa	stop being cruel to the animal and get rid of it leaving a dog all day is wrong ,obviously the animal is a fashion statement not a true pet. I had the same problem as your neighbours, some inconsiderate person left their dog all day to bark constantly but a phone call to the council/R S P C A. soon solved the problem.                                                          Get a budgie!|`|RBtAn3b7aa	Well if the neighbors are complaining is he to big to be inside by himself? If he is why don't you get a pet taxi to put him in I know alot of people think thats so cruel but at least he wouldn't being raising cane and that will shut your neighbors up?  and getting a puppy that might give the dog some extra attention.. but I don't know if it would actually solve the issues you know?  good luck|`|zWFJBlJZaa	SEE:    HTTP://DOGSTARDAILY.COM  -- Training Textbook -- Behavior Problems -- Excessive Barking

Not sure!|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Try massaging the area between your eyebrows and down your nose -- FEELS GREAT DOESN'T IT?!?!?!?!?!|`|CLrMpEgTaa	you know they have special points in their body nose head and backbone near to its tail as examples.when you rub those areas they feel good and they love to be treated like that do it everyday it helps you to built up your friendship with your dog it will be more great ful to you.
gM7VuCM4aa	She might have and you just didn't notice. I have some cats that do no "showing" at all. No yowling or rubbing, nothing. Also, in some larger breed cats, such as Maine Coons the first heat may not come until 9-10 months.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	hopefully by 10 months she has been spayed so you don't have  to worry about that.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	cats arent like dogs...they come into heat in the early spring and summer..  if you got your cat at an older age (not raised it from a kitten) theres a chance that she can b already fixed..  if she doesnt come into heat by a year old i would have a vet examine her..if shes a functioning female then go ahead and make an appointment to get her spayed.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	No, some take longer to mature than others.  But, it's great that she hasn't gone into season yet.  This means that her risks for pyometra, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer and mammary cancer haven't been increased yet.  Pyometra is a potentially lethal uterine infection that female cats are at risk for with each heat cycle.  Having her spayed will eliminate this risk, as well as the risk for ovarian and uterine cancer.  Spaying her will also significantly reduce her risk for acquiring mammary cancer... especially since she hasn't had a heat cycle yet.  I recommend making an appointment to go ahead and have her spayed before any of these risks are presented by a heat cycle.  She'll be healthier for it, and you won't have to endure annoying heat cycles.    ETA - @ winday - Yes, cats are induced ovulaters.  You're correct in that.  They do, however, have heat cycles during which they are open to mating.  Without a heat cycle (or "season" to some) they do not breed.  You are very misguided in your understanding of how cats mate/breed.  They don't just breed and get pregnant because a male cat comes along and breeds them.  Their heat cycles are different from dogs in that they don't bleed, the cycles are unpredictable and they are induced ovulaters.  But... they still DO MOST DEFINITELY have "seasons"/heat cycles.  I think you should do a little more research before making bold statements indicating that people don't know what they're talking about.  At least have your facts straight first.  You're wrong here.|`|szRA7piNaa	I can't believe all the people have answered this when they have no idea what they are talking about, Cats don't come into season! They are spontanious ovulaters. A male cat has...not spikes but something similar on his penis, the male cat mates with the female, then when he comes out of her the 'spikes' cause the female pain, this then triggers ovulation. This is why female cats (of any kind eg domestic, lion, tiger, cheetah etc) always try and attack the male after mating, it's not because they didn't want to be mated, it's because of the pain the male caused them. So don't worry, there's nothing wrong with your cat! :) although I would get her spayed unless you want her to have a litter, but be careful, don't let her have too many and don't let her have a litter too young! hope this helps!|`|723qR6p8aa	Hi x    I dont think there will be anything wrong. My cat went into her first season at 6 months old. The vet says it may take up untill 18 months but i dont know if thats true althoug they says that. In my opinion the vets nearby me aren't very good!   Hopefully she will go into season soon. :)  Believe you me though it gets quite very annoying! they stick there rear end in the air and try to **** everything! not only that they cry constantly and they keep going tothe window or door going nuts. We are used to it by now with my cat shes nearly 2 hasn't been spayed yet as we are letting her have 1 litter before getting her spayed. It is still annoying though but still i dont mind.  I dont know about you but that really gets on my nerves! you ask a freaking question and they go GET HER SPAYED. No its your choice your cat so they can shut up you didn't ask them whether to get her spayed or not they should just answer the dam question if the want to! not tell you to get her spayed. LOL.  Hope this helps hunni.  Mwah/.x
xoXkHOVsaa	Could they live together?  Maybe.  Would they be happy? No.    Don't do that to your animals, they will stress each other out and compete for food.  Just get one or keep them separate.|`|ltIuUBXNaa	I would say no, but I can't even find anything on Yahoo about the Golden Agama...are you sure you have the correct species name?|`|NzSA6dmyaa	i would give it a miss beardies can be quite terratorial and might attack the agama.|`|2kp0sijFaa	No.      You shouldn't put ANY two species of reptile together. Sometimes even keeping two bearded dragons is a risk.    Bearded dragons are solitary lizards and really prefer to live alone. Although they enjoy human contact & interaction, they'd rather not have to compete for food, sun bathing spots, etc.    So if you're going to keep two lizards, learn about their habitats, diet, and way of living. I can assure you they're very different from each other.      Best of luck with your beardie ;]
iuwLHT2Taa	You probably moved it in a another cage. When I moved mine, it started going crazy while moving here and there inside the cage. I had it for like 3 months and my neighbour's cat ate it in front of my eyes.I hate my life.......|`|QZBGIOygaa	its called cage syndrome, they get a bit crazy of being locked in he same place, try to buy him more stuff to do or a tunnel cage instead. hope it helps|`|9kTejB0uaa	Cabin crazy?|`|5PatAvshaa	Take it out and let it run around. It's probably going crazy locked up.|`|rZMc7vTXaa	Running in circles either means the hamster has had a stroke or has an ear infection, whichever it is please take her/him to the vet.|`|CvLwS9p5aa	the senses on one side of body might not be working, maybe it bumbed it's head on something - take her to the vet|`|BaNrweQ4aa	it could be just boredom and lack of exercise. get your hamster out more and see if it continues :) something has obviously triggered it. maybe; it's just more energetic and wants to get out more and things. maybe they ate something different?|`|doxZYj0raa	I had a dwarf hamster and it did the same thing.  Found out it had been fighting with the other hamster.  If you have another hamster in the cage, this may be why. It might of got hurt by the other hamster.  Either that or its confused.  Take it to the vets.|`|mAvwcn4uaa	it's just bored...........what else is there to do in a cage?|`|qJOFWT9Oaa	Maybe it thinks he/she is a dog  :P|`|AA10836349	mmm.. maybe it has gone a bit funny in the head... i am not kidding... i got a dog that is very old and she is confused all the time. and old people go bit funny when they are fraul and old. so maybe it is its age.    hope that answered your question.|`|OjUil3fAaa	She could be completely bored and a bit hyperactive, or could have an actual problem, which is likely if you got her at a petstore.  If it continues, try changing the bedding, and if she keeps running around in circles, take her to the vet. Good luck.|`|OhpbLfdraa	no i dont think so maybe its playing but you should take professional advice cause it may have a kind of pain but i think hes just playing because rodents just like to run around
FlZD2OHdaa	Did you just get him pretty recently? Did you change his food? These are 2 big things that can cause that... a sudden change in environment and food can mess up their stomachs. You can also make chicken and rice and use it as 1/2 his food... it helps settle their upset stomachs. You really should see a vet though. This can be a sign of serious illness and puppies can easily get too sick to recover.|`|W0buucLsaa	I'd take him to a vet... this *could* be parvo. If the diarrhea is extremely noxious (i.e. it smells not like normal poop but incredibly foul and almost chemical), take him to the vet N-O-W as this means he almost definitely has parvo. Parvo kills 40% of puppies that get it WITH adequate veterinary treatment, so this could be very serious.     I hope for your sake that it's just regular puppy stomach upset.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	since you said that he will eat anything then maybe he got hold of something harmful...  keep fluids in him and if this continues you may want to get him examined by a vet..  good luck|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Take this puppy to the vet IMMEDIATELY - puppies fade fast, and this one could easily have a very bad infection, despite the vaccines.|`|cu2mJmvZaa	take him to the vet|`|9kTejB0uaa	Puppies can and do pick up bugs, depending on what they get into.  It needn't necessarily be parvo.  However, much as it could be something simple, if he's very young, this sort of thing can lead to dehydration very rapidly.  He does need to see a vet to get something to shut down the 'outflow'.  Have you checked his temperature?    Withhold food until you've seen your vet (today) because his system needs to rest - putting more food in will only cause more diarrhoea.  But make sure he keeps drinking.|`|Fu0Wk7ZYaa	There could be the answer,the puppy may have eaten something that does not agree with his digestive tract,or possibly he may have gotten,in contact with parvo,distemper,or other puppy things that would have come by from no shots,take him to the vet if this contiues.|`|e7e3a4238cb028d1871039a27332b65aaa	Call your vet and ask them what you should do.|`|B6tGaZNNaa	Somes like he ate some turkey. That'll do it.
AA10229248	I have foster several shy and older dogs. Getting into a routine and sticking with it goes a long way. Many of these dogs have had so much uncertainty in their lives that once they get used to a routine they really start to settle in.    If this dog were coming into my house I would start by hand feeding her to get her used to me and learn to trust me. I would also get her on a regular schedule for feeding, walks and potty breaks. Also, try to come home at the same time every day for a few weeks. When I have a new foster I always go home for lunch for at least a week. That way the dog sees that I leave for a few hours but I always come back.     Don't force your attention on her. Let her come to you. Learn her cues and if she seems stressed, leave her be. It often helps if there's already another, established, dog in the house - the new dog will take cues from that dog. "Oh, the other dog is excited when mom comes home and gives me a treat, so I guess I can trust mom." If there isn't another dog in the house, that's fine; it just may take longer for her to come around.    Remember that it will take time. But in the end it should work out.|`|9kTejB0uaa	The thing dogs respond to most is a routine.  She needs to know where her bed is, that her food will arrive regularly, that she will get exercised, and that you will be the one constant in her life.  It will take time.  And it's not going to help if you try to force the situation.  She has to come to terms with her new life at her own pace.  There will probably be 'baggage' that she comes with, but to start with, cut her some slack until you have started to establish a bond with her and you find out what makes her tick.  You might set the ground rules from day one, but go easy if she makes a mistake.  Good luck.|`|1DT7OUuHaa	It may take time but if she let you rub her tummy even after a few minutes and she just met you, that's good news!  People may disagree but a dog's best friend is yummy treats followed by their human companions, lol!  You can bribe her to love you with some tiny pieces of hot dogs or good doggy treats.  Hold them in your hand and let her take them and then give her lots of praise and love.  She'll soon associate you with good food and good tummy rubbing, ear scratching, and so forth.   Have others offer her treats as well.  Just don't give her too many as you want her still to eat nutrious dog food and not get too fat.  Good luck.|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	You want her to associate pleasant things with you.  You should let her get used to you in front of her owner.  Bring her food and water bowls, bed, toys, etc home with you.  That way she will have some of her own stuff in her new place.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Lots of patience.I adopted a peke that was scared to death of us and my other dogs..I just kept her quite and let her do her own thing.If she wanted to come to me I put my hand out so she could sniff it..I talked in a very soft voice to her and offered treats if she did'nt take it from my hand I put it in front of her and backed up..My girl took awhile but she is now a very happy girl and goes to everyone..Just reassure her it's OK as she has been with this other person for 5yrs and does'nt know whats happeneing..Give her tummy rubbings and give her a special bed to sleep in..she'll come around she has to learn to trust you.|`|iRZK0KFbaa	Sit on the floor and ignore her while holding a handful of dry food.    When she approaches you, give her one and casually look at her.    After a minute (if she stays next to you) give her another.    After a few more begin to pet her|`|uicbw4Eeaa	let it come to u and let it get usted to u.|`|thCmn0noaa	She's probably used to a very disturbed world right now where people come and go, if she is in a kennel then it is very loud.  Just make sure that for the first couple of days there aren't any loud startling noises and she has a safe spot she can go to where no one will bother her.  A wire kennel or a nice comfy bed is a good idea where everyone knows that if she is there it means not to touch her, that way she can get away to somewhere safe if she gets nervous.  After a little while she will grow used to you and the surroundings and you can start introducing new experiences to help her be able to cope.  I adopted my JRT when he was about four and it took him a couple of days but then he settled right in.  They may have completely different personalities out of the shelter too.  My dog was very quiet and just laid in the corner, when I got him home and he was comfortable then his real personality started showing.  Just don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen all at once.|`|OxFsslN8aa	I believe dogs are happiest with a strong leader that they can rely on no matter where they live.  If you have rule, boundaries & limitations for her, she will adjust fine.  Give her exercise, food & affection in that order each day & she will be happy.  Many people believe that dogs do not pine for their past owners (whether they loved them or not) so do not sit around wondering if she is happy with you.  If you provide for her basic needs as a dog she will be happy.|`|AA12128656	bring her home, set her up with all the things she needs, and give her some space to adjust.  try to find a toy that she likes, maybe she'll warm up more quickly if she's playing. the key is to not startle her or be all over her. she'll be a little scared coming to the new house.

5TqgI6sPaa	Der Name K?nguru bedeutet in einer Aboriginesprache "Ich verstehe nicht" und soll den Briten auf ihre (natrlich auf Englisch formulierte) Frage "Was ist das fr ein Tier?" geantwortet worden sein.  Die genaue Herkunft des Namens ist aber unklar, m?glicherweise kommt er aus einer Aboriginesprache und bedeutet "mit vier Beinen hpfen".  Der Journalist Tony Horwitz gibt in seinem Buch "Cook - Die Entdeckung eines Entdeckers" ein Gespr?ch wieder, das er mit dem Aborigine Eric Deeral fhrte. In diesem Gespr?ch wird der Name "K?nguru" abgeleitet von dem Wort "gangurru" (bzw. gang-oo-roo), das in Sprache des Aborigines-Stamms der Guugu Yimidhirr als Bezeichnung fr ein graues oder ein schwarzes Riesenk?nguru dient. Weiter wird angefhrt, dass der besagte Stamm mehrere W?rter fr die verschiedenen Arten von K?ngurus hatte. Schon 1898 hat ein Ethnologe auf die Existenz des Wortes gang-oo-roo hingewiesen, jedoch wurde die Vokabel erst 1972 von dem Anthropologen Hohn Haviland "wiederentdeckt" - mittlerweile ist sie jedoch auch im Australien National Dictionary verzeichnet. Die oben erw?hnte Anekdote geht wohl auf Seefahrer nach Cook zurck, die erfahren mussten, dass alle Tiere und selbst ihre Schiffe von dem Stamm der Gwyeagal als "kangaroo" bezeichnet wurden. Dieses Wort war von den Engl?ndern mitgebracht worden - die Cooks Berichte kannten - und von diesem Stamm der Aborigines bernommen worden. Sie bezeichneten damit alle gro?en Tiere.|`|aa7f13a7c957f21e8c19de85d63c5ae9aa	Der King macht auch gern gro?e Sprnge sein Guru hilft ihm dabei.

Tienes que ignorar sus amenazas, no le huyas porque sabr que ha ganado y el que manda es l.  Hazte de un collar de castigo y un bozal.    No s si de plano sera capaz de morderte tu perro (yo puedo asegurar que slo te amenaza, pero sobre los toros no te mordera), pero por si las dudas, ponte unas vendas en brazos y piernas y al momento de ponerte firme y no salir huyendo, si de plano se avienta a atacar pues ponle el brazo vendado, puede que muerda, pero no te alteres, no te va a doler y as mordiendote le pones el collar de castigo y le jalas que eso no se hace y punto, suelta porque suelta.    Empiezalo a entrenar, primero pasealo y cnsalo y ya despus puedes empezar a rectificar necedades, cada que empiece de testarudo un buen jaln de collar mientras le dices no bien firme, unos 5 segundos lo tienes jalado del collar y sueltas, si insiste en su accin indeseable, vuelves a jalar. . .no tengas miedo, no le haces da?o, tu perro no es tonto, aprender pronto qu puede y qu no puede hacer hasta que ya no necesite collar de castigo. Cada que haga una accin buena, premialo con abrazos y caricias en la cabeza (se ponen como idos de orgullosos y apapachados).    El bozal pues es a segn, si es muy necio, antes de iniciar con el entrenamiento primero ponle bozal jugando jugando y listo, los perros se sienten muy vulnerables con el hocico amarrado y obedecen al instante. . .tambin sirve cuando hacen muestra de exceso de poder, lo embozalas y lo dejas solo 5 minutitos, al regreso har lo que le pidas porque mayor humillacin no le puedes hacer.

Por que? porque muchas cosas que para nosotros significan algo, dentro de la comunicacion canina significan otra cosa diferente, a veces hasta opuesta.   Porque los perros son animales sociales con una estructura jerarquica, todos lo son, no importa lo regalon y mimoso, esto es un rasgo de la especie, solo que algunos individuos no hacen caso de la comunicacion paradojal que les planteamos y no quieren pelear la jerarquia, aunque les brindemos todas las prerrogativas que dicen que tienen la obligacion de ordenar el grupo, ellos no quieren y no hay conflictos serios (salvo a veces que no son muy obedientes, no pasa de eso).   Tu perro esta manifestando que recibe de su grupo una comunicacion que dice que el debe regular los contactos fisicos (el los inicia pero no deja que otro lo haga con el, por ejemplo, y el que inicia el contacto esta en condiciones de romperlo. Que tiene pleno dominio del territorio y derecho a acceder a todas partes y dormir donde quiera.  Como se hace para que un perro se perciba dominante? la dominancia no es innata, ni fija, es dinamica y depende de la comunicacion social, depende de cosas como el acceso prioritario a la comida (comida antes que los due?os o peor, a disposicion, convidarle comida mientras comemos y no cuando ya terminamos), el dominante come primero y los otros esperan. Tambien de los contactos fisicos, el contacto por propia iniciativa solo lo tiene el dominante, el puede tomar contacto con todos y no a la inversa. La zona de dormir, el dominante no duerme con los dominados, es por eso que muchos perros no duermen en la cama con sus propietarios, preferiran un sitio de alta jerarquia como un pasillo o mueble, o zona elevada de donde controlen todas las salidas y movimientos de la casa, tambien es la razon por la cual muchas veces no quieren que otro se siente en el sillon donde estan durmiendo o no dejan que subamos a nuestra propia cama.   Toda postura alta o sobre otro es de dominancia, inclusive el "inocente" ritual de comunicacion en el cual los perros ponen su mano sobre nuestra falda o su cabecita con cara de "yo no fui" es una comunicacion de dominante.   Esto no significa que si no hay problemas con nuestro perro debamos cambiar toda nuestra comunicacion, significa que si los hay si debamos hacerlo, no hay que ser dogmaticos con una especie tan plastica que viene soportando dobles mensajes estoicamente en la mayoria de los casos y nuesto manejo intuitivo sin manifestar problemas.   Tenemos muchas cosas dentro de la comunicacion que son similares y un especie que se adapto bastante a nosotros, pero algunos no soportan este manejo intuitivo en el que les otorgamos las prerrogativas de dominante y a la vez las contrariamos (imaginate que solo ya salir de la casa sin el significa contrariar el orden jerarquico, solo el dominante puede abandonar el territorio del grupo solo y jamas un dominado se escaparia solo)  Mucha gente considera que uno se jerarquiza con brutalidad o metodos violentos, sacudones de correa y golpes, nada mas alejado de la realidad, aun cuando el efecto de este comportamiento por parte de nuestra especie en algunos casos de resultado, no deja de ser peligroso y da?ino.  Para jerarquizarte sobre tu perro, deberas quitar las prerrogativas de dominante, darle de comer siempre despues que vos o dos horas antes, dejar el alimento solo 15 minutos y retirarlo si no lo consumio, que los contactos se inicien porque vos lo llamas y no porque el venga a tomar contacto (se lo ignora, hasta podes rechazarlo y unos segundos despues, cuando perdio el interes, lo llamas y podes tomar contacto todo el tiempo que se te de la gana)  Elergirle una zona de dormir y no permitirle que en tu presencia se suba a camas o sillones si no es con invitacion tuya, evitar los rituales de llegada donde te saluda tirandose contra vos, esto en si mismo es un comportamiento desregulado que nosotros reforzamos y que de paso, toma contacto por propia iniciativa.   Espero poder haberte aclarado un poco lo que pasa, cualquier cosa me preguntas.  La comunicacion canina es 100% no verbal, la nuestra un 80%...  Por ultimo, no hay psicologos de perros porque la psicologia como disciplina por definicion es inaplicable con los perros, por eso se llaman etologos o los veterinarios que se especializan en esto son etologos clinicos o zoopsiquiatras.  Un saludo y suerte

Good luck!|`|AA11860101	"Puggles" are just overpriced, overbred mixed breeds who are currently a big "fad" with backyard breeders looking for a quick buck.  They are not nescasarily healthier than purebred pugs. Epilepsy, a disease which has been virtually eliminated in reputable beagle lines, is showing up in a number of "Puggles."     Pug/beagle mixes can be great dogs, but you don't have to go to a backyard breeder for one. If you are looking for a "Puggle", look no further than http://www.petfinder.org or any local shelter or rescue. Many pug mixes also get these mixes in as well, and I have seen several in my local shelter.

Check out the link below for the temperament.|`|hEjMUyhLaa	A puggle (or a beagle/pug mixed breed, as people in the dog profession call them) is a mix of two breeds.  They (and like all designer dogs) do not have a set breed standard b/c the lineage of this "breed" is much too young.  They will have the characteristic of both the beagle and the pug.  There is no way to know how they will act and how they will look.  When talking about mix breeds, it is a genetic lotto.  I work as a professional dog trainer, and one thing I see time and time again, is pet parents that have purchased a designer breed that doesn't live up to the expectations (but of course they still love their dogs!).  i.e.  the labradoodle that sheds like crazy and is still hell on your allergies.    So let's break it down:  A beagle is a scent hunting breed.  They are easily distracted by scents and track.  They are very intellegent but can be hard to train.  They have a strong sense of pack order and tend to be more of a dominant dog.  A pug was a compainon breed from Asia.  They were mostly breed to be a lap dog.  They don't have a strong hunting drive and tend to be very hard to train.  They also have an abreviated nasal system, so it is common for them to have breathing problems.  I have seen many pug puppies pass out while playing due to lack of oxygen.  They are also prone to skin problems.    Now for a puggle....there is know why to know what personality you will get.  But...I personally think it is cruel to purposly cross a dog that smells and tracks (and lives by his nose) with a breed with breathing issues.  I am sure if you go to a local shealter you will find an adorable dog with all the qualities you are looking for.  Right now, Designer dogs are the biggest scam out there.  Trust me....I have seen it a lot.  People are spending a lot of money for a mutt.  To really have a new breed of dog, it takes a lot of time...and it is not a new breed until it has a long linage (not first or second generation crosses), and predictable physical and personality traits.  Don't mean to leacture....just trying to inform.  Here is a really good article explaining what I mean about designer dogs versus mutts.  http://www.grumpybumpers.com/dogs/
Vv3gafaYaa	good for you. older dogs tend to get cranky. you need to be extra careful. if you feel he may do it again make sure there is no way he can be around people. fenced yard and leash at all times. however, if you are afraid of your own dog, you should go ahead and have him put down.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Is this new behaviour for your dog?  Has he always been aggressive towards people or is this behaviour that's just started?  If it's new behaviour and I would think it is or you would have done something about it long before now, then he needs to get to the vet.  Any sudden, unexplained change in behaviour, especially in older dogs, is usually because of a physical problem.  Your dog needs to go the vet for a check-up including a geriatric blood panel to find out if there's something physical wrong with him.  You shouldn't delay, things can change quickly in older dogs and if he has a problem, if you catch it early enough, it's most likely treatable.  Get him some help!|`|c19d40077c79a2eef0b5d524de3b8c26aa	No you are not wrong to take him with you. If you don't get some serious dog training in with him before he bites again you will be being very negligent and irresponsible.    Puppies bite sometimes, it is usually because they are scared and or (as with children) feel superior. He just needs some intervention. Lots of Humane Society organizations have free or very inexpensive training programs available. If you have a few more $$ then you could try a professional trainer that comes to your home and evaluates how you interact with your dog and then helps you take charge of whatever is wrong.    Keep him close until you get that training and give him a little kiss on his puppy forhead.|`|AA10555210	i dont think it was wrong to do this, it is not a good thing your dog did bite it is naver a good thing, but why did it happen, what was involed i had a dog that went after bikes not people just people happen to be on the bike, if you want to save the dog and help to keep it from happening agian you need to take him to see a dog behavest and see whats going on and mabe some training is needed, but the all fact your dog is old and old dogs somtimes trun like this becouse same as many people they slowy forget things and get very unsucre. good luck.|`|be6822961f6228ede6b8d06c61d6456aaa	You weren't wrong. he could have injured you one day, or caused alot of damage to others. He just didn't understand what a danger he was. My advice is to think of something else, or try to, and then in a few years buy another. Try something new, it will take your mind off the dog, sorry.|`|4kVTJnyCaa	well you don't know what that person did to your dog to make ur dog bite in the first place. some dogs are over active and just get to playful. think about how your life would be without him it just like a big chunk of your heart that you can never ever put back in. i think right now your dog is happier than ever that he is with you and being loved by you to.i think you made a good descion not to put him down.|`|M1at6KE9aa	Well, I probably would have done the same thing.  Has your dog had his Rabies shot?  If so, he should have one at once!  Was he out loose when the bite occurred?  In the future, you will need to keep him confined when strangers are around.  Sometimes dogs bite because they sense that their owner is being threatened in some way.  Could he have been trying to protect you?  You did not provide a whole lot of information.  If this is the first time he has ever bitten anyone, I would give him another chance but, as I said before, I would keep him confined when people come over to visit.  The next time things could be much more serious.|`|UK65dwr9aa	That was a very good quick decision not to put him down - I mean he's your best friend and the harmless bite was most probally an act of protection towards yourself. If he's 10 years old it may also be an age factor - dogs get more grumpy and protective the older they get.  Just give him heaps of love and maybe give him some training - don't believe the saying old dogs can't learn new tricks because that's no way true. Training creates a strong bond between human and dog and he will trust and listen to you.  Don't put him down - it's just a one time thing and if it becomes a habit try keep him more secure.  Good Luck|`|be3d2SiIaa	I love dogs over cats but they are a real handful. Dogs need to be house broken which can take a couple months if they are stubborn. A cat will use its litter box after it is shown it a couple times and you put it in it. Puppies will chew on everything they can. Dogs also have accidents in the house when your not there. So if you don't want the hassle i suggest you get a kitten have them fixed and dueclawede.|`|gMEWWI9faa	I don't think he deserved to be put down for that at all.  I hope you didn't go through with it.  DID YOU?  Anyway, just try not to get him to close to people when you talk him outside.  Maybe walk him or talk him out of your yard, when not many people are around like early in the morning or when it starts to get dark.  I don't think he will hurt you either, you had him, it seems like a long time, and he knows you so he shouldn't bite you.  Just keep him away from people like the one he bite.  But don't kill him because he bite.  It's not right.
