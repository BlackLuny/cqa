bZe2bSMdaa	I worked in the food industry for years and still do mine the way they suggest/require. A full sink of hot water to which a bit of bleach has been added, allow them to air dry in a dish drainer. Drying your dishes with a towel defeats having washed them as towels harbor and transfer bacteria.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	I fill the wash side up halfway and wash half the dishes and fill up the other empty sink with clean un-rinsed dishes.  then i rinse those dishes in the wash side so the hot water fills the rest of the sink up and i can wash the rest of the dishes with a renew hot water.  you need to rinse with hot water to be food safe, and they dry faster|`|O0VQqIkDaa	Normally I just rinse each item individually with hot water.|`|Xu4zdMhbaa	To save water if you have tons of them then it would be better to rinse in a sink full of water.  If you have only a couple of plates and such then running water would be better.  But since the dishes are clean when you rinse them it makes no sanitary difference either way.  In food service they have whats called a three compartment sink and it is exactly that, three compartments.  The first is the hot, soapy water, the second is rinse water and the third is sanitizer water.  The rinse water does not need to be any particular temperature to be effective assuming you did an adequate job washing.  The sanitizer water had to be kept around room temp and at a certain pH to be effective, but again is not necessary for home use.  Hope answers your question fully.|`|RTaimrg7aa	I always rinsed them under running water with hot water (the hot water dries quicker)|`|SBZOVEueaa	individually under cold running water - your dishwater is hot, so why rinse in hot as well??? you are only running up your water and elec bill - soap and hot water already sanitizes|`|zfyiON4Qaa	i go back and forth on this.  i have a rinsing tub (i don't like my dishes to touch bare sink, it grosses me out for some reason) and typically i go with that.  but, sometimes i go through phases where rinsing separately feels "cleaner". it's more an issue of wasting water, and if you don't notice anything left on the dishes, i say go with a rinsing tub.     as to the temperature, i just use cold water.      i always air dry though.  i don't know where i heard it, but i've been told it is much better to air dry.      i hope that helped some!|`|nIzmM8K3aa	I think washing it in a sink full of water is better. Doing it both ways it equally clean, but by washing your dishes in a sink full of water is saving water and money. Washing it in hot water is best because that takes the germs off better just like when you're washing your hands. Great question!|`|AA11685844	Letting the water run is a waste of resources and money.

geih5vR8aa	Is it a LOT of water, or just a small puddle?<br>  <br>  This could be multiple reasons. Did she watch it actually overflow (overflow is the correct term... overflew has to do with flying).  If she didn't watch it overflow, then it could be your drain backed up when the water was draining out during the the spin cycle.<br>  <br>  Another thing it could be, is if she actually saw it come over the top of the tub, then the water valve could have gotten stuck open, or held open. The washer has a valve that opens up when you turn the machine on to let the water in, then it is supposed to close when the tub has filled up with enough water. I have seen times where sand, sediment, or a tiny pebble gets caught in between the valve and holds it open, thus, causing the washer to overflow.<br>  <br>  Another thing for water on the floor, is that the pump may be bad. A bad pump can leak water on the ground... again, this might be the case if your mom didn't actually see the water coming out over the top of the machine.<br>  <br>  The last possibility, is that your mom was indeed washing bed covers, which should be done at a laundromat (in the big, heavy duty washers), or dry cleaners. They are too big for a standard washer, and one, will burn out your motor quicker, because it is a heavier load, and two, because they are so absorbent, they will hold more water in them, helping add more weight to the tub, and making the tranny and motor work that much harder.<br>  <br>  If you have too many clothes, or have a full load, then water can be splashed around when the washer is agitating. <br>  <br>  If there is a little bit of water, you can run it again with a full load, but you're going to want to sit there and try and find out where exactly it is leaking from. If it's a TON of water, you can do this too, but you're going to have to clean up another mess... just make sure you turn the machine off before it spills out ALL the water.<br>  <br>  My guess, is that the water valve is either broken, or was held open. If not that, then it was probably the drain getting backed up, in which you will need to snake the pipe out and clean out whatever is causing it to back up.<br>  <br>  If your machine is broken, then fixing it may not be the best option. If it's an old whirlpool or maytag, or off brand, then it's not worth very much money... the cost to repair a washer is around $75 for a housecall from normal repairmen, and parts are costly too... and they usually don't know what they're doing, so they're going to say that it will 2-3 hours to repair it... and by the time you're done, you'll owe them $300 for the repair... which will make more sense to try to find another washer.<br>  <br>  To clean up the water... well, they have those SHAMWOW things that are supposed to be pretty good. Other than that, regular towels, and a heaters are the only way to get the water out of carpet and avoid a mold problem.
VWLtJoX2aa	A mole just digs from the side and is used all the time.  Do you ever see a road crew laying line along the street?  They use a backhoe but then like at an intersection when they are running lines across a paved street they don't want to dig up the asphalt so they use a mole.  It's totally reliable.  There is probably a cost difference but if you don't want your yard dug up then it's probably worth it.|`|UQWusO1waa	moles are a mechanical device to run cable, pipes etc. they work great.<br>  <a href="http://www.portamole.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.portamole.com/index.html</a>|`|0h9aD7Toaa	The 'Mole" your plumber is probably talking about is a bullet shaped of heavy stainless steel with a big air operated slide hammer in it, they are use all over the place all you need is a big compressor and hose and you are set to go, they will pound through a lot..

jcauTPLZaa	No you have 240 volts not 220. You have both 240 volts outside in the main service panel and 240 volts in your sub-panel. Despite whats been said so far 240 volts is not 2 120 volt lines added together. You only get 120 by going to neutral or ground from one 240 volt line. Check your outlet go from both hots you should have 240 if its there its your stove. If you don't have 240 or close to it, go to your breaker. Check at the terminal screws on the breaker. If you have it there, then you have a problem with either your wires, or your outlet. If you don't have 240 at your breaker, change out the breaker. If that doesn't fix it then you have a problem with your buss bar and then its time to call in an electrician to check it out for you.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	Um, yeah that is right, every standard outlet in your house is 120V.<br>  <br>  Your circuit breaker should have a 220V(240V same thing(120V is actually only 110V)) breaker for your electric stove as well as your electric dryer if you have one.  It should take up two spots in your breaker box.  Actually, if it isn't wired correctly, your stove should be constantly flipping the breaker.<br>  <br>  I don't think you are on the right track in diagnosing your stoves problem.|`|01a15b274ab4f4b0508b31a58db88c90aa	240 V. to the house, 240 V. within the house.<br>  <br>  Your range, maybe water heater, air conditioner, hot tub, well pump if you have one, will be 240 V.<br>  <br>  It is possible one leg of the 240 V. breaker is tripped.  It is possible you have an element burned out in the stove.  It is possible the stove is too small for what you are trying to do.<br>  <br>  Check your electrical panel and reset the double-pole breaker that controls the stove and see what happens.<br>  <br>  If nothing changes, get a volt meter and make sure you have 240 V. at the stove outlet.|`|AHZ7fgQHaa	In north america, 240 is just 2 120 volt lines.

Unless a wire has come off your breaker, it's not likely that you would get half power at a 240 outlet.  It's possible, I guess.  Just get a meter and stick the leads directly into the outlet holes.  If it's 240, it's your stove.|`|AA11146515	Ok I have seen this happen be fore try making sure the stove is completely plugged in I had one one time the plug was only half inserted the range top would work but the oven itself would only get warm|`|HI0oQriqaa	your electric stove needs 220 . the three lines coming to your breaker box  are 120 120 and common. most  stoves requires the two 120 lines while the rest of your house needs 120 and common . get an electrician to check your problem . it is dangerous to try and fix electrical problems unless you have training.|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	If the wire that comes out of the bottom of the breaker box outside goes into another breaker box inside, and there's a double breaker on the top of the inside breaker box, then you should have 220 inside the home.   You don't mention whether you've measured this voltage or whether you're just guessing, but it needs to be checked, preferably at the inside box.  If you indeed have 220, then there's other problems with the range.  You also don't mention where the heat problem is on the range, is it the stove top elements, or the oven that's not working properly?  Several of the folks have mentioned  other possible problems  which need to be checked out to diagnose the problem.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Are you talking about a skeleton key in a mortised lock?  If so, it doesn't matter if they can push the key out because the door will still be locked.  And if it was unlocked first, door would be open so that doesn't matter either.    If you're talking about a dual cylinder deadbolt,  it is very difficult, if not impossible to push out the key from the other side.  But the same thing applies;  If it's pushed out, the door would still be locked.    Many areas forbid the installation of these locks in residential buildings due to fire safety.  They are mainly used for commercial applications.    I understand the need for them in residential dwellings;  such as if someone breaks in through a window,  they still wouldn't be able to open the front door to escape with your belongings.  You just have to ask yourself if it's worth the risk.  Especially if you have young children in the house...|`|dXrHoLMCaa	if your deadbolt has a key for INSIDE as well as outside, then the key needs to be readily available for you in an emergency... most folks do what you said, leave it in the lock.....but if there's unknown folks running around, it should be removed.... cuz if it turns up missing, you'll have no idea WHO might have nabbed it......|`|4wIZfiWaaa	When I lived in Germany my apartment had locks like this.

If you leave it in your door someone might just go in and steal your stuff!    So just keep a remembrance that you go the right way    By Lynette *o* :)|`|QLgYufDmaa	Often a dead-bolt that requires a key for both sides is installed because the lock is next to a window.  It is done so a burglar can't easily break the window and unlock the door.  If this is the case with your door, you may consider removing the key when you are home.|`|sCMYwtonaa	You should replace the deadbolt with a new one that has a lever inside to turn the lock. A double keyed deadbolt is very dangerous and is against most residential codes. If there was ever a fire and you or one of your family members wanted to get out they would be stuck without the key. Either leave the key in or get a new lock, for the sake of safety.
8apA3Rffaa	Wire wheel on a grinder or on the drill. Both you ll have to watch your  fingers and go slow. I ve also used a power sander.  I ve had to use my wet saw before.  The 1 st   2  are very dusty and slow but will work. I ve even used a grinding stone on my 4" grinder. Tiles will break if not carefull. On time when I had to do a lot  on a repair, I built a 3 sided jig to hold and set the tiles in, keeping the under side flat to avoid debris under the tile. This is where you can break a tile is on an uneven surface when applying pressure . GL|`|mP0LLMVjaa	You can try soaking them in the sink in some hot water and then scraping it off. If that doesn't work use a drill and a wire brush to knock off as much as possible. I have even used my belt sander.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	In most cases, the tile will break.    For a temporary patch, I clean the tiles as best I can, and use a construction adhesive or polyurethane adhesive to glue them into place.  Wait 24 hours before grouting.    Do not get any adhesive between the tiles.|`|m2jjAKvUaa	You can't get it off. Bring a tile to a local tile store and they'll find a match for it.|`|QI74CxD0aa	Try freezing them to see if that will loosen the adhesive.  Then use a narrow sparkling knife, put it between the layer of cement and the tile, and tap gently.  Be careful so they don't break.|`|w5WkyGkuaa	Try spraying some oven cleaner on the concrete, because it has acid in it which will desolve the concrete.  If there is alot, you may need to grind it off. Try not to get it on the face of the tile as It could  possibly damage the glaze.
459JmuSxaa	I would take the bow off if possible because the color may run. If the bow doesn't come off, wet it a bit then squeeze the water out on a light surface and see if there is any color in the water. That way you can tell if it will run or not. You can hand wash the bear in the bathtub or put it in a pillowcase then on the gentle cycle in your mashing machine. I would hang it to try or use the coolest setting on your dryer. High heat may melt the fur and it will not look fluffy anymore. You can also brush the fur with a comb to fluff it back up again. Hope that helps|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	I myself would take it to the laundry mat and use there tumbler washing machine to clean it.  By sticking in a top loading machine you will risk getting the bear torn.  I would wash in cold water seeing you have the red ribbon on it unless the ribbon does come off.  If the ribbon does come off you can wash it in hot water if you would like.  Then toss the bear in one of there tumbler dryer on low setting as not to melt the fur.  Just make sure he is dry completely on the inside or the bear will have a mold or mildewy smell to it.  You can tell by squeezing the bear with your fingers around the belly section of the bear to tell if it is dry.|`|Ovj7Nf25aa	I used to put my sons stuff toys in laundry mesh bags, the larger ones inside a pillow cover with zipper, and always used the delicate cycle.

gFHTcIc8aa	It depends on the type of weed you're targeting and the type of turfgrass you have.  First, determine the species of weeds you have and your turfgrass.  Most weedkillers require the weed to be actively growing for weedkiller to control weed.  If weeds aren't actively growing, it probably won't work. <br>  <br>  A general rule is most weedkillers take a minimum of 48 hours to fully penetrate target weed and yield visible results (i.e.weed starts to curl or brown).  The label will tell you the exact amount of set time required for control for each specific weedkiller.  <br>   <br>  There's no reason you can't use more than one weedkiller, it's done commonly with compatible weedkillers.  But it's probably not necessary, if you're following directions for use properly.<br>  <br>  Most weedkillers will control nearly every weed that grows in turfgrass. On the label it will list the species of weeds a particular weedkiller will control.  It will also list species of turfgrass (if any) that it will also kill. <br>  <br>  Weedkiller in a sealed container will stay active for several years, though it may clog spray bottle if it sits for a long period of time.<br>  <br>  Note also too much weedkiller sprayed in one local area at one time will kill grass.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	Totally safe.  BUT you have to wait the recommended time between the applications.  If you don't, the lawn will die along with the weeds.  As had been said, all herbicides have different actions. You may not have waited long enough.|`|wKQbNvm9aa	I agree with Grassman, but also be aware that some weed killers take at least a week, sometimes more, to kill the weeds.  Roundup is like that.  So if you wait a bit you may see results.
ZttGhvMTaa	Baking soda *would work* but it will also take ALOT of elbow grease. Soak them in Dawn and water then use steel wool. Dawn works wonders. Not sure how *Natural* dawn is but if the can use it on poor little animals who got stuck in oil spills, it must be pretty gentle. Sometimes it's jsut easier to go to the store and get new grates.

Use some elbow grease = short, fast strokes with the sponge, back & forth + circular :o)    - Every time you go to refresh the sponge with more of the soapy mixture, dab the wet sponge over your baking soda (lay out the baking soda in a sheet of Bounty or something, on the counter-top).    *The baking soda help to perform a scrubbing function and the soapy mixture is for cleaning, killing bacteria, etc.    Work it, my friend.

VWLtJoX2aa	Not to worry, for even though Super Glue is incredibly strong, it has one weakness: acetone. <br>  <br>  Acetone is often found in household nail polish remover, and a small amount on the end of a Q-tip or cotton swab applied directly to the glue should dissolve the bond without damaging the skin. Be very cautious in gently peeling the skin apart as in removing a bandage from the skin; pulling the skin apart may rip the skin! Read the label to make sure that the remover actually contains acetone, as more and more manufacturers are turning away from the chemical because of the growing popularity of acrylic nails (which are loosened by acetone).|`|3AZ63fYxaa	Well i run it under warm water, and use a scrubber to scrub it off, or the water softens it , and it peels off, or scrubs off....Use soap or washing up liquid when you scrub it........Anyway this worked for me....|`|b6tI4gDjaa	dont get it in  your mouth.

JMZkaf1jaa	Buy a cheap shelf unit at one of your local stores.  Attach one cool and one plant gro fluorescent lights to each shelf.  Use margarine tubs, solo cups for pots.  Poke holes in bottom for drainage.  Or get the grow cubes that expand with  water.  Place seeds in per instructions and place on shelves.  Turn  your lights on for about 10 hours a day.  Cheapest way I know.  Walmart carries a cheap fluorescent bulb that can be attached to each shelf.  You will need one cool fluorescent and one plant grow fluorescent per shelf.  I have done this many times and works great.  Relatively cheap.  Your shelf unit can be any size, just depends on how many seeds you are planting.  Be sure to mark your pots so your will know what is tomatoes, peppers, etc.  Also, you will have to drill holes in your shelves to attach the lights.  Hope this helps
jaHkY4Rbaa	DON'T !      Black mould can be deadly.   Have it analyzed by a lab.      Various moulds grow because of moisture problems.  Some variant species will make you very very sick, and some can kill you.       Mould spores will adhere to the insides of your lungs and affect you for the rest of your life.  Research the topic before you attempt cleaning.    There are safety procedures for cleaning mould, and minimum you need a respirator and disposable coveralls, boot covers and gloves.    WHY is your dad's place covered in black mould?  Was it unheated, does it have plants or fish tanks ?      Most black mould stains the surface it grows on.  It can be nearly impossible to clean.

ElBaODCCaa	You have several options.  Use a liquid de glosser or liquid sanding solution to get them ready for paint or new stain.  If you want the wood grain to show through I suggest you use a water based minwax stain and a staining pad. Lots of color to choose from. I have similar cabinets and I used the color Ebony.  Paint the stain on the cabinet and then pull off the excess with the staining pad.  One coat and your natural color will peek through a little   Add more coats of stain for a darker look.  If you want an opaque look you can prime the cabinets then go over with a paint of your choice. Go a step further and add a minwax gel stain to settle in the reveals for a more antiqued look.  I have use the following colors for such many times.  Sherwin Williams Navajo White and Minwax gel stain in Special Walnut|`|0LxgeSJnaa	Stain them    i would sand them then stain them a dark brown    itll look really good.    we did that to our 20 year old cabinets because half of them got burnt down in a stove fire    and it looks really nice.|`|YwVvTHBuaa	you should sand them and stain a darker color to your taste and decor.

VWLtJoX2aa	I'm 99% sure that it is hair clogging your bathtub drain.  Those drain gels don't do much against hair clogs.  Get a snake and run it down there.  If you go to a hardware store and ask for a plumbing snake they will know what you are talking about.  They cost way less than a plumber.|`|JgA6rLdOaa	Another option could be to use the foaming drain cleaner chemical instead of the drain opener chemicals.

Does your drain have a metal grate or grill over it? Can you take it off? If so, you can get something to stick down there, preferably a drain snake... and you can unclog it that way.  <br>  <br>  I would try Liquid Plumber first. Next time you shower, throw some down by the drain, and hope that it eats up whatever is clogging it up.|`|fCF02V87aa	If your tub has one of those lever stoppers--that could be your problem-they screw up a lot.You might want to try pulling the drain plunger assembly out from their and see if it solves your problem. iI it is jammed up its stuck in the half-way position which will cause your drain to slow. You can buy a toe-stopper and blank out the lever.The part is 20bucks in depot and anyone handy can install it in a half hour.If you think its a clog---Depot sells some heavy duty drain opener  -- I don't recall the name but it is a container of liquid in a plastic bag----this is serious stuff it smokes when you put it in. It says it can damage your pipes--but I have used this stuff for years and never destroyed a pipe. If you have to use this --be careful-wear gloves-and don't put your eyes near the drain--in case their is a reaction. It may smell like rotten eggs if it is eating through a hair clog. After its done--flush the drain well with hot water.

You will see tabs that will allow you to apply for 'prep' classes.    Otherwise, horticultural suppliers will offer these classes (i.e. Target Specialty Products).  You can order the study material and then sign up for the exam.    It's been about 14 years since I took the exam so I assume alot has changed as far as study material goes.  Basically, you need to know your ornamental diseases, fungi, and insects.  Scab, Rust, Pythium, Cutworms, aphids, etc.  You also need to understand how to properly read and follow pesticide label instructions (which isn't rocket science).    You will continue to hold the license as long as you maintain the 20 hours of continuing education required through the attendance of various classes (in a 2 year period).      Good Luck.|`|NJULnXiyaa	Study, pay the fee and take the test. Learn how to spell license. Each state does its own licensing.
XzRKYYGsaa	I know exactly what you mean , I am about to clean my stove in a few My hubby's makes a horrid mess .. Well depending on how messy my stove is I use a few different things , I spray it with Lysol 4 in 1 cleaner , it cuts through grease and grime and kills germs , it usually cleans it up good , but I do have to scrub around the inside of the burners with a Brillo pad , and I use the Brillo pads that have Oxy Clean in them . If the Lysol is just not doing the job I make a paste out of baking soda and water and spread it over the more stubborn areas and thats always worked wanders , I was amazed the first time I used it , what you do is mix three parts baking soda and one part water (adjusting for consistency)  You want it to be thick but spreadable . This works on many things such as carpet , tubs , shoes , and even stains on clothes .    I also use Simple Green as well , but the kind that I use has to be concentrated a friend of my dad they are both mechanics use this at the shop , and I got them to give me some , and I concentrated it , and it cleans the stove and I dont even need my brillo pad , but  seeing as I do not have any at them moment I have to do the top two , because my stove is in a mess ... but I hope these have helped you some or that they will help you some , and Good Luck !|`|qPz4Dem3aa	Easy off fume free is great.

First you prime the countertop and then you paint it. If you go to Lowes or Home Depot, they can explain to you what you will need and help you out in finding everything.

In the fireplace efficiency you have listed, you are loosing 30 cents for every dollar used.|`|c8zJDDt7aa	Am no expert.  The way I would look at it is to use the fireplace insert for the gas exhaust system is to vent it up the fireplace already in place ( Most likely you are already losing heat up the fireplace).  Would not have to punch a hole in either wall or ceiling for fume venting.    On the other side , you would have to have copper gas line run to your , most likely , living room /den.   That is my thoughts for what it is worth.  Good luck !

Most wall studs are spaced 16" apart.  If your hole is significantly smaller than 16" then you can use some drywall tape to cover the hole.  Then, apply spackle by forcing through the tapes mesh being careful not to pull the tape off.

A center pole and some plastic sheeting turns the bed into a tent and gains me a month or more on either end of the growing seasons.  It was quite a process to get them filled with soil then to amend that soil to be fertile. Top soil was delivered and I added fertilizer and compost.

Aphids are easily controlled with soap.  If you have a spray bottle, put some dish soap (drop) and fill with water- apply thoroughly over your roses. Mabye a couple of times should do it.  Otherwise, you can pick up some insecticidal soap the next time your at the hardware store.|`|bEoiVqa7aa	What you see are not eggs - they are aphids and the ants are after the aphids.    First thing to do is get a garden hose and dislodge the aphids. Hold a cane of the rosebush with your hand and direct a hard spray of water to it. Repeat until you have them all done.    At this point, most aphids should have disappeared.    Follow with a soap spray (repeat every two weeks until you see no more bugs)    See source for more detailed information on aphids and other pests on roses.

That way, you will buy 8' by 12' feet of carpet plus, since the linear footage of the whole rug will be 52',spend around on average 75 dollars for the binding and a small charge for the seam work.  Doing it this way you can choose any style or color you want.

I trim mine 2 times a year and take bags full to the school to give out to teachers, administrators, and other personnel.  They love it, and often give me recipes.  I always write on the bag that they were grown without pesticides.  Thyme - This one is also very fragrant when crushed or stepped on.  It is often used around stepping stones, because it can take being stepped on.  Parsley is a very pretty plant.   I put it in my flower pots for the foliage effect.  Oregano and Basil are annuals you can plant in the spring and harvest all summer.  I love growing peppers of any kind.  The plant is pretty enough to be in the flower bed.  Chili, bell, and jalepeno are the most useful to grow.  Have fun.  One of my greatest memories was growing watermelons with my 4 year old son.  We started the plants indoors in early Feb in a sunny window.  We covered the seeds trays with plastic to help keep the moisture in and my son sprayed it with a water bottle every day.  We transplanted the seedlings into 4" pots together.  He faithfully sprayed those plants every day for months until we planted them outside.  He checked them every day all summer.  When the first watermelon was ready, he insisted on carrying it to the house.  It seemed huge in his arms, but he was so careful as he proudly showed his Dad and brothers his prize.  That was the sweetest watermelon I ever had.|`|AA11498082	Agree with Char.  When learning about Edible and Medicinal plants, poisons should also be included.

DGsYLEj0aa	Every HVAC company I have ever heard of is able to work on oil furnaces and air handlers.  Maybe the terminology is different where you live, but here air handlers are called air handlers when part of a heat pump system.  I think you need to call a different HVAC company.  The only thing the oil company will be able to do is make sure there is oil going to the unit.  When you call the company, be sure to explain what kind of heating system you have since (at least at my company) we have different levels of technicians and not all are technically able to work on an oil furnace.  Also be sure to discuss rates.  There are a lot of companies around that here use a flat rate pricing system so you know exactly how much you will pay and most do not charge extra for after hours or weekends.|`|dl5Sj0lWaa	Try another HVAC company. Maybe the other company just didn't want to take on the job. But if your getting air, that would indicate that the air handler is working.

v3xEtuLLaa	For a wall, it's width x height.    For a roof, you can measure it, by going up with a tape measure.  Another method, if that's not practical, is to use the Pythagorean Theorem.  To use this, you need to know the size of your house and the pitch of the roof.  For example, if the pitch of your roof is 5/12 (5 feet of rise per 12 feet of run), Use 5^2 + 12^2 = C^2.  This makes C = 13.  So for every foot of run of the roof, there is 13" of actual roof.  If your house is 20' wide, multiply 20 by 13 , which is 260", or 21'-4".  Then you multiply that by the length of the house to get the surface area of the roof.  Hope this helps.|`|x6UJe8jkaa	Multiply the length times the width to get the surface area.|`|9c5de07d75d981b60774ab1e37de89bfaa	L x W    length x width (or height, on a wall)|`|drcqDx4xaa	surface area of a rectangle is the length times the width.

QUHLiqhEaa	If you have trouble making up your mind, get 4 boxes and label them :  Throw away  Give Away  Put Away  Don't know    Pick up everything in your room.  If you don't know where to put it (like in the closet or in a drawer) , choose the best box and drop it in.  Keep moving.  See how much you can get done in 15 minutes.      When you have everything up that you want to pick up, put the boxes in the closet, and set aside 10 minutes or so each day to handle the items.  Put your "don't know" items in a trash bag and put it in the garage.  If you haven't needed anything in 6 months, you can pitch it.  It's trash!    Hope this helps.|`|49rKkUzLaa	If you r really really desperate the quickest way to tidy your room is to  get rid of all the garbage and then throw all of your things in your closet
5C3zkmDOaa	If you have a garage or storage area, build shelves and store items that are not used everyday out of vision.  Likewise, I suggest that you remove closet poles and put shelves in the all closets.  If you do not want to do that, try putting dressers in the closets.  You can also paint the trim a lighter color than the walls.  If you use a very light (white is great) high gloss paint for the trim and a cream or very light beige satin for the walls, you will also make the walls seems bigger and stand out.  Don't use coffee tables.  If you need a table by your couch, try one that is tall and not very deep.  Place that behind the couch and angle the back of the couch so that it faces an open area.  If you need night stands, get ones with drawers in them to utilize the space you have with more storage opportunities.  Placing things on counter tops and table tops will make the room look smaller.  Hidding as much as possible will give the illusion that you have more space to put your stuff.  Therefore, try to illiminate the furniture you do not need will using the extra spaces that your furniture provides.  Plastic storage boxes that stack are great; you can fit lots of things in them and they can even be used as tables.  If you have an older child who needs a desk,  try finding a loft bed that has a desk beneath it.  Older kids seem to love these kinds of beds and they are truly space-saving!  You could also put your own bed on bricks or bed stilts.  A long bed ruffle will cover the storage boxes that fit under your slightly elevated bed.  If you are very short of storage spaces, cut a piece of plyboard a little larger than the lid of a storage box full of things you do not regularly need (like Christmas decorations).  Put the board on top of the box and put a long decorative cloth over the board.  Use two as lamp tables beside your couch.  If you still have extra money to spare after the move, you might invest in a TV that fits on the wall.|`|VOYvkZTkaa	1) Bright white ceilings  2) indirect recessed lighting  3) Very light pastell colour palette for both walls  and floors  4) light coloured furniture augmented with floor and table lamps in key areas|`|qj7cwUmaaa	make sure that your furniture isnt too big so that the rooms dont look even smaller then they are. also, small details like art or decorations can make your home look really nice/modern, or whatever style you like. no matter the size of your house, you can make it look big with the right acccesories|`|A7miTF4taa	i had the same problem. i painted my rooms white and off white, which make a space seems bigger. also, mirrors work wonders making the space seem much larger. you can also use scaled down furniture instead of big pieces.    happy decorating

XpkhUBkGaa	I'm going to suggest that you hold off on buying parts until you check the machine. It sounds like you have your machine in a pretty tight area. It is entirely possible that the vent hose (if it is of the plastic variety) has been crushed by the machine being pushed too far back. A look over the top of the machine before you move it will show you how the vent hose is positioned. To prove that the problem is with the vent and not the machine, run a load or two with the vent hose removed from the machine. If there is a marked improvement then chances are the venting is the culprit.  The heating element is a one piece coil so normally it either works or it doesn't. (It could work if the coil broke and then shorted against the frame giving you 110 volt operation, but that would be really remote). The wiring kit normally comes with the element. The thermal fuse is a typical one use fuse and if it had blown, the machine would be dead. The thermal high limit almost never is a problem unless there has been an issue where it has been forced to cycle off and on continuously. The blower wheel would have to break to be an issue as it is attached directly to the motor shaft. The blower housing is never a problem and the heater box would never be an issue unless there was a hole burnt through the box. If you want to replace parts because of the age, I would repalce the support rollers (3389901) and the idler (691366) as these parts do wear out regularly. You may even want to replace the rear drum seal (4319323).    Hope this helps.....|`|8449a75b059164ff6d7636d90b469f9daa	you really should get a professional. It might even be better to rent one until you can purchase a newer model. Sometimes they have some appliances that they  no longer rent. They will sell it to you for cheap.   You really should not mess with that thing. YOU CAN RECYCLE IT AND GET A FEW BUCKS TO HELP PAY FOR THE NEW ONE TOO.

HDT1tpFBaa	a very good store to buy furniture and stay in style|`|051a951539f4262540d3c7ba8903b5abaa	As an avid Ikea furniture owner, I can wholeheartedly say that at Ikea sells good quality furniture. The only thing you have to remember is the following: You get what you pay for.    For example, if you purchase a Lack coffee table, you're getting compressed cardboard that may only last a year. You spent $20 on that table. Meanwhile, if you drop around $60, you'll get a coffee table that will hold up a bit longer because it is built from better materials.    If you keep this in mind, you'll have a smashing success on what you purchase.

As for your coffee tables...try putting a nice wooden tray on top of it with the drinks/snacks to contain the mess..or leave the food in the kitchen..then guests can get up and stretch their legs and visit in another room with the other guests keeping the mess in there and away from your living room furniture.|`|UQWusO1waa	http://www.strangepersons.com/images/con...    this one is very easy to clean and damage can be repaired. also, your guest wont over stay their welcome   http://www.icehotel-canada.com/
AA10259689	no, not at all. shut off the water supply (if not at the toilet, then shut off the main water) empty  the toilet of water, or at least as much as you can, just take a cup and dump the water into the sink. Disconnect the water supply, unbolt the toilet, and take it out.    Replacing it will take a replacement wax ring, you can buy them at any hardware store, and generally a new set of bolts come with the new toilet. Pull out the old wax ring and replace it with the new one. Make sure to seat the toilet to the new ring correctly (just make sure that they are lined up before you bolt it down). Reconnect the supply line, turn the water back on, and your back in business.    Good luck|`|znFpsUTaaa	This is asked and answered a number of times and should be in the archives of Ask.  However, here goes.  Shut off the water supply between the toilet and the floor.  Flush to drain most of the water.  Use rags and a bucket to get rid of the rest of the water in the tank.  Use rags or small towels (rubber gloves recommended) to get rid of water left at bottom of bowl, make sure you push the rag well into the U at the bottom.  At the bottom of the tank should be a feed tube connection that also goes to your water supply.  Unhook this at either end, but at the tank is better since it leaves the supply valve unmoved.  Then, there are two nuts that hold the tank onto the top of the bowl, located under the tank.  Take those loose.  The tank should then be picked straight up and off the bowl and set someplace where the gasket material won't stain your rug or floor.    Next, the bowl.  There are two nuts on bolts, one of either side of the bottom lip of the bowl where it meets the floor.  Unscrew these and remove them.  Then, the bolts should move with the bowl as you twist the bowl about ten degrees to the right or the left.  The bolts fit into the permanent flange at the top of the drain pipe.  As you get the blow moved, pull straight up on it.  It should release and the wax seal should break which is what you want.  Again, set the bowl on a surface so the wax and accumulated grundge won't stain anything.  Remove the old tank and bowl from the area, then clean the old wax seal from around the flange with a putty knife, dispose of it on paper towels or whatever.  Turn new bowl over so bottom is up.  Make sure there are no ceramic burrs or knobs on the smooth surface of the area that meets the floor.  Get a good wax ring from a hardware store, and if it is chilly, warm it by running hot water over it.  Use its instructions for placement over the bottom of the bowl where the bowl meets the drain pipe flange..  Press it down a bit, but don't totally flatten it.  You should probably use a new bolt and nut set which can be purchased or sometimes come with the toilet.  You will see how the head of the bolts fit into the flange openings.  Some bolt sets come with a small plastic fitting that will hold the bolts upright and in position.  Turn the bowl over, standing directly over the flange, and place it so the bolts come through the toilet floor lips.  Start pressing down and use a slight twisting motion to seat the wax and get a good seal.  Place the nuts on the bolts and start to tighten them down.  You are always warned not to tighten too much or you could break the ceramic.  I work from side to side, placing as much weight as possible on the bowl to get it to seat well and to assure the lip of the bowl fits the floor, tightening the nuts each time, but stil not too tight.  Place tank back over bowl, it should come fitted with a rubber flange to transfer water from tank to bowl and drain.  Align holes and again, hopefully you are using new bolts with new washers that stay inside the bowl.  Tighten nuts from below.  Again, do not overtighten.  By that I mean you can take hand tight to maybe slight pliers tight, but don't crank the heck out of it.    If you bought a prepared toilet, it should have the valve and innards already installed.  If not, I prefer the tubular fill setup to the arm and ball water level setup.  Install per directions.  Reconnect your water supply to the bottom of the tank.  Be careful to assure you get a good thread fit--a good many toilets have plastic and the threads cross if you don't get it right, and you will have leaks.  Recheck to assure all connections are fairly tight, slowly turn on water supply and check for leaks.  If you find them, you did something wrong in the connections.  If you don't find leaks, let the tank fill and adjust level according to instructions.  You don't want the toilet float to allow so much water into it that it overflows and keeps using water, but you also need to assure the float shuts the water off at a good level.  Flush several times to assure you have done a good job.  One thing.  Don't caulk around the bottom lip of the bowl at the floor junction unless you have to, and then only after several days.  If you have not gotten a good seal with the wax at the flange, you will eventually see some water that is escaping and not going down the drain pipe.  If you caulk early, you could trap that and after a while your floor simply erodes and you have a real problem.  Most people familiar with toilets, barring ill fitting floors and flanges and perhaps bad valves and supply tubes, can replace a toilet in about an hour.  Unfamilar with it?  Maybe two hours.  But not terribly complicated.|`|9ZLl7nZcaa	Get the good wax ring with the sleeve or two of the cheap ones . Its very easy u can handle it.New wax ring and bolts and one hour .

The only tool you should need is a crescent wrench (although you could substitute a small monkey wrench, but you have to be careful not to strip the bolts).

jaHkY4Rbaa	I wonder how and why the Inspector showed up ?  That is pretty random !    If he requires a permit, then you have to get one.  ASK the Inspector to give you a copy of the Building Code that says you require a permit to install inserts.  If however you need to damage or alter the water barrier(building paper), you need a permit.  If you are just replacing existing wood framed glass, you shouldn't need a permit.    In our area, windows are frequently replaced with vinyl inserts, no permits required.    Siding can be installed without any permits, but the building paper needs a permit.  Roofing can be installed or replaced without a permit.      In our area, if you let a permit expire, they can 'tag' your house as non-conforming to the building code, which could cause trouble if you want to sell, finance or insure.  Plus, once your property is 'tagged', future permits will be more difficult.      If your property lies within a 'Heritage Zone', you will require a permit for all exterior modifications. (sometimes, even paint color)|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	some of your question i can't answer but i do advise that you get a copy of the codes for where you live.where i live you need permits for major construction for example adding a room or porch and so on.but to do repairs to existing fixtures like replacing windows no permit is needed. so i would really check into this if i were you. you can get this info by going to your township or municipal building

Depending on the weather in your area of course.|`|ToztjpAsaa	The warranty on the roof may only be ten years, but the roof should last for many more years than that.  Apart from tiles being lifted by strong winds, which I guess could be what's happened in your case.  Can't say I like the attitude of your insurance company.  Surely you'd be covered for storm damage?|`|AA10230779	I'm not sure why you called an insurance company for this.    If your roof has asphalt shingles (the common kind that lay flat and usually have a pebbly or sandy  texture and color) then they come with various warrantees ranging from 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 years.    A 15 year roof will usually last about 20 years before the shingles start chipping and curling.    If you have a leak, then check the roof for missing tiles.  Strong winds can lift the tiles and cause them to break and fly off.    Also check for cracked tiles that might let water seep under them.    The shingles generally have a tacky bottom that makes them adhear to the ones underneath.  But in snowy regions, ice might form under the shingles and lift them up and break the adhesive thus allowing water to get under the shingle.|`|UQWusO1waa	a clay tile roof is a life time roof, with maintanence required for broken/ cracked tiles from walking on it/ hail/ etc. but if it is leaking it might be a workmanship problem with may not be covered.

Presumably you mean for 2 single beds!<br>  They sell sating sheets on Bid-up and Price -drop tv on Freeview (channel 23) and they are very inexpensive. The first answerer is right though, if you get in one side of the bed too fast...you find yourself on the floor on the other side, they are so slippery!|`|bwHWizWyaa	I am not allowed to post the forward link here, go to google.<br>  (www.) notesofworship.com home and garden section,<br>  enter satin sheets in the search and then come back and enter satin comforter in.  I think that you will be able to find what you are looking for for under $100.00.  this web site will expire March 22nd. the price are good until then.  there are beautiful colors and great selections here.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	You could try E-Bay, JC Penney or Calibex.  Craiglist may have them also.
1EhbLBkUaa	You might try getting one of those diaper disposal devices that baby products stores offer; those are meant to help seal the stuff away to decrease the smell.|`|zBmno58kaa	This may be a tad more costly, but try using a ziplock baggy to put the poop in, THEN putting the  baggie a plastic baggy or sack..whatever you were using before to hold the poop.  Maybe just doubling up on the way you contain it will help keep the smell from seeping through.|`|d89qNyb6aa	Try Zoflora.It has a really stong but nice flowery smell to it.<br>  <a href="http://www.britishcornershop.co.uk/britishfood.asp?id=SGN0745" rel="nofollow">http://www.britishcornershop.co.uk/briti...</a>|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Dump the trash more regularly.  Or you could try using a Diaper Genie which stays pretty well sealed.<br>  <br>  Kudos to you for actually curbing your dog though!|`|ozWi3TJlaa	I would let the bleach soak in it for a while, mixed with water, of course.  Then, I'd try double-bagging the poo.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, why bring it home?  You're in an apartment, so you must pass a lot of dumpsters on your dogwalks.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I just saw your additional info.  Here, there are plenty of publicly used dumpsters, plus every apartment building has their own.  I didn't know.  Anyway, the double-bagging works for chopped onions, so it may work for other stinky things.  Good luck!|`|6vPiTkiMaa	And why can't you come home and empty the bag in the toilet and flush the poo?  Then wash the bag out with hot soapy water and throw away or hang it to dry and save for the next walk.|`|AA11258464	It sucks that you have to carry it around with you, but is just dropping it off in the dumpster of the complex when you get back from your walks an option?|`|9eR6pNpRaa	Hmm...I was going to say Lysol, I actually just used that this morning.<br>  I honestly don't know of anything that will work. I have poopy diapers that I have to set outside from my daughter and a child that I babysit. You best bet is to either double bag, or put in your apartment dumpster. Do you have one? You should just double bag it.
8apA3Rffaa	You right for the most part they don t sell any thing but Marble threshold s at the big box stores.. Thresholds are a good idea for a couple reasons.. It makes for a good transition between the 2 flooring types.  And another reason that if you should have any kind of water over flow, it gives you a little bit of more time to help stop the water from getting to the carpet. So a threshold is recommended and have it set up just a bit above the tile. This allows also a good way to grout up to the sill. <br>    I know you  want to stay to a local store, but should you still want a slate threshold,you can get them at a stone shop.  Any questions you can e amil me thru my avatar and check my qualifications there  GL|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	You can finish with no exposed metal if you like.<br>  <br>  There are two methods.<br>  <br>  There is a blind metal, AKA  Z bar.<br>  <br>  This fits close to the tile, than tack-strip is nailed across the flat surface to the floor, holding the metal fast.<br>  <br>  Then the carpet is stretched and attached to the strip, flush to the edge of the tile.<br>  The edge of the carpet is folded under a part of the Z bar, finishing the edge with the metal hidden.  Carpet is then seen as flush to the tile.<br>  <br>  This is easier and will suffice.<br>  Sometimes the mechanic does not use a Z bar, and sets the tack strip about 1/4" from the tile and merely tucks the carpet down behind the strip.  The carpet is flush to the tile.<br>  <br>  This is the method used along all the walls.<br>  <br>  Tack strip has nails in the strip and at  45 degrees, facing the back edge.<br>  The nails are slanted and must face the wall or the tile.  This assures that the angle is also to the back edge.  <br>  Lowes can give you detailed instructions on site.|`|cnBZr7NKaa	your slate with dura- rock under it will be about 7/8's thick. You have several options, <br>  #1-shakes under the carpet then tack strip and stretch carpet to tile.<br>  #2-shakes and Z-bar{a hidden carpet bar}<br>  #3-a reducer {pick a color that matches your door jam} backed up to your tile ,this you can shim up to meet your tile height then attach carpet to this.{remember to keep the shim slightly back under reducer to help hide it } your tile also needs to be straight as the wood reducer will not hide any irregularities|`|e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	Don't use a threshold.  My marble bath meets the carpet in my bedroom.  The carpet layers used a straightedge material that folded underneath the carpet, so the carpet simply touches the marble.  They sell such material at Lowe's and Home Depot.<br>  <br>  good luck
Bg3lbGR1aa	Buff Orpingtons are great layers and are extremely hearty even during winter. So are the Araucana's which lay tinted eggs (blue, olive and sometimes pinkish). If you're looking for a meat bird, I'd recommend the Cornish as they are usually ready for eating by 3 months. <br>  <br>  Any breed of chickens will crossbreed, but with any animal... the males (AKA cocks) will most likely pick fights with eachother. I recommend free range if you are interested in getting more than 1 male of each breed. They forage for food, and are healthier, not to mention their meat/eggs will be too.<br>  <br>  If you plan on caging them up, make sure they have ample room because over crowding leads to feather picking. I recommend a 10x10 pen for more than for 15 birds, with a roosting pole/swing and nesting boxes. <br>  <br>  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.Good luck, and have fun!|`|a2ce1097a86fb1054145f9a23192a355aa	Google Murray McMurray and get one of their poultry catalogs.  They sell all varieties and offer great information in the catalog that will help you decide which breed you want.  No matter what breed or breeds you get, they can be housed together.  Sure, they can crossbreed.

PRx6j6YQaa	better than you could have got for the past five years but you stll have to do your homework to get a good deal|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	I know the economy is bad but the contractors still have family to support and bills to pay just like everyone else.  As for a good deal--It is really going to depend as to how hard up the contractor is for money and how bad he needs the work.  General rule is "What ever the cost of material is usually the cost for labor" plus dumpster fee.  Think about this for a moment----Would you want someone to cut your pay due to the economy?"  Be fair with the contractor!!!|`|KDJWKvisaa	You should. Less demand = lower price. However, you do get what you pay for. And don't worry about that poor ol' contractor, he's not worried about charging too much in a booming economy.
RgEtKVaKaa	You shouldn't spray your grates with Pam - you could have a fire.  At the very least, the Pam will cook onto the grates & will have a very difficult time getting them clean.  You can clean your grates by placing them in a plastic garbage bag & either spraying them with oven cleaner or by placing a cup of ammonia in the bag.  Do this outside or in your garage with adequate ventilation.  Leave them over night or all day then rinse by spraying with the hose.  Heat from the sun will speed the process.  The grates are usually cast iron coated with porcelain so painting the grates with a high heat paint probably won't work.    There is a cleaner available for grates but I have not had good results from it & it is costly.  Good luck.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Buy stainless steel pots and pans. a good dishwasher does a descent job on high heat setting. Before you use them you can spay them with pam.
