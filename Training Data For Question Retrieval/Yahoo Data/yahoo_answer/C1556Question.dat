Human Life Must Be Sacred   Washington, DC - "In many ways, this is a Solomon-like decision except that in this case, a scientist has already split the baby in half," said Andrea Lafferty, Executive Director of Traditional Values Coalition.      TVC is responding to President Bush's decision on Thursday to allow federal funding for stem cells that have already been harvested from human embryos. In his speech, the President noted: "Human life is a sacred gift from our Creator. I worry about a culture that devalues life and believe as your president, I have an important obligation to foster and encourage respect for life in America and throughout the world."       "While we respect the President's commitment to protecting the right to life, we are deeply troubled by the implications of this decision for the future," said Lafferty. "We agree with the position taken by Kansas Senator Sam Brownback who has stated 'We simply do not need to do any research which relies on the destruction of human.

Please don't take this as an 'atheist wanting to be god'... it's an honest question.      Look at it this way. You are all alone; so would you rather create a few ants (who, put together, make up the mass of an electron compared to you) to love, who are so unintelligent compared to you that you can't even have a conversation with them... not a conversation as you think of them?      Wouldn't you get bored, even depressed after a few eternities of 'talking to' and 'loving' a few specks of dust, which are infinitely smaller then you are (literally INFINITELY more insignificant...)?      Wouldn't it be smarter to create people who are actually as intelligent as you, whom with you can actually converse normally, and love as you can in your full potential?

20090131090255AAw7DcO	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What do you think of the prom?	What was your experience? Do you plan to go to the prom later in life?   Do you think the prom is a blast of fun or people and society just make it seem that way?   Do you think it is a necessary part of high school? Any reasons for going/not going?      I am in 9th grade now and I don't think i'll be going to the prom in 3 years, which works for me. I don't think I would enjoy myself at all. I went to my 8th grade dinner dance against my own wishes (my friends convinced me to go and I stupidly gave in) and I had the worst night of my life. I just don't fit in at school and spending a night with those people doing things I don't like doing (wearing a dress, makeup, eating disgusting food, dancing) did not appeal to me one bit. I found 3 or 4 people with the exact same problem and we sat together the whole time and it was the worst night of our lives. My mom said that the prom would be like the dinner dance, only more formal, and I don't really want to suffer through another night like that again. Both my parents didn't go when they were in high school, and they said it is really not that big of a thing - the media blows it, along with many other things, out of proportion.      Anyway, I am asking you: What do you think of the prom?

20090131082834AAA73Fi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How about some opinions?	I'm sure you're all aware of Prince Harry's most recent blunder, and if not (just to make you aware), he was captured on video three years ago calling a member of his platoon "our little paki friend" and referred to somebody with a veil over his head as a "rag-head". Anyway, regarding this I'd like to hear your opinion.    My school are doing a debate and I have to argue that Prince Harry should not be kicked out of the army for his recent comments and I would just like to hear what other people have to say about it?    So far for my argument I have the fact that Prince Harry didn't intend to say this in a malicious way, the man in question did not take offence and the army have received no complaints, Inayat Bunglawala (a spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain) has acknowledged Harry's apology and agrees with Pakistan's President, Asif Ali Zardari that the matter should now be closed since he has indeed said sorry.    Does anybody have anything to add to my argument? That's the main objective here but if people wish to argue against my points then that's fine.    Thanks (:    P.S, technically agreeing that Harry should face no further punishment does not make you, nor I, a racist. Let's just keep it fair and deal with this as a normal debate and I think it goes without saying that people should be careful of what they say around such a sensitive topic. So try not to offend anybody please!

I'm British, but i wasn't around for the British Empire, so i was spared the stale feeling you get when something you've known all your life is fading away.      All empires fade though, they reach a pinnacle then go down from there, its a natural cycle empires and nations will follow until the end of time.      People will disagree, undoubtably, but i beleive the US is in decline, soon to be replaced by China, and possibly shoved into third behind Russia.       To those that agree, how do you feel?

Who knows, maybe hundreds of years from now people will find the word "biracial" offensive.

20090131094019AA74CfB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are most catholic priests gay?	The vow of celibacy keeps most heterosexuals from entering the priesthood.  However, gay men are already prohibited by Catholicism from having sex so the vow of celibacy is of no consequence to them.      Additionally, there have been very many sex scandals involving priests with teenage boys and  many catholic priests have observable gay behavioral characteristics.        I think that many of them aren't practicing homosexuals but the anger that they express to gay people is consistent with the behavior of closeted gay men.

She's really nice and sweet and she's fkin hot. Whenever she changes I'm like woooow. She's got beautiful skin, nice boobs, and a cute little but.  Her hair is down to her ribcage and it's nice and flowy. She's really feminine, like the way she talks, dresses, and acts. I'm just so amazed by her. I was never one to classify people into "straight" or "bi" or "gay". I just think people can like whoever they want, without having to fit into a category. Now I think I like her.    The problem is that she is Arab and I know they aren't really homo-friendly. She hasn't been here very long either, just since September, so I don't want to scare her away. I don't even know if I like her, maybe I just think she's hot, because she is HOT.       What should I do? Wait and see or say something to her?

Half of us on this planet are either starving, sick, or suffering from some financial or other reasons. Humans come and go. A fifteen year old, a thirty year old, a fifty year old, a ninety year old. Death doesn't discriminate based on age.       But in the end we all die. One day the planet will die as well. We will all be forgotten, wiped away into eternity of non-existence. It's as if we  never existed to begin with. And even if the human race continues to exist, all those who know me and remember me now will be gone forever as well, and they will be forgotten too by the subsequent generations.       And even if I were to be remembered (if I invented something huge), what different does it make to me? I'm for all eternity non-existent.      Sad, isn't it?

And then I was like well I think he does because he has a differnent skin color. Serisoly everyone in the class was looking at me and laughing. That was the right answer but I still felt terrible...

Like, I know he has freedom of speech and he can do what he wants, but I just thought it was really rude and lame. He gives all atheists a bad name. I just feel like you should just leave then alone, you know? If you dont like Catholicism, thats fine dont follow it, I dont either. But dont do something stupid like that to make people mad, because it just gives us all a bad name.       so, while I dont think they should have removed the videos (free speech) I think this guy seriously needs to grow up.

20090131123741AA96Ctu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for Atheist? try to answer please?	If the meaning of the word "atheist" stands to mean denying the belief of a "god".   And as everyone knows, every religion denies that(i presume because it's called a "religion").      And suppose we can believe what many atheists say about the people born before them, to be correct. That the people who believed in god were superstitious people, who did not understand one thing about science, and evolution, right?      Therefore a few question popped up into my brain, it would help a lot of you were able to explain it in a logical manner.      A) If the people before us were dummies who believed in superstitions, what about all those discoveries made by Jewish,Christian,and Muslim people in science? or was it mere coincidence that allowed them to make such discoveries?      B) If science is true because it follows logic and reasoning, why hasn't science found a cure for AIDS,Cancer, and so on yet?      C) And if atheists believe that all the holy books in the world are all fake, because they were made by people. Who made the rules of society?I mean if we were apes...won't our brains be to small to follow and understand rules?      D) What makes you so sure your not the ones who are being superstitious? what if you guys are the ones who are deluding yourself, into thinking there is no greater being?a creator?      So scientifically shouldn't there be logical answers from you guys for these questions?       I wish there won't be any flaming,"your stupid", comments, but that can't be helped i suppose.

20090131111252AAikZKl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does Islam & Judaism believe Moses...Leviticus 17:11 "An innocent blood sacrifice is needed to forgives sins.?	Please read and simply answer this question....    "The life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it upon the altar to make atonement for your sins/souls."  Moses Leviticus 17:11    I understand Islam is told to reject Mohamad's teaching to study the book.  And further that in this case the Jewish people must have tampered with the bible.  Why would the Jewish people put something into the bible that other than Messianic Jews they dont agree with?  It would be like Moslems changing the Koran to say "Mohamed is wrong." and then claiming the Koran is right.    For My Jewish people while many believe Moses and the Messiah Jesus there are  those that reject Moses and claim "We agree with Moses but we dont need a blood atonement for our sins."    Jewish day of atonement...till the destruction of the temple had a lamb sacrifice to make atonement for all Jewish people.    while there are other offerings for sins, and repentance, the YOM KIPPUR ATONEMENT Was required for all.    How can Islam and Judaism claim opposite of what Moses stated and claim to believe Moses? their claim "It is not the blood that makes atonement for sins."    It is the blood that makes atonement for sins." Moses' command to us.

20090131112931AAdIjPO	Society & Culture;Languages	What do the Japanese think of the English? Answers from Japanese people only please, thank you.?	So here's the situation. I'm thinking of going to live and work there, as I've always been fascinated and enchanted by the country/culture. I was also wanting to learn to speak the language before I go as I believe it is ignorant to go to another country and expect them to speak your language. Although I may not be fluent by the time I arrive I would probably be able to get by with the basics. My only worry is that there might be some resentment towards white English men because of our history with Japan, and our association with America. If you could help answer my question then I'd be very grateful.       Also, I would love to learn more about the Japanese culture and traditions (as I want to try and integrate into Japanese society). So, if you have any tips then feel free to give them.

Fake boobs, fake tan, fake people .that's all people think California is. it irritates me because most of the people that say this haven't even been here or seen everyone in California and just assume that because that's what they see in movies or tv. i asdmitt some people are like that but not all. i was born and raised in southern California and I'm very proud to say my tan is real (I'm Latina) and so are my breast.

20090131112126AAuuTUB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why was John not the 1st successor to Peter (granted that the latter was indeed the 1st Pope)?	The Catholic Encyclopedia lists four popes as succeeding Peter, St. Linus, St. Anacletus I, St. Clement I and St. Evaristus, the last of whom reigned about A.D. 99.       Now the apostle John lived until about A.D. 100 or later. Yet John, in his writings, never once mentioned the name of any of these popes or even the fact that any pope existed. Why the silence on such extremely vital matters?       Stranger yet is the fact that four popes supposedly succeeded Peter during the life span of the apostle John. Yet, if there was to be a successor, John, the beloved disciple of Jesus and apostle of the Lamb and one of the twelve foundation stones, would be the most logical choice.

I have used it on my children, but the other day I witnessed something that was a little weird in my opinion. My niece is eight years old and she stole. As punishment she was given a spanking. Her father took the bible in her room and read passages about stealing and how they were wrong. She read "thou shalt not steal" out of the ten commandments. After that he talked to her about making good decisions and she was given a big time spanking. It was unpleasant to witness. It was not abuse, but she got her bottom spanked big time. Just hearing her cry out, it was so unpleasant. I spank to get my child's attention, and to sting their hiney. I just thought this was a little far fetched. Agree?

My roommate's girlfriend apparently likes to come over to mine and his apartment when hes not there. I was at home one day and she called me nonstop wanting to come in and sit in his bedroom. I refused to answer the phone and she kept knocking on the door and luckily it was locked because she started to walk in. I like being by myself and dont want company while my roommate is gone to work or etc.       I do not regret not letting her in, because its my apartment also and when her boyfriend (my roommate) is not there, she is not entitled to come in. Anyways, after that, she and her boyfriend (my roommate) had a big argument and she complained to him about me not letting her in.       I never liked his girlfriend anyway. I am nice to her when I see her, but I cannot stand her. She acts like a spoiled child and cries when she doesnt get what she wants. She has lied to my roommate behind his back and has actually flirted around with other men. If it were me, I would have dumped her.

This question is not about that)    I'm just really curious how it got there. Who came up with the idea of printing such a thing on money?     Logically it makes no sense: Jesus doesn't strike me as the materialistic guy, if I were a Christian I'd find it kind of insulting if my God was on the money. I'm also quite sure that God wouldn't be so petty to feel honored having his name printed on dollar bills.    But somebody must have thought it was a good idea. So, why is it there? How did that happen?

20090131135406AAITvsp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, can you admit that God might be imaginary?	Look at it this way, There have been many gods before God.   Their followers believed just like you do, if not more.   The ancient Egyptians built some of the most amazing buildings ever constructed, the pyramids, for their gods.   The Greeks and Romans built some of the most well preserved temples, still standing, for their gods.   The Mayans and Aztecs sacrificed thousands of people regularly to appease their gods.      Now we "know" that these practices were in vain and these gods imaginary, but the proof that these people believed their gods just as much as you believe yours is immeasurable.       Their gods had books, just like yours.   Their gods had prophets, just like yours.   Many had stories of men walking the earth who claimed to be the sons of their gods, just like yours.   The only real difference is that their are no more followers of these gods.      Can you admit that it is at least a possibility that it is fake?

20090131143224AAaIQCJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians:Is it wrong to pray to god for a sign of his existence?	So im a atheist now but when i was a christian and starting having doubts i prayed to god and asked for a sign for his existence I was expecting maybe a special dream or something but nothing happened but even though he didn't answer I still didn't give up my faith quite then. A couple of months later when I learned more about christianty and was on the verge of disbelieving that night I prayed to god for a sign of his existence but this time when I asked, I asked with all my heart and I truly wanted a answer but like the last time nothing happened. Now that im a atheist I could care less but im just wondering if it was against the rules to pray for a sign of his existence? Mind i add that god not answering me did not made me a atheist just looking into christiany and thinking logically made me a atheist and god not answering me just added to my belief that god is not real.

20081030222428AAMIzSL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What does your spiritual insight tell you about this ?	The Fishermen always use a net to catch the fish, because the fish can see water through the gap in the net and thinking there is nothing new to its observation gets trapped in the net. Had a covered bag been used to trap fishes, the fishes would never get in the trap as they can perceive it as something alien to what they normally observe. Applying this analogy to Atheists, does not the Satan use a similar net with the atheists fooling them with Rationality because Atheists always insists on proof of Almighty's existence? I used this analogy in this context because Atheists get trapped with the concept that only what can be comprehended or observed with the eyes should be believed and what cannot should be rejected outright. They fail to realise that even LOVE cannot be seen with the Eyes but yet we know that it exists then why not Almighty? Please share your views ?

This is the significance behind the trinity. John saw in the book of Revelation one "like the Son of Man". This is the person that is described in Revelation 12 who after overcoming recieves the new name of Jesus because they are one in spirit as Jesus is one with God. It is a shame that people are waiting for the return of a man named Jesus when it will never happen.

Why is it that whenever an atheist writes a question on here to antagonise religious types it seems to always boil down to a direct dig at Christianity? Even if you address all religions, you still refer to th Bible or biblical scripture or Jesus Christ.      Is it because other religions wouldn't stand for it/ you'd be reported for violating terms and conditions/ your life is so meaningless that you have to put them down to make yourself feel good/ you can't understand it so it certainly must be wrong/ meek n mildness is perfect target for bullies or is it that the truth convicts you?      If you don't believe in Christians beliefs, why must you seek out to ridicule those that do? What angers you so much about these beliefs that you cannot go about your own business and keep your derogatory comments to yourself?        We're all destined to die, but some people will either win or lose. Both a 'religious type' and an atheist has an equally 50/50 chance apparently - as there either is a heaven and hell or there isn't, but if the religion is true, the 'religious types' have gained everything and the atheists have lost everything; if the religion is wrong both the 'religious type' and the atheist have lost nothing. So why are 'religious types' seen as so thick/ deluded/ brainwashed/ inaccurate, etc?? Science/ maths/ logic surely proves the most intelligent is the person with the best odds on their side. So before you go about scoffing at other religions, why don't you reflect on your own wisdom? Where's your safety net?

It was in the morning and I was having a shower, my mum has warned me that there was a tv guy coming to our house to fix the cable. I had completely forgotten so I came out of the shower, put a towel around me and went to get a face mask from my mums room (the room in which the guy was in) I went in, and my dog was there, when i said OH! my dog got scared and ripped off my towel. So i was standing there, infront of the tv guy (who was so hot!) and i quickly put the towel back on, smiled shyly and ran to my room again. When i looked in the mirror i was tomato red!   SO EMBARRASSING.

"Felipe answers her saying that he will always love her, forever. As you can see here, Felipe says that he will love Aura even is she’s old and weak. Aura and Felipe, plan to run away together so he can show her the world so that they can live their own lives together in peace. Love can have many different meanings depending on the person. Love is when you have a strong affection towards someone regardless of their flaws. No matter what country they’re from, age, religion or color of their skin, that person is still unique and special in your eyes. It’s not what you see but what you feel in your heart."

20090131132857AAJHusI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Creationist do you believe in the Theory of Plate tectonics ?	I don't, Because it is just a theory,      According to the plate tectonic theory, the surface of the Earth consists of a series of relatively thin, but rigid, plates which are in constant motion. The surface layer of each plate is composed of oceanic crust, continental crust or a combination of both. These plates float on the semi molten layer of the earth's mantle, the asthenosphere. The plates may be up to 70 km thick if composed of oceanic crust or 150 km incorporating continental crust. Plates move at different velocities, The African plate moves about 25 mm per year, whereas the Australian plate moves about 60 mm per year.   The movement of the plates on the asthenosphere is due to the convective currents produced due to the hot spots and cold spots present within the asthenosphere[molecules/particles tend to move when density differences exist...here density differences are induced because of temperature differences] and that is basically the theory.      Now I personally believe that God does it, not plate tectonics.

Me and my best friend have been inseparable for two years. We're honestly like sisters, and tell each other absolutely everything. We go bra & underwear shopping together and girly stuff like that.   But I'd thought that I'd been bisexual since two years ago, not since I met her because I'm not attracted to her, but in general. I've only admitted to myself to being bisexual since this week.   But the thing is, she has this huge thing against everyone these days being bisexual so I'm really afraid to tell her in case I lose her as a friend, or if she thinks I fancy her or something like that, as immature as it sounds.   So how should I tell her, or should I leave it for a while?   Thanks. xo

No bashing!!!An elderly Muslim lady was well-known for her?	faith and for her confidence in talking about it. She would stand in front of her house and say "Allah be praised" to all those who passed by. Next door to her lived an atheist who would get so angry at her proclamations he would shout, "There ain't no Lord!!"    Hard times came upon the elderly lady, and she prayed for Allah to send her some assistance. She would pray out loud in her night prayer "Oh Allah! I need food!! I am having a hard time, please Lord, PLEASE LORD, SEND ME SOME GROCERIES!!"    One night the atheist happened to hear her as she was praying, and decided to play a prank on her. The next morning the lady went out on her porch and found a large bag of groceries. She raised her hands and shouted, "Allah be praised!."    The neighbor jumped from behind a bush and said, "Aha! I told you there was no Lord. I bought those groceries, God didn't."    The old lady laughed and clapped her hands and said,"Not only did Allah send me groceries, but he made the devil pay for them!"

20090131103102AAwel2g	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ok, here are my beliefs what do you think?	I was born of my own free will, by an infinite number of possibilites the chaotic order of the universe gave life to this body, but then what was I born here for? I believe we all must stay true to who we are as it benefits us in the long run. Problems with dependancy: If you are independent and can live off your own land, you never have to fear for being hungry. If you get food from others, that is not always going to work out for you, what if those people want something in return? And because you planted no crops for yourself, what can you do but starve or beg? And if you beg, they may ask you to, for example, clean their house, then the next day to wash their feet, clean their house and feed their cattle, until eventually when you come around, they may say to themselves, "gee, I could get whatever I want from this person", and next thing you know, they take advantage of your vulnerability and perhaps would use you for sexual purposes, or for slavery. But what would you ever have to fear if you gre your own crops, even if someone came around and destroyed them, you could be determined to stay independent, so that you are never living your lif to please another. What if you could relate this spiritually? I mean, if you give your trust completely over to another and render yourself incapable of looking after yourself, would you give your power away? And when your power is in the hands of another, is that always a good thing?

I believe the holy coconut-milk enters the fetus at conception, so I call for all abortions to be illegal.

I also believe abstinence only-sex ed should be enforced in schools, since a man's holy nuts are sacred and must not be used until marriage.
20090131093726AA9pVDt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians/Muslims/Judaism-You Views on Birth Control if Married?	Hello,    Do you think birth control between "MARRIED" couples is a sin. I am talking about things like Condoms that prevent conception 100%. Also, I am not talking about people who aren't married. I am specifically talking about married couples. I am also talking about birth control that doesn't allow any sperg/egg interaction.    (I say that because I know the pill can cause "accidental abortions/miscarriages").    So do you think married couples using a form of birth control such as condoms is perfectly fine? Or do you think it is a sin? Why or why not?    Thanks so much, and have a great day!

20090131082535AAQnjB8	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	Is this an appropriate Valentine's Day gift idea?	My boyfriend and I have been together since June.  For Christmas I gave him these ceramic bowls that I threw myself.  He said he wanted to put some kind of plants that live in water in them since there's no holes in them for drainage.  I thought that was such a cool idea, I didn't even think of that.  Him and I are super duper into plants.  So I was thinking to myself, what if I sent him some rocks and lucky bamboo so him so he can put it in the bowls for Valentines Day? I found some really inexpensive ones that come without a bowl online. But I don't know if he's put any plants in the bowls yet.  I don't really know how to ask him because I want this to be a surprise. I'm not going to be able to see him on Valentines Day because I'm far away for school right now, and he's not really into Holidays. Do you think this is a good gift idea?

So I am walking two dogs at night, a pit bull (baby sitting) and my cockapoo. I get to a church a big church and notice that unlike the rest of the street the sidewalk it littered with trash. There are two big empty trash cans within twenty feet of each other. I look at the trash noticing the ridiculous amount when I hear God tell me to pick it up (all of it). So of course I start to pick it all up using empty dogie poop bags to protect my hands. When I am nearly finished picking up trash that spanned the entire length of the church and sidewalk I hear God speak again. He says "You can't see the church for the trash".  I know this has infinite meanings and it is really personal to me because I am resigned that the evilest of people congregate in the churches. So then what do I do? What would you do? How do I rise to this challenge to become better. What prayer or scripture can help me un blind my eyes because of the trash.

In the bible it says that Satan will start several false/fake churches to fool followers of Jesus.  It also says that he will be a counterfeit of Christ. It also says there is only "one" true church. So from this we know that all of Satan's churches will be christian (obviously Hindu does not attempt to counterfeit Christ) So if most Christian churches are the false ones of Satan. What is the "one" true one?  Is this why so many Christians are so immoral?  High divorce, high crime, believe in murder for oil in Iraq etc?

I know there are good arguments that we don't have freewill, but one thing is always left out of those argument: spontaneity.       People argue with have no freewill because off a bunch of different reasons, including that we can't be any different than our environment and genes made us. In a certain situation, we will always be more likely to do a certain thing.       That's where spontaneity come in. What if you just feel like trying something new? What if the weather makes you want something hot to drink, but you go into Starbucks, and a song playing inspires a random thought in your head which reminds you of a time that you got a frappacino. So you get a frappacino. So many things could affect your choice. You could happen to overhear someone talking about one drink, and another person talking about another while you look at the menu and think of the song thats on- there are so many factors it doesn't really seem there could be order.       How could your choice be completely determined?

I don't want an abortion but EVERYONE else is telling me to get one. Their reasons behind it are that the baby's father isn't going to be in his life at all and that I just started college and wouldn't be ready for a baby. Not only that but the baby's father is black and I'm white and they don't think I'll have a very good chance of getting a nice, classy guy somewhere down the road. I am just really against abortion. I would like it if someone from the outside would give me their perspective of the situation. Maybe even possibly give me some rather uncommon statistics of abortion so that I can use them to make my case.

If you’re a professional astronomer working with a large installed telescope, you probably already have plenty of equipment to let you know when it’s the ideal conditions to stargaze. But for hobbyists who have to drag their telescopes into the backyard in order to peep the heavens, this watch should provide all the data they need.      The LCD display on the watchface features 96 separate sections arranged in a ray pattern. Each slice represents 15 minutes of time, which adds up to a full 24 hour day. Once you choose your specific location from a list of 583 pre-programmed cities, the sections are selectively shaded to depict the hours of sunlight and darkness throughout the day. A second circular LCD display around the edge shows the times of moonrise and moonset. There’s a single 24 hour hand that moves around a 12-hour bezel for telling the time, but the watch also features a standard digital time display on the top half.      You can find it at Hammacher Schlemmer for $495.95.

20071013114616AAhUQzy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is Chrisitan enough?	I just recently started dating a guy and I'm 99% positive he believes in God. The problem is my mother. She doesn't want me to end up with a non-christian christian. She herself married a man who was questionable and says that she regrets it but they have been married over 20 years. I know this relationship is still new and fresh, but I am already getting pressure to find out where he stands. My problem is that I am not sure where I stand. So how can I dump him for not being christian "enough". I don't want to. He is a sweet guy, caring, and says that he won't pressure me to do anything I don't want. That is fantastic, because even though I am unsure of where I stand with god right now, I still have morals. I won't cheat, steal, lie, and I plan on waiting for sex until marriage. How do I accept, or at the least understand where my family is coming from and let myself explore the possibilities in this relationship? Can I? Does anyone have experience with this? All help is appreciated.

We dont mean to harm anybody about our personal beliefs. its not right just to critisize someones religion, just because you dont believe in it. Why make a big deal out of it if you dont halfway believe it yourself. I think most ppl have the feeling of belief, but theyre just to afraid to admit it, and thats why it turns into hate. But im not trying to change your mind its your opnion of the world and we have ours. so will you please just stop.

I honestly think I shouldn't even leave my house when i pms it's dangerous for me lol like just a couple of hours ago i got into an argument with my mom and went off and said everything i could to make her go away. Do you think if someone has this problem (dunno if I'm bipolar or just got anger problems) that God will forgive them??

Now I'm not saying all are like that because I know people on here who are very religious but still nice people.      It does seem to me though that it makes some bombastic in personality, although it could be they're like that anyway and use religion as a shield.       It seems on the whole the deeper they get involved in religion and church - the less likely they are to be a friendly and sincere person though.

Chapter 4   This chapter is really pointless and I don't want to write too much like I did for al the other chapters. Basically, Marc-Andre believes the ppl dressed in black suits tried to take his parents was b/c they were using them like guinea pigs for experiments. After him talking for a long time Luce starts to talk with Marc-Andre and she starts getting really suspicious about Marc-Andre's parents because she noticed that they're shrinking in age and size. She thinks they're "biological errors" and kick them out of the caravan. Then they're trying to get tickets to go to Perce but when they tried to use credit cards, the person behind the counter refused to accept credit cards from kids (Hugo and Sophie). Luckily, Hugo fakes a story and the person behind the story believes it (about how they're poor and their parents are sick in the hospital healing, blah, blah, blah) and sell them the tickets to Perce.
