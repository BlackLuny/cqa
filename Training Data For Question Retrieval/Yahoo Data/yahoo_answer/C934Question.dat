I owe my fiance $50 for a membership to a site that we both hoped would help, but thus far hasn't.  I have a very part time transcription thing going, but I'm a newbie and no other company will accept me till I've got at least 2 years under my belt.  I've signed with no less than 20 survey and e-mail companies, but the payout is high, and the commission is low.  Not trying to sound totally negative here, mind you, just very frustrated.  I KNOW there's something out there, and I know a couple things that I can do that have a refundable deposit and are listed with the BBB, but I don't have the deposit money (probably should've tried that before this other site, huh?).  So anyone who has any LEGIT, and FREE or LOW-COST suggestions, please help!  Please post anything you think will help.

I applied for an "internal transfer" in my apartment complex and the manager didn't approve it saying my kitchen and bathroom were not properly maintained. I don't think it's entirely true but at any rate, my question is that she can't force to stay in my current apartment, ya? I'll pay whatever she charges me for the bathroom and kitchen. If it's not reasonable, I'll go to a small claims court or something but that's for later for me to decide.

Currently, I'm an LTE and I've had the position for about 9 months, working almost full time in the education field. (My time as an LTE will expire in 3 months, but the job is only during the school year.) My employer is interested in making my position a full time position, however, once this happens, I will no longer be eligible for my own job. The full time position will require a master's degree. Currently, I am the only one who does this job and the full time position has not yet been created. My employer's budget has a bad deficit, and hiring a full time employee (with a master's no less) would be very expensive. The job position, however, is necessary.      What are the chances of my employer giving up on the full time idea and re-instating me as an LTE in this same position in the fall?

20090226114128AAZ0lDM	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Administrative and Office Support	Why give the sack for stating an obvious.?	A young lady called Kimberley states on Facebook she is bored with her job, so having such a wonderful boss she is fired. No mention of the company, but just to be a little Hitler she is given the sack. Perhaps it should be him who is shown the door. The sensible answer would have been to take her aside and find the reason, and in this way   assist with generating more enthusiasm for her position. The majority of people are fed-up and bored with their job at sometime or other, but this manager does not appear to be approachable. Here's hoping she finds a better job quickly, with a more understanding boss.   What do others think?

20090226112910AAs3Uwb	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Unfair Employment Practices - Who do I notify?!?	An employer I worked with for 3 months is still using my name on their website, stating that I am employed & in a position I was fired from 3 months ago. Since I am NO  LONGER their employee, shouldn't they remove me from their webpage, and, since they have not, is there some privacy/common law right I have for them using my name without permission?      I was also fired for illness (that I accrued from the workplace - daycare center with a million and one snot nosed kids spreading their disease everywhere - resulted in me obtaining mono, since I was never able to have the ability to heal, since I couldn't take the time off from work for all the viruses, bugs, etc.) Is it legal to fire someone for being sick? Especially when the employer demanded I see a doctor and couldn't return to work until I had a note, and then, upon seeing the doctor & returning to the employer with a note & doctors advice that I should not return to work for a week, what are my rights? The employer kept the note, but handed (yes that's right, handed) me a letter of termination. This by the way is an independently run business.      On top of all that, the employer WITHELD breaks from the staff. No one there is receiving a lunch break (or at least a 30 minute break when working 8 hours), and no 15 minute breaks either (although I understand those are privilidges not rights). Our paychecks reflected a LOSS of half an hours time, BUT, the employees do NOT receive that 30 minutes of pay.      This employer has obviously burned me good, and I want to know what I can do to stand up for my rights. If there is no course of legal action I can follow, what other options do I have?      I am in New York State.

20090226113439AAw4Kxt	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Legal Advice: Apartment/Tenant/Squatting?	I live with a roommate on the first floor apartment of a 3 apartment complex. The landlord/owner of the building had to foreclose/bankrupt/fled the country.       We dont' pay rent as there's no one to pay rent to, the bank hasn't said anything or made any request. The attorney handling the case says it's legal we are here and when the place is purchased we'll be able to negotiate the rent and stay or be evicted.      So a scam artist came around trying to collect rent when he saw the building for sale and most of the tenants paniced and left. The guys on the nicer 3rd floor apartment left when the scam artist came asking for his rent/back pay. They gave me the keys to the apartment when they left.      I was going to move into the 3rd floor apartment from the 1st by myself. I still won't pay rent (until it's legally and legitamately purchased), but I will however put the utilities in my name and continue paying them as I have been.      I'm sure i'm not "suppose" to do this, but are there any type of major rammifications? Also, the original landlord kept NO paperwork so it'll be hard to prove anything one way or another. Including how long I've lived in the 1st floor or anything.      I fully intend to pay rent or be evicted when a legitamate owner presents himself, but until then I figured mine as well live in a nice bigger better apartment?

I just got word a couple weeks ago that my department will possibly be closing in May 2009. I called my bank and talked to them about this to let them know that I was going to put an extra 500.00 on my auto loan tomorrow so I could hurry and get it paid off. I still plan on making my regular payments of 230.00 (really my payments are less than 230.00 but I always pay more). I broke all of the numbers down and figured that I could get a nice chunk paid down before May and decided that just to eliminate my loan payments sooner, I would be able to apply some of my income tax towards the loan once I get it back.       What I need to know is I paid 230.00 today already and plan on paying 500.00 tomorrow. When I apply the 500.00 towards my auto loan, is it beneficial for me to apply it to principal or just apply it as a regular payment?       I do not know what the difference is and that is the part I'm curently struggling with.      Thank you for all of your help

20090225111059AAFDyx9	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is something fishy with this appraisal?	We're buying a 4 bedroom, 1700 square foot brick house with an attached 2 car garage.  It's structurally sound, but I admit needs cosmetic work.  It was built in the 70s, sits on 3 1/2 acres of mostly wooded land and also has a barn and tool shed.   It appraised for only $75,000.  I know market value has plummeted but the house was listed for $120,000 by the former owner last year and again in foreclosure for $89,000 in september.  Just in your opinion does this sound strange?  Should we get another appraisal?  We didn't hire the company (lender did) but we're having to pay for it.

We owe about $30,000 more on our home than it has recently been appraised for.  We are wanting to get into a fixed rate mortgage, but our lender is telling us that we "make too much money"  We are not currently behind on our payments, but because our payments continue to go up every month, the day is going to come when we wont be able to make the payments.      We were also told by some guy that if we fell behind on our payments for a couple of months, we'd be more likely to get some help. We are NOT willing to intentionally destroy our credit and think it's ridiculous for someone to even say that to us.      What are our options, and why are we unable to get a fixed rate when we have good credit, are in good standing with our lender and considered to be responsible homeowners?   I just don't get it!

20090226122412AA2eA01	Business & Finance;Credit	Over 30k in credit card debt.....HELP!!!!!?	I have just discovered that my spouse is over 30k in credit card debt.       The worst thing is that my spouse is retired, my spouse does get a pension which is about  $1,800.00 after taxes. Our home is paid for so we don't have to worry about that, but we do have other bills.       I do work and have since taken over some of the bills that my spouse once paid,because all of my spouses money goes to pay on the three credit cards that my spouse  has.       The economy being what it is my spouse  has not been able to find a part or full time job.      I am also worried that if something happens to my spouse that I will be responsible to pay them      I can truly say that these cards were not used for me. And don't feel that I should have to bear the burden of my spouses immature behavior.         My question is, is there any way we can negotiate with the credit to lower the amount we have to pay, and also lower the interest rate, and still pay month to month.      Or what do you guys think we should do?

20090225110914AArZlSv	Business & Finance;Credit	What does it mean to attach a bank account?	I owe approx 25k on an unsecured loan. I am unable to pay the minimum payment. I have offered the company a smaller minimum payment but the company states that's unacceptable. Due to a financial hardship/emergency (loss of a job due to job closing), my husband and I can't pay the amount that they want.      Now, we're unable to pay the minimum. We know with this amount of debt, they will send us to court eventually. In our state, there is no wage garnishment. However, we're concerned about them attaching a bank account and what the entails.       If we were to go to court, could we negotiate a payment? Right now, they will not negotiate. They offered a settlement payment, but they wanted like 4 installments of 1000+ dollars. We can't pay the minimum so of course we can't pay that.  We're current on all of our other bills.       So...my questions:   *What does it mean to "Attach a bank account"?   *Can a negotiation be made eventually/settlement for lesser payment amount and/or debt amount?   *Is there any hope?

20090226123447AAXy8rH	Business & Finance;Taxes;United Kingdom	Job Seekers Allowance.?	I recently lost my job and it has been around a month now since I worked. I’m now 23 and I have always worked full time even during the time I was at college and university. I did have savings and unfortunately I have almost got through them now and after thinking long and hard I have decided that I should claim job seekers allowance.           After phoning them they told me that I need to attend an interview which I attended on Monday. I can honestly say that I have never been so embarrassed in my life. I can say I didn’t enjoy the experience of sitting next to people that constantly swear and cruse. I hate to say but people which have gone far past the stage of being a CHAV.       I was absolutely surprised when I was told that I only had to do three things every 2 weeks to find a job. These three things could be just to send an email or make a Telephone call. How ridiculously inadequate as that to find a job?       I think the whole the system is an absolute mess and hate to be part of it’s system. In any case I should be working Monday hopefully.       The question I have got is: How long does it take to get any money out of these people? I am in dire need of it as I need new trousers and shoes (for work) and a little bit of petrol money to get me to my a new job. Not just I have always worked in a corporate environment and If I don’t have these things I will be out of work again quicker than anything.

20090225111609AAcJHuf	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Anyone else have their direct deposits repeatedly canceled?	This may sound a bit whiny...forgive me...I'm frustrated!  Original DD date was Jan 30. It never showed and I finally called when the WMR changed to "WAS deposited, call to initiate trace if not received."  Called - it was canceled and pulled for review at the last minute.  Given code 1121.  Waited, got CP-05 letter (which said my refund was delayed and under review but not to send anything yet). Code changed to 1201 last week - called and told review was over, refund to be released and deposited on Feb 20.  Didn't show so I called again on Monday - all she could say was that it never went out but she couldn't figure out why. Figured I'd wait to see if a new date was issued today or tomorrow when they updated WMR and this morning I was back at code 1121.  Called again - the woman was super sweet and called several different departments trying to straighten it out. She said my refund was, in fact, re-issued last week, but for some reason (which could not be determined) it keeps getting canceled and sent back to review before it goes to my bank and her only advice was to wait and see if it shows up in the next couple of weeks, then call back. Is this normal???  I've NEVER had an IRS problem before.  I had a very simple return - I've never owed any back taxes or had any weird sort of financial things going on.  I'm single and I do have a daughter I claimed for EIC, but I've been claiming her for 9 years, nothing new.  Is it best to just wait??

Hello       I was wondering if anyone can provide me with any good information on locations (state, city) where I can buy a house for extremely cheap (say under 50,000 dollars), very close to the woods, in a small town, and close enough where any jobs are available.       I've lived in big cities around California all my life, witnessed and experienced the trauma of my family/relatives cutting eachother's hearts out and eating them (metaphorically speaking) over a family business, and with my anxiety disorder I find it extremely hard to have positive dreams let alone accomplish them.       There are too many crimes, too many huge cities sorrounding, and too many people who only care about themselves and not anyone else. I feel like a failure for saying this, but I don't have the strength to deal with this. I feel like a walking corpse who can't hold on to one solitary hope. Taken depression medications before, due to a chemical imbalance - and all they've done is cause me long-term heartache, physical problems, emotional indifference, and money.      I'd be willing to buy a house that is a fixer-upper as long as it has a working bathroom, sturdy walls, a good foundation (and a must is a hospital or local physician that is atleast 15-30 minutes away)

I’m also worried I’m not ‘techie' enough to succeed at this.

Hi all - that sinking feeling when you realise you have a leak and its between the meter and your property - yep I have that...

As I understand my buildings cover should cover this (excess payable).      Not sure where the leak is having only found out we have a leak (Stopped mains and dial is spinning away plus we have used an unreasonable amount of water in a very short space of time) We do know its between meter and the internal stop ****. But thats 3 different rooms and a driveway in between! So somewhere along the line....theres a leak.       Also anyone else who has had this problem....how was the pipe repaired and did they dig internal floors and the driveway up to fix?      Any info (Sensible) would be most appreciated. I have turned all water off at the meter now to stop another load of water seeping off somewhere...

I have just followed a link to a website:    http://www.myhome-myoffice.com/our-story...       Where they use an urban legend (the story reads like it is truth) to try to promote their business idea.  Follow the link and see what I mean.      Having only some very basic knowledge of biology their 'Our Story' only served to make my nose turn up in disgust and tell them so!      I wrote:   Actually, eagles do not lose their beak or talons, unless by extreme action. The Eagle Rebirth is a Urban Legend and its not true. Normally, losing its beak means death by loss of blood. Eagles, like all other animals, cannot "Choose" to extend their lifespan by any means, and live normally till 30 years old. So "NO", eagles do not put out their beaks and talons and cannot support 5Months of starvation.(They are not bears for christ sake)        Do you, like me, think that using some urban legend as obviously preposterous as this is just not a good idea to promote a business?

Today I check our account and it has a $0.00 balance and after my near death experience, I was able to compose myself enuff to contact my bank. Turns out a levy was placed on our account for credit card debts my wife had years ago (even before we met). How can this be possible when I had nothing to do with it and why now? Is it because now we are married, thus I have also married her debt? Something just seems really illegal here and now I am royally screwed with no Vaseline. Does anyone know the correct way to dispute this cause I just have a feeling it's gonna be a losing battle, especially if I don't dispute it "the right way!"

My dad got a doctors note in 1995 saying he can't work on the heaters at bridgestone firestone because he blacked out twice.  Now recently they wanna put him back on and he showed them his doctors note from 95 and they said it has to be more recent.  So he got a new doctors note and showed the firestone nurse.  She said this could cost you your job and that they might need more info before they don't put him on the plant.  So the doctor said if they need more info tell them to fax us.  Then my dad talked to a Union worker and he said if they want to they will just lay you off.  Is there anything he can do?  He hasn't blacked out since being off the heaters and there are other disabled people there(i.e. a guy with one eye, so he can't drive the fork truck).

I signed a six-month tenancy agreement for a flat but there was a mix up with a cheque I paid the letting agency which means I haven't paid them the six-months rent in advance I agreed to, and more importantly, maybe, the deposit I'm supposed to pay before I can sign the tenancy agreement (the women who I met and signed the agreement with didn't know about my failed check). Am I able to back out of the tenancy agreement due to not paying the deposit first?
