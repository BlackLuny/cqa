I noticed that when I am sick, my anxiety levels increase.  I don't have full-blown attacks, but I'll get the beginning symptoms.  I just got over a sinus infection and bronchitis.  I noticed I was having more anxiety during that time than I usually do.  I woke up this morning with an earache and soar throat.  I was feeling a little anxious about that, but not enough to take my medication.        Has anyone else had this happen?  I'm wondering if I'm having this because my body is trying to fight of whatever it is I have.  I may end up going back to the doctor this week.  I may need another round of antibiotics.  (I have a history of sinus trouble).  Any answers you have would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, and God bless!

At the beginning of the track season, right after I would run I would throw up..Ive never had this problem before until this year. It has gotten worse though.Lately I've been throwing up during the meets! It slows me down at least 10 seconds, and there is no way I can just hold it in. Not only is it embarassing, but it kept me from getting to state in the 800m relay..unfortunatly we DID make it in the 3200 relay..So the next time I throw up, it will be in front of hundreds of ppl..and it will slow our time down alot..I CANT have this happen again, especially if its going to let my girls down.       I KNOW Im not out of shape. Ive been working hard this whole season..but then what else can it be? Is there something wrong with me?Someone told me it may be my sinuses.Is there anything I can do or anything I can take to help me not puke during the race and humiliate myself?! please help!

Two orange 30mg pills, once in the morning and one in the afternoon each day.  My psychiatrist has diagnosed me with ADHD (the lazy kind not hyper), OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder), and some Anxiety and Depression problems.  I'm going to cut strait to the point to not make this long:  Got prescribed to 20 mg of adderall per day on December 17. Didn't do much, a week later, he told me to take 30mg each day, did work but left me restless and inattentive by 1:00 P.M. because I take it at 7:00 A.M. So on January 2, he put me on 60 mg of Adderall. Worked fantastic started doing my work and completing my homework.  It also has done wonders for my Anxiety and Depression.  But now almost exactly 1 month, I don't feel anything. I took my 2nd dose today at 2:30 P.M. and all it did was me feel tired. Should I take a break from it or continue taking it to make it as effective as it was.

20090203132106AAsnYBs	Health;Mental Health	Is this the appropriate diagnosis of Antisocial personality disorder? Intentionally harming animals young age?	My father talks about how he used to light cats' tails on fire as if it were normal, I diagnosed him with Antisocial Personality Disorder. He went on about how he used to shoot them with BB guns as well.       When I called him out on this abnormal behavior, he said did it as a kid, that doesn't count.       I said in the DSM the criteria is based on those behaviors as a child and how they get worse when the person gets older - as he is clearly getting worse with his psychotic behavior. He now shoots blue jays and squirrels, and I won't even get into how he torments PEOPLE.      So case in point - he got worse as he got older, he really had no response to this.      Was that the appropriate diagnosis/response to his outrageous comments?      What would you do if someone talked like that as if it were normal behavior?      I have administered the SCID diagnosis for ASPD for years, so I know that is a factor.      Please answer if it is correct diagnosis and please no comment about how I shouldn't diagnose people to their face, as this man is truly one sick puppy and needed to hear it.

My friends today were saying that you can actually eat the wrapper of Stride gum.  :P      They do it all the time, but I never wanted to, I was kinda freaked out.  But today I did, and it didn't seem like such a big deal.  It made the gum a little harder, but that's not that important.      They also say that it's actually edible?!  Is this true??      I am still chewing the gum right now and I can't taste or feel the wrapper.      So, can you really eat it??  And is it REALLY edible??      Thanx!! :)

I look fat and jokingly get called fat at school. I laugh but it annoys me.   I dont know how many calories I eat in a day but I know they are over 2000. I want to stop eating and eat healthy but I have no self-determination. I dont eat breakfast because I cant eat that early in the morning so I snack during the morning. I dont have lunch because I eat something at 11 at school.      My day goes:      Bag of crisps   Chocolate bar   lucozade orange sport   samosa   iced bun   bag of crisps   chocolate bar   dinner   bowl of cereal   chocolate bar.      I have no self determination and I say to my self that I wont eat something but i always do. I cant make myself exercise because I am not determined enough to make myself do it.      What do I do?

20090203131718AADg62W	Health;Mental Health	Depression and anxiety symptoms?	For the past 2 months now I have not been myself AT ALL. It literally started when I woke up feeling weird and foreign one morning, that day I had trouble connecting with friends and family, especially my bf, whom from I felt detached. The month of December I spiraled out of control, crying all of the time, very rarely feeling peace, missing school, not talking to friends and have issues with my connection with my boyfriend and my art, which were both very important to me. I had panic attacks a few times with the friends I did keep talking to...the attacks have lessened, but I still feel as if I cannot tell my boyfriend or my best friends that I love them. I tried painting for the first time since November a few days ago, my lack to paint with anything aside from the color blue and the detachment that I felt towards my paints made me cry. I can function now- but barely. Even when it seems like nothing is wrong (my bestfriends, boyfriend and family are faithful, loving and amazing) I cannot enjoy ANY activity because I have this sense of almost impending doom in the back of my head, mostly directed towards my boyfriend- my detachment towards him is the strongest (and we are the closest!), its not like I am worried that he will leave me or anything like that, it's like a constant underline anxiety that I do not love him anymore because of this detachment i have had, but the thought of dumping him makes me even more sad...   I don't enjoy anything that I once did and EVERYONE  has said I have changed. I even cried secretly on Christmas because I couldn't connect with my family or the gifts they gave me.

I went to the doctor and he put me on some antibiotics for chest congestion and a severe sinus infection.  I have been drinking a lot of water- Like 3- 34 oz. bottles a day.        Last night I started getting really bad leg cramps (in the calves of both legs).  I know it can't be from exercise, because I have been too tired/sick to do anything this week.   My dad had the same problem last summer.  He was drinking lots of water, but he was still getting leg cramps.  He started drinking Gatorade, and it really helped his cramps.         So is it possible to drink lots of water, but still get dehydrated because you are not getting the electrolights that are in drinks like Gatorade and Powerade,  or is it something else?

I have tried talk therapy.  Nothing has helped.  Every day I am sad.  I also have had a head injury which affected the left-frontal lobe of my brain.  I had no idea that I had a brain injury until 2006, when it showed up on an MRI.  I fell and landed on my face between five and 10 years ago, but I never lost consciousness or had a concussion or even a headache.  (I did go to see the doctor because I scraped my forehead--but I have had no usual symptoms of brain injury.) My neurosurgeon mentioned only a slightly increased chance of seizures from this injury, not sadness that never goes away.  I am 61 years old.  Nothing about life interests me now, but I would like to feel better.  What can I do?

20070516115707AABQUsc	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	What did I do to my leg / knee?	A week ago, while running to first base in a softball game, I felt a slight pop on the back, outside part of my left knee.  I didn't feel any pain with the pop, nor did I hear anything.      For the next few days, my leg was very sore when I tried to bend it, but the pain did not worsen and I had no swelling.  I noticed that two days afterwards, the upper, outside part of my calf, the area behind my knee, and the lower backside of my thigh had turned black and blue.  It looks like the discoloration is starting to go away now, and my leg feels like it's getting back to normal, though it's still tight.      My first question is this:  When sitting down with my legs bent, there is a muscle on the outside part of my uninjured leg that has a lot of tension on it and seems to connect my thigh to my knee.  On the injured leg, I can still feel this muscle, but there isn't nearly the same amount of tension on it.  Is this bad and what does it mean?      Second question:  What the heck did I do to this leg?

Now the Kinsey report I read years ago disputes this fact. They said that some guys simple have more of their non-erect penis showing then other guys. Some guys carry more of the penis inside and when they get an erection, more of it comes out. They call being hungg a "shower" versus a grower.       So which is it?

When I got a re-scheduled appointment I went to get my 3 month pack of Microgynon, but because I was getting bad side effects the nurse put me on Marvelon (28day pill).    My last period was on the 4th of Jan and the last time I had sex was on the 21st Jan. My period was due on the Friday 1st Feb.    The thing is when I was on the Ovral L in January I forgot that for 7 days after taking the 21 pills I'm not supposed to take any pill...Instead I started Marvelon right after the 21 pills and that was on Monday 28th Jan.    Since Friday, instead of my period I've been experiencing red dots or blotches which I've been told is breakthrough bleeding. I've also read that breakthrough bleeding might be a sign of pregnancy!

I've never had a high libido, but it seemed normal and I often felt aroused by him.  Now however, I just don't seem to get aroused.  I sometimes feel like I could go the rest of my life without sex and not really miss it.  It's not my husband, and I often blame exhaustion, but that isn't always the case.  Also, it doesn't feel good anymore when he rubs my breasts.  I used to love the feeling, but now there's nothing.      Have any of you other women experienced this?  Does it come back?  Its been two years since our last child was born.  There was a period afterwards where we barely had sex, but we've gotten back to having it on a regular basis, but it is mostly because he wants to.      This really bothers my husband because he thinks I don't find him desirable anymore.  He actually thought I might be sleeping around on him.      I want my libido and sensitivity back also.  Any suggestions?

20080401040929AAp9iaC	Health;Women's Health	Symptoms when coming of Microgynon (the Pil)?	I'm 30 years old and have been on the contraceptive pil Microgynon since I was 18.    For a few years now I've had irregular periods, mood swings, depression and a lack of sex drive. My doctor suggested a couple of years ago that it would be a good idea to come off the pil because I'd been taking it for so long, and look into other methods of contraception; for health reasons I stopped taking it after my last cycle (about 2 weeks ago). My moods are starting to feel more consistant and calmer, I cry less at silly things, my sex drive is back (WOO HOO!) and I haven't bled at all yet! All is going well, but I am suffering from some mild to moderate stomach cramps and tummy aches and my appetite is not as good as it was. Has anyone else been on the pil for a long time and come off it? I'd very much like to know if what I'm experiencing is quite normal. Many thanks.

20080402160624AAy2K4I	Health;Women's Health	Birth Control? Pain During Sex? Yeast Infections?	I started on ortho tricyclen lo when I was 17 (21 now) and I just recently stopped taking it. I had all kinds of odd symptoms. Can someone tell me if it's normal/if they had similar experiences? What they/the doctor did to rectify them? What form of birth control is best for these symptoms?   1) I would frequently get yeast infections, at first even when I was taking the pill properly and then when I missed pills. I rarely used condoms either. I'm wondering if it could have been the hormones in the pill, my boyfriends ejaculate, or a combination that gave me infections?    2) I would often get sore and sex would hurt very often no matter how much lubrication I produced. It felt like I had sores in the opening of my vagina and artificial lubricants and my boyfriends ejaculate would burn both inside and out. Now that I have stopped birth control pills it hasn't been burning nearly as badly. What kind of birth control can I use that wont cause this to happen?

I have had heavy periods, sharp pelvic pain and heavy bleeding in between periods for almost a year now. I have seen an OB/GYN who did an ultrasound and laparoscopy to see if I had endometriosis or fibroids, etc. She said she found nothing during these procedures. I have already been on 4 different birth control pills in the last year to try to control this and nothing has helped. I have read info about adenomyosis which says it is hard to diagnose even with laparoscopy and was wondering if that might be my problem. Does anyone know anything about adenomyosis or have any suggestions for these problems. I was also wondering if I do have adenomyosis, does it affect your fertility? Any help would be appreciated!

20081014115144AA5HTMn	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Should I be concerned about this recurring pain or not?	Hello, Y!Answers community.      For perhaps a year and a half now, I've had very rare but recurring pain.  I'd say I've had it four times total, this morning being the last "attack," if you will.      In short, the pain is in the lower left side of my torso, almost centered and just above the juncture of thigh to hip/groin/mons and so on.  It's not a cramp; it's more like a stabbing, burning sensation which is extremely intense: I can't stretch out or stand up into a straight position, and it has in the past caused a tingling sensation in my urethra and a sensation that I have to pee {but I don't}.      Originally, I thought UTI gone bad, but the pain clears up in four to six hours and leaves me with no other problems.  I also considered a STI, but I've only had two partners, never with PIV intercourse, and I was the first girl for the both of them to go beyond kissing.  Beyond that, I have no issues with rashes or funky discharge.      A nurse said the pain was most likely just an Ovarian cyst bursting, and I had an ultrasound done to see what was up.  However, today the pain occurred on the fifth day of my period, which didn't match up what the nurse explained to me.      In short, please help.  Should I see a doctor?  Does anyone know what these symptoms signal?      Any information is dearly appreciated.

Does the fat get worked off, along with an increase in muscle, or does the fat just stay there, with an increase of underlying muscle?

I know I satisfy her sexually, but I lack confidence because I feel like I am not big enough.  I don't even want my wife to see or hear about a well endowed guy.  It is affecting my self esteem and from what I have read, I am above average--nearly 7" long and over 5.5" around.  This is something I have struggled with for years and want to overcome.  I'm afraid it's affected my confidence in every other aspect of my life.  I think about it all the time and I am generally unhappy.  I want to know if anyone else has these same insecurities and if they have found a way to get over it.  For women, would you be satisfied?

20081027180629AAJoP56	Health;Diet & Fitness	I want to lose 50 pounds and I found a diet- do you think it will work? plz skim and answer!?	To lose weight in 5 months, follow this simple diet routine, proved to be more effective:      General Motors Weight Loss Diet, a.k.a. The GM Diet* - An e-mail received from Shri M Siddique (who recd from Ravindra Jaju)   Have you heard of the Physics Diet? As common sense goes, prevention is always better than cure!   The following diet and health program was apparently developed for the employees and the dependants of General Motors Inc.    The program was developed in conjunction with the grant from the US Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. It was first tried at the Johns Hopkins Research Centre and was approved for distribution by the Board of Directors of General Motors Corporation at a general meeting on August 15, 1995 .    General Motors Corporation wholly endorsed this program and is making it available to all employees and families. This program will be available at all General Motors Food service facilities.    It is the management’s intention to facilitate a welfare and fitness program for everyone.    This program is designed for a target weight loss of 5-6 Kgs. per week. It will also improve your attitude and emotions because of its systematic cleansing effects. The effectiveness of this seven day plan is that the foods eaten burn more calories than they give to the body in caloric value. This plan can be used as often as you like to without any fear of complications. It is designed to flush your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well being. After seven days you will begin to feel lighter by atleast 10 pounds. You will have an abundance of energy and an improved disposition.    During the first seven days you must drink 10 glasses of water each day.    DAY ONE    All fruits except bananas. Your first day will consists of all fruits you want. It is suggested you consume lots of watermelon and cantaloupe.    DAY TWO    All vegetables. You are encouraged to eat until you are stuffed with all the new and cooked vegetables of your choice. There is no limit on the account or type. Avoid oil and coconut while cooking vegetables. Have large boiled potato for breakfast.    DAY THREE   Any mixture of fruits and vegetables of your choice. Any amount, any quantity. No bananas yet and no potatoes today.    DAY FOUR    Bananas and milk. Today you will eat as many as eight bananas and drink three glasses of milk. You can also have one bowl of vegetables soup.    DAY FIVE    Today is a feast day. You will eat 1 (one) cup of rice. You also have to eat 6 (six) whole tomatoes and drink 12 (twelve) glasses of water today to cleanse your system of the excess uric acid you will be producing.    DAY SIX    Today is another all vegetables day. You must eat 1 cup of rice today and eat all the vegetables you want cooked and uncooked to your heart's content.    DAY SEVEN    Today your food intake will consist of 1 cup rice, fruit juice and all the vegetables you care to consume. Tomorrow morning you will be five to eight kilograms lighter than 1 week ago. If you desire further weight loss, repeat the program again. Repeat the program as often as you like, however, it is suggested that you rest for three days before every repetition.    You have your system under control now and it will thank you for all the purging and cleansing you just gave it. Even more than a diet program it is good to follow this diet once in a while to clean your digestive system and remove toxic substances that have a accumulated in the system.   ADDITIONAL COMMENTS   The most important element of the program is the 10 (ten) tall glasses of water a day. You can also flavour the water will some lemon to make the drink easier. While on the program, take only black coffee and never more than one teaspoon of oil. Preferably do not use oil because the high calorific content. No fruit juices before day seven.    Here is what happens to you body while you are on this program and how and why it works.    Day 1: You are preparing your system for the upcoming program. Your only source of nutrition is fresh fruits. Fruits are nature's perfect food. They provide everything you can possibly want to sustain life except total balance and variety.    Day 2: Starts with a fix complex carbohydrates in the form of a boiled potato. This is taken in the form of a boiled potato and taken in the morning to provide energy and balance. The rest of the day too consists of vegetables which are virtually calories free and provide essential nutrients and fibre.    Day 3: Eliminates the potato because you get your carbohydrates from fruits. Your system is now prepared to start burning excess pounds. You will have cravings, which should start to diminish by day four.    Day 4: Bananas and milk. You are in for a surprise. You probably will not be able to eat all the bananas allowed. But they are there for the potassium you have lost and the sodium you may have missed during the last three days. You will notice a definite loss of desire for sweets and you will be surp

20081104194115AATDuI1	Health;Men's Health	Being bullied, what should I do?	I'm a sophomore in highschool, I'm 6'2 and 220lbs, and this little kid is really pissing me off.  I try to avoid him as much as possible but for some reason he really hates me, and he's like a hemorrhoid up my asshole, no matter how much I try to ignore him or avoid him, he's always there to annoy me.       So anyways, I am sitting down at lunch with a girl friend of mine, the other kid's girlfriend comes and sits 1 chair away from me, my bag is on the chair separating us, we are sitting at a round table with separate chairs.  So we are doing fine, us 3 and 1 other guy, when her boyfriend shows up.  He is 5'5 and maybe 135lbs, he comes up and says 'Hey Jew'.  I say, what did you just call me?  He then says 'Move your bag'.  I say No.  Then he takes my bag, throws it on another table, puts his bag in the chair, and walks away.  Then my friend is saying Don't get mad, Don't get mad, but I just get up, say I gotta go, take his bag and throw it 20 feet across the cafeteria.  I know tomorrow I'm gonna have to encounter him again, I know I could easily kick his *** but I don't wanna be suspended...I was thinking just grabbing him by his shirt collar and giving the most intimidating expression ever to him and telling his little *** to show some respect.        What would you guys do in my situation?

I closely watched this for about a week and it started to progress and make him uncomfortable to a point where I had to go in to see the Dr. who said that it is eczema and odered pramasone (a topical cream) for it.

20070819140152AAm8c4K	Health;Diet & Fitness	Quien me convida un yogur con bacterias adelgazantes?	LONDRES (New Scientist).- Desde hace mucho tiempo se sabe que la flora intestinal cambia con la edad, la dieta y otros factores. Así, hay una diferencia significativa en la tasa de grupos microbianos entre los bebes alimentados a pecho y los que toman biberón. "En los primeros, la colonia es cualitativamente menos patógena", dice Wilson.       La metagenomía ha permitido revelar algunas asombrosas relaciones entre la microflora y la salud humana. Jeffrey Gordon, de la Universidad de Washington en St. Louis, utilizó la metagenomía para revelar que los obesos tienen una tasa de firmicutas y bacteroidetes -gérmenes presentes en el intestino- más alta que los delgados, lo que sugirió que la obesidad pudiera estar ligada con una habilidad incrementada para absorber nutrientes del intestino, gracias a la tasa de los microbios allí alojados.       Cuando los obesos fueron puestos en una dieta de baja calorías, la proporción de bacteroidetes aumentó acercando su perfil microbiano al de la gente delgada. En otro estudio, Gordon identificó a un posible candidato para una intervención terapéutica: el Methanobrevibacter smithii, presente en el intestino e importante para la digestión de azúcares complejos que no pueden ser degradados por las enzimas humanas.       Los ratones obesos tienen más M. Smithii en sus intestinos que los delgados, y cuando Gordon transplantó esa colonia en ratones con intestinos estériles, aumentaron de peso más que otros ratones a los que se les dio microflora intestinal de ratones delgados.       Ahora, Gordon ha secuenciado el genoma del M. Smithii como un primer paso hacia la manipulación de su presencia en el intestino, y quizás hacia el ataque contra la obesidad.
