20090226100656AAUC8oA	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	What is the best solution for this car dilemna?	It looks as if I'm going to have to get another car.  I have a truck that keeps falling apart,  I am so tired of spending my hard earned money on it and then having it break down on me.  Yesterday I tried to start it, and it cranked but wouldn't start.      I've been saving my money for a long time because I was planning on taking a trip and going back to school this year and I suffered a lot for my money.  I can't bear to wipe out all my savings I worked hard for on that piece of crap again.  It's not worth the hundreds of dollars it's gonna cost to fix.  I am so sick and tired of working all my life for nothing, no clothes, no vacations, no dreams, nothing but hard labor and investing all my money in the truck.  Not worth it.      My dilemna is, how am I going to get a car?        There are some problems.  First of all, I have saved my money because there are some other things I need and I can't spend much money on a used car.        Second, this semester I have been substitute teaching, and I don't know of a way that I can finance car payments or a lease because most places want you to have a guaranteed income.      I am so frustrated!  I'm so sick of working my life away, doing without things and not getting anywhere.  I've been doing without for so long and I don't want to wipe out my savings, only to have the damn truck break down on me again.  I really need a car, but how??      If you can help me thanks.

20090226100653AALhTfJ	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	My subs won't play, everything is new and hooked  up right. Can you help?	I just purchased everything I will need to put a system in my 1987 e30 bmw.     System includes:   -Two 12" JL subs   -Monster cables 8 gauge   -600watt Visonik (4 channel V304xt) amp   (  http://www.sonicelectronix.com/pictures....  )   -Jenson MP6212      A friend of mine helped me with the installation.  Here's what I have done:      1.) RCA cables hooked in the rca slot on the back of the head unit as well as the amp.      2.) The REM wire is hooked up to the amp.  It is also connected to the 2 red accessory wires coming from head unit and the car.      3.) The subs are wired to the speaker wire inputs on the amp.      4.) The ground wire is connected to the negative terminal on the battery (I did this because I couldn't find a ground spots in the trunk. Plus the thick 6" brown wire coming from the negative terminal is directly connected to a bolt in the chassis.      5.) Amp 12v wire hooked up (w/ fuse) to positive terminal on battery (battery is in the trunk).  Also hooked up to the 12v input on the amp.      After hooking it up, it worked for only a few minutes, then stopped.  No fuses looked blown, but I replaced them all.  I checked all the connections and re-connected all the wires.  Tried 3 different RCA cables. When I turn the car on now, only the red logo light comes on on top of the amp.  When it was working fine, the white power light came on as well.  The head unit works fine, the battery, cables, and amp is new.  Could part of the amp be fried? The REM and 12v are working fine, but the amp seems to be getting no audio signal from the headunit.

I still owe $48,000 on the cayman S, so ill have a negative equity of $4,000. How do haggle with them to give me a lower price on the 911 turbo? overall, i want a lower price on the 911 turbo and maybe a high trade in price on my car. what should i be doing? what is more worth it? keeping the cayman or trading it in for the 911 turbo.       specs: cayman S is a rwd loaded, and 911 is awd loaded.

20090226103425AAYKyjC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Is there more than one compressor in a car? Would it cause the fan to come on if it's bad?	I know to many of you this will seem like  very stupid questions, but I really don't know the answer.. Does a car have more than one compressor?  I know it has a compressor for the A/C .  What happens when/if this compressor goes bad?  Does it affect your heating system too?  Would it make any kind of a noise if the compressor went bad? Like a fan running all of the time?  A few years ago, I was told that the compressor in my car was going bad. Recently when I turned the car on from a dead cold start (it had been sitting for 12 hours) what sounded like the fan came on as soon as I turned the heater and defroster on.  I turned them off, and the fan stayed on the entire time i drove the car, never shutting down once - until I turned the car off.  I took the car to the mechanic twice and he claims there's nothing wrong.  Now, I'm going to try a new mechanic, but I'm just curious to know if the compressor may have something to do with it.
20090226103102AAUznJz	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Rumors of International buying Jeep?	The article spawned from JP magazine's April edition. It states a lot of positive changes and hopes for Jeep, but it seems to be an April fool's joke. I've done some research and there are many mixed thoughts, but no solid evidence; most people think it's a joke.       Honestly, it would be a Godsend if this happened because it will detach Jeep from Chrysler and put an end to their shenanigans (which I will not list due to the sheer number of them *ehhem*IFS Wrangler*ehhem*).       This is also made less realistic due to the fact that International only produces commercial vehicles and farming implementations.       What are your thoughts?

I can't report him to the company as the company solely consists of just him and one other instructor, i'm looking for a website where i can put a review of the company and instructor or something   thank you

20090226121112AAroVW5	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car runs fine and suddenly dies...Fuel pump?	My 5 speed, '94 Honda Accord, runs fine and all of a sudden the engine has been dying. I roll to the side of the road, shut the ignition, restart the engine, and it runs fine. This happened three times over two weeks of daily driving. I've literally driven over a hundred miles with no problem and then out of nowhere, my tach drops to zero and the engine dies.    Could it be the fuel pump, a blocked filter, or what? If it is the fuel pump, would it keep restarting as it does?   Any suggestions? Somehow I know if I go to a mechanic blindly, they will automatically tell me it needs a fuel pump and charge me accordingly. (If I could afford a fuel pump, I wouldn't be driving a 15 year old car...)

20090226162546AApkd8n	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	Why does my oil light blink on and off? (01 Dodge Neon)?	During all kinds of driving my car's oil light never turns on. However if I drive an extended period about 30 miles and then come to a complete stop my oil light turns on and turns off and turns on and turns off. When I start moving again the oil light turns off and remains off until I come to another stop. I've checked my oil and it's at max so I know it's not low on oil and my engine is not heating up past it's normal temperature. What could be the problem? Oil pump maybe?

20090226164815AAd8oI8	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Do you think this is wrong?	ok so im buying a car really soon, like tomorrow.   and well im not too sure about the guy im buying it from.   he keeps changing when he wants to sell it. i saw the car monday and he said that saturday morning would be fine to buy it but then he says he absolutly has to have it sold by friday then he says we could do it thursday(today) instead and then calls today saying that the title and liscense place will be open til 730 then calls back saying that its closed. so now were doing it friday(tomorrow). also when i looked at the car it was so dirty! you would think if a guy was tryin to sell a car he would at least have the decency to cean it a bit. also it was previously a student driving car that he taught sudents with so it has glue all over the exterior of the car from the learners stickers.    and he keeps saying what a great deal he's giving me, when really its just in okay deal. he wants $6,000 for a used  4 cylinder 05  kia rio that is extremely basic, meaning no automatic windows, locks, or mirrors. also the breaks dont seem right. i took it for a test drive and i had to push really hard on them for them to work. i dont know am i right to be a little uneasy or am i worrying for nothing?      im just getting really frustrated with everything thats going on.

20090226155200AAa3VeL	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Hit by an Uninsured Driver!?	Ok, on Monday Feb. 23rd 2009, I was out of town on Vacation, I lent my girlfriend my car while I was out, she is 25 and had full permission to use the vehicle(2008 civic coupe)   She was at a local applebees restaurant parked when a ford f-150 reversed into her causing severe damage to my door.    Now I have full coverage all state insurance. The young man the struck my car stated at the time he had insurance but as he just bought the vehicle, the insurance is still under the previous owners name. The police were called, but since this was on private property and there were no injuries they refused to go to the scene.   I have since got an estimate for $1374.95 worth in repairs. I have contacted the young man and he is not returning my calls, nor my text messages. The day of the accident he called me and explained that he would rather pay out of pocket and not get the insurance companies involved...   Now that im stuck with this bill, what should I do?
20090226155219AAOsEve	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car kept shutting itself off when I was driving.?	It is 2000 Chev cavaliar. Today, after I stopped for a traffic light for about 1 minute, my car just shut itself off out of no where. I tried to restart it, and it worked, but after a minute, when I was still driving this time, it did it again. So I did the same thing, and it shut itself off after a minute.  That kept happening until I made it home.I was only a few blocks away. When I got my friend come over to take a look, my car worked just fine like nothing had been wrong. and it was only 5 minutes after the last shutting off happened.  and one more thing, when the car was shutting off, the engine oil warning light was on for two seconds, and then everything was just gone, but after I restarted the car, the light would be off until the car started shutting off again. So what is wrong with my car? Hope I can get some help here.

20090226160309AASwMol	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	1974 Honda XL 100 trouble running...?	I just bought a 74 XL 100 a couple of days ago, so I'm not sure about any previous problems.  The bike will start and idle fine, but it doesn't respond to me twisting the throttle.  It usually bog's down and cuts off.  I also just replaced the spark plug because it was fouled out.      It seems to start fine, but it just won't go anywhere.  The previous owner mentioned that he just installed a new carb.  He bought it from the Honda dealership, and the name brand of it starts with a "K".  He said that it wouldn't start for him and he thought the carb needed adjustment ... but he didn't know how to do it, and that's why he was selling it.        I haven't checked the valves like someone mentioned before ... could that be issue?  I'm new to bikes so I'm not sure what gremlins normally pop up.  Any ideas?

20090226161142AATt4Ff	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;GMC	Wouldn't it be better to let GM go bankrupt?	The US government already loan GM some 15 billion US dollars. Now, GM is again asking for such a same amount again. That's 30 billion dollars!!!. There are 224.000 people working at GM. Wouldn't it be better just to close GM and give those 224.000 people a social welfare income (for example 1.000 dollar per month)? This would cost only 2,6 billion per year, not even taken to the fact that several tens of thousands of those former employees would find another job. For the 15 billion US dollar GM needs the government can give all those employees for 5,7 years a social welfare income. Far more time than GM still has.

The sub set up was given to me as a present, and I'm trying to find an amp to power it. It is a 10" Compvr Kicker that is labeled as dual 2 ohm voice coils. Because there are two 2 ohm voice coils in series (I am assuming they are in series), wouldn't this lead to a total impedance of 4 ohms? I apologize for the vagueness, all I have to go by is what is on the back of the speaker itself. The link shows which one it is       http://www.google.com/products/catalog?h...
