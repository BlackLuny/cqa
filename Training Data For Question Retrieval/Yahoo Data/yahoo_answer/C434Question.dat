Please advise me, my boiler both heating & water seems to have a mind of its own,, it chooses to come on when it feels like it.

20090307233257AA5VpYg	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Should I use fabric spray paint?	I have a pair of stretchy jeans (99% cotton and 1% spandex) and I don't know if I should use fabric spray paint or dye them back to black. They were originally black but after a few washes they have become gray. I was looking online and it seems like fabric dye can stain a washing machine even if its made specifically for machine wash dyeing. I wanted to avoid the whole mess by just buying the Fabric Spray Paint and spraying my jeans black but the websites show that people used the paint just to paint designs, not make something darker except Upholstery spray paint. Should I dye or paint? Both said the color is permanent. But the paint says that it washes off your hands easily with soap and water...why not fabric?
