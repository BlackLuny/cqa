20090203101439AAZwh4I	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Would this be a credible and legitamate legal argument:?	Pornography does NOT fit the definition of speech in the first ammendment. Why? Because speech does not include the involuntary physical response caused by pornography. For example, when you argue with someone and state your stance, the other person has a voluntary choice what to do with the information. In contrast, when you are exposed to pornography, you may manifest an erection or experience a secretion of bodily fluids against your will. Therefore, pornography does not fit the definition of speech.      Instead, it possibly may fit the definition of a medical device. In which case, it would be possible to enforce laws against it's distribution without FDA approval.      Would this be a possible measure against the flagrant abuse of pornography and it's distributors in America?

Israel says US-Iran talks should be "short" since the use of military force against Iran during the negotiations would be "difficult."      Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Monday that once the new administration of President Barack Obama started dialogue with Tehran over its disputed nuclear program, any efforts to militarily take out Iranian nuclear facilities would become more difficult.   "We'll see Iranian gestures and steps aimed at pushing off the issue," Barak said, while adding that any dialogue between Tehran and Washington should be "relatively short, and followed by deep sanctions."    http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=859...

This might sound really silly... but I've seen/heard about soo many women with no job yet keep having children that the taxpayers have to pay for. It's ridiculous how much it ends up costing other people and a lot of these kids grow up in bad conditions because of their irresponsible parents.      Would it be ethical if there was a new practice for the government to keep people on welfare with at least one child to protect against further pregnancy? Like, say there is a girl with a baby that she is getting money from the government for... what if the government paid for said girl to be implanted with a Mirena (a small, long-term birth control option without sterilization that can be removed at any time)? It would cost less to do this than the thousands of unwanted and uncared for children born into welfare. If the women had a choice, and were told, say, that if they DO get pregnant again they will see a decrease in their benefits and perhaps get their kids taken away, would the taxpayer at least save some money and control population, especially in bad areas?

The male cop just gave him a ticket for going 10 over the speed limit and one female cop pulled him over for going 4 over the speed limit but this one struck him with her nightstick when he reached for the glove box after she screamed "vehicle registration". another female cop did a search on him but when he asked for  her for her badge id she pepper sprayed him.      i also dont think he is a liar cause he has never lied, even when it got him in some difficult situations. so is there a difference between male and female cops in how they handle themselves?

After reporting the rape she was sent to the psych ward in Germany and eventually transferred back to the US.   The man that raped her is coming back from Iraq in a week and going to be on her base. She requested a Hardship transferred that was denied. She is now fearful for her life and does not want to be murdered like Maria Lauterbach was.   They never believed that the raped happen and is trying to say that she is "crazy" and they may even charge her for "false report"   I am sure she is not lying. She loves the Army more than anything and even transferred to a unit to be sent to Iraq.   How can she get transferred? We contacted the Congress and they were not much help. They are just reporting back what the Army is saying and that is that "she was never raped and she is lying"      She is even thinking about going AWOL and feels that even if they find her and they send her to prison at least she won't have to see the man that raped her.

I graduated in 2007 from an above average mech. engineering school, have had one job and am on the verge of being laid off.  I am currently looking into military options.  The question I have is what would be the best option for me. The limited knowledge I have says they probably pay the same and it's based on rank.     I was a 2 sport all-american football and baseball player in college, and I would prefer the most physically challenging core.  What do I look into and start researching for?  I obviously will talk to someone specifically but I need direction at this point.     If you are wondering why I'm not looking into other jobs, it's mainly because I had a hard enough time finding my first job, and with the economy how it is "now", I would rather not waste my time.  Grad school is not an option at this point, I don't want school loans that I stayed away from by playing sports.      Help appreciated.   Thanks

20090219185020AAIExaM	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Why does Obama praise Abraham Lincoln as his role model?	It is clear that Obama considers Lincoln to be a role model of equality and clearly he intends to center a part of his presidency Lincoln's policy of equality. Obama has proved this by making many statements claiming Lincoln as his role model and using Lincoln's Bible to be sworn into office.       In my opinion, all of this talk of "modeling himself after Lincoln" is completely ignorant, and simply is making himself look stupid. Lincoln was one of the biggest racists in the history of the United States and in no way stood for equality among races.   Quote from Lincoln-Douglas debate:      "  I will say here while I am upon this subject, I have no disposition to introduce political and social equality between the white and black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which in my judgment will probably forever forbid their living together on terms of respect, social and political equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there should be a superiority somewhere, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position…"- Abraham Lincoln    "I will say then, that I am not nor have ever been in favor of bringing about in any way, the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not, nor have I ever been in favor of making voters of the negroes, or jurors, or qualifying them to hold office, or having them to marry with white people…there must be the position of superior and inferior, that I as much as any other man am in favor of the superior position being assigned to the white man."       I will now reiterate a particular part of the last quote " I am not, nor have I ever been in favor of making voters of the negroes, or jurors, or qualifying them to hold office"        Ohh the sweet irony! Looks like old Lincoln would be rolling over in his grave right about now if he was still alive.         Clearly, our 44th President needs to study up on his history before he goes around saying ignorant statements and modeling himself after, perhaps, the singly most racist president in the history of the United States.

He did not give me a diet and my condition continues to deterate. I will give a documentation       January 12- I went there the first time and saw the ARNP and they were very conserning for me, then they sent me to get a chest x-ray and many blood tests (insulin level tests, glucose tolerance test, mono, and hepatitus test)  blood test done on Jan 13     January 14- meet the doctor and talked to him about my problems, he had no answer yet, he had blood work from my old doctor but got all the new blood work. Then he diagnosed me with mono ( but I have had 4 mono test and only that one came back positive). So he ordered a ultrasound of my abnominal, and a urinalysis test.     then on Jan 16- my mom took me to see him and he got all the Jan 12 tests back and said I was fat and hypercicemic and headed to type to diabetes ( I am 14) I told him I have gained weight and ate healthier and less. He then raised his voice at me and said that is not possible. He never did tell me a special diet. Then my mom mentioned a non-cancerous pancreatic tumor and he said I have not seen that in all my 8 years and gave us the bill and left the room.     Then we called him and told him I was real bad sick, but they told us they could not see us and told us to go the the ER. So we went to the ER and they gave us orders to get a MRI of the head and an EEG and they told us they would be to the doctors in 2 days. So my dad called them 3-4 business days later and they said that they had not got it yet, but my dad called th MRI department and they said it had been given to the doctor. So finally a week and a day after the tests we went there (Feb. 19)  So today we went there and we had to ask them 3 times to give us the MRI results which they did. So today we saw the ARNP and she went through my syptoms and told me that they were all becuase of hyperthroidism and was going to give me a prescribtion for it, even though all my blood tests said in a month that my TSH went up by 50 percent she decided the medicine was not necessary even though the blood tests said they were. But my symptons did were way to many to just be a thyroid problem but she said that that was it. I have high blood pressure, high pulse rate, numbness in hands and feet, headaches, vision will go blury only sometime, bad headaches, all joints hurt, my whole body is swollen, fever of 100 50 percent of the time, coughing at night, night sweats,serious fatigue, mood changes, hearing problems, less mental capacity and many other serious syptoms.But she changed her mind and said no thyroid medicine and would not adment me to the hospital. They also told me they did not know the EEG results after over a week.The she gave me some more rotine blood tests, EKG, and a urinalyis test(routine) So now I am in my bed all day long very tired and very ill. I just want this question answered no bogus please. I need to fell better but they will not help me.

20090219195615AAelUf7	Politics & Government;Politics	Should we allow gay marriage?	I was just doing some thinking and came up with a few quick questions that are open to both sides of the debate over gay marriage.  If marriage is a religious institution, how does the government have any power to recognize any marriage?  How can they give tax and legal benefits to married couples if it is a religious institution?        Why does the government give tax and legal benefits to married couples?  What is the government's interest in marriage?      The way I see it, we have two choices: recognize (at least legally) some form of gay marriage to allow those citizen equal protection under the law or stop legally recognizing any marriage to protect the separation of church and state.  Any thoughts?

Ok, so I was driving down this road right infront of my boarding school, and my friend was driving infront of me. It was at about 9:00 at night and it's in a small town so no1 was driving on the road. We had just went over the railroad tracks and I passed/overtook him. So basically I went on the other side of the road and passed him. We were not racing or anything, but still, I know it was wrong. I just was not really thinking at the time.      My question is, I saw a guy standing on the side of the road in a Sara Lee parking lot. He probably saw us drive in through the school gate too. Is it possible that like, maybe he could have called the cops and reported us? Or maybe there were cameras at the Sara Lee and they caught us? Or maybe even a cop was parked and saw us? who knows.      Is it possible for us, or me rather to get in trouble for this?      As I said, Yes, I know that I was wrong, it was very immature, and it won't happen again.

Intelligent answers are what im looking for, if you can't supply them then don't bother answering.     1. What is the current demand for corpsman in the Navy right now?    2. Pretend I have signed the paper and am in the Navy, what type of schooling and training will I receive and how long will it last before I am deployed somewhere?   3. What sort of testing is required once I am in and need to pass school to be allowed or able to deploy?    4. What are the chances of being thrown into intense warfare?    5.

20090219202304AAImDB5	Politics & Government;Military	Coast guard security clearance?	I am interested in joining the coast guard, but I have two misdemeanor charges on my record.  Both are related to smoking pot.  One occurred when I was 14 (I was really only charged with trespassing, and it's expunged).  And the other when I was 18, the charges were dismissed.  I have never been convicted of anything, except a couple of speeding tickets when I was 16.  I'm currently 23 and I have a B.A. degree in political science.  I'm only interested in being in the enlisted service, not officer training.  As would seem pretty obvious to just about any casual observer. I smoked pot from time to time when I was in high school and tried cocaine a couple times.  I Have never been addicted to anything, and have never been hospitalized, sent to counseling, or rehab for drug use, but I fear that it might be a problem.       The last thing I want to do is lie about any of this, because I don't want to get in trouble for it.      I consider myself to be a pretty smart person, and I think I would be of good use to the CG.  Were I to be accepted despite my past lapse in judgement would my past bar me from gaining certain security clearances.  I don't want to work in intelligence I would rather do operations, so what are the odds that I would need something like top secret clearance for a job in a field like rescue operations.      Also, when they conduct the interviews for top secret clearance, how many people do they usually talk to.  This part really freaks me out, because unfortunately some of my former friends don't like me very much, and I'm worried that they might be a little bit too truthful If you get what I mean?

I had my suspicions that a co-worker had been viewing my personal medical records while at work. All Medical Assistants have passwords to sign onto area hospitals medical records so we can print records of patients that have appointments with the Dr's that we each work for. We had to sign HIPPA contracts about not violating the system and viewing things that did not pertain to our job. I had it investigated and it came back that she had definately looked at my records on 2 different occassions. I went to my employer who only gave her a verbal warning and the hospital administrator revolked her privleages to access records. This co-worker brags on a daily basis that she got away with this and it upsets me because I feel like I was violated. I am unsure what my legal options are, if any. I have been actively looking for another job, because I feel that I am not being protected by my employer. Thank you for any help that is given.

20090219174503AASeohi	Politics & Government;Politics	I was thinking yesterday about President Obama increasing the troop levels in Afghanistan. I wondered what it?	is that we are after there. Their buildings and infra-structures were bombed to hell when we invaded that country to find Bin Laden. They have no real oil reserves to speak of. Most of the people live in a 13th century lifestyle so they would be useless as an allie to us.The country is mostly mountainous which is useless for agriculture. The Russians tried to take over the country and failed. They also didn't have to spend a lot of money to transport their soldiers and equipment there since they lived right over the hill so to speak.

I think that we should take out their nuclear weapon, because we know where they all are, and treat them like we did Afghanistan when we first invaded. that would be a major blow to the Taliban, possibly end the major war faster, and most importantly let every country know that the US does not sit lightly on countries that harbor or give in to terrorists.

I think that is happening to me, if anybody knows about being a lawyer and stuff, what would you do, or what do you think I should do, any body else with opinions would help also.  I have been working there for 13 years, and other people have been working there for 15 yrs.  Our new boss said that seniority counts, but it doesn't seem like she notices all of the workers who have been there for a very long time.  To her foreigners and the minority don't count.  If you are a minority in the meeting, you basically have no say in the meeting.  They have some meetings where not everyone is included we are all divided.  If you have any ideas it would be fabulous.  Thanks!

I used to have a friend some years ago, I was depressed and my grandma died and he started talking to me on a networking site (hi5.com), i started befriending him, and we used to hang out and go out, I lost a lot of my friends during that time, but he was kind of all the support i had, my mother was also going through the grieving process and she wasn't there for me, and my dad was absent. Later on, i found out that he was taking medication, antipsychotics, he told me he had been hospitalized in a psychiatrical hospital for two years cuz he had OCD and he took lsd and got into a psychotic state, and he didn't have much friends. During that time i didn't give it so much importance, but one day, i guess he had some sort of breakdown, and he told that he loved me, that i was perfect for him and some other sh*t that he loved me with my flaws and stuff, and i really freaked out. After that i told that guy that it was better if we weren't friends, that happened like two years ago. Every now and then that guy starts sending me text messages, sometimes apologizing and telling me that he thinks of me as an angel (??? i mean what's wrong with this guy), and sometimes he started insulting me telling and started making up stuff about me being a narcissist and that i was an a**hole. This guy's like 3 o 4 years older than me, he hasn't done anything with his life, and he spent most of the time locked in his room afraid of going out. He's really weird, and sometimes i get scared when he texts me, i dunno how f**ked up is his mind.       Today i got a message where he told me somthing like: (translation form spanish) "so now you have a membership to the (my social club which i've been a member since i was a child cuz of my parents, but i didn't start going until last year) club, you go around in your car and you spend the money your grandpa gives you, you're a new guy, a superior one than the poor miserable one i met, i am not worthy of you, oh pity me, so little besides ur majestuous presence, you make me sick"         WTF!!!!!!   How did he find out about the club thing!!!      So far i ignore his messages, and i've set my facebook and myspace to private so he can't contact me or see my accounts, I can't change my phone number (i dont live in the states and the phone company is kinda third world). He knows where i live, and aparently he knows more than i thought he did.      What can I do, I'm kinda nervous, and seriously i don't know what this freak is capable of.

He did almost his 3 months in boot camp when he got hurt. He fell on his back and was paralyzed for a little over a week. It eventually went away, except for part of it. He gets a disability check, however they told him after the accident that he could try to re-enlist after a year and a half.      Well its been about a year and a half, and he has been trying to make a career as a police officer. However it has not been going well. He thinks he might want to re-enlist. He says it doesnt HAVE to be the marines but he would prefer that.      We are currently trying to concieve. And I told him I think I could take him enlisting. However we came up with options we would look into like, maybe going to boot camp, and then being able to come back to Oklahoma (where we currently live) and do his schooling and stay here. Not having to move out of state, not having to stay away for a long while. Ughhhhh.... I dont know.      Is there any branch, anyway, any option he could go about this? Is military an option?

20090203103514AAvt7Si	Politics & Government;Government	Should we demand an tax audit of all the members of Congress ?	I truly believe that is is high time we as Americans DEMAND an audit of the taxes of EVERY member of the Senate and the House.      Any of them that owe back taxes should be forced to make immediate payment INCLUDING all penalties and then thrown out of office and replaced      This whole thing is out of control. How many more nominees for cabinet posts are going to have hundreds of thousands of dollars of unpaid taxes?      If I chose not to pay my taxes, I would be in prison, but these yahoos not only don't go to prison, but are rewarded with more slush money, and better paying jobs. Worse yet, all of the money they "earn" and chose not to pay their taxes on, comes from the pockets of honest, hard working American tax payers.      We deserve better for our nation and our future      Do you agree?

20090219202517AAe64gR	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can you be evicted over a few noise complaints?	Hi all, I live in Washington State, USA and today a guy came to the door and said that we needed to pack our stuff and get out, or as he said "make happy with the neighbors for being loud." This guy was not the landlord but he said he was there on behalf of the landlord. He was mildly drunk as well. Well anyway, we went around to the three neighbors (we live in a four-plex) and asked if we had caused any disturbances for them. Turns out that many of them were disturbed by our walking around (we have a top floor unit) and they were also disturbed by the closing of doors. We are all in our 20's and our neighbors are all well past there 60's. One neighbor in particular made the most complaints, about the same stuff, walking and door closing and what not. We never have parties, drink, smoke, drugs, have anyone over or anything like that. We make sure to keep any music down or any other form of disturbing noise. There were also complaints about us being nocturnal and preferring to do our laundry at night! Anyway.. the guy that came over also accused us of doing drugs, mostly because we had the chain lock on the door while talking to him. (you would to if a drunk came to the door!) He called us up soon after and said that "we better pack all our sh*t up and get the f*ck out." I found that to be extremely unprofessional and rude. We apologized again and said that there must be some kind of mis-communication. Either way we were given "our final warning" as he said. My initial question is, can we really be evicted because of noise complaints? Any information would be great. Thanks!

20090219201430AAL00N1	Politics & Government;Politics	With so many oblivious, obedient slaves, is there any hope of rolling back corporate fascism?	If I had a penny for every time I've seen or heard a conservative apologizing for or defending the corporate oligarchy, I could pay for the stimulus bill out of my own pocket.      If I had a nickel for every time I've seen or heard someone reflexively dismiss any discussion of criminal collaboration as a "conspiracy theory," I could easily pay to educate everyone in the country about how it's human nature to conspire.      If I had a dime for every time I heard or saw some slave shilling for the thugs running the immoral, obscenely wasteful "War on Drugs" - despite being forced to fund it by paying private prison operators exorbitant fees, among other things - I could send every junkie in the world to rehab.      Is there any hope for a country whose population is comprised of such dumbed-down, submissive, unquestioning, uncritical, willfully ignorant, pathetically obedient serfs? Or will we continue the slow slide into fascism, sacrificing our remaining freedoms and rights on the altar of corporate profitability?

20090219202013AAkRvWV	Politics & Government;Politics	Should the Pres have affordable payments and extend the years of the mortgage?	I understand that people bought in at the top of the market, just like many have done in the stock market.  Some say they have a mortgage for a $500,000 home which is now worth $300,000 because of all the listing on the market.  Well I a friend and his wife in San diego.  they bought one and before his hitch in the Marines ended it had gone up in price over $200,000 and this was in the 90s.        So if the people stay in the homes and pay, then the market will catch up again and prices go back up.      If we cut the mortgage, then what's the use.  they would probably stay in the home than live in a rental.  In this way the people have a home, the home is not foreclosed on and on the market driving prices down.      If we are going to allow them to cut the loss due to the market crashing, then next thing we will have to do it in the stock market for all the people who jump on to a hot stock that tops out and then falls.      This way everyone wins, even the mortgage people get their money a little longer and still get the interest and the country doesn't have to foot the bill.

20090219200802AA56YDh	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I need help to stop shoplifting, please.?	I live in a lower-class family and I have a job. I am nearly 18 years of age, and since I was 15 I have been shoplifting. I shoplifted clothing, food, makeup, shampoos and conditioners, etc...      I recently got caught by my parents because they wondered how all the expensive items kept popping up even if I'm working minimum wage. My parents have lost respect for me, and since I had been shoplifting I lost respect for myself as well.       I do not do it for a rush, for a thrill or for getting away with it and being a crook. I have a very low self-esteem and I live in a poor family and I could not obtain anything if it were not for shoplifting. I've had to shoplift face wash on many occasions, even. I have to spend money towards college and my vehicle and gas, and there is no way that I or my parents can afford much at all. I get a sense that I deserve the nice clothes I steal because I'd be wearing 3-year-old clothing if it were not for shoplifting. I feel more confident with nice clothes on, and I don't feel so poor or lousy. I was always embarrassed and tired of looking poor, and having to wear the same shirts every day. I simply got tired of it, and now a kleptomaniac is what I've become. My habit has gotten so bad that I even steal sugar packets, juice, almonds, etc. I have been stealing mindlessly and I feel that if I do not shoplift from a store, then I missed out on getting something I never could have gotten otherwise. I have become greedy and selfish, and even though I need clothing and personal care products that I simply cannot afford, I still think it is wrong, and I still want to stop. My parents think I am a liar, a thug, and a loser. I always looked up to my parents and they trusted me and never thought I would do such a thing. I let them down and in turn I let myself down even more. I envied all of the girls at school that had the wonderful outfits that were never the same every single day, or every month for that matter. I felt so terrible and low. I realized an honest poor person with nothing is better than a dishonest person with everyone. It is still very hard to deal with my addiction, and I constantly fight the urge and I always slip up. I feel like an out-of-control addict and I want help, but I am too ashamed to ask for it. Everyone will see me as a thug, and probably won't understand my situation. Please don't flame me, or tell me I'm a terrible person. I know that, and I'm taking baby steps to recovery. I AM addicted to shoplifting and the feeling of false confidence when I have makeup, nice clothes, nice body products, etc. I don't feel so worthless when I have these things, but then I think of how fake it is and it makes me feel worse. Any advice? Thank you for taking the time to read this, and please, if you're thinking of flaming me or saying ugly things, re-think it and realize that I'm really just trying to seek help. I'm a good person deep down. Thank you

Hey, I've been looking at the Airfield defense guard (air force) and noticed how you are encouraged to choose a specialty after 12 or so months of service.

Also, in the reserves (Australia again) when might I be deployed?      Thanks for any help again      P.S. Please no answers from armchair commandos, thank you

Also I plan on joining the military after college as an officer.  Either go through officer training during PLC classes for the marines or take ROTC in college and come out as an army officer and work towards becoming a ranger.  Which would be a better idea?  Also out of the military I plan on pursuing a career in law enforcement/criminal justice.      So I guess my question would be is this a good plan?  How have other people become officers in the military?  I'd like to hear some pros and cons, thanks.

Hi there, I am a 14 year old who has some questions that need answering   Let me start w/ that I think Mc.Cain was a idiot for these reasons:   He picked a V.P. from a state w/ practically NO electoral votes, that was going to go Republican anyways, and a V.P. that didn't look good to the American public, she comes off as a stupid bad-girl who everyone thought would teach Creationism in a country growing more and more atheist, who kills wolves in a country w/ growing support for animal's rights, and supported oil in a country growing hungry for alternative fuel and energy sources.   Here are my Obama questions:   1. What are his plans having to do w/ Socialism that I keep hearing of   2. What is his true religion? I hear Muslim, btw I'm atheist, but I just would like to know   3.What is his true race? I hear black white mixed, but I also hear asianblack white cross, and vice versa   4. What are his environmental plans?    5. I don't know much about Joe Biden tell me about him and why Obama picked him   I got a little mad when I saw Glenn Beck say that Obama was a Socialists and then showed a transformation to Communism

Can someone tell me if there is a taser safe enough to use on an individual who has gotten violent as a result of his handicap?  My brother is autistic and has gotten violent and hurt my mom.  My mom will absolutely NOT consider putting him anywhere besides home with her and she lives alone with him (she's 65 and he's 37).  99.999% of the time my brother is the sweetest most helpful person in the world.  But he has hurt her bad enough to put her in the hospital before and she has had to run from the house or barricade herself in a room at times when he has gotten violent.  My other brother and I are scared for her and don't know how she can protect herself if he gets like this again.  (Possibly mace?)  We've considered self-defense classes but my mom has horrible knees and can hardly keep herself on her feet, let alone restrain anyone physically.  But if she thought a taser could do permanent damage to my brother, she would never have it.  We just want something that would be powerful enough to stop him from hurting her until she could get to safety.  Any suggestions would be most welcome.

20090219202537AA9H3sd	Politics & Government;Military	I wonder what will happen now?	Okay, so here's the story. When I first started PTing with the Marines, I had on a pair of Army sweatpants (stupid, I know. I regret it too.) One of the recruiters told me not to wear other branches apparel in a Marine recruiting station. Speeding up, Wednesday, it was raining, and I had stayed over at my friends house. I needed to borrow a sweater, or a coat, and she only had those coats with the fur vs an Army sweater. So I took the sweater and flipped it inside out(You couldn't see the Army logo when it was flipped). Being stupid, I accidentally left the sweater at the recruiting office(mind you it was sleeting by the time I left) and now I'm like freaking out. I don't want people to think I want to join the Army(not that there's anything wrong with it.) I could care less if they threw out the sweater, because I told my friend I'll buy her a sweater and sweatpants to make up for it. My biggest worry is what will they do? Because I'm afraid I'll be looked at as a traitor or something, lol. I know its a bizarre thing to say, but yeah. I'm nervous, cause I go back tomorrow.

I used to be a licensed contractor but got out of the business for awhile. I am returning to the business as a handyman til I get going again.   I did work for someone who I felt was a friend. They live in an extravagant home. Mercedes, new truck....blah, blah...you get the point. I didn't think money was an issue.    So here's the deal. He wanted me to price this job, LABOR ONLY. He was going to provide all the power and materials. I just needed to show up. This was back in Nov I provided him with materials list. We are now in February and I am still trying to get his thing done because he is nickeling and diming this project to death.    Here's my main point. On numerous occasions I have driven to his house to meet him or work and either he isn't there, there's no material for what I need, or no power. This is estimated to be a 4 day job, yet because o frigid temps, no power, no material, I can't get this thing done. In the meantime I have spoken with him about just reimbursing me for my wasted time and now I can't get him to return my calls. So in a nutshell, I am out all this time and work and he has left me hanging. I cut him a good deal on this project because of our relationship and now I am getting boned. Boned to the point of losing my electricity and getting evicted from my apt. It's my problem, but do I have any recourse?    No contract either. Just pictures of the work, and pictures of me working on the job.   Thanks all.

20090219203424AAcUhO4	Politics & Government;Politics	How can you say you're patriotic and of supported the Bush Administration?	Bush's 8 years in office was a mixture of lies, scandals, and deceit. How could Bush supporters really say they're "patriotic."       Lets not just forget about some of these simple, but majorly important incidents, that if Obama had done, I could only imagine what Bush backers would say and think:      On 9/11, Bush sat reading a children's book in a classroom for 7 minutes after hearing the country was under attack. Instead of saying to the teacher " I have to get going, but it was nice ", he sat there with guilt and cowardice on his face.      Months after 9/11, a child asked what Bush's initial reaction was to the first plane hitting the twin towers on the day of 9/11. Bush said he was standing outside the classroom and had seen the plane hit the first tower on the tv, and thought it was just a bad pilot. Aside from the mingling and stuttering, he forgot that the footage on television didn't air until after the first tower was struck.      Bush's infamous, evil, comment about " those weapons of Mass destruction gotta be somewhere", with laughter echoing in front of him, at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2004, after 2800 troops at this point have already died.      Bush revealing the Identity of a true patriot, a CIA agent, who spent all her life tracking lose nukes for her country and the world, because her husband caught Bush and his henchmen on a lie about Iraq not really having WMD's.   Us still occupying Iraq, even learning right when the war began, that Iraq was actually no threat.      An economy collapsing, suspiciouslly right before Bush leaves office, and not doing anything about it or at least putting a plan forward that Obama could of continued off of. Bush watched our country crumble and did nothing whatsoever.      I'll tell you what. When Obama comes even remotely close to the scandals of the Bush Administration, the lies of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rove, Rice, or gives off a diabolical smirk as he talks about war, and serious matters, Then you can complain about Obama.

20090219203559AArN5la	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	If I got banned from a library, am I not allowed to even volunteer there?	If I got banned from a bar or a store, not only will I not allowed to be back there as a customer, but I will not be allowed to work there of course, right?      Now what about if it was a library? let's say I got banned from a library as a patron/customer for loitering and not reading (nothing major) but was banned for causing trouble doing nothing and being loud, am I even ever allowed to get a job there and be employed?      Am I allowed to volunteer at a library especially if I was banned there? Or is volunteering just as much of a privelage as being a staff member? This of course discluding MANDATORY COMMUNITY SERVICE AND JAILTIME WITH HAVING TO DO BATHROOMS AND STUFF AS A PUNISHMENT FOR GRAFITTI WITH HAVING TO GET ALOT OF HOURS IN FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE/VOLUNTEERING THAT ISNT PLEASANT but what about volunteering in general? Can I volunteer somewhere if I was banned or even fired from that place before?
