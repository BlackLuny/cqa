VLv3Vzjnaa	I don't believe any Southern State ever voted on civil rights for Black Americans.  If they had, the Black Americans would have lost.<br>  <br>  Gay people now, like Black people in the past, have learned to expect no justice from the courts.  When we do have the occasional victory, it's great.  But the fact of the matter is that the courts in the US have done a horrible job of protecting the civil rights of law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans.  <br>  <br>  If any other group, Black, Asians, Catholics, Mormons, the handicapped, women, Irish Americans, etc. had faced a ballot measure to prevent them from marrying, it would have been thrown out before it hit the ballot.  But gay Americans are forced to wage these battles over and over and over in a land that proclaims "all men are created equal."  That promise does not yet apply to us, but it will one day.<br>  <br>  It's sad how many justify their sin of homophobia by saying gay people have the same rights--the right to marry a member of the opposite sex.  But heterosexuality is unnatural for us.  Forcing is into an unnatural lifestyle is not a "right."  It's an excuse to allow unrepentant homophobes to feel all comfy and cozy about their discrimination toward other Americans.  What is next from those who promote the anti-gay agenda--separate bathrooms for gay and straight people?|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	A) This has nothing to do with religion or spirituality.<br>  <br>  B) You are confusing apples and oranges.  In the case of segregation some people were given a right others were not given. In the Prop 8 case all citizens of California have the exact same rights in regards to marriage. Nobody has the right to have a homosexual union recognized as a marriage.  If the State was saying Lesbian marriage was legal, but gay men being married was illegal you would have an excellent point, but since the law is applied uniformly it is not discriminatory on its face.  Just because you don't like it, that doesn't make it discrimination.<br>  <br>  C) Your history is wrong. Google Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).  After the southern states impose Jim Crow laws the Supreme Court of the United States UPHELD them, and they stayed in place for over 50 years.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	What has this to do with Religion. It is a secular problem. The slaves should have had rights all along. The right to vote, the right to education etc. You have all those rights except the right to marry, when I was growing up, someone who was gay was a happy go lucky person. Why not just except who you are? Homosexual, Lesbian etc.?|`|5bzJUmh4aa	That's true, but it took the courts nearly a hundred years after the Civil War to restore those lost rights.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Harvey, you know playing the race card for gay rights is not the way to go as it is a failed strategy? It needs to be played as a fairness and equality for all issue (while leaving the race issue unstated).<br>  <br>  I complete understand and feel your impatience with this issue. Remember how long it took you to enact voting by council districts in SF?|`|U2Tem402aa	there is a Major hole in that argument, Blacks were deprived of Normal rights because of Race, Homosexuals are granted the "EXACT" same rights as heterosexual people so my question is what rights are they being excluded "you say marriage" I say they can marry like every other person in this country you may say they don't get to marry who they Love, well most people don't marry who they love. your point is?|`|14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa	Maybe if only Southern states opposed it, but I think there may be more opposition....|`|b849wydSaa	Yeah. DAMN those activist judges. Always insisting on people having equal rights. What's up with that?|`|bmqJs2hwaa	ok.... i guess we are supposed to fill in the blanks|`|YA36FUf1aa	It seems to me that whichever group America collectively 'hates' changes over time. plenty of individual Americans are still extremely racist but it would appear that sadly, American society as a whole is still toxically opposed to homosexuality. The influence of an inherently homophobic and offensive religion in the USA is too great for the courts to ever do the decent thing and follow most sensible democracies by installing proper gay rights, allowing same-sex marriages and protecting LGBT people from the discrimination which is rife.<br>  <br>  Communists, black people, gay people...discrimination is one very tragic cycle.|`|AA11232725	Gays already have civil rights. In fact, they have some special rights since there are "hate crime" laws that make homosexuals a special class of protected people.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about "gay marriage" that's an attempt to pervert truth and once again give homosexuals special rights. They already have the same right to marry someone of the opposite sex, they just don't want to exercise that right for the most part. Instead they want special accommodation for their unnatural desires. Why doesn't the government allow people who have a desire to use illegal drugs make an accommodation for those type of people as well? Or why doesn't the government make allowances for polygamists or someone who wants to marry their dog like Hindus do in India?
hWvvrEphaa	In terms of Christianity, there are 2 types of people. People who call themselves Christians because they believe in God but have no idea what they're doing and live by the rules they see fit, and people who believe in God and seek to be more like Jesus.<br>  <br>  The first person is a weak christian (I use the word christian lightly). The second person is a born again christian. <br>  <br>  Although someone may claim to be a christian and believe in God, that does not  mean that they are a real christian. Satan uses weak believers to discourage unbelievers to become christians. He does this by telling that person that they are safe because they believe in God, but for those who don't they will burn in hell. Born again christians don't think like that. Before I became born again, I was telling people they were going to hell if they didn't repent and all sorts of weird stuff. Now, I would never say anything like that. Unbelievers are people who were just like me and I have no right to judge them. In the bible Jesus warned us "beware of wolves in sheeps clothing" meaning there will be people who will pretend to me christians (wolves - not christian), but are in fact not christians at all (sheep - christian)<br>  <br>  As a christian I am attacked on a daily basis by non-christians and christians too.. Be it a rude comment about my intelligence for refusing to believe in such 'nonsense', or about my truly 'pathetic' answers I give to christian questions. Since I became a christian I have been mocked, laughed at, degraded, not taken seriously, I have lost most of my friends, been called mentally ill...you name it. Guess what? I would still never give up what I have (relationship with Jesus). Would you like to know what really hurts me? Seeing people call themselves Christians and acting like savages. The amount of times I see the world hell used in the run of a day makes me sick. No one in this whole universe can tell you where you're going when you die and although I believe in God with all my heart, I don't know what happens after death. Nobody does. <br>  <br>  <br>  Excellent Question Girl.<br>  <br>  God bless you.|`|Gsd4VD13aa	Honestly, its because thats what Christianity encourages. Its quite sad. Not to mention incredibly aggravating and annoying.|`|AA10641825	I get comments about my character and intelligence.  So far none of the comments have been flattering.<br>  But I wouldn't say it amounts to outright hatred.  <br>  <br>  I do wish church folks would just answer the question, and leave me out of it.<br>  .|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	Hannah i'm sorry you have had this experience of some Christians.<br>  I haven't actually come across hatred or venom from Christians here.<br>  Try to remember  we all have our faults, and try not to judge until you have met a lot of people.<br>  I can assure you there is a lot of love here too.<br>  <br>  Anyway i hope you will stay around and meet some lovely people here - Christians and other faith believers.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Born again Christian in the process of change    ; )<br>  ~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Actually i'd like to add: i have seen some bad attitude from some Christians - sorry i just remembered after i posted my answer -  but hatred or venom, i wouldn't go that far.<br>  Do you think it's right  to judge all Christians by a few ?. . . <br>  T xx|`|pakIAYWoaa	Jesus gave the parable of wheat and tares growing up together; there are many warning,, admonshments, and prophecies regaurding evil integrating into the church.  So this phenomonon is actually to be expected especially in the last days where it says the love of many will grow cold as false teachers and false christs proliferate.  Also I feel many cast their pearls before swine and get frustrated and then answer a fool according to his folly and are becoming like them...|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Tell me about it.<br>  <br>  The venom I see on here from christians has made me no longer afraid to say I hold their cult indoctrination to be the absolute LOWEST form of human psychology.<br>  <br>  But wait! Don't be sad! Be glad you are smarter than that!|`|yzRHAWNhaa	Just what are your standards for a person to be a Christian? Do you know what a real Christian is? Or do you Judge Christians based on your concept of what you think a Christian should be?|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	I havent personally been attacked by the Christians and I'm surprised because I left the church and refer to my ex followers as brainwashed (maybe I could find a less offensive word one day)<br>  <br>  I do read uneducated questions and answers from them. I don't mind faith as being an answer (with some explanation) but what saddens me is anyone pushing their beliefs on each other - I have thoroughly enjoyed the banter that goes on here...if it wasn't for YA, I would have been an ignorant person (yes I admit I'm still learning)<br>  <br>  Now your question is a little biased - I've seen some counter arguments from atheists that seem a little harsh and derogatory ....both sides are pushing their points...both should respect freedom from religion and freedom for religion but at the same time both should respect the right for each to debate their beliefs|`|V8TFzhYZaa	Bewildering, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Folk pretending to follow the "Prince of Peace" and prophet of Love seem to be the most vehemently hateful and judgemental group around.<br>  <br>  I posted a question that contained a very old joke about requiring a disclaimer on bibles and the christ-worshippers went absolutely insane!<br>  <br>  One tried to be sarcastic by calling me a "genius," even though my Stanford Binet score is twenty points higher than A. Einstien's score on the same battery of tests (technically making me a supergenius).<br>  <br>  Another suggested that I try studying the bible - when I have degrees from three different theological seminaries and the answerer is "self taught."<br>  <br>  Yet another came right out and called me "schmucko."<br>  <br>  Although their names aren't important, I will say that I blocked them all and can only hope that they have the grace to return the favor!|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	Don't be put off and don't be saddened.  I've only been on Y!A for a few months, but I see hatred and venom in every category.. I've even seen it posted in other sections that they come into this section just to stir up trouble.  A true christian is above this sort of thing, so please keep that in mind when you read posters comments.  Look at their bio and their questions and see if they measure up to your standards before you believe a word of what they have posted.  : )|`|cpOtr6Thaa	I can't and won't make excuses for Christians that behave badly and it saddens me as well.  I try not to be one of them.  <br>  <br>  Here is my theory, though.  <br>  <br>  1. People get brave in an anonymous setting such as this.  <br>  <br>  2. Even though it seems like Christians are the majority, we are still attacked in a big way.  My perception is that there are more insults flung at us than the other way around (I could be wrong).  <br>  <br>  3. We hurt just like anyone else and we're not perfect.  <br>  <br>  4. The world seems to hold us to a higher standard.  Some of Christianity's attackers claim that since atrocities were done in the name of religion hundreds of years ago, it's time something was said.  There are extreme Christian groups around today that say and do things I would never do.  So even though I personally didn't commit a crime on behalf of religion or subscribe to that particular branch of Christianity, I still have to take the heat.|`|OLHiZ045aa	Personal attacks are the fall-back position of the unintelligent and uneducated.|`|AA12045802	They are not Christians,they have been fed a lie and they believed it, Christians would not act like they do.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	It's even better when they do it to your face, on your own front porch.|`|f7JIqk5Raa	It's true there are some that are so passionate about their belief, that in the excitment of trying to show others, they forget what that belief is all about. Or perhaps, they are just looking for an excuse to argue over something. Whatever the case, we just have to remember that no person is perfect nor does their views and attempts to get those views across reflect the people of that religion as a whole. I'm a christian, and would love to speak to others about Christ bc he's transformed my life so much. But as much as I or any believer wants to share that, it can't be forced onto anyone. I'm sorry this happened, and I hope that there are at least a few answers to these questions that will help rather than hurt. Don't give up searching for what you're looking for :) Good luck|`|tedOdb7jaa	im a christian and i dont answer rudely. what are you talking about anyway?

Along with that there were other devils and evil as well. The serpent told Eve to eat, and not Lucifer. Although the serpent is a form of evil, and might have been one of the devils.<br>  <br>  Now to your question: God would not allow sinners in the garden, but just because God knows you're going to sin one day, doesn't mean you can't be in the garden if you haven't sinned yet. There were many animals in the garden, and there was no sin yet. But once man fell, they were kicked out.<br>  <br>  Now why would God let the serpent in? Well although God did know again it doesn't mean he will punish you before doing the act. Same logic, why did God create Adam and Eve, if he knew they were going to sin. Why did Jesus choose Judas as on of the disciples, if he knew he was going to turn him in?<br>  <br>  God's knowledge doesn't mean that he won't give people the chance.

AA10601065	Sweetheart, all of us have been through the same situation at some point in our lives, but love doesn't just happen. You don't wake up one morning and suddenly there it is. Unfortunately, being under 18 doesn't help because it limits your ability to go out and meet other gay people. Sure, college will open up a lot of possibilities for you. The college you go to might even have some sort of LGBT club or group that you could join. But love isn't just going to fall in your lap. You have to meet somebody first. Then, if you like each other, you form a friendship. And after that, if you're lucky, the two of you might fall in love. Love isn't just going to be handed to you; you have to work at it. And when it happens, it's a two-way street--you and your mate both have to work equally as hard at making the relationship last.<br>  <br>  You're young. Be patient. It's when you least expect it, when you're not looking for it, that something extraordinary happens.<br>  <br>  And everybody should get a hug at least once a day, so here's a hug from me:<br>  <br>  *****BIG HUG*****<br>  <br>  ADDITION:<br>  Also, please don't be sad about other people's relationships.

I'm in the same situation, and I spend most of my time reminding myself that I will find someone, you just gotta tell yourself the same thing.

AA10034051	Marriage is not an invention of man. God instituted marriage. According to God's plan, man and woman together form the unit of humanity. A man or a woman alone is only part of an entirety. <br>  <br>  <br>  "And the Lord God said, 'It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him'" (Gen. 2:18).<br>  "Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. And Adam said:<br>  <br>  'This is now bone of my bone<br>  And flesh of my flesh; <br>  She shall be called Woman, <br>  Because she was taken out of Man.' <br>  <br>  Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Gen. 2:22-24)<br>  Adam received his wife as a gift from God. In a sense it is still true that a man receives his wife from God. Solomon says: <br>  <br>  <br>  "Houses and riches are an inheritance from fathers, <br>  But a prudent wife is from the Lord" (Proverbs 19:14). <br>  We also see that marriage is good. Solomon says in another place: <br>  <br>  <br>  "He who finds a wife finds a good thing,<br>  And obtains favour from the Lord" (Proverbs 18:22). <br>  We also see how strong the marriage bond is, so strong that they are no longer two but are melted together as one flesh. <br>  <br>  This bond is so strong that it is broken only by death. As long as they live they are one together. They may not separate. Jesus quoted this passage when He was asked about marriage:<br>  <br>  <br>  "The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, 'Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?' And He answered and said to them, 'Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning "made them male and female," and said, "For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh"? So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.' They said to Him, 'Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?' He said to them, 'Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery'" (Mat. 19:3-9). <br>  <br>  In this passage in Genesis we also see how dependent man and woman are on each other. They need each other. Paul says:<br>  <br>  <br>  "Nevertheless, neither is man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Lord. For as the woman was from the man, even so the man also is through the woman; but all things are from God" (1 Cor. 11:11,12). <br>  Marriage is an institution of God and is a continuation of His work of creation. Sexual desires are God-given. We should view our manliness or womanliness as a gift from God which we receive with thankfulness and strive to keep holy and pure in accordance with His instructions. <br>  <br>  Matrimony: The Sacrament of Matrimony is the Sacrament which unites a man and woman in lawful marriage.<br>  Biblical references: Matt 19:5; Mark 10:7-12; Eph 5:22-32; 1 Thess 4:4; Mal 2:14-16;<br>  Matt 5:32-33; Matt 19:4-6,9; Mark 10:11-12; Lk 16:18; Rom 7:2-3; 1 Cor 7:10-11|`|AA11245447	It's become both.  In order to be legally defined as married and have all the rights and benefits of the state/fed, you must be registered and married civilly (at the very least).

Always has been a government/cultural thing, not always religious.  Early Christians preached AGAINST marriage because Jesus was coming back at any moment.  He didn't.  And, like Paul, Christians reluctantly decided G-d would insist on marriage if you absolutely had to get married instead of being celibate (Jews never had a problem with sex, celibacy is a strange and foreign concept in Judaism).<br>  <br>  You can get married without ever having anything to do with religion but you can't get divorced without involving the state, whether your marriage was conducted inside or outside a religion = government.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	A state institution, which is why married couples get 1,324 rights granted by the government that unmarried couples do not.|`|6Er6DPTdaa	Most people say both.

Also, it is used for any idea, thought, dogma, principle or lifestyle that is in conflict with the Orthodox Faith. In general, this term is used in two distinct cases: 1. Whenever Eastern Orthodoxy wants to classify something different, but not as different or thought to be as erroneous as heresy; 2. Whenever Eastern Orthodoxy wants, for any reason, to abstain from the use of the word heresy.<br>  <br>  The term heterodox is occasionally used by some Christians to refer to themselves when they are in disagreement with orthodox understandings, but voice this disagreement while still maintaining the overall value of the tradition. The heterodox Christian therefore remains in the tradition and attempts to stimulate constructive dialog around issues with which they disagree.
wB3AbJyLaa	Hell isn't a torture chamber. Hell is about relationships, broken relationships. In the Bible, hell is separation or banishment from the most beautiful being in the world, God himself. It's exclusion not only from God but also from those who have come to know and love him. Hell is a punishment for having broken God's standards and is a natural consequence of choosing to be separate from God. Hell is a punishment, but not punishing. The punishment of hell is separation from God and the shame, anguish, and regret that go along with it. The pain may be both mental and physical, but it will be the pain and sorrow of final, eternal banishment from God and the good life for which we were created. Hell is the final sentence that says you refuse regularly to live in relationship with God, and the inevitable result of that choice is to be sent away from God for all eternity. So it is punishment. But it's also the natural consequence of a life that has been lived in a certain direction. I believe that the imagery of flames the Bible uses to describe hell is a figure of speech. Trying to take flames of hell literally results in nonsense. For example, hell is described as a place of utter darkness. How can that be? Flames would light things up. Here's a similar example: The Bible says that, at his return, Christ will come surrounded by flames and with a big sword coming out of his mouth. Will he be unable to speak because he's choking on a sword? Few people consider that to be a literal sword. Instead, the sword in that passage of the Scripture is an image that stands for the word of God. The flames stand for Christ coming judgment. Another example: In Hebrews 12:29, God is called a consuming fire. Yet nobody thinks God is a cosmic Bunsen burner. Using the flame imagery is a way of saying he's a God of judgment. The Bible also talks about hell being a place where worms constantly eat people's flesh. In Jesus' day, thousands of animals were sacrificed ever week in the Temple, and there was a sewage system for the blood and fat outside, where it gathered in a pool. There would have been worms and maggots constantly feeding on that waste. It must have been a very ugly, and smelly, place. When Jesus was teaching, he used this metaphor as a way of saying hell is worse than that disgusting place outside the city, a place all of his listeners would have known about. Gnashing of teeth is an expression of rage at realizing you've just made a huge mistake. When you hear about people gritting their teeth today, it means they're angry or frustrated, not that they are being tortured. If you've ever been around people who are really self-centered, know they get angry when they don't get their way. I believe the gnashing of teeth mentioned in Scripture is expression of the personality of the type of people who will end up in hell. I'm sure your friends are as kind as you are. The Bible teaches that there are different degrees of suffering in hell. One passage you can read about that is Matthew 11:20-24. Jesus says people will be sentenced according to how they lived. There will be degrees of separation, isolation, and emptiness in hell. God's justice is proportional. There is not exactly the same experience for everyone.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  That's a good question, and all I can say is, you are making a common mistake, and using the wrong model here.<br>  <br>  Most people, as you are here, think of Jesus as a judge who orders people to be sent to Hell, like a Judge imposing a sentence in a court.<br>  <br>  That's totally the wrong way to look at this.<br>  <br>  First of all, Jesus doesn't "send" anyone to Hell. Hell is our "default destination".  EVERYONE sins, EVERYONE is a sinner, EVERYONE goes to Hell...unless they are saved. Kind people are dammed, polite people are dammed, mean people are dammed. Hell isn't just for "bad people" it's for EVERYBODY because, push come to shove, we are ALL bad people when you get right down to it.<br>  <br>  The better way to look at it is think of yourself on a ship that is rapidly sinking. Unless you get into a lifeboat PDQ, you are going into the water...where you will drown (or freeze, or be eaten by sharks...there are lots of ways to die in a shipwreck so take you pick).  Jesus is showing us the way to the lifeboat deck. Jesus is like the crewmen telling us "Get into the lifeboat and you will be saved, stay on this ship and you will die". <br>  <br>  Well, if the crew is telling you to get into the boat, and there are boats available, and you ignore the crew and choose to stay on the sinking ship...well it's not the crew's fault if you wind up on the bottom of the ocean come breakfast time.<br>  <br>  Now you ask about people who may not have been exposed to the Gospel for one reason or another, what happens to them?  Well to continue the analogy, if they are on the ship, and they notice that water is coming in, and they head up to the boat deck and get in a boat, without having been told to do so by the crew, they will be saved along with the rest of the passengers. Similarly, if they do their level best to seek out God in their lives and do His will, and if they are genuinely seeking Jesus,  Jesus won't hide from them (even though they may call Him by the wrong name).  I think they will find Jesus...even if they call Him Apollo or Thor or something. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|QpUhZHj7aa	You've hit upon the basic problem with christianity.

It has only been around since the 1970's and has already gone through essentially 6 revisions already.  The source materials for D&D are much more in depth and authoritative than the Bible, yet lots of people are still confused by it.  <br>  <br>  So it really isn't strange that people find the Bible confusing.  It's been through many versions, and is based on source materials many times removed from the events being described.  There is just bound to be a lot of people who play D&D instead of reading the Bible.  It is more fun after all.<br>  <br>  Now those new fangled computer online role playing games, that's just outright heresy by some people's thinking.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Religion is a complicated phenomenon, whether you are a believer or not.<br>  <br>  Yes, the basic principals are usually simple, but there is a lot of complex philosophy involved as well. <br>  It is not as simple as it looks.|`|IGu4bx51aa	I think you are referring to what I term "The Long Frock Brigade" who like to buy everything that's free<br>  Yes we can work it out for ourselves and this lot really do have a great deal to answer for I haven't a good word to say about any of them <br>  They are directly responsible for causing Fear Division Misunderstandings Mistrust War Death Lost Opportunity There is a very lengthy list <br>  Yes lead a good life and if the God wishes to speak to you He/She is more than able to speak directly Without these fools and their collection/begging bowls <br>  I better stop now before the account goes west <br>  Good luck with it|`|AA11930957	religion was _Invented_ by sjamans who liked to impress people with their "powers".<br>  so they started telling them that there is a god (godS)<br>  and they would be punished (e.g. by lightning) if they didn't believe him.|`|SZvJVM2yaa	yes no doubt|`|nIu8zVkXaa	As a Christian I like you am appalled at those claiming to be Christians such as Benny Hinn and others.  There is nothing in scripture that promotes such side shows as what he does and it's all for the money.  Christianity is not difficult at all to understand.  It is when one lets all those "religious" rituals take hold that it becomes complicated.  Here is a clue for you.   If you see or hear something that isn't in the scriptures, then it ain't real or the truth.  It's a lie or a trick.  By the way, remember that according to scripture, Satan will disguise himself as an angel of light.  In other words he will imitate that which he hates the most to deceive people.
788d7c7ce9ee2dd89f47d95303ca9817aa	Religion was created to explain the unexplainable.

His initial conversion was like this, and it is not that uncommon -- And he was a damn smart guy !!<br>  <br>  "You must picture me alone in that room at Magdalen, night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England" (Surprised By Joy,  ch. 14, p. 266).<br>  <br>  ====> The most dejected, reluctant convert in all England|`|de2AwHpHaa	some have to have that peace of mind.  religion probably came about because early humans didn't have science to explain the world to them.|`|eLbrMleWaa	We need god because we need an explanation for the unexplainable.<br>  Like "Why did she have to die?" answer:  "oh because it was god's will"<br>  <br>  <br>  As humans we want to know everything and when we don't, we make stuff up...|`|nIu8zVkXaa	This is actually a funny question but I'll try to answer anyway.  Religions are just man's traditions.  Jesus hated religion.  Christianity or Judaism is not a religion if practiced according to the scriptures.  They are a way of life.  As for why is there a need for God, the question is absurd because in the phrasing of the question, you place yourself above God and reduce Him to something or someone who fills a need for you or others.  God is sovereign.  He is the Creator of all there is including you.  He is Holy, Just, and Righteous.  We need Him, He doesn't need us.  He loves us and created us because just like your parents, He wanted children that love Him.  We should love Him because He is Our Father and Our Creator.  Our life comes from Him.  His life does not come from our need for Him like some fairy tale fable that makes you feel good sometimes.  If man ever learns to understand the nature of God Our Father, we will be a different creature than we are now but man is content to be his own god for now.  Aren't we doing a great job being our own god?|`|t88527U1aa	We are hard wired for belief according to some Mri and Pet scan studies.

EJHhCDcaaa	conundrum-  Here is your quotes!<br>  <br>  Do not conclude that there are different roads, or ways, that you can follow to gain life in God's new system. There is only one. There was just one ark that survived the Flood, not a number of boats. And there will be only one organization—God's visible organization — that will survive the fast-approaching "great tribulation." It is simply not true that all religions lead to the same goal...

It is a promise given by Jehovah God as shown to us in his word the Bible.<br>  <br>  In order to avoid misunderstandings, Jehovah’s Witnesses try to be careful about how they express themselves. Instead of saying, “the Society teaches,” many Witnesses prefer to use such expressions as, “the Bible says” or, “I understand the Bible to teach.” In this way they emphasize the personal decision that each Witness has made in accepting Bible teachings and also avoid giving the false impression that Witnesses are somehow bound to the dictates of some religious sect. Of course, suggestions as regards terminology should never become a subject of controversy. After all, terminology is of importance only to the extent that it prevents misunderstandings. Christian balance is required. The Bible admonishes us “not to fight about words.” (2?Timothy 2:14, 15) The Scriptures also state this principle: “Unless you through the tongue utter speech easily understood, how will it be known what is being spoken?”—1?Corinthians 14:9.|`|hj76FSKdaa	Eternal life comes through a personal relationship with Jesus, not membership in a particular religion.

Was this promise kept? Of course not.  Neither were any of the other promises the Watchtower made before or since then.  Keeping a promise means being true to ones word.

zjzfWaGXaa	hahaha, and guys complain about being in the friend zone. Welcome to the other side darling. <br>  <br>  Congratulations for time spent and lack of services rendered you have officially been awarded...a penis. That's right, one big thick dangling hunk of man meat that every guy you know can see bulging through your mini-skirt. You are officially persona non-pussy in the eyes of every man you know. You could look like the love child of Megan Fox and Posh Spice with cherry flavored nipples and it wouldn't matter anymore. <br>  <br>  The only way to get a penectomy now is to shock them with your sexuality. This can be accomplished by one simple slutty degrading act done in front of them. Could be making out with a girl, could be grabbing a guys junk take your pick.<br>  <br>  Disclaimer: (it could also be one of two other things, your not hot like you said you were or your an arrogant ***** both of which would turn guys off nothing is worse than a girl (anyone really) who thinks they are top dog.

8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	Matt. 27:46 and Mark 15:34, Jesus is speaking his native tongue, Aramaic. He was quoting Psalm 22, declaring that He is the Christ, the Messiah.  Translated, it says, "My God, my God, why has thoforsaken me?"  It is a rhetorical question because if you read the whole Psalm, there is no forsaking going on. Jesus could not quote the Psalm in its entirety because He was dying, so there is no reason for it to bother you.<br>  Please read the whole Psalm 22 and see what Jesus was really trying to say.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	It is not recorded in all the gospels because the Holy Spirit did not deem it necessary or it would have been in there.  However, when Jesus said the above, He was not literally saying that God had abandoned Him.  Most of those who witnessed his crucifixion were Jews.  When He said the above statement, He was quoting Psalm 22 which is a prophetic Psalm concerning the Messiah.  Every Jew would have known exactly what He was referring to the moment they heard Him quote it particularly those of the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees who wanted Him dead.  In the last moments of His life, He gave what in our courts would be a death bed confession, that He was and is the Messiah.|`|ouXrNitMaa	I was taught that it was to emphasize not only the physical pain, but also the emotional pain Jesus endured for daring to challenge the "authority" of those who claimed to speak for their god.|`|oVHFz52Laa	The first time ever He had sin on His shoulders and He did not feel the presence of god.

I believe he is reaching out to them even in his dying breath and showing us what we need to do.<br>  <br>  The question of why was Christ crucified is integral to our identity as Christians and one that must be considered and evaluated.|`|yDgxAHO9aa	You're right this does throw off a lot of people, so let me try to explain what this means.<br>  <br>  You know this means 'father why did you leave me', although we know the father is the son is the holy spirit, and they never separated, so why would he say that?<br>  <br>  Quick example: a young child, about 5 years old, is in the hospital about to get a huge operation. The child's father is holding his hand, but the doctors are coming to take away the kid. The kid is terrified, so while the doctors are coming, and the kid is holding his father's hand, he is screaming to him 'daaad, daad, don't leave me, please don't leave me', although his dad is right there, and is holding his hand.<br>  <br>  Same idea, the father never left the son (Jesus is God), Jesus was in the flesh, and was weakened which lead to this saying for the reasons I explained.<br>  <br>  Now I'm not sure about this not being in all the Gospels, but this is true of so many other things. It is in only one Gospel that Jesus forgave the thief on the cross, doesn't mean it did happen though.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	He spoke in an unknown tongue.

VRl1jENHaa	Paperback clearly has not researched this matter AT ALL.  Here are the REAL facts:<br>  <br>  1)  It is true that, while the pagan mosque stands on Mt. Moriah, the Third Temple cannot be built.  Currently, it is believed that the destruction of the mosque would be a sign from God that the Temple should be rebuilt.<br>  <br>  2)  HOWEVER, as a show of faith, in the meantime, many of the Jews in Israel have done the following:  researched the exact location on the Mount where the Temple should be placed, in the event the mosque is (*ahem*) no longer an impediment; made -- to exacting detail -- the implements needed to perform the various Temple rituals; made the various garments needed by the Levites and Priests; set up a rigourous training program for the Priests; identified valid Priests and disqualified invalid (or improperly documented) men from the Priestly class; they have even identified the cornerstone for the Temple, which was miraculously found to be a perfect stone, that had not been cut with metal implements (which would have rendered it disqualified).  Each year, the stone is paraded around the Temple Mount.<br>  <br>  You can read details about these things (and more) at the following sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.templeinstitute.org/main.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.templeinstitute.org/main.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.templemountfaithful.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.templemountfaithful.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.templemount.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.templemount.org/</a>|`|8I9uduIiaa	Not true at all.<br>  <br>  Judaism says and has always said that the temple will only be rebuilt when the Jewish maschiach comes - and ushers in world peace.<br>  <br>  Clearly that is not happening.<br>  <br>  Also, there is a rather big Mosque that got placed slapbang on the spot where the temple used to stand.|`|Api5zLaeaa	SHHHH!!!

If you truly love the sinner, you will accept him/her regardless of that individual's characteristics or behavior. Read that parable in Matthew 7 about the complaining about your neighbor's splinter while ignoring the timber you have in your eye.<br>  <br>  I HATE SIN: No, if you want someone to change you really hate the sinner. Homosexuality between consenting adults is a victimless activity that has no bearing on you. Love is unconditional.<br>  <br>  I DISAGREE WITH THEIR CHOSEN LIFESTYLE: First, being gay is not a lifestyle and it isn’t chosen. No, you really hate them and want them to conform to your world view.<br>  <br>  HOMOSEXUALITY IS A SIN: No it is not. Jesus never spoke to the concept of sexual orientation or homosexuality. As Christians like to remind atheists, Jesus came to replace the old testament laws with a new covenant. Since he threw out all those laws in Leviticus regarding the consumption of shrimp and wearing cotton-poly blends, he also did away with that little bit about man lying with man (which was a mistranslation to being with).<br>  <br>  JUST BECAUSE I DON’T AGREE WITH THEIR SIN DOESN’T MAKE ME A HATER: No one is calling you a hater because gay sex is just not your cup of tea. When you legislate against victimless yet loving activities that you don’t like, that makes you a hater. As long as an individual is not causing you or anyone else harm, live and let live without judgment.<br>  ----------<br>  True LOVE accepts every individual as is. Love is UNCONDITIONAL.<br>  <br>  As Auntie Mame says, "Darling, I disapprove of absolutely nothing."|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	God's side<br>  <br>  God says<br>  Rom 1:26  For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: <br>  Rom 1:27  And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. <br>  Rom 1:28  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	Think about it this way--is the little six year old girl who has a "crush" on her friend in kindergarten sinning?<br>  <br>  What about the first grade boy who rather than poking the girls he "likes" pokes the boys he "likes"<br>  <br>  It isn't like gay people sit down one day and say "Hmm, I think I'll be gay today, just to make my parents hate me, or so I can get beat up in school."<br>  <br>  And for those saying that just the "act" or the "sex" is a sin, I will tell you to read your Bible a little closer. Jesus says to even think of a sin, such as adultery or murder, is still a sin, so even just thinking about homosexuality, by your book, is a sin.<br>  <br>  And you know, some homosexuals find the idea of straight sex gross. Frankly the thought of it is rather repulsive.|`|jkW2b55Qaa	As a non-book worshiper, I don't know why you would believe in sin, or why you would believe sex is a source of shame or, as you put it, gross(ness).|`|OugNf0x6aa	Gay is OK!

Just my view.|`|1fyZTtnVaa	It's not a sin. If you read the verse Leviticus chapter 18 verse 22 it says<br>  <br>  "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable."<br>  <br>  From this verse, most people believe that it is a sin to be homosexual. But the problem with this is, where in this verse does it say that it is a sin to BE homosexual? The verse speaks of the action that is the sin.<br>  <br>  The way I see it, is there is nothing different than sex before marriage or two men or two women having it. Sex outside of marriage is the sin, no matter how you have it. It is all adultery, no one is worse than the other.<br>  <br>  To take this even further, I saw a reference to 1 Corinthians 6:9. Let's have a look.<br>  <br>  "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders"<br>  <br>  Again, this verse is speaking of the actions.|`|41745c09d2ff54e29f907b66a19d4c31aa	This is a great question of our day. How are Christians supposed to respond to the homosexual lifestyle? First, we are called specifically to love people--regardless of their lifestyles. The Bible does teach, however, that homosexuality is a sin (1 Cor. 6.9), because it denies the natural order instituted by God in creation. It is not our place to judge, but to love. Check out the website in my sources for a testimony from Christopher Yuan (a former homosexual).|`|KscqCNmCaa	It isn't a sin.<br>  The bible has a line about man lying with man being an abomination.<br>  A couple more lines further down the page it says disobedient children should be stoned to death. <br>  People cherry pick what rules they want to follow.<br>  The bronze age goat herders who wrote this mumbo jumbo just wanted their followers to propagate So they could increase their power and influence. Any sexual pleasure outside of that end was frowned upon.|`|19JkC34Xaa	There are 6 or so lines, I think, in the bible about homosexuality being a sin. Being gay isn't a choice, people are born that way so it's all completely unfair.

Secondly, there is hope for Christians who struggle with same-sex attractions.<br>  <br>  "Like all temptations, passions and sins, including those deeply, and oftentimes seemingly indelibly embedded in our nature by our sorrowful inheritance, homosexual orientation can be cured and homosexual actions can cease. With God all things are possible." (<a href="http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/ethics/hopko_homosexual_christian.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org...</a><br>  <br>  Christians ought to encourage and help other Christians avoid this lifestyle. For those who are not Christians, we ought also to love and share the message that Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay the penalty for their sins regardless of what they are! Yes, homosexual behavior is a sin--but so are hatred and anger.<br>  <br>  As for fairness, God says "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion" (Exod 33.19; and so Romans 9.18 "Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden") to which some respond "Then, why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?" (Rom. 9.19) And the best answer is given by Scripture: "But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'" (Rom. 9.20).|`|cvp8ISHLaa	wow...im reading these answers and its like a scary movie where everyone in the town acts the same way and anyone they come across that is different is disemboweled...anyways back on the subject they think its a sin cause a king back in the day wrote that in the bible along with a whole bunch of other silly crap and forced his subjects to worship it...then it turns out the king was gay...wierd...|`|iu2hnHp7aa	Because people don't like people who are different than them.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	If you bother to actually read the Bible, which admittedly very few Christians do, it's a sin for a man to engage in homosexual acts not to simply be homosexual.  No one can control his subconscious, so it's our actions that count.  As to the fairness of it, if you are a Christian you should believe that "fair" is whatever God says it is, "God said it, I believe it, that settles it", in which case there would be only one side on which you could be, His.  The real question would be what do your heart and conscience tell you?  That is where the God(s) of our understanding speaks to us all, and that is what should decide what you do, even if means going against the established Church.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	it's when a man sticks his penis into another man's anus.<br>  <br>  <br>  Regardless of rather it is "right" or "wrong", one thing we (should) all be able to agree on about that is, it is not normal or healthy.

People use a handful of misinterpreted/mistranslated verses to justify homophobia.<br>  <br>  Homophobia is a sin like lying, stealing and murder.

X3QbcIUwaa	It's a real pity to see how many people took your question as an opportunity to show their hate and ignorance, when they could philosophise matters and have a proper conversation/debate.<br>  <br>  My answer would be this:anyone that has accepted the Holy Trinity as their saviour and practices love for everyone no matter what.<br>  <br>  I am a Christian and what this means to me personally is that I try to do as much good as I can. I try to love everyone no matter what they believe in or where they come from. This means that I respect everyone, want the best for them and try to be as helpful as possible.<br>  <br>  I really don't care if people are different (ie homosexuals, muslim, atheist...) I love them all. The differences teach us so much and I try to be a better person to all my brothers and sisters around the world.<br>  <br>  I read science books and love them, I disagree with fanatics. I basically just try to be the best I can be.

We are all His children.|`|jr926Unvaa	There are "unreal Christians", but they are not necessarily the ones commonly called "unreal Christians".  A simple definition would be those who cloak themselves in claims of Christianity only to deceive others.  Without admission or manifest behaviour, such a person would be hard for us to identify.<br>  <br>  What is a "real" Christian?<br>  <br>  We obviously have our modern definitions, many of which are needlessly elitist and possibly incorrect.<br>  <br>  It's common to grab onto ideas of "orthodoxy" or "purism" and exclude others as heretical or impure.  It happens in every religious, political, and thought movement.  To objective students of history, such an approach may in fact be justified at times, since there are certainly occasions of embittered, willful rejection of established authorities with intent to defraud followers or promote one's own status.  But perhaps far more often, claiming orthodoxy is not historically supported; it's just easier to assume we're the original ones, especially if we have large numbers on our side or are surrounded by agreement.<br>  <br>  If we're careful with history, we can more fully understand that our belief systems, too, have passed through periods of "heresy", and while we will of course still be free to make value judgements, we will stop using current popularity as a measurement of the originality or authenticity of doctrine.<br>  <br>  Among others, one working definition of "real" Christians is people whose beliefs and culture match those of the earliest followers of Christ.  None of us in Western countries retain the culture, and deciding which churches most nearly equal the doctrine of primitive Christianity requires corroboration with the ancient sources.<br>  <br>  For example, Trinitarianism, as most historians will readily admit, was not the original Christian interpretation of God and had to be explicitly codified centuries after Christ, and competing interpretations quashed.  The popular side won out.  Without making a judgement here on its correctness, it was clearly a developed rather than a foundational doctrine.|`|Kl56NSmLaa	A "real" Christian is someone who agrees with me of course!

They continue to willfully sin, then get offended when someone catches them at it.   They may believe, but they do not behave.    These are considered to be false Christians.    <br>  <br>  People who teach false teachings while claiming to be Christian are considered false teachers, which the Bible already warned us about.  We compare the teachings of others to what we know to be the true message of the Bible.  If the teachings are contrary to what is written, those teachers are to be discounted. <br>  <br>  Some folks forget that what Christians are supposed to do is share the Good News that Christ brought to the Earth -- That of forgiveness and remission of sin.   We are not here to judge, or to condemn.   We are supposed to look out for our fellow Christians, though, and when we see them in a state of sin, we are supposed to gently remind them of their promise to God, and help them regain their path.    <br>  <br>  To the "unchurched", we just share.   If folks have questions, we can outline what kind of things God might consider sinful, and how to attain the gift of Grace, which removes the sin from our record.|`|oVHFz52Laa	Real Christian has true Jesus and believes the bible is true.

gHUHcPFwaa	You are not required to wear cover as a Muslim woman considering you are not a Muslim woman. There are different ideas of how much cover is enough and how much is too much. I would say be modest. Honestly I have studied about this and what I have found is that there are certain rules a Muslim woman has to follow when covering. First covering is not just the hair it is your body. Do not wear tight fitting clothes. Don't wear low cut shirts or items that show your limbs. You do not have to wear all black in fact most muslim women rarely wear all black. You can find many beautiful Muslim clothes that are modest and very pretty. There is no need by Islam to cover your face, your hands or wear all Black.<br>  <br>  If you would like more help you can write an email to me and I will help you with any questions you have. ;)<br>  <br>  Laila_Habibti@yahoo.com|`|6KGGAtNtaa	There are different schools of thought on the Hijab(Headscarf) and covering that a Muslim woman wear.

cpOtr6Thaa	Question 1: If the 1st person has NOT accepted Jesus when they give their heart as a transplant to the 2nd person, they are NOT going to heaven (good deeds, unfortunately, don't save us).  <br>  <br>  Question 2: If the 1st person already knew they'd be visiting the  pastor the next day and would be saved, then THEY'RE ALREADY SAVED because all it takes is a change of mind/heart to be saved, not a visit with a pastor.  If he has accepted Jesus but chooses not to help person #2 with a transplant, person #1 is STILL GOING TO HEAVEN.  Their destination has nothing to do with person #2 being good or bad.<br>  <br>  Question 3: Since we established in qu.#2 that the 1st person is SAVED, then if they exchange their life for person #2, they are GOING TO HEAVEN.  And no, person #1's destiny is not dependent on the good-ness of person #2.<br>  <br>  Question 4: If the 1st person did not know Jesus when they gave up their life for person #2, they will NOT go to heaven.  As I said earlier, good deeds do NOT save you.  <br>  <br>  Question 5: If the 1st person knew that #2 person would be saved the next day and sacrificed themselves for person #2, they would NOT go to heaven if they have not yet accepted Christ.  But since person #1 felt it was important to sacrifice their life so person #2 could know about God, then I'd wonder if person #1 already knew God.  If that is the case, then person #1 is possibly saved.    <br>  <br>  I'd like to summarize in order to simplify and help you understand.  <br>  <br>  1. If you have accepted Christ in your life, you are going to heaven.  It doesn't require a pastor, only a change of mind and heart.  God knows.  <br>  <br>  2. No amount of good works can save you (ie. sacrificing yourself for another person).  It's extremely honorable, but it won't save you.  <br>  <br>  3. The beliefs or morality of another person have no effect whatsoever on our own salvation.  <br>  <br>  4.  Once you've accepted Christ, you're saved and going to heaven.  If you decide to reject God after that, then you might jeopardize your salvation, but only because you cause the break, not because God did.  If you choose to let the other person die, it does not un-save you.  <br>  <br>  I hope I understood the questions and answered them satisfactorily.|`|t7aZZssLaa	For one thing, there is no "once saved always saved" (read Ezekiel chapter 18).

All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even one of a person's sins. <br>  <br>  Either Jesus pays for a person's sins, or that person pays for their sins in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before everyone. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!<br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|0puMsQJgaa	Simple Answer!<br>  <br>  GOD does not ask nor answer Hypothetical Questions!<br>  <br>  I as a Born Again Christian do not answer Hypothetical Questions!<br>  <br>  (Rev 20:14)  And death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire.

We all need Jesus for our salvation. God's offer is the same for all of us<br>  <br>  2. The heart transplant does not change the offer of God and how we respond to His offer. We need to make personal choice to follow Jesus<br>  <br>  3. The bottom line is if we accept Jesus as our God before we die we are going to be saved<br>  <br>  God asks us to be ready<br>  <br>  4. It is a personal relationship with God that saves, not with the pastor. We can talk directly to Christ. We do not get saved for anything we do, we need to accept Jesus offer of salvation though to be saved<br>  <br>  5. It is about the personal relationship with saving God. You either have this saving relationship of you do not.<br>  <br>  We have a lot of choices here on earth, but what comes to the eternal life, it is between hell and heaven. We get to choose

THAT is the problem.<br>  <br>  Apparently some weeks ago, the Palestinians, if I'm not too mixed up, reported that Israeli rockets exploded inside a school.  But then, reporters afterwards said the rocket exploded outside a school and no children were hurt.<br>  <br>  Also, in the Gulf war, Kuwait said that babies were tossed out of incubators and left to die.  The story was a lie. <br>  <br>  Some people who escaped American polygamy groups, have written books saying that 14 and 13 year old girls are forced in to marriage.

30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Strictly speaking it's not okay in Judaism or Christianity either, the injunction against usury is in the Old Testament.  As to the "why"f it, the God of Abraham, being God, saw no reason to explain Himself when He gave His laws, He just said "Do This, Don't Do That" and left it to humanity to obey or not.  Devout members of the Abrahamic faiths choose to obey, other people don't.  Simple as that.<br>  Just by way of info, there are Banks in the U.S. which provide Sharia acceptable mortgages for Islamic borrowers, so it's entirely possible to work around the restrictions.  Interestingly, those banks were the ones who were hit the least by the mortgage bubble collapse, the non-interest loans are still showing profits.|`|jHWEEZmCaa	because it's evil, because the banks uses poor people need for money, exploit them, destroy their life, islam is biased to poor people. take it or leave it.<br>  as for "islamic banking", the question is always, what happen to these people who can't pay, if they get hurt by manipulations then it's forbidden too. if they are not to talk both potentials of winning and loosing in their investment then it's not trade and it's forbidden, one of the most evil grand sins.<br>  the problem is in the modern monetary system where money loose its value. the rule is you shouldn't ever take more than you own, unless you're involved in a trade with potential win or loss.<br>  i don't know if it count that the bank might close and you loose your money.<br>  any way be careful, and be sure that god's alive and will take care of you, might test you for some time, you have to be patients and faithful, that as far as i know and don't know.|`|zjuRv62eaa	My guess if you have to pay credit card interest it's alright because of society today but charging interest is not.

There is no moral problem with a business loan that helps to create a profit in which both parties benefit. The Quran should not have taken the childishly-narrow solution of total abolishment.

Due to using unauthorized Bible versions, unbelief that the Bible is the Word of God, watered down gospel, refusal of dealing with sin, and the general antichrist spirit that prevails in the American church system there will be no real christians without real desperation among current believers. There are very few current Christians that actually do anything to promote the "kingdom of heaven and preaching the gospel" that Jesus directed us to do. <br>  I have found the Hispanic community has sincere Christians- so I bought a bilingual Bible and am attempting Span as 2nd language.

A lot of girls adopt the bisexual label because television and movies have made it fashionable for straight girls to "dabble" in same-sex relationships.  Others don't realize that same-sex attractions are normal during the teen years, but usually end when hormones drop to normal levels during late adolescence or early adulthood.  The bisexual label allows girls to satisfy their curiosity and test their boundaries without the risk of being labeled gay.  That's why most bisexuals don't get offended when people call them straight, but are militant about emphasizing their bisexuality when someone thinks they're gay.<br>  <br>  Don't get your hopes up about anything lasting with a confused and probably temporary bisexual.  Even if she does decide to pursue a relationship with you, the odds are hugely in favor of her running back to the security of heterosexuality once the novelty wears off and her curiosity is satisfied.|`|gspTDufpaa	A very messy situation.

Otherwise, the woman was just a prostitute.<br>  <br>  So it's not that premarital sex is technically a sin...it's when those people move on to other sexual partners...at that point they become adulterers.<br>  <br>  Sex is about a union between a man and woman...something sacred.

David R Hawkins did exstensive research on consciousness awareness, worth the reading, Power vs Force. Your question regarding "sin", sin is error and is correctable. Error does effect  your mind. We can within our own thought decide there is no God, and find others who will agree, but for this answer to continue, I must include truth. The universal laws of God, when understood in correct accurate interpretation will awaken you to the fact that everything done opposing set laws negatively effects your thoughts,your perception, thus your experience in this life as being heaven or hell. They are like the laws of gravity, jump off a two story building, your going to get injured or die. Although our true nature is spirit, we also have a primitive animal instinct(ego), that of survival and reproduction. These are the lower levels of awareness. Sex before marriage, or sex with another of the same sex results in lower energy levels deep in the conscious or subconscious mind. Will you trust your wife if you had sex before marriage? Suppose she works with a group of men, who may be considered more attractive, have more money, or an alluring character? The laws of the universe are what they are, break them and you will reap what you sew. One more thought, no matter what a person thinks he is, regarding sexuality, he is still what we all are, a piece, an expression of God, we are all created works of art, full of love, beauty , kindness and all goodness.

d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	1. In order to pray to God, you have to BELIEVE that He exists... otherwise who would you be praying TO?<br>  <br>  2. If you simply pray to "a god," that does not mean that you are praying to THE God.  Prayer to "a god" is not effective because "a god" does not exist, but prayer to THE God IS heard and answered because THE God DOES exist.<br>  <br>  3. You say... "all you need ot do is JUST pray to god OR repent to god OR ask god to show you the path."  "JUST" pray to god... no, it is what you pray to THE God about, AND how YOUR "heart" is set (repentant).  Then you say.. OR repent to god.  It's not an "OR" situation, it's an "AND" situation.  The "Path" you refer to... are you referring to the path of redemption and grace, or the path of growth in the faith AFTER the repentance?<br>  <br>  4. Why is the idea of praying to THE God and having Him answer you be unrealistic... or as you put it, magic or a miracle?  WHY can't it be TRUE and REAL... when it IS?  This is what is known as the "Leap of Faith."  Without faith, it is IMPOSSIBLE to understand all this nor to accept His salvation.  You must believe that He exists before you ask for His repentance, right? <br>  <br>  Some people think that simply praying will "do" things.  People have prayed to ALL sorts of gods, but there is only ONE TRUE and ONLY God that exists.  Regardless of what other things one believes in, if one does NOT believe that THE TRUE and ONLY God exists, NO prayer will be effective, or "helpful."<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a polite day.|`|ORFXYTj6aa	I would have to agree with Martin S on this one.All the rest were excellent answers but Martin hit the nail on the head.When some pray they expect something to happen like a lighten bolt hitting them in the head or an angel appearing before them.Sorry wont happen,but that's not to say that you wont know GOD answered your prayer.You will know but just not in the way folk think.Don't believe me,take Martins answer and try it and see.|`|AA10641825	I've never heard of a case where god prayed back anyway, I suspect they just pray thinking it will earn them extra points in heaven.<br>  .|`|jBYxEX8taa	It can be considered magic.

Miracles are only miraculous to us.  From God's point of view, they are utterly unsurprising.  If you look carefully, you will find that miracles are always connected in some way to this exact question: God's self-disclosure in the world.  If God exists, He can reveal Himself.  I'm pretty sure you'd agree about that.  So the question isn't whether miracles are possible.  It's whether God exists.<br>  <br>   I would never expect you to pray to a God you know isn't real.  What would be the possible point of that?  But if you were genuinely unsure, it would be reasonable to ask God to reveal Himself to you.  Not as a test or demand, but as an honest request.  The mistake would be to expect a parting of the sea or something in response.  You already have a historical account of that happening.  No.  It will most likely be something far more subtle.  An insight or light bulb coming on in your head where it all makes sense.  God has already come to earth, allowed Himself to be killed, and risen from the dead to prove Himself to us.  Look at it from His point of view.  Is demanding more than that really reasonable?  <br>  <br>  There is a difference between the words God and dog.  Dogs come when we call.  God calls and expects us to come.  Keeping straight who is master will help you as you work through things.<br>  <br>  peace

It states: “All should live in expectation of the coming of Christ, which a servant has with respect to the return of his Master, who, in departing for a season, left the management of his affairs to him; and of which management he is to give an exact account on his Master’s return.” [ See Vol. 3, Greek Scriptures, Matt. 24:45] <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The point being made by Clarke’s Commentary is that all of the master’s slaves are expected to take care of his affairs during his absence, for they must render an exact account when he returns.

TyRfv0eoaa	First, Zeus in Greek is pronounced Zefs, not Zoos. (Regardless of the pronunciation guides in some Christian lexicons. Ask any Greek.)<br>  <br>  The Greek alphabet is not equipped to properly represent certain sounds. It is impossible to write Yehoshua in Greek. No Greek word can  begin with the sound "ye", so they changed it to "Ie." Greek cannot have an H sound in the middle of a word. So they had to leave out that syllable. Greek has no way to represent the "SH" sound, so they changed it to an S. Finally, they added an S to the end to make it operate as a masculine Greek noun. (Most masculine Greek nouns end in os.)<br>  So Yehoshua became Iesous.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	.<br>  "Iesous" has nothing to do with Satan's protegee "Zeus"<br>  <br>  Jesus Name<br>  <br>  Yah – sh – ua = Hebrew<br>   - ↓ -  - ↓ - - ↓<br>  Ie - - - s - - ous = Greek<br>  - ↓ -  - ↓ - - ↓<br>  Ie - - - so - -us = Latin<br>  - ↓ -  - ↓ - - ↓<br>  Je - - -s - - us = English<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|7zbj4jU1aa	They could come from two different origins, or just may sound the same.

The Pentateuch was the first collection of literature acknowledged as Scripture by the Hebrew community. The writing of these books has been ascribed to Moses. It holds supreme rank in the Old Testament canon in respect and holiness.<br>  This Greek expression means "five scrolls" and was popularized by the Alexandria Jews in the first century A.D. who had come under the influence of Greek culture. The Hebrew-speaking Jewish community referred to these five books as "The Law," "Torah," or "The Law of Moses." <br>  The Historical books include Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1st and 2nd Samuel, 1st and 2nd Kings, 1st and 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther. These books share a prophetic view of history describing how the obedience or disobedience of God's people is directly tied to the blessings and curses of the covenant. In the Hebrew arrangement, Joshua, Judges, and the books of Samuel and Kings form a group of books called "the Former Prophets" due to the prophetic view from which they are written.<br>  The Poetic and Wisdom writings include Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. Unlike classical and modern poetry, ancient Hebrew poetry has no distinctive scheme of accentuation, meter, or rhythm to differentiate it from prose. It is noted for its parallelism, or the counterbalancing of ideas in phrases. To the Hebrews, wisdom included skill in living and the powers of observation. It also included the capacity of human intellect and the application of knowledge and experience to daily life. All of this came from a viewpoint that was firmly rooted in "the fear of the Lord," which is the beginning of wisdom.<br>  The Major Prophets include Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel. These books were declared "major" because of the amount of text, and not because they were considered more important than the "minor" prophetic books. The Old Testament prophet tended to be revealed during times of crisis. God used the prophets to provide direction and wisdom during times of crisis. They were also used by God to remind the people of their covenantal promises. <br>  The relevance of biblical prophecy is not only the information revealed to the audience about the circumstances being faced in their time or in a time to come, but also what the message reveals about the nature of God. Prophecy in the Bible is part of God's self-revelation, by which we come to know God through what he has done in the past and what He plans to do in the future. <br>  The Minor Prophets include Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. The books of the major and minor prophets were considered to be part of the "classical prophecy" era of the Old Testament. The classical prophecy era began in the eighth century during the reign of Jeroboam II in the northern kingdom of Israel. Amos and Hosea were the earliest examples in the north, while Micah and Isaiah were the first known classical prophets in the southern kingdom of Judah. These prophets addressed both the king and the people and became social-spiritual commentators for the Jewish people.|`|AA11616515	You will find that Christ divided them into the “law” the “prophets”  and Psalms.<br>  <br>  Many people divide them differently, below is how I have them divided.  <br>  <br>   <br>    “Original Paradise Administration” – This ends with the eviction from the Garden or Paradise.

The problem is that if you were not able to travel to the heavens or the depths of ****, you would be stuck in the 4th dimension until something or someone invites you to the universe of matter. And even if you traveled to the heavens, you would be a guardian angel to usually a family member. And what you would be (demon, poltergeist, ghost, etc.) would depend on your sins on your time living. Though if you went to the 16 century, you would have to be a ghost, which can travel freely through the 4th dimension when summoned. Because the 4th dimension is the dimension of time so if you travel freely through it, you can time travel. But you would have to be careful so your spirit doesn't get spagettified when you try to get to that time period. When you become a ghost, it's because something during your time had troubled you through life so you must accomplish that goal of tying loose ends or you must be exorcised. The only thing that I'm not sure of is whether or not spirits can travel through the multiverse if you died in this universe.|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	Through Jesus Christ, I have life after physical death. <br>  <br>  John 6:47<br>  I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	Possible, but not likely enough for me to live an unhappy life making sure that I am perfect for that afterlife.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believe in Jesus alone for salvation or not. <br>  <br>  So to be in heaven and not hell, believe in Jesus alone for salvation now! :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus!

You may choose to experience Oneness with all that is.  And you will have a chance to decide what you wish to be, do, and have next.<br>  <br>  Do you choose to return to your most recent body?  Do you choose to experience life again in human form, but of another kind?<br>  <br>  Do you choose to remain where you are in the "spirit world" at the level you are then experiencing?  Do you choose to go on, go further, in your knowing and experiencing?  Do you choose to "lose your identity" altogether and now become part of the Oneness?<br>  <br>  What do you choose?  What do you choose?  What do you choose?<br>  <br>  Always, that question I will be asking you, always that is the inquiry of the universe.  For the universe knows nothing except how to grant your fondest wish, your greatest desire.  Indeed, it is doing that every moment, every day.

Ask difficult questions about God - How does she KNOW Christianity is the correct belief when so many others think they have the right belief? Why does God let little children suffer? Tell her you think the church you would prefer to go to would make you less likely to question your faith - most likely she would rather have you as a Christian but going to a different church than for you to become an Atheist.

FGcwxZz0aa	First of all it is disingenuous to state that the practice of praying for each other has no biblical foundation, we are instructed in Scripture to have a prayer life for others as it is part of God’s commandment to love one another. <br>  <br>  (2Co 5:8 DRB) But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from the body and to be present with the Lord.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church does not teach that it is absolutely necessary for one to ask for the intercession of saints for salvation. The Church does teach that prayer to God is necessary for salvation for all believers. For a Catholic it would be wrong to ignore the liturgical worship offered to God at feast days for the saints and the prayers asking for their intercession.<br>  <br>  The Communion of Saints is a dogma of the ancient Church and is recorded in the apostles Creed. It simply states that the faithful because of their relationship with Christ are alive even after the death of their flesh and worship with us. To us the Church is made up of the Church militant who represents all those believers living out their hope in the flesh.<br>  <br>  (Phi 2:12 DRB) Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but much more now in my absence) with fear and trembling work out your salvation.<br>  <br>  (Phi 2:13 DRB) For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.<br>  <br>  It consists of the Church Suffering who are those who are temporarily in need of further purgation from sin so that they may enjoy the presence of God.<br>  <br>  (2Ma 12:46 DRB) It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the Communion of the Saints consists of those who have won the race:<br>  <br>  (Phi 3:14 DRB) I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  Their immortal souls are in heaven in God’s presence:<br>  <br>  (Rev 5:8 DRB) And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.<br>  <br>  The universal stream connecting all of God’s creation is His love, which we take on in our baptism into our journey towards sanctification. This is not an emotional but a desire placed in us by the Spirit of God that endures as a desire for those other than ourselves and this love extends even to our enemies. This is truly a love that comes only from God and is a foreign concept and nonsense to those who have not received God’s salvific grace. This desire within our souls does not end with the death of our flesh but continues into eternity where the saints through their intercession in prayer encourage us in our race and assist us to endure unto our union with God.<br>  <br>  I think that some people of faith, who do not understand the Communion of Saints, somehow believe that asking saints to pray for us is detracting from our love or our trust in God. In truth it is impossible, if we truly love as God commands and has given us the grace to understand, not to pray to those whom we love and in turn we expect them to return that same love to us by praying for us and presenting our prayers to God. <br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|cFrtOg45aa	Principal Roman Catholic prayer addressed to the Virgin Mary. It begins with the greetings spoken to Mary by the Archangel Gabriel and by her cousin Elizabeth in the Gospel of Luke: "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus." A closing petition, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death," came into general use by the end of the 14th century. Churchgoers who attend confession are often asked to repeat the prayer as penance for sins.|`|wND7qPTWaa	God's commandment "thou shall not make a graven image" is entirely connected to the worship of false gods. God does not prohibit images to be used in worship, but He prohibits the images themselves to be worshiped. <br>  <br>  The only image of God that Catholics worship is Jesus Christ, who is the "image" of the invisible God. <br>  Our statues and other icons help us to see and inspire us to meditate on the specific divine realities they mean to convey.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	Gee, I hope you've never asked a friend at church or a family member to pray for you. If you have, you're guilty of asking for intercessory prayer. <br>  <br>  That's precisely what we Catholics do when we ask Mary and the saints to pray for us, so if we're "worshiping" Mary, then I guess that means you're worshiping your friends and family, right? Shame on you!<br>  <br>  I'll stick to praying the very Biblical "Hail Mary" (the words spoken to Mary by the archangel Gabriel and Mary's cousin Elizabeth under the control of the Holy Spirit.) It beats the babbling and yelling that passes for "prayer" in so many fundamentalist churches.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	The Hail Mary is a combination of two quotes from the Gospel of Luke and a request that Mary pray for us.<br>  <br>  Quoting the Bible is not worshiping Mary.<br>  Asking Mary to pray for us is not worshiping Mary.<br>  <br>  Worship is an action that involves adoring, praising and recognizing God as the Supreme Being over all. Catholics don't do that with Mary. We don't think of her as some kind of goddess.<br>  <br>  Catholics DO pray directly to the Lord, all the time. You can pray to God and also pray to Mary, you know. They are not mutually exclusive actions. <br>  <br>  Yes, Catholics believe that Mary was a virgin when she gave birth to Jesus. It's in the Bible, and almost every Christian denomination believes in it, too.<br>  <br>  Yes, Catholics believe that Jesus saved Mary from sin before she was born. If He hadn't, she would not have been a fitting mother for our Lord and Savior.|`|AA11796124	<<Catholic what exactly is a hail mary?>><br>  <br>  "Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee." comes form the Bible. Those are the words that the Angel Gabriel greeted Mary.<br>  <br>  "Blessed are you among women, and Blessed is the Fruit of thy womb" also comes form the Bible. Those are the words that Elizabeth greeted Mary with when she came to visit her cousin.<br>  <br>  The rest is a petition for Mary to pray for sinners. Intercessory Prayer to Mary and the Saints IS Biblical:<br>  <br>  Mary is our Mother and Queen of the New Davidic Kingdom<br>  John 19:26 - Jesus makes Mary the Mother of us all as He dies on the Cross by saying "behold your mother." Jesus did not say "John, behold your mother" because he gave Mary to all of us, his beloved disciples. All the words that Jesus spoke on Cross had a divine purpose. Jesus was not just telling John to take care of his mother.<br>  <br>  Rev. 12:17 - this verse proves the meaning of John 19:26. The "woman's" (Mary's) offspring are those who follow Jesus. She is our Mother and we are her offspring in Jesus Christ. The master plan of God's covenant love for us is family. But we cannot be a complete family with the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Christ without the Motherhood of Mary.<br>  <br>  John 2:3 - this is a very signifcant verse in Scripture. As our mother, Mary tells all of us to do whatever Jesus tells us. Further, Mary's intercession at the marriage feast in Cana triggers Jesus' ministry and a foreshadowing of the Eucharistic celebration of the Lamb. This celebration unites all believers into one famiy through the marriage of divinity and humanity. <br>  <br>  John 2:7 - Jesus allows His mother to intercede for the people on His behalf, and responds to His mother's request by ordering the servants to fill the jars with water. <br>  <br>  Psalm 45:9 - the psalmist teaches that the Queen stands at the right hand of God. The role of the Queen is important in God's kingdom. Mary the Queen of heaven is at the right hand of the Son of God.<br>  <br>  1 Kings 2:17, 20 - in the Old Testament Davidic kingdom, the King does not refuse his mother. Jesus is the new Davidic King, and He does not refuse the requests of his mother Mary, the Queen.<br>  <br>  1 Kings 2:18 - in the Old Testament Davidic kingdom, the Queen intercedes on behalf of the King's followers. She is the Queen Mother (or "Gebirah"). Mary is our eternal Gebirah.<br>  <br>  1 Kings 2:19 - in the Old Testament Davidic kingdom the King bows down to his mother and she sits at his right hand. We, as children of the New Covenant, should imitate our King and pay the same homage to Mary our Mother. By honoring Mary, we honor our King, Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  1 Kings 15:13 - the Queen Mother is a powerful position in Israel's royal monarchy. Here the Queen is removed from office. But now, the Davidic kingdom is perfected by Jesus, and our Mother Mary is forever at His right hand.<br>  <br>  2 Chron. 22:10 - here Queen Mother Athalia destroys the royal family of Judah after she sees her son, King Ahaziah, dead. The Queen mother plays a significant role in the kingdom.<br>  <br>  Neh. 2:6 - the Queen Mother sits beside the King. She is the primary intercessor before the King.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What exactly is a hail mary and how is that not worshiping mary.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	the first is from the gospel of Luke and the rest is asking her intercession.  yes we do believe that because if you read about the wedding at canna ...... Jesus listened to Mary over His own Father!|`|LuN1unJ3aa	So you believe that if you ask someone to help for you, you are worshiping them?<br>  <br>  Strange concept.<br>  <br>  That's all prayers to Mary are... asking for help. And it isn't worship any more than if you ask someone you know for help doing something you can't do for yourself.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, I agree that a direct approach also works, but unlike you, I also believe that the more than I can get to pray for whatever I need, the more it will help.|`|AA10034051	Luke 1:28 -"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you." These are the words spoken by God and delivered to us by the angel Gabriel (who is a messenger of God). Thus, when Catholics recite this verse while praying the Rosary(the Gospel of Jesus Christ), they are uttering the words of God.|`|sjMIFH9Faa	Whats your beef with the Hail Mary? Have you actually read it, because nothing in it is against Catholic or Protestant teaching.<br>  <br>  Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. <br>  <br>  Hail, or Ave in latin, simply is a way to say hello, and in order to go to heaven, you must be blessed with God's grace. And both Christ and Mary are reunited in heaven. Anything wrong with that..nope 1st line....OK<br>  <br>  Blessed art thou amoungst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<br>  <br>  I certinly hope that you see Christ as blessed. Also, only after giving birth to Gods son can a woman claim to be "most blessed woman." You believe Mary gave birth the Christ..right? 2nd line...OK<br>  <br>  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. <br>  <br>  Jesus is God, Mary is mother of Jesus, ergo Mary is the mother of God. Note, that doesn't mean she has authority over the Father. And whats wrong with Mary praying for sinners? We are all sinners, right? 3rd line....OK<br>  <br>  <br>  SO WHATS WRONG WITH THE HAIL MARY? I mean really, nothing said is against any Christian theology, the only problems Protestants have with it is that Catholics say it. Really, thats is. If your son or daughter wrote it at school one day, you would find it touching. But because Catholics say it, its evil and sacreligious.|`|HMteUyRdaa	It is the salutation of the angel St.Gabriel to announce the conception and birth of Christ is at hand.<br>  <br>  Luke 1:28 And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. 29 Who having heard, was troubled at his saying, and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be. 30 And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God. <br>  <br>  31 Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus. 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever. 33 And of his kingdom there shall be no end. 34 And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man? 35 And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. <br>  <br>  and completed by Mary's cousin Elizabeth in Luke 1:41 And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: 42 And she cried out with a loud voice, and said: Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. 43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 44 For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. 45 And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord. <br>  <br>  And our Lady's reply was the most glorious prayer to the Most Holy Trinity paying more homeage then anyone person ever has.<br>  (Mystical City of God, Mary of Agreda)<br>  <br>  Luke1:46 And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord. 47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. 48 Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. 49 Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; and holy is his name. 50 And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him. <br>  <br>  48 "Shall call me blessed"... These words are a prediction of that honour which the church in all ages should pay to the Blessed Virgin. Let Protestants examine whether they are any way concerned in this prophecy. <br>  <br>  51 He hath showed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart. 52 He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the humble. 53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. 54 He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy: 55 As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.<br>  <br>  Do you fail to see the hail Mary prayer in these above verses? Do you fail to realize that through this prayer we are only asking Her to raise Her voice in unison with ours. And do you fail to see that we are glorying our Lord and Savior every single time we utter this prayer, it is not only a prayer of petition to Her to help us in our prayers but it is a prayer to God paying Him honor and glory for giving us this prayer, this Lady, and the Divine Word.<br>  <br>  Ok then.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Kate|`|VFWRdAH3aa	Each line of the Hail Mary prayer is found in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew.<br>  Lk 1:28<br>  Lk 1:41-43<br>  Lk 1:48<br>  Lk 2:35<br>  Mt 7:17-18<br>  <br>  We do pray directly to God but we also ask those in Heaven and our family and friends to pray for us too. <br>  <br>  Yes she was a virgin when she gave birth to Jesus. Read the Gospel of Luke 1:28-38<br>  <br>  In order to be able to be born flesh in this world Jesus needed a woman pure and free from original sin. God choose Mary to be the Mother of Our Savior and spared her from the stain of Original Sin|`|QQ2rTaPdaa	Football wise a Hail Mary is when you close your eyes and fling a football as far down field as you can, while praying your *** off that someone with a jersey the same color as yours catches it.|`|0fnzDpKXaa	They are words taken directly from the book of St. Luke.  I really don't know why you have such a bug up your butt about Catholics lately.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Catholics can and DO pray directly to God as well.  Look up "intercessory prayer".|`|LQQAQDkIaa	We quote scripture in the 1st half of the Hail Mary, we ask for her prayers in the 2nd half. Have you never asked anyone to pray for you?|`|hzMpdFFBaa	It's a prayer that is actually in the Bible. It's what Elizabeth said to Mary when Mary visited her. Read it and then you'll know what the "hail Mary" is and whether people who pray it are "worshipping" Mary" or merely reverently addressing her because she is "the mother of God,"  after all.<br>  <br>  You can pray "directly to God" if you want to. In fact, if you spent more time practicing your own religion instead of criticizing how others practice theirs, the world might be a much nicer place. Don't ya' think?|`|71qGan9Raa	The Catholics say, "Hail Mary" because that is what was said in the bible when the angel came to her. The Angel made that prayer, "Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with thee, Blessed are thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus."  <br>  <br>  While meditating, the Catholics are reflecting on 5 of the mysteries (Joyful, Sorrowful or something else). It's all about Jesus's life, death and resurrection. <br>  <br>  Yes, many people believe that Jesus cannot say NO to his mother. Many miracles have happened because of the rosary. <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't say the rosary anymore because I just go directly to God but if I was in dire need and was willing to try anything, sure, I'd go back to the Rosary. <br>  <br>  She is a wonderful, beautiful lady!!!!|`|gw1N4IF7aa	First of all we are not WORSHIPING her we are HONORING her. She gave birth as a virgin to Jesus and never comitted sin. God listens to everyone, but isn't it nice to have a ton of people pray for you. She is most likely to be sincere about it and mean it. We honor people all the time famous football players. I am sure that people channel them while playing football. I channel Shawn Johnson when I do gymnastics. It is similar. We ask for her to pray for us to have a sincere request to God. We don't worship Mary<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!|`|FjiRPKp2aa	Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with you blessed are you and blessed is the fruit of your womb.<br>  This comes straight from the gospel. That is what St. Elizabeth said when Mary visited her while she was pregnant with St. John the baptist.<br>  The prayer is straight from the bible. It is a form of loving those who love Jesus together.|`|syBBnsCAaa	The first part of the Hail Mary is  quote from the Bible. A salutation from the arch-angel St.Gabriel. The second part is a request for her prayers to God. The worship remains directed to God. The prayer is a request for her to prayer for us.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	do you listen to your mother?<br>  <br>  Hail, Mary!

We ask Mary for prayers like you would ask a friend to pray for you, except the Bible says that the prayers of the righteous are effective. Mary is in heaven, alive in Christ like all the other saints, plus she is His Mother, so her prayers are effective, just like when she interceded at the wedding of Cana.<br>  <br>  We do believe she is sinless, because of the meaning of the Greek chaire Kecharitomene (full of grace) in the Scriptures and because Jesus was sinless.

cfda9b5d078d37da24e0ff1809dee8d5aa	It's not a pentagram, it's merely a five-pointed star.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	The pentagram, inverted or not, isn't always 'Satanic'.<br>  <br>  Pentagrams (inverted ones, too) came out of Mesopotamia as a symbol for various things, including mathematical stuff and some religious things. Since then, the symbol has been all over the world; it has been used by many cultures and religions, including Christianity.<br>  <br>  With Christianity, it represented the Five Wounds of Christ, among other things. The Masons used it for mathematical things, if I recall right... It IS most commonly used by "neo pagans" these days as a symbol of their path, the five elements, balance, etc. It can also be used inverted by Wiccans (I think) to indicate someone who is a Second Degree initiate into a tradition. And of course, Satanists do use it, too... The reason Satanists tend to invert it is because the upward-pointing pentagram sends energy outward into the universe, while Satanists (at least Theistic ones of the tradition I follow) believe in sending energy back down into the Earth. Or... well, some Satanists do it just to freak people out. :P But those tend to be the LaVeyans.<br>  <br>  So the Mormons might use it for any reason, too, though I don't recall Mormons using the pentagram at all. It's likely just something to do with Christ.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	Its not the star that is called into question its the moon stone, the jupiter stone, the big dipper, the sun stone ect that are also ont he temples.<br>  DEU. 17:2-3<br>  2If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant, <br>  <br>   3And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded; <br>  <a href="http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/saltlake/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/saltlake...</a>|`|MSWgVj4Maa	If i recall that is only the one temple and it was designed by old Joseph Smith himself.

The treatment of the symbol as "demonic" is a culturally recent innovation, much like the swaztika which for over ten thousand years was a symbol of good fortune, the natural order, the flow of seasons, recently (in cultural terms) being turned around and made a symbol of hate and death.
UajbVdM4aa	Tell your mom that you are not Christian and that if you don't want him to go to church or learn abot it that she shouldn't . Also tell her the reason why you don't want your son to know about christianity.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Well first off, don't fight with people about religion when they're that old. It's weird to say, but they have it burnt into their head, because that's what it was like when they were growing up. At that age everyone is religious in some way. <br>  <br>  My advice is to educate your son and let him make his decisions. Be respectful to the elders, no matter how crazy their beliefs are. When they're gone, they're gone. If you spend their last years in a fight with them, you'll regret it. <br>  <br>  -Atheist|`|fEkKuGlEaa	You've got to put your foot down, which it sounds like you are trying to do. You are his mom, and it is your place to decide what he's ready for. And as a Christian, it kills me to think your son would be put in a position to think Jesus made his grandma mean. <br>  <br>  I can't imagine a little boy could say anything about church that would make a normal, balanced person react in such a vehement way. My kids have always gone to church and have said some doozies of things about it, but that's what little kids do! They're just being honest. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you'll have to insist on supervised visitation for awhile until you can get it through to her that it's upsetting to him. I would think she wouldn't want to make church and Jesus odious to him. <br>  <br>  You seem like a really good mom and good daughter--all the best to you.<br>  <br>  Add--lol at Jesus being a copycat. Sounds like something my son would have said!|`|HIskrREJaa	I think you should let her apologize for you son's benefit, not necessarily for her benefit... then tell her that after the situation from the other day you have decided that the subject is off limits unless you give her permission to speak to him about it.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	if you've already informed her that you don't wish to talk about the subject, ignore her and limit the amount of time she is with you and your family.|`|ZUL3drNgaa	Maybe you could tell her that it's great that she wants to talk about her religion and is proud of it and all, but not to try to force it upon her grandson. It's heartbreaking, to me what he said about her being "made mean." Just calmly tell her that you don't want your son to feel like he has to be any particular religion, but that you'd rather him choose his own way, and also that you don't want his relationship with her to be bad. Let her apologize in a way that does not bring up Christianity. Then you should be good => i hope i helped.|`|f8CN2qIvaa	Tell her that you accept her apology, but she is to mind her own business when it comes to religion.  She also needs to apologize to your son personally.  A five year old will say what he thinks, and she had no excuse for getting angry with him.  Don't let her interfere with him like that again, and make it very clear that religion is a closed subject around your son.  He'll make up his own mind on the matter when he is old enough.  It reminds me of something that happened years ago.  My parents had neighbors who were very religious.  The mother was outside reading their young son a book about God.  Suddenly, he started running around the yard yelling "God is dumb! God is dumb!".  She panicked...but my dad thought it was kind of funny.|`|e599f8e9840310f064e7afa7423bfa60aa	You can't.  If you want you're mother's help raising your child, you will have to accept who she is.  People who have great faith feel the need to spread the word.  It's almost like an addiction.  They just can't stop.  Probably because speaking about it is part of accepting it.  Either way, you won't be able to have her respect your wishes.  Sorry to say it that way, but it is what it is.|`|82AAOxCfaa	you are the mother of your child and your mother should not over step her boundaries. just keep your distance for a while till all of this cools off. your son should see his grandmother.<br>  <br>  when your son is old enough he will make up his own mind about Christianity.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	just say"you are free to be a part of his family.but you can't bring your religion into it in any way. i'm not raising him in your religious persuasion.therefore, if you can't keep your religious feelings to yourself.

I would give a few months "cooling off" time to your mom.  Honestly, she is making her own bed here - she's going to have to lie in it.  She's creating a lot of fear in your son and she's turning him off Jesus faster than anybody who was set on that agenda.<br>  <br>  I would tell her, calmly, how this impacted him and that you feel it's hurt their relationship.  I would add "until he feels comfortable being around you again, he's not going to be."  If she whines tell her "you did this to yourself mom."|`|MUEMs2ataa	Just tell her what you think, and tell your Mother that he will make up his own mind about religion when he is older..

cfdaa128dfa2a07a157aa79c35d7f3abaa	Either someone has asked Christ to come into their heart all the way and committed themselves fully to obeying God or they have not.  There is no room for any elitism.  You either are truly a Christian or you are not.  Either you have crucified your flesh, or your flesh is still active.

(Remember the widow's mite?)<br>  <br>  That being said...Christianity, like pretty much everything else in life, is a matter of "walk the walk not just talk the talk." Back during Operation Iraqi Freedom people were, and quite correctly in my view, going up to the loud, outspoken, pro-war Young Republicans and College Republicans types and saying "If you support the war so strongly why haven't you enlisted?"  I think that is a perfectly valid question; and I think the same thing applies to Christianity. If you take your beliefs seriously you put them into action.|`|U51pBeLfaa	If a Christian says that another Christian is not real then logically one or both could be lying. The criteria that Jesus gave was that we would know each other by our love for each other. If you see a Christian full of hate you could reasonably conclude that that person was not a Christian. So the answer is how the bible describes a real Christian is a real Christian.<br>  <br>  Constructive criticism of Christians is important and I would imagine most Christians  would welcome being rebuked in love. Not that anyone likes being criticized.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	People give it away sometimes. Something in what they say clues a Christian who knows the Bible in on the fact that a person who said they were Christian really doesn't know what a Christian is.<br>  <br>  I've talked to some people who thought being a Christian meant "being good", or going to church on Sunday.

You cant get into Heaven by good deeds or studying or going to church. You have to accept Jesus into your life and turn from your sins.

For God will reveal the secrets of peoples and their motives publicly in His Court insofar as He so Chooses.<br>  <br>  Destiny is in the hands of The One True God and only to Him.<br>  <br>  Those whom are predestined are forechose is written, those forechosen are destined to be conformed into the likeness of the image of the new creation at the resurrection.<br>  <br>  Such a saying is like gravity and applies to the whole loaf like The Kingdom of God whose Angels look out for all peoples and do not discriminate.  For He Will have Mercy upon Whomsoever He Desires as written in Moses.<br>  <br>  And do not judge by mere appearances for those who suffered in this world are found in the bossom of Abraham for The Lord had already ordained in The Prophets this Word; Many of Those who I formerly did not withhold Judgment from will have Mercy of that day while many of those who had the worldly and supposed 'mercies' in this world will not.  For what would it mean to us if The Lord was hardening some up for the Day of Judgment while the objects of Mercy were scorned and hated.  What a Mystery.  When someone does their time for crimes; the Judge says time served and the sentence ends.  So then, Blessed are the Merciful is written.  Many who were considered 'great' will be called the least among the peoples and many called the least will be called loved by Him.  For to gain honor in promotion Jesus told us to take the least position possible.|`|fb32217e975ff5844cd7200fbf61284caa	No one can be more Christian than anyone else.  Being Christian is not a dimmer switch, but rather a simple "On-Off" switch.  You either accept Jesus Christ as your saviour from sin and attempt to model your life on His teachings, or you don't.<br>  <br>  Of course it is possible to state or pretend you are Christian when you are not.  Why anyone would want to do that in the current day and age is beyond me, since it is no longer an advantage in society the way it was in past centuries.  All churches probably have such pretenders amongst their members, but we are instructed not to judge them.  The parable of the wheat and the tares shows this clearly:  Leave judgement to God.<br>  <br>  Some churches have a problem with those who believed at some time and no longer believe, because they base faith on a conversion experience.  Supposedly, anyone who has received that conversion experience can never fall away.  This requires them to insist that Judas had never accepted Jesus, rather than to consider Judas in his full complexity of struggle between belief and unbelief, love and betrayal.  Their overstress on the conversion experience leads them to make such judgements on others.|`|uQJnkwFVaa	When someone says he/she is Christian, that doesn't mean that person is Christian. In order to be Christian-like that person most live a life devoted to Jesus. So I believe a true Christian isn't the one who says he/ she is, but the one who demonstrates it. Christians sin too because we aren't perfect but if we ask forgiveness and try to work on our weaknesses then the important fact is that we are trying, but that doesn't mean we are less Christian than others. It's all about the inner intentions, wether you are really trying to live life as God wants or as you want, an the real intentions only God can see, so we can't judge, because maybe a person who goes to church and never misses one service can be a fake christian. The important deal is to meet personally a person because I believe that your mouth speaks what lies in your heart and no matter how you try to hide something, it will show someday. How to know who's a real Christian? By his actions, not only by his words. Hope this helps... God Bless U!!!|`|AA11374244	I believe a christian is a follower of Christ.

If we read the bible correctly we see that no man pleases God. and some who say they are christian are not considered a christian by Christ (Math 36:41).   So who is a true christian then.  The truth is only God knows.  he is the one who saves his people, he does not do it by accounting our own work. for our work is is liken filthy rags.  He turns a fallen mans heart of stone to a heart of flesh and only then can we understand that we are no better than any other man that is on this created world. we are sinful and wicked and only God saves us through Christ. Let me reiterate this one point;    ALL MEN HAVE FALLEN AND COME SHORT OF GODS GLORY.  This means that God looks at all men as sinful and unrighteous. only Christ is righteous and only His blood cleanses us of sin and saves us from God's wrath.  To be honest a true christian is still a sinner and needs to repent because he still is in the flesh.  So take heed and know that all christians have flaws and only God is the one who saves us. not for our deeds or works but cause he has chosen you and many others to do his will and bring others who hear his word to eternal life.

The actual term "fundamentalist" is connected directly with the American Biblical Congress held at Niagara, New York, in 1895.<br>  <br>   At this meeting, conservative Protestant exegetes defined "five points of fundamentalism": the verbal inerrancy of Scripture, the divinity of Christ, his virginal birth, the doctrine of vicarious expiation and the bodily resurrection at the time of the second coming of Christ. <br>  <br>  Fundamentalists way of reading the Bible spread to other parts of the world, it gave rise to other ways of interpretation, equally "literalist," in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. As the 20th century comes to an end, this kind of interpretation is winning more and more adherents, in religious groups and sects, as also among Catholics.<br>  <br>  Fundamentalism is right to insist on the divine inspiration of the Bible, the inerrancy of the Word of God and other biblical truths included in its five fundamental points.<br>  <br>   But their way of presenting these truths is rooted in an ideology which is not biblical, whatever the proponents of his approach might say.<br>  <br>   For it demands an unshakable adherence to rigid doctrinal points of view and imposes, as the only source of teaching for Christian life and salvation, a reading of the Bible which rejects all questioning and any kind of critical research. <br>  <br>   The basic problem with Fundamentalist interpretation of this kind is that, refusing to take into account the historical character of biblical revelation, it makes itself incapable of accepting the full truth of the Incarnation itself.<br>  <br>   As regards relationships with God, Fundamentalism seeks to escape any closeness of the divine and the human. It refuses to admit that the inspired Word of God has been expressed in human language and that this Word has been expressed, under divine inspiration, by human authors possessed of limited capacities and resources.<br>  <br>   For this reason, Fundamentalism tends to treat the biblical text as if it had been dictated word for word by the Spirit. It fails to recognize that the Word of God has been formulated in language and expression conditioned by various periods. <br>  <br>  It pays no attention to the literary norms and to the human ways of thinking to be found in the biblical texts, many of which are the result of a process extending over long periods of time and bearing the mark of very diverse historical situations.<br>  <br>   Fundamentalism also places undue stress upon the inerrancy of certain details in the biblical texts, especially in what concerns historical events or supposedly scientific truth. <br>  <br>  Fundamentalism often historicizes material which from the start never claimed to be historical. It considers historical everything that is reported or recounted with verbs in the past tense, failing to take the necessary account of the possibility of symbolic or figurative meaning. <br>  <br>   Fundamentalists often shows a tendency to ignore or to deny the problems presented by the biblical text in its original Hebrew, Aramaic or Greek form. It is often narrowly bound to one fixed translation, whether old or present-day.<br>  <br>   By the same token, it fails to take account of the "re-readings" (relectures) of certain texts which are found within the Bible itself.<br>  <br>   In what concerns the Gospels, Fundamentalism does not take into account the development of the gospel tradition, but naively confuses the final stage of this tradition (what the evangelists have written) with the initial (the words and deeds of the historical Jesus). <br>  At the same time Fundamentalism neglects an important fact: the way in which the first Christian communities themselves understood the impact produced by Jesus of Nazareth and his message.<br>  <br>   But it is precisely there that we find a witness to the apostolic origin of the Christian faith and its direct expression. Fundamentalism thus misrepresents the call voiced by the gospel itself. <br>  <br>   Fundamentalism likewise tends to adopt very narrow points of view. They accept the literal reality of an ancient, out-of-date cosmology, simply because it is found expressed in the Bible; this blocks any dialogue with a broader way of seeing the relationship between culture and faith.<br>  <br>   Its relying upon a non-critical reading of certain texts of the Bible serves to reinforce political ideas and social attitudes that are marked by prejudices-racism, for example-quite contrary to the Christian gospel.<br>  <br>   Finally, in its attachment to the principle "Scripture alone," Fundamentalism separates the interpretation of the Bible from the Tradition, which, guided by the Spirit, has authentically developed in union with Scripture in the heart of the community of faith.<br>  <br>   It fails to realize that the New Testament took form within the Christian Church and that it is the Holy Scripture of this Church, the existence of which preceded the composition of the texts.<br>  <br>   Because of thi|`|AA12048147	If you are NOT a believer, a Saint, a member of the Body of Christ, anything said or explanation given does you no good ....

nQvcqVkNaa	Before Yhshua/Jesus came to earth, the pagan Romans believed in a pagan trinity god.<br>  when the pagan Roman emperor decided it would be in the best interest of his government to control the Christian congregation, he gathered all the religious leaders to a council at Nicea in 325 A.D. to figure out how they could mix the popular pagan rituals, traditions, festivals and beliefs with this growing new cult of Christianity. <br>  <br>  They basically came up with a plan of changing the names of all the pagan, false god worshipping rituals that they knew the pagan Romans would not tolerate giving up and gave those rituals that dishonor and anger "the only true God" (John 17:3) YHWH/Jehovah a "christian" facade.<br>  It is like spray painting a dog turd gold and trying to sell it to God as a precious metal!<br>  <br>  The ancient pagan trinity god is one of those golden dog turds that angers the Almighty God and Father who Yhshua/Jesus serves.<br>  <br>  Yhshua/Jesus made it quite clear in his own words and the things he taught his Apostles that he is *not* equal to his God YHWH/Jehovah. (Acts 3:13)<br>  Yhshua/Jesus always submits to YHWH/Jehovah's will and never considered himself equal to his God (Philippians 2:5-11 & 1 Corinthians 15:24-28)<br>  <br>  Jesus is our role model. Everything he did, we are supposed to do (1 Peter 2:21; John 13:15-17) He preached about his Father Jehovah, he made known the name of his Father Jehovah, he prayed to his Father Jehovah, he served his Father Jehovah (John 12:28 & John 17:26 & Matthew 26:39-42 & Matthew 20:23 & Luke 22:29 & John 8:54 & Acts 3:13) A true Christian does as Jesus did. You can not serve Christ's Father the way Christ did if you do not know (or refuse to use) His name Jehovah. Are you worshipping the God that Jesus worships? You certainly wouldn't want to be denying Jesus words (John 20:17 & Revelation 3:12 & Mark 15:34) or the truth that he taught to his apostles (Acts 3:13 & 1 Corinthians 15:24-28) Anyone who claims that Jesus is equal to Jehovah is opposing Jesus own words and is thereby blinded as mentioned at 2 Corinthians 11:3, 4. Jesus own words condemn any notion that he is equal to Jehovah (Philippians 2:5-7)<br>  Satan has successfully had Jehovah's name removed from most Bibles now. Satan has also convinced many that it is right to murder for their country and that it is ok to carry on celebrations rooted in pagan worship to false gods. Most people who call themselves christian today are false christians (Matthew 7:21-23) They are on the broad road to destruction (Matthew 7:13) but only those few that are doing the will of Christ's Father (Matthew 7:21) are on the narrow road to life (Matthew 7:14)<br>  <br>  Jesus is speaking in the following Scriptures, if you blindly support the trinity god then it is tantamount to calling Jesus a liar!<br>  I do not think he was lying or even being cryptographic when he said the following things:<br>  John 20:17 - Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' "<br>  John 17:3-5 - Jesus prayed “Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.”<br>  John 5:19 - Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.<br>  John 14:28 - "You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.”<br>  Mark 10:18 - "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good—except God alone.”<br>  Matthew 26:39 - Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."<br>  John 8:17-18 - “In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid. I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me." (Clearly two separate persons)<br>  Mark 13:32 - "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.”<br>  Matthew 20:23 - Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father."<br>  <br>  Jesus prayed to his God Jehovah:<br>  Matthew 14:23 - After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone<br>  Mark 1:35 - Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.<br>  Mark 6:46 - After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.<br>  Mark 14:32 - They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."<br>  Luke 6:12 - One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.<br>  <br>  Jesus sits at the right hand of Jehovah, he is not the same person as Jehovah:<br>  Matthew 26:64 - "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."<br>  Mark 14:61-62 - But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. <br>  Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?" <br>  "I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."<br>  Luke 22:69 - “But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."<br>  Matthew 3:17 - And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."<br>  Revelation 3:12 - Jesus speaking to John says: “Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on him my new name.”<br>  Acts 7:55-56 - But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 56"Look," he said, "I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."<br>  Romans 8:34 - Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.<br>  <br>  Jesus taught the apostles that he serves Jehovah:<br>  Acts 3:13 - The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go.<br>  Ephesians 1:17-20 - I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength, which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms<br>  <br>  Unlike satan, who was also in spirit form, Jesus would never try to usurp Jehovah’s authority:<br>  Philippians 2:6 - although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.<br>  <br>  Jehovah grants Jesus his position:<br>  Acts 5:30-31 - The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead—whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.<br>  1 Peter 3:22 - who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.<br>  Acts 2:33-36 - Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, <br>  Jehovah said to my Lord: <br>  "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." <br>  Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.<br>  Psalm 110:1 - A Psalm of David. The affirmation of Jehovah to my Lord: `Sit at My right hand, Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.'<br>  Hebrews 10:12-13 - He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD, waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET.<br>  In the future in heaven, after death is finally no more, Jesus will subject everything back to Jehovah who had put everything under Jesus: 1 Corinthians 15:24-28 - then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power. For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The last enemy that will be abolished is death. For HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET But when He says, "All things are put in subjection," it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him. When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	John 10:30-32- I and the Father are One.|`|UinOWcMUaa	yeah.. for sure but then How do you explain these verse's :<br>  <br>  "I and the Father are one." The Jews took up stones again to stone Him. Jesus answered them, "I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?" The Jews answered Him, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God." (John 10:30-33)<br>  <br>  And Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in Me does not believe in Me, but in Him who sent Me. And he who beholds Me beholds the One who sent Me. I have come as light into the world, that everyone who believes in Me may not remain in darkness." (John 12:44-46)<br>  <br>  And so when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments, and reclined at the table again, He said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you? You call Me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for I am. If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet." (John 13:12-14)<br>  <br>  Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him." Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us." Jesus said to him, "Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how do you say, 'Show us the Father'?" (John 14:6-9)|`|4DqtcnEmaa	False, since when has someone known the mind of God that they might be able to instruct Him when God is present in the counsel of the Godly and among the peoples where in His Wisdom HE made one to be one thing and others to be something else with sound divisions with regards to the tower of babel and other things like spirit and soul and personalities?<br>  <br>  To be 'correct' with regards to the outward words of 'drawing near' to God with only ones mouth and to have accepted standing with God are different things; to be sure.  For Abel's faith was accepted, but Cain proved to be a murderer of the first Marytr in allowing his jealousy over God's approval to overpower his love for his brother.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	ever read John 5:17-18?<br>  "Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.” For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, MAKING HIMSELF EQUAL WITH GOD.""|`|oVHFz52Laa	True. You need to have the TRUE Jesus. You do not have the Truth unless you really have the Truth, right Jesus. No matter how your organization is conditioning you to believe that you are the only group who has the Truth, you do not have the Truth unless you really have the Truth, Jesus Christ who is God.<br>  <br>  Remember, Thomas said to Jesus " My Lord, my God".

Why? In Isaiah, God said that the time would come where he himself would walk among his people to heal them and save them.  God also said something about the gentiles( you and I) The day would come where he will call those who he did not love " loved ones" that means Jews and gentiles will be accepted by God.  God also said In Isaiah,  that he would be the savior of man, no prophet, no messenger will he send, he himself will be the savior  because there is no savior but him.|`|f71491a9cdfef6848bb10829d6bb09d5aa	I can not show you texts that say Yhshua/Jesus is equal to his Almighty Father and God YHWH/Jehovah because they truly don’t exist.<br>  I can tell you that there are 4 Scriptures that supporters of the pagan Roman trinity god often use and I can try to clarify those in context with sound reasoning;<br>  <br>  1. John 1:1 in most Bibles reads "in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god" but if you get a book on ancient Koine Greek which John 1:1 was written in, you will see that John used two different words for each "god" in that verse and a more precise translation would be "in the beginning was the word and the word was with the God and the word was in spirit form". John was simply explaining that Yhshua/Jesus existed with YHWH/Jehovah in heaven before the earth was created. Let’s see if anyone else is called by the same Koine Greek title given to Jesus at John 1:1. Let’s look at the word at 2 Corinthians 4:4. It’s the same Koine Greek word in both John 1:1 and 2 Corinthians 4:4! Does that make the one at 2 Corinthians 4:4 part of the trinity also?<br>  <br>  2. Jesus said "I and the Father are one" at John 10:30, then they picked up stones to stone him, but then he explained just six verses later that he is only "God's Son" John 10:36. it's interesting how people who choose the pagan Roman trinity god stop reading before John 10:36! then, to top it all off, Jesus says that his true followers are "one" like he and his Father (John 17:21, 22) making it crystal clear that "one" doesn't mean 'the same person', it means 'in unity'. <br>  <br>  3. then there's John 8:58 which should be read in context. here the Jewish leaders are telling Jesus that Abraham and the prophets are greater than him. Then Jesus clearly says that he can not glorify himself, only the Father can. Then he says that Abraham rejoiced about the Messiah, to which they said 'how can you claim to have seen Abraham when you aren't even 50?' Then Jesus says that he existed before Abraham. <br>  that is a logical answer to the Jews telling him he couldn‘t possibly have seen Abraham. However supporters of the traditional pagan Roman 3-in-1 god say that Jesus uttered God's Holy name in verse 58; how does that make any sense?<br>  which is a more sensible answer to the Jews question of 'you aren’t even 50, how can you have seen Abraham?'<br>  A. I existed before Abraham<br>  or<br>  B. Before Abraham YHWH<br>  it makes no grammatical sense to say he was answering their question with a sentence fragment. <br>  if he were wanting to claim to be YHWH wouldn’t he have said 'I am YHWH' instead of "before Abraham I am"<br>  however it *was* outrageous to the Jews for him to claim that he existed in heaven before Abraham <br>  <br>  4. supporters of the traditional pagan Roman god also use 1 John 5:7 to prove their co-equal 3-in-1 god but 1 John 5:5 says "Jesus is the son of God" and verse 6 in the oldest manuscripts extant states that he came by "water and blood". John, like all Bible writers is inspired by God's holy “spirit” to “bear witness“. Verse 7 only says "the three bear witness", the rest of the stuff in verse 7 in the KJVersions was added in the FIFTH CENTURY! Then in the oldest manuscripts extant verse 8 doesn’t have anything about "and there are three that bear witness in earth", nor does it contain the Greek words for “Father” or “Word” but it uses the same Greek words from verse 6 for "water” and “blood".<br>  All theologic historians know those facts!<br>  <br>  Ask yourself, is there a danger of dishonoring the one whom Jesus calls “the only true God” by trying to make Jesus co-equal to Him; when in actuality “the Father is greater” and deserves all the recognition, worship and submission Jesus himself gave Jehovah?<br>  Perhaps you have an attachment to the 1,700 year old tradition injected into the “christian” doctrine by the pagan Roman empire. You can not be faulted for blindly following a tradition, but you should do a little research into the history of the trinity god and xmas and easter and all the other unscriptural things forced into “christian” doctrine by the Roman government in the 4th century. If you truly love Jesus, you will want to investigate the matter and not just blindly follow “traditions of men“. <br>  Mark 7:6-8 - He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: " 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."<br>  Many so-called “christians” are on the broad road to destruction because not only do they not care about the will of Jehovah, most of them do not even know the name of the one Jesus serves. What will happen to the “many” so-called “christians” on the last day?<br>  Matthew 7:21-23 - "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on tha|`|yDgxAHO9aa	8Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us."<br>  <br>   9Jesus answered: "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 10Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. 11Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves. 12I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. 14You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not trying to prove your wrong, but here's my reply to another question discussing the same topic:<br>  <br>  we always say, trinity in one and one in trinity. We also say the father is not the son is not the holy spirit, and the father is the son is the holy spirit...confusing enough, lol<br>  <br>  We explain it using the example of the sun:<br>  <br>  The sun is one object, but through the sun you get heat, and you get light. You got three things: the sun it self, the heat coming from the sun, and the light of the sun. We could say the heat is not really the sun, and it's not really the light, but at the same time they're all rally the same. Same with God's trinity, he's only one God, but the holy spirit is the spirit that is with us at all times. For example your conscious would blame you for worldly stuff, but gives us the holy spirit to blame us for spiritual stuff. The son is how God talks to us, or the messenger if you will. The father is the main guy, but again all the same.<br>  <br>  At first we pray 'our father' and at the end we say, 'through Christ Jesus our lord'. Jesus is telling us they are the same by adding that part at the end. You can't get to one without the other,<br>  <br>  Now is it disastrous, I don't think it is....why? you might be correct and know every tiny bit about the bible, and be right about it. But with all your knowledge, you might not be following any of it. Another person might believe other things that are not correct, but that person might be following everything he believes. I tell you that other person is doing way better.<br>  <br>  So it doesn't matter how you view God, and whether you're right or wrong, what really matter is that you are truly able to follow what you believe.<br>  <br>  Hope that made sense

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|a86de0fc85e991d8d111b09367571df7aa	It's not just kids, I've seen some of the older types who think the same things.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	The popularity of paranormal movies, tv, literature is pleasurable for those who enjoy reading imaginative tales & appreciate the human capacity for flights of fancy. <br>  <br>  Those who twist it & make it their reality are seriously in need of help. 'Reputable' channels like Discovery running a program on vampires convinces the delusional of this being real. <br>  <br>  The media is feeding minds that don't have the capacity for rational, analytical, cognitive thought. Perhaps parents and schools haven't done their jobs. In any event, these ppl are in need of a therapist and a reality check <br>  <br>  Some quality science classes couldn't hurt, either. Without education, pop culture is pablum gobbled down without discernment.  If these kids make it to an adult life to become teachers/parents, I fear for the following generations. Intellectually & emotionally crippled! We are making progress by leaps & bounds scientifically yet going backwards in some aspects.Ex: some believe physical ailments are caused by 'bad energy' akin to 'demons' of old which were the cause of illness before bacteria & the scientific process was formed.<br>  <br>  A vast percentage of the questioners are young, but I've encountered some ppl in their 40s & up who believe the fantastical, also. They've turned sci-fi into a pseudoscience in which everything is possible (i.e. The Secret). <br>  <br>  In the beginning, it's sad..but as one goes along it gets maddening that these ppl are out in society working jobs & driving on the highway. What happens when they believe 'in magic' & think physics/gravity won't come into effect in a job involving machinery or in a car accident? Sure, they can say this is their 'belief system', but when it affects my reality if you crash into my car-I'm concerned!|`|4maV4O1aaa	Yeah, people, stop drinking jugs of cow's blood - you are deluding yourselves to think that "vampirism" is real - it's FICTION and FOLK TALES!

I am so sick of these, "Vamp-kids" They all look ridicules and i agree they need to get a life.|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	It's a supernatural curse that feeds on the living essence and very being of people... it's called twilight, and is a plague spreading all over the world. It's very existence threatens the free world more so then any terrorist groups, with its mindless dribble and absolute none sense about vampires and werewolves. They can't even get the lore right... i mean... COME ON!!! Vampires and werewolves have nothing to do with each other. That whole vampires vs werewolf crapp is an invention of Hollywood that's only been around for like what? 20 years?... absolute rubbish in my opinion. I like a good story, and mythical elements tend to catch my interest too, but twilight is just trash. period.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just so people know, it is possible for a human to become vampiric... there's no evidence of it, and highly unlikely, but still a genetic possibility (as there are numerous vampiric animals). Essentially though, it would be caused by a genetic defect and they'll need to rely on the consumption of blood for sustenance. Which will actually make them "sub-human", making them physically weaker to the average human in every way. And even if a race of functional human vampires were to arise as a seperate species (which is near impossible), they'd be no stronger/faster/smarter than the average person... just have a different dietary need. And in know way would they have the abilities and weaknesses of a vampire (except for the steak through the heart or decapitation of the head, as that'd kill any person. Vampire or otherwise).|`|30R7gIXtaa	just don't tell me the flying spaghetti monster isn't the Chief Deity of the universe<br>  <br>  <br>  have you noticed more wimpy the kid more they want to be a vampire<br>  <br>  sort of like the spotty , pasty face kids with the black t shirts with megadeath and other supposed hard core bands<br>  <br>  wimps total wimps|`|aQTOAmZcaa	If you dont believe then dont worry about it.<br>  <br>   <br>  People believe in different things.<br>  <br>  You probably believe in god...and no matter what you say, you wont make me believe in him.<br>  <br>  See where im getting at?

We would also disdain the literary transformation of the vampire from awesomely powerful and terrifying entity to emo wretches had 'Twilight' been released when we were still 16 and slicing each other in discreet areas to get some droplets. Real vamps don't advertise - it shortens the lifespan of an immortal creature when you give hunters your IP address. Yes, I tried to read 'Twilight' - key word here is 'try' - I couldn't do it, and I love trash! It was too much even for me.<br>  <br>  I'm just baffled at the intensely low-level intelligence that seems to be displayed by some of these kids - stupid humans do not make good vampires, so they say. If you have to ask whether you are or not, you're probably not. I recall seeing some young girl quoted as saying that Ed Cullen would be the perfect dream date "because of his arresting stare that you can't look away from" - that stare is used to entrance victims, it isn't supposed to be dreamy in the least except for the fact that it makes you forget that the creature staring at you believes you to be food.<br>  <br>  You're a vampire on the internet?

This is my answer.|`|U8Fwh38jaa	You're right in that therapy is sometimes in order.  Sometimes the kid has such a dismal realistic life that they retreat into a fantasy life. What they don't understand is:  just because you say you're a thing (vamp, mermaid, fairy, whatever) doesn't make it so.  But sometimes I think they do believe it so strongly that they've convinced themselves it's fact.  It's a sad thing really.  And there is absolutely no getting thru to them either.  They shut down and don't listen to reason or logic.  It's a waste of time to argue with them or try to make them see reason.  It's frustrating and nerve-wracking and annoying to listen to them or see their questions posted.  But mostly, it's sad.  Because I figure their reality must be pretty bad for them to opt for such a fantasy.

On such occasions parts of the sacrificial animal victim were placed on the idol altar, a portion went to the priests, and a portion went to the worshipers, who would use it for a meal or feast, either in the temple or in a private house. However, some of the flesh that had been offered to the idols was often turned over to the ma′kel·lon, or meat market, to be sold.<br>  <br>  Many persons before becoming Christians had been accustomed to eating meats offered to idols with a feeling of reverence for the idol. (1Co 8:7) In so doing, these former pagans had been sharers with the demon god represented by the idol. (1Co 10:20) Quite fittingly, therefore, by formal letter from Jerusalem, the governing body of the early Christian congregation, under the guidance of the holy spirit, forbade such formal, religious eating of meats offered to idols, thus safeguarding Christians from idolatry in this regard.—Ac 15:19-23, 28,?29.<br>  <br>  Christians, like those living in pagan Corinth, were faced with a number of questions in this matter. Could they conscientiously go into an idol temple and eat meat if they did so with no thought of honoring the idol? And, would there be any objection to buying from the ma′kel·lon meats that had been ceremonially offered to idols? Finally, how should a Christian handle this matter when eating as a guest in someone else’s home?<br>  <br>  Under inspiration Paul provided the Corinthian Christians with timely information to aid them in making the correct decisions. Although “an idol is nothing,” it would not be advisable for a Christian to go to an idol temple to eat meat (even though his eating was not part of a religious ceremony), because he could thereby be giving spiritually weak observers the wrong impression. Such observers might conclude that the Christian was worshiping the idol, and they could be stumbled by this. It could lead such weaker ones to the point of actually eating meats sacrificed to idols in religious ceremony, in direct violation of the decree of the governing body. There was also the danger that the Christian eater would violate his own conscience and yield to idol worship.—1Co 8:1-13.<br>  <br>  Since the ceremonial offering of meats to idols produced no change in the meat, the Christian could, however, with a good conscience buy meat from a market that received some of its meat from religious temples. This meat had lost its “sacred” significance. It was just as good as any other meat, and the Christian was therefore not under obligation to make inquiry respecting its origin.—1Co 10:25,?26.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the Christian, upon being invited to a meal, did not have to make inquiry concerning the source of the meat but could eat it with a good conscience. If, however, an individual present at the meal were to remark that the meat had been “offered in sacrifice,” then the Christian would refrain from eating it to avoid stumbling others.—1Co 10:27-29.<br>  <br>  The words of the glorified Jesus Christ to John respecting the Christian congregations at Pergamum and Thyatira indicate that certain ones had failed to heed the apostolic decree in not keeping themselves clean from things sacrificed to idols.—Re 2:12, 14, 18,?20.<br>  <br>  In my culture, we don't have many meat markets that handle the leftovers from the priests, so it is a null issue.<br>  <br>  The important issue though, is there something that I know I have the "right" to do, would I limit my choose to avoid causing a problem for a fellow believer? Paul showed that he would do such, avoiding eating any meat that might make a fellow Christian who's conscience was still linking that meat to the source it came from.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Sure.

We still don't know enough about DNA and the human brain to say it's definitely genetic or not.<br>  <br>  At the same time, that doesn't mean it doesn't have some biological basis. In psychology, we talk about the nature vs. nurture debate.  The truth is that everything in human behavior is pretty much affected by what's biological (nature) and what we're taught socially (nurture).<br>  <br>  I find it interesting that people want to see it as only being biological or only as a choice.

I do not think it is genetic because it does not lead to the propagation of the species. How could a design that avoids reproduction evolve?<br>  <br>  2. I do not think it is a choice because that would mean that I had, at some time in my life, to choose to be het and not gay. It also would mean that I could wake up one morning and just decide to give boys a try. I never did make a choice to be het, and I never could decide to give gay a try.

Like rabbits changing fur color depending on the temperature.|`|rRGI5Wsvaa	There are currently ongoing scientific research that is being done on this. The scientists say that they are on a major breakthrough and it is VERY probable that it is a gene. It would explain many things, for example, overpopulation. Since there is a food shortage, the environment is horrible etc. Mother nature introduces the gay gene to prevent humans from reproducing. That is one of the theories anyway.<br>  <br>  Another theory is that homosexuality happens in the wound due to an imbalance of chemicals.|`|LXD59ocbaa	"Research suggests that the homosexual orientation is in place very early in the life cycle, possibly even before birth.

But fingerprints aren't genetic either - and you can't choose those.<br>  <br>  Tell us about how you chose between it and heterosexuality, will you?<br>  <br>  <br>  The bible was written in an age where tribe size was of the utmost importance. All sexual energy was directed towards filling women with babies as early and as often as possible; all other sexual behavior was criminalized.<br>  <br>  It was a practical matter, and had nothing to do with morality. In fact, quite the contrary; homosexuality isn't immoral - it hurts nobody. Homophobia hurts and sometimes kills - that's what's immoral.<br>  <br>  Christians can't reconcile the idea of a fair god with those barbaric laws, so they have to pretend that homosexuality is an immoral act (it isn't), a choice (it isn't - if you think it is, can you tell me about when you made the choice?), and unnatural (it's not - it's observed in many animal species).<br>  <br>  You could argue that in today's overpopulated world, heterosexuality should be the 'sin'.<br>  <br>  P.S.

This is not unexpected for a species whose lineage diverged from our own about 25 million years ago. The human and chimp genomes, which diverged just 6 million years ago, are about 98 per cent identical.<br>  <br>  One puzzling discovery is that several mutations that cause genetic diseases in humans - such as phenylketonuria and Sanfilippo syndrome, which lead to mental retardation - are the normal form in macaques and, presumably, our own ancestors.<br>  <br>  But interestingly Apes appear to be evolving faster than humans since the split!!  233 chimp genes, compared with only 154 human ones, have been changed by selection since chimps and humans split from their common ancestor about 6 million years ago!!|`|2zd9OjeMaa	Humans are apes.

Even Thomas Jefferson, who is at the heart of all atheistic argument, went to church every week for he held that the leadership should do what is right in the eyes of God and man. <br>  Correct - he made his own Bible by cutting out all of Jesus' miracles and then prayed every day. <br>  There was no pledge in the beginning - only "In God We Trust" and where does that tell you they all were? <br>  If you don't think this nation was founded on the ideology of Christian Doctrines, you have not read any of the "fathers" papers.

iXI7n6Gmaa	In islam it is taught that every thing (every animal every green every stone) in this universe knows the fact of God's existence except for Humans due to the free choice/will to believe and act accordingly.|`|FvoxgjbJaa	First of all it must be understood that with God all things are possible.<br>   <br>  That is to say that if God wanted to give animals an understanding of Who He is it would be done; but it would only be done as a miracle of grace to demonstrate the foolishness of those men who refuse to hear Him. "He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God."<br>  <br>  However God did not make animals in His image; that is to say that the souls that animate animals were not created to enjoy eternal life after bodily death. <br>  <br>  The souls of humans were created in the image of God; created for an eternal life after bodily death.<br>  <br>  In Scripture we read St. Peter compare those who lack understanding as like unto pigs and dogs: "The dog is returned to his vomit: and, The sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire."<br>  <br>  But even if animals do have limited understanding they do not have wisdom which is a gift from God to men. "Who hath put wisdom in the heart of man or who hath given the cock understanding--Job 38:36."<br>  <br>  Animals are motivated strictly by instinct. They do not fast or abstain in order to subject the lower apetites of their bodily lusts. Men can make decisions to fast and abstain in order to subject their lower apetites; the concupiscence of the eyes.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	If animals did have a concept of god, no one would know anyway because animals would not be able to communicate this coherently to us.|`|nNSoOWQDaa	This is true. Even animals have an awareness of God. In the Bible it says "Let everything that has breath praise the Lord". This would include animals. I know I have read other verses as well about this subject. Animals are one of God's beautiful creations and they are not here for us to abuse and mistreat.|`|jNUo0tKEaa	I believe that not even humans have the choice whether to  believe or not believe in  the higher power. I mean whatevers true is reality. Im sure they have the concept of reality in their minds whatever anyone may call it. Its there. But it could be true.|`|0lpXN8p9aa	Animals are one with Nature, which is God's awareness.

cnnSAkQJaa	Thats the worst idea I ever did hear. Get a job, save some money then you can travel in style. You might actually enjoy the trip then.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	Sounds good.  When you are young and not tied down (ie - relationships!) it is a good time to travel and see the world.  You should be able to pick up a bit of work here and there to keep you going - might want to think about getting yourself some sort of car though, it's better and more reliable than hitch-hiking.|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	Its fine as long as you have money to roam around the country. Please do not hitch hike-its a dangerous world out there!  Going over seas? Well, you'll need money for that big time. How about one trip at a time so you can save up for it?? It good to dream.|`|096429d0b8a1276c6a855e7990dbd550aa	Sure, if you're not murdered while hitch hiking.|`|EKjnMQVhaa	Well, with the econonmy the way it is, it probably isn't a good idea to go skipping around the  county if you don't have a million dollars saved up.  This is not a day and age to depend on other people to help get you by- you have to do it yourself.<br>    But, there are TONS of options out there.   Google 'working in australia"... they are welcome to accepting people to their country to work.  You apply for a visa (not the credit card), and you can go there for up to a year.  best part about it- you're making money and on a vacation at the same time.  if you do something like that, you can experience a place like Australia as both a tourist and a local at the same time, and you'll get a GREAT experience out of it.  Then, once your year is up, see where you are.  <br>    Australia is not the only place you can go.  Try National Parks, or resorts.  Those places are good because they're in vacationy areas and they often provide staff housing because you'd have nowhere else to stay otherwise.  so you get a job and a place to stay all at once, and you get to live in a forest or something.  most people who do stuff like that are all just out of high school or university, so they're all around the same age.  it's so much fun.  I've done it myself a couple of times.<br>    so yeah, the main risk of doing what you're planning to do is getting stuck somewhere with no money.  it's embarrassing, it sucks, it's traumatising, and who knows how you're gonna get out of it?<br>    There's also things like Teaching English overseas.  Its' easy to do, you get paid, and you get a place to live.<br>    Dude, there's TONS of options out there.  You don't need to be totally random about it.<br>    Good luck and have fun!

It is part of their baptismal vows; so Roman Catholics are believers in the true sense of the word.<br>  <br>  Make sure your friend has a worship leaflet so he can follow along, if your church uses these; and make sure he has a hymn book handy so he can join in with the singing if he is so inclined.  Do not introduce him to others as "my Catholic friend" as this might put a lot of people off because of mistaken notions about Roman Catholics and the Roman Catholic Church; but do make sure that your friend is introduced around during your after-worship fellowship time (aka coffee hour).  Ask your friend what his experience was like when you and he have time to talk about it.  Above all, don't try to convert him to your way of thinking or your denomination's way of thinking.  In the spiritual life each person must make his/her own independent judgments and decisions.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	How is he Catholic and an unbeliever?<br>  <br>  He already accepts Jesus as his lord and savior, so I'm sure he'll be able to follow the service.|`|sebhK7r7aa	He's not a non-believer, he too is a Christian.

That's pretty ignorant of you to assume that.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	He's a Catholic, yet you are referring to him as a non-believer. That means your denomination believes Catholics are not Christians. Some of them can be true Christ believing ppl...so at least they would be partial believers, correct? But I digress....<br>  <br>  It's just like inviting anyone else to church. I guess you're protestant, so his experience will be devoid of the ceremony & symbolism typical of Catholic churches. Your pastor will preach a message that will differ from the topic of the day in the Catholic church (all cath. churches have the same verses read on Sunday. it's designated for each week).<br>  He might find that interesting or he might prefer the ritual of his style of worship. <br>  <br>  There's no need for you to be nervous. Have you visited other churches? It helps to know what others believe & their experience of worship-it can enhance your own experience of faith in your 'version' of religion. <br>  <br>  Just pray about it. There's nothing you can control about his experience (or ever, for that matter). His experience is not likely to be dreadful. If he's not particularly thrilled, it's not your fault. It sounds like either your religion or your upbringing have instilled an emphasis on blame. <br>  <br>  Let God do his thing. Maybe the guy will change churches-maybe not. It's the guy's choice. His salvation is up to him & God thru Christ & the Holy Spirit. And on whether he's a non-believer...no one can determine who is & isn't by what church they attend. It's btw the person & God.  <br>  <br>  I'm a Christian who has studied world religions for decades. Even though your denomination may insist they are the only way, there are other belief systems who have believers...whether they are monotheistic, polytheistic, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm not downing you or your beliefs. Just realize that ppl believe many diff things in this world. They don't have to believe exactly like you to be an acceptable human being.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Catholics accept other religions.

Allow this person to see things and experience things through their own eyes and ears.

God does the placing of Christians where He decides He wants them to suit  both, His and their spiritual relationship with one another.

Religious beliefs are a very personal subject and they can be hard to share with others.  I would explain some of the customs that you practice at your church beforehand so that he's not completely lost during service.  Let him ask any questions that he may have and be honest and nonjudgmental with your answers. For example, if you can't quote a verse or something, say that you don't know.  He'll also understand that you don't have to be perfect to go to your church.  Sit somewhere where he feels comfortable, get there on time so you don't have all eyes on you when you come in, don't introduce him to EVERYONE you know, don't make him stand up if they ask visitors to do so.  If there are things that you don't necessarily like or understand about your denomination or church, sharing your thoughts might also help him feel more at ease. Hope some of these tips help.  Have a great time!|`|xhHxhai5aa	If he's open enough to go with you, you shouldn't have to worry about him causing much conflict.  That being said, make sure none of your own congregation are openly aggressive towards HIM.  If you all play nice, it'll hopefully extend his view on Christianity a bit.<br>  <br>  I feel experiencing as many forms of religion is very important.  Because how can you know what's right for you, if you haven't tried it all, ya know?

ridu0Rtwaa	Marijuana potency has grown steeply over the past decade with serious implications for users with the average amount of THC having more than doubled.<br>  <br>  In the same period the number of admissions to psychiatric hospital caused by the drug soared by 85 per cent due to the fact that those who smoke the drug regularly are more than twice as likely to suffer illnesses such as schizophrenia, hallucinations and delusions later in life.<br>  <br>  Teens using marijuana to alleviate feelings of depression just compound the problem.<br>  <br>  As well as psychotic illness cannabis can cause affective disorders such as depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.  Even worse it is linked to cancers.<br>  <br>  Cannabis users display neuropsychological dysfunction (relative frontal lobe functioning deficits, cognitive inhibition) and attentional deficits similar to those found in schizotypal or schizophrenia patients. <br>  <br>  Regular use can shrink the parts of the brain which control memory, emotion and aggression. The hippocampus, which is thought to govern emotion and memory averages 12 percent smaller and the amygdala, which has a part in controlling fear and aggression, 7 percent  smaller.  This suggests that heavy daily use may be toxic to human brain tissue.<br>  <br>  Blood flow velocity is significantly higher in users and they have higher values on the pulsatility index (PI), which measures the amount of resistance to blood flow. This is thought to be due to narrowing of the blood vessels that occurs when the circulation system's ability to regulate itself is impaired.  This leads to abnormalities in the small blood vessels in the brain.<br>  <br>  The active chemical in MJ called delta-9-tetrahyrdocannabinol (THC) binds to cannabinoid (CB) receptors located on several cell types in various organs.  This greatly increases the risk for heart attacks and strokes in addition to impaired learning and memory.<br>  <br>  It can also effect physical health.  Three to four cannabis cigarettes a day cause the same amount of damage to the lungs as 20 or more tobacco cigarettes a day. Thus there are rising levels of lung diseases such as emphysema.<br>  In comparison to cigarettes marijuana smoke has significantly higher levels of toxic compounds, including ammonia and hydrogen cyanide.    Ammonia levels are 20 times higher while hydrogen cyanide, nitric oxide and certain aromatic amines occurred at levels 3-5 times higher.<br>  It can also effect the unborn child. Scientists have identified that endogenous cannabinoids, molecules naturally produced by our brains are functionally similar to THC from cannabis and play significant roles in establishing how certain nerve cells connect to each other.  Maternal cannabis use allows THC to travel through the placenta and impair fetal brain development and impose life-long cognitive, social, and motor deficits in affected offspring.<br>  <br>  Low doses of ?-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), equivalent to that in the bloodstream of an average marijuana smoker facilitate infection of skin cells and can cause these cells to turn into malignant sarcoma.  Men who regularly smoke cannabis have a 70 per cent increased risk of testicular cancer.<br>  <br>  <br>  And then there are all the car crashes caused by people driving under the influence of drugs that are at this moment being quantified but already show that more drug drivers kill than drink drivers!!|`|UJtUpWO0aa	You don't have a "God" problem!

Like what: praying? <br>  <br>  If more people would obey the Word of God then we wouldn't have so many problems.<br>  <br>  Churches receive no money from the government. Almost all things that support atheism, like evolution, get millions and millions of dollars from the government every year.<br>  <br>  Your question reminded me of a quote: "Religion is the opiate of the masses." The same one who said that said things like: "Gratitude is a disease of dogs." and "It is better for a thousand innocent men to die than to let one guilty man go free."

uQJnkwFVaa	Well, it's sad to see that this is a big reality in the world we live in because most people who aren't Christians tend to follow those who call themselves Christians and unfortunately if those who call themselves Christians and live a double life are the ones being followed then a lot of people in this world are getting a wrong impression of a Christian life and by this, they are losing the chance of being saved. That is why it is important for us Christians to live in integrity because others are going to watch us to see how we express, what we do, what we say, etc, to see if we are real Christians. So please Christians, watch your everyday way of living because it's not only your salvation that depends it's also the others. <br>  P.S.

As I got older, I started wondering why some people think/act a certain way so I'd learn about it.<br>  <br>  It's taken me pretty far. I can argue for a belief just as easily as I can argue against it. I guess the only downside, which I sometimes find comical, are the judgments against me.

RxiBpUUuaa	Here you go; <br>  recruitment for the military begins in movie theatres, during the previews, on television during public service announcements, continues with calling high school students offering enticements to enlist. Once the training has begun, the ready for action military must march.<br>  Military is a very big business. It is tied into manufacturing, science, communications, petroleum industry, and so many others. I know of no way to end that spiral of money for rope.<br>  <br>  One thing is for certain. There are always differences between peoples. Some talk things over and reach a settlement, like the courts mediate divorce. Some talk and escalate to violence, like nothing matters but the thrill, the kill. Generations have died in wars, whole cultures have been taken from this place as if never existed. And yet it becomes more crowded, six billion and climbing. When people resist the urge to procreate as if there were still frontiers to settle, maybe we can develop a means of stabilized exchange where profits are not derived from the poor and delivered to the wealthy. Then, we can be stewards of eden.<br>  <br>  edit; I believe that we actually can do something. For one generation, self restraint from having children would dslow the population boom enough to take steps to remediate the problems related to resource pressure. Oil, farming, military. People will have a chance again. Might be a best case scenario, every other generation skips the children part. Making children are not a constitutional right. Lottery style, winners can have just one. Remember the fable where the king's daughter entered her name in the lottery, and won? She believed that self sacrifice was key to the success of the group.|`|2Ypig4jBaa	Presently there is not much war being actively fought inside of the planet.

However the one drop rule is not legal or in use anymore though many stupid people like to think it is.

Pknb2ihOaa	I believe that when you die, you go on to become either closer to God if you lead a good life, but further if you lead a bad one, and that you keep on progressing until you're as close to God as you can be. I also believe those who you form bonds with stay with you, or stay in contact with you in some way, although they are not bound by where you are in relation to God.|`|cYwmT9xPaa	Hi, when you die you do not go to heaven or hell. You are basically in an unconscious sleep waiting for the return of Christ. When he does return you will either be resurrected THEN on the first resurrection and go with God into heaven or you will be raised the 2nd resurrection which will be when God comes a 3rd time with His kingdom and saints.<br>  When you read about the spirit returning to God it is in regard to the breath of life, you have to study more on this subject to better understand but here are some verses that could help you and some websites<br>  <br>  When a person dies<br>  "The dust will return to the earth as it was and the spirit will return to God who gave it" (Ecclesiastes 12:7)<br>  <br>  What is the spirit<br>  "The body without the spirit is dead" (Jeremiah 2:26) "The spirit of God is in my nostrils" (Job 27:3)<br>  <br>  Spirit= Breath of life, nowhere in the bible does it say it thinks, has wisdom or feeling after a person is dead.<br>  <br>  What’s a Soul?<br>  "And the Lord God formed a man of the dust of the ground, and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living sole" (Genesis 2:7)<br>  <br>  Soul=Living Being <br>  Body+Breath=A Soul (Soul cant exist without both)<br>  <br>  Souls Die<br>  "The soul that sins shall die" (Ezekiel 18:20)<br>  <br>  If souls do not die then that mean we are immortal which is wrong only God is immortal (1 Timothy 6:15,16) Saying that a soul doesn’t die is going against the bible.<br>  <br>  They Know nothing:<br>  "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten." "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest." (Ecclesiastes 9:6,10)<br>  <br>  They Cant communicate:<br>  "So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."

Even the dogs came and licked his sores. <br>   22"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23In hell,[Hades] where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' <br>  <br>   25"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.' <br>  <br>   27"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, 28for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' <br>  <br>   29"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' <br>  <br>   30" 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' <br>  <br>   31"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.' "<br>  <br>  Luke 16:19-31<br>  <br>  Now I believe things have changed since Jesus died and descended in Hades. He ransomed those held there because of their sin debt and took them with Him into heaven when He ascended.<br>  Now everyone who dies in faith, trusting in the salvation offered by Jesus Christ goes directly to heaven. <br>  That is why Paul said:<br>  "Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. We live by faith, not by sight. We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord."<br>  II Corinthians 5:6-8<br>  <br>  Those who die in their sins still go to the same place the rich man went, awaiting the final judgemnt of God.<br>  <br>  Read what happened to this man:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.near-death.com/storm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.near-death.com/storm.html</a>|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I don't believe you have a soul.

Then I looked up Harry Reid and found out he is actually pretty conservative, like he is against gay marriage, against abortion, etc. The only thing liberal about him was he was against making English the official language of the federal government and is for amnesty for illegal aliens and seems to want a larger government.<br>  <br>  Either way as long as he doesn't go against what the church teaches, his politics aren't an issue. I guess if he was saying something that contradicts what the church teaches(such as being against abortion) his membership could be in jeopardy.<br>  <br>  There is 1 or 2 more Mormons who are Democrats and they are pretty conservative as well|`|FyLfEPv0aa	He's also dedicated to many principals that the LDS church takes stances on that Dems usually don't.

af5ac2fa6b3b5305fd2c579e2461224faa	Idea22 si è già risposto a questa domanda...<br>  La Chiesa ha ricevuto molte richieste dai fedeli per avere la messa in latino, già quando c'era GPII. BXVI ha approvato quello che stava facendo il suo predecessore. La messa rimarrà in lingua locale ad eccezione di alcune occasioni in cui i fedeli faranno specifica richiesta del latino.TV e giornalisti come al solito fanno le loro belle controinformazioni anticattoliche.<br>  <br>  Perchè invece di rispondere a caso non vi informate? Possibile che vi beviate tutto quello che dice la TV e qualche partecipante di Answers?<br>  Il vantaggio di una messa in latino <br>  <br>  (per chi ne fa richiesta e non tutte le messe di tutti i giorni in tutto il mondo)<br>  è di avere più fervore e avvicinamento alle prime comunità latine cattoliche. Il latino è la lingua ufficiale della Chiesa che annovera 1,5 miliardi di fedeli. Non è una lingua morta come dicono i media. La scienza, ad esempio, la usa ancora per catalogare fauna, flora e funghi. Si usa per studiare i classici della letteratura ai licei e in medicina.<br>  Ciao.<br>  <br>  PS<br>  BXVI non ha fatto alcuna gaffe. Sono i massmedia che hanno travisato la realtà e i musulmani ci sono andati a nozze. Rileggetevi il discorso di Ratisbona.|`|75597c2361474fcf8094ec35ed0a34acaa	Secondo me non ha proprio senso. Con la messa in latino invece di avvicinare, allontana i giovani dalla Chiesa. Inoltre mi immagino le vecchiette quanto ne possano capire delle parole dette in latino... Comunque il Papa l'ha fatto per riavvicinare il movimento dei lefebvriani che era stato scomunicato. Era un movimento nato da Monsignor Lefebvre che fu contro il Concilio Vaticano II e in particolare a tutti i nuovi cambiamenti apportati tra cui appunto la messa celebrata con le lingue nazionali. Visto che all'epoca del concilio anche Ratzinger non era favorevole al cambiamento... Ciao|`|641beae60688099041011b6babec9db6aa	Immagino le difficoltà dei giovani che non hanno studiato il latino a scuola e lo paragono, come problema, a quello dei nostri vecchi contadini che con Fede andavano alla S. Messa e pregavano in un latino approssimativo e forse senza capire <br>  un'acca.<br>  Quest'anno mi sono trovato in Bosnia-Erzegovina ed ho assistito a diverse cerimonie religiose. Sinceramente ascoltare in italiano mi aiutava molto, ma ero in difficoltà col croato e il tedesco che non conosco. Mi difendevo con il francese, l'inglese e il latino, quest'ultimo studiato a scuola. Quando il Papa di allora decise di far dire la Messa nelle lingue nazionali non abolì affatto l'uso del latino e questo Papa, da quello che ho inteso, ha ribadito lo stesso concetto, cioè che la Messa può esser detta "anche in latino", quindi l'idea papale non è affatto impositiva e non cambia nessuna regola.|`|21a3590194806a3ba95fbaadaab95b4faa	Davvero vuole ripristinare la messa in latino? Mha questa non l'aveva proprio sentita...è il colmo!! La messa in latino!! andiamo di male in peggio!<br>  Comunque forse una spiegazione c'è...se la messa è il latino il 90% delle persone che la segue non capisce un accidenti delle cavolate che dicono in chiesa quindi non troverebbe nulla in contrario in quello che dicono. D'altro canto prenderebbero per buono tutto quello che dicono solo perchè lo dice la chiesa e così la massa di gente che non pensa con la propria testa aumenterebbe...insomma torneremo nel medioevo dove tutti sottostavano al potere della chiesa.|`|65db43d9520a3ffc1624592a5b2b5c64aa	Sai gli spropositi poi, tipo: "dormi in aria" e "morti insorti". <br>  Da piccolo mi divertivo un mondo ascoltare le mie zie "ripetere" il Rosario in latino. Ci sarà da divertirsi a Messa.|`|7f3ea27e29daa0785e1b94d20105aa2eaa	Non vuole ripristinare la Messa in latino, vogliono solo ripristinare la possibilità di celebrarla ovunque in latino: così chi la vuole in latino potrà sentirla in latino, ma ci sarà comunque quella nella lingua del paese. (sono i giornalisti che scrivono nei titoli che sarà ripristinata in latino, così la gente acquista più copie... se leggi gli articoli capisci che non sarà solo in latino).|`|d4758f040aa28ca6ce0186193a9a65faaa	Non c'è lingua che tenghi se una persona creda veramente.

Meglio una lingua comune che in seno alla chiesa è nota a tutti. <br>  Non è un eccesso di conservatorismo, semmai un'azione che concede maggiore libertà di espressione. <br>  <br>  La ragione è questa insieme al fatto che il Papa ha voluto fare un gesto significativo di distensione nei confronti della comunità di Monsignor Levebre da sempre in contrasto con la Chiesa anche per questo divieto di dire la messa in latino. <br>  <br>  Concludo dicendo che se un fedele si allontana dalla Chiesa per una questione di questo tipo, così secondaria, non è così importante, significa soltanto che non aveva poi una così gran fede. Potrà essere persino un uomo migliore fuori dalla Chiesa.|`|8febd65fc6d6513f4c53c494177d6ff2aa	Perchè secondo me questo Papa è un conservatore pensa anche alle scomuniche e la messa in latino mi fa pensare al medioevo quando solo i ricchi potevano entrare in chiesa e quando le panche avevano persino il nome stampato della famiglia di un certo ceto sociale, ancora oggi ne vedo, non le hanno mica tolte,  quindi oggi se la messa viene recitata in latino andranno solo le persone di cultura gli altri che non sanno il latino ne possono fare a meno. Ah! Papa Giovanni Paolo II pensaci tu.<br>  Grazie in anticipo per i pollici in giù ciao a tutti.|`|9170528632b4f2a55e66671919dd2cbaaa	Perchè parlate e date risposte su argomenti che non conoscete?

Questa posizione è solitamente assunta rispetto al problema della conoscenza di Dio: dove il fedele è decisamente convinto dell'esistenza di Dio e l'ateo altrettanto decisamente nega questa esistenza, poiché i loro rispettivi ragionamenti paiono loro sufficienti per trarre una conclusione, l'agnostico sospende il proprio giudizio poiché non ritiene di avere (o che possano esistere) mezzi sufficienti di elaborazione concettuale né prove per potersi esprimere in un senso piuttosto che nell'altro.<br>  LAICO: Il termine ha originalmente un uso esclusivamente religioso, riferendosi ai fedeli di una religione viene usato per indicare chi non è appartenente al clero, l'insieme dei fedeli laici è detto laicato.Attualmente è usato spesso per indicare una persona che si ispira ai valori del laicismo o che si ritiene propugnatrice della laicità dello stato; "laico" è usato in opposizione a clericale (questo ultimo termine ha un significato spregiativo).

[katharòi], ? puri ?), detti anche albigesi (dal nome della loro roccaforte, Albi, uno dei luoghi storici dell'Occitània, in Francia), dettero vita ad un movimento ereticale diffuso in Europa tra il XII e il XIV secolo.<br>  I catari o albigesi propugnavano un'eresia gnostica e dualista che, ammirata persino da san Bernardo di Chiaravalle, aveva teorie ritenute pericolose dalla Chiesa di Roma.<br>  Essi credevano nella gnosi (conoscenza) diretta del divino, senza la mediazione dei prelati, considerati invece indegni a causa del potere temporale che rappresentavano; rifiutando in toto i beni materiali e tutte le espressioni della carne, erano sospettati di praticare il controllo delle nascite e l'aborto, credevano nella reincarnazione e professavano la credenza che il re d'amore (Dio) ed il re del male (Rex mundi) rivaleggiassero a pari dignità per il dominio delle anime umane.<br>  Gli albigesi credevano, infatti, che l'intera vita umana fosse segnata dalla lotta tra il principio divino del bene, identificato con il Cristo e con il Dio del Nuovo Testamento, e la divinità del male, delle tenebre e della materia, identificata con Satana e con il Dio dell'Antico Testamento.<br>  Gli albigesi avevano adottato la dottrina dualistica manichea che sosteneva l'esistenza indipendente di un Dio del bene accanto a un Dio del male. Erano noti in Europa occidentale con il nome di catari (puri), ma chiamavano se stessi con l'appellativo di "Uomini buoni". Gli adepti del dualismo si diffusero verso la fine dell'XI secolo nella Francia settentrionale, ma in quanto eretici furono perseguitati e costretti a emigrare verso sud, favorevolmente accolti nella provincia semindipendente della Linguadoca e nella città di Albi, ove stabilirono una loro Chiesa, oltre alle sedi di Carcassonne e Tolosa; quest'ultima si fece promotrice anche di un importante Concilio cataro, a Saint-Félix de Lauragais.<br>  L'intera realtà materiale era considerata un principio negativo, mentre l'anima era concepita come elemento spirituale imprigionato da Satana nel corpo dell'uomo. La sola speranza di salvezza era riposta nella vita dopo la morte, che liberava dalla schiavitù della materia e evitava la reincarnazione nel corpo di un altro essere umano o addirittura di un animale.<br>  [ Prassi<br>  La stessa convinzione che tutto il mondo materiale fosse opera del male esitava, inevitabilmente, nel rifiuto del battesimo d'acqua, dell'Eucarestia, ma anche del matrimonio, suggello dell'unione carnale, genitrice dei corpi materiali - prigione dell'anima. Allo stesso modo era rifiutato ogni alimento originato da un atto sessuale (carni, latte, uova), ad eccezione del pesce, di cui in epoca medievale non era ancora conosciuta la riproduzione sessuale.<br>  Pur convinti della divinità di Cristo, gli albigesi sostenevano che egli fosse apparso sulla Terra come un angelo di sembianze umane (di natura angelica era considerata anche Maria) e accusavano la Chiesa Cattolica di essere al servizio di Satana, perché corrotta e attaccata ai beni materiali.<br>  [Struttura e aspetti liturgici<br>  Le comunità di fedeli erano divise in "credenti", che si chiamavano ? Buoni Uomini ?, ? Buone Donne ? o ? Buoni Cristiani ? e quelli che per l'Inquisizione erano i "perfetti". Questi praticavano forme estreme di ascetismo, rinunciando a ogni proprietà e vivendo unicamente di elemosina. Solo i perfetti potevano rivolgersi a Dio con la preghiera, mentre i semplici credenti potevano sperare di divenire perfetti con un lungo cammino di iniziazione, seguito dalla comunicazione dello Spirito Santo, il Consolamentum, mediante l'imposizione delle mani. Questo era uno dei pochi Sacramenti catari, tra cui una sorta di confessione collettiva periodica.<br>  Tra i perfetti esisteva comunque una gerarchia facente capo ai vari vescovi di ogni Provincia (assistiti da coloro che venivano detti il "Figlio Maggiore" e il "Figlio Minore") e ai vari diaconi delle comunità catare.<br>  La Chiesa Copta fu fondata in Egitto nel I secolo d.C.. Il nome deriva dalla parola greca aigyptios (egizio), trasformata dapprima in gipt e poi in qibt. La Chiesa Copta ha origine dalle prediche di san Marco, discepolo, che scrisse il suo Vangelo nel primo secolo d.C. e portò il cristianesimo in Egitto, al tempo dell'imperatore Nerone. è una delle chiese d'oriente. La liturgia è simile a quella ortodossa, ma le due liturgie si sono evolute differentemente anche perché quella ortodossa è stata influenzata dal ruolo del patriarcato di Costantinopoli, mentre quella copta dal ruolo del patriarcato di Alessandria. La Chiesa Copta vanta, infatti, di aver mantenuto le credenze e la dottrina del cristianesimo più antico, tramandandole di generazione in generazione, senza cambiamenti radicali e rimanendo conforme alla dottrina e ai riti apostolici.<br>  I primi monaci copti vissero in Egitto durante il IV secolo, molti di loro morirono come martiri. Durante il IV e V secolo si ebbe lo scisma della Chiesa Copta dalla Chiesa ortodossa. All'epoca, cioè prima dello Scisma d'Oriente del 1054, per Chiesa ortodossa si intendeva le attuali Chiese cattolica ed ortodossa insieme. Il IV ed il V secolo furono caratterizzati dalle c.d. "eresie cristologiche". I cristiani, cioè, si divisero circa la natura di Cristo. I monofisiti, come la Chiesa copta e quella armena, pur non negando che Gesù fosse sia Dio che uomo, non potevano accettare che un Dio soffrisse in croce, e accentuavano, quindi, la natura "divina" di Cristo. Gli ariani accentuavano la natura "umana", i nestoriani, consideravano Cristo sia uomo che Dio, ma la non contemporaneità di tali nature.<br>  La Chiesa riunita nel Concilio di Calcedonia affermò che Cristo era, al tempo stesso, completamente Dio e completamente uomo. Ciò provocò lo scisma dei monofisiti e nestoriani, che si separano dal resto della Chiesa. Va, comunque, precisato che nel caso di nestoriani e monofisiti le differenze nascevano, oltre che da motivazioni teologiche, comunque esistenti, da questioni politiche e sociali.<br>  La Chiesa copta è stata una delle Chiese a soffrire di più dell'avanzata araba nel Nord Africa. Nonostante la legislazione islamica permettesse alle "religioni del Libro", cioè cristiani, ebrei e zoroastriani, di professare la propria fede, in qualità di dhimmi, impediva le conversioni dall'Islam al cristianesimo, o il matrimonio di donne musulmane con cristiani. I musulmani arrivarono, sotto il califfato degli Ommiadi (661-750), ad imporre la marchiatura a fuoco delle mani dei copti oppure, dinastia Abbasside (750-868), l'obbligo di portare croci pesanti (2 kg.) intorno al collo. Solamente con la dinastia Fatimide (969-1171) i copti poterono liberamente esercitare la loro fede, ma in seguito, la situazione peggiorò per le persecuzioni sotto i Mamelucchi e i Turchi. Risultato di queste persecuzioni è stato il calo del numero dei vescovi, dai 168 del VI secolo ai 17 del XVII secolo. Il periodo buio finì con l'avvento al potere di Mehemet Ali nel 1804 e con i protettorati inglese e francese.<br>   La Chiesa Copta oggi<br>   Diffusione<br>  Si stima che i copti siano circa 10 milioni. La maggioranza vive in Egitto, Etiopia ed Eritrea.<br>  Esistono altre comunità copte in Europa, Australia e America, in particolare negli Usa con circa 200.000 fedeli.<br>   Il Papa<br>  La Chiesa Copta ha il proprio papa, attualmente Shenuda III, che vive a Il Cairo ed è il patriarca numero 117 dalla predicazione di San Marco. A differenza della Chiesa cattolica i copti non attribuiscono al loro papa l'infallibilità papale.<br>  [Caratteristiche peculiari<br>  Il Natale è celebrato il 7 gennaio invece del 25 dicembre.<br>  Il simbolo della croce cristiana fu impiegato originariamente ad Alessandria d'Egitto, tra i cristiani copti.<br>  [Rapporti con il mondo islamico<br>  Durante gli ultimi anni si sono anche verificati episodi di violenza tra la comunità copta e quella musulmana. Infatti, con l'aumento dell'attività dei fondamentalisti islamici dalla fine degli anni '70 le condizioni di vita dei copti in Egitto sono peggiorate. Tra il 1981 e il 1985 il papa Shenuda III fu tenuto agli arresti domiciliari in un monastero nel deserto.<br>  In Etiopia<br>  La Chiesa d'Etiopia, nel 640, fu assorbita da quella Copta egiziana e questa dipendenza è rimasta fino al 1948. A causa delle minacce di invasioni musulmane, nel XVII secolo ci fu l'unione con la Chiesa cattolica, che durò solo undici anni (1621-1632). L'imperatore Hailé Selassié riorganizzò la Chiesa di Etiopia, affrancandola dalla Chiesa Copta egiziana nel 1948 e facendola diventare Chiesa di Stato nel 1955. La Chiesa, con una forte componente monastica, mantiene alcune usanze di chiara influenza ebraica, come la circoncisione, la festività settimanale di sabato, la suddivisione delle carni in pure ed impure.|`|866a46e62ddf9c26732be873ef09e2f0aa	No, la chiesa li ha sterminati ben bene, si racconta che quando arrivarono alla cittadina dove si raccoglievano, circa 30000 persone, il capitano dei soldati aveva mandato un messo al Papa - Ma come faremo a distinguere gli Albigesi dai Cattolici? -<br>  Il Papa rispose. - Ammazzate tutti, Dio distinguerà i suoi. -<br>  Fra eccidi e roghi gli hanno fatto passare la voglia di essere eretici.

aYVVwjBXaa	yes but before the white man came over and took the land from the natives north america was just one giant continent undivided and unnamed. so there was NO CANADA for them to be canadians in. natives are no more "real" canadians then the white ones who were born here or the black ones who came last year.|`|ohj5sRpsaa	What?<br>  <br>  To be Canadian is to be loved by most countries around the world, and to be perceived as the peacemakers - no mater what race we all share the same passport.|`|X1ImlRSlaa	What's a canadian?|`|FnE7BiYJaa	Hmmm, As Canada did not exist then, A Canadian is a citizen of Canada. The first peoples, the First Nations/Aboriginals/Native-Americans are just that, not Canadians, US citizens etc. That would imply being subsumed to a conquering people.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	The real Canadian has this great country in his heart. The early settlers were welcome and had treaties with many bands and intermarried to become the adopted children of the land and people. It has since gotten out of hand. My early relatives came with Champlain and it is a well known fact that we would have starved and froze most certainly to death without our native brothers and sisters. The peoples are finally being seen for themselves and we all welcome the future together, just ask the great mother spirit and she will tell you of these things.
g4lLX3iaaa	Yes,Scotland can do without the monarchy,any country can,England too but,would it work as well?I don't think so.<br>  Scotland can do without England and for a short time,would work adequately.It would then go steadily down hill.At the moment,Scottish welfare is heavily subsidized  by England.The welfare system in Scotland is far better than in the rest of the country but they don't pay for it,Britain as a whole does.|`|ks9I8eFtaa	They could yes, but they'd lose a vital part of their heritage. It would help if the royals would stop treating Scotland like a holiday place and actually live there a bit more, why the queen can't spend more than one week a year at Holyrood confuses me. Balmoral isn't the same because yes, they're in Scotland, but middle of no where Scotland, they should spend more time in Edinburgh in my opinion.|`|dPYotwUxaa	Scotland needs the money and military support of the rest of the UK, Scotish independance is a joke. <br>  We all need each other, even Ireland is worse off without us.

6460883e2266cdadff692fb2332199beaa	does it really matter? <br>  <br>  i think the importance should be placed rather on how you feel about either: "faith" or "auto-suggestion"... and if either helps you in any way.|`|AA11116604	To suggest an idea, is like planting a seed. It may grow and take root or just die.<br>  <br>  Faith is the seed and it not any different than auto-suggesting|`|0101eb23399738fea6cb3034ddfa4659aa	Faith is trust. If you have defined faith differently you would want to redefine it to its to meaning. As trust it is  a choice you make in regards to the believability of the evidence before you in making that choice. As an example lets say you need gas for your car. Evidence that an establishment has gas is that they advertise fuel at $3.00 per gallon, that they have fuel pumps with hoses to make it easy to get fuel from their inground tanks to the fuel tank of your car, They want your money. All of this leads you to believe that you can indeed get fuel at such an establishment so you pull in. That is an act of Faith. The idea of faith being an act that can be said to be done blindly of any evidence instilling trust is a myth. We trust because we see where the evidence leads and so we put that trust in action. That and nothing more or less is Faith. Any preacher or professing christian that tries to tell you otherwise is whooped around by every wind and doctrine that comes along. Like name it and claim it and you can be rich, or healed or whatever. Auto suggestion?  You gotta be kidding?|`|AA11289514	what new fangled invented garbage word in auto-suggestion?|`|AA11469747	Faith is very different from auto-suggestion. I'd like to believe many things, I can suggest to myself those things are good etc. I could become delusional in self belief. The point of faith is self denial in many ways. Faith is a living breathing words fail conviction and belief that goes beyond any suggestion no matter how wished or proded for.|`|AA12156048	normally when you have faith in something its because you believe it through proof,because it worked in the past ,but with respect ,when it comes to religion ,brain washing is the root of this faith not auto suggestion|`|c7d62bb5c7518d3bf6295f37acce3f4baa	There are different types of faith.  The type of faith that you are thinking of, many liberation theologians, call "bad faith".  This is simple regurgitation of what you were told.  "good faith" or true faith is a procees of questioning and seeking what is true or right for you.  Faith is an entirely personal relationship with G*D.  If it is faith there should be nothing "auto" about it.

uuQrhnJ4aa	Cameras capture anything that is visible in the light spectrum That is why if one has an infrared lens it would see things the human eye couldn't see. (This is also why animals see things humans can't. Their ratio of rods/cones in their eyes is different.)<br>  <br>  The only difference is the vid cam is operating for an extended period of time and more likely to capture something you didn't see (like an orb or shadow). With a still cam, simply point it in various directions & shoot. 99% odds you won't see anything while you're doing this, but sometimes things show up on film. <br>  <br>  As for 'seeing' a ghost in a cemetery. I spent years day & night in a cemetary (not for ghost hunting purposes) and never saw a thing!|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	You can catch ghosts, but don't cross the streams!|`|ZRS6V6Rcaa	<a href="http://www.worldiv.com/pixs/retard-owls.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldiv.com/pixs/retard-owls....</a>|`|NgAaenfuaa	uhm thats weird. but if your into supernatural things then i guess go. nothing will probably happen tho.|`|ffAwH6Seaa	No , and dont bother , you wont see anything .|`|6BqcXS4maa	If a ghost wants to make themselves known they will show themselves.

Catching a ghost on a camera is pretty hard.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	No but he can catch you! If he is seen then what, he may resent that and try to make it right. Let the dead lie in peace and never disturb their sleep as that is what gives them peace.

mP6ox5f3aa	They brought the Germanic Blood line into our Royal Family. Acceptable until the idiot Kaiser in 1914. Our Royal Family have had a lot to put up with since then and of course have changed their name to Windsor. Are well, what's in a name? Actually the Royal Family are fine although people think that they don't have a problem when in fact their lives are full of problems. Try shopping in Marks and Sparks if you are a Royal? They have no freedom whatsoever. The Princes trust is tremendous and the Duke of Edinburgh's award has seen a lot of youngsters put on a constructive path of life. Incidentally  the Royal Yacht Britannia was a great way of sending a little bit of Britain abroad with beautiful English ceramics and other 'made in England' articles. It was an act of great stupidity to decommission it. It produced no measurable savings at all.Foreign dignitaries were invited aboard to see a non political Queen and they loved it.<br>  The Queen is very knowledgeable and PM,s apparently are not averse to discussing things with her. Many Charities are glad to have Royal Patronage.<br>  Incidentally it appears that the Royal Family cost well under one pound per head per year.   A President would be just as costly plus the eternal Pensions that each one would have.<br>  A President is also of course Political which means that more than half the Voting public would not want him.|`|qXQIHCqGaa	Not over 9000.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	absolue power, anything they wanted on and off<br>  <br>  jamesii dissolved parliament in his rein, long before 18th centuerybut t was done on and off

My mom is a psychologist, and people always think it's weird that a shrink could have a gay daughter, but there you go.

The First indicates some of the subtle wonders of Paradise. However, it does not prove the existence of Paradise, since this has been proved in most brilliant fashion with the twelve decisive Truths in the Tenth Word and with the most firm and clear consecutive arguments in Arabic which form the basis and summary of the Tenth Word and form the Second Station of this Word. This Station rather discusses a number of the aspects of Paradise which have been the cause of criticism, and of question and answer. If Divine assistance is forthcoming, a great Word will later be written about that mighty truth. God willing.]<br>  <br>  In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.<br>  <br>  And give glad tidings to those who believe and act righteously that their's shall be gardens beneath which flow rivers. Everytime they are fed with fruits therefrom, they will say: " Why, this is what we were fed with before." For they will be given things in similitude. And they shall have therein spouses pure, and shall abide there for ever.<br>  <br>  The brief answers to a number of questions about eternal Paradise.<br>  <br>  The descriptions of the verses of the Qur'an about Paradise, which are more beautiful than Paradise, more lovely than the Houris, and sweeter than the water of Selsebil, leave nothing to be said about it so that anyone should say it. However, in order to bring closer to the understanding those shining, pre-eternal, post-eternal, elevated and exquisite verses, we shall mention a number of steps, and, as samples of that Qur'anic Paradise, a number of fine points which are like samples of its flowers. We shall point to these through five allusive questions and answers. Indeed, Paradise is the means to all spiritual and non-physical pleasures, and so too it is the means to all physical pleasures.<br>  <br>  QUESTION: What connection with eternity and Paradise has faulty, deficient, changing, unstable, and suffering corporeality? Since the spirit has elevated pleasures, that is sufficient. Why is bodily resurrection necessary for bodily pleasures?<br>  <br>  THE ANSWER: Because, just as in relation to water, air, and light, earth is dense and dark, but since it is the source and means of all the varieties of Divine artefacts, in meaning it rises above the other elements, and just as in regard to the mystery of its comprehensiveness and on condition it is purified, the human soul, which is also dense, rises above all the other human subtle faculties, so too corporeality is the richest and most comprehensive and all-embracing mirror to the manifestation of the Divine Names. All the tools and instruments for measuring the contents of the treasuries of Mercy and reckoning their balance are in corporeality. For example, if the sense of taste in the tongue was not the source for scales to the number of the sorts of foods and their pleasures, it could not experience each and recognize them, and taste and measure them. Also, the instruments for experiencing and knowing the manifestations of most of the Divine Names, and tasting and recognizing them, are again in corporeality. And the faculties for experiencing the most various and infinitely different pleasures are also in corporeality.<br>  <br>  Since, as is proved in the Eleventh Word, it is understood clearly from the disposition of the universe and man's comprehensiveness that the universe's Maker wants to make known all the treasuries of His Mercy, and all the manifestations of His Names, and to make experienced all the varieties of His bounties, for sure, the abode of bliss, which is a mighty pool formed from the flood of the universe and a great exhibition of the textiles woven on the loom of the universe and an everlasting store of the crops produced in the arable field of this world, will resemble the universe to a degree. And it will preserve all its fundaments, both corporeal and spiritual. And its All-Wise Maker, the Most Compassionate One, will give as recompense for the duties of the physical tools and instruments, pleasures worthy of them; and to His servants, as a wage and as a reward for the particular worship of each. Otherwise a situation would occur that was contrary to His wisdom, justice, and mercy, which is in no way fitting for the Beauty of His Mercy and Perfection of His Justice, and in no way compatible with it.<br>  <br>  QUESTION: If a body is living, its parts are constantly being formed and dissolved; it is doomed to extinction and cannot be eternal. And eating and drinking are for the perpetuation of the individual, and sexual relations are for the perpetuation of the species. These are fundamental to this world, but there is no need for them in the world of eternity and hereafter. So why have they taken their place as the greatest pleasures of Paradise?<br>  <br>  THE ANSWER:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2894&t=The+Twenty%2DEighth+Word" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2894&...</a>|`|Wf5Tzbw5aa	Everyone wants ease and blessings.

r4oOID5Daa	Sarah, cited in the Bible as an example of obedience to her husband, Abraham. (1?Peter 3:5,?6) She subjected herself to him in matters large and small, from leaving a comfortable home for a nomadic life in tents to preparing a meal on short notice. (Genesis 12:5-9; 18:6) In connection with a serious matter, however, she repeatedly expressed a view contrary to Abraham’s. This occurred when she wanted him to dismiss his concubine, Hagar, and his firstborn son, Ishmael, from the household. Instead of reproving Sarah, God told Abraham to “listen to her voice.” Meanwhile, Sarah continued to subject herself to Abraham by waiting for him to act instead of trying to drive out Hagar and Ishmael herself.—Genesis 21:8-14.<br>  <br>  Sarah’s example shows that rather than merely living in her husband’s shadow, the wife is to be her husband’s “partner,” holding a place of honor. (Malachi 2:14) As his partner, she provides valuable input concerning family decisions and is given a measure of authority in the family, often managing many household and even some financial matters. Of course, as the family head, the husband is responsible for making final decisions.—Proverbs 31:10-31; 1?Timothy 5:14.|`|0BM73L70aa	she is  the mother of Isaac abraham's only child she is significant to a lot of Jewish families more than Christian families <br>   a lot of jewish girls are named after her look  at any holocaust survivor account or story of a jew during this time period and you are bound to turn up at least one sarah many jews would say she is the mother of their nation other than that i dont know what to tell you|`|ATurY8XRaa	And I will make thee (Abraham) exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

In Genesis we read that Ishmael was sent back east, and is today recognized by Muslims as ancestor to Muhammad and the people of Islam. Isaac remained in Canaan where his descendants became the people of Judaism. In the following passage, we read that Ishmael too is blessed, and will beget 12 princes. This corresponds to the 12 Imams in Islam: "And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation." (Genesis 17:19,20)`<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  Abraham, from whose descendants came a succession of prophets (David, Moses, Christ, Muhammad, the Bab and Baha'u'llah) was born in Ur in present day Iraq.`<br>  <br>  Abraham later traveled to Canaan where Israel was born. Baha'u'llah declared His mission near the birthplace of Abraham (Baghdad). Muhammad, the Bab and Baha'u'llah are all descendants of Abraham. (Baha'u'llah is descended through Abraham's wife, Katura.) Baha'u'llah was later banished by authorities from Baghdad to Palestine - where the Baha'is now have their world center on top of Mount Carmel - in fulfillment of yet other prophecies: And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.

Moreover, as a further testimony to the majestic unfoldment and progressive consolidation of the stupendous undertaking launched by Bahá’u’lláh on that holy mountain, may be mentioned the selection of a portion of the school property situated in the precincts of the Shrine of the Báb as a permanent resting-place for the Greatest Holy Leaf, the “well-beloved” sister of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the “Leaf that hath sprung” from the “Pre-existent Root,” the “fragrance” of Bahá’u’lláh’s “shining robe,” elevated by Him to a “station such as none other woman hath surpassed,” and comparable in rank to those immortal heroines such as Sarah, ásíyih, the Virgin Mary, Fátimih and Táhirih, each of whom has outshone every member of her sex in previous Dispensations. ...<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  ///<br>  <br>   The second classification or division comprises social laws and regulations applicable to human conduct. This is not the essential spiritual quality of religion. It is subject to change and transformation according to the exigencies and requirements of time and place. For instance in the time of Noah certain requirements made it necessary that all sea foods be allowable or lawful. During the time of the Abrahamic prophethood it was considered allowable because of a certain exigency that a man should marry his aunt, even as Sarah was the sister of Abraham’s mother. During the cycle of Adam it was lawful and expedient for a man to marry his own sister, even as Abel, Cain and Seth the sons of Adam married their sisters. But in the law of the Pentateuch revealed by Moses these marriages were forbidden and their custom and sanction abrogated. Other laws formerly valid were annulled during the 275 time of Moses. For example, it was lawful in Abraham’s cycle to eat the flesh of the camel, but during the time of Jacob this was prohibited.

Remember Abraham lived comfortably in the city of Ur. God asked him to leave that life and home and to go out and live in tents for the rest of his life in a place he did not know. What woman do you know of today that would go along with her husband living in tents instead of living in a nice fat house with all your family and friends and shopping stores. None!!! Sarah had a lot of faith not only in God but in her husband as well, she even called her husband, lord in her heart.<br>  <br>  She sets the bar pretty high for all women to follow her example of faith, respect and love for God and husbands. She was also one of the most attractive woman in her day, Pharaoh tried to take her for himself and God wasn't having that.
d9fb2acd20fb4c3590182dc9f4470d89aa	Jesus said this:<br>  <br>  19"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. <br>   22"The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. 23But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! <br>  <br>   24"No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.<br>  <br>   25"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? 26Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? <br>   28"And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? 31So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' 32For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.

First though I think you have asked a WONDERFUL question... the very fact you are asking it is a sign of maturity that a lot of people don't have.<br>  <br>  Personally... well spending $300 on shoes strikes me as silly. That is just to much to pay, no matter who's name is on the shoes.<br>  <br>  Heck you can get knock offs that look just as good for  $30.  If you know where to shop you can get  great clothes cheap. My wife knows all the good resale shops and she got a Christian Dior suit for $15.00 (!!) wore it to Church for Christmas Eve service, looked great in it.<br>  <br>  So you are paying $30 for the shoes, and $270 for what exactly?<br>  <br>  You are right, there are certianly better ways to use that $270.<br>  <br>  So the question arises... why do you feel it necessary to do that?  <br>  <br>  Do you feel a  need to be trendy and impress other people? If so why?<br>  <br>  That could fall into a number of somewhat sinful areas, such as pride or vanity, or maybe envy.  If you are deliberately trying to be nasty about it though, (as in "I got Manolos and you don't ha! ha!) then you would have a problem, but  you don't seem to be that kind of a person. I don't see a huge sin here, as long as you can afford to grossly overpay for shoes and such.<br>  <br>  The thing that would worry me is, is this getting in the way of your relationship with Jesus?  If it is then it is a problem.  If you are so into shoes that fashon is more important to you than God...then we would certianly have an issue.<br>  <br>  There is no rule against having nice things, but letting things, (be they nice things or shoddy things) get in between you and Jesus is always bad.|`|AA11502346	It's not necessarily considered sinful to buy a $300 pair of shoes but you need to think about your spending habits if you regularly buy clothing that costs so much.  Do you really need to look like a million bucks every day (I'm not talking about you personally; just in a figurative manner) or can you be more economical and not let materialism rule your life?<br>  <br>  Remember, you can go ahead and buy a pair of Manolo Blahnik high heels but don't let materialism rule your life.|`|2e06c84d21db358502c752a7100c3c3eaa	It's about wants vs needs really. Before you make a purchase we should ask our self -  do we need this or just want this? I like to buy stuff too and most of the time I don't think want/need I just buy, well I shouldn't do that. As a Christian we're supposed to use money wisely. This means we give the tithe to the church and we donate money to the furthering of the gospel of Jesus. Before you go out and buy that $300 pair of shoes, make sure you've given to God's mission first. The Lord loves a cheerful giver!|`|cfdaa128dfa2a07a157aa79c35d7f3abaa	Not really about spending too much on them.  However, we are supposed to trust God to provide for our needs, which includes clothing, and we are not to fret or worry about such things.<br>  <br>  There is also plenty said against pride and vanity.<br>  <br>  Also, we are called upon to be good stewards with God's resources.<br>  <br>  Now, one thing that concerns me is that you say that you try to be a good person.  The Christian life is not about "trying".  If you are trying, then you are leaning on your own strength.  We have to have a relationship with God through Christ Jesus.  Jesus already paid for it all and has sent the Holy Spirit to guide and instruct us.  We cannot do the Christian life alone, and we don't have to.  The key here is to get the heart right and to put God first, and all the other things, the superficial and external things, will fall into place.|`|AA11466759	Shoes, boobs, what's the difference?<br>  You earned it, so you are the lord of it<br>  Also, you will have to account for it, just like for the taxman.|`|wK85ZvOMaa	There is nothing wrong with spending money on yourself, rather than on a needy family.

Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.

Matthew 6:28|`|t3b9M0B0aa	Spending 300$ on shoes is definetly not a good decision. Why not buy a decent pair of shoes for 20-30$? Then use that extra money to buy yourself some food.... or you could buy a few more pairs of decent shoes for someone else. Materialism is a sin if that's what your wondering. Which is being more worried about storing up treasures for ourselves on earth rather than heaven.<br>  <br>  Let look at Matthew 6:19-21<br>  <br>  "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.""<br>  <br>  (That is saying clearly to not be concerned with storing up treasures on earth.)<br>  <br>  "But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."<br>  <br>  This verse is saying to store up treasures in heaven. How do we do that? By practicing true religion which is helping the widows , orphans, poor, and destitute in their time of need. Look at the very last verse "Where your treasure is your heart will be also." That means what we set our affection to and value most is what we will keep our heart fixed on.<br>  <br>  So how do you remedy this? With heaping helping of the Holy Spirit. Read the word of God and refocus your heart on the real treasure of heaven (that is Jesus Christ) Be practical also. We will all have times when we need to shop for clothes the key is to not buy the things that are too expensive. Buy shirts that cost 5-10$, shoes that cost 10-30$ etc. Just use the wisdom the Lord provided you with and he gives it to all who ask liberally. Take care and God bless! =) and get your focus on the real treasure! that is Jesus Christ

Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!! English is practically EVERYWHERE in the online world these days, you just have to use your imagination to find it!<br>  <br>  Good luck and remember to keep your attitude positive!
AA11731361	MOST Christians do not know what being a Christian is themselves so you will get a lot of wrong answers. The Bible is the text obviously. I'd suggest reading the book of John first and then also 1 John, and 2 John and 3 John for basic Christian beliefs and how they should act. Also read James. The ENTIRE Bible is used by a real Christian and not just parts. I point out books that give a good idea of the beliefs.<br>  <br>  As also given to Abraham as you know was the idea of faith in believing God is God. and none other. <br>  <br>  As it also goes without saying is that a Christian should follow the 10 Commandments but not as they are in the book but a Christian puts them in his own heart. This means that they not only follow the letter of each Commandment: Thou shalt not Steal! but also dont' THINK about stealing from anyone else. They don't give evil thoughts about doing something. The Islam faith hates the idea of a girl showing flesh to entice which IS true because you should not look upon one that you are not married to but they also go to extreme and cover all women head to toe in black. A good summary of them is to love and obey God, and also love others as much as we love ourselves. <br>  <br>  Another important and often overlooked commandment is *Forgiveness*. Example #1 is US invasion of Iraq. If Bush was a Christian he would have forgiven those that hate him but no, he is not one so we attacked. If we do not forgive those that wronged us, then God will not forgive us and we won't go to Heaven... :(  A TRUE Christian will not raise a fist in hatred. Mahatma Gandhi had some ideal Christian non-pacifist beliefs.<br>  <br>  A thirst aspect of Christianity is watching for our Messiah's return to take up His people to Himself!!  a-men. Which means watching for him and not being caught up in the day-to-day parts of life to ignore the signs of His return, plus also to be mindful of false teachings which are EVERYWHERE. For example, how many people go to Church on Sunday. All of those that do are doomed. They won't listen nor do they care.|`|4args6jHaa	There's something called the Nicene creed that pretty much sums up what Christians believe.  It says:<br>  <br>  We believe in on God,<br>  the Father, the Almighty, <br>  maker of heaven and earth, <br>  of all that is seen and unseen.<br>  <br>  We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>  the only Son of God,<br>  eternally begotten of the Father,<br>  God from God, Light from Light,<br>  true God from true God,<br>  begotten, not made,<br>  of one Being with the Father.<br>  Through him all things were made.<br>  For us and for our salvation<br>  he came down from heaven;<br>  by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>  he became incarnate of the Virgin Mary,<br>  and was made man.<br>  <br>  For our sake  he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>  he suffered death and was buried.<br>  On the third day he rose again<br>  in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>  he ascended into heaven<br>  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>  and his kingdom will have no end.<br>  <br>  We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>  who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>  With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified.<br>  He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>  We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br>  We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>  We look for the resurrection of the dead, <br>  and the life of the world to come.<br>  <br>  The Nicene creed pretty much sums up what the majority of Christians believe.  We believe that there is one God and that everything comes from God. We believet that God is so Holy and pure, that sin cannot exist in heaven.  God loved us so much that He asked a girl, Mary (Maryam to muslims)  to have his son.  That son was Jesus.  We believe that God sent Jesus to call His people back to Him and to act as a sacrifice for our sins.  We believe that after Jesus died, He returned to heaven, conquering death.  We believe that He will come at the end of the world and judge everyone.  This is a bit different from the muslim faith.  Muslims also view God as the source and creator of everything.  Unlike Christians, they believe that Jesus was a Prophet. Muslims also believe that Christians and Jews have been lead astray because their holy texts and the teaching of the prophets have been altered over time. <br>  <br>  Now...all that being said, different branches of Christianity interpret the Nicene creed differently.  As for our religious text, Christians read the Bible.  Unlike the Quran, there are different translations of the bible.  Some people prefer certain translations.. Also, the Catholic translation is a bit longer because it has books in it that Protestant specifically left out. Certain groups, such as Catholics and Epicopalians/Anglicans, also use prayer books for personal devotion.  Then, there is another group, called the Chuch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  They have the Book of Mormon.  They believe that it is another testament of Jesus.  Some of the other christian denominations do not consided Mormons to be christian.|`|9btru19waa	Read the Holy Bible. You can get one in your own language or if you are fluent in English get a New Living Translation. <br>  <br>  The bible tells us the good news, that we can not be saved by being 'good enough'. We can only be saved by accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. Jesus Christ is God. <br>  <br>  There is no other way to be saved.|`|t3b9M0B0aa	Christianity is the belief Jesus died for our sins on the cross then rose 3 days later having victory over death so that we can have the hope of  being with him Forever in heaven and be raised from the dead.<br>  <br>  God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." 2 Corinthians 5:21<br>  <br>  Jesus death on the cross WAS the judgment for our sin. If we excepted Jesus as our savior we will not be tried and condemned for our sins because Jesus took the penalty for us on the cross.<br>  <br>  You can not earn salvation it is the free gift of God through his son Jesus. And being a good person will NOT I repeat NOT save you.<br>  <br>  "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." Romans 3:23<br>  <br>  Ephesians 2:8-9<br>  "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast."<br>  <br>  The thief that died next to Jesus on the cross was saved and did NOT earn it he simply believed.<br>  <br>  "Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise." Luke 23:42<br>  <br>  Rom 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."<br>  <br>  This is saying there will be no eternal sentencing of people to hell to people who trust in Jesus to save them. It also says this..<br>  <br>  John 3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."<br>  <br>  This is saying if you believe in Jesus you are not condemned but if you don't believe in Jesus and you WILL be judged for your sins and will be found guilty. God made a way for us. Jesus said<br>  <br>  John 14:6 Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me"<br>  <br>  If you are relying on anyone other that Jesus to save you (even yourself through being a "good person") i have news for you. You are in your carnal sin nature and a slave to sin and under bondage. But the good news is there's hope to be found in Jesus death and resurrection, he paid the price so you could have eternal life. Take care and God bless|`|WEM5n41Oaa	The NIV- New International Version or the ESV- English Standard Version are my two favorite types of bibles.

Though Jesus is not recognized as a diety.  The priestly class has been removed.|`|QPbnFJGKaa	We believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  We believe in His Son Jesus Christ who died for our sins and rose again so that we could have eternal life with Him and the Father.  Our religious text so to speak is the Bible.|`|XuO2rTteaa	One of the 200 versions of the religion that says a zombie of a guy named Jesus, who was the son of a virgin (or an angel got her pregnant, depending on who you ask) that died 2000 years ago will free your soul of a curse put on by a 6000 year old rib women who was tricked into eating a fruit from a magical tree by a talking snake, if you routinely eat his flesh and blood while telepathically telling him he's your master. <br>  <br>  The texts are the old and new testament, though the only sect that actually follows them word for word that I know of are the Westboro Baptists, look them up for "pure" christianity.|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	Christianity was founded by Jesus Christ Himself. He was from God who came to earth to save the whole of mankind from the Devil who claim to be the prince of this world. Satan from the beginning was against God. He rebelled against Him. His ambition was to be like God. And there was war in heaven. One third of the angel fought against Michael and the angels of God. Satan and his angels did not prevail. So they were thrown to the earth. And Satan had been working evil against God and His people.So God sent His Son Jesus to redeem His people from the dominion of the devil. Genesis 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. Jesus when He first come Satan would bruise His heel and this was fulfilled at Calvary. At His second coming He will bruise Satan head and Satan knew this. So he is busy with his scheme of deceiving people. Those who would believe in his lies they are his but those who will believe in Christ Jesus are God's. The woman here is the nation Israel that would make way for Christ coming. He came through them and so He will come again through them. !948 when Israel became a nation again. It is a proof that God is preparing them again for Christ's return. This is Christianity as a whole. It teaches the first and the second of the Lord Jesus Christ and his conflict with Satan. His second coming will be the final judgment of Satan and his angel.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	The bible is the text although the new testament and the gospels are by far the most important teachings.

Christians tend to have a persecution complex.  They also tend to define  words like "mean" and "offensive" as "anyone who disagrees with me."<br>  <br>  B.  The above is especially true when they come into contact with atheists.  No matter how nice or moral of a person you are, there are always going to be some Christians who, the minute they find out you're an atheist, will automatically assume the worst of you.  You might as well get used to it now.<br>  <br>  C.  It doesn't help matters any that we are talking about teenage girls.  I once called one my good friends, who was an amazing person, a "whore".  Why? Because she joined the cheerleading squad when we entered the ninth grade.  I'm not proud of it, and thankfully, I grew up and we remained friends throughout.high school.  Hopefully, your friends will grow up too.  In the meantime, don't let them get to you.|`|ciROvVJVaa	A question like this can't have a simple answer. Just like there are ignorant people in general, there will be ignorant Christians. Realistically, a lot of Christians get really defensive when it comes to Atheism because what they feel they know and believe is challenged. So yea, it's gonna be really touchy so any kind of comment, especially one from someone who is against their personal beliefs, will not be taken lightly. As for the "soldier", I think she just doesn't know how to communicate to someone who she doesn't feel has a common ground, in this case, religion. It's like me saying, "Seriously? How can you not have mayo in tuna? Are you an idiot?"  Same concept. I'm not saying she's justified, cause no Christian should condemn anyone, but understand that Christians, just like Atheists, are still human beings and no one is perfect or has all the answers.

VLv3Vzjnaa	The curse of Ham was one of the excuses Mormons used for years to justify exclusion and prejudice toward Black Americans.  They also worked hard to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment and keep women in a second class position.

Gen 4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand; <br>  <br>  And, it was actually Ham's son that was cursed for what Ham had done. Gen 9: 24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. <br>  <br>  Now, if you are trying to make some sort of reference to black people and the curse of Cain and Ham, those beliefs have been in religious circles since the 300 ADs. And it was very prevalent throughout the US during the 1800 - 1900s. <br>  <br>  If you really want to know what the LDS view of black is, check out <a href="http://www.blacklds.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blacklds.org/</a><br>  <br>  The LDS Church is far more enlightened than many. <br>  <br>  Edit: I remember hearing that Cain's curse was to have the bloodline which would not hold the priesthood until the end times and black skin was the mark of those who were of Cain's bloodline through Ham. But, it was never a doctrine of the Church, just some remarks carried down through some members of the Church.
8PjHFUdfaa	The freedom granted to women in Babylonia allowed them to hold and manage their own estates.... The mother here is always represented by a sign which means "goddess of the house." <br>  <br>  Landed property developed in the hands of women because women were the first to farm the land, thereby establishing ownership of it. <br>  <br>  Religion as an instrument to deprive women and make them dependant. <br>  <br>  Christian kings commonly endowed their barons with the phrase, "Take that woman and her fief." The early centuries of the Christian conquest of Europe were largely occupied with acquisition lands from the pagan women. <br>  <br>  a man shall "leave his father and his mother, and cleave unto his wife" (Genesis 2:24). <br>  <br>  Naomi told her daughters-in-law to "return each to her mother's house" (Ruth 1:8) because houses were owned by mothers, not fathers. <br>  <br>  A marriage agreement permitting removal of a woman from her maternal home was a violation of ancient laws. Therefore Abraham, seeking a bride for his son, had to give many gifts to the bride, to her mother, and to her brother (not to her father!) as compensation for taking her away from her home (Genesis 24:53). <br>  <br>  Retention of property in the hands of a patrilineal clan was the purpose of the so-called Levirate marriage commanded by the patriarchal God (Deuteronomy 25:5). If a man died, his brother must marry the widow rather than allow her to take her property and depart from the family. <br>  <br>  Priests married to gain property, claiming that without their wives they succumb to "hunger and nakedness." Church laws revised the system; then a series of papal decretals between 1031 and 1051 ordered priests to abandon their wives and sell their children into slavery. Naturally, the property and monies thus acquired by a priest revert to the church upon his death, since he no longer had legal heirs. <br>  <br>  The legal/ecclesiastical war on female property ownership went on century after century, until women were so hamstrung by the laws of patriarchal God and man that they had almost nothing left that they could call their own. <br>  By the end of the 19th century, English wives could not administer their own property even if they had any, nor make a will disposing of it, without their husbands' consent. <br>  As late as 1930 in France and 1950 in Germany a woman was forbidden to do any business with a bank, not make small deposits, without her husband's permission. <br>  <br>  Up to the present time, lack of control over money and property is still the greatest obstacle for women who wish to bring up their children respectably or take them and leave abusive or violent husbands. In this respect the centuries of patriarchal effort achieved their goal.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No each does their part.|`|1g49KgoGaa	The bible is an ancient misogynistic book of fiction.|`|tz8UBVG4aa	According to Islam: <br>  <br>  Women in Islam and marriage are without any doubt subjects that stimulate, in our days, a lot of debates.<br>  <br>  Before starting, here is a Hadith (words from the prophet Mohamed SAW), as reported by El Tirmithi : "The most perfect of the believers is the one who follows the straight path. The best persons among you are those who are the best with their women."<br>  <br>  What does Islam say about the Muslim women?<br>  <br>  The Qu’ran indicates clearly that the only base of judgment between Muslim men and Muslim women is the piety, and not the fact of being a man or a woman.<br>  <br>  Educating Muslim girls is a duty in Islam. A Muslim woman has the right to work . A Muslim girl has the possibility to accept or to reject marriage proposals. A forced marriage against the consensus of Muslim girls is forbidden.<br>  <br>  The Islamic religion prescribes kindness toward parents, especially toward Muslim mothers, as it is commonly said “paradise is at the feet of mothers”.<br>  <br>  Raising the children after a divorce is accorded to the Muslim woman till that the child reaches the age of seven.<br>  <br>  Muslim women must be well treated by their husband.|`|AA11502346	The Bible says that women must honor their husbands and husbands must love their wives as Christ loved the church (in other words, men must treat their women with RESPECT).

Try to find topics that interest you and learn the language that way, and actively search more material (audio/video things, discussion sites, online newspapers...) from the internet.

The penis has complete feeling, and can become erect through arousal. The problem is that it's small. Your partner might wonder why it is really small, and a possible answer might be "hidden penis" but all in all it's passable. Phalloplasty takes a large skin graft from your arm and makes it into a phallus shape. It doesn't serve much in the way of function, but it's bigger. Usually a pump is implanted to make it erect since it cannot naturally happen.<br>  <br>  Most guys don't get bottom surgery since the options are pretty sh-tty. There are, however some really amazing prosthetic out there that are passable (and probably cheaper).|`|1T2qiNIvaa	I have an uncle who became my aunt, he looks nothing like a woman.

At least where I live, both black and white people are extremely prone to self-segregating. I think it does have a lot to do with comfort factor. <br>  <br>  To answer your main question, us whiteys (lol whiteys XD) tend to be extremely insecure about race. It's almost beaten into us from primary-school age - I remember all my teachers told me that slavery got started because the ebil ebil white man went over to Africa and kidnapped the natives, when in fact there is much more to the story than that. Don't get me wrong, slavery was a pretty crap deal, but it also just wasn't as simple as they taught us. <br>  <br>  I think a lot of us are so paranoid about offending an African American person about their race that we go out of our way to show off how pro-equal rights we are, like you mentioned, when in fact it's just another form of racism. <br>  <br>  I'm not sensitive about race because I DO truly believe in equal rights and I practice what I preach by treating everyone pretty much the same, and judging them based on character and actions.|`|ACGBj2liaa	first thanks for being Gracious, us white folk can be pretty ignorant,  I grew up with (insert appropriate name here) I say that as I never know who is comfortable with what. Anyways,  I never had gotten myself into that situation as everyone is the same to me. Here is the problem, it is not so much we think that like skinned people will be attracted to on another, we are conditioned to think people like to date within there own race. Some people feel if they say they have (insert appropriate name here) friends it will make you feel more comfortable to be around them, in other words he does not belong to the KKK.  someday things will get better for you, as for me well, my 2 yr old granddaughter who is Black and asian  went to the store and 3 yes 3 people asked me if I adopted her, I laughed and said no I'm not Brad Pitt, 2 looked at me like WHAT???  so you see us whiteys are just plain dumb LOL    have a great future|`|bUDOZFDAaa	face it we are segregated for the most part. sad but true. i mean i grew up in a mostly white area, i am white, i did have some childhood friends of different races but most were white( sorry but i thought a little background might be helpful ). when i was in the 3rd or fourth grade i played basketball, my coach knew another coach from a predominately black part of town and we scrimmaged. almost all my teammates were intimidated i think this was the first time a lot them ever saw another person of different race their own age. the other team looked at us differently too. my point is that meeting people of different races can be a new experience ( or one not so common ), and to some when faced with something new people react in odd ways. i know what you are saying and it is silly but people aren't perfect and racism still exists. i think it is a form of passive sub conscious racism. we all make assumption about one another based on what we see, whether it be race, clothes, who they are with, what they are doing, etc. another thought is they may be trying to make you comfortable. but who knows.|`|hE50eekRaa	Some blacks think that all whites are racist.

Those who say that He didn't raise from the dead also could be called antichrists.|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	In his great work "De Civitate Dei," St Augustine says once that the whole of human history, the history of the world, is a struggle between two loves: love of God to the point of losing oneself, of total self-giving, and love of oneself to the point of despising God, of hating others. This same interpretation of history as a struggle between two loves, between love and selfishness, also appears in the reading from the Book of Revelation that we have just heard.<br>  <br>  Here, these two loves appear in two great figures. First of all, there is the immensely strong, red dragon with a striking and disturbing manifestation of power without grace, without love, of absolute selfishness, terror and violence.<br>  <br>  At the time when St John wrote the Book of Revelation, this dragon represented for him the power of the anti-Christian Roman Emperors, from Nero to Domitian. This power seemed boundless; the military, political and propagandist power of the Roman Empire was such that before it, faith, the Church, appeared as a defenseless woman with no chance of survival and even less of victory.<br>  <br>  Who could stand up to this omnipresent force that seemed capable of achieving everything? Yet, we know that in the end it was the defenceless woman who won and not egoism or hatred; the love of God triumphed and the Roman Empire was opened to the Christian faith.<br>  <br>  The words of Sacred Scripture always transcend the period in history. Thus, not only does this dragon suggest the anti-Christian power of the persecutors of the Church of that time, but also anti-Christian dictatorships of all periods.<br>  <br>  We see this power, the force of the red dragon, brought into existence once again in the great dictatorships of the last century: the Nazi dictatorship and the dictatorship of Stalin monopolized all the power, penetrated every corner, the very last corner. It seemed impossible in the long term that faith could survive in the face of this dragon that was so powerful, that could not wait to devour God become a Child, as well as the woman, the Church. But also in this case, in the end love was stronger than hate.<br>  <br>  Today too, the dragon exists in new and different ways. It exists in the form of materialistic ideologies that tell us it is absurd to think of God; it is absurd to observe God's commandments: they are a leftover from a time past. Life is only worth living for its own sake. Take everything we can get in this brief moment of life. Consumerism, selfishness and entertainment alone are worthwhile. This is life. This is how we must live. And once again, it seems absurd, impossible, to oppose this dominant mindset with all its media and propagandist power. Today too, it seems impossible to imagine a God who created man and made himself a Child and who was to be the true ruler of the world.<br>  <br>  Even now, this dragon appears invincible, but it is still true today that God is stronger than the dragon, that it is love which conquers rather than selfishness.<br>  <br>  Having thus considered the various historical forms of the dragon, let us now look at the other image: the woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, surrounded by 12 stars. This is also a multidimensional image.<br>  <br>  Without any doubt, a first meaning is that it is Our Lady, Mary, clothed with the sun, that is, with God, totally; Mary who lives totally in God, surrounded and penetrated by God's light. Surrounded by the 12 stars, that is, by the 12 tribes of Israel, by the whole People of God, by the whole Communion of Saints; and at her feet, the moon, the image of death and mortality.<br>  <br>  Mary has left death behind her; she is totally clothed in life, she is taken up body and soul into God's glory and thus, placed in glory after overcoming death, she says to us: Take heart, it is love that wins in the end!<br>  <br>  The message of my life was: I am the handmaid of God, my life has been a gift of myself to God and my neighbor. And this life of service now arrives in real life. May you too have trust and have the courage to live like this, countering all the threats of the dragon.<br>  <br>  This is the first meaning of the woman whom Mary succeeded in being. The "woman clothed with the sun" is the great sign of the victory of love, of the victory of goodness, of the victory of God; a great sign of consolation.<br>  <br>  Yet, this woman who suffered, who had to flee, who gave birth with cries of anguish, is also the Church, the pilgrim Church of all times. In all generations she has to give birth to Christ anew, to bring him very painfully into the world, with great suffering. Persecuted in all ages, it is almost as if, pursued by the dragon, she had gone to live in the wilderness.<br>  <br>  However, in all ages, the Church, the People of God, also lives by the light of God and as the Gospel says is nourished by God, nourishing herself with the Bread of the Holy Eucharist. Thus, in all the trials in the various situations of the Church through the ages in different parts of the world, she wins throug|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Officially, according to the Bible, one that denies that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is an anti-christ. <br>  <br>  So, if a person is of another faith that denies that Jesus has been born of a virgin, lived, crucified, died, was resurrected & lives at the hand of the Father...then they could be termed anti-Christ. (In this aspect, it doesn't apply only to those born in the Christian faith, but they are the only ones likely to subscribe to this doctrine.)<br>  <br>  1 John 4:1 says to test all spirits for there are many false prophets gone out into the world. This refers to spirits (such as familiars or ghosts) and also ppl who teach a doctrine other than that mentioned above. <br>  <br>  If a religion denies Christ, then it is anti-Christ...even though the ppl can be good moral upstanding citizens. Polytheistic religions, Hinduism being one, have many gods-none of them Jesus. The monotheistic religion Islam puts all the focus on the propet Mohammed & not Christ. Buddhism is more a philosophy than a belief in a deity; its focus is a way of being & detaching from troubles. See the theme of each one not recognizing Christ? <br>  <br>  Some ppl think anti-christ is referring to one being/person who comes at the end of the age & wreaks havoc on earth, but there are many already present in belief systems, philosophies & ppl currently in existence.<br>  <br>  The old movie the Omen was about demons & spirit possession more than anything.|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	1 John 2:22 -23 Who is the liar?

The spicy taste will be cut in half easily, although the texture will be that of mush, it will make it more bearable. Plus buttermilk will NOT offend, many Hindus use it to reduce the spice. The flavors are rather unappealing at first, so ask her to make Chipote' (Chi-pot-E), it is a form of bread that is used to eat with, that will assist greatly, I promise that.

The Japaense always drop the last 'r' on the end of a word if it has no vowel after it, like in your name.<br>  <br>  So your name In Japanese would be<br>  <br>  ビノード　ネアー<br>  bi-noh-do ne-ah<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  ビノード　ネー<br>  bi-noh-do nehh<br>  <br>  If your name ryhmes with 'air' then the first one is the best. If your last name is just a long 'ehh' sound, then the second one is the best.<br>  <br>  The way that the above people have written it, your last name sounds more like,'Nell'<br>  <br>  Hope this helps <(^-*)^|`|lKFNC2Waaa	ビノード　ネール IN KATAKANA.<br>  びのーど　ねーる IN HIRAGANA.<br>  美野土　音留　IF YOU WANT IN KANJI.<br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|5bubIL4Gaa	ビノード　ネール<br>  bino-do ne-ru<br>  <br>  there's no 'v' sound in japanese|`|R9BNBv1uaa	because your name in japanese is a borrowed word it would be written in katakana.<br>  you would pronounce it rinodo neru<br>  so look up the katakana for that|`|TH0r2ZhBaa	ecchi

There is nothing said in the teachings that God lives on a planet there, so we cannot say yes or no to that question. <br>  <br>  In the Pearl of Great Price, in Abraham 3:9 it states: And thus there shall be the reckoning of the time of one planet above another, until thou come nigh unto Kolob, which Kolob is after the reckoning of the Lord’s time; which Kolob is set nigh unto the throne of God, to govern all those planets which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest. <br>  <br>  Edit: Kanye East, the LDS Church does not teach that blacks are cursed, that is an anti-Mormon tactic to attack the Church. If you really want to know the views of blacks and the Church check out www. blacklds.org<br>  <br>  Edit: History, the scroll you are talking about is not the one that Abraham was translated from. It does not match the description given by Joseph Smith of that scroll. Joseph wrote of red markings on the side of that scroll, this scroll has none of those.|`|vpNqGHQtaa	yep...thats where idea fir kobol came from on battlestar galactica,|`|p18BmlIxaa	Yep.  It's in their scriptures.  In the same book that Joseph Smith "translated" from a papyrus scroll that was supposedly written by Abraham, but when Egyptologists got ahold of it and translated it for real, turned out to be a pagan funerary document from two thousand years after Abraham's time.<br>  <br>  They also have a hymn about it, called, "If I Could Hie to Kolob".  I've never heard it sung in a Mormon service, though.  I don't think they sing it much anymore, on account of "God lives on planet near a star called Kolob" makes them look a bit silly to outsiders.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	Joseph Smith translated an Egyptian funeral scroll that some of his followers purchased from a traveling salesman. He came out with the Pearl of Great Price, the Book of Abraham. The scroll was thought to be lost, but recently resurfaced in a museum. It has absolutely nothing on it that reads like what Smith wrote from it of course.<br>  <br>  From their 'Standard Works', the Pearl of Great Price, Book of Abraham:<br>  <br>        Abr. 3: 3-4, 9, 16<br>          3 And the Lord said unto me: These are the governing ones; and the name of the great one is Kolob, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God: I have set this one to govern all those which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.<br>          4 And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its times and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one revolution was a day unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one thousand years according to the time appointed unto that whereon thou standest. This is the reckoning of the Lord’s dtime, according to the reckoning of Kolob.<br>              ?  ?  ?<br>          9 And thus there shall be the reckoning of the time of one planet above another, until thou come nigh unto Kolob, which Kolob is after the reckoning of the Lord’s time; which Kolob is set nigh unto the throne of God, to govern all those planets which belong to the same border as that upon which thou standest.<br>              ?  ?  ?<br>          16 If two things exist, and there be one above the other, there shall be greater things above them; therefore Kolob is the greatest of all the Kokaubeam that thou hast seen, because it is nearest unto me.<br>    <br>        Abr. 5: 13<br>          13 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the time that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. Now I, Abraham, saw that it was after the Lord’s time, which was after the time of Kolob; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning.|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	What are your beliefs about where heaven is?<br>  Do you believe that it is an actual physical place?<br>  Or do you believe that it is some intangible place that will or might come into existence after judgment day?<br>  Or have you even put any thought into the concept before criticizing our beliefs on the subject?<br>  We believe, as do many other Christian denominations, that God has a body of flesh and bones. After His resurrection Jesus Christ made it a point to let His followers touch and feel His body so that they could know that he actually had a body and was not just some disembodied spirit. He ate meat with them as well to demonstrate this same idea. Now if God does have a body of flesh and bones, doesn't it make sense to believe that He also would have a place to live as well? And What does it matter if God decided to tell us what star is closest to where he lives. Additionally we are not told what meaning of the word closest is being used. Does it mean a physical distance or does it simply mean that the people who live on that world, that is orbiting that star, that God created have lived their lives in such a way to be the closest to God out of any of His other creations?<br>  Additionally the verse never mentions that God lives on a planet. It just states that Kolob is the star near to God.|`|Et011ogJaa	Yes...and not to make fun... but....can you believe we live near a planet called mars.

Therefore, "kore wa" means "this is."<br>  In Japanese, "watashi" means "me" or "I," and "no" is a particle that can be used to give belonging to someone. By combining "watashi" and "no," you get "my."<br>  To say "picture" or "photo" in japanese, you use "shashin."<br>  The term "desu" is used at the end of a sentence to give it more of a polite or formal feeling. It is not always necessary to use it though.<br>  <br>  And, all together, you get "kore wa watashi no shashin desu," which means "this is my picture."<br>  <br>  =^.^=<br>  <br>  Hope I helped you!|`|2Q3aOzebaa	これはわたしのえです。<br>  kore wa watashi no e desu.<br>  <br>  「これ」kore = this<br>  「は」wa = topic marker<br>  「わたし」watashi = me/my/i<br>  「の」no = possessive marker<br>  「え」e = picture/painting/drawing<br>  「です」desu = is<br>  <br>  you can use either 'e' or 'shashin' for picture, but shashin means photograph.|`|6b732103367783f78c674ad4ce821550aa	これ は         私の    写真       です。<br>  これ は    わたしの  しゃしん です。<br>  kore wa watashino syashin desu<br>  [This/subject marker/my/picture/is]|`|b4s0iroSaa	これは私の写真です<br>  kore wa watashi no sashin desu|`|BGPkhulLaa	これが私の写真

The BIBLE uses a very interesting word that fits this topic perfectly "immanuel" (GOD with us). Why? Because He said in the beginning that if we sinned we would die. Man proceeded to sin and therefore man now justly deserves to go to hell but, God who is the ultimate law giver loves us so  He gave His only begotten Son (Jesus) to die for us and to take our place, and our punishment. But why if God is really all powerful didn't He just change the rules? The reason for this that God who is all powerful also is  just and He does not change the rules once He sets them. His rule was don't sin, but  we did. So He became man to save man by taking man's punishment. He now states these rules along with the original rule 1. We must repent of our sins, 2. We must ask Him to forgive us of our sins, 3. We must accept that Jesus is the only payment for our sins,4.

38vza5Gxaa	answer: 1)  Unlike other religions - Judaism does NOT seek out converts. They accept converts but do not seek them out.  Judaism also teaches that you don't have to be Jewish to reach G-d, anyone who is righteous will do that.  Therefore, they don't go around trying to convert everyone.<br>  <br>  2)  Seeking converts was a death sentence for Jews throughout history.  Often the convert, the rabbi and the entire Jewish community were put to death if someone converted to Judaism.<br>  <br>  3)  Jews were massacred frequently throughout history by Muslims and Christians.  During the crusades, for example, it was easier to slaughter the Jews in Europe than travel all the way to the Holy Land and fight Muslims.  You could take their land, their goods and feel good about protecting Christian land.  In Czarist Russia, Jews were forced to live in small villages in inhospitable land and were subject to frequent massacres.  In the Middle East, Jews were second class citizens and frequently harassed and killed. <br>  <br>  4)  Holocaust - millions were killed during the insanity of the Nazi regime and in communist Russia.|`|AA12245463	"The thought that there are not many Jews in this world indicates that this could not be the truth."

Don't you know that Christians are also chosen people of God? That they are supposed to be with Israel as children of Abraham.

I am sure other religions have lost that many over warring with each other over that period of time as well. I guess its the combination of all these factors. <br>  <br>  Christianity and Islam are both about spreading the word and both have ease to entry either through word or sword.|`|eDYXQxA9aa	Don’t Jews want people to become Jews and know the truth?<br>  <br>  Not specially.

Religions offer temporary relief to troubled consciences, and it keeps them self righteous.<br>  <br>  However knowing God is different than religion. When you repent and trust in Jesus Christ's work on the cross,  you are born again, and you'll start loving the things God loves and hating the things God hates.  It may fulfill needs and all, but more importantly, God has found someone who was humble enough to fall before him and surrender his live to Him. In that you'll be lifted up and loved by God, your creator as his own child. You'll no longer be God's enemy through wicked works.  God became a Man in Jesus Christ, lived a perfect life, and died as a payment for your sins. For such a sacrifice, God demands that all men repent and believe on Jesus that their sins may be forgiven.  Denying Christ is denying God's forgiveness. It is saying you will pay for your own sins against God. However the enormity of sins is beyond your own comprehension.<br>  <br>  Jesus said if you look with lust you've committed adultery in your heart. Think of how many times you've done that.

muHctmaGaa	You are not a sinner. I cannot understand anyone who would condemn love. There is a great flaw in this language that sexuality is taken as the base of attraction. Look around; seems like anyone can sleep with anyone, it's not serious. Homosexuality is homoaffection (and thus, heteroaffection and so on). It's who you LOVE. What is the point of homosexual love being okay with God but not "homosexual acts"? I'm very discouraged how so many homosexuals prop "choice" in front of self-loathing. Hold on to your morals; they make you more than any myopic Christian can take away.<br>  <br>  Lynn Lavner: "The Bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals. That doesn't mean that God doesn't love heterosexuals. It's just that they need more supervision."<br>  <br>  Scripture should not be taken out of context. Leviticus also advocates domestic violence and slavery. Other abominations include lying, wearing garments of the opposite sex or mixed/synthetic fabrics, sex while menstruating, remarrying a divorced spouse, and the oft-quoted eating pork, birds, and shellfish. The word translated as abomination originally just meant unclean and wasn't as harsh in condemnation. And the word used about "man lying with man" was the same used for rape (shekab) in several other passages relating to heterosexuals. Sodom and Gomorrah was not about homosexuality at all, but corruption and inhospitality, and can be disproved just by the fact Lot tried to stall the crowd after the angels by offering the use of his daughters. What good would that be to gay men? And how holy was Lot to sacrifice his daughters (who later got him drunk and raped him anyway)? Deuteronomy said not to bring sodomites into the house of the lord, but has at least three crazy ideas on how to handle rape, 22:23-24 actually suggesting that abuser and victim be stoned outside the city together and another that they should be married after she's been defiled through violence.|`|WEM5n41Oaa	I've had 2 friends who were gay and believed in Jesus.

Maybe we can give shoes to the poor people in other countries who lack shoes! Or toilets!<br>  <br>  *if you marry, you must be "open" to having children... Catholics & Natural family planning, Catholics do not like contraceptives.  I also have kids. But I do not recommend you do the same. If you decide to leave the mommy (as you may do so, if you desire the opposite sex all your life...) It would be a terrible trauma to the kids. Oh? "People divorce all the time." you say? That does NOT make it right!!! (Think of the children!) No divorce for  Catholics, maybe an "annulment" if you try and try to get your spouse to stop abusing you or alcohol, seek treatment, and find it does not work, ONLY then, is an annulment granted. We should seek to be with our married spouse forever. Don't put on an act and pretend to be a happily married man if you are not. The woman might really want someone who desires her in bed. (She might not though. It depends on the woman. Lots of women can live without sex for a long period of time.)<br>  Kids are completely awesome! I love kids! I love babies! It makes my life worthwhile to care for another human being. I never knew such love existed until I had babies. Babies taught me how to love.

You might want to see if there is an independent catholic church that meets near where you live.  Independent Catholic churches are NOT roman catholic.  They are Old Catholic in faith.  The Old Catholics originally broke from Rome over the issue of papal infallibility.  Now, there are several differences such as the ordination of women, married people, and homosexuals.  They are a truly tolerant church.  If you can't find one near you, then google it.  Science has shown that homosexual sexual orientation  is due to hormones released during pregnancy.  YOU are NOT a sin.  You are a child of God.  As the saying goes, 'God don't make junk."  He has such a special purpose for you.  Seek it out.  Seek Him.  God made you the way you are.  He gave you your sense of humor, your tolerance, your empathy, your personality, and yes..your sexual orientation.  I know that others here will disagree with me..but you are a child of God. Perhaps instead of asking that he take it from you, you should thank God for everything wonderful that He's given you and ask Him to show you His purpose for you.  Then, just sit, be still, and listen for Him.  You may not get your answer immediately, but you will eventually.  Just trust in Him.

Next time someone tells you that homosexuality is a choice, you say "Oh, so you could be gay then?  You are attracted to the same sex but just don't act on it?"  The same books in the bible that condemn homosexual acts also call for people to be killed for being disobedient children, and for picking up sticks on the sabbath.

Bear with me.<br>  <br>  I know you've already stated you consider the bible to be flawed, so I don't know what authority we can refer to concerning the issue of being gay.  I'll convey to you what I believe the bible says about homosexuality, and you can do what you will with that.<br>  <br>  Let's start here.  Firstly, according to the scriptures, homosexuality is not a sin.  Homosexual acts are sin.  I know, you're thinking "What"?  Stay with me.  The bible does not address the psychological disposition of homosexuality, it only condemns homosexual acts.  A mere disposition to homosexuality was either unknown or not spoken of in the era of the bible. Liking men, if you're a man, is not necessarily a sin.  Having sex with a man, if you're a man, is a sin.  No one can possibly choose to be homosexual--that means, if true, that heterosexuals also choose to be straight, and we didn't.  Having said that though, I do not believe we're born genetically with a sexual orientation--there's no proof of that.  So if we didn't choose it, and we're not born with it, how did we acquire it?  I haven't finished my own study on this yet, but I believe, like a lot of behavior, it is a product of many external, societal, sociological, and personal influences over time.  <br>  <br>  So what is a homosexual to do then, should he believe homosexual acts are a sin?  Years ago, I was neck deep in drugs.  Jesus got me out of it.  To this day, I still think about doing drugs sometimes, especially when I see them on television being used on some movie or television program. I am now predisposed mentally to liking drugs. However, I can't and won't go out and get a needle and some smack and give in to the temptation.  I understand you're going to scream at me in rage, but celibacy is really the only answer.  There are homosexuals who love God that have done it.  I wouldn't dream of trying to turn anyone straight--you can't.  The best you can do is encourage celibacy.  Your plight is not easy, and I sympathize, I really do.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	Homosexuality is fine dear.

This is the story where his opponent hits the centre of the board and he also hits the centre by split his opponents arrow.|`|vhlORK4Waa	A Tale of Little John<br>  <br>  The first thing you should know about Little John is that he is not -- little, that is. Some stories say he was over seven feet tall. Often he looks like a wild man with a thick beard and dressed in skins.<br>  <br>  The next thing you should know about Little John is that he is Little, -- John Little is his real name. However, some say it is really John Naylor or le Nailer. It's said he comes from Hathersage in Derbyshire, the shire next to Nottinghamshire which was controlled by the same sheriff. His grave can be found in a churchyard in Hathersage. <br>  <br>  Little John is Robin Hood's lieutenant, his second-in-command. In the early ballads, he is nearly as important as his master. John has his own adventures. For example, there's the time he entered a Nottingham archery contest. The sheriff liked what he saw and hired Little John. Using the alias Reynold Greenlefe, the outlaw promised to be the worst servant the sheriff ever had. By the story's end, Little John encouraged the sheriff's cook to join Robin's band and they lured the sheriff into the greenwood where he was robbed by Robin Hood. In another ballad, John dresses as a beggar and fights three miserly beggars.<br>  <br>  He is an excellent swordsman and archer. In fact, one time Little John beat Robin in a playful archery contest. Robin refused to pay up and John quit his service. Then Robin got captured by a monk's treachery. It was Little John who organized the Merry Men to trick the sheriff and even the king in order to rescue Robin. Once free, Robin Hood apologized and offered to make Little John the leader of the band. John refused. No matter how much they fight, Robin is always the master.<br>  <br>  Little John's best-known weapon is the quarterstaff. He was carrying a quarterstaff when he first met Robin Hood.<br>  <br>  One day Robin Hood was bored. There hadn't been an adventure in weeks. And so he left the Merry Men behind and went in search of excitement. Robin found it when he came across a stream with a long, narrow bridge. He started to cross the bridge. On the other side was a tall stranger who was also crossing the bridge. Neither would not back down.<br>  <br>  Robin threatened to shoot the stranger, declaring "I'll show you right Nottingham play!"<br>  <br>  The stranger called Robin a coward. "Well arm'd with a long bow you stand,/To shoot at my breast, while I, I protest,/ Have nought but a staff in my hand."<br>  <br>   Robin lowered his bow and went to carve himself a staff. Then, Robin and the stranger battled each other long and hard. Both were wounded. But finally, the stranger knocked Robin into the brook. The outlaw was "floating away with the tide".<br>  <br>  Thus, Robin conceded the battle. He climbed out of the water, and blew his bugle horn. The Merry Men, led by Will Stutely, appeared. Robin's men threatened to fight the stranger. But Robin stopped them. Robin asked the stranger if he'd like to join the Merry Men and wear the Lincoln green clothing of the outlaw band.<br>  <br>  The stranger accepted. And he was baptized into the band by Will Stutely. To quote again from the ballad, <br>  <br>  "This infant was call'd John Little,"<br>  quoth he.<br>  "Which name shall be chang'd anon,<br>  The words we'll transpose, so where-<br>  ever he goes,<br>  His name shall be called Little John." <br>  Then, Little John was dressed in green and took his place in the band.<br>  <br>  In some movies, John loses the fight on the bridge. In the Kevin Costner movie, John is the original leader of the outlaws, and it's Robin who joins them and assumes control of the Merry Men after he had won the quarterstaff duel.<br>  <br>  Some modern stories portray Little John as nothing more than a dumb sidekick, but in the earliest tales, he was as crafty as Robin Hood himself. In fact, an old meaning of the word Little was "tricky" or "clever", not small. In some tales, Little John is a gentle man. In others, he can be downright angry and violent. He beheads a monk in one story and shoots the sheriff in the back in another. And in one modern story, he even killed a woman who spurned him. Thankfully his bad temper is usually not so monstrous.<br>  <br>  He might grumble or argue, but when push comes to shove, Little John is always there for Bold Robin. You couldn't ask for a more loyal friend.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and have a look at the link below to see a lot more tales of Robin Hood and his Merry Men and Lady Marian.<br>  Halcon

6SwaWSoyaa	It is offensive either way.<br>  I know of black people that get on to other black people for using the word.<br>  The word is trash and needs to be dropped totally from the English language.<br>  <br>  I also think the words f*g, spick, and cracka need to be dropped.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	What's wrong with calling your mom and telling her how great she was last night?|`|b371fd5225e0f0948944cb7d323618b7aa	it was a sore spot because of slavery.|`|pcHCLfZkaa	He did not just go there.<br>  <br>  Lol, just kidding.<br>  <br>  I do think it's a little odd how we can't say it and they turn around and say it likes it's nothing. =l<br>  <br>  Either way, it's a horrible word, and shouldnt be used.|`|kpcJNDtLaa	Nothing|`|VFjQ8hujaa	Why would you call them that in the first place....i'm sure they have a First Name.|`|deEWD1k3aa	because way back when it was a derogatory term used for african americans.  these days the connotation has been passed down and if a non-black uses this term some find it as disrespectful and insensitive to ancestors.<br>  <br>  **a side note** why is it that blacks call white people crackers or whatever and get away with it lol?|`|7qF6R7d5aa	its like when straights say fag at u... only gays can call each other fags...<br>  as Oprah tells it as i recall it on one of her shows, words are very powerful, and that word is filled with anger, hatred and all the negativity of the past which (her) ancestors have put up with...|`|3w1u6mQJaa	I hate that word with a burning passion.

4sh2oRR7aa	Spaniards are white Europeans. The majority are white. About 90% Spanish. 10% other.|`|9ZQnd2rmaa	If  you are looking for stats on modern Spain, go with the last answer. If you are talking about the ethnic origins of indigenous Spaniards, google Y chromosome and mtdna of Spain.|`|v1JBAwSTaa	88.7% Spanish,<br>  <br>   11.3% Other (Romanian, Moroccan, Ecuadorian, Colombian, British)<br>  <br>  <br>  They are classified as simply "Spanish".
mRLYY14Yaa	Many are under the impression that they are more mixed than their more northernly neighbors because they are. Remember the Moors who were from North Africa? Or the Amerindian people whom they conquered and interbred with, who were then brought over or immigrated to Spain in albeit limited but unknown numbers? Don't forget the gypsies, many of whom have mixed with the Spaniard too.<br>  <br>  So no many of us don't think the Spaniards got their darkness from the sun only. But that doesn't mean we're saying Spaniards and Portuguese aren't Caucasian since technically there aren't that many races one can even check on a form. Even Arabs and Middle Easterners check "caucasian".|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Lol, you're talking about Europeans who obviously are caucasians.<br>  <br>  While I am Arab, and I am Caucasian as well.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	Many Spaniards aren't tanned and are born dark so it both sun and genetics. Spanish/Portuguese are dark and forbid white people not be pasty as everyone stereotypes them to be.<br>  <br>  Latina: Spanish qualify as Hispanic, dummy. They're the original Hispanics. All people who are from Spain or Latin America are classified as Hispanics. Spaniards are white, caucasian, European, Hispanic or White Hispanic. Whatever you wanna call 'em. And the majority consider theselves white.|`|dPuWIWj6aa	I totally agree with you.  It seems that most Americans are very uninformed. Spain & Portugal is in the European hemisphere. They are ALL considered caucasian.  Because of the migration of these peoples to Africa & various other dark skinned islands there is intermingling of the bloods. After hundreds of years of inter-marrying there are many dark skinned Spanish & Portuguese people. for instance: Mexicans,Puerto Ricans,Caribbean Islanders ect,ect,ect. Even in Hawaii you'll find evidence of this. Knowledge is power.<br>       A Potuguese American here....|`|C9QQPROkaa	Because most Caucasians primary language isn't spanish and most of them have blue and green eyes Ii Rarely see mexicans with blue or green eyes they are no more white then i am.

I remember before I learned how to speak spanish I went to a party and I had no idea what was being said and so I was borded Then and gentlemen entered I was so happy to see another amercian /english speaker there I jumped up and went over to him saying ( Hi how are you? Whats your name? ) and he had beautiful blue eyes and blonde hair and he looked at his friends and asked ( que? que dices?  Perdon pero yo no habla ingles? )  I was so surprised.|`|w9ts2mPAaa	why do sooooo many people wanna be considered caucasian? u should be proud people think your unique from the rest of Europe & not from a cold FRIGID European country like Yugoslavia!<br>  <br>  I Believe that in Argentina only 2-5% of their population is genetically considered non-white. Spain:12% at least<br>  <br>  besides the history of the many former kingdoms of spain cant be described with such an umbrella word such as "caucasian" <br>  <br>  Be proud ur unique|`|v1JBAwSTaa	Americans view them as "Darker", <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes They are White People, They are WHITE WHITE does that make you happy? mr. im white?
hhF7q0Daaa	Are you 100% sure he is straight?<br>  If so, be very careful! The last thing you want is affection for someone who will never return it (I've been there).<br>  <br>  Where do you guys sit in class? Close to each other?  How much interaction is allowed in class?  And do you guys have any other classes together (or lunch)?<br>  <br>  In short, how often can you two be together? If it is only in that German class, you're being restricted by the teacher's rules and crap.<br>  <br>  If you ever have a project or anything in which you'll be allowed to "pair-up" with somebody, ask him if he'll join you.  If you only have the opportunity to see him in class, you'll have to use that little amount of time to your advantage.  Steer away from seeming stalker-ish.  <br>  <br>  After you feel the relationship between you two have advanced, expound upon it by spending time together outside of school!  This will bring you two even closer!<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|AA11317789	If he likes the hole and not the pole, then it's best not to try to get too close.|`|r7Vhc9zNaa	Ugh. Story of my life.

I then told him that i better check in with my mother, and I pretty much ran for my life. I almost puked. I love girls. =(|`|7YuZOErRaa	Honestly, just stay away.

This is because by cloning Jesus it would be in a way transporting Jesus to our time, sort of taking Jesus from his time and making him appear in our time.  It would still be the same person that had lived before and would now be living among us.  Kind of if you where to freeze a person and then defrost him or her 2000 years after.  Besides, people would have to brain wash him in order to take him to the "right path" and even though scientist where to clone Jesus, he would still have to grow up in our society which honestly we know Jesus wouldn't turn out the same, lol.|`|gLcLQAHRaa	Research "The Shroud of Turin," it's pretty kool.

I must admit the type of folk that get to Heaven will have a good habit of humility so it will not be very often if at all but yes, it will be still possible to get God angry.<br>  <br>  And NO there is no such thing as eternal security.

The trick is filling the stuff out.  I took one look at the dozens of forms and hired a lawyer to do the paper work for me.  It would probably cost you about $1500.00 for a lawyer to help you.  My divorce ended up costing me, in attorney fees alone, about $10,000.00.  I had assets and my ex contested it.

ttTDiJWfaa	It's about insecurity. The concept of threats of burning in Hell failed, saying science is not important failed, all of the arguments failed decades ago. Now all they can do is try to use science to "prove" them right.

ALL Christians need to snack God the Son Jesus Christ in some way as part of the “salvation” package. Jesus talked about eating his meat and drinking his blood to have “eternal life” <br>  <br>  John 6:53 (Infallible King James Version) Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you (DUCK!), Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man* (*Jesus Christ), and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.<br>  <br>  It takes years of Christian Bible schooling to learn how to do it just right or Christians can get real sick and die! Protestants have relaxed this warning, but Catholics still believe that the Host* (*wafer) and Wine is magically transformed into the ACTUAL Meat and Holy Blood of Jesus so extraordinary measures are taken after Mass to monitor that no trace of the body of Jesus Christ is found in any spent chewing gum stuck under the church pews! I AM NOT KIDDING!<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 1:29-30 (infallible King James Version of the Bible) For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep* (*have died… hey… any little bit of Mafia talk helps to shape the faith as Christians go!).<br>  <br>  The Bible story says that most of the Jewish followers of Jesus wouldn’t stomach so much grossness and quit following him. The Bible writers still had the idea of having Jesus’ meat beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit as the dignified “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world” while grotesquely hanging totally naked nailed to a Holy Cross! There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed any of their victim’s genital area in a white diaper before hanging them on any cross no matter how holy! In fact, there is no record that the Romans crucified anybody in Jerusalem outside of the Bible record, either. The Romans were known to IMPALE their victims driving a pole into their rectum and making them stand on it until after a few days later when the thick pole reached the heart or lung killing the victims by their body weight! Jesus hardly suffered a sissy man’s death hanging from his 2 nailed hands. BTW, it is a SCIENTIFIC FACT that no human being can possibly be hanging any length of time by their own weight nailed to a “cross” while conducting a long conversation with his peers on the other crosses about the philosophy of life like Jesus did! Anybody with any measurable IQ can tell you that! This fact alone proves the fact that only a bunch of perverts could have possibly dreamed up a religion like Christianity! Spiritually speaking, of course! Today ALL Christians and Catholics snack on Jesus’ spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Sacrament of the Holy Communion to go to Heaven when they die! <br>  <br>  There is more brutal violence in the Bible than in any TV show. The Bible writers have this God character rewarding people committing the most heinous crimes as long as they do it to further his cause! Islam copied the same idea from the Bible! All the Bible writers picked heroes based on their past bloody criminal performance like Moses, Samson, King David, Saint Paul, just to mention a few. Even the King James Version of the Bible promotes the killing of infants in its fullest CONTEXT! Most Fundie Preachers on the low end of the IQ scale will tell you that the Bible is full of parables and that it can’t be taken literally... short of seriously! It takes many years of schooling and practice to become a professional preacher! They ALL learn how to cover up, give thumbs down and explain away anything objectionable in the Bible! The Bible is obviously of human origin.  Making a statement that it was dictated by a “God” who claims to be full of wrath all the time is an insult to people with a respectable IQ!<br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us- he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that the enemies of God ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them (Amen?)! The old Bible strategy of birth control is not abortion, but the killing of infants AFTER THEY ARE BORN and before they grow up and become a menace to God’s chosen people developing WMD or what have you that not even God can defeat!  (Judges 1:19)<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus Christ says in his apocalyptic REVELATION for the last days) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Just for the heck of it! No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies! (Amen?!) This time it is Sweet Jesus killing the innocent children to announce his 2nd coming and at the same time to teach everybody in the Churches a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Jesus would be in jail for promoting the KILLING OF CHILDREN to favor a particular religion. That’s why the Preachers are so selective in what they teach from the Bible! They came up with the PRO-LIFE bit on their own to dissociate themselves from this REVELATION, and from the routine slaying of children in the Bible, and what’s even grosser yet about cooking and eating them for dinner! All this forced on God’s chosen people for his pleasure! Christianity is a slaughter house religion. No question about it! The Bible writers were very creative about how to call religious people’s attention!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*Not even the Mafia bosses measure up to this Jesus Christ in the Bible! Christians may expose the Mafia, but they surely LOVE JESUS! And they cover up for him!) <br>  <br>  The story of Jesus was written long after he died (if he ever existed!). He is said to be the greatest religious teacher ever known in the world. Jesus suggested the slaughter by drowning in the middle of the sea of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6). He also suggested the voluntary shedding of offending body parts like an eye, arm, leg or what have you to follow him (Mat 18:8), including male castration (Mat 19:12). Anything to make it into the Kingdom of Heaven! Today no teacher cares to be as great as Jesus was or he/she may end up in jail! Most Christians today don’t pay attention to Jesus Christ’s gory suggestions, but throughout the Christian dominated Dark Ages some prominent clergy persons castrated themselves for the “Kingdom’s sake!” Many “witches” and slaves were abused and killed here in this ONE NATION UNDER GOD, too! (Google “Salem witches” and “castrati” in Wikipedia!) So good luck to all of you Christians in your quest for the truth and intellectual satisfaction… or are you after the peace of mind that only religion can offer? Even Jesus says in perfect King James English, “Thou shalt know the truth and the truth shalt set thee free!”|`|YYbVDcw8aa	everyone needs a hobby.

And usually, those judgements are not correct.  <br>  <br>  I think that people become more beautiful when they are happy inside.  We all know the couple where one is classically attractive and one is not.  The whispers go around about why the attractive person is dating the 'less' attractive one.<br>  <br>  Then you get to know that 'less' attractive person, and wonder why you ever thought that they were not attractive in the first place.<br>  <br>  So, yes, I think that it may be more prevalent.|`|fcdc1e6747dd11145d08d94b00a73ec3aa	Guys like the dumb, easy ones. All guys really want is casual sex.<br>  <br>  My understanding is that intellectual conversation and wit can be found in the company of other men. In most societies of the world, women are conditioned to be stupid, fragile (both emotionally and physically) submissive and dependant on a male companion. Ugly girls, for the most part, must compensate for their lack of looks by acquiring knowledge and competing with men in male-dominated professions in order to find a mate.<br>  <br>  As a university student, I have noted that that as you move away from the engineering faculty and towards humanities, the student body is composed of increasing proportions of girls. blondes and yoga pants (dumb bit.ches don't know sh.it about yoga, really, and to me this is the epitome of sl.ut).<br>  <br>  Its just the way things are; guys feel good being with relatively less intelligent women, and the pretty ones continue to fritter away their meaningless little lives, dating asshole after asshole, blissfully ignorant.<br>  <br>  Society as we know it, is not a perfect meritocracy. Being beautiful ensures greater reward-to-effort ratios than you would ever achieve being a plain-looking person.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Race is hardly ever an issue. Note that all the pretty girls look the same, just different hair/skin/color combinations, of which the first two can easily be changed.

Esto es muy habitual en hombres que se sienten mal con su orientación sexual (egodistónico). Se siente poco hombre, humillado y que no merce ser un hombre, pero le duele este hecho porque no quiere sentirse así y más aún si siente el rechazo de su progenitor. Busca el cari?o paternal.

Reviste formas muy variadas a través de los siglos y las culturas. Su origen psíquico permanece en gran medida inexplicado. Apoyándose en la Sagrada Escritura que los presenta como depravaciones graves, la Tradición ha declarado siempre que "los actos homosexuales son intrínsecamente desordenados". Son contrarios a la ley natural. Cierran el acto sexual al don de la vida. No proceden de una verdadera complementariedad afectiva y sexual. No pueden recibir aprobación en ningún caso.<br>  <br>  2358 Un número apreciable de hombres y mujeres presentan tendencias homosexuales instintivas. No eligen su condición homosexual; ésta constituye para la mayoría de ellos una auténtica prueba. Deben ser acogidos con respeto, compasión y delicadeza. Se evitará, respecto a ellos, todo signo de discriminación injusta. Estas personas están llamadas a realizar la voluntad de Dios en su vida, y, si son cristianas, a unir al sacrificio de la cruz del Se?or las dificultades que pueden encontrar a causa de su condición. <br>  <br>  2359 Las personas homosexuales están llamadas a la castidad. Mediante virtudes de dominio de sí mismo que eduquen la libertad interior, y a veces mediante el apoyo de una amistad desinteresada, de la oración y la gracia sacramental, pueden y deben acercarse gradual y resueltamente a la perfección cristiana.<br>  <br>  Resumen:<br>  <br>  El origen psíquico de la homosexualidad permanece en gran medida inexplicado. <br>  La Sagrada Escritura presenta las prácticas homosexuales como depravaciones graves: Gn 19, 1-29; Rm 1,24-27; 1 Co 6,10; 1 Tm 1,10 <br>  La Tradición ha declarado siempre que "los actos homosexuales son intrínsecamente desordenados" <br>  Son contrarios a la ley natural. <br>  Cierran el acto sexual al don de la vida. <br>  No proceden de una verdadera complementariedad afectiva y sexual. <br>  No pueden recibir aprobación en ningún caso. <br>  Algunos tienen tendencias homosexuales que no han escogido y que son para ellos una prueba. Estas personas están llamadas a 1-Unir sus dificultades al sacrificio de la cruz, 2- Practicar la castidad en continencia y el dominio de si mismos, como todos los cristianos. <br>  Deben ser acogidos con respeto, compasión y delicadeza.|`|44176710570bf732ee4ce304fd6764e3aa	sALIENDO DEL CLOSET NO ARREGLARIA SU VIDA, MAS BIEN TIENE QUE TRBAJARSE CON SIGO MISMO QUE ES Y QUE QUIERE...|`|7c39464103c7509413c4ff26a1c704ecaa	dile que en esta vida lo mas dificil es perdonar,que acuda a su cristo interior y que piense que a el tambien lo crucificaron ,por ignorancia,que cambie de pais ,donde nadie lo conozca y comience una nueva vida de cero ,con el tiempo ,si en verdad lo quiere su padre llegara a comprenderlo y que escuche la cancion de willy collon :"simon" si se siente muy mal.|`|e3331d063914f770bd4b33e09ff6aa48aa	SI pobre, lo que dijo su papa es algo muy malo por ser gay no pierde la dignidad pero si es ratero o narco si y hasta es ilegal , pero si tu le das tu apoyo a lo mejor deje de empeorar su situaciòn y no pasaria nada mas horrible<br>  y seria el gay normal y a mucha honra que quiere ser|`|fd254f9bc15ea9d73ae9bcf0d697ce86aa	pues segun lo que cuentas, salir del closet no va a cambiarle la vida magicamente, tiene que recuperar su autoestima y ese seria el primer paso para lograr, reforzar su propia identidad y quererse como es
wkKJpCwRaa	I agree with you, because many of us work damn hard for what we do. Sometimes, though things don't go as well as we would like them to be. Just because you are on welfare or have government assistance, that does not mean that you are less of a person and that you don't work hard. Sometimes things in this life take a downturn and it's hard to get back up. Blacks as a whole, for damn sure aren't lazy, there are too many Black acheivers beyond belief who can prove that! <br>  <br>  Yes, they are basically just talking out of their @sses because all they are talking is a whole bunch of sh*t!|`|8fyEZtyNaa	im thinking, if they are observing these behaviors, then they must be lazy themselves, because you have to have no life to notice something...and to believe what dummie white nationalists say.|`|92iuiuZKaa	Yes for the most part!<br>  <br>  edit @Kyle S- where do you live?|`|hQWucH5uaa	Here are some facts:<br>  <br>  FBI statistics: Black Americans are 13% of the U.S. population but cause 55% of the crime.  And 77% of all black Americans are on some kind of assistance (welfare, food-stamps, SSAN checks, etc.).<br>  <br>  It would seem that a majority of black Americans are very industrious in commiting crimes.  This takes away from the minority of black Americans breaking their backs to earn an honest living.<br>  <br>  Obviously black people are not lazy the way they kill each other, and they should channel some of that criminal energy into getting and keeping a job.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	Don't let it bug you.  It's just a throwback from an earlier time before civil rights and during civil rights movement. They just didn't want to give African American people the same rights and jobs as everyone (white) else.  So, they labeled them as lazy.  Funny how they weren't too lazy to work the fields etc. But, it's been handed down from racist to racist and unfortunately we are still stuck with this ignorant stereotype today.<br>  <br>  Desk, that may be the most ignorant thing I've heard on here!|`|8MzVCzi0aa	tiffany W said it well|`|t6sDVUI4aa	The general perception where I live is that there are the criminal black people and the normal black people. The distaste for black people is generally directed toward the criminals and the others are well liked by the rest of the community. I guess it boils down to, do you want to integrate with the rest of America or do you want to cause trouble and be ousted. Personally I have a great idea how about we judge people by the measure of their achievements and the weight of their character? No equal opportunity laws, no entitlements save to pay commensurate with your work. How about achievements and reputation be the determining factor?

545152fef00f40453a0e1246e3ab0467aa	Sobre la pregunta, no creo que la influencia de Spinoza sobre Hegel y Marx haya sido determinante en la racionalización determinista de sus estudios. Ciertamente el discurso alemán es el que históricamente ha privado en occidente,  y si no, no ha sido más que su reflejo, toda vez que el sintetizador entre el racionalismo y el empirismo es Kant, luego viene el idealismo de Hegel, el socialismo científico de Marx; contrario a Hegel está Schopenhauer, luego Nietzsche, Husserl, Heiddeger, la escuela de Frankfurt, Foucault y hasta J. Derrida. <br>  <br>  Incluso entre la visión de Hegel y Marx existen algunas diferencias, más allá de que este último fue quien terminó por ordenar las ideas hegelianas, ya que la dialéctica en Hegel era de corte idealista mientras que la de Marx es materialista.. aunque en el fondo, creo que efectivamente ambos siguen el mismo determinismo. Simples vericuetos en su estudio. <br>  <br>  Por otro lado cari?o, sobre "la libertad no es más que la necesidad comprendida", a pesar de parecer evidente o lógica la expresión, el problema es que en el pensamiento de Spinoza esta libertad está supeditada a la razón como fruto del conocimiento y, en congruencia, de la comprensión de las necesidades; esto marca un límite porque nuestras propias necesidades son naturales, más no racionales. Spinoza, por desgracia, no advirtió que la capacidad para apreciar ello es una expresión de la forma fundamental de nuestro pensamiento, sin la cual el propio pensamiento no podría existir... su aplicación es más científica. Aún así, creo que en cierto sentido la libertad sí podría estar supeditada a la razón, más en términos de elección y conocimiento de causa, como lo propone el sociólogo Wright Mills... <br>  <br>  En fin, recibe un beso.|`|7d88bafa5230a7f8cde4018a2b74bc82aa	?Estudias filosofía? ?O tal vez ciencias políticas?<br>  Muy interesante tu pregunta.<br>  Lo que es evidente es que eres ideal.|`|f1966386ca67ac194d932290c30f3b04aa	No veo conexión entre Spinoza y Marx o Hegel.<br>  Aunque Spnizosa también es judío, esta ligado más a Descartes y, al panteísmo. Sobre la libertad que hablas tu se basa en los tres grados de conocimiento y, su determinismo no parece relacionarse con el determinismo de Hegel o Marx.<br>  La filosofía de la ex-URSS lo consideraba un materialista más profundo que Descartes, pero como consideraba que esa libertad sólo correspondía a los sabios y no a la masa y por eso era antihistórica. A su vez parecía partidario de Hobbes menos en la cuestión social que creía en un gobierno democrático y no monárquico.

f7ez5gh9aa	Avoir des croyances religieuse n'est pas mauvais en soi. Le problème , c'est l'orgueil des hommes qui leur souffle à l'oreille que leur religion est la meilleure et que tous ceux qui appartiennent à d'autres obédience sont voués à l'enfer et je ne sais encore quelles sottises . La religion pourrait etre une bonne chose si elle ne subissait pas les déformations créées par les dominateurs qui s'en emparent pour gouverner le bétail humain.Les principes moraux de toute religion sont bons et destinés à mettre un peu d'ordre dans le chaos des passions humaines mais la religion est aussi un terrible instrument de Pouvoir , et ceux qui n'ont pas de discernement, de force intérieure, sont  MANIPULES par les religions . Je ne vise personne mais suivez mon regard. Nous autres catholiques (puisque la France est tout de meme un pays ou cette religion s'est épanouie) nous avons commis l'Inquisition, les saint Barthélémy et massacre des Cathares e'tc..

En The New Encyclop?dia Britannica se dice que “por lo que los eruditos han descubierto, en ningún lugar y en ninguna época ha existido un pueblo que no?fuese, en cierto sentido, religioso”. Desde el mismo comienzo de la humanidad, el hombre y la mujer veían lógico adorar a su Creador. Lo consideraban la Autoridad que podía darles dirección y consejo. Por consiguiente, el origen de la religión en la Tierra coincidió con la creación de Adán. Según la cronología bíblica, eso ocurrió en el a?o 4026 a.?E.C.<br>  En The Encyclopedia of Religion se dice que casi todas las religiones tienen ciertas creencias que, aunque difieran en los detalles, son sorprendentemente similares. Por ejemplo: creen que la humanidad cayó de una posición original de favor divino, que la muerte no?es natural y que para recuperar el favor divino, se necesita un sacrificio. Esta poderosa evidencia circunstancial muestra que todas las religiones de hoy tienen un origen común.<br>  <br>  La Biblia explica lo que sucedió. Nos dice que la primera pareja humana rechazó la dirección de Dios y buscó dirección y consejo en otra fuente. Aunque, por lo visto, no?sabían de la existencia de Satanás y de su rebelión contra Dios, adoptaron un proceder de independencia y siguieron el consejo de una criatura, representada por la serpiente, en vez del consejo del Creador. Más tarde, la Biblia reveló que quien verdaderamente habló tras la fachada enga?osa de la serpiente fue Satanás. (Génesis 2:16–3:24; Revelación 12:9.)<br>  <br>  El hombre dejó de someterse a la gobernación teocrática y estableció sus propias normas tocante a lo bueno y lo malo. Por su derrotero de independencia, Adán y Eva iniciaron a la humanidad en un proceder que resultaría en muchas religiones diferentes, todas las cuales constituirían adoración falsa, en contraste con la adoración verdadera practicada por los fieles de Dios a través de toda la historia. Directa o indirectamente, la adoración falsa ha ido dirigida a Satanás, el gran Adversario. Por eso, el apóstol Pablo pudo escribir: “Las cosas que las naciones sacrifican, a demonios las sacrifican, y no?a Dios; y no?quiero que ustedes se hagan partícipes con los demonios”. Y luego mostró que solo hay dos formas de adoración: “No pueden estar bebiendo la copa de Dios y la copa de demonios; no?pueden estar participando de ‘la mesa de Dios’ y de la mesa de demonios”. (1?Corintios 10:20,?21.)<br>  <br>  De modo que la rebelión de Adán inició una segunda forma de adoración, una en la que se ponía a la criatura por delante del Creador. Y el verdadero patrocinador de esta nueva religión era el ser que acababa de autonombrarse “dios”: Satanás el Diablo. (2?Corintios 4:4; 1?Juan 5:19.)<br>  <br>  Caín y Abel, los dos primeros hijos de Adán y Eva, ofrecieron sacrificios al Creador, lo que indica que ambos tenían inclinaciones religiosas. No?obstante, el giro que después tomaron los acontecimientos reveló que no?estaban unidos en el aspecto religioso. Esto se puso de manifiesto cuando aún no?habían transcurrido ciento treinta a?os de historia humana. Fue con ocasión de un sacrificio presentado por Abel y que el Creador aceptó, en contraste con el de Caín, que fue rechazado. Obviamente, Dios no?estaba dispuesto a aceptar cualquier religión personal. Este hecho encolerizó a Caín y le incitó a asesinar a su hermano. (Génesis 4:1-12; 1?Juan 3:12.)<br>  <br>  Por primera vez en la historia del hombre, el odio religioso manchó la tierra de sangre inocente. Aquella no?sería la última vez. “Probablemente, la mitad de las guerras, o más, que se están peleando alrededor del mundo son conflictos claramente religiosos o tienen que ver con disputas religiosas”, comentó no?hace mucho un columnista de un periódico.<br>  <br>  En los días de Enós, sobrino de Caín y Abel, “se dio comienzo a invocar el nombre de Jehová”. (Génesis 4:26.) Como Abel ya había dado comienzo a invocar el nombre de Dios con fe anteriormente, se entiende que este posterior “invocar el nombre de Jehová” significa que la gente comenzó a profanar o degradar este nombre. Se trataba claramente de un caso de hipocresía religiosa.<br>  <br>  El Targum judío de Jerusalén parafrasea estas palabras del siguiente modo: “Esa fue la generación en cuyos días empezaron a errar y a hacerse ídolos, y apodaron a sus ídolos con el nombre de la Palabra del Se?or”. La religión falsa siempre se ha caracterizado por la idolatría y la presunción de representar a Dios.|`|d22af4189b63f92e8fd680c1eb86bc51aa	EL HOMBRE|`|ec5b5cd29d9e414da3cd0fcefd0a6534aa	El hombre porque Jesús vino a traernos la salvación y una forma de vida, no un a religión|`|129cbc951f44fd0d65548dd0af11ea81aa	DESPUES DEL DILUVIO PASARON muchos a?os. Los hijos de Noé tuvieron muchos hijos. Y sus hijos crecieron y tuvieron más hijos. Pronto hubo mucha gente en la TierrA Una de estas personas fue un bisnieto de Noé llamado Nemrod. él era malo y cazaba y mataba animales y hombres. Nemrod también se hizo rey para gobernar a otras personas. A Dios no?le gustaba Nemrod. Toda la gente de aquel tiempo hablaba un solo lenguaje. Nemrod quería mantenerlos juntos para él poder gobernarlos. Por eso, ?sabes lo que hizo? Les dijo que hicieran una ciudad y una gran torre en ella. En la lámina los ves haciendo ladrillos. A Jehová Dios no?le agradó este edificio. él quería que la gente se fuera de allí y viviera por toda la Tierra. Pero ellos dijeron: ‘?Vamos! Hagamos una ciudad y una torre tan alta que su parte de arriba llegue a los cielos. ?Entonces seremos famosos!’ Querían honor para sí, no?para Dios. Por eso Dios hizo que la gente dejara de hacer la torre. ?Sabes cómo lo hizo? Hizo que de repente las personas hablaran diferentes lenguajes, en vez de uno solo. Ya no?se entendían los unos a los otros. Por eso su ciudad llegó a llamarse Babel, o Babilonia, que quiere decir “Confusión.”<br>  Ahora la gente empezó a irse de Babel. Los grupos que hablaban el mismo lenguaje se fueron a vivir juntos en otras partes de la Tierra.<br>  p0r alli empezo todo<br>  tambien que a lo largo del tiempo la jente empezo a tener la necesidad de creeer en un Dios y muchas personas se aprovecharon de ello e inventaron muchos dioses y alle religiones te acuerda la historia de moises donde la jente se hizo un cordero de oro para adorar porque? porque creia que Dios los habia abandonado y tenian la necesidad de confiar en alguien que segun ellos mas poderosos que ellos y vino un hombre e invento ese cordero asi es todo y a lo largo del siblo hay mas de 10millones de religiones pero no todos llegan alDios verdadero y hay que tener cuidado.<br>  hay muchos que se aprovechan en la necesidad de la jente e inventan milagros e imagenes para su adoracion y ganar plata hasta el ocultismo( leer el taro) eso es una religion tambien<br>  pero la pregunta ahora es<br>  COMO CONSEGUIR LA RELIGION VERDADERA?|`|211dd64874d5e8d6bfe31eb469be604eaa	LA religion verdadera que fundo Cristo era necesario para interceder favor para con nosotros.<br>  <br>  Ahora bien las religiones apartir de esta son todas productos del genio del diablo para confundir mas a la gente y llevarla con doctrinas mentirosas fuera de la verdad de Dios.<br>  <br>  Ciao x aura|`|4f5c80fe17f2d5f1de74aaacada90ce3aa	hola buneo filosoficamente la religion nacio cunado el hombre comenzo a crear dioses por los sucesos sin explicacion que no habia en la antiguedad un ejemplo (bueno se puede decir con los truenos ellos pensaban que alguien los estaba castigando o advirtiendo de algo ) o ( es el caso de los terremotos ellos pensaban que alguien superior a ellos hacia temblar la tierra y asi multitud de mitos y de Dioses Religiones|`|5455b81b7d96f1a24e77205f5db96db1aa	gente con mentalidad empresarial...|`|654a36fcf327aa9b8423c8f5032bd091aa	Preguntemos si hoy en día es posible formar una religión con un libro nuevo que se diga que viene de Dios?.<br>  La respuesta es NO, simplemente por la inteligencia, la Libertad, y el amor que ha desarrollado el ser humano.<br>  Las religiones han sido creadas por el hombre, por la necesidad de saber que hay antes del nacimiento y que hay después de la muerte, el inconveniente es que cada religión se a quedado estancada en el tiempo y no a evolucionado a la par con el ser humano, un ejemplo son los cristianos que increíblemente siguen creyendo en cosas que se escribieron hace mas de 2000 a?os.|`|779fa66935209902ea50238b48a79e28aa	Estoy de acuerdo con la primera q respondio fue el HOMBRE, desde un pricipio Dios Intauró una sola religion y era la verdadera y pura, pero cuando llega Jesus y el pasar de los a?os el hombre se corrompe y lo mismo ocurre con sus creencias y principios, naciendo mas y mas religiones y las constumbres de un hombre corrompido.|`|9fae7108536ea90e76dd70a94de12048aa	Los profetas y sus secuaces.<br>  Por ejemplo Cristo y sus evangelistas,Mahoma y el secretario que iba escribiendo lo que hacia,etc.<br>  Siempre tiene que haber un teorico y el que redacte la teoria.|`|a14c497f259e212762edecb5af3a805eaa	Por religión yo entiendo todos los esfuerzos que el hombre hace para ir al cielo, y que obviamente ninguna llegarán, siendo esto una obra tan ridícula como levantar una torre hasta el cielo. El creador de la religión es el diablo, es la obra maestra de satanás, perfecta para enga?ar a las personas y hacer que se auto justifiquen en sus justicias, (entiéndase rituales) y no en la justicia de Dios. Les hace creer, que por cumplir con los requisitos de una denominación ya están mas cerca de Dios, pero lo único que la religión hace es formar monstruos como Caín, el cual ofrecía sacrificios a Dios, pero aborrecía a su hermano, al grado de llegar a matarlo.  Hoy en día las religiones no son mas que mercados de almas como bien dijo Pedro y Pablo, harán mercadería de vosotros (2 Pedro 2:3) y por lucro predicarán el evangelio (2 Corintios 2:17) (medrar). La religión nada tiene que ver con Dios.  Todas asumen tener la verdad y ofrecen un camino mas fácil para ir al cielo, que el camino angosto que marca la biblia, se basan en doctrinas creadas por el hombre y no en la biblia y cuando la citan, por lo general la tuercen conforme a sus herejías. Obviamente, nadie que pertenezca a ellas se salvará puesto que Dios nunca trajo este camino.|`|af9cc003a0d5895b20f66c160901037baa	POR LA NECESAD DEL HOMBRE POR QUERER IMPONER LO QUE LE NACE DE SU COCHINO CORAZON Y NO LO QUE MANDA DIOS|`|d9590ea0405bfd744d3dbc20256410a5aa	tus antepasados.<br>  y ?porque lo habran hecho?<br>  de seguro pensaron que tu nacerias y quisieron heredarte algo mejor,?quien sabe?<br>  pero esta bien ?o no?

Was ist mit den vielen Jugendlichen, die z.B. gemeinnützig t?tig sind? über diese wird selten oder gar nicht berichtet. Fazit: Es hei?t immer - die schlechte Jugend von heute. Natürlich ist die Moral im laufe der Jahre sehr verloren gegangen und die Gewalt ist auch deutlich h?her geworden. Aber ich sehe dies nicht als "Jugendgeneration". Es gibt zum Glück immer noch genug Menschen (und das sind die Jugendlichen natürlich auch), die mit beiden Beinen fest auf der Erde stehen.

Il rencontre des problèmes, mais il est heureux d’utiliser ses capacités mentales et physiques pour les résoudre. Il est également doté d’un sens moral qui lui permet de déterminer ce qui est bon ou mauvais, d’une conscience qui le travaille lorsqu’il s’écarte de la voie droite.

Ta machine peut être aussi puissante en matière de réflexion et de puissance de calcul, elle ne saura jamais qu'elle vit (à supposer, bien s?r, que tu arrives à la faire "vivre" au sens physiologique du terme) et, bien qu'on puisse s'émerveiller devant les capacités de réflexion et d'analyse de ta machine, elle ne fera rien d'autre que ce pour quoi elle a été con?ue.<br>  Un exemple relativement basique de ceci est le jeu d'échecs: cela fait longtemps que c'est un ordinateur qui est le "vrai" champion du monde à ce jeu, mais il n'en n'a aucune conscience, pas plus qu'il ne sait qu'il joue. Il ne fait que raisonner en "1-0" et, même en mode quantique, ce fameux système binaire est à la base du fonctionnement de n'importe quel ordinateur (il est simplement démultiplié en fonction du nombre d'électrons susceptibles de se trouver dans un état ou dans un autre).<br>  Je t'accorde cependant que l'homme crée du vivant, mais à partir de choses déja vivantes (de nouvelles espèces d'animaux ou de plantes, par croisement, greffe ou modification du patrimoine génétique) mais les résultats probants sont assez limités.<br>  Quand aux religions, elles n'ont pas besoin de ?a pour "pleurer leurs pertes", leur non-adaptation aux questions du monde moderne suffit à les entrainer elles-mêmes vers leur déclin.|`|34a319d6d77e1619f94240a98922c401aa	Qu'est ce qui va remplacer la religion comme balise pour les valeurs?

Le contre exemple classique etant:<br>  si je cree un algorytme qui verifie si un autre algo tourne en boucle et aue je le fait agir sur lui meme, alors il tournera en boucle...<br>  <br>  Je suis extremement curieux de savoir comment resoudre ce probleme avec de la puissance de calcul. car si un algo tourne en boucle, meme en allant plus vite, ca ne change rien...?<br>  <br>  Bien sur j'ai entendu parler de la modelisations basees sur la decompositions en processus tres simples (ex: une fournis est bete une fourmiliere non, la comlexification se fait seule).<br>  <br>  penses-tu vraiment que cette voie menera a une IA ?<br>  <br>  De toute maniere, a partir du moment ou une IA sera cree, le compte a rebour commencera avant la fin de l'humanitee: la theorie de la singularitee technologique te dit qu'en moins de 3 ans tu verra apparaitre de intelligences INFINIMENT superieures a celles de l'homme... des sorte de supra consciences... ce sera alors "la fin de l'histoire" la fin de l;humanitee... je dois avouer que cette perspective me fait pas mal flipper moi...<br>  <br>  certains prenne ce projet tres a coeur. Il existe un institut de la singularite dont le but est de creer le plus rapidement possible une IA "amicale"...<br>  <br>  quand aux religions... soit elles adopterons ces supra consiences comme dieu, soit elles nierons tout simplement l'evidence et se renfermerons dans leur dogmes (evolution ?)<br>  <br>  flippant...<br>  <br>  @ pretresse<br>  ouais d'accord... je pensais a une boucle infinie qui se repete DE LA MEME MANIERE car c'aest cela qu'on appel boucle infinie en fait non. Le programme bug parce qu'il se bloaue sur un element non prevu ou qu'il tourne en rond. Si tu prends un ecran de veille, certe c'est une boucle infinie (si tu n'y touche pas) mais elle ne se repete jamais de la meme manier a cause d'un generateur aleatoire (vraiment aleatoire d'ailleur ?) ou autre... maintenant, je ne suis pas non plus un specialiste du sujet comme toi, je voudrais juste comprendre comment tu resouds ce probleme car pour moi je ne pense pas qu'il sagit uniquement d'un probleme de puissance de calcul (un simple ordinateur actuel prends deja bien plus de "decisions" par seconde qu'un cerveau humain)<br>  <br>  @@ interessant... merci|`|kkartMrCaa	Je pense déjà que les religions sont déjà en crise grave !<br>  <br>  plus beaucoup de monde ne reconnais les valeurs véhiculées comme bonne...et en plus, on s'appuie sur des excuzes bidonc pour les contredire : "c'est le responsable de l'inquisition, la charia, nianianiani" : ?a c'est l'oeuvre de l'homme et de son interprétation. <br>  <br>  désolé d'avoir fait dévier ta question...|`|zhob6ey6aa	D'un premier élan je te répondrais : Deux plans différents puisque l'un est du domaine du "matériel" et l'autre du "spirituel". <br>  <br>  Mais en fait je ne pense pas que la physique quantique soit l'outil rêvé pour argumenter la réalité matérielle. <br>  En fait elle révolutionne la physique (l'étude des propriétés de la matière) dans une direction inattendue : "la physique n'est peut être pas là pour nous parler de la réalité matérielle; le monde qu'elle décrit n'est peut-être qu'une gigantesque hallucination". En faisant cours : la réalité de ce que nous percevons n'est plus du tout une certitude. Tout est à revoir sous un nouvel angle : l'espace temps, la relativité d'Einstein...<br>  <br>  Pour l'intelligence artificielle je n'ose pas m'aventurer sur un domaine que ne connais pas, je sais qu'il y a des travaux sur ce qui est décrit comme des "automates cellulaires" mais pas grand chose d'autre ... désolé .<br>  <br>  Pour ma part la révolution de la physique par la physique quantique n'est qu'une étape de plus  qui devrait  nous conforter dans plus  d'humilité. <br>  <br>  Les réalités scientifiques d'hier ne sont pas celles d'aujourd'hui et celles d'aujourd'hui ne sont pas celles de demain, chacune ajoutant à la précédente.... tiens c'est bizarre on à l'impression de parler de l'évolution des religions !!<br>  Je tiens donc à te rassurer : ne t'inquiéte pas pour le domaine spirituel

I know it's just beginning, but so far they've handled it well. She's having to relearn things as a woman that she thought she knew as a man. Next week, she'll be attending a transgender support group and Jennifer Finney Boylan (the author of She's Not There: A Life in Two Genders) will be guest-starring in the scene. Along with her, other real transgendered people will be guest-starring and telling their own stories, no scripts. Taking a well-known member of the transgender community, along with other transgendered people, and putting them in the scene, as well as with the GLAD involvement in the entire storyline, has worked out really well.|`|HO5Xs0Hdaa	I don't know too much about the transgendered to know how accurate this particular story line is, but I watch this show regularly, and they are usually pretty right on when it comes to things like this.  Example being, Lilly Montgomery and her Autism.  They do a pretty accurate job on that character, and the actress who plays her does a phenomenal job on the role, making it even more convincing.
e1a1f381a6a593980ed750f67bf70f11aa	Se debe al machismo y al bajo nivel educativo de buena parte de la población mexicana. El hombre mexicano siente un deseo muy fuerte de someter sexualmente a otros machos, lo cual hace en forma verbal. Este comportamiento se observa también en primates como los chimpances y los bonovos, donde el macho dominante somete sexualmente a los machos inferiores y con ello lográ también apropiarse de las hembras. A esta actitud hay que agregar también la existencia de una homosexualidad reprimida en muchos machos mexicanos, la cual se manifiesta en estos "albures".|`|124ad591f989243de5d0d45655b63988aa	No se si ganen puntos o no, necesariamente el hablar el doble sentido no quiere decir que se estan mofando de alguien, tambien es una forma de comunicacion tradicional que se utiliza en Mexico y que es parte de nuestra cultura ademas si sabes de doble sentido puedes divertirte mucho y no necesariamente ofendiendo a alguin ya que puedes hablar en doble sentido divirtiendote y a parte alburear a alguien de mala fe, el problema radica que cuando alguin no entiende ninguna de las dos formas de expresion por lo regular se siente ofendido. <br>  <br>  saludos|`|a3660ab7a89292e304e3c76c5d07dc4eaa	LA BERDA NO LO ZE|`|bfb51f18312f7246cfc5399cd15c7a64aa	Es parte del caló mexicano, a veces es divertido por que agarras a la otra persona desprevenida, son modismos del país, mi cu?ada cuando llego de Venezuela fué nuestra comidilla hasta que los comenzó a entender, ahora es ella quien nos alburea a nosotros.|`|e3331d063914f770bd4b33e09ff6aa48aa	a mi no me agradan los albures pero bueno es excelente tu observacion de que no todos los mexicanos los decimos|`|ba158a735c2df8a00ed4bd89e49348d7aa	a mi no...........

Cuando El vino a la tierra fué por causa de nosotros, para rescatarnos de toda una vida separada de Dios y las consecuencias que esto trae. Cuando terminó su misión, regresó a la diestra del Padre, de donde mismo había descendido. Pero su visión de redimirnos del pecado y de la muerte, fué plasmado en sus doce discípulos quienes transmitieron este mensaje que ha sido aceptado por muchos a travéz de las épocas y, quienes creemos en él, le  hemos aceptado como nuestro único y suficiente Salvador. <br>  <br>  Saludos, te invito a que reflexiones en esto.|`|cd20404d94c92af5d8e23e5db725f05daa	Despues haber resucitado permaneció entre nosotros por cuarenta dias, y después subió al cielo en cuerpo y alma, nunca volvió a morir.

Living in Los Angeles can be very difficult if you don't make a certain income because houses and rent especially DO NOT come cheap and the cost of living is higher, and same for NYC (if not worse), so economics come into mind as well. Overall, what I am trying is that the total package matters, not just being a gentleman- motivation, drive, ambition, etc. are important as well.

Dios los expulsó del Paraíso terrenal como castigo a su desobediencia y para que no pudieran comer del árbol de la vida. También condenó a la serpiente.

2afac27ff6915d8a77afda56d76bfb01aa	i do think so. especially kids these days.  i can't believe how disrespectful they are to their parents.  i see it happening in public all the time and wonder why these parents are letting their kids get away with it.   children need discipline, and discipline begins at home.  parents need to take charge again and stop letting the government interfere.  when i was a kid and i did something wrong i was spanked as a toddler and beat as a teenager until i got the rules right.  i did the same to my children and believe me, we are better off for it.  society would thank me for disciplining my children and not leaving it up to the taxpayers to foot the bill when they get put away for crimes they might have otherwise committed.  i'm not saying beat your kids, but parents have to take charge and mean it and keep consistent when they tell their children what to do, where to go, what to wear, and who to hang with.  i don't give a crap if the kids cry and throw a tantrum, it's worth it in the long run to show them who is really boss, and who's really in charge of the family.  children need to be put in their place and taught responsibly before they earn freedom such as a driver's license.  we need to teach our children to be responsible adults and make responsible decisions.|`|2208c2dae4b48648f8b95f21a760a999aa	It seems that way partly because we see it on T.V. before the car hits the pole. Before the bullet leaves the gun.etc. If you think it has changed all that much ask an old cop who worked in the cities in the 60s. There are more people and technology so that we just know a lot more about it too. Yes I think it's worse too but not as much as it seems.|`|d48c53e33918342b9f1a984b497e364aaa	Don't be sad.  Think of medeival times.  Look at all the history you can read about- it's full of violence, wars, injustice, drugs.  Sadly it is a hard part of human nature to be reconciled with.  Hopefully we can minimize it, and be thankful for the moments of peace we are granted.

C'est comme pour les agissements des nazis, les allemands d'aujourdh'ui n'en sont pas plus responsables, mais cela a eu lieu.<br>  <br>  Moi, tant que les droits des femmes seront dans ce pays ce qu'ils sont actuellement, jamais je ne voterais pour l'adhésion à l'Europe.

SC5t5cUVaa	This may work for your school?!?!<br>  <br>  How about a lip gloss fund raiser! Have fun raising funds!<br>  <br>  I have used this before to help a friend of mine raise money for her local Autism Group.<br>  <br>  I am an Arbonne Consultant and I give my retail profit back to the fundraiser. Arbonne has these 6 great lip glosses that cost $10.00 USD Retail. I also include Arbonne Lip Saver for the guys and the gals.(SPF8 Chapstick). Priced at $8.00 US. <br>  <br>  This makes the fund raiser fun and simple. Just 7 products and each sold earns $3 for the fundraising cause. I also work into the program rewards for each of the sellers if they reach certain sales goals. <br>  <br>  Where do you live? Arbonne can be sold out of the US, Canada, UK, and Australia. So this should work for any of these locations or if you live another place, I just need to look at the shipping cost of the products.<br>  <br>  Anyway it is very fun and really can create a nice amount of money for the cause.<br>  <br>  Example: 20 Members in a group with a goal to sell 30 each.<br>  <br>  20 Members each sell 30 Lip Gloss = 600 Sold        <br>  600 x $3.00 = $1800.00 to the Fundraiser<br>  ($3.00 earned for each sold)<br>  <br>  Plus each member that can sell 30 or more will get $50.00 in Arbonne Products Free as a bonus. Arbonne has over 400 products for all ages from baby to grandparent.<br>  <br>  It is easy to sell. Great colors and many ladies will buy 2 different colors or one lip gloss and the lip saver.<br>  <br>  I can also customize a fundraising program for your group.   So many products it is very easy to find a program that can work for your group.  <br>  <br>  Take a look at my web site, link below, to see an example of how purchases over a year can raise funds for a cause.  Your group can make money on all orders purchased through my Arbonne Business and referred by your group.  It can really add up.  <br>  <br>  Email me through my profile or from my web site if you would like more information.<br>  <br>  Take care, <br>  Karen|`|mIVSQLx3aa	Very sorry, but in the economic climate right now, I'm leaving all that to the government. I have enough worries of my own already without taking on a cause over which I have absolutely no concern and which could mainly have been prevented by young people in 'educated' countries thinking before they had sex and the big charities sending large packs of condoms out to the more backward parts of the world where all they do is breed without any thought as to how they will keep their offspring.<br>  No doubt this will earn dozens of thumbs down from all the regulars but take my word for it, like it or not, I'm speaking for thousands of others here!

nySRQ8Tmaa	One of the most important things in using any stone in healing is that it be completely natural and untreated.  Many stones for sale in the marketplace have been heat or chemically treated to enhance color and amethyst is no exception.  These treatments hamper the natural color vibrations of the stone and lessen its effectiveness.|`|tYqUutidaa	Amethyst is known as "Nature's Tranquilizer" because of its healing and calming properties. It also used for deepening awareness and raising consciousness and is associated with the third eye. Amethyst can enhance mental strength, stability and vigor. Physically, it works on the central nervous system and any type of chronic pain. It reportedly brings body systems into balance, from digestion to blood sugar.

Znt1bX6saa	Have you considered the possibility that you have out grown the common mentality that is surrounding you? it is possible to be smarter and more socially evolved than your peers. the best thing to do now is to try to temper your intelligence with wisdom. the people that surround you can also be directed. insted of hating their narrow mindedness find ways to channel their attention to the benifit of the community...you might even find benifits in the most unlikely people|`|XaHeKtjSaa	Personally I think that you should grow up first and overrun your own mentality, which by the way might be the true problem here. Did you ever consider the fact that the problem inhere is actually you. When you piss in the air-you become the one who is getting wet. Therefore, I strongly recommend you to look yourself in the mirror and have a second thought about your surroundings and people you deal with?

Not us.  We judge with our eyes and other senses and God actually sees into hearts and has told me many times in His word that only He can judge.  Heck people aren't even capable of listening to what others say but He is and does.  He listens to all of us and our thoughts.  We rarely listen.  We are almost incapable of any communication as our main goal is to have our desires realized.  Saddam is a perfect example of how we only want our own way and I'll bet He never listened to anyone but himself.  He had no problem judging others and killing them.  Why would I want to be like him and do God's job for Him.  I believe God is capable and willing to met out His own justice and just do not believe that flawed humans are.|`|d262055efbf6ec7fa69965f63445f9c2aa	Regardless of whether or not he was deserving of death, the manner in which it is handled makes a big difference.  There are still people who loved him.  For instance, I read that he has a daughter.  How would you feel if you did something deserving of the death penalty, after which your family and friends saw that the world was rejoicing over it and a video of your death was being viewed on the internet?  Additionally, these photos and videos will no doubt cause serious problems with trying to bring about even a small amount of peace.  It has infuriated Saddam's supporters and that will probably lead to more attacks and violence.  As the saying goes, two wrongs don't make a right.  Remember the golden rule - treat others as you would want to be treated.  Saddam may not have followed that rule, but it does not release us from our obligations to do so.  I can't speak for any other religion, but a Christian is to love even their enemies.

AA10247008	Styria is province in southeastern Austria so Styria has the same Austian cuisine in general:<br>  Austrian cuisine is drawn from the various cultures that once composed the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Specialties vary by region, but include traditional dishes such as Wiener Schnitzel (breaded veal cutlet), Kn?del (moist potato dumplings), and goulash. Pastries and cakes, such as Sachertorte (a rich chocolate cake with apricot jam and chocolate icing), are also extremely popular. Beer and wine are both produced in Austria.<br>  <br>  A typical day begins with a light breakfast of coffee or hot chocolate, rolls, bread, and jam or marmalade. There are numerous sausage stands in cities, and shoppers may buy sausages to eat as a snack between meals, often in the late morning. Traditionally the main meal is in the middle of the day, but for families in which both parents work outside the home, the evening meal is often the main one. Families try to eat at least one meal together each day. Whether at midday or in the evening, the main meal may include soup, meat with potatoes or pasta, vegetables, a salad, and often dessert (such as a homemade pastry). Austrians eat a wide variety of meat, including Rindfleisch (beef), Schweinefleisch (pork), Huhn (chicken), Wurst (sausage), Kalbfleisch (veal), and Wild (venison).<br>  <br>  Jause (afternoon tea), which is less common today, might include sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. If the main meal is eaten at midday, families have Nachtmahl (supper) in the evening. This generally includes cold cuts of meat, eggs, cheese, rye or another type of bread, and a salad. Goulash or hot sausages may be eaten at the midday or evening meal.<br>  <br>  Austrians, like other Europeans, eat with the fork in their left hand and knife in their right, both when cutting food and eating. Guests will almost always be offered second helpings, but no offense will be caused by declining with a polite Danke, nein (“Thank you, no”).<br>  <br>  If you want infos about Syria, I can help too :D|`|f6bbe9997f6e8ef696cc2a8491dc39fcaa	I would imagaine they eat a lot of Austrian food - lots of cabbage and sausages!|`|7kLtdQe4aa	the kind u fuckin put in ur mouth and chew up *****!!!!

El buscar a Dios y conocerlo es vital, mira como lo dijo Jesús: "Esto significa vida eterna, el que esten adquiriendo conocimiento de ti, el único Dios verdadero, y de aquel a quien tú enviaste, Jesucristo." (Juan 17:3); asi que conocer a Dios y a Cristo te reportará vida eterna. Y no hay forma de conocer a Dios y a su hijo si no es por medio de su palabra, la biblia. Es la única forma de conocerlos, saber cómo piensan, dónde están, qué hacen por la humanidad OBEDIENTE, qué va a suceder en el futuro y cómo ponerse de su lado antes de que sea tarde. (Sofonias 1:18) Personalmente te felicito y no te queden dudas de que Dios debe ocupar el primer lugar en tu vida, como lo dijo Cristo: "él le dijo: tienes que amar a Jehová tu Dios con todo tu corazón y con toda tu alma y con toda tu mente." (Mateo 22:37) Ese es el primer y mas importante mandamiento.

Para desenredar la situación, Enrique VIII consiguió que la Cámara de los Lores aprobara el nombramiento del rey como jefe supremo de la iglesia de Inglaterra "en cuanto lo permita la ley de Cristo". Fue el primer paso para constituir una Iglesia nacional sin romper definitivamente con Roma. La independencia judicial y fiscal vendrían a corroborar ese proceso y a forzar también las negociaciones con el Papado para conseguir la nulidad. En mayo de 1533 el arzobispo de Canterbury invalida el matrimonio regio y legaliza la nueva unión del monarca con Ana Bolena. El Papa excomulga a Enrique VIII. La respuesta real es votar y aprobar en el Parlamento, en noviembre de 1534, el "Acta de Supremacía", que, sin la cláusula que la condicionaba a la ley de Cristo, otorga al rey amplios poderes religiosos y eclesiales: gobierno de la Iglesia de Inglaterra, derecho de excomunión y de persecución y castigo de las herejías. La ruptura se había consumado políticamente. Se admitía sin más la superioridad real sobre el Papa.

Are you satisfied about your life, or are you curious about your future? Despite this, why is astrology still so fashionable? Is it a harmless diversion or pastime? Is it the best way to find out what the future holds – or is there a better way? Here is a better way for you to learn about your future. Consider some illustrations.<br>  <br>  For example, will efforts of scientists to predict the future help you? Well, here is the prediction made by the McGraw Hill Institute (United States) in 1970 of what would happen by 1980: “Drugs to defeat cancer, manned spaceflights to Mars and Venus, a permanent lunar base, cars run on electricity, a generalization of home computers, the possibility of choosing your baby’s sex, and three-dimensional television and cinema.”<br>  <br>  Back in 1970 the scientists of this institute stated: “This method [of predicting] aims at achieving a reliable forecast by the unanimous opinion of a group of experts.” But these experts’ predictions have proved wrong in these fields and a number of others, such as politics and economics.<br>  <br>  Because astrologers and scientists cannot foresee with any certainty what is going to happen, it does not mean that it is impossible to get reliable information about the future? Before giving up, we should check with what the Bible says on the subject. Remember, Jehovah, the Author of the Bible, is described as “the One telling from the beginning the finale, and from long ago the things that have not been done.” (Isaiah 46:10). Also read Isaiah 55:10, 11 regarding the outcome of prophecies that come from Jehovah.<br>  <br>  Much information about Jesus was recorded in the Bible many centuries before his birth. It was prophesied that he would be born in the town of Bethlehem and in the family line of Jesse, the father of King David. (Micah 5:2; Isaiah 11:1, 10) The Scriptures also foretold that he would be put to death on a torture stake (not a cross). However, none of his bones would be broken, as was the custom with such executions. These details proved true, and they are just a few examples of what one Bible scholar estimates to be more than 120 prophecies that were fulfilled in Jesus. (Psalm 22:16, 17; 34:20.)<br>  <br>  Other prophecies include the Flood in Noah’s Day. Noah preached for decades telling people about the Flood (or Deluge) that would come. Instead, these people laughed, mocked and ridiculed him. In fact, the scriptures said that the people in Noah’s Day were “eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered into the ark; and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away.” (Matthew 24:38, 39) As a result, the Flood was only survived by righteous Noah and his family, eight persons in all, along with a limited number of each kind of animal life, in a huge ark at God direction (Read Account in Genesis 7:1-24). What about an important prophecy that affects all of us today?<br>  <br>  The scriptures describe a series of events that would mark the period immediately preceding a dramatic intervention of God’s Kingdom in earthly affairs. These events include wars, earthquakes, epidemics, famines, and increasing lawlessness. Mind you, the Bible was written thousands of years ago. These events have happened ten fold over the centuries. The names of wars are endless, from the Spanish American War to the present-day War in Iraq. Earthquakes have destroyed cities, lives and economies. Within the past few years, earthquakes and tsunamis have formed a deadly combination of natural disasters. Epidemics like AIDS, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis A, B and C, Caner, Heart disease are prevalent. Famine has increased, despite the intervention (or lack thereof) from the United Nations. There were food drives, proclamations to end poverty, but it is still a mess. Moreover, there are more acts of lawlessness. Just look at your local news daily, which is filled with stories of rape, hit-and-run murders, policemen using excessive force to kill African-Americans, innocent children and adults alike killed because of simply being at the wrong place at the wrong time. People do not even like to watch the news anymore because it is full of bad news. This was not always the case. Obviously, something is up that you should know about. Now you know that these things were prophesied. Has not the intensification of these things become prominent in world news during the 20th and 21st centuries? If there was one thing you do, please read these scriptural prophecies in Matthew chapter 24, Luke 21:7, 10, 11 and 2 Timothy 3:1-5 and see how accurate these prophecies relate to our day.<br>  <br>  Jesus explained that the fulfillment of these prophecies would herald the arrival of his Kingdom just as surely as the appearing of buds on the trees announces the arrival of spring. He even specified that they would have to be fulfilled in just one generation. All the aspects of the sign, including the details mentioned above, have been fulfilled before our eyes since 1914. We can therefore have complete confidence that the Kingdom will act very soon. (See Luke 21:29-33.)<br>  <br>  Another feature prophesied for this time was “anguish of nations, not knowing the way out.” (Luke 21:25) Now, why is there such a fascination today with astrology and other forms of the occult? The French newspaper Le Monde Dimanche answers: “Faced with the crisis, people will stop at nothing to find reassurance. Parapsychology gives great comfort for little effort, and in this age of fear-inspiring scientific accomplishments such as nuclear feats and gene splicing, people are tempted to escape to the unknown and irrational, trying to rediscover a meaning to life.” So we should not be surprised at the widespread interest in occult practices, such as astrology. It is one of the symptoms of the “anguish” that people are experiencing today in fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy.<br>  Would you like to know your future in more detail? Take time to delve into the Bible and “test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God.” (1 John 4:1). You can do this by going to our website www.watchtower.org, which regularly discusses different Bible prophecies and also what the future hold for you and I. Just browse the site and choose a subject that you want to learn more about. Each of these publications explains their importance to us in these critical times in which we live in (2 Timothy 3v1-5).<br>  <br>  Thus, as you become convinced that the end of the present troubled world is close, you, too, will be able to ‘lift your head up.’ You will also learn what you must do to enjoy the blessings of the Messianic Kingdom, which will soon intervene in world affairs for the benefit of all right-hearted people.<br>  <br>  Take Care,|`|f70e5012cab0678fa2d9990f4484b696aa	Psychics will only tell you what they think you want to hear, if you pay them you will only be out money, I spent over two thousand dollars in an experiment to see if they could answer one simple question, none of them were able to.

No?l est la célébration de la naissance du Christ, alors je me demande bien ce que les athées peuvent bien fêter. Ah oui la grande bouffe et les petits cadeaux.

05c2856b3598ce21df8a5a37e225e4a9aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I am a bisexual Gypsy.<br>  <br>  I am certain you can understand why I say "yes".  My martial arts training has come in handy a time or two, both to diffuse and control the situation and take care of the problem when controlling and diffusing is impossible.<br>  <br>  "Hate crime" (also known as "bias crime")  is not a redundant statement.  It is a specific type of offense motivated specifically by racism or bigotry.  Gay bashing, for one example, is a "hate crime".  Every ethnicity gets it as well.  Last I heard, blacks are most often targetted for hate crimes.<br>  <br>  I wish we did not need statutes for "hate crimes" when referrencing assault and battery.  The reason for the laws about hate crimes is to up the punishment for a criminal activity.  I wish that, rather than the hate crime statutes, ALL crime was equally punished.<br>  <br>  I am very glad for the hate crime laws with regards to such as the swastika graffiti, libel, and slander.  Libel and slander  when done based on race, etc, fall under "hate speech" which is a form of hate crime.  Hate speech brings a harsher penalty than straight libel and slander.<br>  <br>  Was that prosecuted, by the way?  If so, what did they do?  <br>  <br>  Hate crimes are VERY hard to prosecute and often are not prosecutable.  I never reported the hate crimes against me because I do not have any faith in the Law.<br>  <br>  ----edited:<br>  <br>  Oh boy.  And that is a textbook example of why hate crimes are so hard to prosecute.  They draw them out, and out, and out and, as in your case, alliances and biases of DA's and judges will halt prosecution.<br>  <br>  Has the neighbor at least stopped?<br>  <br>  The way I stopped the hate crimes against me was courtesy of my martial arts training.  I never even bothered with the vandalism.  I just replaced the destroyed items and moved if the vandalism got too bad.<br>  <br>  ------<br>  I am most pleased that the neighbor moved and was targetted by anti-racist groups.<br>  <br>  I fully believe that the only REAL way to deal with hate crimes (given the state of legal prosecution) is for other citizens to express their personal displeasure.<br>  <br>  I have "gotten it" for so long (I am 44) and for so many reasons that my opinion on Society cannot be further sullied... literally.  I believe that some people are good but have NO faith in society, the law, and a large part of Humanity.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for the Romani (Gyspy) we are not an ethnicity included in the Hate Crime laws.  Not that being included in the Hate Crime laws would do any real good.  Martial arts is much better. :)|`|f77b17773c514ab7c49f5696818e81b5aa	What?|`|720b96641bb8520672d52b7b57f0b9e3aa	No, they were all LOVE crimes!!<br>  <br>  If someone came up to you out of the blue and punched you in the nose, would it really matter WHY they did it?!?!?!?!

I've gotten into fights with girls who were very insecure about themselves, and probably because their boyfriends weren't giving them the attention to make them feel good. They would start fights with me, if their boyfriend had a crush on me. Black girls would start fights with me because they thought I was just Puerto Rican, and claimed I was trying to be Black. I've been attacked by my own people, White people, Religious people, About my orientation which is bi-sexual and I can just say after that, anyone can be the victim of a hate crime, and anyone can be racist.

"The Stolen Generation"<br>  The things that annoy the crap out of me over the one is.<br>  I did not steal them so why give me grief.  <br>  This is speaking about an event were a group of Europeans removed a child (children) from its mother,  based on the child's race.  I cant help but feel insecure at these people talking about this as so far I have not heard a single example where they also speak about he father and his experience. <br>  <br>  This just enforces the claim that rather than stolen these children were in disadvantaged families and often the mother sort out the authorities as she recognised that she was not able to look after so many children.   <br>  <br>  Yet all this was before I was around. <br>  <br>  So I am not going to feel ashamed for things done by before my time by people who tot he best of my knowledge were not even related to me. Not that the related things matters as I wont be help responsible for the actions of some long lost past relative.<br>  <br>  My overall point is. <br>  While people may feel compassion for the injustices in history, its silly to be ashamed.|`|CfZn9kK5aa	I do not live in Mississippi, but I do not believe that they should be, unless they them selves did some thing wrong.<br>  <br>   I was once told that as a white woman, I should be ashamed of what white people did to black people during slavery. I didn't do any thing. My family didn't do any thing. My fathers side of the family was still in Ireland, and my mothers side of the family fought for the North to free slaves. <br>  <br>   Let those who committed crimes feel ashamed, an entire population, most of which are innocent, should not be held responsible, or made to feel poorly.

If you could convince a person to do that you could convince them to go the other way so gay people could be turned straight.  <br>  <br>  If it was a bisexual person he may have allowed himself to be convinced that same sex is the way to go.  He may have then lived a same sex only period of his life yet I think they could not have totally removed his desire for opposite sex interest. All they could do would be convinced this person to set it aside for a while his bisexuality.  But my guess is he would have to have AGREED.   He could not be talked into it if he did not want it. <br>  <br>  So over all no I dont believe you can talk a person into a sexuality.|`|a6wPnHRQaa	I haven't|`|2f4352d683a1e1ff1a015a623bd5534eaa	yes.

ILc1XIPraa	Because we still have free will to do it or not. You can still chose not to pay zakat or pray. There's reward in all good , no matter if it's an obligation.|`|1ZVtTII8aa	Because although it is obligatory, you are not being forced to do these acts eg, People do not come to your house forcing  the zakaat out of your pocket, you do it because you want to please Allah :)|`|UhyvM73iaa	Allah rewards those who obey commands of Allah.

We are commanded to pay zakat, and if we do, then we are told that we do get rewarded. What about those who don't pay zakat? Its commanded to do so in the Qur'an, but since you think that just because its obligatory, theres no reason why we should be rewarded for this, but for those who don't pay, can God just ignore that too and those who ignore what He commands us to do? We are given our rules, and we choose what to follow and what we don't. Allah SWT judges us by every little thing and move we do. We aren't forced to do these things, meaning that you will of course find Muslims who don't follow the Qur'an correctly and don't care much, but for those who do this for Allah, Allah SWT will inshallah reward them. And also those who don't, Allah SWT judges that too. Salam alaikom :)|`|vKzGpEXZaa	Well, isn't NOT being in jail nice for you?<br>  You can still NOT do it, right?

He only saw the bad in certain homosexuals to justify his Heterosexual deadline...<br>  No stereotype is true. Stereotypes are just an oversimplification of a group to distort its image just to categorize it based on bias appeals. Gay men yes have a stronger libido but we do not go out of our way to conform to the sociophychological promiscuity. If that is even possible.|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	Men are promiscuous. It doesn't matter whether they are gay or straight - monogamy is difficult for any man. However, no matter how difficult it is, a mature man can be in a monogamous relationship with the one he loves. Sexual orientation has nothing to do with it.|`|qTRzRi8gaa	Promiscuous and non-promiscuous types come from all walks of life and all sexualities.  A lot of people in the bar-hopping or night-life scene are going to, on average, be more interested in casual hookups.  That goes for heteros just as much as it does for gays.  A lot of people also go to bars and stuff just to have fun with their friends, and not to go home with someone at the end of the night. A lot of gays don't go to clubs or bars because they find the scene kind of boring or it's just not their thing.  Everyone is different, straight or gay.<br>  <br>  I know lots of gays that aren't promiscuous at all.  I know some that are maybe a bit promiscuous.  I'd say they're about equal.<br>  <br>  Either way, I don't see the big deal.  A person can sleep around if they want, I dont have a problem with what they do as long as they're not dirty or irresponsible about it.  Most aren't.  Of course some are, but that has nothing to do with sexuality, and that tends to go with everything.  Most people are pretty responsible, others aren't.|`|ITMOmE5Caa	No. More correctly, it's called self-destructive behavior.

The sad truth of the matter when it comes to stereotypes is, although most of them are exaggerated, misinterpreted, or misused, most of them do at least have some basis in truth statistically speaking. <br>  <br>  That said, there are probably just as many promiscuous straight people percentage wise as gay people if not more, and There are plenty of gay males (myself included) that don't engage in reckless acts of wanton sexual abandonment and promiscuity.|`|RALliiZTaa	What?! no! we all are not promiscuous. what most of us want a partner for life and a family like any other straight guy. these men are depressed and ashamed of themselves, not their sexuality and are trying to fit in with the heterosexual community and looking for sympathy. it dose not work for me at all<br>  <br>  (oh god I'm starting to sound like my father by not caring, and I useully care :O)|`|XuhQS9wsaa	No I don't think that is true for most.

Criticizing others, not giving them a chance, believing them to be wrong in their beliefs, kind of what you're doing right now.<br>  <br>  At least back in the days of the 2nd Temple, they dedicated themselves to Torah, and mitzvot and Tzedakah. <br>  I doubt you even achieve their level.

Also check out Christ genealogy that was fulfilled too.  There is much more than what you show that proves that Jesus is the Messiah.  We don’t just take one verse to know this, but thanks for sharing.|`|c0HDLfNTaa	I'll make this simple...<br>  <br>  Jesus failed to be the Messiah because he failed to fulfill the Prophecies!<br>  <br>  End of.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously, are you really that desperate to bolster your faith that you'll use other religions holy books to "prove" you're is right??<br>  <br>  It's pathetic...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and I'll bet Paperback says "NO! I DON'T"<br>  <br>  Jews don't believe... how dense do you have to be not to understand that yet??|`|P9T2eMFhaa	So, basically, your form of "proof" is a book that may or may be fiction.<br>  <br>  How about something tangible.|`|DDYIrSKOaa	Christians do not deny He is the Messiah.|`|fLKN5nbkaa	amen!  ?|`|AA11710118	One of the most basic of messianic prophesies is that the Temple will be rebuilt.   As you so capably noted, the Temple was extant and functioning at the time Jesus walked the earth....by virtue of that alone, Jesus COULD NOT have been the messiah.  Thank you for proving the fallacy of Christian theology.<br>  <br>  If Jesus said what is claimed above, he could not have been referring to the pass in Yoma....The earliest parts of the Talmud were committed to writing 100-200 CE and that part of the Talmud you quoted (fairly accurately I might add - an uncommon event) was committed to writing in the period 200-500 years AFTER Jesus lived and is not considered LAW in any case. <br>  <br>  Next time you choose to proffer a possible proof, you should understand what it is you are quoting and how the sources relate, or do not relate.  You obvious ignorance of the construction and structure of the Talmud is obvious.  <br>  <br>  Now, go and learn.|`|GXxC8CIfaa	I'm not quite sure I follow you on that particular point, BUT....there is plenty of evidence that Jesus IS the Messiah....There is over 300 Old Testament prophesies about the coming Messiah that Jesus Christ literally fulfilled.  <br>  There is plenty of evidence for one who is genuinely willing to examine the evidence that not only did Jesus truly exist during the time described as in the N.T. but also that He is and was the Son of God (2nd Person of the divine Trinity) who came to earth and fulfilled all the O.T. prophesies concerning the Messiah...died and bodily rose from the grave on the 3rd day...|`|HqG4MDxGaa	You've brought up a good point. You're talking about the Jews who were loyal to Rome's leadership and that set up a marketplace in God's house, right? The ones whom Jesus got angry with and said "give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and give to God what is God's?" Well anyways, some Jews believed Jesus was the Messiah, some didn't and some were divided on the matter. <br>  <br>  However, Christians also believe in Christ's 2nd and 3nd? coming to the Earth someday (and oddly enough, the things talked about in Christ's 3rd coming directly parallel many of the Messianic descriptions that Jews describe of their Messiah.........ofcourse other Christians say that both Islam AND Judaism's Messiah is the Anti-Christ, talked about in the Christian bible)......<br>  <br>  But in a way, that's sad......since all 3 religions once sprang forth from the same God.......the God of Abraham. ~sigh~ Then again, that's just human nature. If one conducts an experiment of 10 or more people sitting in a circle and 1 person whispers something into another's ear and so on and so forth, by the time you get to the end of the circle,<br>  the original thing "whispered" is totally different. There were even divisions among sub-divisions of Native American tribes as well, who "split" from their main tribe, etc. I'd almost like to ask the question "why can't we all just get along?" but I guess that would be a mute question in today's world, huh?|`|xZBwnrGzaa	One, Christians already believe Jesus is the Messiah. By trying to look all smart, you have just made yourself look stupid. Two, I'm Jewish and this is no proof he was the Messiah. Look upon your Old Testament, my Torah, and look at These:<br>  Evil and tyranny will not be able to stand before his leadership (Isaiah 11:4)<br>  <br>  All Israelites will be returned to their homeland (Isaiah 11:12)<br>  <br>  All of the dead will rise again (Isaiah 26:19)<br>  <br>  There will be no more hunger or illness, and death will cease (Isaiah 25:8)<br>  <br>  Did ANY of these happen? If anything, your so called "proof" disproves that Jesus was the Messiah. If tyranny and evil and death were destroyed by the Messiah, how could people hate him and destroy his temple and persecute his followers?|`|lAMdAKmzaa	Yes.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Rebellion.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Proof? No. You have to presume the accuracy and validity of the works, and take into consideration the fact that the writer of John was likely aware of what the Talmud said and could have written accordingly. Then there is the matter of individual interpretations of the texts. What you have is evidence, but not outright proof.<br>  <br>  This is not to say you are wrong, though. It is just that it isn't, by definition, "proof."|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	you don't need to prove to me or any other Christian that Jesus is Messiah. Obviously. That would be a failing mission.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Uh, you're talking to the wrong religion. We don't need proof, we already know this.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Trying to convince Christians that Jesus is the 'Messiah' must be a tough call...<br>  <br>  <br>  See if you can get them to believe that ill health is because of 'sin' ... that's even more difficult.

Love that about the man. Mom isn't big on religion either, thank goodness. Our background is Jewish but only my brothers pretend to be good Jews on the high holidays. I really like Judaism but I dislike the insincerity of believing in it for societal purposes. I also dislike the fact that my brothers really should know more of who the Jewish people are and what they actually believe. It is a rich and wonderful heritage.

AQOQjhcpaa	well, they don't actually use swords, the sword represents the word of God (bible) so when the angels fight for you agianst demons they are actually fighting the spirits inside of the demons, and you and i and the angels fight by knowing what the word of god says and declaring bible verses out loud when you feel you are under attack. there is power in the name of Jesus and the words that he says so when Jesus's name is mentioned with authority throiugh scripture it makes the demons flee. its kind od hard to explain i'm sorry. And im not sure if angels can die or not, but I do know that after the tribulation happens the devil and all of his demons and the people who didn't ask Jesus to be their saviour and didnt follow the lord they will all be cast into the lake of fire that burns eternally. <br>  So my advice to you would be to ... get saved ...and who wouldnt want to follow someone who laid down there life for you and went to hell for three days so you wouldnt have to because he loved you so much.and He is waiting for you!!!<br>  God bless you|`|80a1c2f176d285325ff2d1173a1990a4aa	It makes just about as much sense as an immortal god dying for our sins...in other words,not much.|`|95334b1dab879d3c06f096b3b3912466aa	God is God, and we aren't<br>  <br>  God shows us revelations in a manner which we can comprehend.  Swords do not necessarily connote death.  I think we can agree with exhaustion, pain, and perhaps temporary disability.  I think it is obvious that St. Michael is an angel, not God.  Ahhhhh.  God has faithful servants to do deeds. What they go against cannot be good.  <br>  <br>  Holy Scripture says that the word of God should be used to fight evil.  Thus, among others a sword symbolizes the word of God.|`|jRmsjyN7aa	Angels were never given choice.<br>  <br>  The idea of fallen Angels is a fallacy.<br>  <br>  Devils are Jinns - a seperate creation that are made of fire and are shapeshifters.<br>  <br>  Angels are made of light and are created to only obey.<br>  .|`|AA11466759	Good question!  I guess that they can be hurt.  Nor are their weapons what we would think of as swords or shields etc.  "The tongue is a double-edged sword" according to scriptures.

f0da4a517ba6c6b58130dd41efd9fb9faa	Si ya hablas espanol los dos deben ser muy faciles. Lo unico es que con el portugues hay dos dialectos bien diferentes (Portugues de Portugal y Portugues Brasileiro). En general una persona solo aprende un dialecto (por todavia son el mismo idioma). Por ejemplo yo aprendo portugues (brasileiro). Aunque por la mayoria se puede entender el otro dialecto ayudaria saber las diferencias. <br>  Por ejemplo:<br>  1. Yo la amo en portugues (de portugal) seria "Eu amo-a" pero en portugues brasileiro seria (Eu amo ela).<br>  2. Chico en portugues de portugal es rapaz. Pero se debe saber que no significa lo mismo en brasil (significa chico gay). Ellos dirian menino/garoto por chico.<br>  A pesar que los ambos (italiano y portugues) son muy similares yo creo que el portugues puede ser un poquito mas dificil (pero no mucho). Sin embargo me encanta esta lengua.<br>  Suertes|`|8e309b7ceb773bc9b487c5824519884aaa	todos te vana decir lo mismo: el italiano<br>  porque tiene palabras que no son nada que ver y es como el ingles: hay que estudiarlo mucho<br>  en cambio el portuges es bastant parecido al espa?ol<br>  yo fui una vez y inventaba palbras<br>  me enendian re bien!!!|`|RuofKWxgaa	No creo q aprender algo nuev, incluyendo un idioma, sea algo dificil, todo depende de la necesidad  y de las ganas q tengas de hacerlo, igual si le pones bastante interes, veras q no era tan complicado como lo pensabas, ya q eres tu misma quien se pone las barreras!!|`|mxvIyWzQaa	si tienes facilidad para los idiomas,ninguno es dificil.|`|ESyzYVT3aa	El Japonés...

Salam!!!!|`|4032e698fe7b4a4bebf36785ea1f233baa	Dans le hadith suivant : ? Dieu enverra à cette Communauté, à chaque début de siècle, qui lui rénovera sa religion ?, <br>  <br>  Pour nous, musulmans, que signifie le mot ? qui ? ? Par ailleurs, est-il nécessaire de penser qu’un rénovateur individuel fera son apparition à chaque début de siècle hégirien ?<br>  <br>  Ce hadith pourvoit la Communauté d’une puissante lueur d’espoir. Il chasse loin d’elle les ténèbres du désespoir, et insuffle en elle une ame nouvelle pleine d’optimisme. Il lui dit que Dieu ne l’abandonnera pas longtemps entre les crocs de la faiblesse qui peuvent la dévorer, ni à la fumée de l’accablement qui peut l’étouffer, ni aux griffes du déchirement qui peuvent la tuer. Bien au contraire, Dieu lui enverra d’un siècle à l’autre qui la rassemblera de sa dispersion, qui lui redonnera vie après la mort, qui la réveillera de sa torpeur. Ce sont là quelques significations du concept du renouveau. Ainsi, la Communauté est rénovée grace à la religion et la religion est rénovée grace à elle.<br>  <br>  La plupart des commentateurs du Hadith sont d’avis que l’expression ? qui lui rénovera sa religion ? fait allusion à un individu unique, auquel Dieu octroie des qualités intellectuelles, morales et physiques qui lui permettent de rajeunir la religion et de lui redonner sa force et sa vitalité, et ce, au travers d’un savoir profitable, d’une ?uvre bénéfique ou d’une lutte courageuse. <br>  <br>  C’est pour cette raison que les commentateurs ont essayé, à chaque début de siècle, d’identifier ce ? rénovateur ?. Ils se sont mis parfois d’accord, et ont parfois divergé. Ils se sont mis d’accord par exemple pour dire que le rénovateur du premier siècle est le Cinquième Calife Bien-Guidé `Umar Ibn `Abd Al-`Az?z, que le rénovateur du deuxième siècle est l’Imam Muhammad Ibn Idr?s Ash-Shafi`?, que le rénovateur du cinquième siècle est Ab? Hamid Al-Ghazal?, que le rénovateur du septième siècle est Ibn Daq?q Al-`?d. Mais en-dehors de ceux-là, on a largement divergé sur les autres.<br>  <br>  Je pense que le mot ? qui ?, dans le hadith et dans la langue arabe en général, peut désigner un pluriel, tout comme il peut désigner un singulier. Ici, le mot peut parfaitement désigner un pluriel, car celui qui rénove la religion à chaque siècle n’est pas nécessairement un individu spécifique, mais plut?t un groupe d’individus, pouvant comprendre aussi bien des savants, que des dirigeants politiques, que des chefs militaires, que des éducateurs, et ainsi de suite. Ils peuvent aussi bien être d’un même pays que dispersés dans de nombreux pays, chacun travaillant individuellement dans son domaine ou collaborant entre eux dans ce qu’on pourrait assimiler à une corporation ou à une association. Les uns peuvent être des rénovateurs dans le domaine de la prédication et de la culture, d’autres dans le domaine du droit et de la jurisprudence, d’autres dans le domaine de l’éducation et de la formation, d’autres dans le domaine de la réforme sociale, d’autres dans le domaine économique et d’autres enfin dans le domaine politique. Il n’y a rien qui empêche la diversification de ces domaines ou les différences de formes que peut prendre le renouveau, du moment que cette diversité est de l’ordre de la spécialisation, et non de l’ordre de l’opposition et de la dissension. Je veux dire par-là qu’il faut qu’il y ait entre ces différents aspects du renouveau une complémentarité, une harmonie et une collaboration, de sorte qu’ils se complètent et se soutiennent tous mutuellement, et non qu’ils se condamnent les uns les autres ou qu’ils se sèment des obstacles les uns aux autres, ce qui mène inévitablement à leur affaiblissement à tous et au renforcement de leurs ennemis.<br>  <br>  Relier le renouveau de l’Islam à un individu particulier et unique pousse les gens à vivre passivement en attendant l’apparition de celui-ci. Tout ce qu’ils auraient à faire serait de l’attendre jusqu’à ce qu’il sorte de sous terre et qu’il rénove ce qu’ils ont été incapables de rénover. C’est la raison pour laquelle les masses populaires sont si attachées à l’idée du ? Mahd? attendu ?. à mon avis, le renouveau doit être relié à un groupe, à une école ou à un mouvement, au sein duquel tout Musulman jaloux de sa religion peut accomplir son r?le dans le cortège de la rénovation et participer selon ses capacités dans le parcours de celle-ci. La question ne sera dès lors plus : ? Quand appara?tra le rénovateur de la religion ? ?, mais plut?t : ? Que dois-je faire pour rénover la religion ? ?<br>  <br>  Et Dieu est le plus Savant.|`|66ebacf5d138c4f2a4555304ec19bc8caa	NON,l'islam est constant et parfait pour tout endroi et tout les tamps.|`|9MXQzYutaa	Il y a une grande perte au niveau des valeurs à notre époque donc je pense qu'il faut garder les écrits tels quels : ce sont des rails .|`|EcNEjpv5aa	Ce que vous êtes entrain de raconter est une aberration. Vous ne devez pas conna?tre la valeur de la religion pour un peuple.<br>  D'abord la religion n'a pas été réécrite elle était tout simplement modifiée dans le mauvais sens et son message était supprimé et redéfini. Raison pour laquelle les gens n'y croient plus. La seule religion qui demeure intacte est bien  l'islam. Mais cette religion subit les attaques de toute la planète car elle lutte contre la perversion des hommes qui veulent une liberté totale de leur fantasmes. Devant de telle situation, on assiste à une lutte acharnée contre le bien et le mal. D'une part, le Bien qui s'attache comme première priorité le retour à la moral dans la société et la justice sociale et d'autre part une société malade de ces nouvelles pensées et idées, effacent toute décence  et toute spiritualité en tentant de répliquer par des fausses accusations contre l'islam . Regardez par exemple, que même la notion du mariage tend à dispara?tre avec le temps et on assiste en revanche au concubinage qui devient de nos jours quelque chose de très normale.

2a93295e665a94d49d03426e34243078aa	>> who are the 2 witnesses in Rev 11?<br>  <br>  ????????The primary interpretation is still the Old and New Testaments -- which, as God's Word, are also His Witnesses regarding the Great Controversy.  Remember, this whole Human conflict is not really about us.  The conflict is about satan's accusations against God.  As with the Law established by God in the Old Testament, two witnesses were required in order to acquit or convict someone.  Thus, God has His Two Witnesses regarding His Character, His Justice, His Love, and His Law.<br>  <br>  ????????There are also, though, the 24 elders spoken of in Revelation.  These would represent two witnesses from each of the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel.  These would also be at least some of those whom were resurrected with Christ and whom He took to Heaven with Him as His Wave Sheaf before the Father on the anti-typical Day of the Wave Sheaf.<br>  <br>  ????????Ellen G. White spoke on the possible interpretations of the Two Witnesses.

Since you're in the UK, though, I'll move the Two Witnesses presentation to Sabbath afternoon at 3pm Pacific (broadcasting from 2pm to 6pm Pacific).  It is also recorded and re-brodcast at 1am Sunday.

Beside the fact that Pentecost is to be fulfilled by both the Former and the Later Rains, further proof of this is that though Ellen G. White spoke of the French Revolution as a fulfillment of Revelation 11, she also said to look for the entire chapter of Revelation 11 to be fullfilled, again, at the end of time.  Thus, for example, instead of 42 prophetic months (1260 years), look for 42 literal months (1260 literal days) for the Final Tribulation.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Not an SDA but since Enoch and Elijah are the only two mortals to have not experienced death they are my choice.

La ordenación sacerdotal, mediante la cual se transmite la función confiada por Cristo a sus Apóstoles, de ense?ar, santificar y regir a los fieles, desde el principio ha sido reservada siempre en la Iglesia Católica exclusivamente a los hombres. Esta tradición se ha mantenido también fielmente en las Iglesias Orientales.<br>  <br>  Cuando en la Comunión Anglicana surgió la cuestión de la ordenación de las mujeres, el Sumo Pontífice Pablo VI, fiel a la misión de custodiar la Tradición apostólica, y con el fin también de eliminar un nuevo obstáculo en el camino hacia la unidad de los cristianos, quiso recordar a los hermanos Anglicanos cuál era la posición de la Iglesia Católica: "Ella sostiene que no es admisible ordenar mujeres para el sacerdocio, por razones verdaderamente fundamentales. Tales razones comprenden: el ejemplo, consignado en las Sagradas Escrituras, de Cristo que escogió sus Apóstoles sólo entre varones; la práctica constante de la Iglesia, que ha imitado a Cristo, escogiendo sólo varones; y su viviente Magisterio, que coherentemente ha establecido que la exclusión de las mujeres del sacerdocio está en armonía con el plan de Dios para su Iglesia"(1).<br>  <br>  Pero dado que incluso entre teólogos y en algunos ambientes católicos se discutía esta cuestión, Pablo VI encargó a la Congregación para la Doctrina de la Fe que expusiera e ilustrara la doctrina de la Iglesia sobre este tema. Esto se hizo con la Declaración Inter insigniores, que el Sumo Pontífice aprobó y ordenó publicar(2).<br>  <br>  2. La Declaración recoge y explica las razones fundamentales de esta doctrina, expuesta por Pablo VI, concluyendo que la Iglesia "no se considera autorizada a admitir a las mujeres a la ordenación sacerdotal"(3). A tales razones fundamentales el mismo documento a?ade otras razones teológicas que ilustran la conveniencia de aquella disposición divina y muestran claramente cómo el modo de actuar de Cristo no estaba condicionado por motivos sociológicos o culturales propios de su tiempo. Como Pablo VI precisaría después, "la razón verdadera es que Cristo, al dar a la Iglesia su constitución fundamental, su antropología teológica, seguida siempre por la Tradición de la Iglesia misma, lo ha establecido así"(4).<br>  <br>  En la Carta Apostólica Mulieris dignitatem he escrito a este propósito: "Cristo, llamando como apóstoles suyos sólo a hombres, lo hizo de un modo totalmente libre y soberano. Y lo hizo con la misma libertad con que en todo su comportamiento puso en evidencia la dignidad y la vocación de la mujer, sin amoldarse al uso dominante y a la tradición avalada por la legislación de su tiempo"(5).<br>  <br>  En efecto, los Evangelios y los Hechos de los Apóstoles atestiguan que esta llamada fue hecha según el designio eterno de Dios: Cristo eligió a los que quiso (cf. Mc 3,13-14; Jn 6,70), y lo hizo en unión con el Padre "por medio del Espíritu Santo" (Act 1,2), después de pasar la noche en oración (cf. Lc 6,12). Por tanto, en la admisión al sacerdocio ministerial(6), la Iglesia ha reconocido siempre como norma perenne el modo de actuar de su Se?or en la elección de los doce hombres, que El puso como fundamento de su Iglesia (cf. Ap 21,14). En realidad, ellos no recibieron solamente una función que habría podido ser ejercida después por cualquier miembro de la Iglesia, sino que fueron asociados especial e íntimamente a la misión del mismo Verbo encarnado (cf. Mt 10,1.7-8; 28,16-20; Mc 3, 13-16; 16,14-15). Los Apóstoles hicieron lo mismo cuando eligieron a sus colaboradores(7) que les sucederían en su ministerio(8). En esta elección estaban incluidos también aquéllos que, a través del tiempo de la Iglesia, habrían continuado la misión de los Apóstoles de representar a Cristo, Se?or y Redentor(9).<br>  <br>  3. Por otra parte, el hecho de que María Santísima, Madre de Dios y Madre de la Iglesia, no recibiera la misión propia de los Apóstoles ni el sacerdocio ministerial, muestra claramente que la no admisión de las mujeres a la ordenación sacerdotal no puede significar una menor dignidad ni una discriminación hacia ellas, sino la observancia fiel de una disposición que hay que atribuir a la sabiduría del Se?or del universo.<br>  <br>  La presencia y el papel de la mujer en la vida y en la misión de la Iglesia, si bien no están ligados al sacerdocio ministerial, son, no obstante, totalmente necesarios e insustituibles. Como ha sido puesto de relieve en la misma Declaración Inter insigniores, "la Santa Madre Iglesia hace votos por que las mujeres cristianas tomen plena conciencia de la grandeza de su misión: su papel es capital hoy en día, tanto para la renovación y humanización de la sociedad, como para descubrir de nuevo, por parte de los creyentes, el verdadero rostro de la Iglesia" (10). El Nuevo Testamento y toda la historia de la Iglesia muestran ampliamente la presencia de mujeres en la Iglesia, verdaderas discípulas y testigos de Cristo en la familia y en la profesión civil, así como en la consagración total al servicio de Dios y del Evangelio. "En efecto, la Iglesia defendiendo la dignidad de la mujer y su vocación ha mostrado honor y gratitud para aquellas que -fieles al Evangelio-, han participado en todo tiempo en la misión apostólica del Pueblo de Dios. Se trata de santas mártires, de vírgenes, de madres de familia, que valientemente han dado testimonio de su fe, y que educando a los propios hijos en el espíritu del Evangelio han transmitido la fe y la tradición de la Iglesia"(11).<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, la estructura jerárquica de la Iglesia está ordenada totalmente a la santidad de los fieles. Por lo cual, recuerda la Declaración Inter insigniores : "el único carisma superior que debe ser apetecido es la caridad (cf. 1 Cor 12-13). Los más grandes en el Reino de los cielos no son los ministros, sino los santos" (12).<br>  <br>  4. Si bien la doctrina sobre la ordenación sacerdotal, reservada sólo a los hombres, sea conservada por la Tradición constante y universal de la Iglesia, y sea ense?ada firmemente por el Magisterio en los documentos más recientes, no obstante, en nuestro tiempo y en diversos lugares se la considera discutible, o incluso se atribuye un valor meramente disciplinar a la decisión de la Iglesia de no admitir a las mujeres a tal ordenación. <br>  <br>  Por tanto, con el fin de alejar toda duda sobre una cuestión de gran importancia, que ata?e a la misma constitución divina de la Iglesia, en virtud de mi ministerio de confirmar en la fe a los hermanos (cf. Lc 22,32), declaro que la Iglesia no tiene en modo alguno la facultad de conferir la ordenación sacerdotal a las mujeres, y que este dictamen debe ser considerado como definitivo por todos los fieles de la Iglesia.<br>  <br>  Mientras invoco sobre vosotros, venerables Hermanos, y sobre todo el pueblo cristiano la constante ayuda del Altísimo, imparto de corazón la Bendición Apostólica.<br>  <br>  Vaticano, 22 de mayo, solemnidad de Pentecostés, del a?o 1994, decimosexto de pontificado.<br>  <br>  Notas<br>  (1) Cf. PABLO VI, Rescripto a la Carta del Arzobispo de Cantórbery, Revdmo. Dr. F.D. Coogan, sobre el ministerio sacerdotal de las mujeres, 30 noviembre 1975: AAS 68 (1976), 599-600: "Your Grace is of course well aware of the Catholic Church′s position on this question. She holds that it is not admissible to ordain women to the priesthood, for very fundamental reasons. These reasons include: the example recorded in the Sacred Scriptures of Christ choosing his Apostles only from men; the constant practice of the Church, which has imitated Christ in choosing only men; and her living teaching authority which has consistently held that the esclusion of women from the priesthood is in accordance with the God′s plan for his Church" (p. 599)<br>  <br>  (2) Cf.

No busques romper este lazo. ?No estás ligado a una mujer? No busques mujer. (I Corintios 7:38, 8 y 27).

Todo el que dejare casas o hermanos o hermanas, o padre, o madre, o hijos, o mujer, o campos, por mi nombre, recibirá cien veces más, y poseerá la vida eterna... (Mateo 19:20-29). Lea usted todo ese capítulo 19 de San Mateo, en el que Jesús propone este misterioso, pero entra?able, dilema: Hay eunucos que nacieron así del vientre de su madre, y hay eunucos que fueron hechos por los hombres, y hay eunucos que a sí mismos se han hecho tales por amor del reino de los cielos. El que pueda entender, que entienda (Mateo 19:12)<br>  <br>  Un fraile y una monja han renunciado a esposa o esposo, hijos, y dinero.... por toda la vida!... ?No tienen cuenta propia en el banco! Y hoy día hay más de 500,000 hombres y más de un millón de monjas que lo han hecho asi por amor del reino de Dios, para entregarse a Cristo en el servicio a los hermanos... ?Y forman, sin duda alguna, la corona más preciosa de la Iglesia de Cristo!

Depende de muchas muchas cosas, si fue relacion larga, si ya iniciaste una relacion antes de terminar la actual, si fue importante en tu vida, si solo quieres sacarte el clavo con otro clavo, etc etc. Siento no darte una respuesta.|`|XaKfrZn7aa	Yo creo que depende del tiempo de relación que estuviste con tu enamorada o novia, si hubo intimidad o no? si fuiste el primer hombre en su vida? o si de verdad estuvieron muy enamorados como para hacer planes en un futuro muy largo?<br>  <br>  Si es asi deberias esperar meses  a lo mucho medio a?o (en promedio), hasta que te sientas que ya la olvidaste; recién ahi puedes comenzar una nueva relación en la que puedes formalizar meses después de esta fecha!!..por que tampoco puedes meterte con alguién que no sientas nada, porque enga?ar a esa persona y enga?arte a ti mismo, saber que esa relacion no tiene futuro ni sentido. <br>  <br>  Si te sientes despechado  o enga?ado por tu antigua relacion (ex), lo más lógico sería (estarás pensando pagarle con la misma moneda, pero no) , pero si se te va hacer mas fácil de olvidarla, puedes volver a comenzar una nueva relación a un corto plazo. <br>  Eso no da motivo de pensa que todas las mujeres son de una misma forma de ser o hacer.....<br>  Al fin y al cano tú sabras cuando quieras y sientas que deberías comenzar una nueva relación..<br>  <br>  SalU2|`|kgBa9eK2aa	bueno cuando se rompe una relacion solo estamos preparados para empezar la otra cuando hayas dejado atras ya esta pues como dice el dicho donde hubo fuego cenizas quedan ,entonces yo creo que se deben apagar completamente esas cenizas,para lograr empezar otra relacion verdadera,aun dependiendo del porque de la separacion pues hay muchos motivos para romper la relacion y de ahi se puede saber cuando empezar la otra pues todo depende de el motivo y las circunstancias pero si te recomiendo que cuando sientas amor lo expreses y lo vivas porque es uno de los sentimientos mas lindos que exite y en el corazon es imposible mandar asi que esa batalla es dura de ganar,suerteeeee|`|oFWGe1jUaa	Al parecer no existe un tiempo determinado, xq hay mucha gente que rompe una relacion de muchos a?os simplemente xq se dieron cuenta que el amor acabo y al final cada uno continua x su parte y de pronto al cabo de 1 o 2 meses ( tiempo prudente o no prudente) uno de ellos encuentra a alguien que le gusta, q se siente bien, esa persona lo inspira y le hace sentir cosas q la otra persona no. y a lo mejor resulta que esa es la persona de su vida y por simple hecho de respetar a tu ex con un tiempo prudente vas a perder a la persona de tu vida, el hecho que ya no estes con esa persona y salgas con otra no significa que le estes faltando el respeto, xq por algo terminaron. YA NO ESTAN MAS, y a mi parecer no hay tiempo prudente cuando realmente quieres volver a empezar.<br>  hay algo que yo aprendi en mi relacion anterior, es que:<br>  <br>  JAMAS HAGAS NADA POR COMPROMISO, NUNCA TE PREPRIMAS DE HACER ALGO QUE TU REALMENTE QUIERES HACER, POR SOLO QUEDAR BIEN CON OTRAS PERSONAS.<br>  Suerte|`|22bc7ca20bb8a4aae94d574397afae2faa	Normalmente, es un problema de madurez mental.

Debemos perder el miedo a estar solos, y reconocer que luego que una relación se acaba, sin importar que tanto pero requerimos tiempo para reconstruirnos y prepararnos para dar todo de nosotros en una nueva relación.<br>  <br>  Si nos apresuramos podemos da?ar lo que ha de comenzar, asi que escucha a tu interior y se maduro, así sabras cuando es hora si es que llega una nueva persona.<br>  <br>  Si te dijera que dos meses, y endos emses no llega nadie, saldrias a buscar desesperadamete a alguien??? creo que no.

Conclusion; Satanas con su astucia enga?o a Eva la mas debil,para hacer caer al mas fuerte Adan, a traves de sus sentimientos .Adan era perfecto,aun asi utilizo mal su libre albedrio y comio la fruta.Nosotros somos,, imperfectos a causa de ellos,posiblemente,no hubieramos comido la fruta al ser como Adan ′′PERFECTOS′,′y al usar nuestro libre albedrio ,de un modo que a  la vista de Dios,fuera el aprobado.

k0UJ877aaa	Te recomiendo leas La Historia del Cristianismo por Kennet Scott, editado por la Casa Bautista de Publicaciones y el Conflictos de los Siglos por Elena G. de Whaite de Publicaciones Interamericanas, Pacific Press Publishing Association, ambas obras en espa?ol. En ellas encontraras como fué evolucionando el cristianismo a traves del tiempo. Después de la muerte del Apostol Juan al final del primer siglo, empezó una deadencia del cristianismo primitivo y empezaron a cumplirse las profecias del apostol Pablo, y con la decadencia del imperio Romano, el paganismo empezó igualmente a decaer y el cristianismo a surgir pero no a la manera de Dios sino de los hombres, y a comienzo del siglo tercero  en el a?o 1321, con la presunta conversión  del emperador Constantino comenzó la formación de la Iglesia Católica que significa "universal". Cando sesa la persecusión de los cristianos, comenzó la idea entre algunos obispos que eran los que dirigian las iglesias de ponerle los nombres de los apostoles y de los martires cristianos a las deidades de los paganos por ejemplo, A Apolo uno de sus dioses le pusieron que era San Pedro y así sucesivamente, posiblemente con la idea de quitarselo después, sin embargo lo que pasó fue que la idolatría pagana entró entre las iglesias cristianas. En el siglo sexto se consolida la iglesia Católica cuando por edicto de un emperador cuya sede se había trasladado a Constatinopla, nombra al obisto de Roma como jefe de todos los obispos y se da el nacimiento del "papa" y la entrada del ocurantismo que dura aproximadamante 1260 a?os. La idolatría continuo y contnua hasta la presente fecha y seguirá hasta que el Se?or Jesús regrese a terminar con toda la maldad e los hombres y llevarse a su pueblo  en Cristo que seran resucitados y los vivos que seran transformados en un abrir errar de ojos, ( 1 de Corintios Cap:15:53-58 y 1 de Tesalonicense Cap: 4:13-18)|`|AZQ3cVyxaa	Creo que es una cuestion de fe o de creencias, el que cree no se hace cuestionamientos, cree y ya, y si eso le hace bien, entonces esta bien.<br>  Cada persona tiene el derecho de creer o no creer lo que quiera.|`|IplrVS5paa	los romanos y griegos,adoraban estatuas de los emperadores antes de convertirse en el imperio católico...eso es historia por si acaso,no me vayan a odiar por eso por fa.|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Si desde que murió Jesucristo les dio por pintarlo en la cruz y de ahí se destapo todo ese barullo, de que Jesucristo es tu salvador por eso ahora hacen imagen de todo el que se diga que es santo, pero esas son patra?as que nadie debe creer.|`|uuNWJf4daa	ELLOS DICEN QUE RECUERDAN A DIOS POR EJ NO??<br>  POR QUE RECORDAR A DIOS SI DIOS NO SE HA IDO, SI DIOS ES OMNIPRESENTE?

De ahí se explicarían los recuerdos de vidas pasadas, Pero que los psicólogos que toman más en serio sus estudios, han investigado que esta sería una forma para que la mente se proteja.

CCmhTIujaa	If I had to say which race INVENTED the best music, I'd have to say when black people did that whole ragtime into jazz into blues into soul into rock thing, that was pretty hardcore and kind of... the entire reason we have punk/rock/grunge/pop/rap/pretty much anything. <br>  <br>  In that sense, black people.<br>  <br>  But if you mean which group of people makes the best contemporary music, I wouldn't be able to decide. I think from what I've heard (and it's just my opinion and please don't kill me) that black people have a lot more to say with their music sometimes, when you omit the whole crowd of people rapping about their cars and hos. There is a lot of black music that is very politically, morally, emotionally and intelligently charged I think more than there is white music that is the same thing.<br>  <br>  Stereotypical white music does have some music that is charged like that, in my opinion, like some punk and some rock... But on the general, I would say that black music often has more of a daring message behind it or even just more emotion behind it trying to convey something and I commend that.<br>  <br>  Despite all of that, on a purely aesthetic level I'd say it's all tied.|`|AA10707605	undoubtedly not Whites<br>  <br>  Bcz i wanna say it is Cacausians<br>  <br>  He..heee.......heeeee....................|`|W0q795dSaa	WE BLACKS R AS FAR AS I KNOW., UUNUUUUUUMMM I WAS BORN BY THA RIVER...JUST LIKE THAT OLE MUDDY RIVER I'VE BEEN RUNING EVER SINCE...IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING, BUT I KNOWWWWWWWW A CHANGE HAS GOTTA COME....OOOOOOHHH YEEAHHH....|`|cfd69405c2f6ab7c0cc51f45d3c7f8d6aa	human race? we have great voices.|`|jvaF4MYraa	blacks

Increasingly, biologists have come to realize that death is also, in many cases, an important and predestined fate of individual cells of organisms. Apoptosis is a process by which cells in a multicellular organism commit suicide. While cells can die as a result of necrosis, apoptosis is a form of death that the cell itself initiates, regulates, and executes using an elaborate arsenal of cellular and molecular machinery. For this reason, the term apoptosis is often used interchangeably with the term "programmed cell death," or PCD (although technically, apoptosis is but one particular form of programmed cell death) (<a href="http://www.answers.com/library/Genetics+Encyclopedia-cid-948279)." rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/library/Genetics+...</a><br>  <br>  Besides, I don't see how this could be used to prove God?|`|63iWbpAWaa	The vast majority of humans have more complex thoughts than animals and they usually have the imagination and the means to end their own life.

Understanding this, instead of just eating and sleeping and surviving, you can actually stop and say "I don't enjoy living.

Chaque fois que leurs peaux seront cuites à point, Nous leur remplaceront par d'autres afin qu'ils go?tent le supplice..." (V56/4)<br>  <br>  Nous remarquons ici comment la fonction sensorielle est liée à la peau et la science moderne a découvert à son tour et bien plus tard que les nerfs sensitifs aboutissent à l'épiderme. Se peut-il qu'un berger illettré du 7è siècle devance la science de plus de dix siècles ?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Celui que Dieu veut mettre sur la bonne voie. Il rend sa poitrine détendue pour recevoir l'Islam et celui qu'Il veut égarer. Il rend sa poitrine étroite et oppressée comme s'il montait progressivement dans le ciel..." (V125/6)<br>  <br>  Il y a ici une allusion évidente à ce qu'on appelle aujourd'hui "le mal de l'altitude" ou "le mal des astronautes". Nous savons en effet que plus on monte, plus l'oxygène se raréfie et plus la pesanteur diminue. Ceci provoque un étouffement auquel on remédie par un masque à oxygène ou en pressurisant l'intérieur du véhicule volant. Comment ce berger illettré du 7è siècle pouvait-il pressentir un tel phénomène si ce Coran était autre chose qu'une inspiration de Dieu le Parfait Sachant.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "C'est Lui (Dieu) qui fit du soleil un éclairage et de la lune une lumière. Il détermina la croissance de la lune en vingt huit quartiers afin que vous sachiez le nombre des années ainsi que le calcul. Dieu n'a crée tout cela qu'en toute vérité et justice. C'est ainsi qu'Il développe les versets en détails pour des gens qui savent. (V5/10)<br>  <br>  Dans ce verset, il y a plus qu'une preuve du caractère surhumain du Coran. Ce n'est pas en effet un illettré du 7è siècle qui pouvait faire la différence entre le soleil, masse incandescente et source de lumière et la lune, astre mort, qui ne joue que le r?le de réflecteur. Ce n'est pas non plus ce même homme qui pouvait savoir le r?le de l'astronomie dans la naissance des sciences mathématiques. Enfin, c'est là le signe de la supériorité du Coran quand il s'adresse aux gens de science et ne se met nullement en contracdition avec la raison humaine "...Pour des gens qui savent !"<br>  <br>  (voir aussi verset 16/71)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "...La femme du Ministre dit alors :"Maintenant la vérité s'est cristallisée. C'est moi qui ai cherché à le séduire et il n'a absolument dit que la vérité" (V51/12)<br>  <br>  Le verbe "Ha?ha?a" (cristalliser) veut dire se transformer en caillou. Il est employé en arabe pour dire "appara?tre en toute clarté". Il est difficile de ne pas penser à la cristallographie qui est une méthode moderne pour déterminer les composants d'un mélange liquide. On s'en sert aussi pour obtenir un corps soluble dans un état de grande pureté (d'où l'association de ce mot à la vérité). L'emploi de ce terme est ici d'une éloquence frappante qui semble devancer de très loin le niveau intellectuel de l'époque.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Dieu qui éleva les cieux sans colonnes que vous puissiez voir, puis a manifesté la plénitude de son pouvour sur le Tr?ne et a soumis le soleil et la lune chacun courant vers un terme prénommé, il précon?oit la marche de toute choses. Il expose en détail les versets, peut être serez vous convaincus de la rencontre de votre Seigneur". (V2/13)<br>  <br>  La loi d'attraction universelle ne sera connue que dix siècles plus tard. A cette époque de l'histoire, on croyait que le ciel était soutenu par des colonnes. Comment pouvait-on imaginer une force invisible alors qu'on ne pouvait même pas concevoir un Dieu immatériel et un monde inconnu.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Ne voient-ils donc pas que Nous venons diminuer la terre à partir de ses bords". (V41/13)<br>  <br>  Ce verset fait sans doute allusion à l'érosion marine qui tend à reculer les limites des continents.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Nous lachames les vents comme facteurs de fécondation et Nous fimes alors descendre du ciel une eau dont Nous vous avons abreuvés et dont vous ne détenez pas les réserves. (V22/15)<br>  <br>  Les vents sont des facteurs de fécondation parce qu'ils transportent le pollen jusqu'aux fleurs femelles et les font féconder. Mais il s'agit dans ce verset de féconder les nuages et ce n'est que la science moderne qui nous a enfin permis de comprendre le sens. Il y a en effet des nuages à charge électrique positive et d'autres à charge négative. Dans chaque sorte de ces nuages, les gouttelettes de même signes se repoussent mutuellement et restent trop petites pour tomber sous la loi de la pensateur. C'est le vent qui mélange les gouttelettes de deux nuages de signes opposés et c'est alors que se forment les gouttes de pluie. Il dit bien tout de suite après "Nous fimes alors descendre du ciel une eau". Il y a donc relation de cause à effet.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Vous avez assurément dans les troupeaux un exemple à méditer. Nous vous abreuvons de ce qui est dans leur ventre, entre des excréments intestinaux et du sang, un lait pur que les buveurs avalent avec facilité et délice. (V66/16)<br>  <br>  Le mot arabe "farthin" désigne les excréments tant qu'ils sont dans le tube digestif. A leur sortie, ils portent le nom de "rawathin". Dans ce verset, Dieu nous montre un vrai miracle de la physiologie. Dans le corps des animaux le lait cotoie sans s'y mêler deux substances particulièrement impures : le sang et les excréments. Malgré cela, le lait est parfaitement pur et rien ne décèle au go?t ou à l'odorat ce mauvais voisinage. Certains exégètes modernes voient dans le mot "farthin" l'équivalent du "chyle" c'est à dire de la masse des aliments digérés et prêts à être absorbés par la paroi de l'intestin grêle pour passer dans le système porte. Ainsi, le lait serait fabriqué à partir du sang et du chyle comme il l'est de fait. Mais ce qui plaide en faveur de l'autre interprétation, c'est que l'on parle à la fin du verset de la pureté et du bon go?t du lait en opposition avec l'impureté du sang et des excréments (wa Allahou alam).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Ton Seigneur a inspiré aux abeilles : "Faites vous des maisons à partir des montagnes, des arbres et de ce que les hommes font comme treillages". "Puis mangez de tous les fruits et suivez en toute docilité les voies de votre Seigneur". Il sort de leur ventre une boisson aux couleurs différentes où se trouve une source de guérison pour les humains, il y a là surement un signe pour des gens qui méditent". (V68-69/16)<br>  <br>  Les propriétés curatives et désintoxicantes du miel ne sont plus à prouver. Mais notons que le verset dit exactement "Où se trouve une source de guérison" ce qui veut dire que le miel n'est pas un remède universel comme le dit la croyance populaire. Un diabétique, par exemple, serait fou de consommer du miel qui est riche en sucre réducteur directement assimilable par le sang. Cependant, le miel est moins nocif pour les diabétiques que le sucre, car il contient avec lui les diastases qui aident à une assimilation complète tandis que le sucre n'est br?lé que partiellement et libère ainsi des aldéhydes et des cétones toxiques dans le sang. Pris à doses modérées, le miel peut très bien être consommé même par les diabétiques. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "...Nous les retournions tant?t sur leur c?té droit et sur leur c?té gauche." (v18/18)<br>  <br>  Il s'agit ici des gens de la caverne qu'Allah plongea dans un long sommeil. A priori cet extrait de verset n'attire pas une attention particulière pour le commun des mortels. Cependant une personne du corps médical y verra un signe à savoir que la médecine moderne confirme qu'un patient contraint de garder le lit une longue période doit être régulièrement retourné d'un c?té à l'autre afin de prévenir la formation d'escarres (types d'hématomes) sur les parties immobilisées.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Nous d?mes "O Adam ! Celui là est un ennemi pour toi et pour ton épouse. Qu'il ne vous sorte surtout pas du Paradis car tu serais alors misérable". "Il t'y appartient de ne conna?tre ni la faim, ni le dénuement. Là tu ne souffriras ni de la soif, ni de l'ardeur du soleil". (V117 à 119/20)<br>  <br>  Remarquez dans ces versets (au niveau littéraire), comment la faim a été placée avec le dénuement et la soif avec l'ardeur du soleil. Nous savons en effet le pouvoir calorigène des aliments et comment on résiste mieux au froid quand on a le ventre plein. On sait aussi que la chaleur du soleil deshydrate le corps humain qui a alors besoin de boire pour éviter cette deshydratation. Est là un pur hasard ? Est un génie littéraire évident ? Mais puisqu'il s'agit d'un berger illettré, cela ne peut être que l'oeuvre d'une force surhumaine, en l'occurence l'oeuvre de Dieu qui sait parfaitement tout ce qu'Il fait.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Les Byzantins ont été vaincus au plus bas de la Terre, mais après leur défaite, ils seront vainqueurs dans quelques années. Le commandement appartient à Allah avant comme après cela... (v1-5/30)<br>  <br>  Il est intéressant de constater ici 2 éléments à savoir : qu'Allah indique l'endroit de la défaite des Byzantins à savoir au plus bas de la Terre, à l'endroit géographique par rapport au niveau de la mer le plus bas, et l'annonce que les Byzantins vaincraient les Perses quelques années plus tard. Qui prendrait le risque de prédire le moment d'une bataille militaire ainsi que son issue si ce n'est Allah Le Connaisseur et comment un berger illettré pouvait conna?tre l'emplacement géographique le plus bas de la Terre.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Est ce que ceux qui ont mécru n'ont point vu que les cieux et la terre étaient soudés et les avons séparés et fait de l'eau toute chose vivante ? Ne croient-ils donc point ? (V30/21)<br>  <br>  Non seulement l'eau entre dans la composition de tout être vivant dans une proportion allant de 60 à 90 % mais même la matière minérale n'entre en réaction qu'en présence de l'eau qui lui permet de s'ioniser en anions et cations. C'est pourquoi il est dit dans le verset "Toute chose vivante".<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Ou comme des ténèbres dans une mer profonde, surmontée de vagues superposées ainsi que d'un nuage, ténèbres les unes au dessus des autres. Quand il sort la main, il ne la voit presque point. Celui a qui Dieu n'a pas fait une lumière, n'a aucune lumière." (V40/24)<br>  <br>  De nos jours, il est facilement aisé de dire que plus l'homme s'enfonce dans les profondeurs marines et plus la lumière est rarissime, car sous l'effet de la profondeur, les couleurs claires disparaissent, ne laissant appara?tre que des ténèbres. Il faut d'ailleurs remarquer que plus l'homme descend dans la mer et plus celui-ci à l'impression lors de sa remontée d'arriver à la surface et il n'en est rien, cette illusion d'optique est ce que le verset désigne ici par "surmontée de vagues superposées". Comment un homme du VIIè siècle aurait pu avancer de tels propos alors qu'il était impossible à l'époque de vérifier cette théorie faute de matériels de plongée sous marine. (commentaire Acei).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "...Dieu créa d'eau tout ce qui bouge sur terre.." (verset 45/24)<br>  <br>  Ceci a déjà été expliqué ci-dessus.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "C'est Dieu qui donna libre cours aux deux mers ; celle-ci d'une douceur suave, celle là d'une amertume écoeurante et Il pla?a entre elles une séparation et une barrière interdite". (V53/25)<br>  <br>  On voit à Bassorah, en Iraq, les eaux douces du Tigre se déverser dans l'Océan Indien. Dans la marée haute, on voit une masse d'eau salée de couleur verte c?toyant une masse d'eau douce de couleur rougeatre sans qu'il y ait entre elles le moindre mélange. C'est un phénomène moléculaire "d'interface" et c'est cette force qui interdit tout phénomène d'osmose entre l'eau douce et l'eau salée.<br>  <br>  (voir aussi verset 19-20/55)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Dieu qui créa les cieux, la terre et tout ce qu'il y a entre eux en six jours..." (V59/25)<br>  <br>  Il s'agit bien entendu de jours spéciaux, ou de périodes géologiques dont chacune d'elles peut durer des millions d'années.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Tu vois les montagnes et tu crois qu'elles sont immobiles alors qu'elles se déplacent à la vitesse des nuages. Telle est l'oeuvre de Dieu qui a tout fa?onné à la perfection. Il est parfaitement au courant de ce que vous faites." (V88/27)<br>  <br>  Cela est vrai aussi bien pour la fin du monde où les montagnes se déplaceront pour aller combler les mers et les océans car la terre se transformera en une grande surface parfaitement unie que pour notre monde actuel où les montagnes à l'horizon se déplacent du fait de la rotation terrestre.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Il a crée les cieux et la terre en toute vérité et bon droit. Il enveloppe la nuit de la sphère du jour et Il enveloppe le jour de la sphère de la nuit. Il a soumis le soleil et la lune. Tous courent vers un terme nommé à l'avance. N'est ce pas Lui le Tout Puissant et le Très Grand Absoluteur." (V5/39)<br>  <br>  Cette évidente allusion à la sphéricité de la terre est l'un des miracles du Coran car au siècle de Mohamed (saw), on était très loin d'y croire et on se représentait la terre comme un grand plateau posé sur les cornes du taureau Atlas.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Puis sa volonté se consacra au ciel qui était alors fumée. Il lui dit ainsi qu'à la terre : "Venez par obéissance ou par contrainte". Il dirent "Nous voici par pure obéissance". (V11/41)<br>  <br>  Cela fait étonnement penser à la théorie de la "nébuleuse" origine de notre univers.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Nous leur montrerons nos Signes dans les horizons et en eux-mêmes jusqu'à ce qu'il leur devienne manifeste que c'est la vérité. Ne leur suffit il donc pas de savoir que Dieu est témoin de toutes choses ?(V53/41)<br>  <br>  Cette admirable prophétie du VIIè siècle est venue annoncer que dans les temps à venir la science leur découvrirait les merveilles de l'Univers et de leur propre anatomie et que cel les amènerait forcément à reconna?tre le bien fondé de cette religion et le caractère divin de ce livre. Nous voyons en effet, tous les jours, de grands hommes de science embrasser spontanément l'Islam ou du moins témoigner avec force, de l'authenticité de l'Islam et de son bien fondé. Tel est le cas du Docteur Maurice Bucaille qui a fait para?tre un livre très intéressant : "La Bible, le Coran et la Science" où il démontre avec des arguments très précis que seul le Coran reste en parfaite concordance avec les théories scientifiques modernes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Il y a dans la terre des signes pour ceux qui croient avec conviction ; ainsi qu'en vous-mêmes. N'avez vous donc pas des yeux pour voir ? C'est dans le ciel que se trouve votre subsistance et tout ce qui vous est promis, par le Seigneur et Ma?tre des cieux et de la terre. C'est là, la pure vérité tout aussi vrai que vous êtes doués de parole. (V20 à 23/51).<br>  <br>  Sans commentaires ! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Le ciel, Nous l'avons construit de main de ma?tre et Nous en élargissons constamment le domaine". (V47/51)<br>  <br>  On ne peut que s'étonner devant cette affirmation de l'extension continue des limites de l'Univers que l'astronomie contemporaine vient à peine de découvrir (théorie de l'expansion de l'univers).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Il y fit de la lune une lumière et du soleil une lampe" (V16/71)<br>  <br>  On ne peut ne pas remarquer cette nuance entre "lumière" pour la lune et "lampe" pour le soleil. La lune est un simple réflecteur et c'est le soleil qui est source de lumière. Quand on pense que l'Humanité ne découvrit ces vérités que dix siècles plus tard, on ne peut douter de l'origine supranaturelle du Coran. Ce n'est pas Mohamed (saw), un berger illettré du 7è siècle qui pouvait énoncer lui-même de telles vérités scientifiques. (retour)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Bien au contraire, Nous sommes capable de refaire parfaitement les extrémités de ses doigts." (V4/75)<br>  <br>  Pourquoi Dieu cite t-il en particulier les bouts des doigts comme preuve évidente de Sa Puissance créatrice ? Qu'ont donc les bouts des doigts qui rendent leur création tellement difficile ? Ce sont ces questions que les exégètes se sont toujours vraiment posées jusqu'à la découverte des empreintes digitales dont on ne trouve pas deux copies identiques dans toute la race humaine à tel point qu'elles servent à identifier s?rement les gens. Voilà encore un signe évident de Dieu et une preuve de plus de l'origine supra naturelle du Coran.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Que les deux mains d'Abou Lahab périssent et que lui même périssent... (sourate La Corde n°111)<br>  <br>  Ce chapitre du Coran (révélé dans les premiers temps) prédit qu'Abou Lahab, l'Oncle du Prophète (saw) mourrait mécréant et br?lerait en enfer. Que serait il si Abou Lahab avait décidé de déclarer en public son islamisation à l'écoute de ce chapitre, et cela juste pour contredire le Coran et prouver qu'il ne provient pas d'Allah mais de Mohamed (saw). Il aurait pu par pur mensonge et hypocrisie miner les fondements de l'Islam d'autant plus qu'il fut l'un de ses plus virulents ennemis. Pourtant cela n'est jamais arrivé ! Allah a beau donner à ses ennemis la possibilité de remettre en cause Sa Parole, jamais ils n'ont eu l'idée de le faire.<br>  <br>  CONCLUSION !<br>  <br>  Ces quelques versets qui ont été choisis dévoilent clairement le c?té divin du Coran. Cependant, pour percevoir ces miracles, il est évident que l'Homme doit faire preuve de méditation et d'une réflexion objective . Une multitude de versets coraniques ont interpellé l'Homme à la réflexion par l'utilisation des sens. Malheureusement, notre siècle de matérialisme a voilé cette faculté aux êtres humains et il est déplorable de nos jours de voir l'Homme courir après les biens de ce monde sans se poser les réelles questions de son origine et de son but sur terre. Nous espérons avec l'aide de Dieu que cette démonstration simplifiée ouvrira en l'esprit humain des portes rouillées trop longtemps fermées.|`|6155d68772dbbd0c22de55ac178ddc21aa	Que c'est autant du pipeau que le code numérique de la Bible (ou du COran d'ailleurs) ou que Mir va s'écraser sur Paris :D|`|6e67b2cc7b8c455d337afb9674d9777aaa	Que y en a pas un seul qui ne se fasse pas démonter en 10 sec|`|84e58e7fb6118b61a7474785daabbaa3aa	Certaines connaissances sont du simple bon sens, d'autres étaient connues des temps anciens (grecs, phéniciens), d'autres enfin pourraient peut-être éventuellement être plus troublants (je n'ai pas de référence précise de cas qui ne s'expliquerait pas par les 2 premières hypothèses). Toutefois même dans ce cas il ne s'agit que de "révélations" scientifiques. Donc inhérentes au monde matériel et donc exitant depuis que le monde est monde. Dès lors n'importe quel ange peut posséder une connaissance du monde matériel bien plus développée que n'importe quel humain. Satan n'est-il pas appelé le prince de ce monde et le Malin ?<br>  Dès lors les "miracles scientifiques" du coran  pourraient fort bien avoir été soufflés à Mahomet par le diable lui-même.<br>  Quelle idée me direz vous. Et pourtant:<br>  Jésus a averti qu'après lui viendraient dse faux prophètes.<br>  Saint Paul a prévenu que le diable pouvait se déguiser en ange de lumière et ailleurs il a prévenu que si un ange de lumière vient annoncer un autre message que celui de Jésus il ne doit pas être cru.<br>  Or qu'est ce que le coran et l'islam ? Un ange qui appara?t à un homme et lui annonce un message différent de celui de Jésus car il rejette la divinité de celui-ci et cet homme devient el prophète de cette nouvelle religion.<br>  Pour moi, la conclusion est claire.<br>  C'est le diable qui a inspiré le coran à Mahomet déjà influencé contre la divinité de Jésus par des amis juifs et nestoriens (secte chrétienne). Les connaissances scientifiques ont éventuellement été ajoutées pour faire plus authentique et abuser les faibles.|`|8bbf72c544c8149b3418a1f0b1f8f5f2aa	Le Coran lui même est un miracle, Il été révélé il y a 14 siècles et la sagesse supérieure qu'il renferme sont des preuves irréfutables qu'il s'agit de la parole de Dieu.<br>  <br>  Toute personne qui réfléchit sur sa propre existence avec sagesse et intelligence ne verra en elle-même que des signes de la création de Dieu.<br>  <br>  Elle s'apercevra que sa vie dépend de la bonne synchronisation de milliers de systèmes complexes, qu'elle n'a pas créés et qu'elle ne peut contr?ler.<br>  <br>  le Coran possède aussi un certain nombre de vérités scientifiques, que seule la technologie du 20ème siècle nous a permis de découvrir.|`|GfDMCmBpaa	Qu'ils n'ont rien ni de scientifique, ni de miraculeux...<br>  <br>  Mais au moins ?a me fait bien marrer quand tu nous en exposes un ;-))|`|KxRRBpyHaa	dakhilak.........<br>  <br>  (trad: par pitié !)<br>  <br>  @ alouette: une petite fable ?<br>  <br>  @ tous : c'est quelqu'un qui a répondu qui met tous ces pouces en bas ? ;-)|`|Xqu3682haa	on ne connait pas grand chose, puisque c'est le plus savant qui l'a écrit "dieu"<br>  Que dieu nous révèle ses secret<br>  AMEN|`|b2e2c071f0991a13d05d0dfa8b5832f2aa	beaucoup de choses, mais je sais surtout que ces ? miracle ? sont aussi présent dans la Bible, dans les travaux de certains scientifiques de la Grèce antique, dans les réalisations de l'égypte ancienne, je n'ai pas de connaissances suffisantes des textes épiques mais la médecine chinoise est en elle-même un vrai miracle...<br>  <br>  @benny, j'ai rétabli l'équilibre en mettant un pouce vers le haut|`|30osOw14aa	<a href="http://www.harunyahya.com/fr/m_video_detail.php?api_id=1192" rel="nofollow">http://www.harunyahya.com/fr/m_video_det...</a>|`|5f17c00618e4903e35796ec3a80ece20aa	c'est un grand sujet que la théologie mon fils|`|777a27fe1dcf764d05964ee80ef04d02aa	un miracle n'est par définition pas scientifique.|`|GBHF4116aa	salam mon cher frère!<br>  <br>  le Coran el karim ne contient que les vérité que la science nous prouve chaque jour!<br>  le Coran est valable à tout les temps et toute l'humanité sophan allah on le lisant on a l'impression qu'il parle de la vie d'aujourd'hui!<br>  <br>  le Coran est tout simplement un miracle que Dieu nous à offert si on pouvait seulement le comprendre en entier cet vie ne sera pas la même<br>  <br>  il y'on a tellement des miracles que la science a prouvé<br>     comme l'effet de la circoncision de l'alcool du sexe sans mariage la découverte du détecteur des mensonges les bienfaits du je?ne et plein d'autres d'ailleurs à ce propos je conseille certains de lire ton blog avant d'écrire n'importe quoi!!<br>  <br>  bonne nuit!|`|ct0M6YFUaa	a lot of.........................................|`|j6qsQzJHaa	"miracle scientifique"...

These days he′s considered neither a hero or a badguy by history books since he′s surely responsible for many dead pilots but also held responsible for saving many lives by being so skilled in his craft. And history always attempts to look back upon the things that happened in a neutral way. Honestly... he′s almost forgotten, so if you ask younger people here in germany what they think about him they′d probably give you as an answer: "Who′s that ? is he one of the Big Brother crowd ?"... that much about keeping heroism alive.|`|42177106cf20fbef6390e4d488a2a3baaa	Eigentlich kenne ich Ihn nur von den Peanuts.

k03dYskYaa	I'm politically neutral as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. I strive to remain "no part of the world" as Jesus was. -John 15:19 I don't care what the governments do or don't do. I know that a marriage recognized in God's eyes is between a man and a woman. <br>  “A man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh.” (Genesis 2:24)<br>  <br>  My view of homosexuality is the same as the Bible's view.<br>  <br>  Rom. 1:24-27: “God, in keeping with the desires of their hearts, gave them up to uncleanness, that their bodies might be dishonored among them .?.?. God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full recompense, which was due for their error.”<br>  <br>  1?Tim. 1:9-11: “Law is promulgated, not for a righteous man, but for persons lawless and unruly, ungodly and sinners, .?.?. fornicators, men who lie with males, .?.?. and whatever other thing is in opposition to the healthful teaching according to the glorious good news of the happy God.” (Compare Leviticus 20:13.)<br>  <br>  Jude 7: “Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them, after they .?.?. [had] gone out after flesh for unnatural use, are placed before us as a warning example by undergoing the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.” (The name Sodom has become the basis for the word “sodomy,” which usually designates a homosexual practice. Compare Genesis 19:4, 5, 24,?25.)<br>  <br>  1?Cor. 6:9-11: “Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men .?.?. will inherit God’s kingdom. And yet that is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean, but you have been sanctified, but you have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God.” (Regardless of such a background, if persons now abandon their former unclean practices, apply Jehovah’s righteous standards, and exercise faith in his provision for forgiveness of sins through Christ, they can enjoy a clean standing before God. After reforming, they may be welcomed in the Christian congregation.)|`|wqchA8B7aa	1. Yes, for the most part. <br>  2. No. I don't think it is the governments place to say either way.

However, I don't feel that homosexuals have the right to marry. Marriage is a union between a man and a woman. Civil Unions are fine, they should have all the rights that a married couple would have.

D:<br>  Also, Jewish, Budists, (ect) can't get married- case they don't believe in God.<br>  The bible says that those who don't believe in God are bad. So they can't get married<br>  <br>  Also, marrage is an important! It's a promice to have children!<br>  That's why we don't let women or men marry if they are incabably of having kids.<br>  For this reason, we also outlawed the elderly from getting married.<br>  <br>  <br>  and.... I mean, come on! the idea of two men/women haveing sex.... ew! Gross.<br>  The idea of fat people having sex is also gross, That's why we don't let over weight people get married.<br>  old people too..<br>  <br>  and my parents haveing sex is just obscene! They're not alloud to be married either.<br>  <br>  What if people start thinking they can marry anyone, or anything?!?!<br>  I mean, if two men or women can marry each other- then what if people start trying to marry their dogs! :o<br>  <br>  You know, dogs are legal americans- and have the ability to sign legal documents.<br>  <br>  <br>  Blacks are treated equily, women have the same rights as men.<br>  Try doing something against this, you get sued for discrimiation.<br>  <br>  Black people were once considered "gross" but, obviously that's not fair.

According to Webster's Dictionary, marriage is between a man and a woman and that clearly does not depict what "love" is or who it should be between. Most church patriarchs and priests defend that homosexuality is morally wrong but does the Bible not say that one should not discriminate? Who is it to tell us who we should love and who we should marry? I mean, if homosexuality is so "wrong" what the heck is divorce for?  <br>  <br>  By the way, I don't think Yahoo Users are good enough credible sources for your paper, we're more like opinions...unless your paper calls for opinions. Good luck!|`|WwUYKOtUaa	okay, if its a quote for your essay ill try to word it well...umm...  it is unfair that homosexuals are treated differently in terms of marriage. it is religion that mainly dictates the governments decision not to legalize homosexual marriage, but as with anything there will be apposing views and i do not think it matters if this is for religious or other reasons.    my name is hannah.  by the way people, im not saying all religious people are homophobes or anything!|`|ABMvstsaaa	I think the government have handled this in a totallllyy wrong way.

Freedom of choice, the ability to believe what you want to believe and follow your own path in life, as long as it brings no others harm. We came to this country with a variety of beliefs carrying us, open to all who came for a new life. We've completely lost this ideal, judging others beliefs now by other standards. Marriage is only between a man and woman, because it's not Christian to marry between same genders... that's wrong. Let them do what makes them happy. They won't magically change, and it's simply oppressing them and outcasting them from society.<br>  <br>  Of course they'll handle it in a Civil way. That's how you hide a good lie.

WHAT whole thing?<br>  <br>  As far as marriage/civil unions goes...so long as government is in the business to handing out benefits to people by virtue of being married, it's infringing on gay people's civil rights not to offer the same benefits to homosexuals and their partners.

Everyone has their own exact definition and perimeters of what "civil" really is, used in that context of course. No, I do not think the government is handling this "whole thing" in a "civil way".<br>  <br>  "Do you think what the government did by saying that homosexuals can't get married and such is wrong? And Why?"<br>  <br>  Yes, that is morally and ethically wrong. I'll even use most of their arguments against them. They are literally playing "god" by saying same-sex couples cannot marry, in a passive-aggressive way. Who are they to say certain people can't marry? They are certainly reaching hubris rather quickly than I expected. But you know what the funny thing is? I don't even believe in "god".<br>  <br>  "Do you feel that the government has crossed lines according to the Constitution and or The amendments?"<br>  <br>  Read the fourteenth amendment, section 1 on this page: <a href="http://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/constitution.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertlaw.com/library/crimina...</a><br>  <br>  Then look at this statement: "This means that the State and Federal governments cannot deprive an individual or class of people of the rights enjoyed by other persons who are similarly situated."<br>  <br>  Heterosexual people enjoy marriage yet in some states, same-sex couples are not allowed marriage. What do you know. Even though some states haven't "banned" gay marriage, there's a lot of gray areas with limits that are being pushed by the obvious homophobic, bigot conservatives.|`|U02wg7graa	I am ashamed and amazed that even though I am only thirty, I remember the day when homosexuality was decriminalised in Ireland (93). If they were THAT behind the times not so long ago, I am not surprised that they still are in other ways. It is my opinion that the only reason the governments do not address this question properly is because they are afraid of putting the backs up of the more conservative voters. They are afraid to take any risks because every move they make is no longer about the welfare of the country they are governing, but about the polls.|`|mUhZxm8Jaa	Hi hoku, my name is Inês, and tough i'm not american i'm kinda aware of what's going on, and i'm going to give you my personal honest view.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is nothing wrong with homossexuality, for starters, if someone is inlove, either opposite or of the same sex, they should be free to express that and get married and all other privilegies other couples have. And from my point of view, your government is just still kinda antiquated in those topics, and then, if it's allowed now in California, why shouldn't it be in the rest of the USA? And in response  to the first question, not only me, but other people from here have the ideia the politicians do it very personally and according to their opinion and not people's.|`|IJMyRWp4aa	Do you think the government is handling this whole thing a civil way? no but could be worse i suppose<br>  Do you think what the government did by saying that homosexuals can't get married and such is wrong?

It's really just stupid when you think about it.|`|7tNv9T3oaa	Marriage should be between a man and a woman. This is my SERIOUS opinion.|`|4cI8sYg1aa	Gays are not the same, some are promiscuous, adventurous, flirty, funny, financially unsound and occasionally careless in all matters including choice of friends, occupations and 'taking HIV precautions. , Some are conservative, businesslike, well educated, well read and hold responsible positions in society. Many come from good familys, good backgrounds and well-to-do families. They tend to be attracted to the stage, the arts, design and fashion work and for personal reasons often seek non-manual light occupations. This is not because they cannot do heavy work, they can, but because they try to avoid and keep well away from building sites and blue-collar vexatious fellow workers who can make their life 'hell' if it became known they were gay or homosexual. <br>  <br>  The average type of gay person is no different to anyone else, granted you get the very effeminate type, the outragous dresser, or X- dresser, but these are the minority. Gays need society's sympathy, understanding and acroos the board friendship. I think male gays are in some respects man-made , meaning at an early age in life they were led astray by other youth's, by school friends or men who, in some respects, are sexual deviants, men who betray their initial innocent friendship by introducing them to whats widely [and wrongly] considered deviant sexual practices which they might/ might not/ enjoy, sexual practices which they become highly curious or even obsessed about? Men are taught sex, meaning it matters greatly 'who taught you; as a first time engager the rules and habits of sex known to them.  Men and women are not born gay, they develop the tendency from copying others, by being roped in, and in the background you might find that sexual shyness is involved. So some men find it easier to have a male partner. <br>  <br>  Gays lead secret lives because of society rules and because of these rules they become loners and recluses and have been known to commit suicide, you  then have drugs to consider, a lack of ambition because firms don't promote gays, fear/s and intense fear of rejection. Suffice to say many gays end up as outcasts and a large number see the inside of mental homes as patients. Why?<br>  <br>  Maybe it's because they get tired and life defeats them. <br>  <br>  As regards the Government banning homosexual marriages, politicians often follow church guidlelines and with all the major faiths condemning homosexualalty you know what to expect - which is strange really because bishops, priests,vicars and churchmen are often notorious homosexuals themselves? So are Boy Scout leaders and the odd-Judge or two. Gay marriages should be allowed, marriage is between two individuals who must have the right to choose for themselves their own lifestyle. Times are a'changing, prudish attitudes change,[it was once against the law for a woman to wear a bikini, or show too much ankle, or homosexuals to meet in public etc, and homosexualty itself was outlawed]  People are becoming more educated, and good and better laws are being made each year. A gay-marriage law is good law. It puts a gay marriage on good legal ground and protects both partners. If the law says a male and  female marriage need the laws protection then surely homosexual marriage need the same protection also.<br>  <br>  * Marriage was once a very simple ceremony you just 'pledged your troth to each other in front of witnesses, todays it's a billion dollar industry, the fees from weddings pay for church's upkeep and the parsons wages. So the Church wants to protect this valuable fee earning right to conduct weddings. There's also public relatons involved, meaning is a church that outlaws gay weddings more acceptable to it;s members than a church that condones them?. The day will come when we will have Gay Churches, openly gay churchmen, and a Pope who will get married. Barack Obama is a good indication of 'good', what we have just witnessed, is Presidency  is a miracle, an wonderful event, many other miracles will happen including gay openess and gay acceptance. Welcome to 21st century man.|`|ixyNeBhWaa	Well, in accordance to my beliefs..   I dont care about marriage, its just a ritual that anyone can do by themselves or with family.  But if the law needs to be involved just for an individual to have certain benefits then I think its unfair that people have to get married at all inorder to recieve those advantages.  Also if you or your partner ever owe money to creditors n such, then their debt is your debt upon marriage.  So maybe its a good thing for all young people to Not get married until their 40's or something, when it will really matter as you age you might need those benefits then.<br>  Its not wrong for ANY persons from ANY religious, ethnic, or whatever background to get married.  To say "no" to someone for something that Life grants us, is called ignorant closed minded people.  The world is not revolved around them it revolves around itself.  If the worlds peoples are gay and want to get married then get with the rotation, in other words....  get with the times.<br>  Yes, the government did cross lines with the constitution because it says that all individuals have a right to choose.  It doesnt say that all individuals except homosexuals have the right to choose.  We allow abortions, then we can allow two people who want to share their love for one another through the ritual of marriage.<br>  Marriage is found in every culture around the world in all its ritualistic forms.  This government is suppose to be about an individuals free choice.

Salutare con un ciao significa quindi dire qualcosa come "sono un tuo servo". Questo saluto era usato senza distinzione di classe sociale.<br>  Capito? ciao ciao|`|QfxlUIA4aa	Da veneto, confermo la versione dell'origine dalla parola veneziana s-ciàvo. ;-)

6vV5yZbgaa	Lazarus died, while still owing Him ten dollars.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously, though, you raise an interesting point.  As Jesus knew Himself to be God-in-the-flesh, He would have known that all He'd have to do is to crack His knuckles and do whatever voodoo He do, and voila!  Hence, tears were a complete waste of time.<br>  <br>  Better still, would Jesus not have *known* that Lazarus' soul was in heaven?  If so, why not leave it there, knowing that they would soon be reunited?  Were it in hell, instead, then would it not say that even someone with a close personal relationship with Him might still not enter heaven?<br>  <br>  And maybe this is truly the reason that Jesus wept: He recognized the dilemma of logic He suddenly faced.  Luckily, most of His followers would fail to catch it.|`|d8fbf33ee3842aa278c1d2ac7d798d90aa	Lazarus was his best friend, for Once God felt the lose of life.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

When its time he will let u knw. I applaud u and your efforts for wanting to knw God at a young age and i pray that he blesses you and moves through u and ur spirit to help others of your age or maybe even family...I knw God is saying to him self right now "Im so proud of ma baby!!!: lol God bless and hope i helped :)

This marked an increase from 76 percent in the 1996 session. Thus, India voted against the United States in the U.N. more than Iran, Libya, and Myanmar. Despite U.S. urging, moreover, India recently embarked on a series of nuclear weapons tests that threaten U.S. strategic and security interests in the region. <br>  <br>  Pakistan, India's neighbor that is receiving some $6.7 million in U.S. foreign aid in FY 1998, voted against the United States in the U.N. 69 percent of the time. Pakistan, too, has disregarded U.S. requests and begun testing nuclear weapons in response to India's tests. <br>  <br>  Laos, from which President Bill Clinton lifted a decades-old U.S. restriction on the disbursement of foreign aid because of human rights abuses, voted against the United States 82 percent of the time, almost as often as Cuba. Since lifting the restriction on Laos, however, the Clinton Administration has sent over $17 million in U.S. foreign aid to Laos. <br>  <br>  Indonesia and Thailand, both of which are receiving bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), voted against the United States 68 percent and 63 percent of the time, respectively. These two countries together will receive more than $49 million in U.S. foreign aid in FY 1998. <br>  <br>  Haiti, to which President Clinton sent U.S. troops to restore deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1994 and which he now claims is a U.S. ally in the Caribbean, will receive over $101 million in U.S. foreign aid in FY 1998. This makes Haiti the ninth-largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid--receiving almost as much as Russia. Despite this assistance, Haiti voted against the United States 57 percent of the time. <br>  <br>  Egypt, the second-largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid (at some $2.1 billion annually), voted against the United States 66 percent of the time. <br>  <br>  Ethiopia, sub-Saharan Africa's largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid (at about $114 million last year), voted against the United States 61 percent of the time. <br>  <br>  The Philippines, which received some $47 million in foreign aid last year despite consistent progress in economic liberalization, voted against the United States 67 percent of the time. <br>  <br>  Mexico, whose economy was bailed out by the IMF under U.S. guidance and support in 1994, continues to receive some $15 million in foreign aid from the United States each year. Nevertheless, Mexico voted against the United States 62 percent of the time.

GlxCdiOFaa	I work in a cube also. My sandals are always off under my desk.<br>  I see people everywhere I go that have on heels, sandals or whatever and take one of their feet out of their shoes.<br>  Are you allowed to wear sandals or backless shoes?<br>  I would stick to backless shoes if I can. Mix it with longer skirts. This way if you have your feet out you just keep them on top of your shoes and it is not as obvious.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	The fact of the matter is, if your boss doesn't want you to sit there in bare feet, then no matter what your opinion or anyone else's is, you can't be barefoot at work.<br>  <br>  I work in a business environment myself and while it's sometimes tempting to kick back a bit during quieter moments, I firmly believe in keeping all clothing on at all times. You never know when something will come up that you have to leave your desk suddenly, or someone important walks over to you...it's better not to have to shuffle back into your footwear. Your boss is right about that...it's extremely unprofessional to sit around with no shoes on at your place of business.|`|8OREBeRdaa	When your boss called you into their office, did you show up barefoot?  If so, then I don't blame them. Do you walk around the office barefoot?<br>  <br>  Does your office have a dress code? If so, then you need to adhere to it based on footwear.<br>  <br>  Does your office get cleaned on a regular basis? Think of how disgusting it could be underneath your desk.<br>  <br>  Lastly, if you hate wearing shoes then why are you in an office job? You may want to consider getting a job @ the beach.<br>  <br>  I think you're just annoyed in the fact that your boss as a valid point, so you're making cheapshots @ her based on age. It's called professionalism and too many people don't seem to understand what it is.|`|jpH4IjWnaa	In my personal opinion, being barefoot at work is fine. Being barefoot is great, but if your boss thinks you shouldn't be barefoot, keep your shoes on, or talk it out with her. You don't want to get fired for something as small as that. :)|`|2Y0WXtyNaa	Well... As much as I wish it was, it's definitely not OK. Don't get me wrong When I'm in my office and I'm wearing slip ons I do it too. But my job is SUPER relaxed and if anyone walks in I slip them back on. <br>  <br>  :( <br>  <br>  Sorry|`|x1LmS9vTaa	Unless you're a lifeguard, no.  If your shoes are uncomfortable, keep nice looking slip-ons that you can wear when you're not walking around.|`|3cGNHV4caa	Listen to your boss. You're at work - not the beach and rules and decorum do count.|`|46492533ddbb2d578f91de5478f1e7f3aa	I see no problem with slipping your shoes off at work.  Many people do it, and it's not, without more, unprofessional.  I suppose if the fact that you are barefoot, by virtue of your desk's position, becomes something noticed by clients, customers or anyone else one generally tries to impress, then perhaps your boss's objection has something to it, if only to cater to existing societal prejudices about people who are barefoot.  Otherwise, I just don't understand it.  <br>  <br>  I have worked with women who ditch the shoes under their desk and often go up to make photocopies or some such without putting their shoes back on, and that can make going barefoot somewhat more conspicuous (though still harmless, in my opinion), but you haven't described that.  Indeed, I'm wondering how this issue even came up.|`|AA12370001	She is 100% correct.  Being barefoot is unprofessional and is left for the pool or the beach.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	Actually there are some health and safety risks as well, really|`|mJFgCvYlaa	I do that at work too, but since I'm in a cube farm people don't see my shoeless feet (I do wear socks though). Does your place have a strict dress code? If so, then maybe it would be frowned on. But I still do it when I was at a place where no jeans or T-shirt are allowed, just be discrete.<br>  <br>  I would assume it's just a small pet peeve from your boss, so no need to make a big deal out of it. Your best approach right now, like all minor reprimands, is to agree with her, and say you won't do it again. I really don't think she would write you up or make a case out of it, since it would make her look ridiculous as well.|`|s30Duwdraa	Let me guess.. you probably wear short skirts and low cut tops too...<br>  <br>  If you think she's mad because you're younger than her, then you are the one with the problem.<br>  <br>  That's a pretty arrogant thing to say.  You will feel differently when your colleagues are 20 years younger than yourself.  <br>  <br>  In any case, keep your shoes on.  Your in an office for Pete's sake.  Show a little professionalism or get a job on the beach.|`|J5zj8dWRaa	Sorry, but it is very unprofessional and disrespectful to your fellow employees (and visitors to the office, if you have any).  You're at work, not at your house.  You should follow the company dress code the entire time you're there.|`|bBHlGs5waa	No, you have to go by the dress code.

Anni fa anche io ero attratta solo ed esclusivamente da persone di sesso femminile e fare l'amore con un uomo non mi procurava alcun tipo di piacere. Poi, con gli anni, sono cambiata: ora sono attratta sia da uomini che da donne, sia dal punto di vista sessuale che sentimentale. Ho imparato che i gusti sessuali mutano, così come muta la nostra vita. Etichettare in qualche modo la sessualità credo rappresenti un porre dei limiti.

Però non vuole dire che lo sarai per sempre. Quindi stai attenta a non rinchiuderti dietro una definizione o un'etichetta. Magari l'etichetta serve per presentarsi al mondo..

AA10759265	Christian ethics are NOT black and white, though most try to make them that way. Jewish ethics are more clearly defined. Paul said "all things are lawful, but not all things are profitable". Therefore, according to Paul, we must decide on our own what is best for us. The only rules that Jesus left us were to love God, love everyone else, and tell everybody the good news about Messiah.|`|QQSwPmnRaa	there is no grey area..........

vPXrDkUTaa	From the CRC website, here is their view of Full Gospel teaching:<br>  <br>   The whole church and every member must live in close fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ so that believers' lives, individually and communally, may always show the fruit of the Holy Spirit. Christ, through his Spirit, sovereignly distributes his gifts to the body of believers when and where he wills, and he empowers the members of the church in every age with whatever gifts he judges necessary for the building up of his body. Individual congregations should provide within their communal fellowship for the free exercise of all genuine gifts of the Spirit, so long as all things are done for edification and in good order, and they should provide full opportunity for kingdom service in ministries appropriate to the gifts received by their members.<br>  <br>  The churches should be alert to the many errors and excesses involved in the exercise of claimed "charismatic" gifts, such as tongue speaking, faith healing, and exorcism. The churches should accept in love and patience those members who claim to have been baptized with the Holy Spirit as a "second blessing" distinct from and received after conversion and should deal firmly with them in a pastoral way to correct them in their belief. According to biblical teaching, a believer receives baptism in or with the Holy Spirit at the time of conversion.<br>  <br>  Those involved in neo-Pentecostalism are urged to remember that all believers have received the Holy Spirit and that all religious experience is to be judged by God's written Word, through which the church must discern the leading of the Spirit. Furthermore, gifts of the Spirit must be confirmed by the presence of fruit of the Spirit and must be used for the good of the whole body of Christ.<br>  <br>  Church members who believe the second-blessing teaching are disqualified from holding office, but not everyone who claims to have certain charismatic experiences is by that fact alone disqualified. The Spirit-filled church must judge what gifts of the Spirit may or should be employed in the exercise of the offices.|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Soccer,<br>  Here are about 496,000 sites with information on the CRC (Churches).

The Lord said upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  He did not say I will build my churches or denominations.

Primero porque ellos esperaban a un líder militar y no espiritual; un conquistador como Alejandro Magno que a punta de victorias militares extendiera el imperio Judío por el resto de Asia. Segundo: por el sacrificio; toda la pasión de Cristo no va con la tradición judaica. El hecho de que lo hubieran azotado, puesto una corona de espinas y crucificado no va con su visión del Mesías, quien debió haber sido intocable...<br>  En cambio para el Imperio Romano y la cultura occidental si es el Mesías debido a que su mensaje y palabra perduraron por más de 2.000 a?os; y es que en Occidente se lo ve como líder espiritual, por lo tanto superior a los líderes terrenales con sus victorias efímeras.|`|fj6VNTC1aa	Jesus es el Mesias que algun dia se revelara a su pueblo los Judios.<br>  <br>  Zacarías 13:6<br>   Y le preguntarán:   ?Qué heridas son estas en tus manos?

Son pruebas contra la razón, la lógica y la verdad, que nos dan la tranquilidad necesaria para decir nuevamente y con toda seguridad esta verdad: DIOS NO EXISTE.  Lo cual obviamente no es un dogma de fe: si a pesar de ello usted quiere seguir creyendo en dios, rezándole, manteniendo a los vagos que se dicen sus representantes y echándole la culpa de no ganarse la lotería, esta usted en libertad de hacerlo... le aseguramos que dios no se enterara.|`|1A1L0Efmaa	Bueno en muy particular punto de vista, "dios" es el nombre que se le asigno por llamarlo de una forma a ese ser superior a todo nosotros y que es el que nos rige, nadien sabe como es, a lo mejor esta entre nosotros, sono cursi y fantasioso pero como reconcer a dios si no sabemos como es el diablo? no crees besos bye|`|9BChnPUyaa	ja ja ja, me imagino que te deben haber aburrido con tanta babosada que te han puesto, que las flores, que el amanecer, qué montón de boludeces, y cuándo ven un terremoto, un ni?o amorfo, un par de siameses, , qué bestias|`|ERrMw2TTaa	has visto el aire?????<br>  piensas que porque no lo has visto no existe????<br>  sabes que existe el viento por sus efectos<br>  te parece que el planeta en el que vives es causa de la casualidad????????'|`|EYlmG0WYaa	bueno yo lo veo cuando observo la perfecciòn de una flor, su color, su aroma, la delicadeza de sus petalos, lo vi claramente, cuando vi el primer ecosonograma de mi hijo, ni que decir de cuando nacio, cuando ves ese pedacito de cielo, tan perfectamente formado, que repira por si solo, que se desarrollo dentro de ti, no creo que despues de eso se pueda dudar si hay un Dios....|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Si existe D's, mira a tu alrededor,el verde de los bosques, la lluvia, la inmensidad de los mares, el espacio las estrellas, el sol,acaso una persona humana puede crear eso, claro que no, solo d's el único creador del universo.<br>  Te has preguntado como tu propio cuerpo funciona tan maravillosamente, ni los mismos científicos han podido inventar una maquina que se le compare al cuerpo humano,|`|gQLbgRwaaa	Eso depende solo de tu fe|`|stWYgQZpaa	SI existe!<br>  En persona no lo he visto, como verte a tí.

Los arqueólogos Egipcios esperan que dentro de la cámara se puedan encontrar un sarcófago, o hasta otras tumbas, en futuras exploraciones. Ya hay planes organizados por el Presidente del Consejo Supremo de Antigüedades de Egipto (SCA), el Dr. Zahi Hawass, para la inserción de un robot a control remoto de construcción Japonesa que será enviado al interior de la cámara secreta. Esto podría suceder muy pronto. Si se confirma el nuevo descubrimiento coincidirá con la Clave 206:38 de El Libro del Conocimiento: Las Claves de Enoc? (publicado en  que nos dice: ”Esto tomará lugar cuando el coseno de Judá sea conectado con la Cámara del Hijo en la Gran Pirámide. La Cámara del Hijo está localizada dentro del Ojo de Horus (en la posición de la fosa ocular). El Ojo de Horus se forma por la Cámara del Rey y la gran Galería como el párpado superior y la Cámara de la Reina y el Pasaje de la Cámara de la Reina como el párpado inferior alrededor de la Cámara del HIjo.” Aunque la Academia y el Dr. J.J. Hurtak, Ph.D., no pueden confirmar los detalles de este descubrimiento hasta que se realicen otras investigaciones durante este a?o, es posible que emerja una conexión entre tres diferentes cámaras. En nuestras conferencias públicas le hemos dado seguimiento y reportado  las investigaciones de Gilles Dormion y Jean Patrice Goidin (por ejem. Universidad de Pretoria, que fueron parte del equipo más grande que trabajó en los canales de ventilación de la Gran Pirámide. Lo que resulta emocionante para los arqueólogos Egipcios es la posibilidad de encontrar otra tumba o sarcófago. La pirámide de Keops (Khufu), en la planicie de Giza, está rodeada por muchas tumbas mastaba, pero no ha habido evidencia clara de la existencia de cuerpos, al menos, en las pirámides más grandes. Hubo evidencia de que en la pirámide más peque?a de Menkura existió una momia que fue robada y se perdió en el mar.  Si se comprueba el importante y preliminar descubrimiento de nuevas cámaras y largos pasajes entraremos a un nuevo capítulo de la Egiptología, la percepción remota y la comprensión de nuestra Herencia Superior.|`|3qKCVs5Oaa	Enoc-apusotto|`|g5v2jbtraa	y.. ese quien es?|`|1HwqH5mzaa	perdona.. quien es Enoc?|`|8RVsznk8aa	con que se come eso o donde lo vendes ??|`|SU2SUpBeaa	No, todo es obra de esos musulmanes que quieren destruír el dogmatismo judeo-cristiano, saben que les conviene aferrarse a esta idea y echan todo un proyecto a andar, Enoc fue ascendido en la Merkabah hacia Dios|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	No creo por que Enoc fue llevado al cielo, el no murió,D's lo llevo a su reino celestial|`|ef8cdb15bac84bc36c4185d96fb34071aa	eso es tan falso. como los hijos de CRISTO; son unos deseos de poder demostrar así sea con falsificaciones todo lo que vaya contra la PALABRA.|`|7KJHONNxaa	Imposible si crees que la Biblia es palabra inspirada, dice claramente que Enoc caminó con Dios y no vió la muerte.

Y los hijos de Israel llevaron cautivas a las mujeres de los madianitas, a sus ni?os, y todas sus bestias y todos sus ganados; y arrebataron todos sus bienes, e incendiaron todas sus ciudades, aldeas y habitaciones. Y tomaron todo el despojo, y todo el botín, así de hombres como de bestias". (Números, 31)<br>  <br>  Pero como dice el dicho, la cosa empeora. Moisés, ese agente compasivo de dios y liberador de la humanidad, se enfurece por la destrucción y muerte que causaron los ejércitos de dios... porque no fue suficiente."Y se enojó Moisés contra los capitanes del ejército, contra los jefes de millares y de centenas que volvían de la guerra, y les dijo Moisés: ?Por qué habéis dejado con vida a todas las mujeres? He aquí, por consejo de Balaam ellas fueron causa de que los hijos de Israel prevaricasen contra Jehová en lo tocante a Baal-peor... Matad, pues, ahora a todos los varones de entre los ni?os; matad también a toda mujer que haya conocido varón carnalmente". (Números, 31)<br>  <br>  Este pasaje debería borrar las dudas de que los libros mosaicos contienen una violencia repugnante aprobada por dios. En este pasaje se comete genocidio contra todo un pueblo, pero Moisés (por medio de quien dios se comunica) se enfurece porque no mataron a todas las mujeres y ni?os (menos las vírgenes, que serán parte del botín como concubinas o esclavas sexuales).|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Sigue leyendo, sigue leyendo y luego platicamos acerca del asunto.|`|qDjQYYT1aa	no leas la biblia mas deja ese libro de fantasias diabolica, lee y practica el kamasutra

Tiene quien le sirva, si, tiene guardaespaldas, si. pero igual los tiene el Dalai Lama, quien también vive en un templo por demás impresionante, quien también viaja por todos lados y quien también recibe donaciones bastante grandes por parte de sus seguidores, lo cual no quiere decir que ninguno de los dos tenga apego por el dinero si no que estas cosas son necesarias para desempe?ar el cargo que tienen ; los dos son importantes figuras religiosas y políticas, me parece un tanto hipócrita criticar a uno y al otro no por el simple hecho de ser budista. En lo que si te doy la razón es en el apego al dinero de algunos "fieles", pero creeme que el Papa no es el ejemplo que han seguido para ser así<br>  <br>  Si tu trabajo requiere del Bmw por alguna razón y te lo dan no vería lo malo en aceptarlo, malo que no lo aceptaras y no pudieras hacer bien tu trabajo. Pero yo no veo a la glesia rodeando al Papa de lujos superficiales, no veo que el Papa viva en una mansión llena de comodidades si no en un departamento de verdad modesto dentro de la inmensidad del Vaticano y viajando en un coche blindado por razones obvias. Es cierto, no vive una vida ascética, ni se ha desprendido como algunas comunidades de monjes de todo lo material para vivir con lo estrictamente necesario, acepto que el anillo papal es una tradición de la cual se podría desprender la iglesia ya que se ve que es caro, pero fuera de eso de verdad no veo los lujos, no veo que se esté despilfarrando dinero en el Papa; lujos los que se dan algunos presidentes, o a lo mejor tu conoces algo que yo no conozco|`|e28kTdzUaa	y si, tienes toda la boca llena de razòn....seas budista o lo que seas.....(es la primera vez que le doy la razòn a un budista), pues soy cristiana(evangelica) y no estoy para nada de acuerdo con las actitudes del vaticano y de los papas, que, en "nada" se parecen a la vida que llevò Jesucristo...?si has leido de Jesus? era una ser humilde en todos los sentidos, sencillo de corazòn, de bolsillo, de formas de vestir,etc.....(se parece Jesus, mas al budismo que al papado, la verdad,eh?)<br>  Los catolicos se llenan la boca de "Jesus" aca y "jesus" allà, pero no hacen nada parecido a Jesus, al menos, las autoridades de esa religion o secta...que para el caso da igual....Dios se rìe de esas denominaciones.....<br>  chao!!!<br>  te puse una estrellita.|`|2X6ZrSspaa	Sería lindo que le enviaras una carta con todas esas inquietudes que tienen a la riqueza que crees ver en el Vaticano.

kgD3Hc3faa	Pues sinceramente ahi se ha cometido un delito.Y mi opinion es que no debemos creer y seguir a ningun hombre sino al balnco y perfecto que es Cristo.<br>  Si el hombre es irrespetuoso para muchos, Dios no tiene nada que ver.Pero los tratados chicks son verdades, sino fuera asi porque el fue amanazado de muerte  por catolicos, si lo que el dice es mentira porque no se lo dejaron en las manos a DIOS,El dijo: Mia es la venganza, Yo dare.<br>  La biblia nos habla que un dia peque?os , grandes , ricos y pobres compareceremos ante DIOS y daremos cuenta de toda palabra ociosa, y de lo que hemos hecho sea bueno o malo, pero aun ahi habra unos que le diran al Se?or que en su nombre hecharon fuera demnios y sanaron enfermos e hicieron muchos milagros y Dios les dira apartaos de mi , por que no los conozco, entonces en nombre de quien hicieron esas proezas esas persona? La palabra de Dios nos dice que el mismo satanas se viste como angel de luz.Y esas personas no se salvaran por sus obras porque no es por obras para que nadie se glorie pues por gracia somos salvos, por la fe pero no en nosotros mismos sino en Jesus, El es el camino la verda y la vida y nadie va al Padre sino es por el. Existen libros catolicos en donde dice que deben llamar a los evangelicos hermanos separados, pero cuando lleguen a las casas ni siquiera abrirles la puerta, pues deben maltratarlos porque son anatemas. Esas cosas estan ocultas y no las dicen a la luz porque no son sinceros.Pra concluir digo todos las caminos llegan a Roma, pero solo hay un camino al Padre, y ese es Jesus. No religion, ni fanatismo.|`|00ba5ed276945e9e196aa76558621f5caa	Jajajaja, estuvo buenísimo ese tratadito, como reproduce bien lo que hizo jack chick con aquel "desinformado católico", pero la verdad es muy jocoso, y ya leí también la queja  de Daniel Sapia en su sitio.  La verdad no se de que chilla este personaje, cuando en su sitio hace lo mismo y peor.  Ya he platicado con el en un foro, y siempre sale con su estúpido juego de palabras, "si, pero no, pero si".   Es muy hábil para manejar doble discurso,  es un mentiroso, sabe decir mentira tras mentira para luego desvincularse de ellas (según el).  Pobre hombre, y me da mucha risa, y a la vez pena ajena, ver como muchos lo consideran como un heroe, un cristiano intachable, cuando en realidad de cristiano no tiene nada, pero bien, yo lo único que puedo decir del tratadito, es que le dieron una cucharadita de su propio veneno.|`|aatjLb5baa	jajajaja ah que gente sin que-hacer de verdad....|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	ja,ja otro mas entrandole al negocio.|`|pCu69Jzvaa	Y crees lo comics de ese tipo que hasta los pastores evangelico serios los han tachado e falso mentiroso|`|rWB66Vwlaa	que opinion merece eso? aparte es sacado de un tratado chick, no hay mucho que agregar. Dios no esta a favor de los católicos ni de los evangélicos, esta a favor de aquella persona que reconoce a Jesucristo como su Se?or y Salvador, que murió por nuestros pecados para que tengamos vida eterna, que resucito al tercer día y que se encuentra sentado a la diestra del Padre.<br>  Jesucristo es el mediador entre Dios y los hombres (lo dice la biblia) Dios quiere un corazon limpio y que le siga todos los días, no se trata de religión|`|2636c9f88baa2c94bde5d6e6e7f1eb8eaa	Una respuesta a los intolerantísimos comics de Chick, exagerada pero encierra algo de verdad; Dios nos juzgará por las obras, eso si, nos juzgará atodos igual, no se pondrá a favor o en contra de ninguna religión. eso si, que actitud tan hipócrita la de Daniel Sapia, cuando el publica algún ataque todos está bien, cuando alguien más lo hace se arma un drama|`|9d7aed59c3aef2b17877f2ab45f63074aa	Gracias por este mensaje porque sino no me enteraba de lo que habian hecho con Daniel.  Como cristianos nosotros vamos a ser se?alados burlados sabes hay algo que nosotros como cristianos conocemos y es que nuestra lucha no es contra carne ni sangre pero las personas que estan aferradas a una religion falsa o a la incredulidad piensan que su guerra es contra el ser humano y buscaran como lastirmanos como herirnos y humillarnos porque desconocen quien es el verdadero autor de todo lo malo y ese es satanas. Y piensan que de esta manera pueden afectarnos y pisotearnos pero la verdad es que quien los pisotea a ellos es satanas.  Y Daniel Sapia tiene mucha razon cuando dice que si su trabajo no fuera fructifero simplemente lo ignorarian pero bien que pica y molesta a los que rechazan el verdadero evangelio su pagina.   Pero nada sigamos orando por todos aquellos que llevan la palabra de Dios a tiempo y afuera de tiempo debemos de usar todos los medios que tengamos a nuestro alcanze para llevar la luz y la verdad al mundo entero si Dios con nosotros quien contra nosotroso y todo lo podemos en Cristo que nos fortaleza y a Daniel mis respeto y que Dios lo bendiga mucho y lo ayude a seguir hacia adelante con ese trabajo que DIos ah puesto en sus manos de llevar la verdad y a todos los cristianos sigamos hacia adelante en Cristo no nos dejemos vencer por el enemigo sino que sigamos en pie de lucha con Cristo Jesus hasta alcanzar la meta.|`|20f44a11276a5d34fd1c07d50177abe7aa	El tratado Chick a mi manera de ver dice coasa interesantes, com el hecho de decir que cierta persona dijo algo y luego resulatq eu es mentira y no lo desmientes...ups, aunque tengas solo fe no creo sea agradable a Dios, creo que es el fin del chick, hacer ver que el asunto de "sola fide" "sola scriptura" no se puede sustentar biblicamente....hay un libro buenisimo al respecto, te lo recomiendo se llama "roma, dulce hogar" escripo por dos doctores en teología presbiterianos....<br>  En cuanto a usurpar el nombre y todo lo demas, pues si es reprochable, pero luego te emetes a su pagina y se la pasa criticando todo lo que la Iglesia Católica hace...ups...jesus hizo eso? Cuando los discipulos le dijeron a Jesus que habia otros que no eran de su grupo y andaban expulsando demonios, los discipulos quisieron pararlos pero jesús no los dejo, mas nunca se puso a atacarlos...o si? o cuestiono su bases y fundamentos de los otros? No verdad....cuando veo yo un pastor que basa su predicacion en demostrar los errores de la Catolica me da tristeza, que no es suficiente la Biblia como para tener que hacer uso de este tipo de estudios para atraer a la gente?<br>  Dios se apiade de todos nosotros....Miserere mi<br>  Dios les Bendice|`|281e42d6ffc793e95da24b97412bbad6aa	Malintencionado, no conozco al hombre al que atacan, pero creo que si se hace desde el anonimato ese ataque es cobarde.<br>  <br>  Y Dios no tiene favoritos.<br>  <br>  Soy cristiano, y se que tenemos una sola misión, "ir y predicar el evangelio", no tenemos que atacar la fe de nadie por más equivocados que estén, la misión es clara, predicar no atacar.|`|amIkDszqaa	hay un dios cada mil millones de personas  si lo hacemos democráticamente que dios ganaría?<br>  o quizas mejor se declaren al guerra y que la razon la tenga el que gane ?|`|qdNOB3Vjaa	PUES CADA QUIEN CONSIGUE AGUA PARA SU MOLINO.<br>  <br>  NO SE QUE TAN VERDADERA SEA LA CATOLICA,PERO PARA MI PERSONALMENTE,NO LOGRO CUBRIR MIS ESPECTATIVAS CONFORME A POR QUE RAZON DEBIA CREER  EN MEDIAS VERDADES .

Lo que me preocupa es que haya tantos judíos y cristianos que piensen que Dios (=Elohim)  necesita para divertirse, apostar con un servidor suyo, Satanás, si haciendo sufrir sádicamente a una buena persona, Job, éste permanecerá sumiso y agradecido.<br>  Job no sólo fue arruinado, torturado con múltiples enfermedades, es que Dios y Satanás, por puro juego, asesinaron a toda su familia.<br>  Para mí, quienes creen que esta historia es moralizante, le diré que no, es una vergüenza.<br>  No creo que exista Dios, pero si existe no puede parecerse a un tirano que juega con su primer ministro, comprobando la fidelidad de un pobre hombre.<br>  Jaime|`|23WZTQOZaa	Igual que Job, estoy dispuesto ! Jehová esta conmigo.|`|7upIUayQaa	yo te diría que nadie esta preparado para algo así porque primero hay que tener fe y perseverancia en las cosas de Dios y cuando hablamos de fe te diré que yo tengo fe en que si algo me pasa Dios estará ahí para ayudarme pero no es fácil porque hay fe pero no hay perseverancia ni paciencia por falta de amor y paz en el corazón y cuando algo pasa lo primero que hacemos es cuestionar a Dios porque el dejo que eso pasara,pero es así que la fe es probada si tenemos una fe viva como la de Job vamos a llegar aser muchas cosas y aguantar las prueba con amor y esperanza pero si la fe esta muerta nos seremos capas de aguantar pero ni un dolor de cabesa porque asta de eso vamos a pelear.|`|7x3cfpiSaa	La verdad no lo se, porque un o piensa que todo lo puede asta que de verdad llegan las probaciones......desearia ser como Job.|`|Or1MiPncaa	si tuvieramos un poquito la actitud de job,  tomariamos todas las bendiciones que DIOS tiene guardadas para nosotros, no se cual seria mi actitud porque la prueba mas grande para mi fue cuando 1 semana despues de mi bautizo, mi hijo mayor murio en un accidente automovilistico; y me enoje mucho con DIOS  aunque despues le pedi perdon, y pudo pasar mi enojo, se que s0omos debiles ante esos acontecimientos y solo la misericordia de DIOS es la que nos hace entender y nos da la fuerza para seguir adelante; el tiene promesas que nunca a dejado de cumplir .|`|2d29ea7ac28728be4e72df180cec5fb3aa	Se?ora Naha, con el debido respeto, (No Devido "El Ministro" preocupado con la valija del bolivariano, Dios me libre y guarde), no tengo la mas p..a idea de lo que les paso a esos se?ores, si lo supiera, podría darle una contestación, es probable que reaccionaria de alguna manera insólita si me hubiera pasado algo parecido.<br>  Creo que hoy voy a so?ar con lo que me pudo haber pasado si Elohim lo hubiera querido.......   Vade Retro|`|47a3739af08587ebc639f26335158075aa	Antes de Cristo, satanás tenía derecho legal de llegar hasta Dios, para recuperar la legalidad total, ha tenido que enviar a su hijo Jesús a llevarse en la crúz todas nuestras faltas, si has visto La Pasión de Cristo fijate que cuando termina satanas,( llamado ahora diablo por perder poder), en la peli grita. La biblia es un libro de leyes, Cuando lees el genesis, ves que el la serpiente no tuvo poder de meterle a Eva la manzana en la boca,( para entender la revelación) ella le creyo y la comio, (revelacion) el mal siempre va a entrar tentandote pero si tu no lo hagarras no tiene poder de hacerte da?o, Mira si hay revelacion la biblia es vida, sino es muerte. no se la entiende si no hay alguien que pueda revelar tantas ense?anzas . Bendiciones.|`|4aa299902ffd0d85f258ca157db05327aa	Jamás podría pensar que  Dios me usaría de conejillos de india en un mano a mano con un diablo, solo para probar su poder sobre mi supuesta fe o sumisión.

Job, no sabia que este ultimo era un mensajero de Dios.<br>  <br>  Frente a esa Fe inquebrantable que lo sostiene ante las tentaciones del Demonio. Dios lo premia con el doble de Todo!<br>  <br>  En lo personal, me ha tocado vivir un poquito de aquello, y Si, mi actitud seria la misma de Job...la misma de muchos otros Jobs. Un abrazo. J|`|9GOtzjLzaa	La filosofia estoica comprueba que para reaccionar como Job, no se necesita tener un Dios. El texto de la Biblia refleja la poca importancia que los escritores judíos de la época tenían por el hombre en sí. Recuerda que después de arruinarlo y quitarle su familia, Dios le devuelve a Job su antiguo esplendor y le da otra familia. Es decir, ?en verdad crees que si te arrancan a tus seres más queridos puedes volver a ser feliz porque "Dios" los sustituye para ti? ?Imaginas darle un marido, un hijo o una mujer nueva a los familiares de detenidos desaparecidos de mi América? En el libro de Job, que por cierto es una fábula y no tiene nada de histórica lo cual, relativiza su valor moral e histórico (?o dirigimos nuestros actos dependiendo de lo que se dice, por ejemplo, en tora fábula como "Las crónicas de Narnia" o, no sé, "El se?or de lo anillos"?), el autor, un escritor más como hay tantos, pone a Dios por sobre todas las cosas, y rebaja al ser humano a mero instrumento de sus caprichos. Como imagen poética es muy hermosa; los griegos llamaron a esto "Hado", destino; pero plantearse el vivir como ellos no creo que sea justo para los hombres que en verdad han sufrido fuera de la fantasía de los iluminados y menos cuando se ha descubierto hace unos 400 a?os ya que el hombre está solo en la búsqueda de su propio universo.

Por otro lado por qué exigen tal pago y detestan informar en qué se ocupa, ni siquiera entregan declaraciones por sus ingresos y pobre del que insinúe que deberían entregar.

Pues tiene que ver con las dos personas que más dentro del corazón tiene el mexicano: la madre y el padre<br>  <br>  La madre es generalmente la mujer buena, abnegada, cabecita blanca, sagrada, santa, entregada a los hijos y al hogar, así que si ofendes a alguien con un insulto como "chin... tu madre", estás cometiendo un terrible agravio a la persona que más ama ese alguien (consciente o inconscientemente), por lo que este insulto se aplica a alguien que en verdad queremos hacer enfaradar u ofender.<br>  <br>  El padre, mas que visto como un ser querido, es visto con una mezcla de miedo y respeto: es el padre serio, poco consentidor, castigador, así que le tenemos miedo de ni?os, pero también es nuestro héroe, el ser más fuerte del mundo, el ejemplo a seguir. Así que la expresión "está bien padre" puede tomarse como que estamos haciendo referencia a algo que es mucho mejor al resto de lo demás.|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	por eso mismo, por que ofender a la madre es algo que verdaderamente nos puede hacer enojar de verdad, igual pasa si nos mencionan a la abuela, cosa que no sucede si nos mencionan al padre.|`|0928cf4aed950c6089fcfb419f7a7e84aa	Amiguita: vivimos en sociedades machistas.

Desde épocas remotas, la noción de madre está asociada a la vida misma y asociada a la fertilidad.<br>  Las culturas, tanto antiguas como modernas, hablan de la "madre tierra" o la "madre naturaleza", pero también hablan del "padre tiempo" o el "padre río".<br>  Sin embargo, debido a trascendencia del inmenso amor de una madre para con sus hijos, visiblemente establecido a través del acto de amamantar, se considera superlativo, en reciprocidad, el amor de los hijos para con sus madres. Es por ello que el insulto a una madre genera mayor cólera y las más terribles intenciones, en quién recibe dicho insulto.

Pedro advirito claramente sobre el efecto...Tambi?en habrá falsos maestros entre ustedes, introduciran calladamente sectas destructivas y repudiaran hasta el due?o que la compro... Las profecías de Jesus y Pedro empezaron a cumplirse aun en el primer siglo. durante los 2 siglos siguentes la verdad biblica fue corrompidad por la filosofía griega y muchos cometieron el error de aceptar doctrinas paganas como verdades biblicas.<br>  1) Por que dices que Jesús no cito a los antiguos profetas, el era Judio y conocía las Leyes Mosaicas. Antes de esto los Porfetas como Miqueas predijeron el n acimiento del Mesías en un peque?o pueblo de la tierra de Judá (Miqueas 5:2), Donde nació Jesus ? Mateo 2:1, 3-9), La segunda la de Daniel 9:25, que permite calcular el a?o exacto que se presentaría el Mesías el a?o 29 de la era común. Jesus en Mateo 15: 7 expreso Hipocritas aptamente profetizo de ustedes Isaías cuando dijo. 15:8 Este pueblo me honra con sus labios, pero su corazón esta muy alejado de mi" compara con Isaías 29: 13 y existen varias referencias de Jesus a los profetas de siglo anterior a su venida.<br>  El libro de Macabeo es apocrifo, no esta en mi Biblia y la información que deseas encontrar esta en la Biblia y ella posee un hilo argumental que se relaciona desde el principio al fin.<br>  Si la lees te daras cuenta.|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	ya sabemos que la Torá es la única ley D's y de ahí nada es verdadero por eso se llama apócrifos.|`|fb7da14f3d33d8ef508190ca76cec1caaa	estas mal informado, definitivamente, <br>  hay muchos libros perdidos que son mencionados en la biblia.<br>  El libro de la alianza  Exodo 24:7<br>  El libro de la batalla de Javeh  Números 21:14, <br>  El libro de Jasher  Josué 10:13<br>  El libro de los hechos de Salomón  1 Reyes 11:41<br>  Las crónicas de Nathan y Gad  1 Crón. 29:29, <br>  Profecías de Ahias Silonita, y del Vidente Iddo  2 Crón. 9:29<br>  Los libros de Semeías  2 Crón. 12:15<br>  Las palabras de Jehú  2 Crón. 20:34 <br>  Los hechos de Uzías  2 Crón. 26:22<br>  La epístola anterior de Pablo a los corintios  1 Cor. 5:9<br>  Otra epístola de Pablo a los efesios  Efesios 3:3<br>  La carta de Pablo a los laodicenses  Col. 4:16<br>  Las profecías de Enoc  Judas 1:4<br>  Y las escribió en un libro, el cual guardó delante de Javeh  1 Samuel 10:25<br>  He aquí todo está escrito en las actas de los reyes .  2 Crónicas 33:18<br>  Este libro, profetizado por Jeremías  Jeremías 25:13<br>  A hablarte, desde los días de Josías hasta hoy  Jeremías 36:2<br>  Escribió, pues, Jeremías en un libro todo el mal..

Juan 21:25<br>  <br>  si todo esto se perdio ?porque no fue conservado por dios?<br>  todos estos libros fueron citados por profetas y escritores de la biblia.<br>  <br>  Después de la destrucción de Jerusalén en el a?o 70 dC, el grupo judío predominante fue el de los fariseos, que sí considera al canon como conformado por la Ley, los Profetas y las Escrituras. Así, a finales del siglo I dC el Judaísmo estableció en Yamnia (Yavne) como canon de sus libros sagrados aquellos que cumplieran tres requisitos: que hubiera una copia del libro en cuestión que se supiera que fue escrito antes del a?o 300 adC (cuando la helenización llegó a Palestina, con los problemas culturales y religiosos subsecuentes, y que pueden leerse en libros como los de los Macabeos o el de Daniel), que dicha copia estuviera escrita en hebreo o cuando menos arameo (no griego, la lengua y cultura invasora) y que tuviera un mensaje considerado como inspirado o dirigido al pueblo de Dios (con lo que también algunos libros que cumplían las dos características anteriores tuvieron que salir del canon).<br>  bajo este canon entonces no debieron entrar en la biblia ningun escrito del nuevo testamento, pues los evangelios y las cartas fueron escritas en griego.<br>  <br>    El canon de la Septuagésima (Alejandrino) es el que usaba Jesucristo y los Apóstoles<br>  <br>  El canon de Alejandrino, con los siete libros deuterocanónicos, era el mas usado por los judíos en la era Apostólica. Este canon es el utilizado por Cristo y los escritores del Nuevo Testamento. 300 de las 350 referencias al Antiguo Testamento que se hacen en el Nuevo Testamento son tomadas de la versión alejandrina. Por eso no hay duda de que la Iglesia apostólica del primer siglo aceptó los libros deuterocanónicos como parte de su canon (libros reconocidos como Palabra de Dios). Por ejemplo, Orígenes, Padre de la Iglesia (+254), afirmó que los cristianos usaban estos libros aunque algunos líderes judíos no los aceptaban oficialmente. <br>  <br>  Los judíos establecen un nuevo canon después Cristo<br>  <br>  Al final del primer siglo de la era cristiana, una escuela judía hizo un nuevo canon hebreo en la ciudad de Jamnia, en Palestina. Ellos querían cerrar el período de revelación siglos antes de la venida de Jesús, buscando así distanciarse del cristianismo. Por eso cerraron el canon con los profetas Esdras (458 a.C.), Nehemías (445 a.C.), y Malaquías (433 a.C.). Por lo tanto dejaron fuera del canon los últimos siete libros reconocidos por el canon de Alejandrino. <br>  <br>    Los concilios de la Iglesia Católica - el   Concilio de Hipona, en el a?o 393 A.D. y el Concilio de Cartago, en el a?o 397 y 419 A.D., ambos en el norte de áfrica -   confirmaron  el canon Alejandrino (con 46 libros para el Antiguo Testamento) y también fijaron el canon del Nuevo Testamento con 27 libros.<br>  <br>   Es interesante notar que la Biblia Gutenberg, la primera Biblia impresa, es la Biblia latina (Vulgata), por lo tanto, contenía los 46 libros del canon alejandrino.<br>  <br>  El reformador espa?ol, Casiodoro de Reina, respetó el canon católico de la Biblia en su traducción, la cual es considerada una joya de literatura. Pero luego Cipriano de Valera quitó los deuterocanónicos en su versión conocida como Reina-Valera.|`|HYByHIe0aa	Los suprimieron que es diferente<br>  pruebas:<br>  1.- de donde sacaste la Biblia si antes tu secta no existía??<br>  2.-Va en contra de ideologias y teologias suyas, los reformadores protestantes decidieron rechazar.<br>  3.- Los deuterocanónicos ense?an doctrina católica, y por esta razón fueron sacados del Antiguo Testamento <br>  4.- Sólo conocían los judíos europeo; no estaban al tanto de los judíos africanos, como los judíos etíopes que aceptan los deuterocanónicos como parte de su Biblia.<br>  5.- Mientras los protestantes están dispuestos a aceptar el testimonio de Hipona y Cartago (los concilios que más comúnmente citan  acerca de la ca- nonicidad de los deuterocanónicos del Nuevo Testamento), no están dispuestos a aceptar el testimonio de Hipona y Cartago acerca de la canonicidad de los deuterocanónicos del Antiguo Testamento.Que irónico<br>  <br>  LOS SACARON por no convenir a sus doctrinas y a sus ense?anzas.|`|30c2a9d7ea3f88fc9360eebbbfaa9fd9aa	A que le llamas causar polemica? a que te conteste pastorsucho.. por favor!

Sufrimos porque nos hemos inventado dioses que vengan a explicar de una forma sencilla el motivo de nuestra existencia y nuestro destino. Sufrimos porque el hombre moderno va abandonando a los antiguos dioses en la medida que nuestro conocimiento crece, sufrimos porque ya no nos alcanzan las antiguas respuestas para explicar quienes somos, sufrimos la angustia de tener más preguntas sin respuesta en la medida de que el conocimiento científico devela algunas incógnitas generando otras. Pero lo que nos causa más sufrimiento, es ir disgregándonos como sociedad al extremo de caer en el individualismo, lo que nos enferma de soledad y de hastío.

"porque la gente sufre?" decia el peluquero: si dios existiera la gente no sufriria", y asi se paso declarando en contra de dios toda la sesion del corte. <br>  al salir el sr. de la peluqueria, encontro a un mendigo muy sucio con hambre con barbas largas y desarregladas y el pelo muy largo. urgentemente necesitaba un corte. el sr. regreso a la peluqueria y le dijo al peluquero: "sabe? no existen los peluqueros. como? le dijo el otro: claro que existen yo soy peluquero le contesto; porque dice que no existen los peluqueros si usted esta viendo uno.<br>  le dice el sr: porque alla afuera hay un mendigo que tiene el cabello y las barbas largas y desarregladas.<br>  "lo que pasa es que el no viene a mi y por eso no le puedo cortar el cabello, pero eso no significa que no hayan peluqueros, si el quiere verse bien y quitarse las barbas vendria a mi no cree?<br>  exactamente es lo mismo con dios sr. peluquero" le contesta el otro. como usted no quiere nada con dios, por eso dice que no existe dios, pero el si esxiste, loq ue pasa qes que nadie quiere ir con el para que nos cortes el cabello y las barbas largas del pecado no cree sr. peluquero?<br>  por otro lado el sufrimiento que tu mencionas no es el camino para llegar a dios y la fe no se fortalece solo con el sufrimiento. jesus mismo dice en la biblia: yo soy el camino, la verdad y la vida, NADIE viene al padre si no es por MI. ya ves que ves que no es por el sufriimiento? saludos<br>  vivir es increible, con jesus es fascinante.|`|iEBidvX0aa	ya la constestaste, si existiera la gente sufriria?|`|EpfxNhUcaa	Cuando Dios llama a Job, su condición era bastante buena. Observa: “Su hacienda era de siete mil ovejas, tres mil camellos, quinientas yuntas de bueyes, quinientas asnas y muchísimos criados. Era el hombre más importante de todos los orientales.” (Job 1:3). Job, cuyo nombre significa integridad bajo fuego, él tenía 10 hijos, y en aquella época los hijos representaban la posición de las personas, tenencias extensas de la tierra, criados y abundancia increíble. ?Cómo alguien podría perder todo esto sin estar resentido por ello? Pero a pesar de ello Job se mantuvo fiel a Dios: “En todo esto no pecó Job ni atribuyó a Dios despropósito alguno.” (Job 1:22). Y en lugar de ello el dijo; “él le dijo: Como suele hablar cualquier mujer insensata, así has hablado. ?Pues qué? ?Recibiremos de Dios el bien, y el mal no lo recibiremos? En todo esto no pecó Job con sus labios.” (Job 2:10). ?Cuál fue su secreto? <br>  Hay 3 posibilidades: <br>   <br>  (1) él  reconoció el derecho  de Dios de controlar los acontecimientos en su vida:   cuando las cosas se ponían difíciles él dijo: “Aunque él me mate, en él esperaré. Ciertamente defenderé delante de él mis caminos” (Job 13:15). él entendió que todo aquello que Dios permitía era para bendición. Así que él dijo: “Yo reconozco que todo lo puedes y que no hay pensamiento que te sea oculto.” (Job 42:2) .   <br>  (2) él buscó  sabiduría en la adversidad: Observa: “Y que después de deshecha esta mi piel, en mi carne he de ver a Dios. Lo veré por mí mismo; mis ojos lo verán, no los de otro. Pero ahora mi corazón se consume dentro de mí.” (Job 19:26-27). La mirada de Job, estaba puesta en un futuro sin dolor ni sufrimiento, el no estaba mirando su desgracia momentánea, el tenía la certeza de un ma?ana de bendición.  <br>  (3) Reconoció sus limitaciones   En vez de estar buscando una respuesta y un porqué a las cosas que le sucedían, Job le dijo a Dios: “?Quién es el que, falto de entendimiento, oscurece el consejo? Así hablaba yo, y nada entendía; eran cosas demasiado maravillosas para mí, que yo no comprendía. Escucha, te ruego, y hablaré. Te preguntaré y tú me ense?arás. De oídas te conocía, mas ahora mis ojos te ven.” (Job 42:3-5). él podía ver a Dios en todo aquello que le sucedía ?Puedes tu hacer lo mismo?|`|koZJVgCJaa	tu lo has dicho.........<br>  <br>  por lo que veo las religiones causan muchos trastornos emocionales y existenciales......|`|EKmheW8raa	te felicito y ojalá esa inocencia infantil te siga durando, incluso cuando tengas mas de 7 a?os...<br>  un beso en Cilencio y no leas mi blog, es cínico.<br>  cilencionosecalla.blogspot.com|`|d3a556c010edf2b537a48c55860e68bcaa	no estas preguntando... tu respuesta es magnifica.|`|g6TDn3oKaa	Sabes?? , buena pregunta , y dejame decirte solo algo , y muy cierto , el hombre sufre. simplemente porque no se a encontrado a si mismo, porque no se ama  a si mismo, y cuando esa parte tan simple suceda, nunca mas habra dolor y tristeza , en la humanidad. es simple, si te amas a ti mismo , podras dar amor a tus semejantes ,porque lo que no quieres para ti, no lo querras para los demas. asi de sencillo, saludos.

El adulterio del que fueron culpables era un pecado grave que la ley de Dios castigaba con la muerte. (2 Samuel 11:1-5; Deuteronomio 5:18; 22:22.) Si Dios hubiera permitido que los hombres que estaban bajo la Ley emitieran el juicio, el hijo que se estaba formando en la matriz de Bat-seba habría muerto con ella. Pero Jehová escogió tratar este caso de modo diferente, y puesto que es “el Juez de toda la tierra”, ciertamente podía hacerlo con todo derecho. (Génesis 18:25.)<br>  <br>  Cuando se le hizo ver su culpa, David reconoció: “He pecado contra Jehová”. Entonces el vocero de Dios le dijo a David: “Jehová, a su vez, efectivamente deja pasar tu pecado. No morirás”. (2 Samuel 12:13.) A David se le mostró misericordia debido al pacto del Reino. Además, como Dios puede leer el corazón, pudo haber visto la autenticidad del arrepentimiento de David y concluido que había razón para extenderles misericordia. Aún así, David y Bat-seba no iban a escapar de todas las consecuencias de su error. Se les dijo: “A pesar de esto, por cuanto innegablemente has tratado a Jehová con falta de respeto mediante esta cosa, también el hijo mismo, que acaba de nacerte, positivamente morirá”. (2 Samuel 12:14.)<br>  <br>  Dios ‘le asestó un golpe’ al hijo que no les pertenecía; el ni?o enfermó y murió. Alguien hoy, centrándose en la muerte del ni?o, podría pensar que este juicio fue demasiado duro. Sin embargo, debe tenerse presente que si este caso de adulterio se hubiera tratado ante jueces humanos bajo la Ley, los tres (David, Bat-seba y el ni?o que llevaba en su matriz) habrían perdido la vida. Desde este punto de vista, el que Dios permitiera a dos de ellos seguir viviendo fue una muestra de misericordia. Además, no tenemos todos los hechos, como información en cuanto a la salud que pudo haber tenido el ni?o al nacer. De todos modos, podemos aceptar la manera como Dios trató este caso, confiando en que lo que hizo fue imparcial, sabio y justo. Incluso el mismo David reconoció más tarde: “En cuanto al Dios verdadero, perfecto es su camino”. (2 Samuel 22:31; compárese con Job 34:12; Isaías 55:11.)<br>  <br>  Lo que acaba de mencionarse encaja con el modo como David reaccionó al oír el juicio de Dios. Mientras el ni?o estuvo enfermo, David lloró y ayunó. Pero una vez hubo muerto, David se dio cuenta de que el caso había terminado. (2 Samuel 12:22, 23.) Confiando en el juicio de Dios, David procedió a consolar a Bat-seba (ahora su esposa legal), garantizándole que su matrimonio continuaría. Después les nació Salomón, quien llegó a ser el sucesor de David.<br>  <br>  El modo como Dios trató ese caso no debe verse como una contradicción de Deuteronomio 24:16 o Ezequiel 18:20.<br>  <br>  Una parte de la Ley decía: “Padres no deben ser muertos a causa de hijos, e hijos no deben ser muertos a causa de padres. Cada cual debe ser muerto por su propio pecado”. (Deuteronomio 24:16.) Estas instrucciones eran para los jueces israelitas que trataban casos legales. Los jueces no podían leer el corazón. Tenían que tratar cada caso sobre la base de la conducta del implicado, establecida por los hechos.<br>  <br>  De modo similar, Ezequiel 18:20 dice: “Un hijo mismo no llevará nada debido al error del padre, y un padre mismo no llevará nada debido al error del hijo. Sobre sí mismo la misma justicia del justo llegará a estar y sobre sí mismo la misma iniquidad del inicuo llegará a estar”. Esas palabras se referían primariamente a los adultos. El contexto habla de un hijo que veía la iniquidad de su padre pero que no participaba en ella; en vez de eso, llevaba a cabo las decisiones judiciales de Jehová y andaba en Sus estatutos. Un hijo así sería conservado con vida cuando su padre muriera. (Ezequiel 18:14-17.)<br>  <br>  Aun así, es innegable que los hijos pueden sufrir las consecuencias del proceder de sus padres. Los padres que son derrochadores o insensatos pueden acarrear pobreza a toda la familia. O imagínese cómo afectaría a los hijos el que un padre delincuente fuera sentenciado a prisión. Incluso las calamidades que Dios trajo justamente sobre Israel por su iniquidad afectaron a los hijos en aquel tiempo. (Deuteronomio 28:15, 20-32; Ezequiel 8:6-18; 9:5-10.) Por esa razón, Dios instó a su pueblo de la siguiente manera: “Y tienes que escoger la vida a fin de que te mantengas vivo, tú y tu prole, amando a Jehová tu Dios, escuchando su voz y adhiriéndote a él; porque él es tu vida y la longitud de tus días”. (Deuteronomio 30:19, 20.)<br>  <br>  La experiencia de David y Bat-seba debería hacer reflexionar a los padres sobre cómo su propia conducta puede afectar de manera importante a sus hijos. Si los padres ‘están en temor del nombre de Dios, el sol de la justicia puede brillar’ para bendición de toda la familia. (Malaquías 4:2.)|`|386ec103e9c9b898771d0367372d8fa1aa	yo te explico lo rusitos le entiendieron mal a tatita Dios, o tatita lo penso mejor no se no estoy seguro porque tampoco quiero ofender a la don Cohen buen amigo mio, pero pa que vo comprenda tene que lee el nuevo testamento que por eso se llama nuevo y no viejo como el otro, te da cuenta vo, algo nuevo e algo actual que sirve que anda y viejo quiere deci que ya no se usa, entende eso ya no sirve, en cambio el nuevo ahi esta la posta, porque ahi esta la gistoria del paisano jesu, que era judio como don Cohen y que adema era hijo del mismisimo TATA, te lo ponga asi grande pa que vo comprenda, lo diferencie del otro, del tatita que e jesu y ahi dice yo no lo lei pero se lo escucha deci al cura Roque que dijo que hay que amar al projimo, osea que vos y yo no tenemos que amar, tuito lo dema no importa, un saludo del guacho Truelo siempre a su disposicion y pa lo que guste mandar.|`|Moz62U1haa	LA BIBLIA ES UNA METáFORA, Y COMO TAL DEBE SER LEíDA.

Un análisis de la historia inglesa nos lleva a esa conclusión: la reina isabel -protestante- hizo matar a su pariente escocesa -católica- por el peligro que representaba para su corona; el rey enrique viii hizo matar todas sus mujeres, excepto la última a quien no le alcanzó la vida para hacerlo, por cuestiones de conveniencia política; durante la segunda guerra mundial, los ingleses recurrieron a todas las prácticas traicioneras que uno pueda imaginar para derrotar la alemania nazi, nadie les reclamó porque los nazis se mostraron bestias, pero quedó demostrado que con los ingleses no se juega; durante la colonización de América, los ingleses inventaron los piratas para apoderarse de las fortunas que venían de América; también promovieron la independencia de las colonias espa?olas para poder comerciar en mejores condiciones con ellos, antes intentaron invadirlas y casi lo logran; se apoderaron de las Islas Malvinas y no tienen ningún interés en devolverlas; en cada país tendrán una historia para contar de lo traidores, taimados, soberbios, delicados y simpáticos que son los ingleses y cómo les fascina salirse con la suya cualquiera sea el argumento del contrincante, aún matándolo, también es un clásico que les gusta decir que siempre hacen lo correcto, claro, lo correcto para ellos, no para las dos partes;  hay excepciones, por ejemplo con Ghandi no pudieron pero quizás les haya convenido entregar la India y con los chinos no quisieron discutir más tiempo por Hong Kong; ?Uds. creen que una ilusa princesita iba a ser un obstáculo en su política de conservar la pureza inglesa y su férrea alianza con los estados unidos hasta las últimas consecuencias? Es más, hasta los dos principitos corren peligro de muerte, hasta ahora parece que todo está bien, pero esperemos, puede haber novedades, todo dependerá de lo que piense la sra. camila parker bowles y lo que su amoroso esposo esté dispuesto a ofrendarle; incluso el libro de harry potter es una muestra de los bajos instintos ingleses, han trabajado el tema hasta las últimas consecuencias con el fin de obtener un lucro adicional a la venta de libros y su publicidad, lucro que aún no podemos vislumbrar; en fin, sólo podemos conjeturar, pero créanme, si le hubieran cuidado la vida, pero cuidado la vida en serio, la princesita jamás se habría muerto, es más, hoy sería la feliz madre de sus hijos con dody, pero no, no se la quisieron cuidar, la preferían muerta, bien muerta y muerta está. No creo que los ingleses paguen sus pecados en la otra vida, más bien creo que tenemos que tomar conciencia de lo capaces que son de rompernos nuestros sue?os y enfrentarlos y ponerlos en su lugar, nos debemos eso, en América al Sur nos debemos eso.|`|UyV3kiuiaa	en mi opinión si fue asesinada espero estar equivocada es algo horrible y ojala que el tiempo pueda de cifrar esta" ?

También deseo que los periodistas del mundo paren un momento y reflexionen sobre la forma y medios para lograr la noticia. Perdimos a una persona muy querida y se supone que en la libertad de prensa ganemos todos, no solo unos pocos.<br>  <br>  Descanse en paz la princesa Diana

MSKjp7oyaa	Antes de responder tengo que hacerte una peque?a observación, de lo contrario no podría responder tu pregunta porque pide una respuesta para 3 interrogantes diferentes y una comparación que considero (personalmente) falsa.<br>  En principio no creo que la felicidad dependa de la sinrazón o de tenerla. No creo que alguien que resigna la oposición de sus argumentos y deja sin demostrar la fuente de la veracidad de sus afirmaciones, por ese simple hecho, sea feliz. Mas bien lo contrario, creo que si alguien cree tener razón con argumentos y elementos de prueba, se debe sentir muy frustrado si no se atreve, no sabe, reprime, niega o no le permiten exponer sus razones. Luego abrimos el abanico de posibilidades y quizá en ese contexto veamos que algún otro aspecto de esta persona ri?e con lo racional o la busqueda de la razón y la negación o la sinrazón tienen algún sentido funcional, que entra en conflicto con la verdad o lo comprobable. Quizá esa persona necesite la tranquilidad de no saber o hacer que sabe de distinta manera, aún renunciando a su propia razón, en pos de la tranquilidad de cumplir con otras razones y de esta manera tener una sensación de satisfacción que no llega a dejarlo satisfecho pero lo aleja del conflicto... yo no encuentro felicidad en eso y creo que tampoco es felicidad.<br>  La segunda aclaración es que saber escuchar no implica que quién sabe hacerlo lo haga. Creo que el escuchar no tiene que ver con saber hacerlo, mas bien tengo la idea de que debe existir una predisposición a hacerlo, tiene que ver con la racionalidad y la solidez de quien acepta escuchar. Es una cuestión de actitud, alguien que valora el conocimiento y la experiencia, que se sabe preparado e intelectualmente cultivado, que no siente que respetar lo debilita y no necesita la ceguera de la intolerancia para saberse certero, alguien así es un interlocutor que atiende las razones de los demás, las escucha y las aprovecha, ya sea para refutarlas, aceptarlas o combinarlas con las propias.<br>  En tercer lugar esta última apreciación me llevan a la última observación, disposición a escuchar y saber escuchar. Esto tampoco es lo mismo. Una es un gesto y la otra es una capacidad. No todo el que acepta, accede, se propone o se impone escuchar al otro lo hace con actitud positiva, uno puede escuchar con soberbia o con interés, con prejuicio o con permeabilidad. Es muy amplio el expectro de posibilidades detrás de una mueca de supuesto interés en el decir del otro.<br>  <br>  Ahora respondo tu pregunta creyendo haber demostrado que virtualmente "la escuché" y con atención.<br>  Soy un amante del intercambio de ideas, no existe intercambio cuando alguien intenta imponer su criterio. Entiendo que hay ámbitos privados, de poder o de conducción, donde tiene mucho menos lugar el debate, pero soy un convencido de que incluso en ellos y entre quienes tienen que detentar, conservar e imponer su poder, es provechosa una actitud receptiva a las opiniones y propuestas de los demás. Incluso es saludable reconocer la razón en los demás aunque sea tu voluntad la que por una cuestión de autoridad o autoritarismo, deba primar. Seguramente es mas respetada la orden de alguien que muestra un proceso de fundamentación de sus desiciones y quizá sea obedecida con convicción y respeto, en vez de resignación y desgano.<br>  Entonces te respondo que creo saber escuchar, generalmente estoy dispuesto a hacerlo si me interesa y siento respeto por las opiniones y los modos de expresarlas que tiene el otro y considero que puedo ser muy feliz teniendo la razón o dándola cuando la tiene el otro.<br>  Por último, creo que nadie tiene razón, sino que algunos tenemos mejores argumentos y otros ni siquiera tienen una idea prestada, se limitan a repetir lo que se acuerdan y quizá lo que entendieron de lo que recuerdan.<br>  Saludos!|`|FnKUadBvaa	Estoy a favor de la razon.<br>  <br>  Pero quien tiene la razon si esta es relativa.<br>  <br>  La razon es de cada quien, hay que escuchar e intentar imponer tu criterio siempre que este acompa?ado de la razon. <br>  <br>  Muchas veces quien tiene la razon es el que sabe exponer mejor sus argumentos, en ese caso puede que al no tener nosotros mejores argumentos podemos ceder y dar la razon.<br>  <br>  Es confuso verdad espero que sea claro para ti.|`|X7zkzi53aa	?Cómo? ?Hablá más alto que no te escucho, flaco!|`|ZIrkCTikaa	Si escuchas mucho puedes oir lo inconveniente, si hablas de mas no escucharás tu intuicion.|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Se escuchar y soy feliz y y la razón va con la verdad.|`|fabcfb75718fffe4f4f7d8286d01be2baa	si se escuchar, es una forma de de ayudar a la gente con sus problemas|`|qjF7T9jNaa	Me encanta escuchar, e hacer cambiar de opinion a la persona a quien escucho... <br>  creo que es algo maravilloso poder imponer mi criterio sin peleas ni discuciones, escuchando y dandoles vueltas al asunto hasta que termino teniendo la razon...<br>  <br>  y eso me hace muy feliz!!!! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  suerte<br>  <br>  <br>  besos<br>  <br>  mua!|`|yxSXjlJUaa	pues yo soy una combinacion de escuchar, pero tambien de distraerme, cuando algun tema me interesa o cuando una persona me esta platicando cosas realmente serias, siento que si puedo escucharlos y estar atento para poder ver en que puedo ayudar o que puedo aprender, pero cuando algo es monotono o no me agrada, ese si que es mi gran defecto, me distraigo y pierto la atencion y ahora, ?imponer criterio? yo no hago eso o al menos no concientemente, lo que si hago con las personas con quienes platico, es opinar y darles mi punto de vista, si veo (segun yo) que es lo mejor, tal vez insista y si eso es querer tener la razon pues sip, tengo las dos cosas que se mencionan: puedo escuchar y a veces tambien quisiera tener la razon, pero bueno, cada cabecita es un mundo.<br>   lo unico que no me gustaria es hacer da?o con una de mis insistencias de querer tener la razon y tambien quisiera no distraerme tanto, porque pues si....es una falta de educacion, pero bueno, ya me tendre que aplicar.<br>  saludos|`|9GBiez15aa	Querida gente: por algo tenemos 2 oidos y 1 sola boca...saludos|`|fbopOGl3aa	Excelente pregunta, pienso que para que exista el diálogo primero debe existir el respeto, y éste se muestra precisamente al saber escuchar a nuestro prójimo.

Aqui te dejo un peque?o escrito acerca de la cruz:<br>  <br>  El interés que demuestran los escritores neotestamentarios en la cruz no es ni arqueológico ni histórico, sino cristológico. Les interesa el significado eterno, cósmico, y soteriológico de lo que ocurrió, una vez y para siempre, en la muerte de Jesucristo, el Hijo de Dios, en la cruz. Desde el punto de vista teológico, la palabra "cruz" se utilizó como descripción sumaria del evangelio de salvación, de que Jesús "murió por nuestros pecados". De modo que la "predicación del evangelio" es "la palabra de la cruz, la "predicación del Cristo crucificado" (1 Co. 1.17ss). Por ello el apóstol se gloría "en la cruz de nuestro Se?or Jesucristo", y habla de sufrir persecución "a causa de la cruz de Cristo". Resulta claro que la palabra "cruz" representa aquí el anuncio completo y jubiloso de nuestra redención por medio de la muerte expiatoria de Jesucristo.<br>  <br>  Visita éste link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amen-amen.net/estudiosbiblicos/cruz.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.amen-amen.net/estudiosbiblico...</a><br>  <br>  Aquí podrás ampliar tus conocimientos acerca del tema.<br>  <br>  Te dejo además estos otros, un poco más complejos si quieres profundizar aún más:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.urantia.org/spanish/es_docs/doc188.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.urantia.org/spanish/es_docs/d...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rosicrucian.com/foreign/mi/miespa01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rosicrucian.com/foreign/mi/mi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jesuscaritasinter/Viacrucis_de_la_Solidaridad_2003.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/jesuscaritasint...</a><br>  <br>  Espero que te sirva!|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Eso si, cada quien puede adorar lo que se le dela gana.|`|koZJVgCJaa	son muy raros........adoran un método de tortura|`|Yp8dlrmKaa	pues, no tengo mucha info sobre si adoran esa Cruz, o no.. pero igual, en todo el mundo, en Semana Santa, se hace una celebracion especial recordando la Cruz de donde pendó la Salvación del mundo...

Todas las religiones o creencias divinas tienen iglesias, dado que como la misma definición lo aclara, son las personas las que la forman. El problema, me parece, es que lo que realmente te molesta radica en la manipulación de datos e información que los miembros de las altas jerarquías de las iglesias hacen con sus feligreses o partidarios (como quieras decirle). Sin embargo, rectifico que no son las iglesias el problema, sino la lógica humana la que se pasea en todo. Ahora, Jesús sí existió y si fue humano, pero eso no le quita su carácter sobrenatural (que en esencia, todos lo tenemos). Por cierto, el Armagedón ya pasó, porque cuando fue escrito, hacía referencia de manera literaria a una situación en concreto que se vivía de manera política entre los judíos y los romanos. Y por cierto, el Armagedón (Apocalipsis o Revelación, como quiera llamarlo), al ser escrito con lenguaje literario, no puede ser interpretado textualmente, sino a través de sus simbolismos.|`|GnJSVFyFaa	respeto tu opinión y ahora respeta la mía:dentro de la Iglesia hay de todo,bueno y malo,claro está...la componen seres humanos y eso conlleva q no sea perfecta e incluso haya habido casos de corrupción...y para controlar esos casos,ya se encargan otros,no??entonces quedandonos con lo bueno de la Iglesia,pues como tú has dicho,cada persona debe tener un derecho para adorar a quien quiera.Pero si se trata de adorar a Dios y no existe la Iglesia...donde lo haremos??una cosa es q queramos q cambie en algo y otra q se destruya.Yo como creyente pienso q es el Templo de Dios y nunca debería ser destruído.Es mi opinión.|`|R42mYURYaa	Como conestar algo así?

Yo no soy una persona religiosa, no asisto a ninguna reunion, misa, etc.. precisamente porque no creo en la instituciones, pero a mi a mi juicio la religión(en el sentido de creer en algo)  es algo que hace bien el hombre, en el sentido que le apoya moralmente en conceptos que por nuestro entendimiento del mundo, en mi opinión bastante primitivo, se dan una explicacion, creíble o no, pero una explicación, que fuera de este ambito no tiene una explicacion razonable, al menos para el creyente. <br>  Los textos de todas las religiones, resaltan la necesidad de "ser buenos" y "ayudar al projimo" como base de la doctrina, por lo tanto entiendo que si se usa la fe con buenos fienes es para para hacer bien.<br>  <br>  Pero quizás esta fe, es facilmente vulnerable y utilizable por aquellas personas que pretendan sacar un provecho, disvirtuan los textos a sus intereses. (algo que no ocurre unicamente en la religion, sino en TODAS las actividades humanas existe alguien que interpreta, usa y utiliza unas normas o reglas para su unico beneficio.)<br>  <br>  Nada en este mundo es perfecto, ni creo que jamas lo sera, quizás en entendimiento, la tolerancia y una gran dosis de paciencia, algún día de fruto, y todo humano pueda convivir,  sea cual sea su credo, incluso si no tiene.<br>  <br>  En conclusion, usare una frase que siempre me ha gustado:<br>  "Vive y deja vivir"|`|Xp7FBbK6aa	nesecitamos una religion real.>><br>  <br>  <a href="http://religion-real.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://religion-real.blogspot.com/</a>|`|YRopk84daa	Es triste ver a personas aferradas a una clase de vida muy sumisa y flagelada debido a su religión y ver su caracter debil,  por que  alguien les dijo que alcanzaran el paraiso cuando se estan ocupando por  tan buscado paraiso que se olvidan de vivir y dejarle su fe a un Secta con bandera de religion, sin embargo yo no me preocupo por ninguna de estas pero si siento pena por estas personas, aunque personalmente si tengo fe  pero en mi y tambien creo o quiero creer que existe alguna fuerza positiva que me da valor en los momentos bajos de mi vida, aunque no creo en la gente que rige las religiones por que al fin y al cabo son personas como todas con defectos y virtudes y no creo que sean mejor que uno mismo, en vez de ir a rezar deberiamos hacer actos para ayudar al planeta y si esta a nuestro alcanze ,el apoyo moral  u otro que se pueda dar a las personas que lo necesitan en un momento dado, para sentirnos bien con nosotros mismos y nuestro entorno...Saludos a todos!|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Pues eso es lo que mas deseamos pero nada, hay que seguir esperando.|`|piVZRyNNaa	SI ES NESESARIO, PARA LA SOCIEDAD|`|vIiK6aVQaa	Cada persona desde su propia espiritualidad necesita creer en algo ya sea en una imagen, en un objeto, en un documento, ya que todos ellos constituyen simbolos de una idea que nos hacemos del mundo y que nos hemos venido haciendo desde que el hombre ha buscado explicacion a las cosas que le rodea. Desde el punto de vista filosofico-marxista, la religion enajena al hombre ya sea cristiana, budista o yoruba, para generalizar, cada cual tiene sus caracteristicas y esta en la mente de cada persona cual religion es la mas adecuada para sus propositos. En general todas las religiones son da?inas o beneficas desde el punto de vista que se mire y desde tu propia creencia, y si en estos momentos crees que no crees en algo o alguien, piensa si en algun momento pasado de tu vida que halla sido dificil has "pensado en algo o alguien" que te halla ayudado a salir adelante. Piensa que no es la Iglesia, sino, los hombres dentro de ella la que la han convertido es eso que aborreces.

7d8d467c23f140cf79a7086399881f76aa	Buena pregunta.<br>  <br>  ?Cómo llegaron los TJ a estas afirmaciones especulativas? ?por qué llegaron a creer todo esto?<br>  <br>  Es bueno apelar a la historia de la Sociedad Watchtower (Nota a)).<br>  <br>  Los testigos de Jehová (TJ) mantienen dogmas y especulaciones heredadas de los vínculos de su fundador (Nota b)) con el adventismo.<br>  <br>  De hecho, muchas explicaciones similares a la de los TJ se pueden encontrar en sitios adventistas. (Por ej. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikilearning.com/la_fecha_del_ano_1844-wkccp-1146-13.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikilearning.com/la_fecha_del...</a><br>  <br>  Russell al mismo tiempo combinó explicaciones similares con el cálculo de las medidas de la Gran Pirámide de Egipto, determinando que éstas llevaban a determinar la fecha de 1914 (?!).

Este argumento tiene relación con la costumbre de fijar muchas fechas como las posibles de la venida de Jesús (1914, 1918, 1925,1975).<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, es imposible que alguien te pruebe bíblicamente una fecha concreta para la venida de Jesús:<br>  <br>  i) La Biblia no habla de fechas del calendario gregoriano (el que utilizamos)<br>  <br>  ii) Jesús se?aló que cuando volviera, lo haría en el momento menos pensado.<br>  <br>  iii) Jesús no invita a seguir una fecha, más bien aconseja a que el cristiano se mantenga alerta o despierto.<br>  <br>  ?En qué basan sus explicaciones los TJ?<br>  <br>  En primer lugar, realizan una serie de especulaciones proféticas a partir del evangelio de Lucas 21:24.En dicha porción Jesús anuncia la destrucción de Jerusalén que ocurriría el a?o 70 d. J.C por los romanos. Sin embargo, los TJ interpretan que Jesús se refiere a la primera destrucción de Jerusalén por los babilonios. <br>  <br>  ?Curioso? <br>  Todavía no es lo más curioso.<br>  <br>  Los tiempos de los gentiles que menciona Jesús en el evangelio de Lucas los TJ lo explican usando el período de locura del rey babilonio Nabucodonosor (Daniel 4: 24, 25). Explican luego, que los 7 tiempos equivaldrían a 2520 a?os extrapolando los textos de Apocalipsis 12:6, 14 y Números 14:34.Dichos 7 tiempos comenzarían desde la destrucción de Jerusalén por los babilonios.<br>  <br>  ?Cuándo ocurrió dicha destrucción de Jerusalén? Según los TJ esto ocurrió el a?o 607 a. de J.C.<br>  <br>  ?De dónde sacaron esto si cualquier persona que tome una buena enciclopedia (Britannica, Americana), etc. sabe que este acontecimiento no ocurrió en dicha fecha? Sí, la destrucción de Jerusalén ocurrió el a?o 587-86 a. de J.C.<br>  <br>  Ver:<br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/babilonia" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/babilonia</a><br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/nabucodonosor_ii" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/nabucodonos...</a><br>  <br>  Sólo llegar a este punto, te permitirá ver que no puedes llegar a ningún cálculo correcto de ninguna fecha especial.<br>  <br>  Primero, porque se parte de especulaciones teológicas que ni siquiera Jesús nos anima a realizar.<br>  <br>  Segundo , porque dichas especulaciones se basan en premisas sin fundamento bíblico.<br>  <br>  Tercero, porque dichas explicaciones no tienen sustento histórico.<br>  <br>  Existen más problemas históricos y bíblicos en la explicación que dan los TJ. Incluso algunos editores de sus publicaciones ya son concientes de estas discrepancias, pero como se dice en jerga de negocios "su inversión se encuentra en un punto de no retorno". <br>  <br>  Ver cita textual de uno de sus libros en:<br>  <a href="http://espanol.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgUxX.WiuYGlGYC9T1Dh5LXZEQx.?qid=20070412145503AA6AWhO&show=7#profile-info-ab7f857385cfcaf01825d9aee56172f1aa">http://espanol.answers.yahoo.com/questio...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Es muy dificil que se haga un reconocimiento abierto de este error, porque han basado toda una argumentación doctrinal en torno a esta fecha (por ej. Jesús habría "venido" en 1918 y habría escogido a los TJ como la religión verdadera, durante mucho tiempo la "generación" de 1914 no iba a pasar hasta no ver el paraíso (doctrina que cambió en 1995), los TJ iban a separar a las ovejas y cabras porque Jesús había llegado como Rey desde 1914 (doctrina que cambió en 1995), etc.)Hay mucha más información que puedes consultar en:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.extj.org/607_cronologia_destruida.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.extj.org/607_cronologia_destr...</a><br>  <br>  (Sitio interesante con copias escaneadas de publicaciones de los propios TJ, Sociedad Watchtower, en los cuales hacen reconocimientos de errores en esta cronología, por cierto utilizando eufemismos. Te destaco esta referencia en vista de los argumentos de "copy-paste" usados por Victor Hugo en el que la Soc. Watchtower se atribuye usar pruebas bíblicas para hacer sus estimaciones proféticas)<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, durante casi todo el siglo XX la Sociedad Watchtower mantuvo a los testigos de Jehová con la expectación de la venida de Cristo y el Armagedón gracias a la idea de que aquellos que presenciaron o vivieron en 1914 no morirían sin ver estos acontecimientos.A medida que pasaba el tiempo más dramática y ansiosa se volvía la espera. Hasta que finalmente en 1994 (80 a?os desde 1914) decidieron cambiar la doctrina e incluso con ello reconocer humillados la observación crítica que ya había hecho un ex miembro del Cuerpo Gobernante de los testigos de Jehová, pero que había sido excomulgado por sus ideas (?qué sentirán los TJ si supieran que sus nuevos entendimientos corresponden a explicaciones dadas por alguien a quien ellos consideran "apóstata"?).Ver citas:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.escritosparalaconcordia.org/generacion.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.escritosparalaconcordia.org/g...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.escritosparalaconcordia.org/apendice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.escritosparalaconcordia.org/a...</a><br>  <br>  Lo más curioso de todo esto, es que pese a todo el tiempo transcurrido aún la Watchtower mantiene en su sitio oficial esta doctrina, pese a que uno podría pensar que el sitio es revisado y actualizado cada cierto tiempo. <br>  <br>  Ver la cita (en las primeras líneas de la sección "Educación para entrar en el paraíso"):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/s/lmn/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/s/lmn/index.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Suponiendo que a alguien le atrae esta opinión de los asuntos que se encuentra en el sitio oficial de Watchtower(pensar que los que vivieron en 1914 son los que marcan la pauta para la venida de Jesús), ?qué hará cuando le cuenten que ahora ya cambiaron la doctrina? Lo que es peor ?qué fue de todos aquellos cientos de miles que creyeron en estas promesas? ?cómo controlan su decepción?Sin embargo, para el resto de los cristianos en el mundo la fe y la esperanza puesta en la venida de Cristo no ha cambiado, al no dejarse llevar por la seducción de las sectas.<br>  <br>  Ver más en:<br>  <a href="http://www.escritosparalaconcordia.org/ccapitulo9.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.escritosparalaconcordia.org/c...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.escritosparalaconcordia.org/capitulo16.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.escritosparalaconcordia.org/c...</a><br>  <br>  Fuente(s):<br>  <br>  Nota:<br>  a) Sociedad Watchtower: empresa editorial que redacta los libros y revistas que contienen los dogmas y creencias de los testigos de Jehová.<br>  <br>  b) Charles Russell: Fundador de este movimiento religioso|`|3bf3b1a03ae558a8fbbb723f0f3755f4aa	MENTIRA ,, JESUS ESTA EN UNLUGAR LLAMADO PARAISO ,, EL QUE ESTA CON NOSOTROS ES EL ESPIRITUD SANTO,|`|41fc7f1fd75de3804683f56d513c55a4aa	Jesús no esta en la tierra, jamas vendrá, el hizo su papel que le encomendó su Padre y volvió a los cielos donde pertenece, su "venida "es de manera simbólica.?porque lo digo?<br>  Mat 24:30 Entonces aparecerá en el cielo la se?al del Hijo del hombre; y entonces se golpearán el pecho todas las razas de la tierra y verán al Hijo del hombre venir sobre las nubes del cielo con gran poder y gloria.<br>  Analicemos:<br>  1a habla de una "se?al" un indicativo<br>  2a?podríamos ver lo que esta por encima de una nube?<br>  veamos:(Hechos 1:9) 9?Y después que hubo dicho estas cosas, estando ellos mirando, fue elevado, y una nube se lo llevó de la vista de ellos..?.?.<br>  Solo lo veremos con los ojos del corazón.<br>  (RV95)  Todavía un poco,  y el mundo no me verá más,  pero vosotros me veréis;[16]  porque yo vivo,  vosotros también viviréis.<br>  Saludos|`|92f1a0a9690538de043c5e3f0fa8da04aa	Mira Jesus es el hijo berdadero y unico y sus promesas se cumpliran al pie de la letre ni una eje ni una tilde pasara delo que esta,' escrito  pues sus promesas son beraderas...asi como el rayo cruza del oriente al poniente asi sera su benida y todo ojo humano lo vera !! entonses todas la tribus de la tierra se gloriaran saludos y bendiciones|`|325uAz5baa	pues hay muchos Jesús , Jesús rodrigues , Jesús sargueta , Jesús ponce y muchos mas pero de que Jesucristo este en la tierra desde 1914 si que es invento de los que se hacen cuando uno esta bien borrachín osea viejo, puro alucine|`|4U3TmHqKaa	no creo que la 2o venida de Jesus sea igualitita que la 1o...<br>  y quien dice que esta desde 1914?<br>  Jesus vive entre nosotros "YO estaré con ustedes todos los días"(Mt, 28, 20)<br>  besos!|`|5w8ppU5daa	para todos los estúpidos ignorantes que abrieron la boca sin tener una idea exacta, les comento brevemente que los Testigos de Jehová NO creen NI ENSE?AN que Jesús este en la tierra desde 1914..........<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ducentesima drago phi tu!|`|M3V39s13aa	EL MAESTRO JESUS NO HA ENCARNADO DE NUEVO EN EL PLANO FISICO|`|QqDuARXLaa	No puras mentiras de los testigos de jehova|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Puras mentiras no creas nada, los que te dijeron eso te cuentearon como a un chino.|`|db209a122cdc8f1f0b0831ecb89f0b5faa	No es verdad!!

El saber más acerca de esta ciudad fortalecerá su convicción de que la Biblia es exacta y de que sus sorprendentes profecías se cumplirán sin falta.<br>  <br>  LA PODEROSA Babilonia estaba majestuosamente asentada sobre el río éufrates en la Mesopotamia meridional. Era una “decoración de reinos”, un centro religioso, comercial y militar. (Isaías 13:19.) Tenía grandes riquezas, magníficos edificios y jardines de fama mundial. ?Era la potencia mundial de sus tiempos!<br>  <br>  No obstante, el profeta Jeremías escribió por inspiración de Jehová: “Babilonia tiene que llegar a ser montones de piedras, albergue de chacales, objeto de pasmo y algo de qué silbar, sin habitante alguno”. (Jeremías 51:37.)<br>  <br>  ?Esta gran ciudad una ruina total? ?Quién pudiera imaginar tal cosa? Sin embargo, hoy la orgullosa Babilonia de la antigüedad es solo un cuadro desilusionador de desolados montículos de ruinas, unos 80 kilómetros al sur de Bagdad, en el sudeste de Iraq. ?Qué la llevó a tal caída?<br>  <br>  Babilonia, una de las ciudades más antiguas del mundo, fue fundada por un bisnieto de Noé, Nemrod, el poderoso cazador en desafío a Jehová. (Génesis 10:8-10.) Sin embargo, el período de su historia que nos interesa vino mucho después del tiempo de Nemrod. Vino después que tanto Egipto como Asiria habían sido las potencias dominantes del mundo.<br>  <br>  Babilonia en los días de Nabucodonosor<br>  <br>  Hace unos 2.600 a?os, allá en el a?o 632 a.E.C., los babilonios y sus aliados derribaron a Asiria. Babilonia entonces reemplazó a Asiria y llegó a ser la tercera gran potencia mundial de la historia bíblica.<br>  <br>  Nabucodonosor, quien subió al trono de este Imperio Neobabilónico (o de la Nueva Babilonia) no fue solo un conquistador; también construyó ciudades. Las poderosas murallas de Babilonia y sus impresionantes edificios se pueden atribuir principalmente a él. Se han hallado grandes cantidades de ladrillos que llevan el nombre “Nabucodonosor”... el del mismo Nabucodonosor mencionado tan frecuentemente en los libros bíblicos de Jeremías y Daniel, el Nabucodonosor cuya jactancia cita la Biblia: “?No es esta Babilonia la Grande, la cual yo mismo he construido [...]?”. (Daniel 4:30.)<br>  <br>  Dos grandes murallas rodeaban a Babilonia, y el espacio entre ellas estaba lleno de cascajo. Juntas, hacían una barrera de más de 24 metros de espesor. Fuera de las murallas, embarcaciones de todo tipo usaban un foso inundado de 20 a 80 metros de ancho cuya fachada interior estaba revestida de ladrillos.<br>  <br>  La carretera que bajaba del norte cruzaba la Puerta de Istar y entraba en la arteria principal de la ciudad, la amplia Vía Procesional. El palacio de Nabucodonosor estaba a la derecha, con entrada por la Puerta de Istar. Su enorme sala del trono medía 17 por 52 metros. La puerta y las murallas que conducían a ella estaban adornadas con representaciones de leones, toros y dragones en ladrillo esmaltado de brillantes colores. En el Museo del Louvre, en París, Francia, hay una de estas representaciones en exhibición.<br>  <br>  La religión babilónica<br>  <br>  El nombre hebreo de la ciudad —Babel— significa “confusión”, mientras que los nombres sumerio y acadio que se le dan significan “Puerta de Dios”. Ambos significados enlazan a Babilonia con su religión. Algunos doctos creen que el dios babilonio Marduk (Merodac en la Biblia) puede haber sido Nemrod deificado. La religión babilónica también reconocía a varias tríadas de dioses. Una de estas se componía de Sin (el dios lunar), Shamash (el dios solar) e Istar (la diosa del amor y la fertilidad).<br>  <br>  La astrología dominaba allí. Los babilonios dieron a los planetas entonces conocidos los nombres de sus cinco dioses y diosas principales. Una obra histórica moderna explica: “Llamamos a estos planetas por sus nombres romanos, pero los romanos habían adoptado los términos babilónicos y simplemente los habían traducido por sus equivalentes romanos. Así, el planeta que correspondía a Istar, la diosa del amor, se convirtió en Venus, y el que correspondía al dios Marduk fue cambiado a Júpiter”. El nombre “caldeo”, con referencia a los babilonios, casi se hizo sinónimo de “astrólogo”.<br>  <br>  La Biblia dice que Babilonia era “una tierra de imágenes esculpidas” y de inmundos “ídolos estercolizos”. (Jeremías 50:2, 38.) Sin embargo, sus ideas religiosas fueron la fuente principal de otras religiones de todo el mundo. El profesor Morris Jastrow dice en The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria: “En el mundo antiguo, antes de que surgiera el cristianismo, Egipto, Persia y Grecia sintieron la influencia de la religión babilónica”. Posteriormente, muchas de aquellas ideas falsas fueron aceptadas y ense?adas hasta en las iglesias de la cristiandad. Por eso la Biblia llama “Babilonia la Grande” al imperio mundial de la religión falsa. (Revelación 17:3-5.)<br>  <br>  Jerusalén capturada por Babilonia<br>  <br>  El profeta Isaías vivía cuando Asiria, la segunda potencia mundial, dominó al mundo antiguo. Sin embargo, Dios hizo que por inspiración Isaías profetizara que Jerusalén no sería destruida por los asirios, que dominaban entonces, sino por los babilonios. (Isaías 39:6, 7.) ?Se cumplió esta profecía? Veamos.<br>  <br>  Fue un siglo después del tiempo de Isaías cuando Babilonia y sus aliados conquistaron a Asiria, y Babilonia ascendió a la posición de nueva potencia mundial. Entonces, en 617 a.E.C., Nabucodonosor el rey de Babilonia capturó al rey Joaquín de Jerusalén y lo envió con otros “hombres de nota del país” al cautiverio en Babilonia. Nabucodonosor hizo rey en Jerusalén a Matanías y “cambió el nombre de este al de Sedequías”. (2 Reyes 24:11-17.)<br>  <br>  Los propios registros babilónicos hallados por arqueólogos también confirman ese acontecimiento. La Crónica Babilónica —antiguas tablillas de barro con el registro de acontecimientos importantes— dice que el rey de Babilonia “sitió a la ciudad de Judá [Jerusalén], y [...] tomó la ciudad y capturó al rey. Instaló allí a un rey escogido por él, recibió su pesado tributo y (los) envió a Babilonia”.<br>  <br>  La Biblia menciona además la porción designada de alimento que se dio a Joaquín mientras estuvo en el exilio en Babilonia. (2 Reyes 25:27-30.) Los arqueólogos han hallado en Babilonia documentos administrativos que mencionan la porción de alimento que se dio tanto a “Joaquín, rey” como a los “hijos del rey de Judá”.<br>  <br>  Aunque el pueblo de Jerusalén estaba en relación de pacto con Jehová Dios, todavía rehusó tercamente seguir los caminos de Dios y escuchar a sus profetas. Jehová dijo que habían ‘endurecido su cerviz para no obedecer Sus palabras’. Por medio de Jeremías advirtió que “a todo Judá daré en mano del rey de Babilonia, y él realmente los llevará al destierro en Babilonia y los derribará a espada”. (Jeremías 19:15; 20:4.)<br>  <br>  Así sucedió que, cuando Sedequías se rebeló contra Nabucodonosor, los babilonios regresaron y sitiaron a Jerusalén. Irrumpieron por sus muros el 9 de Tamuz de 607 a.E.C. Quemaron el templo, derribaron las murallas de la ciudad y se llevaron al cautiverio en Babilonia a Sedequías y a la mayoría del pueblo. Ciertamente se cumplieron estas palabras de Jehová: “Y toda esta tierra tiene que llegar a ser un lugar devastado, un objeto de pasmo, y estas naciones tendrán que servir al rey de Babilonia setenta a?os”. (Jeremías 25:11.)<br>  <br>  La imagen del sue?o de Nabucodonosor<br>  <br>  Después se dio a Nabucodonosor el rey de Babilonia, cabeza de la potencia mundial de sus tiempos, información extraordinaria. Dios le dio un sue?o acerca de una imagen inmensa. El sue?o fue una revelación que delineó la historia mundial pasando desde el tiempo de Nabucodonosor al de las potencias mundiales que le sucedieron —Medopersia y Grecia— y adelante a la época de Roma, y a más allá de nuestro tiempo, hasta cuando el Reino de Dios reemplace para siempre a todos los gobiernos humanos. Daniel, el profeta de Dios, dijo a Nabucodonosor: “El magnífico Dios mismo ha hecho saber al rey lo que ha de ocurrir después de esto. Y el sue?o es confiable, y la interpretación de él es digna de confianza”. (Daniel 2:28-45.)<br>  <br>  Nabucodonosor también tuvo que aprender como lección personal —y sacudidora— que Dios puede intervenir en tales asuntos mundiales... que “el Altísimo es Gobernante en el reino de la humanidad, y que a quien él quiere darlo lo da”. (Daniel 4:25.)<br>  <br>  Predicha la desolación de Babilonia<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, la crueldad que hasta el exceso Babilonia había manifestado para con el pueblo de Jehová no quedaría sin su castigo. Mediante Jeremías, Dios había dicho: “Y ciertamente pagaré a Babilonia y a todos los habitantes de Caldea toda su maldad que han cometido en Sión ante los ojos de ustedes”. Y mediante Isaías había predicho: “Voy a despertar contra ellos a los medos”. (Jeremías 51:24; Isaías 13:17.)<br>  <br>  Con unos dos siglos de anticipación, Jehová hasta dio el nombre del caudillo que derribaría a Babilonia y liberaría a Su pueblo... Ciro, también conocido como Ciro el Grande. La profecía acerca de Ciro decía que estarían abiertas “delante de él las puertas de dos hojas, de modo que las puertas mismas no estén cerradas”. (Isaías 44:26–45:1.) ?Fue así? La historia contesta.<br>  <br>  ?Cae Babilonia!<br>  <br>  Cuando estaban por vencerse los 70 a?os de cautiverio que se habían predicho para el pueblo judío, ya los medos y los persas marchaban a la conquista. Nabonido, el rey de Babilonia, había huido de Ciro en el campo de batalla. Heródoto, historiador griego, dice que los babilonios estaban listos para resistir un asedio larguísimo. Y aparentemente confiaban mucho en las poderosas murallas de Babilonia.<br>  <br>  Como lo relata la Biblia, en la noche del 5 al 6 de octubre del a?o 539 a.E.C. Belsasar estuvo celebrando un gran banquete en Babilonia, y ofrecía vino y alimento a mil huéspedes ensalzados. (Daniel 5:1-4.) Heródoto confirma que en Babilonia había una fiesta aquella noche. Dice que los habitantes de la ciudad “se hallaban bailando y divirtiéndose en sus convites y festines”. Afuera, sin embargo, Ciro había desviado las aguas del éufrates, que pasaban por el mismo centro de la ciudad. Cuando las aguas bajaron, su ejército marchó por el lecho del río, pasó a más allá de las elevadas murallas y entró por lo que Heródoto llamó “las puertas peque?as que miran al río”, puertas que los babilonios habían dejado abiertas.<br>  <br>  Muchos a?os antes, el profeta Jeremías había escrito una descripción gráfica de la caída de Babilonia: “Los hombres poderosos de Babilonia han cesado de pelear. [...] Corre un correo al encuentro de otro correo, y un informante al encuentro de otro informante, para informar al rey de Babilonia que su ciudad ha sido tomada en todo extremo, y que se han apoderado de los vados mismos, y han quemado con fuego los barcos de papiro”. (Jeremías 51:30-32.)<br>  <br>  La Crónica de Nabonido, ahora en el Museo Británico, confirma esta descripción. Dice que “el ejército de Ciro entró en Babilonia sin combate”.<br>  <br>  Se cumple la profecía de Jehová<br>  <br>  En una sola noche Babilonia había caído. De súbito había dejado de funcionar la tercera potencia mundial de la historia bíblica. Ciro pudo jactarse en un documento cuneiforme, conocido como el Cilindro de Ciro: “Soy Ciro, rey del mundo, gran soberano, monarca legítimo, rey de Babilonia, rey de Sumer”. Poco después, Ciro emitió su famoso decreto, y unos 50.000 cautivos judíos regresaron para reconstruir a Jerusalén y el templo de Jehová, y llegaron a aquel lugar precisamente al fin de los predichos 70 a?os de cautiverio. (Esdras 1:1-11.)<br>  <br>  Siglos después, Pedro, apóstol de Jesús, fue a ense?ar a una comunidad judía que florecía allí, y desde Babilonia Pedro escribió por lo menos una de sus cartas inspiradas que se hallan en la Biblia. (1 Pedro 5:13.) Sin embargo, con el tiempo se cumplió la profecía: “Y Babilonia, la decoración de reinos, la hermosura del orgullo de los caldeos, tiene que llegar a ser como cuando Dios derribó a Sodoma y Gomorra. Nunca será habitada”. (Isaías 13:19, 20.)<br>  <br>  Hoy la poderosa Babilonia es solo montículos de polvo y piedras, ruinas en un desierto... testimonio silencioso y elocuente de la exactitud infalible de la Palabra profética de Jehová. (Jeremías 51:36, 37.)|`|twm9pAGOaa	Las que supuestamente se cumplieron ahí...

EL SOLO NOS OBSERVA DE PASO SABE QUE ERRAMOS PERO NOS DA LAS HERRAMIENTAS PARA SER DIFERENTES, PARA SER COMO EL, PARA ENCONTRAR EL VERDADERO CAMINO QUE NOS HARá SER DIFERENTES. SI NOS DIO LIBRE ALBEDRíO Y POR ESO NOS ESTAMOS DESTRUYENDO, PORQUE HACEMOS DE NUESTRO MUNDO LO QUE QUEREMOS QUE SEA! SI NO NOS HUBIERAN ENGA?ADO CON TANTA MENTIRA PUEDES ESTAR SEGURO QUE NUESTRO MUNDO NO ESTARíA COMO ESTA!

Pero en Inglaterra la iglesia que se opuso a Darwin, no fue la catolica sino la anglicana.<br>  <br>  La iglesia catolica hoy por hoy no se opone a la teoria de la Evolución. Tampoco la iglesia anglicana que si se opuso en esa epoca. Actualmente los que se oponen son los grupos fundamentalistas de USA.<br>  <br>  Ahora ?Por que la iglesia de Inglaterra se oponia a ese libro...? La respuesta es soprendente.... por geologia. En aquella epoca justo antes de Darwin muchos geologos habían concluido que la tierra tenía que ser mas antigua de los 6000 a?os que decía la Biblia. A los clerigos ingleses esto no les gustó y había una pugna muy fuerte entre ellos. <br>  <br>  Así que Darwin estaba hechando mas le?a al fuego.

La dificultad se aclara si tenemos en cuenta que el libro del Génesis no pretende explicar "científicamente" el origen del universo ni la aparición del hombre sobre la tierra. Con las expresiones literarias y los símbolos propios de la época en que fueron escritos, esos textos bíblicos nos invitan a reconocer a Dios como el único Creador y Se?or de todas las cosas. Este reconocimiento nos hace ver el mundo, no como el resultado de una ciega fatalidad, sino como el ámbito creado por Dios para realizar en él su Alianza de amor con los hombres. La consumación de esa Alianza serán el "cielo nuevo" y la "tierra nueva" (Is. 65. 17; Apoc. 21. 1) inaugurados por la Resurrección de Cristo, que es el principio de una nueva creación.

Es esto lo que el autor quiere resaltar en los primeros pasajes del Génesis porque en su época había una cosmovisión errada, totalmente diferente de la actual.  El hombre antiguo personificaba la naturaleza y sus fuerzas como seres divinos, es decir, los fenómenos naturales se pensaban en término de la experiencia humana.  Por tanto la divinidad era pluripersonal.  <br>  <br>  Así también los filósofos griegos creían en la primacía de lo racional y especulativo por encima de lo intuitivo e incoherente, y por tanto elevaban los procesos de la razón a una posición de autonomía, por lo tanto para la mayoría Dios ya no está en la naturaleza y ha desaparecido por completo del horizonte de la realidad.

Orar es una comunicación, un compartir un dar. Creo que Dios creó el universo y que este esta "vivo" o funcionando para que se genere y mantenga la vida. La Tierra, es un planeta vivo, posee un núcleo, una corteza , una atmósfera, una rotación y una inclinación que en conjunto hacen este pedacito de universo entre MUUUUUUCHOS otros lugares, el único que es habitable. Que no haya terremotos como en la luna, un núcleo inexistene o muerto, En la luna no hay huracanes, ni tsunamis, ni tornados. Qué bien!!! (pero tampoco hay agua, ni nubes, ni una brisa!!!) Este sistema de vida, este habitat genera todos estos fenomenos o eventos NATURALES. NUESTRA imprudencia al habitar zonas de riesgo es lo que genera las TRAGEDIAS.  Por otra parte, orar no es un mecanismo infalible de convencer a Dios que cumpla nuestros caprichos o necesidades específicas o solucione NUESTROS PROBLEMAS, orar es COMPARTIRLE NUESTRA VIDA PORQUE LO AMAMOS! y PORQUE QUEREMOS ENTENDER CóMO VIVIR COMO HERMANOS!!

f4d08bc5fd4033beb9aa78576596aaa2aa	Excelente pregunta Christian!. Efectivamente has tocado un punto muy importante. Los creyentes dicen que dios nos ha dado libre albedrio para hacer como nos plazca. Lo particular es que tambien nos advierten que al morir el juzgara nuestros actos. Es entonces eso libre albedrio?. Tecnicamente yo lo llamaria "libre albedrio temporal" que es como decir que uno tiene libertad de hacer lo que quiera solo durante un ratito. Es como si el alcalde de la ciudad te dijera "sal a la calle y haz lo que quieras ah pero no se te olvide que tengo camaras vigilandote y me dare cuenta si fuiste a los lugares que te tengo prohibidos y entonces cuando vuelvas a casa te castigare severamente". Seria eso libre albedrio? yo creo que no. Quiza el alcalde nos prohibio sitios a los que no DEBERIAMOS ir y eso no esta mal, pero al vigilarnos y amenazarnos con un castigo por definicion esta violando parte de nuestra libertad. A veces un buen padre o un buen alcalde tiene que restringir nuestra libertad e insisto eso no estaria mal, pero tecnicamente seria un error llamarlo libre albedrio. Bueno con dios es algo peor, porque al menos con el alcalde uno podria irse de la ciudad si es que uno quiere irse a otro lado donde sea 100% libre, pero con dios no puedes porque si te"vas" de la vida (te suicidas) es peor y habra un castigo todavia mayor!!!. Realmente es gracioso pensar en llamar libre albedrio a que te digan "puedes creer en el dios que quieras, pero si no crees en mi te castigare por toda la eternidad" y como de dios no te puedes escapar (eso dicen los creyentes) pues que libre albedrio ni que cuentos, tienes que creer en el y ya esta, la otra opcion es (como me dice un amigo que me pasara a mi) "quemarte en las llamas del infierno".<br>  Christian, como puedes ver creer en dios implica aceptar ciertas inconsistencias e incluso ciertas arbitrariedades. Quiza lo mejor seria cuestionarse, en serio existe un ser asi? yo creo que no... <br>  Decia el escritor frances Jules Renard "Desconozco si Dios existe, pero sería mejor para su reputación que no existiera".|`|5c5fe7228b5757682e42619a2b92206daa	no te obliga, solo te amenaza con cuanta tonteria , que al final de cuentas es lo mismo, es como si yo le dijera a alguien dame todo tu dinero o te mato, ?no seria obligarlo??????|`|bBLiaSpNaa	Realmente que Dios no "obliga" a nadie, El desea que lo busquemos por nuestra propia voluntad. <br>  Dios te bendiga.|`|2S37W3IGaa	que le puede solicitar el amor del amor, solo que despiertes|`|72fcf0440646d03c08492da719343b54aa	Ves lo que provoca un libro viejo y lleno de basura humana.<br>  <br>  Si la Biblia hubiera sido escrita en el cielo no leerías en ella semejantes tonterías y atrocidades.<br>  <br>  Dios no te necesita para nada ni espera que creas en él ni necesita que le hagas favorcitos.<br>  <br>  Si vives toda tu vida siendo una buena persona que nunca necesitó de una Biblia ni de un pastorcito para saber lo que es bueno y lo que es malo ESO SE DEBE A QUE DIOS YA ESCRIBIó EN TU CORAZóN LO QUE éL DESEABA COMUNICARTE A TI.<br>  <br>  Sólo si es tu decisión ser una mala persona el día de tu muerte no recibirás un castigo sino que tu misma alma negra no BUSCARá A DIOS Y SE PERDERá POR LA ETERNIDAD NO COMO CASTIGO DE DIOS SINO POR SER UNA DECISION TUYA RECHAZAR LA VIDA DE DIOS.|`|Q7rCRKVYaa	Analiza bien lo que dices, esta muy enredado, empero por ahi va la cosa.|`|af2ed9b73fba38be70ddbdd5beddb7d6aa	jajaja Dios no te obliga a nada, tu decides, una cosa es k existan los mandamientos y k tu quieras seguirlos pero pork tu quieres, pero no creo k este detras de ti diciendote k tienes k seguirlos, eso tu ya lo sabrás, así k no te agobies TU DECIDES|`|2X6ZrSspaa	El cielo no es un lugar en si ( como si dijeras París o Japón) el cielo es Dios mismo.

Por lo que muchos aquí escriben, me doy cuenta de que piensan que tener "libre albedrío" significa hacer lo que a uno se le ocurra y no es así.<br>  Te explico: en la Edad Media, surgió una secta (los jansenistas) que pensaba así: "si Dios es omnisciente, es decir, que todo lo sabe, entonces sabe que yo me salvaré o me condenaré, eso ya está escrito y, por lo tanto, viva como viva, ya estoy salvado o condenado de antemano ?para qué hecer méritos, entonces?" Es a este pensamiento que se opone el concepto de "libre albedrío". Dios establece las reglas del juego para tu salvación o condenación. Tú eres libre de cumplirlas o no, o sea, eres tú, con tu decisión libre, quien te condenas o te salvas.<br>  Si quieres ir al cielo, como dices, sí, estás obligado a cumplir su palabra.

7d8d467c23f140cf79a7086399881f76aa	Frente a este tema, como en otros, la Sociedad Watchtower (SW) mantiene un lenguaje ambigüo.<br>  <br>  Por un lado, se?alan que no son infalibles, que sus interpretaciones bíblicas pueden no ser exactas y estar sujetas a "nueva luz" o entendimiento.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, por otro lado, usan sus propias interpretaciones o especulaciones como verdaderos dogmas incuestionables. Por ejemplo, nadie dentro de los testigos de Jehová podría poner en duda la forma de cálculo y sus conclusiones para asegurar que 1914 ó 1918-19 son fechas claves. Esto debido a que han construido toda una ideología religiosa en torno a dichas especulaciones y, a través de ellas, la jerarquía de la SW sostiene su autoridad sobre los TJ.<br>  <br>  Un asunto interesante, es que los nuevos miembros del llamado "Cuerpo Gobernante" o "Esclavo fiel y discreto", ha comenzado a introducir ideas que darían a entender a los adeptos TJ, que las creencias que sostienen poseen procedencia divina o inspirada.

41fc7f1fd75de3804683f56d513c55a4aa	. Se advierte claramente que el lenguaje a través de todo el relato es simbólico y, en vista de los pasajes precedentes, no puede interpretarse de forma literal. Nótese, sin embargo, que el "rico" de la parábola fue "sepultado" en el Hades, lo que viene a subrayar el hecho de que el Hades es la sepultura común de la humanidad.<br>  La voz griega pa·ra·bo·le (literalmente, "colocación al lado; yuxtaposición") tiene un significado más amplio que las palabras espa?olas "proverbio" y "parábola". El término "ilustración", sin embargo, tiene un significado amplio, que puede englobar la "parábola" y, en muchos casos, el "proverbio". Un "proverbio" encierra una verdad en lenguaje expresivo, a menudo de manera metafórica, y una "parábola" es una comparación o símil, una narración corta, generalmente ficticia, de la que se puede obtener una verdad moral o espiritual.<br>  Hay dos conceptos erróneos generales que pueden dificultar el entendimiento de las ilustraciones de la Biblia. Uno es el punto de vista de que tan solo son buenas historias, ejemplos o lecciones. Por ejemplo, muchos creen que la parábola del hijo pródigo no es más que una excelente composición literaria, y la ilustración del hombre rico y Lázaro, un ejemplo de recompensa y castigo después de la muerte.<br>  <br>  Puede mencionarse a este respecto que aunque las ilustraciones se extraen de la vida y de la naturaleza, no necesariamente acontecieron en realidad. Si bien algunas ilustraciones empiezan con expresiones como: "Una vez", "Un hombre tenía", "Había un hombre", "Cierto hombre era", u otras similares, se concibieron bajo la influencia del espíritu de Dios, y no eran más que lo que se les llamó: ilustraciones o parábolas. (Jue 9:8; Mt 21:28, 33; Lu 16:1, 19.) Sobre Jesucristo se dice: "Todas estas cosas habló Jesús a las muchedumbres por ilustraciones. En verdad, sin ilustración no les hablaba". (Mt 13:34; Mr 4:33, 34.)<br>  El rico representa a los líderes religiosos a quienes se ha favorecido con privilegios y oportunidades espirituales, y Lázaro representa a la gente común que está hambrienta de alimentación espiritual. Jesús continúa su narración y describe un cambio dramático en las circunstancias de estos hombres.<br>  <br>  "Pues bien, con el pasar del tiempo -dice Jesús- el mendigo murió, y fue llevado por los ángeles a la posición del seno de Abrahán. También, el rico murió y fue sepultado. Y en el Hades él alzó los ojos, mientras existía en tormentos, y vio de lejos a Abrahán y a Lázaro en la posición del seno con él."<br>  <br>  Puesto que el rico y Lázaro no son personas literales, sino que simbolizan a clases de personas, lógicamente la muerte de ellos es simbólica también. ?Qué simboliza o representa su muerte?<br>  <br>  Jesús acaba de indicar un cambio de circunstancias al decir que 'la Ley y los Profetas fueron hasta Juan el Bautizante, pero desde entonces se declara el reino de Dios'. Como se ve, con la predicación de Juan y Jesucristo tanto el rico como Lázaro mueren a sus circunstancias o condición de antes.<br>  <br>  Los de la clase humilde y penitente representada por Lázaro mueren a su condición anterior de privación espiritual, y entran en una posición de favor divino. Mientras que antes habían acudido a los líderes religiosos por lo poco que caía de la mesa espiritual, ahora las verdades bíblicas que Jesús da satisfacen su necesidad. Así, los de esa clase son llevados a la posición del seno, o favorecida, del Abrahán Mayor, Jehová Dios.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, los que componen la clase del rico llegan a estar bajo el desagrado divino por negarse tenazmente a aceptar el mensaje del Reino que Jesús ense?a. Así mueren a su posición anterior de favor aparente. De hecho, se dice que están en tormento figurativo. Ahora, oiga mientras el rico habla:<br>  <br>  "Padre Abrahán, ten misericordia de mí y envía a Lázaro para que moje la punta de su dedo en agua y refresque mi lengua, porque estoy en angustia en este fuego llameante". Los mensajes ardientes de juicio proclamados por los discípulos de Jesús son lo que atormenta a los individuos de la clase del rico. Ellos desean que los discípulos cesen de declarar estos mensajes, porque eso les daría algún alivio de sus tormentos.<br>  <br>  "Pero Abrahán dijo: 'Hijo, acuérdate de que recibiste de lleno tus cosas buenas en tu vida, pero Lázaro correspondientemente las cosas perjudiciales. Ahora, sin embargo, él tiene consuelo aquí, pero tú estás en angustia. Y además de todas estas cosas, se ha fijado una gran sima entre nosotros y ustedes, de modo que los que quieran pasar de aquí a ustedes no pueden, ni se puede cruzar de allá a nosotros'."<br>  <br>  ?Cuán justo y apropiado el que haya ese claro cambio de condiciones entre la clase representada por Lázaro y la representada por el rico! El cambio de condiciones se efectúa pocos meses después, en el Pentecostés de 33 E.C., cuando el antiguo pacto de la Ley es reemplazado por el nuevo pacto. Entonces se hace evidente, sin lugar a dudas, que Dios favorece a los discípulos, no a los fariseos ni a otros líderes religiosos. Por lo tanto, la "gran sima" que separa al simbólico rico y los discípulos de Jesús representa el juicio inmutable y justo de Dios.<br>  <br>  Después el rico solicita del "padre Abrahán": 'Envía a Lázaro a la casa de mi padre, porque tengo cinco hermanos'. Así el rico confiesa que tiene una relación más estrecha con otro padre, quien en realidad es Satanás el Diablo. El rico ruega que Lázaro modere los mensajes de juicio de Dios para que sus "cinco hermanos", sus aliados religiosos, no lleguen a estar "en este lugar de tormento".<br>  <br>  "Pero Abrahán dijo: 'Tienen a Moisés y a los Profetas; que escuchen a estos'." Sí, para que los "cinco hermanos" escapen del tormento, todo lo que tienen que hacer es prestar atención a los escritos de Moisés y los Profetas que identifican a Jesús como el Mesías y entonces hacerse discípulos de él. Pero el rico presenta una objeción: "No, por cierto, padre Abrahán, pero si alguien va a ellos de entre los muertos se arrepentirán".<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, se le dice: "Si no escuchan a Moisés y a los Profetas, tampoco se dejarán persuadir si alguien se levanta de entre los muertos". Dios no proveerá se?ales ni milagros especiales para convencer a la gente. La gente tiene que leer y aplicar las Escrituras si quiere obtener su favor. (Lucas 16:14-31; Juan 9:28, 29; Mateo 19:3-9; Gálatas 3:24; Colosenses 2:14; Juan 8:44.)|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Una historia muy bonita y triste.|`|hJjrDafVaa	Mi estimado amigo: la parábola no es de Juan sino de Lucas y se encuentra en 16.19-31.

Los católicos y los cristianos en general, aceptan al Cristo como un engendro del dios judío.<br>  ?Puede decirse que es aberración de un dios, que haya "pre?ado" a una de sus hijas?.

En cambio Jesus es divino y se hizo hombre para rescatarnos a nosotros los seres humanos. Jesus es desde el principio, no tiene genealogia. La genealogia que se presenta en la Biblia, es para testimonio de que generacion iba a venir humanamente. Pero la verdad es que no tiene porque el vino del cielo y no tuvo padre humano, mas Maria como dije anteriormente fue el medio que Dios uso para que en un cuerpo humano el naciera como nosotros, con todas las cualidades humanas, para que asi se probara que uno nacido de mujer podia cumplir con la ley y los mandamientos a fin de darnos a nosotros la oportunidad de que se puede llegar al reino de Dios.|`|N1rRN2NJaa	muy buena pregunta, si Jesucristo fue engendrado por maría y DIOS ?de que otra manera puede ser? del mismo modo que fuiste engendrado tu|`|XsA14rvIaa	MI ESTIMADO, USA TU DICCIONARIO SI|`|eJ0XdDUqaa	Significa que fue parido, dios no lo puso en la tierra asi como asi (aunque pudo haberlo hecho xP)|`|k5RAglYDaa	si, engendrado por la Virgen Maria, pero creado por Dios Por que ella no tubo relaciones sexuales...por eso de virgen.<br>  Y eso de ENGENDRO entonce todos lo somos por que todos fuimos engendrados, no t parece?|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Y del mal,je,je.

Jeans don't look good on everyone but if someone is slim and the jeans fit well, jeans can be nice and comfortable. <br>   <br>  You can get a pair of Armani jeans and feel good because of the material. Not all jeans are stiff and don't fit right. Try to buy an expensive pairs then you can tell the different. <br>  <br>  Lots of other brands such as Citizens of Humanity, 7 For All Mankind, or True Religion are a little more than an average pair of jeans but they fit better and feel better.|`|d948d15ef6fbc6d34c7a447b90f55f15aa	I find them comfortable.  I dont like sweatpants, everything feels like its out in the open down there.  I like the stiff.  I dont mind no zippers because I barely ever wear pants with zippers.  I like the colors (except faded light) but I never get patterns, just regular jeans.  As for the price I usually pay $30 for jeans.  They are just jeans so I'm will to buy them in cheap places like Target.  Anyone who pays over $50 is a sucker but thats just my opinion.|`|7374ccd6796a9a84df7f2c9362ae045caa	Jeans are comfortable!  I love them.  I wear them every day.  I love them because they ARE comfortable.  Sure, you can have uncomfortable jeans, but only if you buy a pair that doesn't fit you right.  Definately zipper over button fly.<br>  <br>  They are practical.  They are durable, and you can wash & wear them for as many years as you fit in to them.

Living here in Spain, i managed to meet people of different faiths which is a great opportunity to learn and co-exist peacefully. However, living in a non-muslim country, i need to adapt the different ways of living here. An example is that I miss some of the salah prayers since people here don't give a "break time" for praying salat on a wide scale. <br>  Fortunatley, these problems are only small. As long as Allah/God, The Merciful and Beneficient is guiding me, I am at peace.|`|QWqYVQ9Raa	I'm buying my boyfriend a sherbet fountain.

La cronología bilica indica que la ciudad cayo en la primera mitad del siglo XV a E.C.. Después de la conquista, Jericó fue quemada completamente y luego quedo deshabitada por centenares de a?os (Reyes 16:34) Antes de la II Guerra mundial el profesor John Garstang excavo donde se creía que había estado Jericó, descubrió que la ciudad de aquel lugar era muy antigua y que había sido destruida y reedificada muchas veces. Hallo que los muros habían caido por un terremoto y la ciudad había sido quemada completamente, Garstang, supuso que esto había ocurrido alrededor de 1400 a?os a.E.C. una fecha que no dista de la fecha biblica para la destrucción de Jericó. Luego de la guerra, la arqueologa Kathleen Kenyon hixo otras excavaciones en Jericó y llego a la conclusión acerca de estos muros desplomados e identificados eran centenares a?os mas antiguo de lo que se creía , la destrucción grande de Jericó fue en el siglo XV a.E.C...<br>  La arqueología ni aprueba ni refuta la Biblia, tiene otra función, determina y recobra el mundo material que se da por supuesto en la Biblia. Nos provee de información acerca de con que material se construyo una casa, o la apariencia de un lugar alto y permite comprender mejor los textos, en segundo lugar rellena el registro historico , la de Estela la moabita da el otro lado de la historia de 2 Reyes 3:4 y versículos siguientes.En tercer lugar revela la vida y el pensar  de los vecinos en la antiguedad. (Ebla - A Revelation in Archaeology).<br>  La Historia Antigua te proporciona los acotencimientos de los Pueblos de la Antiguedad, sistema de gobierno, estructura politica, forma de vida, etc., de Egipto, Persia, Babilonia, Fenicia, Nínive, etc., pueblos que son mencionados por la biblia entre otros.<br>  La ciencia hace par de a?os descubrio las propiedades del Aloe Vera, que era utilizado ya en tiempo Biblicos.<br>  En siglos pasado se descubrio que el conejo es un animal rumiante y en la Biblia es mencionada ya desde tiempos antiguos.<br>  Tanto en Salmos, Isaias, menciona que la tierra esta sostenida en el aire y que es redonda, nosotros tuvimos que esperar a Colon para que quedara firmemente establecido.<br>  En lo que se refiere a salud, Jehova Dios dio indicaciones a los Israelitas a enterrar sus excrementos dado que estos producían enfermedades de los cuales morían la mayorias de los pueblos de alrededor, muchos siglos despues se llego a esta conclusión.<br>  No se en que espacios de internet buscas, pero si tu interes verdadero es conocer la Verdad de las Escrituras, pide en oración al Creador y el te lo suminstrará en su moemnto debido.|`|BiczhbPwaa	?Tienes fe en la persona de Jesucristo?<br>  <br>  Si la tienes, serán santos y evangelios (evangelio significa "buena noticia").<br>  <br>  Si no la tienes, ?para qué preocuparte por ellos?|`|FiAdD5Z3aa	Primero, el Evangelio es uno solo: Dios nos dio su Primogenito para que por su muerte y resurreccion todos seamos salvos.<br>  Obviamente esta afirmacion solo la creen y la sostienen las personas que comulgan con esa fe.<br>  Un judio jamas te aceptaria la veracidad, y santidad de Cristo (que es el evangelio propiamente dicho).<br>  El echo que en la sagrada biblia figuren 4 evangelistas, no significa que sean 4 evangelios.

WKIILxNfaa	Richard Dawkins, in seinem Buch The God Delusion, nennt sich Atheist aber erkl?rt Atheismus etwa so:<br>  <br>  Man kann einfach nicht beweisen, dass es keinen Gott gibt, weil er au?erhalb unseres Universums existiere, falls er überhaupt existiert, und kann also nicht wissenschaftlich beobachtet werden. Deswegen kann sich niemand 100%ig Atheist nennen, ohne ignorant zu sein. Und es sind auch nur die wenigsten, die sagen würden, "Ich glaube absolut nicht an Gott und selbst, wenn mir eindeutige wissenschaftliche Beweise irgendwann in der Zukunft vorliegen, dass es einen Gott geben muss, glaube ich trotzdem nicht daran."<br>  <br>  Dawkins Art von Atheist sagt, "Ich sehe keine Beweise für einen Gott und deswegen halte ich es für h?chst unwahrscheinlich, dass es einen gibt und ich werde einfach so leben, als ob es keinen gibt. Ich kann es aber natürlich nicht 100%ig ausschlie?en, dass es einen geben k?nnte."<br>  <br>  Ein Agnostiker sagt, jedoch, "Ich bin ganz unsicher, was ich glauben soll. Vielleicht gibt's Gott und vielleicht auch nicht, aber mir ist es zu unangenehm, einen festen Standpunkt zu nehmen, weil man es einfach nicht wei?."<br>  <br>  Von dem her, finde ich, dass du eher Atheist bist.

Meine Vorstellung sieht ziemlich ?hnlich aus wie deine :-). Wie du das bezeichnen sollst... hmm... ich denke, ich würde am ehesten Agnostiker dazu sagen, eben weil du nichts ausschliesst. Aber wenn sich jemand wirklich dafür interessiert, was du glaubst, dann wird er sich sowieso nicht mit einem einzigen Wort zufrieden geben wollen, sondern nachfragen und das ist ja auch besser so. Gerade aus dem Grund den du selber nennst: diese Begriffe sind nicht immer ganz klar von einander zu trennen und nicht jeder versteht das gleiche darunter.|`|yIA8AbDcaa	Du hast nur deswegen Zweifel, weil du dir versuchst Gott vorzustellen und triffst immer wieder auf diese Zweifel. <br>  <br>  Gott kann man sich ja eben nicht vorstellen (da Gott nicht menschlich ist),  wenn ein Mensch sich Vorstellungen von Gott macht, bleibt es menschlich. Gott ist nicht menschlich!<br>  <br>  Lege deine Selbstvorstellungen von Gott ab und die Zweifel werden vergehen, denn die Liebe Gottes und seine Herrlichkeit, wird man nur über Jesus Christus erfahren, seit dem Christus auf Erden war!

Como una religión, el Islam lleva por completo la aceptación y el sometimiento a la ense?anza y consejo de Dios.<br>  No es una nueva religión, es en esencia el mensaje y consejo en el cual Dios reveló a todos sus mensajeros:<br>  Dijeron: "Nosotros creemos en Allah y ésto, lo cual fue revelado a Abraham, Ismael, Isaac y Jacob y a las tribus en las cuales fue dado a Moisés, a Jesús y a los profetas de su Se?or, nosotros no hacemos distinciones entre ellos y nos sometemos a éL".<br>  El mensaje que fue revelado al profeta Muhammad es el Islam en su forma final completa y comprensiva.<br>  Este mensaje nos da a entender que en el Islam Allah está por sobre todas las cosas, podemos compararlo con los conceptos del filósofo San Agustín, donde establece que Dios está por sobre todas las cosas y llegar a él es encontrar la sabiduría. <br>  En la historia de la filosofía árabe el médico era el sabio, el maestro por excelencia y el Filósofo, todo esto lo expresa el término Al-Hakim, con el cual se denominaba a los médicos.<br>  El aprendizaje de la medicina era para los musulmanes una búsqueda de la sabiduría que no se limitaba en el plano teórico, sino que necesitaba de la experiencia viajera, de buscar más allá de los conocimientos y conocer otros lugares y otras personas. La medicina era una forma de Filosofía que buscaba la salud de los hombres por medio de una vida adecuada a su naturaleza.<br>  En conclusión, ser médico para los musulmanes es ser sabio, o sea obtener la sabiduría y así llegar a Allah y convertirse en Filósofos; nos recuerda nuevamente a San Agustín que encontrando la sabiduría llega a Dios y es Filósofo.<br>  Los musulmanes consideran la ignorancia como el peor de los males, dice un proverbio árabe:<br>  " Buscad el saber aunque halla que ir hasta la China ".<br>  ? Cómo se produjo la expansión Islámica?<br>  Antes de hablar de la expansión islámica debemos saber lo que significa el vocablo expansión, que proviene del verbo expandir que significa propagar, ensanchar y extender.<br>  Como dijimos antes el Islam se propagó, esto ocurre por determinadas causas: la primera y más importante es el fervor religioso impreso por Mahoma a su pueblo, era propicio para inducirlo a llevar la fe a nuevas tierras.<br>  Otra causa es el espíritu belicoso que tenían las poblaciones del desierto islamizadas se vio frenado por la prohibición de las guerras entre las tribus.<br>  Además se vio favorecida por el extraordinario aumento de la población que hacía difícil la subsistencia, más cuando hubo grandes sequías y los sistemas de riego artificial eran insuficientes.<br>  Y por último los ricos estados de la vecindad inspiraban la codicia que siempre estimuló a los nómades a lanzarse sobre los sedentarios.<br>  Luego de que Mahoma fue rechazado y abandonado por los de su pueblo recibió apoyo de los de Medina, donde el medio es más propicio para admitir el monoteísmo central de la nueva predicación. Así se realiza un pacto entre el Profeta y los jefes de las tribus de Yatrib, llamado el pacto de Medina en el a?o 622.<br>  Mahoma se traslada a la Meca donde no es aceptado y vuelve a Medina.<br>  El pacto de Medina tiene gran importancia, los adictos deben aceptar la religión y así Mahoma se vuelve un soberano y se rompe la unidad tribal, se dividen en los que creen en Allhá y los que no, aunque sean de la misma tribu.<br>  En la Meca sucede que muchas familias humildes empiezan a adoptar el Islamismo por causas personales. Por otra parte Mahoma no podía quedarse en Medina y toma la Meca, a la cual convierte en capital de la nueva religión.<br>  Lugo de la muerte de Mahoma se realiza la verdadera expansión comenzando por la organización de la capital que se consolida y fortalece, se extiende desde los Pirineos hasta el Indo, quedando un imperio mayor que el de Roma. <br>  Hoy en día ésta comunidad está integrada aproximadamente por 800.000.000 de creyentes, se extiende desde Marruecos hasta Indonesia, ? partes viven en Asia y ? en áfrica, es la segunda religión de importancia en el mundo. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sarracenos<br>  El término sarraceno denominaba en su origen a los pueblos nómadas del desierto que ocupaban el área que se extiende desde la actual Siria hasta Arabia Saudí. En su uso más amplio, el término se aplicó a todos los árabes de la Edad Media. Estos nómadas del desierto surgieron repentinamente en el siglo VII y, en el plazo de un siglo y medio, crearon un imperio de grandes proporciones. Su elevada moral y su fe impulsaban su afán de conquista. Siguiendo las ense?anzas del profeta Mahoma, se propusieron cambiar el panorama religioso y político de todo el planeta. <br>  <br>  Hacia el 613, el profeta Mahoma predicaba una nueva religión que llamó Islam. Mayormente ignorado en su ciudad natal, La Meca, se marchó a Medina recabando un fuerte número de adeptos con lo que regresó para atacar y conquistar La Meca. Tras su muerte en el 632, sus ense?anzas fueron recopiladas en el Corán, el libro santo del Islam. Sus seguidores comenzaron una guerra santa (Jihad) en el 634. En cinco a?os habían invadido Egipto, Palestina y Siria. Su tolerancia frente a judíos y cristianos facilitó sus conquistas, ya que estos habían sido perseguidos por los bizantinos. <br>  <br>  Durante los 60 a?os posteriores, el norte de áfrica por el oeste y Persia por el este cayeron en poder del Islam. A principios del siglo VIII, los sarracenos de Tánger invadieron la Península Ibérica y conquistaron el reino visigodo establecido allí tras la caída de Roma. En oriente, los sarracenos arrebataron Asia Menor a los bizantinos e intentaron tomar Constantinopla con un ataque combinado desde tierra y mar. Pero las altas murallas de la ciudad frustraron el ataque por tierra y la flota sarracena también fue derrotada. En occidente, los francos dirigidos por Carlos Martel detuvieron en el 732 en Poitiers una invasión que tenía como objetivo la actual Francia. <br>  <br>  Frustradas en el oeste, las fuerzas del Islam se volvieron hacia el este. En el 750 habían conquistado hasta el río Indo, y por el norte atravesaron la India en dirección a Asia Central hasta los límites de China. <br>  <br>  En el 656, la guerra civil estalló en el mundo musulmán enfrentando a dos facciones: los sunitas y los chiítas. Sus divergencias incluían, entre otras, distintas interpretaciones del Corán y de quien debía ser proclamado califa. Como resultado de esta guerra de 60 a?os, el estado islámico se dividió en sectores, algunos gobernados por los sunitas (Península Ibérica) y otros por los chiítas (Egipto y el actual Irak). Los nuevos estados islámicos actuaron independientemente desde entonces. <br>  <br>  Durante los inicios de la Edad Media, la Espa?a musulmana se convirtió en uno de los grandes estados de Europa. Musulmanes, judíos y cristianos convivían con relativa armonía y una rica cultura surgió de esta múltiple influencia. Florecieron las artes, la arquitectura y el saber. Sin embargo, hacia el a?o 1000 la Espa?a musulmana se hallaba dividida en facciones guerreras. Esta guerra civil facilitó la lenta reconquista de la península (La Reconquista) por parte de los estados emergentes de Castilla y Aragón, completada finalmente en el a?o 1492 <br>  <br>  A principios del siglo XI, los musulmanes turcos conquistaron Asia Menor y el Oriente Medio. En respuesta a una llamada de auxilio de los bizantinos, se emprendieron una serie de Cruzadas desde Europa para recuperar Palestina del dominio turco. Los estados independientes musulmanes de la zona perdieron Palestina y la costa oriental mediterránea en la Primera Cruzada. A finales del siglo XII, el gran líder sarraceno Saladino consiguió con éxito unificar Egipto, Siria y varios estados menores, así como recuperar Jerusalén. <br>  <br>  Los estados musulmanes mantuvieron su independencia durante mucho tiempo después de acabar la Edad Media, y finalmente se consolidaron, convirtiéndose en las actuales naciones árabes de Oriente Medio y el Norte de áfrica. Sin embargo, declinaron económicamente cuando las naciones europeas, en los siglos XV y XVI, abrieron sus propias rutas comerciales en Asia. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mi trabajo de sociales sobre el ISLAM <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  MEJOR RTA|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Convenciendola con amor y hablandole de lo lindo que es tu religión.|`|gm1XXslEaa	tu no puedes hacer nada, es ella la que tiene que querer convertirse pues si lo hace solo para complacerte a ti no va a ser una autentica musulmana, sino lo que tu quieres.

Si amas a alguien y estás con ella, entonces vivirán experiencias amorosas juntos. Ahora si estás solo y no tienes a nadie, el cuerpo igual te pedirá cierto roce para descargar tu emotividad. En este caso, el sexo casual, con descarga emotiva pero sin carga sentimental se impone. Habrá emociones, ya que el orgasmo es una de ellas. (Espero que sepas encontrar el de tu compa?era). Si en tus encuentros casuales tienes buenas experiencias, podrás acumular experiencia para volcar cuando tengas una pareja a la que ames. Ahora si amas realmente a alguien, no tendrá mucho sentido el sexo casual porque te dejará un sabor muy amargo en la boca. Eso siempre y cuando hayas logrado una plena empatía sexual y sensual con tu pareja.<br>  Por último: Es cierto, el sexo existe sin amor, pero también es cierto que el amor no existe sin sexo.

Por ejemplo, el purgatorio, es una pena temporal. Pero el castigo eterno, no se hace, a las personas que estan arrepentidas. Solamente los que rechazan a Dios, se van al infierno. Quien quiera salvarse se salvará. Quien rechace el amor de Dios, se condenará. Dios no es injusto. Las personas que estan en el infierno, están ahí porque rechazaron la misericordia de Dios. Rechazaron el amor de Dios. Rechazaron a Dios hasta el último momento. Y Dios que los sigue amando, los deja ir, a donde ellos quieran ir. No creas que esos condenados, gritaban, Dios mio salvame, y Dios los echó contra su voluntad. Dios los quería en el Cielo, pero ellos prefieren la obscuridad. Y Dios respeta su libertad. Por otro lado los condenados, no quieren salir del infierno. Odian a Dios, se odian a si mismos, odian a los demonios y a los demás condenados. Odian a los ángeles del cielo. Odian a los hombres de la tierra. Sufren pero no se arrepienten.|`|7baqgMJqaa	Tu preguntas: ?Realmente existe un pecado tan infinito?<br>  <br>  Biblicamente si, existe un pecado que no podrá ser perdonado y es la blasfemia en contra del Espiritu Santo de Dios. Dios perdona todos los pecados, los mas horrendos y los mas espantosos siempre y cuando esa persona se arrepienta de corazón.<br>  <br>  Tu dices:<br>  <br>  ?Es justo entonces que paguemos eternamente por pecar un tiempo corto en comparacion a la eternidad?<br>  <br>  Te quiero preguntar si acaso es justo que haya violadores, asesinos, ladrones, estafadores, pedófilos y sobre todos violadores de bebés y gente que de verdad es mala. Si esas personas no se arrepienten ?crees tu que Dios sería injusto si los castigara? Pero antes de que Dios los castigue, le da una y mil oportunidades a los seres humanos para arrepentirse y si no se arrepienten sellan su suerte. Serán castigados y condenados.<br>  <br>  Tu preguntas y te respondes en lo siguiente que escribes:<br>  <br>  No sera mas bien una estrategia creada para hacernos sentir temor, puesto que si las condenas fueran justas a razon del tiempo que vivimos, entonces la paga del pecado no seria eterna, sino mas bien una condena en a?os o un tiempo medible y si fuera asi, no todos temerian al castigo pues no seria una pena eterna.<br>  <br>  Lamentablemente Dios no tiene necesidad de estrategias. Dios es justo. Al que hace lo malo se le pagará de acuerdo a lo malo que ha hecho en vida, aunque si se arrepiente de corazón de todas sus maldades, y acepta a Jesucristo como Su Salvador personal Dios no se acordará de sus pecados. <br>  <br>  Se menciona una muerte segunda de la cual se habla en la Biblia. Algunos serán resucitados para condenación y los que han creído en Jesucristo van a vivir eternamente con Dios. <br>  <br>  Hay muchos que se mofan de estas cosas y no creen. Pero te pregunto a ti ?Sabes cual es tu destino? No crees tu que es mejor estar seguro a donde nos vamos y no llevarnos una sorpresa despues, cuando ya nada se pueda remediar?<br>  <br>  Cuando yo veo las noticias y veo las barbaridades que se cometen en el mundo, siempre agradezco a Dios por Su justicia.

Es acaso congruente que los cielos se sitúen en la misma ubicación que tienen los infiernos?<br>  R.- Estimable caballero, es urgente comprender en forma integral que todo en la naturaleza y en el cosmos se resume en sumas y restas de dimensiones que se penetran y<br>  compenetran mutuamente sin confundirse. Existe un postulado hermético que dice: ?Tal como es arriba, es abajo?. Aplique usted este postulado al tema en cuestión.<br>  Es ostensible que los nueve cielos, tienen dentro del interior de nuestro organismo planetario, sus correlaciones de acuerdo con la ley de las correspondencias y analogías.<br>  Estos nueve cielos dentro del interior de nuestro organismo planetario en que vivimos, se correlacionan inteligentemente con las nueve zonas profundas del planeta tierra.<br>  Empero todavía no he explicado a fondo la cuestión, lo que sucede realmente es que  estos nueve cielos tienen un centro de gravitación atómico ubicado exactamente en el centro del planeta tierra. En otra forma, quiero decirle y decirles a todos ustedes se?ores y se?oras, que los nueve cielos gravitan en el átomo central del planeta tierra, extendiéndose mucho más allá de todo el sistema solar.<br>  Este mismo proceso se repite con cada uno de los planetas del sistema solar de Ors (  Mercurio, Venus, Tierra, Martes, Jupiter, Urano Neptuno y Pluton ).<br>  puedes visitar este Web <a href="http://samaelgnosis.net" rel="nofollow">http://samaelgnosis.net</a>

A los catorce a?os de edad se casó con el cubano Antonio Sanjenís, con quien se fue a radicar a La Habana. En 1918, cuando Rosario Sansores tenía 29 a?os, falleció su esposo. Volvió a México, y específicamente a la capital, en donde fue columnista de la sección de sociales en los periódicos Hoy y Novedades. Público obras de poesía como Mientras se va la vida (1925) y Rutas de emoción (1954). Sansores se declaraba contraria a las tendencias modernas de la poesía (de mediados del siglo XX), y se declaraba cursi:<br>  <br>  Sí, sí, la gente dice que soy cursi. Imagínate si no voy a saberlo. Pero no me preocupa. Al contrario, me halaga. La gente que sabe que soy cursi demuestra que me ha leído, y eso el lo único que importa[1].<br>  <br>  A pesar de que sus poemas sirvieron de base para la creación de numerosas canciones en América del Sur —especialmente en Ecuador y Colombia—, Rosario Sansores visitó en muy pocas ocasiones aquellas tierras. De hecho, en Ecuador sólo estuvo una vez, en 1967, cuando el ayuntamiento de Guayaquil le concedió un premio literario.<br>  <br>  <br>   Cuando tú te hayas ido <br>  Y en la penumbra vaga de la peque?a alcoba<br>  donde una tibia tarde me acariciaras toda,<br>  te buscarán mis brazos, te buscará mi boca,<br>  y aspiraré en el aire como un olor a rosas<br>  Cuando tu te hayas ido me envolverán las sombras.|`|c3823aa0f3c18e947c06573468917d4baa	ELBA ESTHER GORDILLO MORALES <br>  Elba Esther Gordillo Morales nació en Comitán, Chiapas, en 1945.

Estas madurando, tienes confianza en ti misma, tus amigos te apoyan en todo. <br>  Te surgirá una promoción inesperada en el trabajo, o en algún puesto, no tiene por que ser trabajo, simplemente que subirás de categoría social. Es posible que cambies de trabajo, o de sitio en donde resides ahora, al hacer ese cambio conocerás a una persona (si es que ya no la conoces), se trata de un chico de entre 19 y 30 a?os, moreno o pelirrojo. Ese chico te traerá estabilidad en la vida, tanto económica como emocional. <br>  La luna invertida aparece como el obstaculo a tus planes, y representa alguna dependencia que tengas, o hasta un embarazo no deseado. <br>  Pero como resultado final, te sale una buena carta, representa el inicio de algo, de una relacion nueva, un negocio, etc.|`|R4OjNAtIaa	acercandote a Dios y alejandote de esas tonterias.

NO se celebra a ningún satanás, NO es un día de brujas, eso es algo que religiones tradicionales inventaron simplemente y los ingenuos se lo creen.<br>  La festividad original data de hace miles de a?os, cuando se celebraba entre finales de octubre y primera semana de noviembre, la época en que el velo entre el mundo de los vivos y el de los muertos es más frágil, por lo cual, los espíritus pueden pasar a este mundo para "compartir" con los vivos.<br>  Religiones Paganas también celebramos la fecha en que el Dios pasa a la Tierra del Eterno Verano, para volver a renacer alrededor del 21 de diciembre.<br>  Dado que se celebra a los difuntos, el día de todos los muertos se fué degradando a una festividad vulgar llamada también "noche de brujas". Si bien es cierto, las brujas celebramos la noche del 31 de octubre, no lo hacemos como lo hacen las personas que salen a divertirse y pedir dulces, sino que celebramos el recuerdo de nuestros antepasados, rindiendo honor a Los Antiguos y a Los Dioses.<br>  Por lo tanto, el "día de Halloween" es malo para quienes NO comprenden nunca su verdadero significado-. Sin embargo, para aquellos que conocemos y respetamos su vedadero significado, es un día de respeto y celebración.|`|GmZoZda5aa	Bueno los ni?os lo disfrutan mucho y eso como los divierte esta bien por ese lado ...<br>  Pero si vamos a profundizar en lo que significa realmente ya no debería celebrarse tal día!!|`|QwCBahvvaa	a mi me gusta ^^|`|Z2y6Ch0Raa	Creo que en sí el "Halloween" tal y como debe ser no es malo, es sólo una fiesta donde las personas se disfrazan.

Por ejemplo, en México se celebra el Día de Muertos con las tradiciones prehispánicas pero el Halloween ha llegado a tener un mayor posicionamiento entre los jóvenes y poniendo en riesgo la pérdida de esta costumbre prehispánica.|`|0CkUWXNoaa	Es una festividad cuyos origenes vienen de las tradiciones celtas, la cual fue satanisada con el surgimiento de las religiones judeo cristianas.....para mas detalle ve la respuesta de Astarté^_^|`|8QMeJOo0aa	creo que el día de haloween data de muchos siglos atrás, perteneciente a la cultura celta , ese día que era la noche y víspera del día de todos los santos 1o de noviembre , las personas que se creían brujos del mal sacrificaban ni?os , empalaban personas y muchas otras cosas mas, te lo digo porque escuche una conversaciòn una vez de un nazi precursor  de la cultura celta y quede estupecta , despues supe por las noticias que estos dias se pierden muchos ni?os y se hacen barbaridades,tambien supe por otra fuente que ese dia de los santos quedaba abierto un portal para que todas las entidades negativas , elementales salieran ha hacer de las suyas.
