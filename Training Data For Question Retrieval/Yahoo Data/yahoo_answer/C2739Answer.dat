If I were you I'd make a call to your vet or to a dog kennel and see what they say.    You can never be too careful... Good Luck!!|`|ecYNiE0maa	Have you checked inside her mouth and look at her teeth|`|hdYgdu0oaa	my dog is 14 and she still whines.....all the time!|`|CD5C2nhFaa	There may be something wrong internally. I mean, I'm not a vet, but it sounds to me like she may be in pain. I would take her to her vet ASAP.
tPGxPDvBaa	Most likely it is a hereditary condition from the greyhound side.  The  giant & larger breeds tend to have heart problems esp. enlarged.  You need to speak with your vet more & see what they have to say.  It is best if you write your questions as you think of them then take the list with you when you go back.  That way you will remember all the questions & can write the answers if you need to.  Sorry for you & him.  I am not sure about how good his chances are & don't believe there is  much they can do that his age other than treat as best as you can.  Honestly you need to prepare for the worst & if he gets better, it will be more of a relief.  But don't let him suffer cuz you can't or don't want to say goodbye - it is not fair to him.|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	OH OH I agree with joanplus that is likely inherited from the greyhound side - BUT its NORMAL for a Greyhound to have a large heart for body size NOT diseased. More then one vet has been fooled by this  see these greyhound sites  www.gcnm.org/heartnews.html  animalmedicalcentreofmedina.com/librar...     so the $64 question is does he have an enlarged heart for a partblood greyhound (and he may well be more than half greyhound as many lurchers have  grey blood) OR does he have another problem and a normal for greyhound heart?|`|ge31jjbnaa	I think your best interest would be to think about how your dog is feeling especially if he is not responding to the treatment.  Is it fair to keep him around because you can't think of being without him?  Or is it more humane to put him down to end his suffering?  Those are some questions you need to ask yourself and your vet.    I too have a dog and couldn't imagine having to put him down but sometimes it's the best thing to do.  I am not a vet or anything of the sort but I am just speaking from what I would do faced with these circumstances.  It sound like he is pretty old and I am not sure of the life expentancy of your pet but I am sure he has a great life.  Also, please don't take this the wrong way, I am just giving you my thoughts from a nuetral party and an lover/owner of dogs.  Good luck and I hope every thing works out.

You need to take her places and socialize her with you there.  You're the person she knows and (hopefully) trusts.  If you send her out among strangers, she's going to be over threshold and she'll be paniced and she'll get never get better.    You've got to take her out for walks and work on counter-conditioning her.  That is, start feeding her treats when people approach before she reacts badly.  Keep feeding treats until the person's passed.  She'll start associating people with good things.  This is a long, involved process.    If she's afraid of traffic, you start walking her in low-traffic areas and gradually increase the amount of traffic.    You could also take her to obedience classes but first make sure the instructor is experienced with shy dogs.  The socializing will be good for her and success at obedience should instill confidence.|`|dRUgXlOLaa	You can try to socialize her with other dogs.  Try to find her a play mate or set up a play date so that she can become comfortable.  i will attach a site below that allows you to find these things for your puppy.|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	Something like that might work but you might start with going to a dog park or something. Also talk to your vet.   If it's the sound of the barking that makes her nervous, try putting on a movie with lots of dogs barking so she gets used to the sound. I've heard this works with dogs who are afraid of thunder so I don't see why it wouldn't work with barking.  Good luck with your new pup!|`|PklUNqOWaa	You could try enrolling her in training classes like at petsmart and that would help her become socialized. there would be plenty of puppies and people there. Even to take  her there on the weekend where there are people out and about.|`|sFXv9TIyaa	Doggie daycare sounds great but i would send her at least once a week. She needs to socialize with other dogs,people etc and get use to different noises.Constantly reassure her that shes a good dog when shes looking timid/shy and she should come round :)|`|lFrJ6hqNaa	we have a rescue dog he was 1 when we got him he is know 7 he was the same we took him out twice a day for walks to the same place and he slowly gained confidence but he still does not like dogs jumping up at him he likes his own space

ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	It is just a burst of maleness.  Even females do it now and again.|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	to show dominance|`|XK9RLaPeaa	They are having trouble figuring out who is dominate. They arent doing it because they are "interested" in the other or because they are excited. Its just when they are playing, their adrenaline gets up and the other will decide to declare dominance. They might settle it, and then the other one will decide to claim dominance over the other one, so it will go on and on, until they decide.|`|MGAmNxddaa	Dogs do this as a form of dominance......they want to be the leader of the pack.Some dogs will submit to it and allow it,while others may turn and snap at the dog trying to show who the boss is.In any case,no matter what you do,THEY will decide  who is the boss amongst themselves..you can't stop it.You can scold them whenever you see it happening,but you aren't there 24/7 watching them.As long as no one is being hurt,let them decide.It is nothing of a sexual nature...it's just the order of life.Males and females alike will take part in this ritual as they feel the need to show who is the boss.|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	I have female dogs. And when we go somewhere in the car, the Alpha female always humps the other out of excitement. We are always saying, "No humpies!" ha. But more embarrassing, we were at a stop light in heavy traffic, when we noticed people in the other cars pointing and laughing...You guessed it! ha. "No humpies!'.|`|FiPuVuS7aa	i think its showing who is boss    or he is sexualy confused lol|`|z0X4EhfRaa	dominate....that is how dogs will dominate another dog...even females will do it|`|bEw2yWqaaa	My uncle's female dog humps their male. Its just a form of excitement....or possibly dominating the other dog.|`|xPxm8ONiaa	He is trying to dominate your other dog. Don't let him do that, he is trying to become the pack leader. When you see your dog do this, even if it isn't a lot, correct him. Firmly tap the side of your dogs neck, with your fingers, as if the were teeth. Your dog will learn that YOU are the pack leader, NOT him. Good luck and have fun :)|`|WnpaPlz2aa	this is a sign of trying to show dominance. its normal. no big deal.
kaqDUsI7aa	Really, it doesn't matter which one you buy. They all do the same job. I own tons of bridles, some have brow bands, some are single eared, and I think I have one or two double eared bridles lying around. Its all a matter of opinion. Personally, my favorite is the one ear. I think they make a horse look a little classier, and they don't block any markings on their face or make their forelock look 'fluffy'. On the other hand, my best friend wont ride in anything that doesn't have a brow band because she thinks that one ear bridles look goofy. Really, its all your choice. Choosing a bridle is like picking out a pair of shoes--it all depends on what style you like.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I use a one-ear headstall every day. It has no throat latch, and I've only had a problem with it once. We went under a low branch and it pulled her ear out. The top of the headstall went behind her ears, though, not in front. So I just reached down and pulled it forward. I think it depends on how well-made the bridle is.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	I like the double holes.|`|uEQ2LbQyaa	i dont think it really matters|`|mKWwz1uUaa	What ever one you like it good, I like the Brow band and single ear myself for what ever reason I find the double ear silly:P   Are you looking for show?    I've been using a single ear for 22 yrs with no problems, (knock on wood, lol)  I've used this on dozens of different horses and no throat latch.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Whatever your choice is.  I like the one ears for riding around. Sometimes I use it when I show, sometimes I use a browband. They do make one ears with and without a throatlatch. Its all a personal preference.  I have seen horses rub off full headstalls with browband and throatlatch and noseband.  If they want it off, its coming off.|`|5TCewPYRaa	It really doesnt matter....as long as it looks nice, the leather is good quality and it fits good.    I personally like the look of a double ear better as it is more balanced on the head...if you are planning to show western pleasure look for something with a little bit of silver on the ears---it really frames the horses face nicely and draws attention to the head, then the body and so on...  However Single ears a much easier to find!  Make sure you dont get a shaped ear or a slide ear headstall---if your horses head is different than where the ear is placed on these headstalls, it will rub and not look right...get one that moves freely :)       Try http://www.westernshop.com for some awesome heastalls--they are great quality at reasonable prices!     Here are a few I found on there,     1. Single Ear---GORGEOUS! (and actually fairly inexpensive...like $60!)  http://www.westernshop.com/cgi-bin/produ...    2.This bridle is absolutely amazing! I am currently saving up to purchase it...Can't wait to put it on my little guy this summer!     http://www.westernshop.com/cgi-bin/produ...|`|XsBIITFvaa	Single ear bridles are what's "supposedly" in in the show ring right now, but I find them tacky and dangerous if not properly worn right. The first time I rode with a single ear piece bridle, it didn't have a throat latch (go figure) and the green horse I was riding started bucking, and the whole bridle slipped off of her head. Even though that was my fault for riding without a throat latch, I refuse to ride in a single ear piece bridle.    oh and double holes, to me, are very very unattractive. I'd stick with the brow band.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	I prefer western bridles with a browband and no ear loop.  It's just my preference, I don't show in classes where it mattered on the hole(s).  I took the throat latch part of my bridle because my horse seems to not like them.  He first bridle didn't have one either so it's just him lol.|`|ipdYlQFOaa	i have one with just one ear, and i like it just the same as my other one with two ears. but i think if your looking for more of a classy look, the one ear would be a good choice|`|eiVWEW3aaa	dont think that it really matters, i have both, and their pretty much the same thing, one is just more stylish.|`|hMXHsAbHaa	I have used them all and personally i just like the browband type. I find them to be more flattering on my horses heads, but they are arabs and are everything fits on them funny anyways lol. It doesn't really matter, everyone has their own preference and it is what ever you think is right for your horses. :)|`|yltEk7ayaa	I ride in both. So it is all about what you like. I have never used a 2 hole, but if I find a bridle I like and it has 2 I just slide on ear piece off.    Enjoy and happy showing!|`|u4F1OiE4aa	I personally like either the one eared or the two eared because they are both in the style for western pleasure. Keep in mind it will cost more for the two eared with silver because you are paying for extra silver. I haven't seen many people using browbands recently, although they are just fine for working your horse in. If you get a fancy headstall, you will want to buy a cheaper one for working your horse in because you will want it to stay in good condition. Good luck!|`|ZBeVXNtHaa	I don't like the way the one holed bridles look.  go with double hole. :)

JfBzzXQ4aa	I'm glad your dog has a vet appointment. This could be a breast tumor. But it may not be cancerous, so don't panic yet.|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	It may be from old age|`|5765d15bf5b7da6026f760e75cea316faa	It could be a mammary tumor or cyst.  It could also be an infection.  Best wishes, hope she is better soon.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Sounds like it could be a growth, maybe harmful, maybe not. Dogs can get cancer too.   My dog got a tumor in his abdomen that grew in a week's time from about walnut sized to grapefruit size. Sorry to say that was it for him, and it did come on suddenly, but he was mature in years. Then there are dogs who have benign growths also. The vet will let you know. I hope it turns out to be not a big deal.
JfBzzXQ4aa	What does your vet say about his weight at his yearly check-ups? It would probably be best to discuss this with him. We have no idea what size your dog is to know what weight he should be. Not even a picture to look at to take a guess. Your vet can actually see your dog & put hands on him to assess his weight. Both Goldens & Labradors tend to get heavy if their owners don't watch the amount they eat & give them plenty of exercise. A dog should have a definite "waist" when looked down on from above. He should have a tuckup at his abdomen area. You should be able to easily feel ribs when you put your hands down from the top over his rib cage. You should be able to feel his spine when you run your hands down his back & be able to feel his hip bones. These are some of the clues I use to monitor my dog's weight. You can also take your dog into the vets office & weigh him periodically to track his weight (this doesn't cost anything). Less food & more exercise are the only ways to shed extra pounds.|`|MURxMnLtaa	sound like you need a high quality low fat dog food to help with the exercising.  I feed Canine Caviar dog food, it's holistic and my dogs do great on it.  They have a special needs formula with low fat for overweight dogs.  http://caninecaviar.com/special%20needs....|`|s9haCi64aa	Depends on his breeding, is he a show bred lab (short and tubby) or field bred (tall and lanky). My lab is nearly 2yrs old and weighs 74lbs which is spot on for him but Ive heard that show bred labs could be anything upto 80lbs, Ive heard of them being 100lbs but thats classed as overweight|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Labradors can easily get overweight. It also depends on his build, if he is large and strong or a bit smaller, so it is difficult to say and ideal weight. What is more important than weight is that when you move your hand lightly over his sides you should be able to just feel his ribs, without pressing hard. If you can feel his ribs, he is at his ideal weight, if you cannot he is overweight, and if his ribs stand out so you can see them from a distance, he is underweight. If he is overweight, don't give him any treats in between meals, cut back a little bit on his meals and give even more exercise.|`|MGAmNxddaa	You should be able to hold your thumbs together,and run your fingers across both of his sides with your remaining fingers...you should be able to just barely feel his ribs.If you can't he is a bit overweight then,and you need to decrease his food intake by 1/2 a cup or so ..until you reach his goal weight.Talk to your vet about this first though|`|AA11020247	not sure about the weight but if you look down on him he should have an hour glass shape body.|`|TYjXGyCzaa	Maybe increase the walks from half an hour to an hour.  Also if you really are concerned for his weight but the dog food that helps for weight issues.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Start jogging on walks and increase the amount of time you walk or do it more frequently. Inside, if you have a treadmill, that could work too. Take him in the yard and exercise him too.|`|wLZsPYh9aa	why care if hes a good boy and loves you then just be ok|`|t36Dce0Laa	Put him on a diet|`|3qckOFWIaa	if your pet is overweight it is taking in (eating) more calories than it needs. Set all excuses aside ... excessive weight in an otherwise healthy  pet is a direct result of consuming unnecessary amounts of food. If your pet is overweight it should be examined for heart, thyroid or other metabolic disorders. Dog needs a meat-based diet, high in protein (which isn't stored as fat) and fat and low in carbohydrate.|`|T8OFsBUUaa	This is a hard questions because dogs vary so much in size. If your dog is average size for a lab, should be 65 - 80 lbs. But if he is tall, he'll way more. best to take him to the vet and ask their opinion. Retrievers of any kind have a tendency to be over weight, so he may very well be. My friend has a lab that is 130, but considered about right because he is so tall. Best consult your vet. Make sure you are not over-feeding, and that you're feeding high quality food. Cheaper foods with more fillers can cause dogs to be obese too.

I8Tahe4Jaa	I think you should follow what justacowgirl suggested. I suspect that you probably won't get very far trying to get her to go into a nice headset with that much muscle in the wrong places. When you get back to riding her- after you've done lots of ground work and gotten her to respond well/ yield to pressure in a halter, try a bosal or hackmore, to see if her being unfamiliar with a bit and it's different pressure is contributing to the head tossing. You can work her on the ground in a bit, too, if you suspect that its the problem- this will also get her used to the pressure of your bit without having the added complications of you riding. What bit do you use? If you feel she has fair brakes, I'd put her in a nice, fat loose ring snaffle or a french link (if she is used to being ridden in a broken mouth bit).    I would do lots of bending with her and get her to work long and low before you try to set her head. Start off with her standing, and ask her to bend her neck in both directions. She might walk in a small circle while her neck muscles are still in the wrong places/ tight. That's ok for the beginning, but remember the thrust is to get her to stand still and bend.    When she bends through her whole neck- releasing and giving to pressure from the withers to the poll- while standing, you can start asking for bends at the walk. Do circles at a walk with her bending to the inside then to the outside, alternately for a few strides each way before switching. Release the pressure when she gives at her poll.    Next, when she is bending well at the walk, go ahead on to the trot. Work the circle again, as I said above until she has that down. Then try serpentines and figure eights with a nice inside bend. I would focus on walk trot for now and work up to cantering when she is more balanced and has good muscle development.    All this bending will get her to lower her head, and relax it, too. Don't worry too much about where her head is while you're doing all this, she will lower it on her own, in her own time, and she wont have the added confusion of you constantly twiddling and massaging the rein to get her to drop and round down.    Once you notice that she is going at the walk and trot with her head low, and relaxed, you can start setting her head. Keep an elastic amount of contact- with give in your elbows, wrists and shoulders- keep a nice bend in your elbow and ride her into the bridle. When she breaks at the poll, release the pressure. Repeat when her head comes out of position. As long as her head is low and on the bit, leave it be. I would work at the walk first, then trot, then focus on maintaining the headset through transitions.     In a few months, when the lower neck muscle has gone, she has a nice topline, is off her forehand and is driving from behind you can start work of the canter. Do the same things I suggested for trot, and work on achieving a collected, forward, balanced canter and that nice headset you want.      Good luck with her. You'll need lots of patience and consistency! It's well worth it, though, to have a polished mount.    EDIT- D-ring snaffle is also a nice choice. You seem like you know what you're doing. I'd keep it up. Best of luck to you, again, and keep us posted. We LOVE success stories and I can just tell that's what this will be.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Have you tried a hackamore or side pull or even just a halter? Something without a bit, and start from the beginning.. with whoa.Then just walk her awhile, every time you get on. She needs to know that running and getting spurred isn't her life.  I had a horse once from a yee-haw Girl!!  Grrrr. All the horse knew was to run. Took about a month of just walking and showing him he did not have to run. When he finally relaxed and started giving in, we went to a regular cub bit (they dint have all them fancy bits like now). We basically started like it was the first time he had been rode. By the end of the 2nd month, he was a dream to ride. Unfortunately after 6 months, they wanted him back :-( He ended up dying from neglect)!!  *~*~* I wish you the best...I think we would all like to know how it turns out. :-)|`|VmZKZjP1aa	Start with a softer bit. Ours did the same. We switched him to a snaffle bit. He really responded to that. It will take time for her to get used to the bit. If that bit doesn't work, try a different type of soft bit until you find one that works for her. She probably needed the tie down because of the head jerking. If you can't find a bit that works, stick with the tie down.    You can also try putting a bit on a bridle and taking off the reins and let her wear it for an hour or so, so she can get used to it. You'll want to watch her though so she doesn't get it caught on anything.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	It seems as if you have a wonderful opportunity on you hands (no pun intended).    This horse is green as grass and you will have to start from square one without the challenges of being able to get on etc.    You may want to start doing a lot of work at a walk, doing circles and serpentines.  When he tries to get ahead of the bit,do half halts and bring him back.  If he is ahead of the bit and attempting to get faster, get him to engage his hind end as he may be heavy on the forehand.    Do alot of bending. counter walk or walk in a circle to the right with his head to the left. Use your leg to push his body over but use your hands to move his head to the other side.     This isn't going to be a quick fix.  Some of this may work and then you may have to try additional tricks.|`|eiVWEW3aaa	get a trainer, it helped with my horse|`|y7H1V39Jaa	You have all the right information and skills, just stick with it...seriously.  I can tell by how you describe the mare and the issues at hand that you know what you are doing, and in my opinion, you are doing great.  I don't say this often, but I mean it, sincerely.  So, keep on keeping on.  EDIT********By the way, you are using the bit I would be using.    EDIT  2******One more thing, subtle, responsive and forgiving hands are the key...now, when she gives, you subtly give back equally, but only if she gives in the direction that you want her to...if she gives, but does so upward to evade the bit and your hands, don't jerk, but don't give an inch until she decides to come back and do it the right way.  I don't mean to pull her back to a point behind where she began, just HOLD STEADY until she returns to the starting point and then goes where you ask her to go.  Sounds like you have what it takes, along with the patience to accomplish it. *
6jkusbCgaa	I have pugs too and it is very simple. Simply let them hang out together and play from the first minute. If your older Pug is a little off, simply hold him and tell him/her that they are a good boy and pet them, etc. Usually the older dog typically tends to "mother" the younger one and you'll notice they'll stick up for the other in relative situations.     The dogs will let each other know who is most dominant.|`|MURxMnLtaa	Give the new guy lots of love and be patient with him until he knows the routine around there....and make sure to give extra loves to the one you already have so he knows you aren't replacing him with another dog.

Pm8nsCGZaa	According to the AQHA, a dun has a line down it's back. HOWEVER, I have a buckskin with a 2" wide line that fades in summer, but is still visible, and AQHA says its a buckskin. I had a AQHA "dun" mare, that the IBHA (Int'l Buckskin Horse Assoc) registered her as a buckskin.  To me, a dun does not have the dark legs, mane and tail like your typical buckskin does. They can both have the zebra markings. It all comes down to the genetics.  http://www.grullablue.com/colors/dun_fac...  *!*!* AQHA says: duns will always have the zebra/tiger striping. IBHA does not.  lol so pick your color  :-)|`|AA12023527	duns have a line down the middle of thier backs.|`|fYURvmlhaa	it depends on what buck skin it is it could be a light or dark or creamy and dun is a brown orange i think by the way this is kendall.see ya in school pony grl.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	I agree with justacow.  My friends horse is a buckskin, however she has a dorsal stripe that comes and goes with the seasons.  She has a jet black mane and has black legs.  Many people call her dun because of the dorsal stripe but she doesn't have the zebra stripes.  I call a buckskin, but it for us it doesn't really matter, we love her!     My rule of thumb:  Dun=Primitive markings, zebra stripes, sometimes doesn't have black legs.  Buckskin=Black legs, black mane, can have dorsal stripe, no zebra stripes.|`|K8FhZf8maa	duns have a line down their back.|`|3qckOFWIaa	Dun and buckskin are color patterns that result from entirely different genetic agents, and they are actually easy to tell apart if you can get up close to the horse.|`|fhf9Pnp1aa	buckskins each seperate hair is almost a chesnut color ant the skin but as it gets further,its gets lighter,usually buckskins have a dorsal stripe down theri back.odvesly black mane and talk|`|z3Z7AQWPaa	There are several differences genetically, and I'm sure someone will explain that. But visually dun's have an eel stripe (aka: dorsal stripe).  Buckskins don't.|`|XsBIITFvaa	Buckskin and Dun are caused be two separate genes. Buckskin is a creme gene (which also makes cremellos, perlinos, palominos, and smoky blacks) on a bay base. Dun is given by the dun gene.    Dun horses have dorsal stripes and typically have horizontal stripes up their legs. They may also have striping on their shoulders. Dun can be on basically any color horse. A horse called a bay dun, red dun, dunalino, grulla, or grullo is a dun, with the name depending on what base coat the gene is on.|`|HY2i80mjaa	OK so buckskin is a colour...a set colour with variations on light and darkness of the body, but must always have a predominatly black mane and tail and black points...    Dun on the other hand, is a particular genetic makeup, that can occur in a range of colours but always has set markings that go with it. EG stripes on legs visible or almost completely unnoticeable, a dorsal stripe, a dun with a strong genetic background will have a much darker dorsal stripe, the dorsal stripe will always be the same predominant colour as the mane and tail and should flow from wither to dock as if joining both.  Duns can occur from grey dun to black dun and all colours in between...Duns have a genetic background of prehistoric horses, hence the dorsal stripe and stripes, they must also have a darker shade mane and tail....|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Any horse with these primitive markings is a dun:        Dorsal Stripe - The color of the stripe will depend on the body color - can vary from black or dark brown to a sorrel or peach color.    Leg Barring - These are horizontal stripes across the hocks, inside and on the front of hind legs, and on the back of the forearms and across the knees.    Shoulder Stripe or Shadowing - A stripe, or sometimes, several stripes, over the withers in varying widths and lengths. Occasionally several stripes will merge together giving a shadow effect.    Ear Tips - The tops and sometimes the sides of the ears are darker than the body color. Occasionally there are also horizontal stripes on the backside of the ears.    Neck Shadowing - Occasionally dark shadows will appear on the crest of the neck or extending into the hollow of the shoulder.    Cobwebbing - Lines of varying lengths over the forehead and face resembling a spider web. Occasionally the lines extend from the eye somewhat like an eyebrow. Sometimes the lines merge to look like shadows across the bridge of the nose or around the lips and nostrils.    Mane and Tail Frosting - Light hairs in the mane or at the top of the tail. The light hairs can run throughout the length of tail.    Mottling - Similar to dapples, however the mottling color is darker than the body color (as opposed to the lighter dappling). Additionally the mottling is usually only found on the forearms, shoulders, gaskins, and stifles, whereas dappling is usually on the barrel and hips.        If they don't have any of those, they're a buckskin.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Dun has a dorsal strip
hC4Z8HIbaa	What would you be comparing fancy rats to when you want to compare their size? I would say that domesticated rats tend to be about the same size as wild rats. Of course, there is a natural variation in size in both animals, so one rat may be larger or smaller than another.<br>  <br>  There is absolutely no research to suggest that white rats are smarter or bite more often than any other fur color. There is no difference between a white rat and a black rat other than the gene that determines color. The only thing I could think of that would make your friend think they are smarter is their wide use in scientific settings. However, this does not mean they are smarter. There are reasons why scientists typically only use all white rats, but it is too complicated to explain here. There is also nothing to say that a white rat would be more aggressive than another color rat. Aggression usually stems from a number of things. One would be genetics and physical issues such as hormone levels. Another would be their level of handling. Rats who are handled and socialized are less likely to be afraid of humans and will bite less or even not at all. Rats that are not socialized will see the human hand as an enemy and will attack it. This is one of the reasons I do not suggest purchasing a rat from a pet store. Most pet stores do not take the time to properly socialize their rats, making them more aggressive. Adopting a rat from a rescue would likely ensure a more handled, socialized rat that would be suitable for a beginner rat owner. Another reason not to purchase from a pet store is the high liklihood of disease. Pet stores keep their rats in tanks that do not allow proper ventilation, causing the smell to build up. The smell will give them respiratory issues. Pet store rats also tend to have bad genetic makeup, resulting in diseases such as tumors and early death.<br>  <br>  If you are considering adopting some rats (as they should always be kept in at least same sex pairs), I suggest doing some browsing on the website below. It is a rat community that I am a member of. It has tons of great information for any current and potential rat owner. Hope to see you there!|`|nwH5ax40aa	it you treat them right they won't bite, rats only bite if they feel threatened or hurt, that goes the same for all animals.<br>  Fancy rats are smaller than dumbos. males bigger than females.|`|xQtnTKCAaa	Fancy rats are actually pretty big when they are full grown. if you are considering getting a rat that you don't want to get to big you should get a dumbo rat. I have one and he is pretty small. he is so cute and the ears are bigger though and on the side of the head. In my opinion though all rats are smart and i think that the biting would depend on their personality and the owner.|`|79ab050dbcc8861f2c6be1d80f755328aa	Fancy rats are considered all the rats that are pets ex. norway rats, some people might consider fancy rats that are used in shows, but that's not true. Anyways, rats are usually the same size, males are a little bigger though. All rats are smart, but people think that white ones are smarter because those are the ones that are used in labs and in training experiments, rats don't really bite unless they haven't been handled or they're being hurt or are really scared, some may be shy but they won't bite because of that.|`|z9NHRzk9aa	all domestic rats are fancy just different types like the dumbo has standard ears.what do you mean a "white" rat what kind is it a regular fancy,dumbo,rex,blue ect? rats only bite wen they are scared or do like you and also it could be they do not like to be held. all things grow so babys will grow up into adults duh. they get bigger when they are older(just except when they are adults they are full grown they don't grow anymore)|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Are fancy rats smaller than what? Wild rats? No, I wouldn't say so. At this point, at least, they are the same species of animal. One has simply been domesticated. There aren't enough physical differences to consider them separate species, though, and that includes the fact that they aren't particularly different in size.<br>  <br>  If you just mean "small," well, females tend to be a fair deal smaller than males, anyway. But they're still going to be larger than rodents like mice. Some rats are small enough to be held in your palm, others require two hands because they're so large. Females are usually closer to half a pound, while males are typically a pound or more. (There are plenty of exceptions, of course!)<br>  <br>  There is no difference in color. White rats are just as intelligent as agouti rats; agouti rats are just as intelligent mink rats; mink rats are just as intelligent as hooded rats; hooded rats are just as intelligent as beige rats; so on and so forth. Color doesn't matter. It's the individual rat.<br>  <br>  The friend who said they're the smartest may have thought so because lab rats are typically shown to be white. There are several different strains of laboratory rats. Wistar rats and Sprague Dawley rats are albino. Long-Evans rats are hooded. Zucker rats are characterized not by their color, but by their obesity and hypertension. Anyway, the stereotype of white lab rats may be why he or she believes they're the most intelligent.<br>  <br>  The friend who claimed they bite the most may think so because PEW rats (pink-eyed white) do have vision that is more impaired than blank-eyed rats (including the BEW, or black-eyed white). This is a guaranteed excuse or anything, but animals with bad vision are generally quicker to bite in defense because they can't quite see the threat as well. Or, perhaps they knew adopted-out lab rats. While many are perfectly friendly (such as the Sprague Dawley lab rats), other [white] lab rats live in fear of humans because of rough treatment, nonexistent socialization, et cetera. <br>  <br>  I suggest joining the forum <a href="http://www.goosemoose.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.goosemoose.com</a> as it is a thorough, informative source of information for potential rat owners and current rat owners alike. Please research fancy rats very well before you jump into buying a pair.|`|7AI58IS8aa	nooo depends on the personality. You can't judge anything or anyone just by their color!|`|q0rLBQo2aa	"are fancy rats smaller when they are full grown" No, as they age they get bigger. That's what *grow* means. The basic answer to all your questions is, Rats are (all) intelligent, which means the are  varialbe in behavior. They are also survivors, which means they are variable in size, temperament. They react to environmental conditions more than many dumber rodent pets. For example, IMHO guinea pigs are mindless lumps of fecal matter -- a dead and stuffed one would be better tan the real thing.<br>  <br>  Pets deserve more commitment and better care than such a vague question and such inexpert answers as you will get on this site.    Animals are not toys. Pets have no right to humane treatment because they are not human. BUT we have an obligation not to be cruel or neglectful, because as human beings we know better and have a moral duty to act in accordance with that knowledge. That's why it's called "humane" treatment. If you're not humane, you're not fully human.
w4DIPHf1aa	We need to know what light your using to drive the system...      heres a link about a few of your test results..    http://allabout-aquariumfish.blogspot.co...    And a basic link for plant problems    http://badmanstropicalfish.com/plant_pro...      The black and brown come from phosphates, the brittle from iron deficiency      Bubbles means the plants are working, it doesn't mean there totally healthy however.    seems a large water change is needed and more frequent water changes (20%) at most so you don't mini cycle.    Hairgrass is always problems so don;t use that as an indication, hairgrass needs major flow threw it or it collects algae.    Another thing 90% of plants are water column feeders not root feeders so a dry fert may a big problem. You have over nutrient water because the plants can't use it. You may want to try switching to a liquid based from kent or seachem like flourish.    your ammonia reading should always be around zero, anymore  is signs of an unstable tank cycle wise, the high nitrate shows me possibly that all 3 classes of bacteria haven't shown up in big numbers yet, again seachem stability  (very cheap) may help get the system going.    The white you see may be the begining of glassy plants, again  a sigh of iron defeincy,, iron should be your primary liquid dosing fert.    If you have alot of fish in the tank that only adds to the problem, planted tanks should be understocked not over. BUt not the end of the world they just add alot to high nutrient water and hence algae.    here is an algae guide aswell to help you in the future    http://theplantedtank.co.uk/algae.htm      bottom line...    Welcome to keeping plants..10-100 times the challege of fish..    be patient and don't get mad..fixing these problems should be part of the fun.      planted tanks are about balance    light is the plants gas pedal, carbon is there food and ferts are there vitamins.    one of these is out of balance and the whole thing crashes fast or slow. One of these or more is out of whack and algae takes over    your carbon level is very high, in fact double what i would reccomend 15-20 is good, 30 if you use T5HO lights..    6700k lighting...now your lights, there key.        A big water change 50% should be the first thing to do, make sure your not using carbon and maybe keep the lights on longer like 9 -10 hours.    good luck!!!|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	throw away all the plants and buy new ones be careful
XK9RLaPeaa	It is definitely best to leave her alone in the cage for 24 hours. In a quiet room with little traffic. This way she will get acclimated to her new environment. If she is taken out too much the first day, she might get traumatized and have behavior problems. It is hard to do since they are so cute, and your excited to have a new pet, but its best for them. Think, she has left her litter mates, her mother, her old environment, and her old care takers. She is going to be upset, and trying to comfort them the first day will make it worse. She will be ok if she has only been taken out a couple times, but let her rest the rest of the day. Good Luck!|`|m8TydIZJaa	Ya its fine to take them out of their cage(just dont let go of them!) My friend took her Guinea pig out of the cage the first day and it was fine!  I think they tell you that so it doesnt hurt you becuase its scared! They just want it to get used to its surroundings first! So unless your scared of getting bit or loosing it take it out of the cage!|`|KQCjZBRRaa	You can take her out of her cage, but I recomed that you don't. Give her a day or two to get used to her cage, then start to give her treats while she's in the cage. She'll get used to you bit by bit and then feel free to pick her up. :)    hope that helps. :D
CwNMq7RTaa	Since the kitten was found under a deck and it's much too late to bring it back to its mama and since cat behavior problems are only cat behavior problems, I hope you're not thinking of getting rid of it.  Yes, they can have problems but it's nothing you can't deal with. They could become clingy.  Like when you pet them they want it to go on all day. They keep wanting more.  Just push him away when you've had enough.  If he won't go away, put him outside the room and close the door.  Or they may have fears, be very skittish and nervous.  Sometimes they want dirty socks or other dirty clothes to suck on while they knead (work their claws)  Just let him do it.  It mimics the action of nursing so it provides some comfort.  I've never seen any major problems with a cat.  It's not a dog.  They don't trash the house or make noise all night or anything.|`|J3erdQCIaa	I got a kitten that was really young once, he had a few problems.  When we first got him he would sleep with us and curl up on my pillow and after I dozed off he would wake us up by sucking really loud on my hair, we barely got him to stop then I had a teddy bear that I had since I was little that he started sucking on its tummy.  He slept with that till he was about 2 yrs old, then he started molesting it, aka trying to hump it.  He also had issues with people, he wouldn't come out of our bedroom and when people came in, he would growl and hiss and try to attack but with us he was a huge baby.|`|iU2fQBtRaa	It is true, but not for all. Not exactly behavior problems, but I have a couple brother cats who still suck on our hair and blankets because they were taken away from their mother too early. If you can deal with knots in your hair and slobbered blankets, your good to go :)|`|aJSUlD0Baa	Not really. All cats have different attitudes just like people do. You just need to watch for bad behavior and correct it right away just like any other pet or animal.|`|IDcIww7Baa	No, not always. The best pet I ever had was a Tabby cat that lost his mother around that same age, he was very smart and a good friend. He lived for 18 years, I really miss him.|`|9dlRcS7caa	I think not. It is how you raise him that will predict his behavior. I for one found a kitten that still needed nursing. I bottle-fed him until he can eat solid food. Now he is a normal grown cat.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	no not really     my cat died 4 weeks after giving birth non of the kittens acted any different|`|AA11352641	It's possible, but it's not like you have a choice at this point. More than behavior, they need to remain with their mother for the milk.      I found one my cats when he was about 4 weeks old from under a dumpster. His mother and she rest of the litter died after the mama ate a mouse that ate mouse poison. He wasn't very good at grooming at first, I'd have to squirt him with a water bottle to stimulate him to lick his own fur, especially his bottom after going to the bathroom. He was also very rambunctious, I think it's because he didn't have his littermates to play with and learn from. He's 5 years old now and perfectly normal.|`|Y6xLu77aaa	I've never heard that before. My cat had kittens last April and she ended up dying 3 weeks later from a stroke. I had to supplement the kitten's diet with canned milk for cats. We kept one of the kittens and so far she is a real sweet heart, we haven't had any problems with her.
aJSUlD0Baa	He may not be getting enough blood flow to his ears. If the vet isn't real worried about it your friend shouldn't either. He can always take the cat to a Specialist if he feels something is really wrong because most vets don't specialize on one certain animal.
CfUVG6IYaa	Fleas can be so difficult to get rid of! It's the eggs that really cause the problem - they are absolutely maddening! Here is a good web site to take a look at:  http://www.stopthefleas.com/    The most important thing about getting rid of fleas, is getting rid of the eggs. When you vacuum, always change the vacuum bag - remove it and get it out of your house, otherwise the eggs in the bag will hatch and you will end up with more fleas.    I have found the best way to get rid of the fleas on the cat is by using the "back of the neck" stuff. Get something good from the vet, like Frontline.    Also, it is important to be aware that fleas carry tapeworm. It's disgusting I know, but when the cat eats the fleas, they can end up getting tapeworms. If you notice little things that look like sesame seeds around your cat's sleeping areas, those are tapeworm segments and you need to treat the cat for that as well. Fortunately it's easier to get rid of the tapeworm problem than it is to get rid of the fleas.    If all else fails, you may need to consult a professional exterminator. I had to do that one time - but it did fix the flea problem.    Best of luck!|`|kIIf9Z6Eaa	Flea baths and collars aren't effective.  Frontline, Revolution and Advantage are topical (back of neck) treatments that work, but it takes several weeks or months to totally eradicate the fleas.  Flea eggs are already everywhere in your house and they are hatching at differnt times.  The topical treatment and the bombs are getting some, but not all.  Skip the bombs, they don't hit every single surface in your home and why would you want to blanket your house in a pesticide?  Continue with the topicals religiously and eventually your problem will go away.  And keep the cat indoors.|`|OtvId52Taa	Do you have any other pet?    Also, have you washed all you clothes and dried them right after bombing? Because sometimes if there are damp clothes in a hamper the bomb can't reach them in the clothes. also the neighbors might have fleas in theirs and when you open the door they might jump in, and also make sure that the brand of flea killer is a good and strong one. I'm afraid I can't say anything else for you. Sorry. Hope what I said helps some though.
tfTQ6Cuuaa	Use baby shampoo and lukewarm water. If she's close to delivering and it could wait until after, that would be better. She's gonna get messy then anyway.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Yes but only use a good quality pet shampoo - best would be a hypo with no soap, detergents, dyes or perfumes.  Do not use any medicated or flea products or any doggie colognes or dog conditioner.  You don't want anything that might leave any residue on her skin that will bother the pups. Try to dry her well & if using a ppl dryer only use on the low setting so she doesn't get overheated or skin burned.|`|2O58btqxaa	depends how far she is if it s not near her due date  then yes should be ok|`|6qsocyK3aa	I would imagine so as long as she isn't in labour and you use special dog shampoo.  But you breeding mentor would know this, you have got one right?|`|MGAmNxddaa	No medicated bath..especially flea medication........a bath with a mild shampoo with a good rinse would be okay...I hope you are in a warm climate though.I live in Ohio and would never choose to bathe a dog in mid winter here,unless absolutely necessary.|`|AA11900592	Yes, you can give a pregnant dog a bath. Use mild dog shampoo and be gentle to the new mom to be! Best Wishes!|`|GpiRaSvPaa	As long as she's not about to have her pups at any second, it's okay to give her a bath. Just be very gentle with her, you don't want to hurt the pups. And just try to bathe her as quickly as possible to avoid having her stress out for very long. Oh, and last but not least, do not use any of the shampoos that claim to kill or keep away fleas and ticks. You don't want anything on her that could hurt the pups when they come. I would suggest using a gentle oatmeal shampoo or something like that.|`|GTqqz7kPaa	yeah sure, but make sure it isnt to warm, it will kill the puppy.|`|J1HsG21Gaa	I wouldn't give her too many, however I would definately give her a bath before she goes into labor so that her **** are clean etc.... Just watch if she starts to act stressed|`|nI8G21y8aa	yah mama needs to look hot for her new babies!    well ifr shes not too close to her due date then yah shell be fine.
AsSMWbdyaa	There are a couple things that can be done to save the fry. One is to provide plants for the fry to hide in. The other is to use a commercial breeding trap, which separates the babies from the mother when they are born. Of the two solutions providing plants for hiding places is the best option and puts the least stress on the mother. If you are unable to keep the fry separate, having lots of hornwort in your tank (both floating and planted) will help to protect the fry.|`|ErSbeRlzaa	Like shanna said give them some cover the fry are small and manouvarble once they uncurl which is immiediatly. If you don't have any to spare take them out of the main tank. Plants, ornaments, marbles, or ne thing small enough that the mother can't get into.|`|SArRAmYHaa	This is easy..take the small plastic bin that is used to hold your fish before they put them in the bag at the petshop. Drill small holes enough for the fry to swim out into the tank but the platy stays in till you can seperate the fry so they dont become lunch!!
KxjUim7yaa	She may be having a false pregnancy. They can even produce milk and make a nest. She is not mothering the new puppies, but warning them away from her nest area. Keep them separate from her. Don't trust her alone with the puppies.You can call your vet if you like.|`|AA10471659	Ardy is right False pregnancy happens quite a bit. They are wired to welp and feed pups and this pup invasion started this.

Watch her when she is  around them.|`|giCUEYsJaa	I would say your dog is suffering from False Pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  Take her to the vet for a complete check up.  She might be a bit too old to spay but please spay/neuter your new puppies.<br>  <br>  Important...keep your puppies away from her - she could kill them.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	false pregnancy get her spayed and it will stop|`|24b558aaf77e8dc4e04518b037561692aa	Dogs do have false pregnancies , even when no puppies are around and they do fill the glands with milk.<br>  <br>  Why your dog is acting aggressive towards these pups I don't know,<br>  but I would be very careful to keep the older dog away from the puppies.<br>  She is hormonal and may be upset because they are there, or, or<br>  is your job to protect the pups from her though.<br>  <br>  Might borrow a net type playpen for babies to keep the pups in for their safety.<br>  <br>  A vetcould give your dog an injection to dry up her milk.<br>  Call and discuss the situation with your vet and tell him she is aggressive towards these pups.|`|jPBO4ABPaa	Oddly enough her motherly instincts are kicking in. Why she acts towards in that manner I don't know. I had found 4 stray kittens one day and brought them home. My dog which has never had a litter of pups developed milk and took the kittens in as her own. It was unbelievable the way she raised them as if they where her own.<br>  Personally I don't think she needs to see a vet, perhaps she feels like growling at the other dogs is protecting the pups. In time she will get use to them. If the pups are female that could be it too. I know my female dog is the alpha female and she does not like any female dogs around her.<br>  I know this didn't exactly answer your question, but hoped it helped some.|`|entB7tPQaa	Has she gotton away? Maybe she was inpregnted then.<br>  But maybe its just natural when there are babies. Maybe when she growls at the puppies she just disaplining them like any mother dog does. Perhaps take her to the vet as a precaution. Also, get her spayed. I believe that would end any milk production, and she'd be less moody.|`|KuUx34hCaa	She may be suffering from false pregnancy|`|bIaywrBCaa	could be falso pregnancy or could be an infection in the glands and not milk. I would take her to the vet.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Yeah they can start to produce milk when they are around puppies.. She should have been spayed years ago.. Take her now..

Cichlids are naturally inquisitive fish and very smart. They can be taught to jump out of the water for food and even let themselves be petted and eat from your hand.

So I was told they all had to go into the garage, I duly transferred everything however, the pair of Oscars stopped feeding, after over a week I put them back in a bucket and transferred them back to the original tank in the house. They fed for a day and stopped feeding again. This continued for a few weeks with me moving them backwards and forwards in a bucket until one day, I put them in the bucket walked round the garden in the front door out the back and back in to the tank they came from, needless to say they ate, and from that point every other day they had to be put in a bucket and taken for a walk.|`|AA11556697	Never had experianc with african chiclids YET...But i had Angles at the foot of my bed, they would acually sit and watch me in the morning when the sun came up until i got up and then they would move to the front of the tank waiting for their food...They definatly recignized me it was funny to watch them with this behavior sad they passed on....|`|lzmAVkuOaa	they are intelligent thats for sure.<br>  I can walk into my kitchen with my convicts and the do their little feed me dance, but yet my sister can walk in and they hide.

G032Flc3aa	I think you're doing the right thing getting the lumps checked out, more than likely there'll be a simple explanation and treatment and you'll have peace of mind.  We had a beautiful ginger cat, Felix, and he used to have the spots too, I'd forgotten about them until I saw your post but he had a pink nose and he got a spot right in the middle of it.<br>  <br>  I don't know anything about rabies shots with living in the UK but you obviously love your cat very much so I know you'll do whatever is recommended for her health and safety and WELL DONE for ditching the vet who recommended declawing your baby, if more people did that they'd soon realise that it's a thing of the past.  Good luck! Let us know please x|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	lumps could be anything, vet will know.<br>  <br>  rabies shots, like all other shots, need to be discussed with vet. some areas require rabies by law, others vet recommend it.<br>  how often it is given also depends on the vet and the local law.<br>  <br>  if the the vet recommends rabies shot, i would get it.<br>  if a rapid raccoon attacks your cat through a window screen while she is sleeping, they might be forced to put her down, if she did not have a rabies shot.|`|YrSKMmdCaa	your right it is to be safe then sorry because it might not be to serious or it can be the most serious thing out there.|`|QC6oBb2iaa	The bumps you're feeling are probably nothing, but you're right--better to be safe than sorry!<br>  <br>  Yep, orange cats (particularly the buff colored lighter ones) tend to get freckles.  Think of them as the redheads of the cat world.<br>  <br>  Yes, your cat should have a rabies shot every year, even if she's indoor-only.  Think what would happen if she got out and encountered a rabies carrying animal!  Or, heaven forbid, if some rabies carrier should get in!  Remember, bats are one of the more common species to carry rabies, and they can get in through very, very tiny spaces.  I've had them in my house before.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Rabies shots depends where you live how often they are administered.  If shes due, you would have gotten a notice, but the vet might recommend one.  If so, just go ahead, it will save you a trip in the future.  The coloration of the gums is common not only in cats but dogs.  Golden Retrievers get this a lot, my Molly has it, and its totally fine.  I will definitely keep her in my prayers, I am sure she will be fine ;).<br>  <br>  The lumps could be SO many things, from a little break out to some minor muscle tearing where an abscess has formed, to litter stuck under her fur.  Only the vet is going to be able to tell you for sure.  Good luck!!!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	My 2 orange tabbies have the black spots too.  That should be normal but ask just put your mind at ease. I'm not sure about the lumps, fingers crossed it's nothing serious.  Rabies shots are usually required by law and I know my vet requires me to get it for any animal I bring in over 3 months old. Ask about the 3 year shot.  After the first vaccination, some vets only require it be done every 3 years after that.  Make sure to write down questions as you think of them.  I'm bad to draw a blank once I get into the exam room and it helps to have a "cheat sheet" to help me remember what I wanted to ask.  Good luck to her and hopes for an all clear from the vet.
EJpiaCMQaa	Mallard ducks live 5-10 years in the wild.<br>  <br>  Pekin ducks live for 9-12 years.<br>  <br>  Indian Runner ducks live for 8-10 years.<br>  <br>  Muscovy Ducks can live for 7-8 years.<br>  <br>  Those are some of my favorite ducks.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Depending on the breed, up around twelve years.|`|FVxYIuP4aa	5 to 10 years, even longer depending on breed.
eSCI09Klaa	A Vlaampred is an actual breed, like a Friesian or Arabian, so the only way to get one would probably be by getting a purebred. <br>  <br>  For a Clydesdale, breed them with a Cleveland Bay, or Arabian. You will be very surprised what you will get if you breed a Clydesdale and Arab together!
MmRDzhaHaa	What have you been feeding him? as pork can cause this they cant digest it,my dog had this once after over doing it with the pork! try giving a light meal of chicken and rice(no chicken skin gives the runs),and at the same time make an appointment for a check up at the vet.|`|bIaywrBCaa	a vet can help you, we can't. Take him now.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	That means its time to take the dog to a vet with a stool sample. No one here can diagnose your dog. Cryptorchism will not effect it.|`|TJGje2blaa	Sounds like you're not keeping the shots up to date on him.  Anytime there is a blood discharge, seeing a vet is crucial.|`|cETQuE9waa	Take your dog and a stool sample into the vet.
a4NCKYyZaa	If you want loving and lazy get a mastiff!  Be sure to research the breed in depth.  Learn about their health problems and needs.  www.offa.org has lots of health, personality and mastiff needs info.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	my parents have a great dane/mastiff. she is great! she is very playful which can be a bad thing sometimes since she's huge. she's very loyal, but she scares easily. when she gets scared, my mom can't control her. i'll post a pic of her in a couple mins.<br>  <br>  She's the one on the right and she's about 110 pounds. Her head is bigger than mine. Be sure that you really want a big dog. They are a lot of work.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w272/wokeupinaz/pup.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w272/...</a><br>  <br>  I think mastiff is calmer, but I might be wrong.|`|kixQWODVaa	Mastiffs are a much calmer breed than danes.  I would recomend a mastiff
VTee51r9aa	My hermit crab (Mr. Crabs) did this, he came out of his shell  had various other types and sizes of shells in his tank so he could pick one. But he stayed out of his shell for two days and then he died. Just make sure you have other shells for him to choose and try not to add more stress for him.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	Leaving a shell is not a moult. A hermit crab will only leave their shell if something is seriously wrong. <br>  <br>  Signs of moult are usually:<br>  <br>  Eating and drinking more than usual a week or so prior. They only stop eating a short time before<br>  <br>  more digging activity but less over all activity.<br>  <br>  sometimes they look a little duller than usual<br>  <br>  Was the tank humid and warm enough for him? Those are the most common reasons for ditching a shell.  The next runner up would be chlorine in the water.<br>  <br>  Changing shells has nothing to do with moulting.|`|zujFYopvaa	I don't know, sorry, but you can go to google and ask google :)|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Put snacks all around the cage and tons of different typed shells mostly bigger though not to big and just scatter them all over the place, hopefully he picks one before dying. I hope all is well.|`|gZrxE2aOaa	Yes...i hope you've provided a bigger shell for them to move in to...or you might have a lil problemo....lols <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck :]
3giaPYe8aa	Well, it may have not been a planned pregnancy, but it still is your fault.  You know, the dogs can't make their own appointments to be spayed or neutered, nor can they pay for it.....that would have been your job.  And yes, it's too soon to tell anything.  Unless you go for an x-ray or ultra sound at the proper time, you probably won't know anything until at least 2-3 weeks before she is due. (9 weeks gestation)|`|bIaywrBCaa	too early to tell, even for a vet. They usually do not start showing until they are 5-6 weeks along. You can tak her in about 2 weeks and have an ultrasound done.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	It's too early to tell.<br>  <br>  And yes, you ARE irresponsible for allowing them together while she was in heat.  You did not prevent it, so it was NOT "accidental".|`|hYRYO5GYaa	hey being such a small dog it is possible for her to start showing already. dog pregnacys only last about 55-65 days. so its possible|`|KvUJZa1Paa	You are right, dogs don't know what is good for them. That is why they have humans as owners. We make the decisions for our pets. And you allowed them to mate, it wasn't accidental from what I have read. And if it wan st planned then just what do you call it, 1 female dog under a year old first heat, 1 male dog willing to do the dirty with her, and they are left in a room where no one is watching them and they tie. Well in my minds eye that is planned.<br>  Now take the female to vet and have her aborted and spayed, because there is way to many  dogs in shelters and rescues now. Some 2 million dogs every year in the USA are put down and BYBers like you allow there dogs to make more.|`|aCqSF87Raa	No, they don't know what's best for themselves: much like young children. That's why it's up to US as OWNERS to make sure they don't get hurt. Or pregnant at too young of an age, which can lead to their injury or even death.<br>  <br>  So you don't THINK they will be abandoned or neglected, but it's very likely that a year or two down the road these pups will end up in shelters because your "family" couldn't keep them. Or even sooner because they backed out last minute and you had to drop them off yourself or go through other sources to find homes.<br>  <br>  What happens if you can't afford a c-section should mom need it? Or you don't provide proper vet checks and fail to recognize signs of whelping difficulties? What if the pups are still born, sick, deformed? What if mom kills them? What if she passes on poor genetics or develops brucellosis?<br>  <br>  Think of it this way if you really love animals: within six years your pair of dogs will have helped in the creation of over 60,000 dogs (providing each animal has one litter.) Only about 5,000 or less of those animals will have forever homes - the rest will end up in shelters, on the streets, or dead.<br>  <br>  Sorry but there is no such thing as an "accidental" pregnancy - either you supervised your dogs or you didn't. You better start saving up - it'll be about three grand MINIMUM for proper care for mom and pups within the next several months, five if there are any complications.<br>  <br>  PS - You're hurting her, risking her life, by not spaying. Hope you know that.|`|nlmkQeinaa	Maybe you can have your puppy pee on a stick.|`|KuUx34hCaa	first off dog should NEVER be breed under 18 month & really should wait until they are 2yr. as they are still pups until then & you DO NOT let dog decide when to breed they do not think like that you must be the responsible owner you should have your dogs mixed be RESPONSIBLE do the right thing|`|qapJU3tMaa	And your dogs are not spayed and neutered BECAUSE?  You are harming your dog by letting her carry a litter of pups.  You do know that your dog could easily die due to pregnancy/whelping problems.  You obviously don't love your dogs that much, otherwise they would have been fixed by now.  <br>  <br>  You have NO business breeding dogs when you have to ask questions on YA's.  <br>  <br>  Do you have upwards of $2000.00 should your dog need an emergency c-section.  Have you had all the health and genetic testing done?  Of course not, your dogs aren't old enough.  <br>  <br>  And, right, everyone says they want a pup until it comes time to take one home.  <br>  <br>  If you did your research, you would actually know that intact dogs have a much greater chance of cancers.  <br>  <br>  You bought your dogs out of the paper?  Reputable breeders do not have to advertise their pups in the local paper.|`|vouUQQzBaa	1.Yes it is your fault they bred. You didn't spay/neuter knowing full well they could have<br>  2.First cycle is NEVER EVER good to breed (now you are risking your girl as well)<br>  <br>  having said that, since damage has been done:<br>  <br>  3.Cannot tell a pregnancy at 2 weeks. 3 weeks is when typically you will start seeing enlarged or pinkish nipples.<br>  4.Take her to the vet as soon as possible. She will need to have blood work done, x-ray<br>  5.Start putting a substantial amount of money aside (don't know where you are, but where I'm located NY I'd say to put AT LEAST $1k aside)<br>  6.Be prepared with an emergency vet and regular vet, she may very well need a c-section<br>  7.Neuter your male ASAP and spay her right after the litter (assuming it took).<br>  8.Hope and pray you can place the pups, if not, be ready to be able to care for them.<br>  <br>  No one's trying to be mean to you, but going into breeding (if you don't know what you are doing and are not helping the breed) or not spay/neutering your pets IS irresponsible. You can't expect sympathy from others. Sorry
ggyUHxDMaa	Id give it to the nice Vietnamese Family living next door|`|AA10029366	I give your trolling attempt a C+.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Do NOT "throw it out" -- you have a responsibility to that living thing, that YOU choose to take responsibility for.<br>  <br>  Just because you've decided you want to back off from your responsibility, you still owe thaat dog a chance to have a decent life.<br>  <br>  Look in your phone book or on the web, for the nearest animl shelter. Then get the dog there.<br>  <br>  Do NOT just leave it somewhere.<br>  <br>  You'll survive having it round for the time it takes you to figure out where to take it.<br>  <br>  If you had any heart at all (which I gather you don't), you'd find a loving home for it, by asking around for who wants a dog, put up notices offering it for sale or for free.<br>  <br>  But at least get it to aa shelter -- call them, and see if they'll get it from you, or find some way to get it there.<br>  <br>  NEVER get pregnant or have any babies.

If there is not a pound around there you need to find the nearest one and take him there so he can be taken care of and not punished for your absolute STUPIDITY. <br>  <br>  I think YOU should be taken out in the middle of no where far enough so you cannot find your way home.<br>  <br>  <br>  Add: Jaimie why are you even in this section.

You dont take out the anger out on a dog, and you DONT THROW A DOG OUT SOMEWHERE. Just give it tio some one who wont take his or her anger out on it.<br>  <br>  P.S_ Why did you buy it when you dont even respect it enoug to search for a animal shelter or look up the number fo the local pound in the yellowbook or even BOTHER to look in the internet for either of those places near you!! If you let it go somewhere or tie it up infront of a dog park, u could get arrested. If you do abandon it, Do humanity and pets alike a favor and never even think of going near a pet again if you have any dignity left in you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Atleast you will save some money for yourself.|`|CEC87KZ7aa	OMG the person who said they dont want thier child anymore is so mean! .....i could see if you don't want the dog anymore cuz they take a lot of commitment and work.  BUT don't put it on the street! put of flyers, ask your family, friends if they want him/her.  please don't leave it on the street.  or find a vet or something, go find a pound or somethihng, but please dont let it go.  and for the girl who doesn't want her child, give it up for adoption, poor baby unwated by its own mother, its a very sad world.|`|PRG25iDIaa	Someone tell me this is a joke!!!! With these statements I understand why the boyfriend left. You break up and now its apparently the dogs fault, do me a favor and never have kids .<br>  <br>  1st if you know the breeder call them and see if they have any contacts. If it came from a pet store call them but good luck on that return, Get on the internet and contact a BREED RESCUE. AND LASTLY if none of the above work, go to the  Vet and be with him as he goes to THE BRIDGE; it's a hell of a lot more humane than tying him up somewhere and hoping your problem goes away.;|`|7gyvOQMWaa	That is extremely cruel but if you want an answer go online and look up rescue shelters or pounds in your area also if you go to a website like adopt a pet or pet finder you can put your dog up for adoption. There are plenty of people who will see your dog because I know that they are good sites I know because  am looking to buy a cat and I am on those sites all the time cats are coming and going so I am sure someone with a bigger heart than you will find your dog and fall in love with him/her. <br>  <br>  You should be ashamed of yourself you sick person. If I didnt want my kid anymore I would not just throw it in a dumpster! I would go to an orphanage just like you are going to go to a shelter.<br>  <br>  Good luck but if your dog can't find a home remember that if you "throw it out" you will most certainly go to hell.|`|jPBO4ABPaa	Good grief, don't just dump the animal. Put an add in the paper or something. Put fliers in your local stores. Please don't be cruel to the dog, you and your boyfriend picked him out, he didn't pick you. Take care of him until you can find a good home.<br>  Call the spca and see if there is one in your area.<br>  Keep making call until you find a home for your dog.|`|kixQWODVaa	first thing first do not just take him some where and dump him!  He could get hit by a car and get seriously injured or killed its not his fault your ex wont answer your calls.

aP4bkYOCaa	While I doubt there are actual published statistics out there, Chloe and especially Callie are extremely common names for calico-colored cats. I've known four Callies in my lifetime, all calico. My kitten's mother was a Chloe. :)<br>  <br>  Even if it isn't original, I'll bet your roommate's cat's name suits her. Best of luck to you both!|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	I have no idea but I'll bet it is fairly high as I have heard of that name assigned to a great number of calico cats. I have had 4 calicoes during my life and none of them were named callie or chloe. their names were/are; Gladiolus, Missy Kitty, Tammy, Rita Mae Brown|`|hoAeWwJDaa	A large percentage. However, I've also met Snickers, Mitsy, Bootsie, Patches, Amber, Maggie, Lulu, Angeline, Bambi, Dinah, and Roxy, a few Calico gals NOT named Callie, Cali, Cally, or Chloe. I met a dog named Cloe Cole, and dad admitted he looked at his own last name, and yes, lazily switched letters. Silly man. BTW, Dinah was the BEST of the calicos, less independent, less unpredictable, very loving, CONSISTENT and playful! Many Calico/Tortoiseshells share behavior characteristics, and they're not favorable traits typically, as any cat enthusiast knows :]|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Probably a lot of them. I've known three calicos tho (Buttercup, Casey & Chelsea)...No Callie's or Chloe's!|`|VTee51r9aa	I agree with that I have a calico cat named Cali.|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	60|`|5zaHlQtzaa	That is a funny question i have a calico named callie and a siamese cross named chloe. Just kind of ironic.
aP4bkYOCaa	First of all, you cannot rub your cat's face in his own urine. That is an extremely outdated form of punishment and he will never learn that way.<br>  <br>  Do not allow him into the baby's room.<br>  <br>  He isn't neutered and he needs to be. That is mostly likely why he is marking. Have him neutered as soon as you possibly can.<br>  <br>  While you're at the vet, ask them to test for a UTI, crystals or anything else that would make him urinate outside of his litter box.<br>  <br>  Make sure he has two litter boxes and make absolutely sure they are spotlessly clean.<br>  <br>  Lastly, he is new in your house and he might not be used to babies or young children. He is likely stressed out. There is a product available called Feliway, which has been known to fix behavioral problems in cats, from inappropriate urination to social problems. You can purchase it at most major pet stores. It is odorless (to us) and non toxic and could help your situation greatly.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Bambi... THIS IS NOT A DOG...you can't rub their nose in it..<br>  Does it have a sand box? IS IT CLEAN???<br>  does it like the sand that is in it.<br>  Does he have a urinary infection.<br>  IS HE NEUTERED... if not that will stop this marking!<br>  he may just be marking...<br>  <br>  often cats will mark to make sure everyone knows it is their territory.<br>  <br>  TAKE HIM AND HAVE HIM NEUTERED... NOW!   OR this will keep up!|`|QC6oBb2iaa	Chances are, he's trying to cover up the baby's scent by masking it with his own.  In the wild, it's a protective mechanism.<br>  <br>  It could also be that the litter box is dirty, or that he is jealous.<br>  <br>  The only way to stop it is to exclude him from the baby's room.  Cats generally don't get the hint that they've "gone" in the wrong place when you rub their noses in it.  They aren't like dogs.|`|LFeEoHj3aa	Your cat is jealous. My parents told me that when they had my oldest brother, the cat would get so jealous it would pee everywhere, they even saw the cat putting blankets over his head, HAHAHAHAHHAA...I guess it's a jealousy thing lol|`|4tOeSdXjaa	Cats arent dogs. They need to be excluded from the room. Most likely he is not use to the baby and is trying to show he is the alpha one, hence peeing in his bed. Keep the cat out of there. I have two cats =)
SHBpzAIZaa	Im really not trying to be smart... But you might get more informative answers if this question was in the dogs section instead of the reptile section...<br>  <br>  To answer your question, your puppy is probably a mix breed.|`|pcvcMePXaa	umm i believe they are short also, i believe your in the wrong section|`|2ZG1Bu9saa	The tails are usually cut at birth to prevent issues later on in life.|`|X0f444TOaa	Most owners cut the rot's tails short when the puppies are very young.|`|Q6osLdosaa	It is a Mix|`|2PkrD5dOaa	WHy is that here?

OMG! You are super lucky!<br>  <br>  Anyway the answer to your question is go to your vet they should be able to find out. Good Luck!|`|pcCfHYeSaa	If he looks like he has more than one breed in him than he's most likely a mutt. I can't tell you much because you didn't post a picture.|`|qapJU3tMaa	He's a mongrel.  You can have a DNA test done if you want to know which breeds he's made up of.
4hFT5JcLaa	What kind of python? How old and big is it?<br>  <br>  Smaller pythons, like ball pythons, don't need a lot of space at all. In fact, breeders will keep them in Rubbermaid containers with the lids on (holes in the sides for air, of course). Truth be told, if it's a ball, it can get stressed out by having too much space. They like to feel surrounded, because it makes them feel safe, and even if you gave them a huge room to live in, they'd still curl up in one corner.|`|2ZG1Bu9saa	www.lllreptile.com have very good prices on terrariums, and they ship to Canada.|`|AA11114358	you could always check on craigslist.com.

SnAsZapMaa	I quite agree.<br>  I won't have a BAR of any "german shepard". Nor of any "German Shepard". Nor of anyone who claims to be breeding them. Nor of anyone who claims to have obtained one.<br>  <br>  It takes determined ignorance to believe that there is such a thing as ARDing sheep, and that therefore a  breed would be developed to perform that task.<br>  <br>  I gather that you are commenting on some tv show. You'd be better off attending night school to learn English and a few other things that might be useful to you. My tv gets turned on once a year, maybe twice. Tv was SUPPOSED to be an educational tool and a means of communicating important things, but THAT idea soon became overwhelmed by the demands of advertisers for more time for their ads and for programmes that would attract a wide & gullible audience by being pitched so that even near-cretins could enjoy them (in between watching the ads, that is).<br>  <br>  Now, if Jon and Kate wanted a GSD from me they would have to<br>  (a) show me a door opening straight into a yard fenced to not only keep their dog home but to also keep stray dogs & stray brats OUT,<br>  (b) be willing to have someone home 24/7 for at least the first week, preferably fortnight, and<br>  (c) convince me that they will attend training classes long enough to graduate at least once (which most of my countrymen achieve in 8 weeks, but there are always lazies who need to repeat the initial course - I try to avoid letting them have one of my pups).<br>  <br>  Not watching Jon & Kate I have no idea whether the script-writers have them meet those requirements. Tv being aimed at the lowest behaviour groups, they probably don't - can't have those beer-guzzling consumers of the sponsors' products feeling uncomfortable about the actors showing higher standards than the watching couch-potatoes possess!<br>  <br>  As for GSDs and children:<br>  We had a 9 month and a 16 month GSD when our son was born. The nearest he ever came to injury were (1) when he was nearly dropped because a damp nose jogged an elbow of whoever was nursing him, as a quiet "I'm here and I'd like a fuss, too" reminder, and (2) when I let him know in no uncertain terms that he was never again to sit on a litter of puppies - the dam had let him get away with it.<br>  I have taken a 5-6 months GSD to school for a discussion session with 5-6 years old children about how to behave around dogs - that was a very low socio-economic area, with many of the parents being immigrants struggling to learn English.<br>  I have had 2 bitches start a fight right next to visiting children who were playing with the pups of one of those bitches. The children were never in danger, and after I dragged the dam down the hill to the pens and put her away the older of the children brought the other bit.ch down for me.<br>  I have also had a visiting child bitten - as he was coming through the gate, last in a group of 4 boys, he suddenly turned and ran away, and before I could react, one of the bitches that had been greeting each boy had stopped him - all dogs will chase almost anything that runs away. Fortunately a GSD is satisfied to hold, and doesn't consider it necessary to shake & tear. But even so, two-to-four punctures in a leg HURTS.<br>  Yes, GSDs ARE protective of their "pack", and so whenever our son had a friend over to play the digs were penned or brought inside, so that they wouldn't think that rowdy dash-everywhere boys' games required them to "protect" Gordon.<br>  <br>  If you genuinely had problems, then the logical conclusions are:<br>  (1) You have no idea about how to choose a pup.<br>  (2) You were too lazy to put the time into socialisation & training your pup (there are very few kinds of training you can do while watching tv....).<br>  (3) You were too lazy & stupid to socialise and train your child(ren).<br>  (4) You were too stupid to separate or supervise when children visited to play.<br>  <br>  As for the breeds you recommend:<br>  They are not actually children's dogs - too big, too solid, too strong (and Labs are often too damned stubborn!).<br>  My childhood dogs were Fokkers, the Fox Terrier side giving them the spirit to enjoy boy-type activities, the Cocker Spaniel side (that's GENUINE Cocker Spaniel, not the show-ring-is-all excessively-coated American Cocker) giving the affection to want to please plus a pleasantly-soft coat. There are very good REASONS why blind children usually get given a Cocker cross (such as the low-allergenic CockaPoos) as their guide dogs. But active adults do better with a GSD as their guide.<br>  <br>  Hmmm - seems as though not one section of your opinion & advice is actually worth having, Mr/Mz Troll.<br>  <br>  No C- (a "gentleman's pass") for your effort. It's a flat F.<br>  Les P<br>  owner of GSD_Friendly:  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_Friendly">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_F...</a><br>  "In GSDs" as of 1967|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Well lets analyze this. First of all if your going to rant please learn to spell the object of your rant. It's German SHEPHERD. <br>  <br>  Second of all, they have a right to get whatever dogs they want as long as they learn to train them I have no beef.<br>  <br>  Third of all, NO dog is born AGGRESSIVE, Its an individual dog trait not a breed trait.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Why not?  And its "Shepherd".<br>  <br>  <br>  I'd give it a C- also.|`|OWGBAiXtaa	I don't really have an opinion on the suitability of the German shepherd breed for families with children, but I don't know what they were thinking when they decided to get TWO shepherds for the family.  I was surprised that the breeder even allowed the family to buy two puppies from the same litter at the same time.  Two puppies= twice the work, poop, training, and attention.  Many reputable dog breeders will not sell two puppies to a single family for that reason.<br>  <br>  The breeder also seemed to drop the ball when he suggested that the family could take both puppies home that day even after he was told clearly that the family was not prepared to have the puppies in their home that day.  Jon had to scramble to set up the exercise pen, and I don't know what they did about getting bowls, food, and other necessities.<br>  <br>  The breed of dogs seemed to be Jon's choice and he seemed to make the decision to get two puppies as well.  <br>  <br>  The breeder of the puppies is an ex-police officer, so if he is breeding dogs that could be trained as police service dogs, the puppies could prove to be too driven and hyper-active for the family to manage well.  This is precisely the type of puppy you do not want to buy two of at the same time since they require individual attention and should not be allowed to bond with other dogs, but rather with a strong willed and experienced trainer/handler.<br>  <br>  Kate is just too busy with the children and too obsessed with having a clean house to deal with two German shedders (LOL) in her house.  I hope the dogs work out and in fact, they have so far.  The episode of J and K + 8 you are refering to was filmed three weeks before Christmas, and the puppies are still with the family according to the show's website.|`|PRG25iDIaa	As an owner and breeder of GSDs for over 30 years, I am very offended by your comments. 1st of all you have No idea of what the hell you are talking about; 2nd the GSD is one of the most loyal and protective of ALL breeds. I ought to know my oldest daughter is alive because of her  PET GSD. These dogs do demand socialization and training, they do not do well kept outside and unattended, but then if that's all you want out of a dog don't buy one.

sbB0TpGXaa	I am told top reiners also tend to be a little sickle hocked.  Not too severely so as to impede soundness but just enough to aid in quick stops.    Your MFT is already pretty well fit.  How is the gimpiness on her rear leg going?  Is she coming out of it? (from your previous question)  If these are recent photos I would say she already has.    One of the advantages of MFT's is their stamina.  In longer competitions they will often out compete the QH's.  In shorter ones they will sometimes fall a little short, but they can learn and learn well.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.    .|`|qw9ZjAlDaa	First of all, wow, I WISH I had that many photos of my horses.  And good photos too!  I'm impressed.  I'm lucky if I take 10 photos a year.  I know I'll regret it one day when they are gone :(    I think your mare looks great.  She is really fit.  Remember, you can't change the slope of her shoulder, you can only change her muscling.  And I think she looks very fit.  Sure, she can tone up some more, but she's a MFT, she will never have the big round muscly butt of a QH, which is typically what most reining horses are.  Her butt is already muscly for MFT (a lot of them tend to be pretty goose rumped) so I think you are doing well.|`|XL62syrCaa	First of all you have a GORGEOUS horse (I love the blue eye!) and i am definitely impressed at the quantity and the quality of the photos!    But to our question:    You cant change the slope of her shoulder. That is the way she is built. She looks to be in good shape but she needs more toning in her rear area. She could definitely do reining. but I doubt she could compete with cowy breeds such as QH, Paint, Azteca, etc.,....|`|XsBIITFvaa	I think your mare has good conformation for reining, but she needs more muscle in her butt. She looks bold, and not easily intimidated. I couldn't picture her bing scared of cows. If you can't get her over her fear of cows, then reining is really fun. I believe I like reining better than cutting. Both reining and cutting is hard on her joints, so keep her supplemented. :]    ***A horse can do anything, no matter breed or conformation. If she has the right heart, and the right head, then they can do anything asked of them***    EDIT: Sorry!! For some reason I thought you were still talking about cutting. Blonde moment!! haha|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Personally, I wish her neck wouldn't be as stocky and that her shoulders would be more round and she should have a more round butt with not a lot more muscle but some.    People are telling you to pile on muscle but that is WRONG. A reining horse shouldn't be super stocky. Horse trainers are finding out now that horses from stock lines are actually worse compared to thinner horses in the reining circuit. It's because the slimmer ones are faster and more agile, making their moves swifter and flow better. But I guess it depends on preference!    Also, calm horses don't always do well in reining! I talk to many reining trainers and ask them what they look for in a reining horse and they all look for very moody horses with tons of attitude. That way when they're out in the show ring, they always give it their best and leave an impression. Stallions often win over geldings. Take a guess as to why!    But, if you aren't planning on going pro with her, I would definitely say go for it! She looks like she could have some great potential in her! Good luck!!|`|yY6Aj1xpaa	Don't let 'em kid you...conformation is hugely important in the reiner, working cow horse world.  If you have a major "hole" in your horse's conformation, either in the slope of the hocks, fetlocks (sickle hocks),  a weak loin which will prevent your horse from "getting into the ground" on a sliding stop, spin or rollback over the hocks, you'll pay for the imperfections in vet bills.  Your horse will be unable to "hold" a stop as he hasn't the strength through his loins.   A flat croup will not help you either as it doesn't allow your horse to go as deep into the ground on a stop.  Although some of the other breeds would try to convince the rest of us that it hasn't affected their horses' movements, I've yet to be convinced from the majority of the wanna be reiners....     Exceptionally heavy muscling through the forearms and shoulder will not help you either.  All of that bulk prevents a smooth spin or turnaround.      Strong gaskins and hindquarters are mandatory.  As is good balance which you mentioned...    Here's a link from Bob Avila, at the top of the working cow horse, reiner game....also hints from Al Dunning and others.    http://special.equisearch.com/downloads/...    Bob Avila on body control..............hugely important, without it, you don't have a thing going for you...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iqXKzXTd...    Todd Bergen at the NRHA 2007 Finals..........  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2EEcJ48X...    You mentioned low head carriage...yes, it's important to have that horse's neck come straight out from his shoulder....tough to rein when you have a horse's head in your face.   If you show, it certainly detracts from the overall profile.      Reiner judges have a preference for a particular "look" on a reiner particularly at breed shows.  Familarize yourself with that.    Yes, reiner trainers are looking for a responsive horse...hot, moody doesn't get it done...they're difficult to train, unreliable and you cannot depend on them in the pen.  It's in the training...there are those that wash out but bloodlines really make a difference....a competent trainer and a beautifully bred horse win it EVERY time...ask Todd Bergen.|`|vow5ULxTaa	good build but for reining you need to get muscle on that but.  and yes you are right on on what a horse needs to be a good reiner    and despit what other people say. MFT's make great reiners becasue of there cow sense that they are naturally born with.  And MFts may not ever get the build of a quarter horse there butts are still strong.  yours just needs to be built up some.

They look like underwater spider plants. Or you can just buy them with the runners already on them.    There is a cool plant that looks like an amazon sword (I think its a variety of the same) only it has frilly leaves (my pleco thinks this is his food and eats them unfortunately).    I only keep the amazon swords because you can get different sizes and use them as foreground as well as background plants. And they are very hardy!    If you want variety, plant some slender grass types of plants in the front of the glass and you can also thread the amazons through your other tank decorations, logs, etc. to give it an overgrown look.|`|o9dMd2rBaa	You need a variety of plants, you need red plants, green plants, light green plants, pink plants.     You need a powerful light source instead of the standard 15W or w/e the common kind of fish tank light is as since red/pink plants need more light or else they will turn to green and/or lose their leaves    CO2 Injector    Fish    Substrate, there is some specialty substrate that promotes the growth of plants|`|XF9596Xraa	Don't, So live plants produce snails, and then there are so many snails that you tank gets dirty, eventually killing all your fish.

UIM8X38Oaa	The answer is Yes and No,<br>  some are gaited (your pacers)  and it depends on the ability of the rider. Gaits are like dancing just like we can learn different dances they can learn different gaits and here are their gaits:<br>  walk<br>  running walk, <br>  trot,<br>  pace,<br>  rack,<br>  canter<br>  <br>  And there are ones that not gaited:<br>  walk <br>  trot<br>  canter.<br>  It ultimately does depend on the rider though, I have an arabian which I have ridden with alot of TWH's and he is almost capable of a running walk.  He can keep up pretty good.  But I do ride TWH's as well so working on the running walk is not new to me.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps,<br>  Thanks for the good question.<br>  Jenny<br>  <br>  Blair  below me said it wonderfully|`|1WkO82e2aa	Some are and some are not. Some of the horses that went into breeding the morgan originally were gaited but not all of them, so not all of the morgans are gaited. If that makes sense. Some can be trained to gait because they are built to be able to but it may not be the most comfortable gait for them. Just like some walking horses would prefer to canter instead of rack. Just depends on training and build of that particular horse.|`|OUktzBqlaa	Hey i ride and work with Morgan horses and the answer is morgan horse naturally don't have a a 5 gait unless they are trained to! A normal morgan horse is just like any other normal horse! But some people can train the horse to have a new gait! Good luck in your class|`|3YHZUuhyaa	Some morgans are and some aren't. It just depends. I have a morgan and probably CAN do a different gait but I don't know how to make him go into it. <br>  <br>  =D|`|4U93EoUtaa	There are types of Morgans.  The original Morgan was not a gaited horse. It was actually very popular out west before quarter horses were!  Also very popular in the civil war. Some time after 1930 a lot of Saddlebred was added in, and now they are shown as gaited, but the original, foundation breed was not a gaited type breed.<br>  <br>  Try searching on lippitt morgan, foundation morgan and morgan saddlebred cross.  That should give you some information.|`|ajj7ATyAaa	99.999% of morgans have a walk, a trot, and a canter.<br>  There are a few who can also gait....  But it's not that common.  <br>  <br>  I think the confusion comes with them being used as saddle seat horses, the same as a lot of gaited breeds.  Some saddle seat horses are gaited whether naturally (like the twh, icelandic, MFT, et... ) or unnaturally (where they have the genetic and physical propensity to being able to do it but must be taught... as with the Saddlebred and NSH gaited horses).  But not all breeds that are  shown saddle seat are what can be considered a gaited breed....
Rw7gi86Naa	An occasional small chunk of meat is fine for a treat but, no table scraps. A cat regularly fed human food will either lose his taste for his own food, or be too full to eat it. Either way, he will lose the essential nutrients, including taurine, which are necessary for cats to survive and thrive. Even the water your cat drinks is important. Tap water is not healthy for cats because it has metals and other contaminants in it. Distilled water or natural spring water is best.<br>  <br>  Kittens in particular are very curious and play with everything that comes in their way.  Remember that they are inexperienced like toddlers and try everything at least once.  Make your home as kitten-proof as possible. Keep an eye on kittens when they are young and very inquisitive. Dangling cords are particular attracting to them and dangerous if chewed through.  Electric shock can be the result.<br>  <br>  - Put something distasteful on the cord to discourage chewing.<br>  - Tabasco sauce, cayenne pepper, bitter apple/orange, orange/lemon peel, commercial repellents.<br>  - Gaffer’s tape, (available in DIY stores) will probably work if the substances don't.<br>  - Secure exposed cords.<br>  - Consider permanent wiring if you own your place.<br>  <a href="http://www.catcatcat.com/behav5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catcatcat.com/behav5.html</a><br>  <br>  Chewing on these cords poses hazards to your cat, from minor shock to death. Cats primarily chew on cords out of boredom, especially if left alone during the day. Try to provide plenty of "play-alone" toys for your cat or kitten, including wall or door mounted toys they can swat or bat around, cat towers to explore, with attached toys for added interest, even an arrangement of cardboard boxes on the floor to form a tunnel, with holes cut through the sides. <br>  To handle the cord situation itself, you need to devise a way to cover the cords, discourage access to them, or make them unpalatable for chewing. <br>  - Cover the cords: Many computer supply stores carry pre-split hollow tubing for covering cords and electrical wires, as well as kits for managing computer cords. If you're handy with a utility knife, you can purchase flexible poly tubing in several diameters, in most building supply or hardware stores. Slit one side of the tubing, then cut it to length for each cord. You might also try larger "corrugated" tubing to run several wires through, if that works for you. <br>  - Discourage access to the cords: Try applying several rows of double-sided sticky tape to the floor surrounding a large cord tangle (such as frequently happens with computers). Cats will be reluctant to walk across the tape. Another excellent tool for keeping cats out of any undesirable area is the SssCat! cannister by Multivet. This product is a three-pronged training tool which works with a motion detector atop the cannister which triggers a high-pitched alarm and a quick spray of harmless material. It's a lot more expensive than bitter apple spray, but well worth the cost in its versatility for training purposes. <br>  - Make the Cords Taste Bad: By far one of the best training tools for any kind of destructive chewing is bitter apple spray. It is guaranteed to leave a bad taste in your cats mouth, one that he won't long forget.|`|LFeEoHj3aa	The switch to cat food would be easy if you got them hungry enough to want to eat the nasty cat food. Although, if it's healthy for a human, its healthy for an animal. And if you can afford to cook them steak, and veggies, GOD BLESS YOU! =)<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, I don't think you can train a cat like a dog, so it will probably be a hard thing to do lol<br>  <br>  To stop the scratching of the furniture, you can peddy paw your cats claws, or buy them some more scratching toys, like scratching post and stuff (never clip an animal's claws, it hurts them! You should file them down with the tool called peddy paws, you can buy it anywhere!)..also, so they don't bite the wires, give them like string attached to a toy so they chew that string! Or spray some gross smelling, bitter taste on the wires they're chewing...|`|qc9iax2maa	well I had the same problem. Here's what you do :) first, when you catch them doing something bad, you say "NO!" and look at their inner soul, not just their cute little bodies. And when you give them dinner, separate them more! And keep watch too! Put them on a diet, so therefore they have breakfast, dinner, and snacks if they're hungry in between. You should give them canned food for their meals, and hard food as snacks, so it'll keep them healthy. I know it'll be hard at first, but you should get used to it soon :D<br>  good luck!!|`|twVyisGnaa	Although I don't have any cats, and boy, do I want pet cats someday, you gotta set boundries and limits.

Oh yeah, and try to hide your valuables and stuff away from them where they can't find it.  As for dinner, don't feed them all at once,  Try to keep them seperated when you give them dinner, and then give them their dinners one cat at a time.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|6eqJSffkaa	Oh my goodness, no wonder you dread dinner time.<br>  <br>  Even though your cats seem so out of control I'm sure you'll be able to find something to help you in the resource below.

Don't hit them of course!<br>  You can splurt a little water in their face if they jump up on the kitchen table. I stomp hard in the floor it's effective on mine. They do not jump up on the kitchen table and if they do push them off. <br>  Just stop cooking them those foods.<br>  Scratching isn't just a naughty thing. Buy a scratch pole, tell them off when they scratch other surfaces. And spray them with that spray that cats hate. Spray the scratch pole with the one they love.<br>  Can't remember the names now but they have them in the pet store.<br>  <br>  Get toys that are stringy as they seem to like cords and dangly stuff.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	You can get Bitter Apple to spray on wires so they won't chew. There are other brands of the same thing, I got some stuff called Chew Stop. It's not toxic and it won't hurt your cats but it will keep them away from stuff.|`|DtkLsetkaa	My friend, you have created monsters!!  Its going to take quite a commitment on your part to break them of these habits.  Anywhere they are scratching/biting, put some bitter apple spray or another citrus spray, but always remember for every "punishment" move you make, you must reward when they do the right thing, with treats AND praise!!  Cats typically eat only when they are hungry, but for treats and stuff like that they can tend to gorge.  Look into a good raw diet to help control their weight.  You have some work ahead of you ;)
5Bo1A5ROaa	I'm sure that you kitty is fine. He may have yelp[ed louder this time because he was surprised or even you could have caught some of his hair when you stepped on him. My cats love to walk right underneath my feet so they get stepped on a bit too. Then they yelp and run and hide from me because even though they were the one under my feet it had to be my fault :) . Believe me you would know if they got seriously injured. Anytime they try to walk they would yelp and if you pet them in the wrong spot they would yelp too. Just keep an eye on the kitty and if he isn't limping or favoring a leg you should be fine. On the off chance that you accidentally stepped on his mid section, just watch out for any behavior changes like eating, sleeping, or throwing up/ litter box stuff to make sure you couldn't have injured him internally. But from the sounds of it there is absolutely nothing wrong with your guy!|`|OjXvYEZDaa	Your cat seem to be fine after that accident, if he cries and acting strangely, take him to the vet for safe side, but I honestly think ur cat is fine don't worry|`|VPycXVIlaa	He's probably fine. I've stepped on my cat a few times as well. If you notice him limping or dragging his tail then you'll probably want to take him to a vet.. but from your description it sounds like he's fine.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	I'm sure he's fine.  I can't count the number of times I've accidentally stepped on a tail or paw.  They usually do react with an alarming yelp... mainly to let us know what's happening so we'll stop.  The volume of the yelp can't be equated with the level of injury (or lack thereof).  Unless he begins to limp, his tail begins to swell or he behaves way differently there's not anything to worry about.  Just give him a little space to "get over it" and he'll be just fine.|`|KjzsYV9uaa	call spca on yourself, your a bad person.|`|MZ8uqhNEaa	Aww! Poor thing, but he will be fine. It is not like you meant to step on him! :)    If he limps, drags his tail, or just isn't acting normal (besides the fact he may be sulking) then take him to the vet. Or, just check and see if he is Ok.     So really, he is Ok, and I'm glad you care about your cat. :) That is all it takes, and some food and water! :)|`|pKZ0P3qGaa	he should be fine. he he starts limping or acting weird take him to the vet to be shure      (:|`|TPhIWWniaa	Yes, he/she is fine. Cats are very resilient.|`|2LsM4uG0aa	He's fine. I worry about you though. Are you still in school? You need some serious study of spelling. If that's not an option, try using your spell check.|`|nI8G21y8aa	i think that hell be fine. usually if cats are injured they will hide and stay away from everyone. but if hes acting normally then hes fine|`|Kg7B11ACaa	it sounds to me like he's ok..you may feel worse then the cat..as long as he's acting ok then well im glad..you may want to keep an eye on him for a while  see if he'll play or give him a treat and a hug and kiss you probably scared him more then you hurt him...good luck i hope it all works out
jyGTlpzTaa	Why would anyone make rude comments, you own the the breed of horse that is the most beautiful, majestic and versatile.<br>  <br>  19 is not so old for a horse nowadays, plenty live to 30! I would not do too much competing with him now though.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	A lot of horses live to be 30. Arabians were bred to have great health and stamina. It depends on the individual horse, obviously, but I think he'll live for at least several more years. I know two old Arabians. One if in her very late 20s and is still giving saddleseat lessons to kids. The other is a one-eyed stallion around 30. I ride him every once in a while, and he's doing great... no problems whatsoever.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS... There's no such thing as 15.8hh.
RT8LZy7gaa	I've never had a problem keeping angels and gouramis together. Angels and german rams can be a little dicey and I had an angel that attacked my male betta and won.  I had to remove the betta from the tank.    However, before getting another angel be advised that angels can be territorial towards each other.  I have two I bought at the exact same time from the same tank and the same size. Now one is bigger than the other and picks on the white one all the time.  His fins are better now but it's taken him a long time to learn how to swim away when cornered.  The black angel fish is territorial, and will chase anything, but he can't catch any of the other fish, gourami's included.  The gouramis will actually put their little feeler fins out if the angel comes towards them. The big angel just floats there most of the day looking beautiful, until he gets a certain distance from the other angel, then the chase is on.    I had two other angels before who lived together for a few years with no problems, then one day one started attacking the other.  It injured the other one's eye so I ended up selling the mean one and keeping the peaceful one.    But at no time have any of my angelfish been aggressive towards any of my other fish that weren't angels.    If your angelfish is young, make sure to get another about the same size, if not a little bigger.|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	With the size of your tank, I would not add anything else. If you really want to get more fish, get a bigger tank. Like every one has said, bigger and more mature Gouramis and Angels get very territorial. I have had a very little populated 55 gal tank and had one Angel try to claim the whole tank as his, LOL. Of course this lead to some interesting viewing. I am surprised that the Mollies haven't been beaten up yet.     But you can keep them together as long as you don't over stock the tank.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	As a general rule, no. Your tank is too small for a pair of Angels anyway.    As Angels and Gouramis mature they increase their territorial nature and battles have been fought by Gouramis & Angels, and Gouramis and other species of Gourami also. What are your non-dwarf Gouramis?    Your tank actually sounds a little over stocked and I would certainly be adding no more fish.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	They should be just fine as long as your tank is large enough. You didn't mention the size of the tank and number of fish, so please be sure you have enough room.=    With that size tank, you are overstocked. The pleco will grow up to 2 ft long in the proper tank. This tank is way too small for him. As far as adding another angel, I say no. Angels will fight unless you can get them to pair off. Most times, unless you can buy a proven pair, they most likely will fight. Especially in a tank this small.|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	Gouramis can be pretty territorial. I would watch the angelfish to make sure it's not getting nipped or chased by the gourami.
672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	as adults the normal size is 18-22 inches... however they can be anywhere from 16 to 24 inches.    Females tend to be slightly smaller than the males. they're fantastic reptiles. The dogs of the reptile world.     and they are fairly easy to care for as long as you know their dietary needs, and meet their habitat requirements.|`|FPaJ1AU0aa	As adults they get to around 2ft (including the tail!)|`|zBH33xb5aa	my female are just over 18" full grown. males get a little bigger. you can get german giants i think they are called. they get a little bigger, not sure how much. if your interested in beardies this site has a lot of good infohttp://www.beautifuldragons.503xtreme.co...|`|TpjGEguEaa	my beardie must be 300 pounds by now, he brreathes fire too.|`|I9apDK03aa	MINE IS 14" IF U KNOW WHAT I MEAN|`|QZ3eucYWaa	Yes, they usually range from 18" to 22".  There are rare reports of some ending up shorter or even larger up to 26" I think is the longest one. But, the overall average is the 18 to 22".  I love the babies! I adopted my girl last June, and she was already full grown. I hope to eventually either get more, or I would really love to get a male and breed them so I can have all those cute babies.  They are really tender and fragile as babies! I work for Petco and have taken part in trying to change the way we even care for them.   If you are debating on getting one - they do make wonderful loving pets, but be sure to do extensive research on them!!  Check out beardeddragon.org this is where I learned alot about them myself. I also made up a caresheet for them - would copy and paste here but on computer at library and not my own. You can either view my previous answers to questions on beardies as I have posted it for others, or I can email it to you - just let me know =)
tFCYaZvRaa	If you keep your cat indoors only, you never have to bathe them, they are the cleanest animal on the planet and are constantly grooming and bathing themselves.  They never get the bad smell that dogs have.  They don't require constatne attention...they sleep 14-16 hours a day and just love to be rubbed and cuddled.  You do not have to leave dinner early, get up early or plan your schedule around letting them out to potyy.  Dogs must be let out every few hours or they will go in the house.  Cats will simply use the litter box.  Mine is in the lundry room so guests do'nt see or smell it.  I use clumping litter and just scoop it out to the trash can every day.  MUCH easier to care for than dogs...I've had both and for the past 17 years I have chosen to have only cats.  Have 2 maine coons now that I recued from a shelter.  Beautiful, loving and sooo funny and sweet.  They are a little like a dogs personality casue when they are awake, they follow me wherever i go in my house.|`|MqYfsYd0aa	unlike dogs, they don't require the amount of attention a dog would need...     they clean themselves, poop in a litter box (instead of various areas in the backyard), don't need 2-3 walks a day, they entertain themselves, the list goes on!    every person is different.  some people would find a dog easier to care for, whereas myself, i much prefer the simplicity of a cat.  it's companionship with out the drooling :)|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	Cats are wonderful pets. They are low-maintenance, for the most part...you can leave them alone for the duration of the workday, and they're pleased as punch to see you when you get home. You have to make sure you play with them, though--they can get depressed!!     They do require shots. You should vaccinate them against feline leukemia and rabies, at a bare minimum. Vets have yearly booster shots for cats, just as they do for dogs. You should also consider using Frontline or Advantix, to keep fleas and ticks at bay.     As for grooming, we never really bathe our cats. You will have to brush them, if it is a long-haired cat, but if you have a short-haired cat, you don't really have to worry about grooming it, other than brushing it when it sheds in the spring/summer.     A good breed to start with is a tabby cat. My vet says (and I can vouch for it--I had a gray male that died from feline leukemia, and I miss him dearly) that gray and orange males are the most friendly kitties.     Cats are usually not fazed by other animals--we had a bunny, and our cats were actually scared of him! I've never had a dog, so I couldn't tell you what a cat will do with a dog. Our one cat tried to make friends with everything bigger than him, so I guess it really depends on your cat's temperament.|`|O2VZL8Praa	short-coated cats are a breeze!  get a boy kitten.  teach him the wonderful warmth and coziness of a friendly lap.  you're good to go for the next 20 years +/-    scoop litter daily.  change weekly.  feed twice a day.  provide fresh water.  viola!|`|pF63IMyVaa	very|`|HkAK6ZRoaa	the way a cat it's easy to care  is to clean their mess.
9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	I've had firemouths for several years, and I am very fond of them.    A 20-gallon tank is on the small side for firemouths. However, you could keep one pair in it.  It seems a shame to have just one firemouth, because their breeding behavior is wonderful to watch, and their colors are at their best when they are spawning or guarding eggs or fry.    If you have a breeding pair of firemouths in the 20, you will need another tank (preferably at least 50 gallons) for growing out the fry (unless, of course, you'd rather just let the parents eat the fry when they get tired of them).|`|NsIdp9Xmaa	Firemouth cichlids can grow to be 6-7 inches when full grown. A pair of these will need at least 30+ gallons. You would need to get a larger tank to house a pair. One could work fine if it doesn`t get territorial with other fish. Try adding larger tetra they seem to do best.
uSJPE4FQaa	Say "I will Pitch in with someone house work!" and that you'll "Keep Your room tidy" and that "I'm Growing up I will Do all i can!" My Friend shannon has two cats and two hamsters. The hamsters are in a glass like cage. The cat's won't get through and you will Do anythink For it and start earning money to buy stuff for it by your self. That is a very Good idea to do...Hope you get him!<br>  They live up two 3-4 years. And Food isn't Much.clean It once or twice a week and You will have it healthy too!|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	I dont blame your dad, there is no way I would allow a rodent in my house on purpose.  I have a standing rule, no rodents, birds, or reptiles for pets in my home, they are dirty and stink, and birds are noisy also....|`|BH9rZzWMaa	First you can tell him that hamsters live only up to 2 to 3 years.<br>  Hamsters are nocturnal and so they will not bother anyone in the day time. <br>  Hamsters only need once a week cleanings.<br>  Hamsters can eat 2 blocks of food a day. Which the blocks are fairly small. <br>  Hamsters are friendly, don't have long tails, real cute, and they only bite when they are scared. <br>  You can tell him that you won't let the hamster loose in the house. <br>  <br>  I dunno what else to say but I hope I helped a little.|`|q0rLBQo2aa	"my dad hates rodents...? how can i convince him to let me et a hamster?" <br>  Lots of people hate them, but usually without ever tasting them first. I never et a hamster, but squirrels, rabbits, woodchucks, and even (clean, lab) rats are very good if fried like chicken. NO, I'm not saying they *taste* like chicken -- that's just how you cook them. And I'm entirely serious about eating them.<br>  <br>  OK, in reply to what you actually meant: Do you take care of the cat? Totally take care of? Or just help sometimes? If not all your job, start doing so, and keep it up long enough to convince them you can be responsible. Even then, your Dad may not be reasonable about it. Fears are fears. I do reptile shows, and there's always someone who can't even stay in the room. Ditto with my spiders. The receptionist at the school where I teach can't watch *anything* on Animal Planet because they might show an ad for an upcoming show -- even a snake picture makes her lose consciousness and/or bladder control.|`|CadIYXdXaa	If you Dad is really against rodents it may be a very hard sell for you to talk him into one, but not impossible... depending on if he just doesn't like them or if he has a phobia (like some people have with snakes etc). <br>  <br>  If he has a phobia chances are he'll never agree to one. If he just doesn't like them you have a chance. <br>  <br>  Make sure you are taking really good care of your cat to show how responsible you are. Brush it, clean the litter etc, feed it. Even if someone else is currently doing any of the chores for your cat, start doing them yourself all the time.<br>  <br>  Mention to your Dad that the hamster will always stay in your room too.|`|54cb91e02a168001f4fb39668687e75baa	the girl under me is wrong. no offense to her or anything but rats are way better! i think you should get a rat instead they are real nice and friendly and their tails are so cute. rats have such a horrible reputation. hamsters are mean and they pee on you. you cant even hold them. so you should get a rat!|`|BySzZAddaa	i wanted hamster but i wasnt aloud one attall but i might be allowed gerbils because there more friendly and arent nocturnal.

It's a well known fact that practicing aggressive so called training techniques like this will encourage the dog to become even more aggressive..<br>  <br>  Go sign up for some training classes and learn how to handle your dog.

Free advice on YA is worth nothing.. You get what you pay for..|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	No, your'e not. Getting into a screaming match with your dog accomplishes nothing productive.<br>  <br>  Teach him that giving things to you is beneficial. Give him something that he will find interesting but not exciting. After he chews on it a bit tell him to drop it. If he doesn't right away, show him a really yummy treat. When he drops the object praise him and give him the treat. Practice over and over with a variety of objects.

Dogs and wolves do not knock another dog/wolf down and restrain him until he submits.

The human in the relationship has to be the pack leader or you will end up with an unhappy, out of control animal.  Quiet authority is better than screaming anytime!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Yes you are going about this right as long as you don't hit the dog. Sounds to me the dog is trying to be dominate. If i was you this is what i would do:<br>  <br>  1) If he starts being testy like that again, I would grab the dog by the collar or scruff of neck (does not hurt the dog at all)<br>  2) Place the dog on his side with his feet facing away from me.<br>  3) Put one hand on his head, the other on his back legs<br>  4) If he starts to fight I would say no<br>  5) If he gets out of my grip I would grab him again and do it over<br>  6) Once he has submitted I would let go and say good<br>  <br>  If he goes back to being testy I would do the same thing over again. Do not be fooled by the screams if he does, this is just him trying to get you to submit to him. Keep up with it, this does not hurt the dog at all, this is one of the first things taught at my obedience school and I stick by it because I have personally seen it work and have used it on my dogs and it does work.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT- Actually this does work, it does not hurt the dog. This technique teaches the dog who is dominate. Dogs do this with each other, same goes for wolves. It does not create more aggression.|`|p7swtBYzaa	First thing you need to do is stop SCREAMING at him, you are responding in anger - that just continues his aggression, really dumb thing to do.<br>  <br>  Take him for group obedience classes, that will teach you how to train him and help socialize him with other dogs and new people too.   Ask your vet for a reference to a good trainer who gives group obedience lessons.<br>  You definitely need some help with this situation - you are getting down to the dog's level at the moment, certainly not being the functioning human in charge.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, stop trying to take anything out of the dog's mouth - why would you purposely cause situations that stress the dog and cause aggression?   Avoid taking anything from him - that simple.   You don't want the dog to have it, don't give it in the first place, or leave it lying around.<br>  <br>  Use some common sense and don't make a human/dog conflict when none is needed.|`|vouUQQzBaa	By yelling you are passing on to your puppy YOUR tension.

Place it in the freezer, also they love ice cubes.|`|TpOVmqpHaa	Stop trying to train her, and stop wasting money on endless chew toys.  Puppies chew, especially when teething, and no amount of toys and training will curb it.  The only solution to keep your household from being chewed up is confinement when you can't watch her.  Rawhide chips and indestructible rubber toys, like kongs, can be given periodically throughout the day.  You don't need anything else. You can fill the kong with treats if you like, to keep her interested.  But if she has the opportunity to chew a chair leg or a sock, she'll take it.    This will eventually pass by the time she's around 2-3 yrs.  But until then save yourself some money and frustration by keeping her crated or penned when unsupervised, where she can't get to anything other than what you give her to chew.|`|fa94015ff5f0c6080fd3861b1e008e8caa	get a cloth wet and put it in the freezer for her to chew on..|`|FIxcpiA4aa	You didn't mention her breed, but some are way worse than others.

She may not be purebred|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Her hypoglycemia has nothing to do with it.  Most small pups have it & grow out of it. It is all genetics & nothing will grow hair.  Be sure to feed  a quality food. Buying from reputable breeders will ensure better quality in spite of your claim of her being a show quality.  I have heard it many times from ppl whose dogs were not close to being show quality or were registered thru the sham registries with claims of being show quality.  BYBs will tell you anything for a sale & some even put the dog in the ring when they have no chance just to claim they "show" their dogs.
P8Q39vA4aa	Thats not their original purpose but i suppose if you get the dog use to it they should be fine. It wont sink because they are equally proportionate in body.     one question do you have a big couch?    Id check out the sporting breed dogs because lots of them love water and were originally bred for it, but they do have lots of energy so like most breeds you have to do research.    Id suggest the weimaraner but you must do a lot of research on them because they are not for everyone.    Edit- no you probably wont.    One thing labs dont come in white only from poor bred stock, its a washed out color of yellow.    Only thing about sporting dogs is they dont know how to be quiet around water so they would scare off all the fish lol.    Danes arnt really the best protection dogs anymore that trait been bred out of them.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Danes are more on the chicken side than protective side.  Ppl tend to be scared of them cuz of size.  my 1st dane would hide & my 2nd at least would be on a front until they came in then she would be all over them for attention.  Most water dogs have some coat as protection.  I would suggest a flat coated retriever or chesapeake retriever.  They would be far better than most labs right now due to overbreeding.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	From what I know, Danes CAN swim, but they aren't really Portuguese Water Dogs, if you know what I mean.     I'd suggest dogs that are made for water, Labrador Retrievers, Curly Coated Retrievers, Portuguese Water Dogs, Poodles, Black Mouth Cur, Vizsla, Pointers, and Weimaraners.|`|DV61eR5iaa	Get a dog that will protect you and is big, nut fun to play with. I suggest eethier a Golden Retriever or a Black Lab. The Retriever is a good fetcher, easy to train and easy to build a strong relationship with. Labs or harder to train and like bitting alot, but once you pas that stage he is a good guard dog and will always protect you.|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	Labradors are excellent water dogs, they will head for the nearest body of water. In fact most of the retriever type dogs love water. I am not sure about danes though, I have never even considered getting one as they don't live very long and are susceptible to certain conditions (like bloat) simply because of their size.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	As far as I know Great Danes are not overly fond of the water. Any dog will play in the water if properly introduced to it, but if you want a dog that truly LOVES the water get a Labrador Retriever.  FYI - They don't come in "white", "charcoal", "silver", or "red".  These are terms used by byb's and puppymills to get more money for a substandard dog.  They come in black, yellow (ranging from very light to very dark), chocolate.  A white or red looking Lab is simply on the very far end of the yellow spectrum but is still a yellow Lab and nothing 'rare'.     They are loyal, very friendly and non-aggressive.  They can be trained to bark at strangers or people you are worried about but they'll never attack.|`|D7Wh8mOJaa	A big back yard is nice, however, they live in the house and make great apartment dogs as well.  A Great Dane is a companion dog.      Great Danes are not exactly thrilled with water sports, however some can be. If you are looking for companionship at the lake, they are fine. Most are just fine hanging out on the beach and running around in the water up to about belly deep.  All of mine will play in the ocean and lakes.  None will jump in a pool and go for a swim.  I have known others that would swim in the pool or swim out for a ball, but that is rare.  Also have a couple that will attack sprinklers to play in.  All hate getting a bath.    They are not the traditional idea of a watch dog.  Most, if not all, respectable breeders will not home a puppy that is to be trained in that manner.  That said, their size is a deterent and most Great Danes will defend the people they own with their life if need be.  It would be very foolish to come into our home uninvited.  On the other hand if you are invited you will be greeted with an incredible amount of affection.      I would recommend the book: "The Great Dane, Model of Nobility" by Jill Swedlow.  The book is currently out of print, however Jill offers it as a free download from her website.  Just google it.  Amazon had several copies available last week.    When you are ready for a puppy, please be sure to contact your local Dane club or the Great Dane Club of America for a breeder referal.  Support ethical breeders.    Good luck  j
SzW9GmRsaa	Actually, Clydesdales were never bred to be ridden - the stature they have is from generations of breeding to pull.  They are immensely strong, but as pulling animals, not as riding animals.  The vast majority of Clydesdales do not have good quality dense cannon bones - their bone tends to be porous and as a result is not as strong.  Your average Highland or Dales pony is a stronger weight carrier than a Clydesdale, and neither one (if fit and healthy) would have a problem with a boyfriend of 13 stone ;)    Heavy horses can jump in theory, but it's far more difficult for them than a slighter horse.  If a horse has been bred to pull it will naturally be a bit down in front and want to lean on its forehand.  It's difficult to get anything on its forehand to jump, but when you add the bulk weight of a 16.3 horse it gets a lot more difficult... especially since the bone is porous!  A horse needs strength in all four legs to jump; you need the hinds to push you up and forwards, and the fores take the weight on landing.  Throw in some not particularly strong or dense cannon bones, and you've not got a whole lot to land on.    Many Clydesdales are ridden (and occasionally jumped) happily and never encounter any problems - but don't believe that just because it's big it is necessarily a strong weight carrier!|`|JXJvxhZPaa	A Clydesdale could do some jumping, but if you want to jump frequently you should consider a lighter horse.  With the 20% rule, your boyfriend should be able to ride most any horse over 15 hands or so.|`|uwrzB6Kzaa	its hard to say exactly what weight each horse can carry.    but i have a 14.3hh haflinger and he carries my 12 stone husband so easy.    your boyfriend being 13 stone isnt heavy for most horses. i would let him ride my 15.2hh tb x standard bred as horses can carry alot more than you think.    and jumping all depends on the horse really. i know some people with heavy horses and they wont jump at all but then i know some other people with heavy horses who love jumping and will jump up to around 3ft.|`|f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	As with most healthy horse, 1/5 is the general rule for of horse weight to carry , Add tack and rider.    1700 (small) /5 = 340 pounds = 24 stone  Both could ride at the same time, but becareful... it is a long ways down to the ground.    They can jump, or more likely step over.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s5FHwyhF...|`|sbB0TpGXaa	Not jumping your clydesdale can carry 30% of their body weight for short periods and 25% for light riding.  For jumping use the 20% rule.      At 16.3 hands the horse will weight between 1800 and 2000 pounds so it can easily carry the both of you together.    The 20% rule that everyone is quoting was made for sport horses in competition.  An 1800 lb horse jumping even a short jump will put far more pressure on it than 20% of its weight.    And yes clydesdales can jump.|`|bVLwH4jlaa	Sorry, there are no actual hard and fast answers to this question.    I have seen a Shire stallion clear a six foot hedge in pursuit of an eager mare. I have also seen a TB champion show jumper prove that he had had enough and refused to do more than ground poles; ended up he loved dressage.    My point is please get the prejudice out of your head and see what he can do as an individual.|`|ihyM9j8laa	yes he can, can i just say there are lots  of heavier people riding even smaller horses so don't panic hun, some one can be 6-7-8 stone and ride very heavy and visa versa. look up a horse called NED KELLY he was a fantastic show jumper in his day, lovely Big horse. x|`|2f4Nvp79aa	65 pounds|`|VmZKZjP1aa	There's no hard/fast rule on how much they can carry. In your case, she will be ok carrying him. Generally you would go with 20% body weight of the horse. So if he weighs 1000 lbs. a rider could weigh 200lbs tack and rider combined.     Here's a helpful article on how much horses can carry    http://ezinearticles.com/?How-Much-Weigh...|`|8XPtXrklaa	a sturdy clydesale would definetly be able to carry 13 stone - they were used for ploughing fields and carrying heavy loads so that isn't all too much.  Clydesdale's can jump too, not as atheletic but they can still go round courses, in fact some cobs are excellent jumpers (I know she's not a cob lol but their still heavyweight)|`|j2yLjm6Naa	A horse can normally carry 20% of his or her body weight, so this mare should be able to hold you and your boyfriend|`|yQFdBj3haa	They can carry a fair bit of weight being draft horses so yes she would be able to carry him easily.     Yes there is no reason you can't jump her.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	The weight of you and your boyfriend should not be an issue under any circumstance with the size of the mare.  On light work ( flat, walking some trotting) she could easily handle 35% of her weight including tack.  When jumping it would go down to about 20% depending on her build etc. which still isn't a problem.    Clydesdales are more adapt than people give them credit for.  While they are known for driving, plowing, etc., they make wonderful saddle horses too.    When you work a clydesdale and get them balanced and light, they do wonderful in dressage and some eventing. (They have the stamina).  They can be decent hunter/jumpers too depending on the mind and the conformation of the horse.  Unlike some other horses, the clydesdale will only exert as much energy as needed to clear the fence.  Setup of the horse is always important, but with a clydesdale, because of the height and the short back, you want a little longer spot so as not to look like you are chipping the fences.  This also depends on how the horse was taught to jump and if they really enjoy it.  Some horses, clydesdales included, just don't like to jump.    My mare loves dressage and being a pack-mare for all the kids :)  we put several on her at a time with my grandson at the reins and they are safes as can be since the clydesdale is a gentle soul.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	I understand that a horse can carry its about a third of its own body weight.  It depends too on the fitness of the horse and the rider, some riders can ride light because of good balance and are not heavy in the seat.  I should think your Clydesdale would carry your boyfriend - if he is willing!    I should think they can jump - maybe not to Olympic standard but really I would not try it.  They could probably hop out over a fence where the grass is greener, or to visit a mare or stallion but I really think she would be too heavy to do much more.    I know Ryan's Son was three quarter shire.    PS, I hope you have long legs!  I am only 5'1 and shrinking.  I could never ride anything wide!|`|KnGJtViZaa	Yes it should be, i am 5.3foot and 9 stone and i ride a 14,1 pure newforest gelding, and he carries me fine,         hope this helped x|`|HN4XLSHIaa	it depends on the size of the horse to how much weight   the size you hav given tho will easily take his weight     but if your interetsed in jumping it might be worth looking at gypsy cobs instead   ( as you can get to olympic standard on some cobs )   or irish draught would be good !   good luck and i hope u find the horse your looking for
WbRuTjmFaa	Some bettas recover some do not. I had one special girl I hand fed peas to pretty much ever other day, She got better but within a week would be getting wierd again  You could actually hear and feel her smacking the mushed peas from my finger.. I loved that fish.. something.. .. wow    Anyway try the salt and elevated temp and prepare yourself to lose her.  I do not recommend killing them, it is wrong to flush a live fish or freeze it and I tried the clove oil as was recommended and found it extremely cruel as well.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	sorry to hear that I read up on this and my book says "the disease may be slowed through the use of antibiotics and methyl blue they suggest that diseased fishes be killed" sorry I could not be better help.    17 years experience with fish|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	Are you shure he has swim bladder disease or is your betta just lazy or depressed|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Try upping the temp to about 80-82 degrees and add some aquarium salt, both wil help to relieve stress and fight off any infections.  There are some meds out there that can help, not many though.  The pea is really the best thing, but you can't make him eat :(      I suggest not feeding him anything else and keep offering th peas though, along with the elevated temp and salt.  Best of luck!|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	I am sorry to hear this. I have watched fish die from this. It is the best for the betta to put it out of its misery. I have talked to fish store keepers, other owners, and vets, so far there is nothing that can cure it. Just but it in a plastic bag , with water, and put it in the freezer. Once again, sorry.|`|OsVswissaa	swim bladder problems are usually a symptom of other things, it could be constipation which a pea would have help with.  it doesn't sound like that's it.  If your fish wont eat, it might be too far gone to help him now.  Sorry.|`|wsbp0nuzaa	you can't do anything about it man except watch your little fish die slowly. because you should of told a vet before not after several days.|`|GEV367kiaa	He won't live long, anyway.

b90e42d25bd45025e46d388ab0c06d12aa	My suggestion would be a bearded dragon or corn snake.  You're going to need to clean up after any animal you get, and I find these guys to be much more affordable then the dog we have.  With snakes you only have to feed once a week and spot clean there tanks after they go to the bathroom, also you can feed them frozen mice instead of real ones that only coast about $2 for one instead of $40 for a bag of dog food.  Bearded dragons are the same you'll have to spot clean their cages but food coast (crickets and greens) are much more affordable.  With a cat you'll have to clean the litter box every day and feed it twice a day and that can get expensive, the same thing with a dog you'll have to clean your yard every day buy him toys and take him for walks.  If you do decide to get a dog or a cat please check out your local shelter there are many pets that are in need of a good home.  Good luck with the new addition to your family.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I would say a puggle or anther type of medium size short haired dog|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Did you know that goldfish can live 20-25 years at least when taken care of properly?<br>  <br>  I don't like making recommendations when I know nothing about you.

If you like big dogs, get a german sheperd, because because they're very loyal and protect you in your time of need. (I'm a owner ;-) )|`|rQlzfHqraa	Get some egg laying chickens.

c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	This is not needed at all if you're feeding Crested Gecko Diet.  They get all the calcium and vitamins they need from that food.  If I do dust crickets, it's with PURE calcium, not one with D3.  Too much D3 is bad and can mess up calcium absorption.    If you aren't going to feed CGD, then you need to use both pure calcium and a vitamin with D3 mixed in your baby food as well as pure calcium dusted crickets 3x per week.|`|3IUMh4Igaa	No you are good with that, but I would get crested gecko dust from T-Rex. You mix it with water and it makes a really good fruit and vitamin supplement. Also, make sure you get them eating their fruits and nectar's.|`|7ZsMMkp5aa	I think that it is really important that you have that vitamin D3 because they do not have any lighting. I would buy the multivitamin as well just to be safe. Instead of dusting the crickets, you could just put you could put the stuff in a lid and the cresties will lick it right out. Isn't that awsome?!

283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	you need to contact the cats protection and you should report that woman. I have 15 rescue cats and I also foster cats and kittens for my local shelter. I also work at the shelter. Foster kits are kept separate from my own cats for the sake of the fosters and my furbabies. Cats are vertical dwellers so yes they may get up on stuff but that is no reason that the cat should have been in that condition and unhealthy. I also have a house large enough to comfortably accommodate my 15 but 30 permanent or semi-permanent kits is too many even for me. Any time that the animal is suffering, dirty, unsocialized, or is not getting adequate care then that is too many, whether it is 2 cats or 30 cats. There is not a magic number but the quality of care in that foster home sounds abyssmal.<br>  <br>  I do not think you will get in trouble if you call and explain the situation and you may even help the remaining kits. As for your kit, have you tried taking it to a professional groomer or had it groomed at the vets? It may have stuff in it's fur from being in that place and that is what your daughter is sneezing about. A change in diet would be great too, look for a good quality grain free food. There is much less dander and dry skin when the diet is grain free. Keep the cat combed and that will also help. Long haired cats do need to be combed as a brush will not get out all of the undercoat hairs that have already been shed and are trapped.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	You need to call the rescue and tell them about the conditions there.  If they won't do anything, you'll need to go higher and report it to the RSPCA or local law enforcement.  Since you signed the agreement the cat would have to go back not necessarily to that particular home but to the rescue who will find housing for it.|`|QC6oBb2iaa	Yes, you signed a legally-binding document.  If you need to give her up, unfortunately, you must take her back to the same place.|`|tJkCPbcaaa	give your daughter claritin on a daily basis and this should help the allergy that she has to the cat...try it...it would be worth it if it works and you could keep the cat|`|ree7wp74aa	hi i dont think they would ever check up if they did just say she died off ill health from them and that u are going to report them, i would go to the cats protection if u can i have heard that if the rspca cant rehome them they put them to sleep after a certain time period, dont know how true that is but cp can never put a health cat to sleep. worth checking with them, and be aware they both have waiting lists, u could try some antihistermines for your daughter in the mean time and keep the cat well brushed to keep the hair and dander at bay, good luck|`|entB7tPQaa	Report the woman for abuse, because she is hoarding animals in an unhealthy environment. The cats will all be removed. If your daughter is allergic 1. You should have known before hand 2. See the doctor and have him perscribe something for her allegies. <br>  I'm glad you care about the cat's future though. =]|`|4TX26viFaa	They do check, so the cat would have to be returned there, HOWEVER phone your animal shelter and ask, describing the conditions and the address and person's name to them so they can make a health call over there.  Do this before you would need to return the cat, so they can close down the place if it's that bad.
cVxfh6thaa	well birds don't adapt to change in a little while and this wierd behaivior can last for as long as some 5 years...o and don't try to tame the love bird for they will get more aggresive.lovebirds can only be tamed as babies......it's very rare that you can tame an older bird...p.s. don't by other diffrent birds because they will fight.
q0rLBQo2aa	Pets deserve more commitment and better care than such a vague question and such inexpert answers as you will get on this site. <br>  How much do you know about breeding? How old was she" Was it a bigger, older experienced male? Very likely the rough sex tore her innards, but I HATE diagnosing from a description. <br>  <br>  If you are a responsible and decent person you will do one of two things IMMEDIATELY: A)humanely kill her, or B)rush her to the vet, knowing the vet bill will be many times the cash value of the animal. <br>  Animals are not toys. <br>  <br>  Pets have no *right* to humane treatment because they are not human. BUT we have an obligation not to be cruel or neglectful, because as human beings we know better and have a moral duty to act in accordance with that knowledge. That's why it's called "humane" treatment. If you're not humane, you're not fully human.|`|VWybtG9Kaa	You bred her, and had no idea what to do if something went wrong??? Get of your computer, put her in a warm box and <br>  <br>  TAKE HER TO THE VET ASAP.|`|fYPhlnPcaa	probably dying, you need to take her to the doctor.

It's too early for her to have had a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  Do you even know how old she was? How much smaller was she than the male?<br>  <br>  Without seeing her condition myself, I can't make an accurate diagnosis, but it doesn't sound like she's going to make it. If you take her to the vet, she's probably going to die anyway, and they'll charge you an arm and a leg to tell you that.<br>  <br>  It's sad, and I'm very sorry. If you decide to try to breed again in the future, please do quite a bit of research before hand.|`|TcJVVurzaa	Ask a vet. I think that that happens sometimes, idk but the bleeding was because the male f#4@ked the female.|`|QE5kSJAAaa	You probably just killed her.|`|7emJ77lFaa	it means when a guinea pig moves around to much they get really tired and they stay motionless for days
Eyawiwc5aa	If temps aren't right it could affect eating or not eating plus also if the temps aren't right the food will not digest right.  Temps:  never let drop below 70F ...  basking 92-96F if temp is too low digestion is slowed too high food digests too fast and nutrition is lost  medium/middle (overall) 88-92F  cool 75-84F  at night 73-84F ... having a temp gun works the best to know what your igs body temp truly is.  *** NO HEAT ROCKS PLEASE ... they can cause major burns on the under belly  Depending on how long you've had your ig he/she may not eat for a few days. You may want to try feeding more often offering 30mins-1hr after lights turn on, in the afternoon, between 3-5pm, and then like 30mins before lights turn off. Sometimes the young igs will eat when us humans aren't around.  Also try different sizes of greens, cut into small bites, chop/food process almost into a slush form.  Also try instead of using a bowl, use a plastic lid.  Food:  Daily food should have 5-7 good staple greens (2-3 cups a day if not more younger igs may eat less then 1/4 cup) ... collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, dandelion greens (if you can find), endive, radicchio, arugula, mache (if you can find), watercress ... some greens to give occasionally kale, bok choy, escarole ... adding basil for young igs sometimes helps them eat ... romaine is mostly water no nutrience, you can add small amount and occasionally in w/ the good staple greens (collard, mustard, etc) but do not make romaine just your iguanas choice of greens (or any other type of lettuce most of us humans eat) ... some things to add (small amounts) snap peas, bell peppers (every now and then), parsnip, sweet potato/yam, acorn squash, butternut squash, buttercup squash ... fruits should only be given every now and then once or twice a week type of thing fruits are like junk food to iguanas ... some fruits to try papay, kiwi, mango, raspberries, strawberries, grapes, honeydew (great water source), canalope (great water source), 12 grain wheat bread ... if anything has seeds make sure you remove seed before you give it to your iguana anything w/ small seeds like strawberries wait like 3 days before giving anymore ... watermelon (seedless) can be frozen and then shaved onto your iguanas food helps w/ hydration everyday ... there are some foods that aren't good for your iguana: spinach has oxalate acids bind to the calcium, so even though spinach is high in calcium, almost none is actually available for the iguana to use, also the oxalate acids can form oxalate crystals which can and do build up in the kidneys causing kidney damage/failure ... some ig owners do give there ig spinach but in very small amounts and only once a month ... corn igs can not digest ... carrots can block calcium absorption ... bananas are low in calcium best to give another type of fruit ... apples too much acid - appetite suppressant ... rhubarb is poisonous ... food should be cut/chopped/diced no bigger then the iguanas head, if they are small having a chopper chop them up, or slice them into very small pieces ... spray/mist food to help w/ water/hydration  Animal protein:  Iguanas are plant eaters, they should not be feed any animal protein. No meat/bugs, no dairy. If you ever give your ig iguana diet dried food, please read the ingredients there are so many products on the market today that clearly puts meat protein in there ingredients, usually w/ in the first 10 ingredients. Some that I am aware of that do MonsterDiet, TRex, Zilla, Wardley. RepCal Iguana pellets is one that is safe to use. Soak pellets before offering to help w/ hydration, only give a few pellets for you want the greens to be main diet.

It's extremely difficult to create humidity in a properly ventilated tank, so it's good to let him frolic in a tub regularly.  The water should be warm, but not hot.    The tank should also have a UV light AND a heat lamp where they can bask.  Do not use a heat rock.    As far as food goes, I fed mine a steady diet of uncooked kale, parsnips, and butternut squash (not necessarily at the same time).  Stay away from spinach and not too much lettuce.  It's ok if they have lettuce every now and then, but there is no nutritional value.    Iguanas are fantastic pets but require a lot of maintenance and a complex habitat.    I would suggest checking the Green Iguana Society web site as well
DhiwcfVbaa	if you feed some other food high in fibre, low in water,  should be ok, like straw, grass, even celery is high in fibre. if the rabbit is used to having a lot everyday then it is important, just the sudden change in diet can cause stomach/intestinal problems, like diarrhoea. that is very serious, my bunny died from that! :( they can die from it within hours as well, but as long as there is no diarrhoea, should be ok. if it normally eats just a small amount I wouldn't worry. I did have one bunny who never ever ate hay, i always made sure he had some, so if he wanted it he could, but he never ate it! i tried all different kinds, wasn't interested.|`|u61yKsE3aa	Do you feed your rabbit more than just hay.  If you also feed pellets and fresh fruits and veggies they can go a few weeks with out hay.  If hay if their only food source I would tell you to start supplementing their diet.  But a rabbit should be fed daily.  After as little as 24 hours with no food their organs can start to shut down this will lead to lots of problems rabbits have very high metabolism which is why it is recommended to always have a food and water source available also make sure he is warm.|`|5M57TTfpaa	Your rabbit will be fine without hay as long as she has her pellets and water still.|`|4MA9yNPVaa	Give it some fresh veggies, make sure you have pellets and fresh water in the cage. It should be ok for a couple of days at least until the storm passes.
e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	Both should have a 20 or 30 gallon tank as adults.    Ball pythons are nice snakes, but are notoriously picky eaters, and are somewhat sensitive to humidity levels.  I don't really recommend them for beginners.    Milk snakes are easy to care for, and are beautiful snakes.  They don't get too large, but in my experience they are feisty little things.  With regular handling they should mellow out.  They do fine in lower humidity, and I don't think I've ever had one refuse a meal.    Honestly, my favorite snakes for beginners are sand boas or rosy boas.  They are hardy, unique, fairly easy to care for, and they don't get that big.  Males get around 18 inches and would do fine in a 10 gallon tank, and females get 2-3 feet and would do best in a 20 or 30.  They are great and beautiful snakes, and fairly inexpensive.  I don't know why people always push the balls and corns and overlook these little guys.|`|Du551NlKaa	Ball python Adults generally do not grow to more than 90-120 cm (3-4 feet) in length,[2] although some specimens have reached 152 cm and even 182 cm (5-6 feet), but this is very rare. [4] Females tend to be slightly bigger than males maturing at an average of 4, 4.5 feet. Males usually average around 3, 3.5 feet. [5]The build is stocky[2] while the head is relatively small. The scales are smooth[4] and both sexes have anal spurs on either side of the vent, although males have larger spurs.[6]    The color pattern is typically black with light brown-green side and dorsal blotches. The belly is a white or cream that may or may not include scattered black markings.[4] However, those in the pet industries have, through selective breeding, developed many morphs: genetic mutations with altered colors and patterns.[7]      [edit] Common names  Royal python, ball python.[2]    The name ball python refers to the animal's tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened.[8] The name royal python (from the Latin "regius") is based in part on the story that Cleopatra supposedly wore the snake around her wrist.      [edit] Geographic range  Found in Africa from Senegal, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin, Niger and Nigeria through Cameroon, Chad and the Central African Republic to Sudan and Uganda. No type locality was given in the original description.[1]      [edit] Habitat  Prefers grasslands, savannahs and sparsely wooded areas.[2]      [edit] Behavior  This terrestrial species is known for its defense strategy that involves coiling into a tight ball when threatened, with its head and neck tucked away in the middle. In this state, it can literally be rolled around. Favored retreats include mammal burrows and other underground hiding places where they also. aestivate.[2]      [edit] Feeding  In the wild, the diet consists mostly of small mammals, such as African soft-furred rats, shrews and striped mice. Younger individuals have also been known to feed on birds. Captives usually do well on domestic rats and mice, either live, pre-killed, or frozen-thawed.[4] The size of the prey item should be equivalent to or slightly larger than the width of the largest part of their body. This python is known for being a picky eater and may not eat for months. While this is not odd, care should be taken to watch that the snake does not experience significant weight loss. [9]      [edit] Reproduction  Oviparous, with anywhere from 3-11 rather large eggs being laid (4-6 being most common).[4] These are incubated by the female underground and hatch after 90 days.[2] Sexual maturity is reached at 12-18 months for males, 24-36 months for females. Age is only one factor in determining sexual maturity and ability to breed -- weight is the second factor. Males should be no less than 900g (2.0 lbs.) to breed, and females should be no less than 1500 g (3.3 lbs.).[4]      [edit] Captivity  Due to their smaller size compared to other pythons and commonly docile temperament, these snakes are bred in captivity and have become popular as pets.[10] Juveniles tend to be more aggressive at first, but typically calm down as they get used to human contact. Wild-caught specimens have greater difficulty adapting to a captive environment, which can result in refusal to feed and parasitic infection. Longevity is 20-40 years, with the oldest captive specimen on record reaching 48 years of age|`|tkqGwbtHaa	ball pythons are relatively easy to care for. its like having fish though, they pretty much just look cool and decorate the room, the only difference is you can hold them. they don't do very much. and feeding them can be gruesome.   all snakes get infections and parasites quite easily, so are you willing to take him to an exotic vet or give him shots?  aside from that, the tank size depends on you budget and how big your snake is. i own a  4 ft ball python and he resides in a 40 gallon tank. you have to have a lid that clamps down because they can and will escape. you also need to watch the temperature and humidity, you can buy gauges at any pet store. a ball python's temp should roughly be around 80 degrees and the humidity should be 30-50.   for substrate you can use a number of things, i have used recycled newspaper pellets often.  make sure he has a large enough water dish for him to soak in, he will do this often especially when he needs to shed.  heaters, you will want one that sits on top of the tank (or two depending on how big it is) and one that sticks to the bottom of the tank. you will also need a timer for the lamps so they shut off after 12 hrs.  avoid using a heat rock, they can burn themselves on it.  and lastly you will want something in there he can hide in, like a carved out log. you can get all of these at a pet store.      good luck on choosing your new pet, hope this helped!          *EDIT* oh yes, one more thing.. you will want a separate smaller tank to feed him in, you should NEVER feed him in its own tank, or he will think that every thing that goes in there is food, including your hands.|`|eSoU2C3Waa	King or Milk snakes are so much better then ball pythons because they don't need to eat big rays or rabbits, and they're cheaper.  keep in mind that ball pythons are PYTHONS and they can be unperdictable.|`|PIwP8DFxaa	I have a 6 year old 3 ft ball python and I love him. I keep him in a 32.5 gallon vivarium. I use 2 heating lamps and sponges for humidity. They are very docile and easy to care for. One way that you can make sure you don't get a picky eater, tell the owner of 1 you are considering to feed the ball before you buy it.
KvUJZa1Paa	Well other then you I am probably the only person looking at this question, that knows where Clarion Pa is. I Know you have a phone book and that your area isn't out in boondocks. so look in phone book under vets and I am sure you will find one<br>  Good Luck
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	This is really down to what equipment you have as it sounds as though you're not to experienced.    Any fish, including guppies, needs a heated, filtered tank that has completed the nitrogen cycle, do you have this? The cycle takes 2-6 weeks to complete.    Angelfish are a terrible idea, they get around 12" and need at least a 30-35 gallon tank that is at least 18" tall, fully cycled, heated and filtered again.    Instead of experimenting on captive animals, do something based on different water chemistries and how they support life instead. If you must use critters, use something like brine shrimp instead.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	What are you doing?  Exactly?  This will determine not only what fish is best, but also what fish you CAN have.  If it's an unfiltered, un-airated tank, you are stuck with goldfish and betta as they are the only one capable of retrieving their own air with out relying on their gills.  If it's a small tank with filter, heater and whatnot, than guppies are a good idea.  Small, cheap and pretty they will breed like crazy as well.  They can range from a quarter for a feeder guppy (resilient and hardy but not pretty, watch for infections and parasites as feeders aren't all that well cared for) to any were from 2-5$ depending on the sex and type.  Girls are cheaper but often less pretty.  Males are prettier but you have to take care that their long fins aren't damaged with sharp ornaments or too powerful a filter.  However, this all relys on the tank size and what accomodations you have for it.  Also, you mentioned tap water?  This is not acceptable for any fish without a water conditioner.  Chemicals palced in our water that are often good for us are bad for the fish.  The conditioner removes these and is required for all fish, from goldfish to angelfish.  You risk shock and a horrible death without it.  Hope this helps, best of luck!|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	The fact that you are asking this question leads me to believe you have no clue how to take care of an aquarium. That leads me to believe that the fish will be harmed in one way or another.    Aside from that, guppies are a very easy fish to care for. Get males they have more color.=|`|ktVkRc3Raa	An Angel Fish is a great idea for a biology project. They have a beautiful dorsal fin and come in many shapes and sizes. They cost about 15 to 20 dollars.    Another type of fish that you could do is Guppies. They are soooooooooo cool. They are neon in color and can have a lot of babies so be careful if you are buying more than one. These fish cost about 13 maybe 15 dollars.    Good luck on your project! I hope you both get an A+|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	Guppies or mollies|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Type of fish depends on what sort of set up you can afford.|`|mQKDlJRWaa	guppies would work well as long as you have a live plant to filter the water. They are fairly cheap, about 1 dollar each. We used them for a biology experiment once too and with the plants they did very well.
zteJIXdmaa	it is that you are over feeding them|`|Zp5upGraaa	You might not even have to be using any chemicals, if the tank gets cloudy from the new filter you might not be cleaning  the tank well enough or you may have a bad filter.  Also when you clean the tank you could try using vinegar instead of using a cleaning chemical.|`|OlgVhCwiaa	The same thing happened to me. When i first got my tank the water seemed very cloudy. I changed the water often and it didn't seem to stay clear so i bought a new filter and i reason later that it wasn't only the filter. It was the way i was cleaning the tank. If you have gravel your best bet it to clean that because food tends to get rot down there also. Hope I helped.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	You over cleaned, effectively messing up the bacteria and water chemistry.    The ONLY chemical you should ever need for a healthy tank is dechlorinator. Salt will harm your pleco in the long term especially.    Replacing filter media effectively destroyed all the good established bacteria that was keeping you water chemistry stable. You need to test your water, any sign of ammonia you're going to have to do daily partial water changes to stop it poisoning the fish.    FYI Balas should be in a 6ft tanks and Plecos don't really clean, what ever they eat comes out the other end two fold, they are very messy animals.|`|SOuezSW2aa	cause of the condensation|`|ktVkRc3Raa	Because of all of the pets in the tank their poop is what is making the water cloudy. My tank did the same thing because we didn't was it in a while but then when we did wash it the next day it was dirty again because of all the pets in the tank and their poop that comes out of them.     Sorry to be so gross with the poop and everything.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	My bet is that you have overcleaned, and you are overstocked. The Pleco and bala need a much larger tank. Both of these fish will grow to about 1-2 ft. If kept in this tank, they may stay small, but their internal organs will continue to try to grow and develop. This will cause them to live a much shorter life. It will also be very painful.    Because of the overcrowding, you probably have high levels of ammonia. You should be changing 30% of the water weekly with a gravel vac. (15-20% if you were not overstocked.)     As far as feeding, you should only feed what your fish will eat within 3 minutes twice a day. The only chemicals you should be adding to your water is the water conditioner to remove chlorine/chloramine.=|`|kwOFstbKaa	This is a bacteria bloom... Ok firstly you need to read up on aquarium cycling on the net but here are the basics:  Fish do their business in the water releasing nasty ammonia into the water which makes it like swimming in bleach for them.  A good bacteria naturally builds up in a tank to eat this ammonia and turn it into nitrite.  This nitrite isnt good for fish either.. but another naturally occuring bacteria will also grow that eats the nitrite and turns that into nitrate which is only harmful in large quantities and regular partial water removal and replacement keeps this under control.    A successful fish keeper not only has to look after their fish but also this bacteria that the fish need to survive.    A few golden rules in keeping this bacteria were broken, therefore ammonia built up and the white cloudy water you see is now the result of a large amount of the bacteria not normally visible, coming back in large numbers to deal with the ammonia.    The mistakes made were as follows:  -Fish numbers should be increased slowly over weeks so as not to increase ammonia too much that the bacteria cannot populate itself to keep up with demand.  -Cleaning real well.. bacteria lives on all surfaces, scrubbing everything in the tank at the same time has destroyed some of that bacteria  -Rinsing the filter... bacteria cannot survive in untreated tap water and exposed to air, these should be rinsed gently in your usual treated aquarium water  -Overfeeding can increase ammonia levels when uneaten food begins to break down.  -Only ever replace 10% when doing water changes  -Too many fish or too large for the tank can build up too much ammonia that isn't well enough diluted or catered for by the bacteria.  Your tank does need to be bigger for these fish the minute they start to grow.  These fish (except the mollies) can grow rather large    Chemicals to reduce cloudiness only tend to mask the problem and they tend to work only by binding small particles of dirt that normally pass through the filter so that they actually get caught by the filter.    What you need to do is you need to do is a 40% water change due to ammonia levels then 10% daily until conditions begin to improve.  I would suggest buying a water test kit for ammonia nitrite and nitrate as a minimum.  Ammonia and nitrite should be 0ppm, none should be present at all because it is harmful to fish, nitrate should be kept below 20ppm with frequent water changes.    Unfortunately there will be ammonia and nitrite in your tank if you have a bacteria bloom but the water changes should help ease their lives a little.  Be warned though, your fish are not in good conditions whilst this cycling stage is going through.  You will be lucky if you do not lose at least one fish, we have all been there when we started out.  Watch out for crazy swimming behaviour from your fish and reddening of the gills and do a 40-50% emergency water change when you see this.    Keeping the water even more aearated than usual with an extra pump or venturi is also advisable right now, this will be a great help to ensuring their survival.    Good luck and happy fish keeping.|`|OsVswissaa	The most common cause is a harmless bacterial or algae bloom, although if it was algae it would probably be green.  If the fish are acting fine and your tests come out normal, then just wait it out and let it sort itself out.  If you always used a product in the past the tank never had a chance to stabilize on it's own before.|`|zzRaEOawaa	Thant happened 2 me to my fish died so do this fast. Do a 50% water change and not to many chemical just the water clearer. Then check the ammonia your fish might be sick also. Really, check the ammonia, that is a big thing. If the ammonia is high then get some heavy duty ammonia detox. Hope I helped. I hope your fish get better! also maybe contact a vet. That may help.
Iw6vqJd8aa	I always found angels very easy to care for. I even had them mate. I did nothing really special, did a weekly partial water change, fed the fish flakes, couple times a month frozen brine shrimp. I had plastic broad leaf and narrow leaf plants with pieces of slate for them to lay their eggs on. the key was make their tank as life like as possible and stress free and you'll have no problems. I also kept plecos in the same tank and had no problems with fin nipping. Actually the opposite happened, the angels nipped at the pleco! LOL     You could even keep another angel or two in that tank.|`|T6yYgMIUaa	Angelfish are so very easy to care for! They do NOT need to be separated by sex unless you do NOT want to have fry. They also do NOT need special food, mine eat flakes 3 times a day and frozen brine shrimp twice a month. Fighting isn't an issue until they start to pair off and if you only have two that won't be an issue anyway. Two angelfish will be perfectly happy in a 29 gallon tank. I have more than that in my 29 gallon. It is a bare bottom tank with a sword and a crinum calamistratum and a few pieces of slate to lay eggs on when they are mature enough.|`|ktVkRc3Raa	Yes Angelfish are easy to take care of.     You may keep two of them in the same tank but be sure that they are the same sex and they do not mate each other unless you want them to mate.    No the Dwarf Rubber Lip Pleco can not live in the same tank.|`|1jAZfpODaa	1. They are considered moderate care level. If you do weekly water changes and give them a large variety diet then they are easy to take care of.  2. Yes. Angelfish grow to the capacity of their tank. 29 gallons is a decent size.  3. Plecos are known to be aggressive so it is at your own risk. Delicate fish such as angelfish can have their fins nipped. A dwarf variety is probably okay though.|`|wsbp0nuzaa	1. no because they usually need special food.  2. if they are the same gender.  3. no because they will fight.
IrdZKYT3aa	It's normal to have cloudy water after a water change, to a point.  This is over week, so somethings wrong.  Have you tried and water clairifiers?  These take the small particulate, basically silt and dust, that's in the water and clump it together.  Right now the particles may be to fine and small for your filter to grab on to, a water clairifier makes them "stick" together so that the filter can grab and hold them as it filters.  Hope this helps! Best of Luck!|`|qG752H8Qaa	maybe one of your fish is sick or maybe the glass is dirty and not the water|`|JVMw3Ivdaa	Is your filter still working properly?  Perhaps there's something different about your water. (e.g., harder/softer than usual, chemical imbalance if it's city water, pH is off wack, etc)  That's really all I can think of, sorry! -_-|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	You say you have a few guppies. With 2 cory cats and 2 ghost glass catfish, you should have no more than 3 guppies or you are overcrowded. Have the water tested for ammonia, nitrite and nitrate.     You don't mention how you do the water changes, so I will explain the basics. Change 15-20% of the water weekly using a gravel vac. Do not change the filter at the same time as the water change.     Also, be sure not to overfeed. Feed no more than your fish will eat within 2-3 minutes.    Cloudy water is usually caused by overfeeding, overcrowding, or high ammonia levels and poor water quality. Getting the water tested will most likely lead you in the right direction.=|`|wsbp0nuzaa	Change the whole tank and buy a new one cleaned with bleach.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	you could be over feeding them or you may have to do a full tank change and clean the gravel I know this because when I first started with my first tank I had the same problem.    17 years experience with fish

Do you let her run the house when your not home? If you do you might want to get her a cage and put her in it while you're at work. She will hold it as long as she can since she's in such a small space.If you don't want to go that route block her in to one room of the house and line the floor with newspaper or potty pads. Every few days take away a pad or patch of paper until you get down to just one. That way the puppy will go in one area.<br>  Make sure to take her outside before you leave and right away when you get home. Every time she goes potty outside give her a treat and tell her good girl. She will catch on fast, like I said she's a smart breed.<br>  Another thing to keep in mind is you can only expect her to hold it 1hour for every month she is old while she's a puppy.

I38WF5aFaa	Eagle Pack Power formula is a good choice.  Its a popular food among mushers including 4 time Iditarod winner Martin Buser.  I don't know any mushers who feed Nature's Variety or Innova.  I also don't know any who feed the Eagle Pack holistic dog foods.  Some other foods that are commonly fed to working huskies are National,  Blackwood and Redpaw.

Or how about going to the humane society and asking if their vet is willing to help you out for less than the cost of a normal vet, or pro bono.    Or you can ask your vet if they're willing to work out a payment plan.    When your dog is sick, or suffering, there is no excuse to not do what you can to get him treated. if you can't afford a pet, don't have the pet.    Its not fair to let the cancer spread (if it is cancer) simply because you can't afford it.    that's like a parent saying "I can't afford baby food and food for myself, so I'll let my baby starve".    especially when so many options are available to you, a few listed above. it's selfish. When you take on the responsibility of a living animal, you can't just throw your hands up and say "Oh well. whatever." You do what you can or you give it up to someone else who can.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Your dog needs a diagnosis & it doesn't sound good from your description.  I do have links for financial  assistance for vet bills or  foundation grants for certain breeds  I give  out to help ppl but without a accurate diagnosis & treatment plan from your vet they won't even look at you.  Beg, borrow, sell or get more credit whatever it takes if you want to save your dog.|`|GSf09ALBaa	The lump is going to continue to grow.  I understand not having the money for cancer treatment; it is terribly expensive.      I don't enjoy saying this and please know it comes from my heart, but your dog is going to die a very painful death as this grows and it may very well move to other organs of his body.    If you cannot afford to treat him for it, do what is best for your dog before the horrific pain begins and let him go gently while he is not suffering.  Because he will, very soon.    My thoughts are with you and my heart is hurting.|`|2O58btqxaa	i can only suggest taking him to the vet as this lump is just going to get bigger and bigger and cause him pain hope he s ok x|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	get a second opinion. they can't be sure that it is cancer just because of it's sudden appearance and fast growth. Have they done any biopsies or blood work? Are they sure that it is not a fatty tumor that just needs to be removed?    Biopsies can be as simple as doing a fine needle aspiration, they just suck out some of the cells with a hypodermic needle and then run them under a microscope to see what the tumor is made of.|`|AA11351227	I have to agree about doing the humane thing and letting the dog go. Usually there are vets that will work with you on payments. If you want this dog to live any kind of life you need to make more of an effort to finding someone to help you pay or working with you. Some rescue clinics will help you.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Arrrghhh this is so frustrating?  Look I know I love your dog and I know you want the best for him but people who cannot afford to pay for vet bills whatever the situation (cancer, pet been run over, serious ongoing illness, anything) SHOULD NOT HAVE A DOG. Simple.    Edit: I'm sorry but you say your dog possibly has cancer and then you say you canc't afford the treatment he needs?  "We simply can't afford that?" Well, I guess your dog is going to die then. Maybe your boyfriend has been laid off but any responsible owner should have insurance or an emergency fund or something. You can plead poverty all you want but there is no excuse for what you are doing. Get your dog put to sleep if you can't find a way to pay for the care he so obviously needs. At least then he'll die painlessly contrary to how he'll die if you let him die slowly.|`|HvWQOus7aa	im not used to syaing this but if he gets worse and its to the point were he acts depressed lays down often and looks uncomfterble maybe start considering that u may have to do wats best for him do wat u know for sure would take the pain away in a humane way|`|5d2e89e3c42849fd0b6deb648cab3f3daa	My dog is my best friend and part of the family.

e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	I'm not sure what you mean by a black ring.  Look up pictures of Russian tortoises- some black coloration around the mouth is perfectly normal.    Did he get something wet/sticky around his mouth and then get substrate/dirt stuck to it?    I suppose it could be some sort of mouth rot... Is he eating properly?  Does the inside of his mouth look red/inflamed?     I'm guessing it's just natural pigmentation and it's nothing to worry about, but without actually seeing it it's hard to tell.|`|eSoU2C3Waa	i think so.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	If this were normal coloration, it shouldn't have developed just now; it would've already been there... How long have you had your tortoise, and what are you feeding him and what kind of substrate are you using? He could have eaten something sticky and then got some substrate stuck to his mouth, but a soak should get that off... Otherwise I'm pretty sure it's mouth rot. Most mouth rot looks like white cheesy growth in the mouth or blisters leaking yellow pus o the tongue, but there is a kind that looks like black or brownish spots that eventually sluff off. So take a look in his mouth and see what you find... Try crushing up a clove of garlic and putting that into his soak water. I have found this to really help mouth rot many times. That was recommended by a vet I see. Garlic has many disinfective properties and promote growth of healthy skin, so it's a good thing to try for mouth rot before using harsh antibiotics and betadine rinses. If it doesn't work, he needs to be seen and treated by a reptile vet.
DLxh9CANaa	If you can get these books, I would recommend the following: Misty of Chincoteague, Stormy, Misty's foal, My Friend Flicka and its sequels, Thunderhead and The Green Grass of Wyoming, Fury, Stallion of Broken Wheel Ranch and its sequels, Fury and the Mustangs and Fury and the White Mare, National Velvet, The Black Stallion series by Walter Farley, Commanche of the Seventh Cavalry ( which you'll LOVE, because it tells the true story of the only survivor of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, a famous cavalry horse, and his owner/rider, Captain Miles Keogh)     Other books I'd recommend to someone your age include Smoky, by Will James, Ride the Wild Storm and The Cabin on Ghostly Pond, by Marjorie Reynolds, Brighty of the Grand Canyon and King of the Wind,which were written by the same person who wrote Misty of Chincoteague, Sky Rocket: The story of a little bay horse, by Margaret Cabel Self, and Summer Pony, Winter Pony, and The Monday Horses, all written by Jean Slaughter Doty. Black Beauty is also another one of my favorite horse stories, as are Born to Run and Born to Trot.     If you want to read books about the racing world, try reading the "Bonnie" series by Barbara Van Tuyl. This is a series of books about a young woman and her famous filly, Sunbonnet. As far as non fiction books go, I hesitate to recommend some of the ones which have been mentioned so far by other people, because a lot of them are so sad. I have the Ruffian biography by Jane Schwartz, and that is one of the most heartbreaking stories I have ever read ( and what's worse is that I actually SAW Ruffian's last, ill fated Match race, and can remember the announcer screaming about her breakdown) and I don't recommend it to younger readers for that reason. I haven't read the Barbaro stories as yet, but I don't really need to, because I am familiar with Barbaro's connections, especially his trainer, in ways which most other people are not. I can't comment on whether the books themselves are any good, however. I also would NOT recommend reading the Horse Whisperer, because it too is very sad, and the descriptions of the accident contained within it are VERY GRAPHIC. ( The movie that was made from this book makes this even worse, if you ask me- that's why I can't watch that part of it.)       I hope this helps.|`|wJRHTS7Maa	black beauty is good also so is seabiscuit and fiction books theres king of the wind misty of the Chinoege and stormy mistys foal so good luck|`|TNTFomKeaa	Black Beauty!

Other good horse books are:  Black Beauty  Misty of Chincoteague  Stormy, Misty's Foal  Barbaro: America's Horse (It's sort of half non-fiction, half fiction)  Seabiscuit  The Horse Whisperer  My Friend Flicka  A Horse of Her Own (by Annie Wedekind)    And some good non-fiction horse books are:  The Complete Horse and Rider (By Sarah Muir and Debby Sly) - I got this from a friend and it's a very good book and very informative. It tells you a lot about the tack and equipment and lots of good information on riding!  I also had this A-Z Book of Horse Breeds but I don't remember the exact name of it, and even though it is sort of a kids/teen book, it's not bad.  Just search or google horse books and look at horse supply websites to see if they have anything. Like www.horse.com or www.statelinetack.com    Hope I helped!|`|tde3Aadfaa	the Phantom Stallion Wild Horse Island Series is pretty good, but you might be too old for it. try the black stallion series or these two books that go together: Riding Lessons( 1) and Flying Changes( 2) by Sara Gruen.

B6zl0AJDaa	1.Not sure what type of western saddle your're riding in BUT unless this rig is REALLY big or REALLY small on you, it's probably NOT your saddle.  You may need to learn to round your horse off to make his gaits smoother and easier to sit.  A hollowed out horse (One who sticks his head up and out.) is a LOT harder to sit than a rounded off horse.  Time for a few lessons on your horse with a trainer.  2.  He needs to learn to work in an arena with other horses.  A trainer can arrange for you to take group lessons and this will help you learn to teach him to listen to YOU and not worry about the other horses in the arena.  3.  Boots, jeans, western hat, gloves, tie and chaps (Shot gun style).  4.  Look at Arab treed saddles.  Those will give you the clearance you need through the gullet for your horse's withers.  5.  Walk, trot (LOTS of trotting) and rounding out at both gaits.  Then when you're ready, you can canter.  Best bet is to FIND a trainer and either haul in for lessons or board at that stable for a couple of months and take lessons.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	1. Horses often get nervous at show time and racing the other horses is just pure instinct.  3. Try shopping at tack exchanges or on the used rack at local tack shops.  4. you might have to special prder a saddle like that, call all of the tack stores in your area and compare prices go for the cheapest. (brand isn't everything)  5. When riding try to work on both side of the horse an equal amount of time, that works the muscles on each side the same amount and evenly tones them.|`|AA11600186	oooh, take your time!  If you're this upset about cantering at a show, then you really shouldn't be just yet!  Do what you and your horse do well, more advanced stuff will come in time. If you are having trouble controlling your horse, or if him going to fast unbalances you, just take your time and work on it!      if you think he has a saddle problem, get it fixed ASAP, it will only develop into more behavioral problems.  If your horse has really high withers, you will need a special saddle, otherwise get him measured and see what works.  consider a wintec with changable gullets.|`|5kUxkun3aa	If your horse is not comfortable do not ride until the problem has been fully investedgated. Get a saddler to check your saddle asap.|`|VmZKZjP1aa	1. One word: practice. The more you ride him the more comfortable you'll get, and the more he'll learn. Make sure you exorcise him regularly. Arab's tend to be high strung and need regular activity. Lunge him before you show him so he gets some of the extra energy out. Like you said, it could be the saddle.   2. Work him out every time before working with a group, to help get the P&V out. Horses have a natural tendency to "keep up" with or be in front of the heard. The more you ride with groups, the better he will be. He needs to learn to listen to what you want.  3. Unless you are doing some national show, you don't have to spend a ton. For general shows (unless the show specifies what you should wear) , just get a western shirt that matches your blanket. Get some Lexol and shine up your saddle and bridle.   Look online. There are all kinds of cheep western shirts. You can wear jeans regular or black. Go to Walmart. I bet you can get most of what you need from there. Try ebay...  We are on a budget to, but if you look around, I know you'll find some cheap stuff. You generally want your hat, pants, belt and boots to match. And your shirt to match your saddle blanket.   4. Here's a link to saddle fitting. http://iceryder.net/saddlefittingguides....  Or try going to a saddle store, talk to the people there. Get some good ideas on a few brands/types/sizes of saddles, then look on ebay for them used. You'll find them a lot cheaper online.   5. Do poles, barrels, lunging, pretty much any ride is going to build muscle. Make sure you are feeding them good quality hay. That will help. FYI- Arabians don't really build up muscle like a quarter or others. They are slender horses.     Good luck. Hope this helps.|`|4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	1. An uncomfortable canter could be ill-fitting saddle, it could be a horse that's unbalanced because his rider is unbalanced, it could be a horse who hasn't been properly trained to move with balance. You say you get nervous come show time.  If you're stiffening your spine and not riding fluidly, this could be causing him difficulty in balance and confidence.  The only way to tell if the saddle fits it to have an educated saddle fitter look and tell you if the saddle is fitting.  If, when you're done riding, you pushing on his back muscles makes him flinch, he may be sore in a certain area from the saddle.  Also, depending on your build, the saddle may fit well without weight in it, but your weight changing the function of the saddle.  Have a proper saddle fitter or tack sales person fit the saddle for you.  2.  How can you make the assumption that your horse doesn't like cantering in a group?  A horse that races may actually be liking it and having fun.  The point is, the horse is not in your control - you must learn to control him and try to determine why he's racing.  You must not give him human attributes - I can guarantee you that he's NOT showing you he's the best.  he's either doing it because he doesn't know what you want, he is worried, excited or nervous - all reasons which still mean he's not in your control.  You must practice, away from the shows in a group getting him to collect and slow down - showing him this is what you wish properly and rewarding him for doing so.  You may need help from a professional to do this.  3.  What you wear depends on what level shows you're competing in - for example a backyard open show you could get away with a nice plaid western shirt, tie, clean jeans and good boots - but if you're showing Arab circuit shows, high level shows or state competitions, you may require something a little pricier.  You need to attend some shows without participating and observe what's being worn and ask the judge if you can what that particular type of show's rules are.  You know if you go to the show and all the competitors are wearing very expensive show clothes that you won't win unless you are competitive with them.  I sell show clothes for english and western showing.  The clothing you wear depends on the type of show and class - showmanship for example, requires a different outfit than pleasure classes.  We sell show clothes anywhere from $100 for a top to $1000 for a top and hats from $35 to $700.  We also make clothes and if you have a person close to you who's a good seamstress, you can purchase fabric and make your own fairly inexpensively.  Also, go to tack swaps or get involved in something like 4H where a group often shares clothing to keep expenses down.  Watch ebay for deals and get to sales.  We have a whole show rack that's on sale for 50% off all the time,  They're perfectly good clothes but maybe last year's styles or colors.  Go to the Hobby Horse website, they tell you based on your color and the color of your horse what colors work best for you in the show ring.  4.  There aren't saddles built specifically for high-withered horses (I sell those too).  The width of a saddle is what makes it sit right on the horse or not - adding certain types of pads can help the fit too.  When you are sitting on the saddle on the horse, you need two fingers worth of space between the horse's withers and the bottom of the pommel.  When you put the saddle on, pull the pad or blanket up into the gullet of the saddle under the pommel so that when you add your weight to the saddle, you're not putting undue pressure on the horse's withers by pulling the pad down - it's like when you get a wedgie or a sock pulled up tight when you put your boots on.  5.  Balanced workouts are what build muscles evenly - do everything you do one direction exactly the same the other direction.  Circles large to small, changes of direction build muscle.  Trotting builds wind.  Make sure whatever you do that your horse is having fun.  Here's what fun is NOT to a horse - trotting and trotting and working an working, going from one thing to another without reward.  Here's how to keep it fun:  when you ask your horse to do something, let's say you want him to slow down cantering - start out allowing him to canter at his own pace.  Ask him to drop his head and collect - when he does this as you wish allow him to stop and rest - this is his reward and the reward says "you did what I asked".  Then go on and repeat the exercise building up until he understands what you want over the course of 2-5 sessions or so.  Here's an example:  I want my horse to drop her head - how do I ask?  I jiggle both reins without pulling and while keeping my whole body relaxed.  When she dips her head even for a second, I stop jiggling immediately and praise her allowing her to stand quietly for a moment.  Then I sit quietly and jiggle again.  it'll take nearly as long, but she drops her head again and I stop immediately and prais

What does determine a dog's temperment is  1 how it's bred; if it is inbred or if one or especially both of its parents are nervous by nature it might become aggressive and  2 treatment; if the dog is locked in a small back yard and is never socialized or if the dog is starved and/or beaten it might become aggressive.  Just because a dog is a Pit or a Rottie or a Dobie, it doesn't mean it's going to turn on its owner.  I own a Pit mix and a Rottweiler and both of them are extremely affectionate and playful and have never shown any aggression towards humans, and I have had them both for several years.

A lot of people ignore that sign and then bam it happens.|`|GpiRaSvPaa	I have only heard this myth about the 3 "pit bull" breeds recently, but I know it use to be said about Dobermans years ago. NO dog, no matter what breed it is, turns on people or just randomly attacks for no reason. Dog aggression is nearly always preceded by some kind of warning, and there is ALWAYS a reason behind the attack. However, many inexperienced owners do not recognize the dog's behavior as aggression, or refuse to acknowledge it as a warning sign. The only exception I can think of is Springer Rage, a rare and controversial neurological condition that manifests itself as a spontaneous attack, followed by confusion, and then a return to normal behavior. And none of the breeds that are most commonly considered "dangerous" are prone to this condition. I'm actually pretty sure the "springer" breeds are more prone to this condition than other breeds, hints the name. But I couldn't say that for sure.    Anyway, It's kind of funny to me that you would ask if maybe a GSD or Golden would be a better family pet than breeds like Rotties, Dobies and Chows, because GSDs are right up there with Rotties, Dobies and Chows on the so-called "dangerous" breed lists. And, in temperament testing, many of these so-called "dangerous" breeds test as good or better than most of the popular family breeds!     Some of the breeds that are most commonly considered "dangerous" would be the 3 "pit bull" breeds, American Pit Bull Terriers (APBTs), American Staffordshire Terriers (AmStaffs) and Staffordshire Bull Terriers (Staffies), and then Rottweilers, Dobermans, Chows, German Shepherd Dogs (GSDs) and even Boxers. Some of the most popular family breeds are Labs, Goldens, Pugs, Beagles, Boston Terriers, Collies, Yorkies and Dachshunds. Now, in temperament testing, here is what each of the above breeds scored, in order from best to worst...    Lab - 91.8%  Pug - 90.0%  Staffie - 88.8% (so-called "dangerous" breed)  Boston - 85.5%  APBT - 84.3% (so-called "dangerous" breed)  Boxer - 84.3% (so-called "dangerous" breed)  Golden - 84.2%  GSD - 83.5% (so-called "dangerous" breed)  Rottweiler - 82.6% (so-called "dangerous" breed)  Yorkie - 82.1%  Cocker - 81.7%  Beagle - 80.3%  Collie - 79.4%  Doberman - 77.1% (so-called "dangerous" breed)  Dachshund - 70.2%  Chow - 70.0% (so-called "dangerous" breed)    Even the lowest score on this list, 70.0%, is better than what many other breeds scored. http://atts.org/statistics.html    It all just depends on how a dog is bred, raised, trained and socialized. Any dog can be aggressive, any dog can bite, any dog can attack, any dog can cause serious harm, and any dog could even kill a person or another animal. At the same time, any breed of dog can be a friendly, family pet.     My husband and I currently own an APBT named Brooklyn. But, we have owned 3 APBTs before and we have even had up to as many as 10 APBTs living in our home at one time. Also, the majority of our close friends and family own APBTs, AmStaffs, Staffies and/or "pit bull" mixes. And even though the 3 "pit bull" breeds are often considered "dangerous", I personally have never met an aggressive "pit bull". Also, my grandma use to own and breed Dobermans, and not one had any aggression issues. My mom and 2 uncels grew up in a home with many Dobermans all the time and none of them were ever bitten or attacked by a Dobie. I have, however, met many aggressive dogs of other breeds, especially Labs! I was attacked by a Lab when I was younger, my brother was attacked by a Lab, my neighbors, from when I was growing up, owned a Lab that attacked 5 people (including young children) before he was put down and most recently, our APBT was attacked, in our own yard, by our ex-neighbors Lab/GSD mix!    As I said before, any breed can be aggressive and any breed can be a great family pet, it's all on the owner. But, at the same time, you have to do some serious research to find out what breed is best for you and your family, because not all breeds are for everyone. Research, research, research, then properly raise, train, socialize and controll and you shouldn't have any problems! : )|`|nzU1tNX7aa	it depends on how u raise them|`|zQdYBoSpaa	It is true that those dogs tend to turn on there owners. I had a golden retriever she was the greatest dog you could ever ask for. Goldens are very loyal to their owners. If i were you i would deffently go with a golden retriever. The only downside to goldens is that they are prone to cancer. My old dog was a golden and got leg cancer n we had to put her to sleep.:( We just got a new golden puppy though. They are really good with children and are perfect for your 1st dog. Deffntly dont get a Doberman.|`|gMNXzDa0aa	Well it depends how you raise them and train hem they could be friendly and sweet bu they could also be mean and vicious. But with small dogs it is the same it matters how you raise them and train them.|`|7vJNHaskaa	All dogs can sometimes turn on their owners...not just a specific breed. It all depends on how they were raised/socialized/trained. All three of those breeds make excellent pets.|`|pHLTGduoaa	If you treat your dog well, and show it love and affection, it will do the same to you. Any dog will turn on it's owner if it's abused.
B6zl0AJDaa	I found it easier to copy & paste from the Stubben website than to explain.    "The Stbben tree is a flexible spring tree that is tensioned using materials that counter balance each other. The steel bars beneath the tree, which by themselves would lay flat, are prevented from doing so by the webbing on the top of the the tree. Inversely, the webbing cannot flex too much because of the resistance offered by the steel bars below. These two components, working together, combine to create a perfect shock absorbing system."    Here's the whole thing on their site:    http://www.stubbennorthamerica.com/stuSo...|`|EghHVkHEaa	Some english spring tree saddles or leather tree saddles bend more than others if you are in doubt ask to have the saddle checked buy a saddler.|`|5kUxkun3aa	As it sound it adds more spring. A lot of people don't like them. I used to ride with one I loved it.
B6zl0AJDaa	Knee rolls were popular back in the 1950-60's aka Stubben Siegfried for example.  They gave the rider something to brace against over a fence.  Then, in the early 1970's Hermes came up with the close contact design (No knee roll, smooth, once piece flap) and EVERYBODY fell in line with them, Crosby with their Prix De Nations was the most popular economically made European (British).  The idea was that the riders legs would eventually get the leather to mold closer to the horse's body and make it's own knee rolls, sans the suede.    What they didn't figure out was that a LOT of riders still preferred the knee rolls.  Folks were STILL buying Stubben Siegfrieds which were known for their knee rolls.      Nowadays, both styles are once again acceptible!    http://www.stubbennorthamerica.com/stuAl...|`|EghHVkHEaa	My saddle has knee roles, but after riding in the school saddles for so long (they don't have knee roles) i really honestly couldn't tell the difference. But its a tad bit more comfy, and much better looking haha. Crosby is a very nice saddle brand btw, totally reccomend it. I learned how to jump in saddles without knee roles, it dosent matter a bit if you have them or don't. Hope this helps.|`|9BNHNcDbaa	i prefer knee roles because it prevents my knee from sliding past the saddle, i was riding in a pony saddle with no knee roles soo it may be different, test some out at the tack store and see which is more comfy|`|woBLf8LUaa	If you are jumping you need knee rolls. A english saddle without knee rolls is called equitation saddle. It's for ground english riding. Jumping saddles have high cantles and fenders are forwards more with knee rolls.|`|z0iTOf88aa	I personally absolutely hate kneerolls and know a ton of people who also hate them.  I find that it makes me grip more with my knees (not the 'proper' way to ride) rather than my lower leg.  As Rosi said, they were a 'style' in which people fell in love with for awhile.|`|CGkgsjVbaa	if You have a good enough seat ?  E.g try riding bare back does your leg stay where its surpose to ?? i cant really feel the differences
woBLf8LUaa	No, I would not do so until you are ready for a 17in. Why? becuase when you are in a bigger saddle than you need your balance is off and it's easy to loose balance while riding or jumping etc. Make sure that a 16in saddle is the correct size you need. to measure a saddle you measure from the pomel to the cantle.|`|21U2oP9eaa	Well, most likely you wont have the saddle forever,(showing, Weekend rides, Practice, Being brought into a stall, ect.) and you are still at a growing point so buy the saddles as you grow into them|`|S7uh7eG6aa	The inch measurement on an english saddle is the tree length, not the seat length. A big horse needs a big saddle and vice versa, but you can have a small seat on a 17 inch saddle ( I do because I'm tiny, most people can't fit in my 17 inch saddle) or a flat 16 inch if you are bigger on a smaller or shorter backed horse.  Also, the saddle goes with the horse not the rider, so you won't have it forever unless you only ever have one horse|`|DDhsF8zYaa	Don't until you out grow it.    I'm almost 16 (in March) and my saddle, to my shock, is a 16!  I fit in it just perfectly, too!  I'm also not even 5'1" but that's not really the point! (;    Wait until you are too big for your current saddle, and ask your trainer too, they know best.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Measure yourself from you knee to your hip.  That will give you your current seat size.  Women grow up earlier and faster than boys and chances are you're already as tall as you are going to get.  I currently ride in the same size seat that I did as a 14 yr old and I'm in my 50's.    IF you were to buy a larger seated saddle than necessary, it WILL throw your equitation off anyway, so now that you know you've probably grown all you are going to, get yourself a saddle that fits.|`|EghHVkHEaa	I'm 15 and im riding in a 17.5 or 17 1/2. Well what you really need to ask yourself is...its a really personal quesiton i know...but have you started your period? That will tell you a whole lot about how much more your going to grow. But its not exactly safe to ride in a saddle that is larger than you need. Ask your trainer.    EDIT: Ok well you might grow a tad bit more, it really all depends. What i did was talk to my trainer, she asked me all that kinda personal stuff, and we finally came to the conclusion that 17.5 works for me, because not just for the size of the saddle itself, but the size of the leg flaps, because i have very long legs. Just talk to your trainer, he/she will be able to tell you which will best fit you. Good luck.|`|5kUxkun3aa	If you buy a saddle that is too big you will slide around.    Edit. Florayg is not correct. A English saddle is a whither fitting and a seat size.|`|9BNHNcDbaa	no...with horse stuff you buy things to fit now, if you get one too big it will affect your riding now, usually in a negative way, soo i wuld say to buy the correct size or a 16 1/2, but not a whole size up if it does not fit properly, have fun!!|`|eiVWEW3aaa	i ride in a 15", and it fits perfectly... (you should only be able to put 4 inches in front of you in your seat while sitting in it, if its less or more, you may want to change it.)    i don't think that you should get a bigger one becuz, im 13 too and i got one that fits me, and unless if you plan to gain weight, its not a good idea.    if the saddle is too big for you now, you might be flopping around at a canter. I would stay with the 16" if its the right size, and if your concerened about how much your gonna grow, buy a cheap saddle, that way it won't be a waste of your money!!
3wIZiZA5aa	I think you should put a time line in on how horses supposledly "evolved" even though they didn't  lol. Put in some horse terms no one has heard of before and have people guess the answer and then show them the answer. Also, put four different horses in it and have your group judge them, and then make them give reasons. <br>  <br>  Here's a website that will help with your problem:<br>  <a href="http://www.spiletta.com/UTHOF/hippology/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiletta.com/UTHOF/hippology/</a><br>  <br>  I used to judge a little, but never really got into it!<br>  <br>  Have Fun!|`|I55JNnvpaa	Awsome, in in hippology too! what state are you in?<br>  <br>  First... if they are all first year, start on colors, tack, ect. <br>  If they are good with that... start on the harder stuff.<br>  <br>  o, and yes, I judged at state. I got second and we are a huge group here in california!|`|brVS3Pg0aa	ive done hippology, i think you should start with the breed analysis ( what they are known for)..definitally have a small quiz on what placing to put the horses in a conformation class, maybe give out candie bar for first correct answer to keep it fun. For the quiz, have pics of maybe three horses, one wth good conformation, one with perfect, one with okay, and then ask them what order the horses shud be placed in! Also have the skeletal system and riding eqip. Have the gaits of horse on there too. I think that should do it because those things will take up atleast 2 slides each. Good Luck!!
OaaJ7o9Haa	Not exactly sure but I can hopefully help. Platies don't always have a visible gravid spot. If she is indeed bulging, and you are sure it's not from parasites, bacteria, dropsy or overeating, then she probably is pregnant. Average gestation period is 4 weeks but thats not absolute.<br>  <br>  Some platies will give birth at 5 or even 6 weeks because they can hold onto fry for a long time if they feel threatened or stressed. Stress can also cause them to abort. This rarely happens but it's more likely if you drop her in a breeding net or if she is constantly bullied. If she aborts, she'll have a big belly for a few days and it will slowly shrink.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is that she's spreading out he birth. Sometimes platies will give birth over a week instead of a few hours. Again it's about her stress and comfort.|`|uJJfco2Iaa	Not so good description but if your platy has a boxed belly and looks like it's bulging from the top its most likely prego. The only reason why a mother shall delay her babies is that she is stressed. If stressed they can go in labour in 2~4 months.
2AXTmluFaa	Mice, like hamsters, rats, gerbils etc all deserve a treat from time to time.    My hamster loves to lick yoghurt from the end of my finger =)    just make sure you don't over do it.|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	yeah, they make yogurt treats for rodents, try buying one at your local pet store.
s76aC4G8aa	Yes it is gross but a lot of dogs do this, it's called carprophagia and it usually means the dog is missing a nutrient in her diet that is causing her to eat her own feces.  In the case of a dog on the Dog Whisperer the dog was missing potassium in it's diet and Cesar replaced the desire to eat the poop with bananas as a treat.  Since it would take to long to try to figure out what the dog is missing I suggest you first look at the food you are feeding.  Is it a cheap brand that you picked up at the supermarket, wal-mart or even PetSmart?  Most cheap dog foods contain no meat, a ton of grains and filler foods, it's hardly nutritious for a dog and most of the time it smells the same coming out as it did going in.  If you are unfamiliar with your food or have no idea if it's any good go to www.dogfoodanalysis.com click on reviews then type in the name of the food i.e. Eukanuba, Iams, Beneful etc and you should be able to bring up a review of the food.  Look to see what it's rated 1-6 star, 6 being the highest quality 1 being the lowest and see if a change in diet is needed.    Next, keep your dog on a leash when she poops be right behind her with a pooper scooper and pick it up immediately to discourage this behavior.  Next train your dog the "leave it" command, once she learns this when you see her going for the poop say Leave IT and hopefully she'll avoid it, and lastly, you can give her for treats each night canned pineapple it'll make her poop taste and smell terrible making her want to avoid it.  I don't recommend you mixing it with her food just give a few pieces each night as a treat and soon she'll be avoiding her poop.    Also there are powders you can pick up in PetsMart that you put on their food to stop this behavior it's for carprophagia.    Good luck|`|geamDWBtaa	Wow ya i seen this on dog whisperer, these people had two dogs and they would always try to eat there poop, so when sesar, he took the dog and would work with it. Keep your dog on your leash with you, try this and see if it works, it may sound dumb but try it, have some stool near you or out side, n be by it, its just like trying to train your dog tricks i would say, but any time she tryes to eat the pup tell her no with a firm but not too loud, no,  and when she doesnt eat it or keep going near it give her a treat,,,,keep doing it and im sure it will work, im not no dog whisperer but trust me it will work. i guess im lucky our dogs dont even think about eating there poop........but like i said im not no dog whisperer i just seen a episode with that and that is how he did  it...........good luck.........|`|cDqG7xJ6aa	A lot of times when a dog eats its stool, the dog is lacking vitamins and minerals in its diet.  What type of dog food are feeding?  I would suggest feeding a vitamin/mineral supplement on top of her food.  Also there is a product made by Solid Gold that you put on their food that makes the stool taste really bad after it's gone through their system.  That might be enough to help. It's called Solid Gold SEP.|`|aInY5go2aa	Try sprinkling meat tenderizer on your dog's food. It works to help make the feces less appetizing to the dog.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Leash her up, take her out to potty, and pick it up right after she poops.|`|zL1sggpCaa	First, feed her more. Fill the bowl so she can eat what she wants....    Second, go right behind her and pick it up. Either take a baggy, keep your pooper-scooper handy or use the poop bags you can attach to your leash. Any way you look at it, clean it up when she does it.|`|Za8DpfvQaa	Most dogs do eat their own poop. You can solve it, by putting something citrus in her food (ex: Pineapple).    When she poos out her food, and tries to eat it, it will taste horrible.    This method has worked for many people (including me!)    Good Luck and Hope this helps!|`|kqa9VFrfaa	There is a product that U can buy to mix with food, and then the poop tastes so bitter that it discourages them from picking it up. If U can not stay with her to keep her from picking it up and eating it, then maybe U could build her a short run up off the ground with a wire bottom. Then she gets exercise, and the poop falls through the floor of the pen where U can pick up later.|`|rcV6WFCfaa	Dip her tail in liquid nitrogen whenever you catch her doing it.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    i saw a show on this last week : on a dog that did this. So i rememeber quite clearly...    The reason she is doing this is because she is laking fibre or protein.Something in her diet.  So when she poops she eats it to get double the protein or  fibre what ever she is lacking.  Also when she eats she needs to eat slowly. If she eats quickly. the food comes out really the same as it went in. So eating slowly will help her digest it and not taste nice. thats why she eats it.  Standing by your dogs bowl while she is eating, And adding a bit of food slowly. only when you allow. Will show her to eat slower. Add dry biscuits to it. no always dog food ( meat stuff) also when she is finished give her 3 small pieces of pineapple. it will help give the poo a yuki smell and taste.    God Bless x|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	your dog is probably lacking in some sort of nutrient. Maybe switch his dog food to a better quality dog food    Heres a list of known great quality dog food:    Artemis  Natural Balance  California Natural  Evo  Innova  blue buffalo  Wellness  Merrick  Nature's Variety  Timberwolf  Pinnacle  Eagle Pack    These are great dog food choices. Most of these dog foods are not found at Petco or Petsmart, so your going to have to go to another pet store to find these. Although Blue Buffalo is sold at i think Petsmart, and that is pretty good dog food.    Also a good trick to keep the dog from eating its poop is to stick some pineapple juice in his food. When it comes out, your dog wont find his poop very appetizing    i would also suggest picking up the dog poop more often, so your dog doesnt go searching|`|2qVcpkF3aa	What are you feeding her? Sometimes her diet doesn't have enogugh nutrients and then she goes to eat it. For right now, I would put some pineapple put it in her food and when she goes to poop and tries to eat it, it won't be tasty to her. It might just be phase depending on the age. If none of that helps then I would definately talk to your vet and maybe there's something he/she can give the dog. Other than that I'd give everything eles a try. Good luck!|`|673bc6b8fb57e4a11e9a3252086823f2aa	Read this article it helps:    http://www.petbehaviourcentre.com/articl...    P.S: I added pumpkin to her food and that helped my dog.|`|q5TchS9jaa	Most dogs eat their own poop for fiber. So try putting a fiber supplement in their food.|`|hCErpu7Eaa	Keep a muzzle on her until she's ready to eat her real food.|`|5dd6834efa64d7d372fc26ad42e3911eaa	Method  1: Training.  Whenever she tries to eat her stool, firmly tell her no and move her somewhere else.  When she starts responding to the no, give her a treat/toy as a reward.    Method  2: Use a product made and sold for this particular purpose.  It is a powder you sprinkle on or mix into your dog's food that makes the stool smell and taste aweful.  You can find it in specialty pet stores.
XRxLZYFwaa	It's just a case of practicing his "come" command. Start off in your yard where there is no distraction. Have your clicker and treats handy. Call him. If he even looks in your direction, click and treat. Repeat this. Every time you say come and he looks or comes, click and treat. Eventually, only click and treat when he comes if you say "come". Do this at random times. When he is out in the yard. When he is playing somewhere. Make it unexpected. Keep on practicing.   Later get a friend to come and help. Have the friend talk to your dog and basically lure him over there (but no touching just yet). Tell your dog to "come". Same drill as before, if he even just looks at you, click and treat. Later only treat if he comes to you. Remember to click the moment he turns his body away from the friend to come to you. If he does this well, have your friend start touching and playing with the dog. When the distraction is more, you once again start treating for any movement or look in your direction.  You carry on like this, adding distractions. When you feel he is ready for the park, take the treats and clicker with you. If he comes when called, make a HUGE fuss like it's the greatest trick ever. Never call his name in anger, or else he won't want to come. And don't despair if he runs off like usual the first while. It takes a LOT of practice to work. I'm using this technique with my 6 month old Australian Shepherd right now, and he has been improving a lot.    You might also want to get yourself a good book as reference like Karen Pryor's "clicker training for dogs".|`|gwUMipsUaa	Obedience classes.    In the US, it's illegal to have your dog off the leash, unless it's at a fenced in Dog Park.    So keep him on the leash, and do dog obedience classes as well.|`|v6mQzSSbaa	Don't let him off|`|xTAR26Gkaa	Go slow with training. Try taking him somewhere with no other dogs and work on training, with less distractions at first. Sometimes it'll work if you make a loud noise or fall down while he's wondering away from you. This will usually get his attention. He'll want to know what's going on. When he comes to you give him a treat, something good like chicken. Just keep repeating it til he gets the idea. Good luck!|`|kTyc7HhUaa	My dog had the same problem! I suggest you take your dog to a small enclosed off leash area. Carry around some very yummy treats such as a can of baby food. Make sure your dog knows you have these treats. When ever your dog runs off called him and give him this extra special food. Keep working at it, it takes time. Good luck!|`|AA11097657	You have bribed him and he has learnt that you will hang around and wait for him.    It is time to get running!    Run away in the opposite direction using loud high pitched screams to attract his attention whilst you are running.    We use this method when we train flyball dogs. It makes them come after you full flight!    Play with him and continue to run around for a few minutes when he reaches you.|`|ofUe4hBkaa	i think it would be best if you contacted a specialist.  maybe take the dog to obedience.  this will not only make the dog well manerd and well trained, it will also increase the bond between you both.|`|AaoclPYCaa	Don't let him off his leash.  Just get a longer one.|`|42ed0b617069464e77343114e09c7994aa	It's cause he sees you as a friend and not a pack leader (from the dog whisperer). We have a springer spaniel at home and if i'm not home and he gets out the front door my wife have a lot of trouble getting him back in to the house. But if he runs out the front door i just walk outside and he stops immediately when i speak to him. It's because he sees me as a pack leader and so much as a friend.|`|WLNX00c3aa	you need to practice with a longer leash and continue to train with him.  our trainer said to start off with a 50ft rope and slowly work from your back yard, to the street, to a small park to the actual park. having a person help with the training works best.    1st with tie the middle of the rope to the dog's collar. at each end, you should be 25ft apart...hold on to one end of the rope and have your friend call the dog over...so it's like a relay race. when the dog comes, feed him a treat...keep that up and then he'll get use to it.|`|6sTsDvKmaa	When you ask them to come to you, and they aren't forced to (like with the tug of a lead), it empowers the dog to ignore you.  Once he sees that you're not going to come after him, he will realize that he has to come to you.        I had the same problem with my golden, and the only thing that worked was a combination of reinforcing that I was the alpha dog (outside of the walk, and with a long lead), and hiking.  I let him off the leash and walked without worrying about him following.  Eventually he realized that I was the "lead dog" and he would not be able to be part of the pack if he got too far away.|`|8iHbDmHmaa	Don't let him off lead.  That would solve that.    Or try practicing with a long lead first.  You can buy 25 or even 50 foot leads.  If he doesn't come back, you still are in control.  And as he gets more reliable, you can start letting him off.|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	Train him to re-call with a long training leash. You letting your dog run free when he does not respond to you is only going to end in tragedy.  A dog that does not know re-call should never be let off the leash.|`|s76aC4G8aa	I hate to say this but you should never let a dog off leash if they do not have perfect recall.  There are too many more interesting smells out there and why would the dog return to you you're boring, at least in your dogs eyes you are, why would he want to return and get leashed up when there are about 1 million different smells to follow up on?    If you don't have perfect recall with him and this takes a lot of practice ON LEASH to do, DO NOT let him off in an unfenced area.  A clicker is not for recall a clicker is to "mark" a desired behavior in place of treats so no it won't work.  You can replace the clicker with a whistle and train him that the whistle means treats really good treats like hot dogs, load the whistle the same way you would load a clicker only ON LEASH and work in a fenced in area on his recall using the whistle.  Until he has perfected this in a fenced in area he is not ready to be allowed off leash.|`|s9haCi64aa	He has learnt he doesnt have to come to you when called. You need to change your recall word as the one you have been using has been weakened.     Buy 50ft of rope and put a clip on the end, he can still run about but you can reel him in if he ignores you. You need to be able to enforce the command or they do learn to ignore you.

I use a differ|`|R79hGyI0aa	it's tough to teach a lab to stay right with you, but if you're comfortable having a bit of distance just find an area where it's ok for him to be out and about and spend a lot of time with him off leash. as he gets used to it it'll be less exciting and he'll learn to stay with you.     also, don't chase after him- if he's running away, turn away and start walking and he should come back. most dogs run away to get you to chase them. then give him a treat when he comes back on his own. and once he gets a little better, don't be afraid to scold him when he takes a step backwards- make sure he knows your the boss.|`|kvYgopThaa	We have that problem with our lab she is a year old. Labs are just natually hyper and curious but good dogs. we just have to keep her on a leash other than when we have her in a pin.

Good luck!|`|Xxr5iKSnaa	My dog is part lab and beagle. My father built him a very nice and large lot so he could run around (and he runs crazily when I put him in the lot). If you have a big enough yard to place a lot then do it. It does cost money, but it's worth it.     Before I had the lot, I got 3 or 4  5 foot leashes and tied them together securely and ran with him for a while.

First price depends on the quality of dog you buy which for good quality health tested maltese would be $1000-$2000 easily but you can adopt for a fully vetted dog from $200-$400 usually.  Haircuts prices depend on your area here in Atl. good shop will charged between $35-45 for a short clip. Clips should be done at least every 6-8 wks for short to maintain.    You have to figure in yearly vet visits, shots, heartworm, flea meds also.  Food costs depends on quality of food but for a small dog $20 a month is realistic.    They need exercise with daily walks & can be crated up to 8,9 hr when trained & house broken.  I wouldn't allow dog free roam until grown & has shown to be she can be trusted    Rabbits should be fine if introduce properly.|`|PTxaUkwKaa	You don't sound like you have any business owning a dog. Your second, third, and fourth questions all pertained to money. If you can't afford a dog, don't get one. I'd say a dog will cost you roughly $1,000+ a year, as far as grooming, vet care, heart worm preventative, flea preventative, and food. It's almost like having a child, they aren't cheap and need lots of attention. Get another rabbit or something.|`|W0buucLsaa	A Maltese is clearly a bad choice for you. They have long hair that requires extensive grooming. You either have to do that yourself or pay for it a couple of times a week. It doesn't sound like you have the money or time for a dog, but if you DO decide to get one...    There are plenty of short-haired miniature breeds out there that would be better choices. Min pins, short-haired chihuahuas, boston terriers, Italian greyhounds, fox terriers - these would be good choices, they require no haircuts or grooming apart from occasional baths. (Dachshunds are not on this list because a proper dachshund would kill a rabbit inside two seconds. Don't get one.)|`|iXijnCxOaa	1) If you want short fur, get a dog with short fur... don't get a dog bred to have long fur and then cut it off!!!  2) Re-read  1.    3) If you're concerned about cost.. don't get one.  A well-bred dog will be $1000 and up.  4) See  3  5) Training is the issue, not whether the dog is "good with" rabbits.  6. NO.  If you don't have time for a dog, don't get one.    A stuffed animal is a FAR better choice!
pDPSaL37aa	I would get the first one. The second one doesn't look like it allows enough oxygen inside and it's also for a reptile. It may be a bit harder to clean and assemble the first one, but it's worth it. It looks like it has a lot more activities for the hamster. It only shows Dwarf hamsters in the picture, so if you are planning on getting a Syrian hamster, make sure it can fit in the tubes.|`|Km6gOd61aa	You should definitely get the first one. The second one has wood and your hamster(s) could chew on it and get splinters on they're tongue. Also, it doesn't look like the most exciting cage for a hamster and he'll get bored of it quickly.     Also it says that the second ones a playpen and a hamster can't live in a playpen.

6MPOB4jjaa	Dwarf rats are about 1/2-1/3 the size of standard rats. They are genetically dwarf, not just small standards. They can be dumbo, as dumbo is just a variation on ear type. They are larger than mice. They also are supposed to have larger eyes, their feet are smaller in proportion to their bodies, and their tails are shorter. We have a couple dwarf ratties, two with standard ears, and another with dumbo ears. You can see pics on our website... tmcuriouscritters.com (the dwarfs names are Pippen, Biscotti, and Cricket) We will be going out west this summer to get some more dwarf ratties! They do tend to be a little more active than standards, but they are a lot of fun and still really sweet.

As you can see, they are pretty much the same, just, small.

Arab and Quarter, when you get the right mix they are a beautiful horse!  Trails, I would say Morgan/Arab.  Either way you have the strength, agility and endurance. Many competitive trail riders do TB/Arab.|`|EghHVkHEaa	While some breeds may be more suitable than others there are always exceptions to the rule. Quarter Horses often make great beginner horses because of their even temperament, but some can be quite "hot" or energetic for a beginner. Arabians are reputedly hot. But many are quiet and trustworthy. So there is no right or wrong breed. The individual temperament of the horse and its training are more important than its pedigree.     Many new owners like draft crosses and draft breeds. These horses often have a quiet demeanor and some older riders enjoy. The downside of drafts and draft crosses is their size. Sometimes saddle fitand tack sizing can be difficult. For a rider with shorter legs or decreased flexibility just getting on and sitting on the horse can be a challenge. The larger the horse the larger the feed bill as well.     Many new owners and riders are attracted to gaited breeds like and Icelandic Horses. These horses are bred for good temperaments and hardiness. But again, much depends on individual temperament and training.|`|mKWwz1uUaa	For me and my personal needs and usage with the horses is the QH/Arb, I've owner both Arabian, QH's and currently the QH/Arb mix:)  Love it, for others I'm sure it's different depending on what discipline they do:)  What's your fav?|`|XL62syrCaa	Quarab (Quarter Horse Arabian x) (This also includes Paint Arab x)  Azteca (Quarter Andalusian x)  Morab (Morgan Arabian x)  Draft crosses      These are my favorites.

I myself breed arabians and while they tend to get a bad rep for being hot blooded, it really depends on what TYPE of arabian you get and from whom. I deal with the old egyptian lines in Straight Egyptian and Al Khamsa arabians. I don't like the polish or russian lines or the domestic bred. But that is my opinion. I have some good freinds who breed the domestic and they are great, I just find they take more work and there for i spend more time working then playing. They are bred for looks not temperment but are what most people go after.     While the SE and AK still have that arab spunk and get up and go, they tend to bloom into awesome horses with age. By five many of them tend to have a simular outlook on life as a QH but they tend to retain their youthful attitudes well into 20's. I have thrown saddles on the young ones and have literally had to chase them to get them to move and feel the saddle and stirrups on them. Not a buck.    I have crossed QH with my AK mares and found they turn out to be AMAZING horses with sound minds but the typy look of the arab, however it always depends on the breeder too. My horses are introduced to many things like tarps, trailers, ropes rugs and everything you can imagine when they are young so by the time they mature enough to start undersaddle by 3-4 they tend to be easy easy.  You could take the same horse and stick him out in pasture until he is two and find he is a lot harder to start.     There are so many factors that can influence how a horse turns out. Mostly it depends on the owner and the rules and limits that owner sets, expessially with the young ones. :)|`|S7uh7eG6aa	Best for what? kids, competition, hauling logs? be more specific please|`|xKHeYmQJaa	Mustang/Arabian    More sense and endurance than each breed separately.|`|qjcTW2vJaa	ABSOLUTE fave that I am in love with are Thorodales (Thoroughbred/ Clydesdale).

hQ6ZqHjzaa	You could check local rescues, I;ve heard the RSPCA have started taking in hamsters. <br>  <br>  Pet shops are usually in it for the profit, so their hamsters do tend to be very young and some have just left their mom. Your best bet is to call the pet shop to see how old they are, however they are not gonna tell if they have unhealthy hamsters.<br>  <br>  So you would have to visit one to find out these details. I would say pick out a hamster that you like the look off and ask them if you can hold it. You then want to check if its healthy, check that its fur is clean and there are not bald patches or 'dandruff''. Check that the eyes are bright and clear (not weepy), check the nose and mouth and ensure that they are clear (no dribbling/dripping), check the feet for deformities and injuries. And make sure you check the hamsters rear is clean and there's nothing stuck to it ot anything, the last thing you wanna do is bring home a hamster with wet tail.|`|q0rLBQo2aa	If they can't / won't answer the question, they aren't competent or honest enough to buy from. Unfortunately, chain stores, from hardware to quilting to pets, hire people with no knowledge of what they're doing, and who are taught only, "Say what they want to hear. Make the sale!" A good pet store that doesn't carry the kind of pet you want can often refer you to someone local who will provide you with good stock, even if they don't advertise as commercial breeders. That's tough to find with Hamsters, but give it a try. Check out how their other animals are kept: clean spacious cages or warehoused and dirty? You can rate many pet stores with your eyes closed. If they stink, or have an obvious disinfectant / deodorant cover-up smell, GET OUT!|`|y0fmBIP2aa	None of the workers there will have a clue as to how old the hamster are or where they got them. They get them from critter farms, and trust me, they are usually the most ill-mannered creatures you will be unlucky enough to cross paths with. The stores own employees have trouble putting them in the box, not to mention all the heebie-jeebies the critters usually have. But if that's all you can get, expect the hamster you get to be pregnant, if female. There's about a 70% chance it will be, cause the stores put males and females together. There will not be any babies there, so choose the ones running on the wheel, digging, and eating/drinking, or if they're asleep, breathing normally. Don't buy a hurt critter out of pity. You'll regret it. Hope I helped! I know I was a little pessimistic. :)|`|ZeYYHByTaa	yup, most petshops do provide info but its best to go in-store|`|5zvpth52aa	I don't know really :/ pet shops around my area suck.<br>  <br>  I bought a baby budgie and what happens 3 days later? he dies.

Just make sure they look healthy (no wounds, no dry tail, no watery eyes). <br>  <br>  There are some questions that pet store clerks will be vague about like the sex of the hamster because they just want you to buy the hamster.<br>  <br>  They should be able to tell you how old they are. Most times, the parents are at the pet store. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JmD0oq2Naa	my hamster was about 6 months when i got him from a petshop. and there is nothing wrong with buying small animals from petshops. not everyone can find breeders or find them in shelters

After all it will be her 'first birthday, and we think she'll 'deserve it' for surviving without getting killed because right now she's a pain in the 'patootie!'|`|9gMQAWBNaa	We do not exactly have a birthday for her, she gets whatever she wants to eat (spagetti is her favourite) and a silly squeaky toy.

If people didn't have parties for dogs, there wouldn't be websites like first one below.<br>  Don't worry what other people say.  Have fun with your dog!!!<br>  (The other 2 sites are my website and my blog - no pictures of the party though.)|`|Y1cKH9Tgaa	yes i do i believe that are animals should have the same respect for there birthdays just as much as we humans do. see what i do invite my friends over with there dogs and buy like dog treats for all of them in a little party bag and i get them like a small dog toy its really Cute.|`|kv5lGrSdaa	I never did but my cousins did.

Second step: crawl gently onto his back. Since he's obviously been trained in Natural Whalemanship, you should be able to walk all over him.  Third step: gently blow a puff of air onto his blow hole while tickling under his right flipper. This should get him to roll over for you. *CAUTION*: make sure he rolls to the right, so he deposits you nicely on the pool deck.  Fourth step: Stroke his chin with your thumb and pinky finger. This will put him in a trancelike state so you can clean out his belly button.  Fifth step: Clean his belly button with one of those giant Q-tips from American Gladiators covered with Neosporin.  Sixth step *VERY IMPORTANT*: Stroke the underside of his chin with your middle and index fingers to bring him out of his trancelike state- If you forget this part, he may drown, and his mom will definitely come after you in a fit of rage- if she does so, run away and lock the door- whales grow legs when they are in danger, so she will chase after you on the pool deck.|`|tde3Aadfaa	the whale section would be under pets-fish, not the horse section. did the fish section not seem right to you? are you dunmb enough top think that you should put a whale question in the horse section? oh, and try using your own two hands, how'd it get lint in it anyway? the whale should be in the water...second thought... i don't think lint could develop in an animal that lives in the water. maybe next time you can use your brain or have extra staff so that when this happens, you don't ask strangers on the computer.|`|48Yf8tpsaa	I get someone to suck the lint out of my baby whale, dude.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	what are you thinking|`|EghHVkHEaa	I belive you may have happend across the wrong section. :]|`|DLxh9CANaa	And why is this in HERE?? It has nothing to do with horses or horse sports.  Try the " Fish" section.
AA11353999	Generally we only insure our horses who are on their way to or already competing at a national level. Horses like Beezie Madden's Authentic and Laura Kraut's Cedric are insured for major medical, loss of use, mortality, and fertility.    Major Medical: colic surgery, fractured cannon bone repair, etc.  Loss of Use: your horse becomes disabled, say s/he foundered and is only pasture sound and you're unable to show, train or even ride him/her, this part of your policy would kick in and reimburse you a percentage of your horse's worth.  Mortality: Death  Fertility: Your stallion has an awesome show record and people want to breed their mares, but he's not producing sperm. This is what happened to the TB racehorse named Cigar- wondrous race record but no love for the ladies.    Generally I don't recommend it to my clients unless their horse has REAL potential in the show ring. For the average 'back-yard horse' the cost of keeping a policy vs. actually having the need to use it is rare.|`|db9ce3362907a136acac0610fae4357eaa	There are two types of insurance that are usually covered on a horse.  The first is mortality insurance and the premiums are based on the value of the horse you want to insure times a certain percentage depending on what the horse is used for.  My current rate on my horses is about 3.6% for show horses.  The value of the horse is usually the purchase price and can be adjusted yearly for any additional training and show records accumulated.  Mortality covers in case of the death of a horse except for natural causes.  Most insurance companies will not insure a horse before it is a month old or after it is 15 years old.  The second type of insurance is major medical.  Your major medical usually runs about $250.00 a year and covers expensive medical costs.  Mine has a deductible of $1,000 then it will cover everything over that amount.    You can also get what is called "loss of use" insurance which is very expensive.  Loss of use covers just that, in the event that your horse is injured to the point that it is no longer able to perform the functions you bought it for (i.e. show horses that are cripple) they pay you the value of the horse.  Most insuarnce agencies require you to either dispose of the horse or relinquish ownership to them if you file a claim on a loss of use policy.  Most people that claim on loss of use end up selling the horse for next to nothing.    As to whether you should insure your horse or not, that depends.  I have mine insured because if something were to happen to them I would not be able to afford to replace them with a horse of equal value, it protects my investment and I can afford the premiums.  I have only had to make a cliam on a mortality policy once due to my horse dying of colic, to me the insurance is cheap compared to the amount of money I already have invested in them.    Hope this answers your question.  BTW the insurance company I use is Horse Insurance Specialists|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	You can purchase insurance on horses. The coverage is whatever you want, so depending on that, will give the cost. Your best bet is call an equine insurance company, they can give you the rates and options. I pay about $400/ yr on my 3, total of $47,000.00 . You can have colic insurance, and vet bill insurance, cancer...lot's of options.  If you have a well bred horse, that you show, it is well worth it. Not many companies will insure a backyard horse. So you really need to call around and ask.  http://livestockinsurance.biz/horse-insu...  http://www.horseinsurance.com/Pages/Home...  http://www.agririsk.com/|`|oubC3TCOaa	I never heard of such thing.  Buy a unicorn instead.|`|EghHVkHEaa	Well as for how much it costs; The only way to get an accurate answer to this question is to fill out the appropriate form and request a quote.  Premiums vary depending on the breed and age of the horse, its value, its use, etc.   Mortality coverage is similar to 'Life Insurance' and is for the value of the horse should it die. Extended coverages are available for surgery & medical coverage, as well as loss of use, infertility, or named perils.    How do you know if you really need insurance?;   Can you afford to pay an attorney to defend you in a lawsuit? Do you have the money in the bank to rebuild your barn, home or replace a horse that is valuable to you?  If you answered no to either of these questions, then YES, you really need insurance.    Insurance was originally intended to help you recover from a financial loss and pay your litigation costs. Sounds simple enough, but today, we live in a society where people are quick to place blame.  Fortunately, there are programs available to insure you and your equine activities appropriately.    And as for why i would reccomend it..    You should insure your horses to protect yourself against the possibility of losing them to various causes, which could leave you in financial distress.  Too often, unexpected incidents or medical emergencies take place that, without insurance, you may be unable to accommodate, leaving your horse to suffer or die unnecessarily.      If you've just purchased a horse, it may be a good idea to carry the optional Major Medical & Surgical in addition to the standard Mortality, just because you don't know what medical problems the horse may have. After a year, you might decide to carry just the standard Mortality.      Generally, the cost of insurance is minimal when compared to the overall costs of maintaining your horse, paying for colic surgery, or paying a lawsuit.  In fact, many times the cost of entering your horse in a show is higher than the cost of its insurance.      Hope that helps.|`|pfbIm4lEaa	Every insurance plan is different. You can get an insurance policy that will cover lameness and disease, as well as colic surgery. The cost on this can vary depending on the value of your horse as well as what options you choose. There is mortality insurance, that covers you in the case of your horse's death. There is also major medical that should cover lameness and disease. Major medical may or may not cover colic surgery, depending on the specifics of your plan. If it does not, there should be a surgical option. Loss of use insurance is also available, which would cover if your horse was permanently injured, but it is rather expensive and often not worth the cost. Here are links to a couple of places where you can get online quotes for your horse insurance. I've been through this several times for my clients, so if you have any questions, please feel free to email me. Happy shopping :)    http://www.equineinsurancecenter.com/quo...  http://www.mize-insurance.com/equine_quo...  http://horse-insurance.com/quote.html  http://www.agririsk.com/horseinsurance/e...    By the way: I pay approx $450 for my gelding on a $5500 mortality policy with major medical/colic surgery. I pay approx $700 for my mare on a $10,000 mortality and major medical/colic. The rate for them *I think* is 3.4% of value, plus $250 for medical??? And I have a $250 deductible on both. For hunter/jumper. The rate varies depending on what you want to do with your horse.|`|KVkkPqumaa	It depends on your circumstances. As an owner/ rider you would need liability, mortality and major medical. Perhaps also loss of use if you show. As a barn owner, you would need much more liability insurance and same as a trainer.    As an owner, I have liability, Mortality (up to $5000) and major medical ($7500 coverage per year). I pay $450 per year for this. My deductible is $250. This covers colic, surgery, pretty much everything. I got it through Wells Fargo and they are pretty comprehensive.     Considering that if anything big happened to my horse, I would just not have the money to cover (as things can go into the 1000's so quickly!)and would end up putting her down - I feel insurance is as important as the saddle!    I also have liability cover for up to $1000000 so if she kicks a car (Or a person) or causes damage in any way I am not personally liable.     I hope this helps!|`|xx4MSADIaa	Its insurance for a horse.|`|ndqjst7taa	It depends on what type of insurance you what to get. I have death insurance on 5 horses this covers if the horse dies from something other then natural causes  I also have insurance for the shows this is to cover if there's an accient  You ally to contact different insurance companys and see what they offer|`|H3Fs1mMMaa	You can choose what you want to be covered on your horse... the more you cover the more expensive it will be. But I think it is worth if anything was to happen to your horse you would be covered. I've had my horse for 7 years and he had to have both of his hocks injected and the insurance covered it|`|yY6Aj1xpaa	Equine Mortality Insurance...for those who have expensive show horses, or a beloved irreplaceable equine companion....for which an illness or accident has claimed these horses...    http://www.horseinsurance.com/Pages/Home...    http://www.equispec.com/archive/06.phtml    http://www.equisure-inc.com/equine/equin...

AA11570905	Look into a treeless endurance saddle.  These come in all seat sizes and will fit almost any horses.  I am very interested in getting a Bob Marshall Endurance Saddle like this one.  <a href="http://treelesssaddle.com/endurance.html" rel="nofollow">http://treelesssaddle.com/endurance.html</a><br>  <br>  I have a couple of friends who have them and love them.|`|I55JNnvpaa	it depends all on the horse. wide simply means for a wider horse, such as a draft maybe.  endurance saddles are built for long riding, and are ind of half english half western saddles. Endurance saddles are good, as long as you dont compete in them.

XRxLZYFwaa	This is what is now referred to as "separation related distress". You actually set yourself up for this, sorry to say. Because he was never ever alone when younger he never learned to deal with it. Now he doesn't know how to cope.   You have to teach him that your absence is nothing major. Give him a yummy chew toy or big bone. Go out of the room where he can't follow. When you come back in, don't make a fuss - just ignore him like your return is no big deal. Repeat this as often as possible. Make your absence unremarkable and make sure he has something to occupy him - something yummy enough to distract him. Remember never to make a fuss before leaving him or just after returning. When you return, only acknowledge him once he is calm or returns to his toy/treat. Then you can say hallo and make a fuss. This is so he learns the appropriate response.    Sad to say that you may have your work cut out for you. At his age the habit has already been formed. If you know you are going to be away for quite a while, consider giving him some rescue remedy. But do practice the technique above often. And then also seek a professional trainer/behaviourist's help.|`|4vFhrSpGaa	Separation anxiety....i don't blame you for spoiling your dog..i do but only my youngest puppy screams when I'M not home!they are to cute not to be spoiled!but i would practice leaving him alone by going into another room and keep going back and forth when he starts screaming!but my mom shows my dog a picture of me when she cries so maybe you could put a picture of you close to where he usually goes when you go out of the house.|`|hdYgdu0oaa	he is very spoiled...|`|AA10283080	When you walk away and go into another room and he starts doing that go back to him and correct him right away. You have to keep correcting him until he realizes that is unacceptable behavior and doesn't do it when he can't see you. It may take a while and a lot of walking back and forth for you but it will be worth the time when he stops doing that. If he ever does it again you must correct him....otherwise you'll just have to deal with it.|`|xTAR26Gkaa	Seperation anxiety. When you do get home, ignore him, sounds mean, but you don't want to make a big fuss about you being gone and coming home.

He must think he's being punished for something really bad.<br>  <br>  Dogs need space and stimulation! If you don't have a backyard then leave him in a safe room like the kitchen or laundry, with water, hidden treats to keep his mind active and toys. And peepads if you must, although my dogs went through the night (8 hours plus) from young puppies.|`|VMY7No0eaa	yes give him a treat outside the door... then another one ...show it to him and then put it inside the crate.<br>  How many hours are you leaving him in the crate... over 5 is too long. <br>  I would fence him in the kitchen instead. <br>  good luck|`|zL1sggpCaa	We called it "bed" and any time we wanted our pups to go in, we would show them to their kennel and tell them to "go to bed", lead them in and then give them a treat.

She'll most likely go on the newspapers, cause they really don't like to soil themselves; this method can also potty train them for you, after a while.|`|xxtrFHn6aa	The crate is probably too big. Puppies don't like to pee in the place that they have to sleep, so if the crate is too big, they will pee in one corner and lay in the other but then they probably will end up stepping in it at some point. There crate should only have enough room in it for them to sit stand lay down and turn around in, plus a bit extra. Block off a section of her crate, or buy a smaller crate, or a pet carrier instead. If your crate is already small, and this is happening, then she probably cannot hold her bladder yet.|`|FdcWPp48aa	Black Cherry Brandy got it right.  The pup is not old enough to hold it that long.  She'll get better as she gets older.  You will have to keep her clean or she'll get used to living in filth and will never improve.  Keep her and the crate clean and she will get it when she is old enough to hold it for the length of time you are leaving her.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	You can only expect your puppy to hold it 1 hour for every month she is old. Your puppy is 3 months old so that's 3 hours. She's locked up in her crate for roughly 5 hours or so. She can't hold it that long.|`|Z5CDCWj5aa	Our 7-week old puppy holds it all night in her crate after we have worked her towards this by slowly extending the length of time between taking her out.  She goes from 9pm to 7am without any barking or accidents.  The crate has to be the right size and you have to time the feeding and drinking right, as well as making sure she gets lots of attention and exercise the rest of the day, but with a little direction there is no reason why she couldn't hold it longer.  Whoever created the 1 hour per month old rule doesn't know what they are talking about.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!  I'd stay away from these forums as everyone seems to be really pushy with their opinions and unhelpful with the specific question you are asking.  She may be upset, not getting enough attention or some other problem but it is not because she's not old enough to hold it.|`|91Yx2MEyaa	that far to long for a pup to be left on its own, you wouldn't leave a baby for that long, have you really thought about the needs of this pup be for you bought it!|`|6lMFrqBgaa	She could be stressed as well.

Does she stay the night in her crate as well?|`|TcJVVurzaa	get a crate that fits your puppy (enough space to lay down) then it wont pee 'cause it wont want to lay in pee|`|w7XNcmihaa	You need to teach her how to pee outside first!|`|REO6bHEUaa	Hiya, as with many of the answers here I can tell you two things, the puppy is being left far too long on her own and not given enough toilet breaks and the crate is probably way too big.  A puppy should not poo or pee in their bed and if she is doing this then it is because the crate is big enough for her to pee/poo in one corner and relax in another.  I myself had to buy two crates for my boxer (not need now as she is  is now nearly one) as I learnt soon enough the problem with a big crate ( I thought getting a bigger one meant I did not have to buy another one when she getting older).  The crate should only be big enough for her to stand up, lie comfortably and to turn around with ease, nothing more.    The 5 hours in the afternoon is way too much for a puppy or in fact a dog to be crated. <br>  <br>  When crate/house training my dog I was lucky enough to be able to have someone look after her in the day whilst I was at work, I know this is not always easy for working people. but maybe a neighbour or friend could call or could she go to work with your mom or dad?<br>  <br>  one last thing - she has to be dragged outside because your house is probably lovely and warm and she happy poo/peeing in the warmth.  Trust me, you need to get her to toilet outside soon or she will get into bad habits.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps xx|`|fzV0R8HSaa	I think you're asking too much from this little puppy.  Her bladder is still developing and she is unable to wait 5 hrs to pee.  She needs to be allowed to relieve herself about every 2 hrs. consistently.  Also, the crate cannot be too large for the dog's present size.  As she grows you will need to replace her crate with a larger one.  Only allow enough space for the dog to stand up, turn around, and lay down.  More space than that gives her a little bathroom and it creates anxiety in the dog. Yesterday, The Dog Whisperer repeated a show on crating dogs.  Another option would be to use a small area in the house or garage where you can confine her and allow her to use wee-wee pads.  This would be more comfortable for the dogs.  If you continue to crate her as you are she will never be house broken because she will learn to live in her urine and feces as pet shop animals do. <br>  <br>  If you are crating during the day and then crating her again at night, this isn't going to help your dog become balanced.  This is considered excessive and cruel.<br>  <br>  You can't get her to pee outside because she thinks the crate is her bathroom.|`|zL1sggpCaa	5 hours sounds like it is too long to be left. <br>  <br>  SHE NEEDS TO GO! She can only hold it for so long. She is pretty young yet.<br>  <br>  As far as dragging her out, try leashing her and bringing a treat along. Reward her when she behaves correctly, by going out side and going potty. She'll catch on to the idea soon.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	my puppy does that too. how big is your crate compared to your puppy? my puppy is very small and her crate is the largest size. you might want to section it off. they usually don't go to the bathroom where they lay.<br>  <br>  if your pup is only 12 weeks, she probably can't hold it for more than a couple seconds to minutes.
u61yKsE3aa	You can always keep fish with them just know they will eventually eat the fish.  You can also keep small frogs or salamanders (as long as non toxic) but again eventually your turtles will prolly eat these as well.  If you have a huge proper set up I have seen people set up room size cages that have turtles in a pond area and large lizards on the land space both were tropical.  This should only be done if you know what you are doing and make sure each has what they need to be healthy and happy.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	They like plants more than other animals. I have 3 turtles and because they are young and do not eat live fish yet, they live with 7 goldfish in their tank. The like to have plants to hide in and rocks to lay on that are completely out of the water. That would probably be the best thing to put in the tank with them.|`|5765d15bf5b7da6026f760e75cea316faa	You should not put any other animals in the tank with them.|`|wanG4pndaa	Well.. let me see.

They won't touch a cricket anymore.|`|N70orPJ6aa	Super worms should not bed to dragons under 16 inches. In young dragons they have a high risk of impacting the digestive system. Also, super worms can not make up a staple diet. They are fattening and if fed too much can cause blockage even in the largest dragons. <br>  <br>  Anyway, Bearded Dragons will not over eat, when they are full, they will simply not eat anymore. You are supposed to feed crickets to them 3 times a day as many as they can eat each time. Crickets should be used instead of super worms. You can give about 4-6 super worms every other to every 2 days if you want to give them as a treat. There are much better worms available though, if you want to use them more than crickets. I suggest you look into getting Phoenix worms. They are not fattening, high in calcium and can be used daily. They are also soft bodied meaning no impactions.|`|f8t4FQZ5aa	It is not recommended to use superworms as a staple diet (daily). The chitin is not so much of an issue with larger dragons (unless grossly overfed) it is more the fact that they are extremely high in fat. Dragon love their worms and if fed only worms they will eventually turn their noses up to other live prey.  It is always best to offer a varied diet not only with greens and vegetables but live prey as well. Dragons WILL over eat especially items like worms. Many  will eat extremely large quantities of worms if they are available and this is where the chitin has the potential to cause issues.   It is really not necessary to know when your "dragon is full", it is more important that it be provided a reasonable amount of varied and acceptable foods daily.<br>  htp://www.westcoastdragons.com

u61yKsE3aa	If you are new to reptile ownership a chameleon is not the best place to start.  Chameleons are an intermediate level herp.  However the best one to start with would be a veiled or a panther.  Both are larger and tend to be hardier.  I would make sure that you get healthy, captive-bred adult.  Adults are more hardy and captive bred will have less risk of parasites and should adjust to new surrounds more easily.  When picking your chameleon pick one that is alert and active.  There should be no discharge of any kind any where and the person you buy from should be knowledgeable and able to answer any questions you ask such as feeding habits, shedding cycle, etc.  Good luck and Have Fun.|`|3IUMh4Igaa	A veiled would be the best. They are the heartiest and can cope with mistakes a little better. They also handle normal household stresses better.|`|7be42b69f2b9dd61df940310f2d2e055aa	Do your research and follow everything. I wouldn't get into owning them unless you are really committed and have some previous experience with other reptiles. Now, by far the Panther Chameleon is the best beginner chameleon. They are the hardiest, and can take handling better than the other species. While they are much more expensive than most others, it makes up for it when you have a full grown male. While I have heard Jackson's are not the best by any means, I have had great success with them. I own 3 and they are very hearty and allow me to handle them all the time with very litle complaint. I would start with a Jackson's and move up to a Panther. They all have differnet care techniques, so be sure to do your research. Good Luck!

You don't need to be stuck with one breed, you might see a lot of lovely dogs at the shelter to chose from. I am highly against buying dogs from a puppie store, sometimes breeders might be better but even they could be "puppy mills" and I wouldnt support them.....GO shelter!! :))  Best of luck!
iy3NISVGaa	I am sorry but you sound rather young and naive: to start this kind of business requires sound financial backing, years of expertise and the right premises.<br>  <br>  Having a file of bankruptcy against your name will stop you (especially in the current financial climate) from getting a loan or any assistance from the bank, especially as you have no collateral such as land or such of your own.<br>  <br>  The only way you could possibly think of doing this would be to lease a yard which is up and running now, where the income is good enough to cover all costs, taxes and staff wages: But a successful business like this does not come up for rent so often, and you would have competition from other experienced interested parties who have no bad credit references:<br>  <br>  As a landlord, I am sorry to say, for me, you would not be the successful candidate:<br>  It is very sad when circumstances, very often not their own fault, force people to file for bankruptcy: This has mostly nothing to do with bad management of funds, or a thing of which one should be ashamed.

It'll take years and years to rebuild your (Mum's) credit rating, that'll have to be done slowly and carefully with the extremely high interest credit cards she might be able to get (but she will be penalised with the interest rate and she'll get stung if she's late on a payment) not by undertaking business loans for presumably tens of thousands.<br>  <br>  If you have a dream to open a riding school - excellent, I wish you all the best and I do hope you can do it.  But the way to do it is to get a good all-round education (riding schools need maths and English!) and get as much experience with horses as you can.  Be prepared to work all the hours in the day for below minimum wage as a working pupil and hopefully you'll have a good employer who'll help you through the BHS stages so you can get your AI - people will want a well trained instructor and without at least the AI you're not going to be able to build a reputation.<br>  <br>  Horses are not a profitable business; for now, until you finish your education and can start working towards instruction, why not support your Mum in finding a more reliable way to make money?|`|brVS3Pg0aa	riding skool is not a good idea, insurance reasons, insurance is over a grand a month, and u can still get in trouble.

0m6BgESXaa	She's under-stimulated most likely.  A physically and mentally tired dog won't bother you in such a manner.<br>  <br>  Try playing more games with her, and tire her out.  Games that make her think, like scent discrimination. tracking, more formal obedience, or different tricks.  Get her thinking :-)<br>  <br>  It's not dominance, but she is being a little pushy.  Take advantage of the drive she seems to be showing you.  Dogs that are drivey want to work, and thus are easier to train ^_^<br>  <br>  Are you positive it's growling?  Or was it grumbling?<br>  <br>  Vocal dogs have quite a few nuances in their throat tones, and some people may misconstrue a warble for a growl.  My Shepherd makes all sorts of awkward noises and people say "Why do you let him growl at you?!"<br>  <br>  The answer is that I don't.  I know my dog and know the difference.<br>  <br>  Don't ever physically correct your dog for growling, or tell them to hush.  You can inadvertently remove an important warning signal from your dog.<br>  <br>  Instead make the dog work for you.  Sit, down, stand, watch, shake, beg, play dead, etc.  The dog should not be allowed to control the situation.  That's your job|`|7uznrLBXaa	She's bored.  Puppies need a lot of stimulation.  You need to exericise/play with her more, and yes, continue to discipline her when she barks for attention.  <br>  <br>  For inappropriate barking I put my dogs in "time out" when they bark for attention.  It is a quiet corner in a quiet, lonely room.  If she knows "sit" and "stay", you might try this.  It works for my dogs because it gives them the opposite of what they want.  I've found that responding to the barking, even with a stern "no" doesn't work because it's just more attention!  My dogs bark inappropriately when someone else comes over, and they feel the guest should be fawning all over them.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	She wants attention. She is probably bored and wants you to play with her. When she barks like this tell her no and then play with her a minute or two later. This way she will not realize her barking for attention is actually working.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	she is talking back! ha she is still a baby and is trying to communicate with you<br>  <br>  mine is 10 months old and every now and then he barks and makes funny noises to me and i just say "oh ya?" and he gets it out of his systems|`|eznL5Zwvaa	Keep telling her no in a firm voice.She will get the idea you are not happy with this behavior.Always be consistant,do not let her away with it because you or someone thinks its cute.Pit-bulls are very smart,she is just trying to get your attention.You need to let her know that is not how to do it.Good Luck.|`|tTntRZNDaa	Generally, there are eight reasons why dogs bark:<br>  <br>      * Territorial or defensive barking<br>      * Excitement, or happiness at seeing you<br>      * Play and exercise<br>      * To get your attention or to signal you (i.e. "I have to go potty!")<br>      * Aggravation over not being able to attain something (such as your pork chop).<br>      * Social barking in response to other dogs<br>      * Separation anxiety and trepidation<br>      * Compulsive behavior <br>  <br>  Check this link for more info.<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/barking-aspca.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/barking-aspca.html</a>|`|rtQ6LEuiaa	She might want to just play.  My puppy use to do that, not just to me, but also the other dog we have because she wanted to play, so that is a possibility in your case too.|`|w7XNcmihaa	She wants attention! If you get up, she might lead you somewhere! That's what my dog does, he barks to get attention and I follow him and he usually leads me to the cabinet for a treat! <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!<br>  :)|`|kvHqnR5Haa	She may just be bored and looking for you to play with her.  Get down and play with her and keep her active.  Take her for a walk!|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Indeed, she is asking for attention, she wants to play - BUT DON"T. Why ? Because then she learns how to manipulate you - bark, and I will get what I want. You can do one of two things. Ignore her, even if she continues for an hour. Put some ear plugs in if you need to. But she must learn that it will not help to bark<br>  The second thing you can do is to start teaching her to speak on command. Use clicker training. When she barks, click and treat. Later on, add the command "speak". Then also start to click and treat the moment she keeps quiet. Add a command like "silent" Read more on clicker training on my site.|`|xxtrFHn6aa	Like everyone else has said, probally just for attention. But if you want it to be able to get her to stop when barking is unwanted, then you have to train her. <br>  <br>  Get her barking continously, even if you have to bark at her yourself, and then say your command loudy, like 'STOP' or 'QUIET'. You will frighten her and she will stop barking, as soon as she stops, give her a treat and praise her!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
wbZp6ZcPaa	Sounds like a training issue or something similar. I would contact a trainer in your area and work with the trainer and the dog to resolve the issue. Good luck!|`|kCt1SL5Zaa	It could be a psychological as well as a training problem. Peeing forever may be a health problem as well ! See a vet and ask him about training and emotional issues!

We love our dogs!!!!|`|IqtN47Puaa	Whatever you choose out of this bunch of answers, please note your dog is reacting to anxiety already ( shows by peeing when excited, scared, new people, etc).

For awhile I thought it was behavioral but, after several urinary tests and vet visits, we determined she was incontinant.  My vet prescribed Proin and she immediately stopped peeing in the house.<br>  So it can be any number of factors, but I'd recommend getting a urine sample and having your vet check it out to rule out that it could be a urinary tract infection.  If it isn't that, there's a good possibility that it's incontinance.|`|2F0IclLUaa	Get PeePee Pads. They sell them at ShopRite, WalGreens, and maybe Target and Cvs. Cvs should have them! And if PeePee PAds don't work then EVERY TIME he does go pee in your house, you say BAD BOY YOU ARE A BAD BOY! YOU DON"T GO PEE PEE IN THE HOUSE!!!!!!!! and let him stay out for like 10-15 minutes!|`|mjKIV9Toaa	So, it tries to make him get used to the litter, or to a newspaper on the floor.<br>  If it doesn't work so, I don't know you to say.<br>  <br>  Excuse for the errors, i am Italian.
e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	It may still be adjusting to its new home.  Have you been handling it since you got it?  Snakes need time to adjust to their surroundings, and if they are too stressed out, they will refuse food.    Also check to make sure your temperatures are adequate, snakes that are too cold may refuse food as well.    Double check his environment, leave him alone for a couple days and try again.|`|nooi0ldjaa	he might still be getting used to his new home, snakes take a while to get used to things. your temps might be to low, he might just not be hungry...if he still hasn't eaten in 2 or 3 more days consider takeing him to the vet.    leave him alone for a while, don't take him out, tap on the cage etc etc as you might just stress him out more.|`|FPaJ1AU0aa	Maybe he's starting to shed?    Sometimes snakes stop eating while theyre shedding.    I would wait until the petshop you got him from is open again, and go and ask them for advice.|`|nZBVbVbkaa	Im no expert on snakes (yet!) but, ive noticed at the pet shop i go to, they write down the dates when they feed their snakes, and they are up to and over a month apart at times. So it could be he needs adjusting to its new home, but he may just not want to eat either, considering he was fed just before you took him home with you.    Hope the little guy comes around for you soon, and email me with what happens if you like|`|vZFLG75Zaa	Since they have already fed him... he probably isnt hungry.  Most snakes go for a few days after a meal.  And he is just adjusting to his new surroundings.  Give him a few days and try again.|`|bkO4WARjaa	I wouldn't be too worried about it just yet.  snakes can be picky, especially while they are trying to get used to their new surroundings.  Make sure your temp is right, and that he has a hide on the cool side and the warm side of the tank. If he doesn't feel secure yet, he won't eat.  If he is little, empty toilet paper rolls make great hides.  Have you been handling him much lately?  With a new snake it's best to wait at least a few days before handling him. Also, if he is shedding he might refuse to eat.  Wait a few days and try again. If you don't have any luck next time, wait a couple more days and try feeding him in his cage.  (Make sure to put the pinky on paper towel or some kind of tray in the cage so that your bedding doesnt stick to it.)  Make sure it is quiet in the room when feeding. Try just leaving him in the cage with his food and dont peek for an hour. Good luck.|`|oDaQU3pCaa	snakes have to adjust to new environments and this takes anywhere from a week to a whole month. just keep trying to feed it weekly and it will eat soon. another thing is it might be about to shed but my money is on the fact that it is still adjusting =)
Rfj2ULibaa	Yes, they will fight, probably to the death.  Tempting as it may be to put them together, please don't.|`|rNJVcq4Daa	NO do not put them in the same cage they will kill each other. It is a very bad idea and in the end you will end up with one or no hamsters. Keep them in separate cages and never put them together.|`|lFdWmDjGaa	Yes the hamsters will definitely fight!

wbZp6ZcPaa	Are you sure that the puppy doesn't need to go outside at that time? Everyone I know that crate trained their dog (mine has never been crated) either put the crate in a random room (like the living room or dining room) or in their bedroom at night. So I would suggest moving the crate to a room that's quiet at night. Good luck!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	For the first few nights after we got our puppy, we had her in another room because she cried all night.  After she got used to the crate, we moved her in with us.  She sleeps next to the bed.  I'm not sure what you mean by separating him when he's older, but I think it's fine to keep him close.  Also, keep him in the crate all night, that way he will learn to have bladder control and won't think he can go out at all hours of the night.  He'll get used to it soon.  Good luck!|`|8iHbDmHmaa	Where is he now?  If he's used to sleeping in your room, he may miss you the first couple nights.  He'll probably get used to the sound.<br>  <br>  Because he's still so young, you'll want him nearby so you can hear him if he has to go out during the night. <br>  <br>  You could get a fan or humidifier or something like a white noise machine to put near him.  The sound will drown out other noises that may wake him up.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	We put our puppy's crate at the foot of our bed. She has abandonment issues and likes to be as close to us as possible. (She was found alone with no collar or tags on a beach and the person that found her took her to the shelter we adopted her from.) We started out with her crate on the other side of our rom but she fussed so much. So I read on a website to put it as close to us as possible and it helped so much.|`|oo2Hqqanaa	The best place to put the crate is where it will finally be. That place in your house will be his sanctuary. Just remember the rule, for each month of age, one hour in the crate without a "potty break".|`|FdcWPp48aa	He should be crated in your bedroom.  Being close to you will give him comfort and will help him bond to you.<br>  <br>  Here is a step by step guide to crate training:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogscouts1.com/uploads/Crate_training_step_by_step.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogscouts1.com/uploads/Crate_...</a>|`|OOsP9Kopaa	I say letting him know the source of the Noise will help. The boiler suddenly kicking on and him not knowing what it is, and he trapped in a crate that's probably scary for him. Or move the crate to room where he can't here the boiler.<br>  I don't know if moving the crate will disrupt your puppy. We don't put our dogs in crates; they are too big. Maybe it will help if you leave him out of the crate so he does not feel cornered, but he might tear things up . <br>  Personal I don't like crates because they make the dog feel trapped; like they can't run or fight if they're in danger. Some dogs crates work with others the don't. I think a big part is how safe your dog feels in it's own home and around strangers. Don't put your dog in the crate when it feels scared, put it in the yard; so he knows he could run or fight if he need to. Put your dog in the crate when it misbehaves. If you put him in the crate when he's scared he will think of the crate as dangerous.

mFf8CqAraa	How to Make Cat Repellent<br>  <br>  If you have trouble with unwanted cats in your yard, there are several methods you can use to repel them. While there are many commercial products available to deter cats, trying some simple homemade repellents first may save money and be just as effective.<br>  <br>  Step1) If you notice that visiting cats prefer a particular part of your yard, try sprinkling the area with cayenne pepper, coffee grounds, peppermint oil or eucalyptus oil. Cats will avoid these scents. Cats also do not care for citrus, so you could try placing orange or lemon peels in targeted areas or spraying citronella oil. You may create a boundary around your yard by using these repellents on the perimeter. <br>  <br>  Step2) Make it more difficult for cats to enter your yard. Fence areas that are open, or string a wire a few inches above the top of fencing so that cats have difficulty walking along it. <br>  <br>  Step3) Try planting cat-deterring foliage, such as coleus canina or rue. If you have a bird feeder, place cuttings from thorny plants underneath to discourage cats from approaching. <br>  <br>  Step4) If home remedies do not prove effective, you can try commercial products. There are powders and sprays available, as well as ultrasonic alarms triggered by motion sensors.|`|O71xlcG3aa	You need to call animal control and report her.  They will file charges on her for animal neglect and they will also catch the cats and take them to the humane society.  Or if you can catch them you could find them a owner on Craigslist or something like that.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	What you should do is call animal control and report her!  Tell them that she has moved and let all the cats there and they are creating a problem in the neighborhood.  If nothing else, call the SPCA and see if you can get them to come trap them and remove them.<br>  <br>  It will be better for the cats.  And you should have more control over your dogs that to allow them to work themselves up into such a frenzy over a cat.|`|rLRid8NEaa	She just let them free? That isn't fair. I would try to round them up and bring them to a shelter. Or call Animal Control. It would be best for your dogs. That's really dangerous too, because the cats can get really hurt. Don't police men see that? Either call the police, Animal Control, or round them up and bring them to a shelter. I think thats best.|`|3b8384b9a301d00c1a1f9851c0b2c058aa	if I were you I'd call Animal Control!<br>  <br>  please answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApR5dErMHOHwm5FgbN1kX37sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225133856AACAgFG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|QC6oBb2iaa	The only thing that will really be effective is to have a cat rescue agency come and trap them (HUMANELY!!).  Any method of preventing them from coming around your yard would have to be repeated frequently, and would need to include all of the neighbors around you, as well.  <br>  <br>  One option is to put out sprinklers with motion detectors on them, but this isn't effective if you live in an area with freezing weather.

JiCKFTuIaa	In general Labs are a happy go lucky breed, but remember that they are the most purpose bred breed on the planet. Those that are breeding seeing eye dogs are looking for a completely different set of traits than a person breeding hunting dogs, or search & rescue dogs, or ---- and on it goes.  Then too the quality of Lab breedings can be all over the place. Any time a breeder is breeding only for color the quality can only go down, and each generation becomes worse.  But, there are enough quality Lab breeders around that there is no excuse for buying a poorly bred Labrador. Just do your homework before you buy.  As far as different colors having different personalities, it depends. A poorly bred black Lab can bite just as hard as a poorly bred chocolate Lab. You will see far more difference between field bred and show bred than anything else.    As far as there only being three different colors of Labs,   ah - OK    As soon as someone says that something is impossible, ma nature will prove them wrong.  http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/...  Instead of being BBee "Spot" is BBEee, having one extra gene|`|PM23RDycaa	No difference whatsoever. A well bred lab is the same no matter the color.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It all depends on the breeding.  Chocolate labs are often only bred for their color rather than because the dog is good quality & health clearances. You should only buy a dog with health testing done esp. hips on a lab & be able to see the line at least 5 generations back. Choc also have a much smaller gene pool & you can get a dog with a lot of health issues.|`|Za8DpfvQaa	All labs have the same temperament--But all puppies have different personalities.    I personally prefer Chocolate Labs.    Good Luck!|`|W0buucLsaa	Not if you're getting one from a reputable breeder; color has no effect on temperament. If it's a back yard breeder, I'd say: get neither because they're both probably going to be hyper.    Black labs were really popular in the late 80's and early 90's, and chocolate labs were really popular in the late 90's and early 00's. So idiot back yard breeders bred them badly (for desired COLOR *rolls eyes*) and it resulted in a lot of temperament issues, not the least of which is being INSANE and HYPER. This is why you see a lot more black and brown labs with temperament issues than yellow labs - because the yellows never got popular enough for morons to intentionally breed that desired color for money.    (Guys, the lab temperament is NOT supposed to be hyperactive. That's bad breeding.     And there are only 3 colors: yellow, black, brown. That's it. No such thing as a white or silver lab.)|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Nope! Both have the exact same temperament because they're the same breed. Golden Retrievers on the other hand can have different temperaments because they are a different breed. This is like saying that a Pug that is black will be meaner than a Pug that is tan. It's just not true!    I have been around every color of lab (except silver). I know a chocolate lab who is the sweetest boy I've ever seen! He's really playful and LOVES me. Whenever I see him his whole butt shakes as he wags his tail, his tongue hangs out, and he jumps up all over the place. I have never seen a difference between him and my cousin's black lab. The black lab does the same exact thing when he sees my mom. (He loved her!) I never saw aggressive tendencies in either except somewhat in the black one when playing rough tug-of-war. (I never played tug-of-war with the chocolate one since he was younger and I didn't see him all the time making him see me more as a playmate. Never a good idea to play that game with a "playmate"!)     So it really doesn't matter. But I would say get a black lab because there's a thing called the "Black Dog Syndrome". For some reason people shy away from black dogs and they don't get adopted. Some people think they believe sub-consciously that they are like black cats-unlucky and mean. Which isn't true at all but it's happening! So get a black one!    Good luck!|`|5dd6834efa64d7d372fc26ad42e3911eaa	All labs, yellow, chocolate, black, and even the rarer colors such as white and blue, generally have the same temperment.  However, just like with any breed, each one has its own personality.  Make sure you meet both parents to make sure the puppy your going to buy has a good temperment, especially if you have young children and/or other pets.|`|xTAR26Gkaa	It's all in how you raise them, but from personal experience I've noticed that black labs seem a little more docile, but I doubt it's just because they're black. Just train them from an early age!|`|kvYgopThaa	Labs are very curious hyper dogs, but are very loyal and friendly. overall they are good dogs. there is no diference between a chocolate lab and black lab. Its just a matter of preference of the color of thier coat.|`|O1y1IGxraa	I breed Labs and theres not much of a diff. just that a Chocolate is more protective people might confuse that with aggression.I am a licensed breeder|`|ecYNiE0maa	Not True good luck with your new pup whatever color you choose|`|zQdYBoSpaa	No dog is meaner than another dog. Its all in how you raise the dog. If your mean to it it will be mean back. If your nice to it and treat it well it will do the same. No matter what dog you get you must be the master of it or it will not obey you and it will be mean. Just choose which ever dog type you like more and all labs are very nice dogs.|`|yh86tDOCaa	I have a chocolate lab Lulu and she is the most kind hearted dog ever! I also have a pomeranian that is 4 pounds and a 2 year old and Lulu is great with both of them. I honestly couldn't ask for a better dog. As for the black labs my brother and neighbor have them and they seem nice too, but chocolate labs are not mean in any way.|`|6a0cd0391065cc81ea4518dae3754040aa	Temperament is completely unrelated to color in all dogs, not just Labradors. Labradors in particular are usually wonderfully friendly dogs, and are pretty consistently rated as the best kind of companion dogs, particularly around small children.     Temperament is mostly influenced by breeding (ask to meet the parents of any puppies you consider, if it's possible) and rearing (if you're kind and consistent in training the puppy once he's yours, he should be kind and well-behaved).     When you pick your puppy, pick the one with the gentlest parents, and who is friendliest to you and whatever friends or family are with you when you meet him.     I'd also advise getting a puppy from a shelter or a reputable breeder, rather than a pet store. Pet stores can be traumatic places for puppies, which can be a hazard to good temperament, and the conditions they're in before you bring them home can be hazardous to future health or training. For example, puppies in pet stores may be improperly vaccinated. They also tend to be allowed to urinate or defecate in their enclosures, which can cause confusion about proper places to do those things and create long-term housebreaking issues. You also have no way of knowing how the puppies have been handled by the staff or by other customers who've looked at them, which leaves open worrisome possibilities regarding mistreatment. A shelter is usually better about its treatment and training of animals, and will usually have staff supervising other prospective adopters; they'll also have veterinary references, so that you can be sure of the puppy's health and vaccination history. (Though shelter pups will usually only have one parent on the premises, if indeed any parents at all.) A reputable breeder will have one or both parents on-site for you to meet, will have hand-reared the pups for proper socializing, will be able to provide veterinary references and often will have laid the groundwork for housebreaking.     Good luck in choosing your puppy! And great choice on the breed!

iLrp65oXaa	It may be a simple surgery, but it is an expensive one.  Three people I work with have had their dogs tear their ACLs this winter.  It costs abut $2000 in my area for the surgery.  I would make sure you have money in place or apply for some sort of credit.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Sometimes they have to sedate depending on how well your dog is taking to being xrayed.  Check out this link - it has very good info from a vet hospital on repairing ACL tear surgery & what is involved.  Hope your dog recovers without surgery.    http://www.thepetcenter.com/sur/ACL.html|`|yFmxQlrNaa	Hi, I've been through this with two of my dogs.  Mine are beagles and they had to be sedated for the x-ray, plus while sedated the vet can manipulate the knee better without the dog feeling it.  But, if your dog is able to sit/lay still then no sedation is necessary.  With my first dog, we opted for the surgery.  The vet told us $800 and it ended up being $1400.  He was 9 and it took him a long time to heal.  I had to hold him up just to poop, carry him in and out of the house and up and down stairs etc.  Plus he was on a lot of pain meds.  About 3 years later his other knee blew from all the strain (plus he had anal cancer) so we had to put him down.  I'm glad we had the surgery, but it was a hard couple of months through the recovery period.  With our second dog (8 yrs old), (different vet) we opted for the wait and see approach.  He told us that a lot of these injuries will heal within a year if you can keep the dog relatively quiet.  (I have three beagles and 3 cats, so quiet is hard).  Anyway, I also put him on bone and joint building herbs.  After about 3 months on those he was doing a TON better.  Then I noticed anal cancer in him.  I took him off the bone and joint herbs and put him on Paw Paw Cell Reg (natures sunshine) for the cancer.  After only one bottle (one month) his cancer was gone (per visual and digital rectal exam- I had no testing done) and now he no longer limps at all.  I asked my Natural Health Practitioner why the pawpaw seemed to help and she said that some cancers are caused by viruses & parasites and pawpaw kills both.  He is now able to chase rabbits, go for walks and is back to playing with the other animals and running through 2 feet of snow with no problems!  With this dog, I'm glad that I took this approach.  Good luck on your choice, I would get two or three opinions before making a decision though.  Dab :)

tPGxPDvBaa	Animals will attack & pick on another animal they know & sense is weak or ill or elderly as in the case of your dog.  He probably doesn't sense them well enough to avoid them & they are taking advantage of his ailments.  The best you can do is separate them, keeping a close eye & he would do better anyway in smaller more secure area.  I have seen plenty of elderly dogs & cats injure themselves accidentally cuz they couldn't see or hear well enough to avoid mishaps- some very serious.|`|vJ0NhNXcaa	I'm suprised you were even able to raise a Jack Russel Terrier with other cats. Jack Russel Terriers are hunting dogs. They usually go after cats and usually do not get along with other pets. If your dog is much older than the cats it may be that the cats feel as though the dog is a toy and it is fun for them to play with him. I would suggest keeping the animals separated because your dog is too old to be beat up by younger cats.|`|W4BvABL6aa	They sense that the odds have finally swang into their favor, after the fear imposed upon them For Years.

5M57TTfpaa	The ears can move to the front, rear and side. They allow the horse to ‘focus’ on the location of a noise and usually different ear positions can mean different things.

They are very playful, cute, and they love their people. However, you have to keep their cages super-clean or they smell to high heaven. Also, when you let them run loose, they love to hide in places where you can't reach them, so it's best to confine them to one room with no hiding places when you play with them. Their feeding requirements are easy, they love toys, and we always had lots of fun with ours.

Cute and fuzzy and tons of fun to pay with and cuddle (if your ferret lets you cuddle him/her)<br>  BUT they are MORE WORK than BOTH dogs and cats!!! you not only have to train them like a puppy (and most times they do what they want anyway) but you also have to Ferret proof your whole house, that means no little cracks or spaces they can get into, sealing off rooms that have hazards (like the kitchen laundry rooms or any room that can be dangerous to them as they love to go where they shouldn't)<br>  They can be litter box trained and are housed in cages. BUT THEY ARE NOT CAGE ANIMALS!!! You can't leave a ferret in the cage 24/7 they MUST get a Minimum of 3-4 hours of out of cage play time EVERY DAY!!!! and it must be supervised as they can do things you didn't think possible for a 3-4 pound fuzzball, like finding a way over or around any blockade you put up getting under or INTO your furniture, walls, bags, wallet and then they like to steal and stash what they find (funny but can be annoying when you are trying to leave for work/school and your ferret stole and hid your keys) <br>  They also must be taken to regular vet visits and MUST have rabbies and distemper vaccinations. If your ferret eats something they shouldn't or gets sick (they are very prone to certain diseases) the vet bills can easily exceed $1000-$2000 for a single surgery. You will need to find a vet that specailzes in ferrets as well, most vets treat cats and dogs and are not trained to treat ferrets properly. Ferrets are considered exotic animals (so the visit cost more than the same visit for a dog/cat) <br>  They need all the basic grooming a dog/cat needs Weekly to monthly nail clippings, ear cleanings, teeth brushing. Brushing (fur) is minimal and so is bathing. Even though ferrets do have an odor giving them frequent baths does NOT eliminate the smell it makes it WORSE as the oils in its glands are produced to keep the coat soft and shinny washing wipes away the oils and the glands go into overdrive to make up for the lost oils and that is when the smell gets stronger. <br>  Simply put FERRETS ARE A LOT OF WORK AND TAKE TONS OF RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR PROPERLY!!!! Getting a ferret is a 6 to 10 year commitment 3-4 hours EVERY DAY. Do your research BEFORE you adopt/buy one there are way too many abandoned ferrets sitting in shelters or left to die on the streets because someone though they were cute but had no idea how much work they really are.
px27V5N9aa	King would be the Make.   That's my guess.  The model would be a number or letters with numbers  eg.  SR-25L    If the maker "King" put out a number of different styles of trailer  eg.   King Rancher,  King Sublite, King Sierra, etc...  Then "rancher", "sublite" or other 'names' would be the model.    :Missing title/registration  To register you may have to go through the police and fill out a form so they can run a check on the VIN, then you can go to the DMV to get registered.    Just my guess|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	WOW  King is a nice trailer, last forever. King is the make of the trailer.  But, to the best of my knowledge, they stopped making King trailers over 20 years ago.(Unless the KINGSTON trailers are the "new" ones).  You can go to the Motor Vehicle Dept and get a lost title application. Take the VIN  (vehicle Identification number, should be from 9-12 letters/numbers). You may have to take the application to who you bought it from, to sign it.  **I personally would not say it is homemade.. you bought it from the "government" and if they did their part, they have notified the motor vehicle department of the sale.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Just register it as a shop made trailer. We've done that with old trailers. It still gets the same tags, etc, it's just easier when all that documentation is lost.|`|xKHeYmQJaa	Easy enough.  Since you didn't transfer registration, the trailer is still registered to the City of Calgary.  How many do you think would still be registered?    If your trailer is like mine and has no VIN Plate, you're gonna have to have help from the City office.  They can pinpoint which one, if more than one is still in their records, is the one you got.  And they might even be able to scrounge up a copy of the Bill of Sale (or Receipt)!    If they are helpful, make sure you go back later with baked goods!
9qdyyyINaa	My answer comes from a first time lab owner, and our lab is also exactly 6 months of age. She now has her adult teeth and we just had her spayed yesterday.  all i can say is the more we exercise her, the more well behaved and mellow she is in the house, especially when we have company. She is only outside when we are running her around, playing ball, or walking her. A few times we have tied her out unattended for about 15 minutes, and yes she dug up the yard. Labs want and need to be with people. We have about 15 to 20 different toys for her to chew on. The only time she has ever chewed on something she was not supposed to was when we were not looking, or not watching her for more that a few minutes. Labs are smart, and they know how to get your attention, one way is to pick up something that they know they are not supposed to have. I would not recommend tieing out a lab unattended for a long period of time.  Had a friend tell us a story of a friends lab that was tied out all day and chewed through a picnic table to get loose.|`|pnX13FPgaa	you need to take him out to a local field or a new place with new things for him to do its obvious his bored of the garden and tying him up is definitely a no u should never tie a dog up it will only make them more determined to be naughty when they are not on it!! but saying that labradors a known for there playfullness and are known to be naughty unless trained properly|`|QXRrJPHqaa	sounds like a normal labrador who ended up with an owner who DIDNT do any research on his breed before buying him.  this is what lab puppies do -- they are KNOWN WORLDWIDE for this crazy puppy antics... hence the marley and me MOVIE they made about it!   He sounds like he is NOT getting enough exercise or mental stimulation.    he needs to be taken to a lake and allowed to swim or walked for a good hour a day at least.... to tire him.  this is your fault,you made an impulse purchase.  tying him up will make it worse and make him go crazy!|`|aCqSF87Raa	It's called "teething" and "excess energy." All puppies have it.    If your dog is destroying the yard then that's a sign that he's BORED of the yard. So bring him in the house and only let him out when supervised.    He's chewing because his teeth hurt and are falling out. He NEEDS to chew. If he's given the chance to chew something new or more exciting, he will. Again, put him in a crate with a Kong or Nylabone (nothing he can swallow or chew to pieces) when you can't watch him and you won't have ruined items in the yard or home.    He also needs proper exercise - long daily walks. Not just romps in the yard. Dogs are traveling animals that need to move in new or different environments - imagine if you were only allowed to run around your living room and kitchen! You'd go nuts.    now is also the perfect time to introduce obedience training. If you're having difficulties, enroll in a group puppy class.
f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Take her to the vet and get her spayed now.. She is far too immature physically and mentally.. to have a litter of puppies. When females are in heat, they should NEVER be left unsupervised in the yard.. Cause the CHIHUAHUA up the street will come and breed her.<br>  <br>  Acting different might be related to having been in heat.. Dogs do not get morning sickness.. She may or may not be pregnant.. The vet can tell you.. after he spays her.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Your vet can, we can't. Have her spayed as planned.|`|qapJU3tMaa	Don't worry about pups.  Your vet will abort her when she's spayed.  Your vet CAN spay her while she's in heat, just cost a bit extra.  Your dog's stomach will not start swelling this early if she's pregnant, nor do dogs get morning sickness.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Maybe take the dog to a vet and find out if your PUPPY is pregnant. It was very irresponsible on your part to let an known dog in heat to be unsupervised.|`|7gyvOQMWaa	It sounds like yes but I would say take her to the vet and they would definitely know. Once she has her litter (if she is pregnant) definitely get her spayed! so it doesnt happen again|`|16XpYCBmaa	Well most vets will not spay her now and if it has been a few weeks I think that is to far along to abort the puppies. There is a very good chance she is pregnant. What you will all notice is weight gain, her nipples will get bigger and fill up with milk, and she may become more clingy and attached to you. But to know for sure I would take her to the vet and find out for sure since she is still young and a small dog. She could also be having a false pregnancy and they will act just like they are pregnant. My dog had one a few months ago and I thought she was pregnant but turns out if was a false one. Also throwing up is not a good sign so I would just call the vet and talk to them.
8i90ov0Gaa	Yes, the rolling was basically shock from the temperature being too extreme. What you thought was warm was probably too hot for the snake. Next time, try water around 80 degrees, which feels just slightly warm to us.|`|2ZG1Bu9saa	Yes they can. They are very sensitive to heat changes. It is better if you slowly put them into the dish.|`|4hFT5JcLaa	Were you trying to bathe it because it was dirty or what? Some balls like to soak in water and some don't. The ones that do will generally crawl into the dish on their own. If you're going to force him to have any kind of contact with water (such as cleaning him), make sure the water is not too hot or cold. Water that is about the same temperature as your skin (doesn't feel cold or hot) is probably the best, and using a wet rag to wash him is better than submerging him.<br>  <br>  Remember that they are cold blooded, and so they don't have a "base resistance" to heat to heat like we do (about 98 degrees F). Part of the reason they like being held by us, is because we are warm to them and it feels good. If the water felt warm to you, it might have felt hot to him. Just somethings to keep in mind.|`|5Wuoi5bsaa	like mustang 75044 said put them in slowly because they are sensitive to temperature changes. I would just let the snake go into the bowl when it ready. Make sure the temperature of the cage is about the same to the water so its used to it.
PSiNv7gUaa	It would be fine to feed them fish, just steer clear of goldfish, as goldfish are treated with copper sulfides that can build up in the liver/kidneys of turtles.  I have owned and cared for many snapping turtles, and they actually have a quite varied diet that, believe it or not, includes plants.  All of the young ones I've ever had have been fed a diet of commercial pellets, live minnows (appropriately sized), live snails and anacharis plants from the local pet store.  You can also feed them worms, crickets, bits of chicked, etc.|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	yes, they love fish. dont give them anything bigger than them tho cus they might choke. u might wanna try  guppies or sumthin if theyr really tiny. the more they eat the healthier they are and the faster they will grow. also they like a variety of foods. mealworms and crikets are good. they can also eat lettuce but you shouldnt give them too much of that, maybe once a week or so.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Fish are fine. You can get a better price at a bait shop than at a pet shop. You could also catch your own. Other potential foods are earthworms, soft-bodied insects, and liver (preferably dusted in bone meal).|`|rao4C9Yxaa	Thats mean =[|`|3IUMh4Igaa	Yes, give them fish. You can get the feeder guppies at most pet shops. Also, you can give them crickets and meal worms. Just put them in the water live... Unless you don't want to be mean...lol|`|vJ0NhNXcaa	Yes. You can feed them "baby reds." If you go to your local pet store ask for a dozen of baby reds for your snappers. Ask the assistant to pick out smaller baby reds versus the larger ones.
Wx8yX4AOaa	First put a cloth over your hand and let your parrot sit on the cloth soon it will get used to the cloth in a couple of days then start using your hand if it wont go to that put your hand on a bed or couch and let it crawl on the bed then pick it up.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Do you put him on your finger, or does he go voluntarily? How long have you had him? <br>  Does he know the step-up trick yet? <br>  I've taught mine to step back onto my finger when it is behind her. It keeps the temptation of biting out of her mind, no biting. Both my Grey an my Macaw step back onto my finger.|`|BjItitz5aa	Congrats! Your African grey parrot rank highest in terms of intelligence, in the sense that you can actually teach him how to talk or mimic human speech.<br>  <br>  If you want hm to be hand-tamed, I suggest that you ask someone else to have some of the wings clipped pr trimmed.  You say he'll get ugly? Yes, but that's only temporary. He'll grow news sets of feathers over time. But your concern is for him to be "dependent" on you. Even if you let him roam around the sala, he can't fly away, but just "walk" like a baby. If he needs food, and he is hungry, then he has no choice but to come up to you. Then, he becomes closer to you and you bond eventually.<br>  <br>  Why, you may ask, do I suggest, somebody else to trim the feathers, like your vet? It is because his struggles during the cutting process will be in his memory,  and YOU, of course, would not like to be in his memory bank. Remember, this is a brainy pet. Sometimes, when learns to talk, he will ask you if you had your lunch already, if you are ok, etc. You will be amazed. And he can stay with you for 10 to 15, up to 20, depending on age and health and care he gets.<br>  <br>  In the Phils., we have mynahs (black with tinge of yellow under the wings)  and sulphur crested parrots (yellow mane and white body), and they are very bright, too. Teach them one or two syllables of speech under darkness, in a quiet room, and he will learn quickly. Don't forget the food reward and the association in the process.|`|Nt1SgPtTaa	You have to allow your parrot response time.  He will<br>  approach your finger when he knows its safe and comfortable.  Try this from inside the cage...it may take<br>  several attempts.  Try and put your finger slowly towards<br>  where he's perched.
vMByDy1raa	If you have no experience a breeder pair is like a couple and like each other and have little time for others.  You haven't said how old and how long they were breeders.  I would walk away unless you do a lot of research because breding pair usually don't socialize well.  Is he splitting up the pair?  If he is they could be sad and if he doesn't they only have eyes for each other.  <br>  I would wait and get a hand fed baby so it would only bond with you.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	If you have no experience with parrots, I would strongly recommend that you walk away from this deal. You would be getting a bird that is set in its ways, which may work out to be a nice pet, but may not. Also remember, that they can live a very long time 40+ years. One has to wonder why he would trade a $900 bird for a kitten. if you want a bird, i would recommend a cockatiel.|`|tATsT9Byaa	I, personally, don't have a lot of experience with these birds....but my aunt took one as a down payment for her house a LONG time ago (she is single with no kids) and has had it for years!  It is the coolest bird I have ever seen and it was a little mean at first but grew to be nice...but mainly to her because she was his "mama".  He was also a baby when she got him so I'm sure that helped!  He is the funniest bird ever, when he started talking it was amazing the things he picked up.  He is like her child and a very loving bird. I know this probably isn't a lot of help but hopefully will influence your decision a little.
N70orPJ6aa	I belive you just pop off the plastic, there isn't any screws. (sorry if I am mistaken, I haven't used these in a long time) The round plastic knob is the florescent light starter and needs to stay in the light fixture. The only thing you need to worry about is getting the plastic off the light. <br>  <br>  Oh and by the way... ESU slimlines are horrible lights (not the fixture, the fixtures are fine). They are just very low quality tube lights. I would get rid of the ESU 7% and replace it with a repti-sun tube light instead. Much better lighting and will be much better for your critters. <br>  <br>  What type of pet are you using this light on?
SZOMVGBRaa	That's like saying how do you sex an animal....<br>  <br>  What kind of fish ???? They are all different, some are easy and some you can't until you see them breed.\<br>  <br>  HAHA, that hole thing is funny but so not true, Males and Females have two holes and you can't see them that well on most fish.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	it depends on the fish all fish are different and there are different way to tell them apart<br>  <br>  <br>  17 years fish hobbiest|`|dE5fs9yzaa	With some its the lenght of the fins and structure. Some could be coloring and some are almost impossible to sex. ask again when you know WHICH fish you need to sex.|`|kqCcrEYvaa	Illegally, generally.|`|4tOeSdXjaa	check below the tail girls have two holes one for poop one for eggs
AA11901352	There are many types of skimmers.  the best ones are the ones with a high water column.  I found the hang on back work better since the water column is higher allowing more bubbles to come incontact with the water using less energy to remove the proteins since it doesn't have to be turned on high.  the skimmer can run off the pump from your filter.  Unless you are going solar, really that is about it.  The newer skimmers are more quiet and use less electric than older ones.  Sorry I couldn't be more help.|`|vVAwFgcJaa	Hello, <br>  I would say in-sump. Like it's been said, a protein skimmer need to be tall for good results. unfortunately, I have not found any hang-on or on-tank skimmer to do a good job. <br>  If your tank is less than 30 gallon, you could do without a skimmer. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
tTntRZNDaa	The first step towards controlling excessive barking is to understand the specific reasons behind it. Training your dog to bark less (you will never stop it altogether) is a time-consuming process. Also keep in mind that some breeds are more apt to bark than others and these could prove more difficult to train.<br>  <br>  Check this link for more info.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/barking-aspca.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/barking-aspca.html</a>|`|VMY7No0eaa	Beagles are notorious for howling...<br>  cover the create with a blanket so it's dark..<br>  hope this helps.|`|zL1sggpCaa	Does he sleep with you or in a crate? If he is in a crate, is that in your room or some where else in the house? <br>  <br>  Is it possible he can hear other dogs from outside? Or does he need to go potty? How old is he?|`|AA11286670	it is a very cruel and controversial thing but many people suggest a shock collar<br>  my brother put one on his dog once, and she yelped for an hour the first time it shocked her, and then of course the yelping made the shocking worse<br>  but i can guarantee you that dog never barked unless it was important again<br>  <br>  another thing that i have tried and found effective that is less cruel, take a bunch of loose change and put it in a an empty soda can and tape up the opening<br>  and whenever the dog barks shake it, it will scare the dog into thinking "if i dont bark i won't hear it"<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|HgMFrllLaa	If the dog "annoys the crap out of you", it's time to rehome him. You do not want a dog and perhaps this one can make someone else happy.<br>  Don't make the same mistake again, get a Nintendo or get laid instead.|`|jPBO4ABPaa	Thats what Beagles do, it appears the Beagle side is more dominate.  Maybe not the breed for you. Beagles howl and bark quite a bit!!!!|`|YCmpgOVtaa	Lol, that's why you should research the breed you're getting...beagles do that..ALOT, my dad had one and he was so annoying. You just have to train him when he starts barking clap your hands at him or make a loud noice to get his attention and tell him to be quiet..eventualy he'll get the jist of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck with that I don't think violence is really going to help thou.<br>  Good to hear you're not going to "Re Home" it, too many people do that when they're dogs become a nuisance..too sad.|`|mzgx7OgFaa	HEY tony you dumbass idiot... its called sarcasm and cynicism.  some people are like that in this world you moron.  next time shut the fk up OR offer help on how to deal with the dog... ill get help on my attitude from my therapist if needed you fkin piece of crap.<br>  <br>  to answer other questions:  he is in a crate, in our laundry room away from us.  we tried to keep him in our room but he was too loud.  i understand that beagles are this way. I used to have my own (VERY KEY POINT) but this one is just out of control.   im thinking about going with the shock collar. he is a cute dog but at night, he is very annoying.  giving him away wont help resolve this matter for you idiots saying i should re-home it. maybe you might give up in life, but i dont. idiots.  thanks to those of you who are actually helping though.|`|wdWxz1vjaa	Well, let me tell you; definitely not the best pup, if you want a quiet one. Beagles and Dachshunds are supposed to bark, if they hear something wrong. However, I cannot tell you what to do to stop them, since it's their nature.
o93EwErKaa	Contrary to what you read, not all puppies have worms, but many do.  There are appropriate wormers for even very tiny puppies that can be used as early as 2 weeks so the poster saying the puppy might not be old enough is untrue though.<br>  <br>  While I think it is a red flag, I send many puppies off with no worming treatment because there is no reason to worm a puppy that doesn't have them, but I do send a negative fecal test instead.  If it is a home situation with just one indoor dog and the mother is properly wormed, than it could be the puppy doesn't have worms.  On the other hand, if the dog is around a large number of dogs than chances are it does have at least roundworms and possibly coccidia which is much harder to treat.<br>  <br>  I would go look at the puppy and the environment.  If everything is clean and the puppy and mom look well cared for I would feel ok with it.  I would get a contract in writing that said she would reimburse for the fecal analysis and medications if the dog had a parasite though, including coccidia and giardia.  Take a look at the puppy's stools, if they are formed and he doesn't look potbellied then there is a good chance his fecal analysis will come back clear.  I would also want the contract to include return of puppy and money within 48 hours if the vet finds anything really wrong.  In any event, I would take the dog and a fecal sample into a vet and get him started on his vaccines (if he is at least 8 weeks old).|`|3giaPYe8aa	Stay clear!|`|I38WF5aFaa	Don't worry about it.  Its easy to worm a puppy.  Some things to look for:  Are you supporting an unethical breeder?  Is there a reason the puppies are not wormed?  Chances are this is an uninformed breeder or an accidental litter.  Find out all you can about the parents and why they were bred,  then decide if you want to buy the puppy.  Insist on a 3 day money back guarantee and get a vet check.  If the vet finds anything wrong with the puppy insist on your money back.  Worms are not a big deal,  but they do need to be dealt with.|`|7uznrLBXaa	I'd stay away.  The lack of worming is probably not the only issue!  I've purchased from breeders (and adopted from rescues - another good idea), and I took a looong time before finding a breeder.  I solicited referrals from friends and vets, visited every breeder, made "surprise" visits, etc.  If you buy from breeders, you really have to take your time and do your homework - there are far too many bad breeders out there!   I certainly would not go just by a newspaper ad and vet check. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|cETQuE9waa	First of all I wouldn't get a puppy unless it was 10 weeks old, vaccinated, and wormed. <br>  <br>  If the person hasn't done any of these things then I would not buy from them.|`|FdcWPp48aa	How old is the puppy?  Why hasn't it been wormed?  Doesn't sound like an ethical breeder if you ask me.|`|6r4hmaN3aa	It depends on the puppies age. Some puppies can't get wormed til the are older. Also look into the breeder. If the breeder seems responsble then yes it is ok. Also when I went with my grandma to buy her puppies the breeder hadn't wormed them and asked my grandmother if she wanted them wormed or if she wanted her own vet to worm them on their first check-up. The worming is very simple to do. When the one puppy y grandmother had got worms even though it was wormed i had to reworm it and i am 13. i suggest that if you buy the puppy that you tell the breeder that if their is something wrong with it you will bring it back. bye the way to worm a puppy the vet will bring something out that looks like yograt in an needle with out the actual needle and will put it in the puppies mouth. then will push it out. and it taste like beef so the puppy will eat it. My dog wanted mre and tired to get it when  i did it to his brother. depending on the size of the dog it might need to be wormed twice.|`|4ccRz453aa	A lot of the time it isn't safe to worm for various reasons (eg. size, age, weight). I wormed my own puppy, and your vet will do it on the first visit. Or they should. I think it's fine....|`|C5YBD3F1aa	If this "breeder" is so irresponsible and uncaring to not even worm her puppies, then you will be supporting a horrible business. Stay clear.|`|HgMFrllLaa	This is a "red flag". Stay away.|`|2eJcaeOPaa	the vet will worm it for you :)
AA11901352	Well that would depend.  What exactly do these dots look like?  Small air bubbles?<br>  <br>  Ich is a parasite however it doesn't attach decorations or the tank itself.<br>  <br>  Culmnaris is a bacterial problem and it too does not attach to the decorations or the tank.<br>  <br>  IIf it were just on the fish, I would say it may be ich, however if they are the same types of spots all over the tank decorations and the fish I had been told years ago it could be a bacteria.  I cannot remember the name but this bacteria actually will eat the left over foods in the tank.  Sounds weird I know but it can happen.  An anti bacterial can be used   If your fish are acting fine eating swimming and you are sure it isn't ich (use an antiparasidic) more than likely it is a bacterial problem.<br>  <br>  Are you sticking to a weekly 25% water change?  You need to stick to some sort of schedule and cleaning.  This will help|`|SOxdyWQOaa	it's a fungus clean the tank real good|`|D178335Paa	it's a fungus. Like ick. Do what she/he said ^^^|`|ahKUbSc1aa	im afraid your description is a bit vague but if its on the decor as well i would say you may have a parasitic problem and need to get the correct remedy and water conditions for the aquarium. if you can take a piece of decor (in tank water) and a water sample to a reputable retailer and have them take a look at it. other than that you may have a fungal infection but its rare to see that on decor as well as your fish. white spot is only found on a fish normally so i really would get it checked out as soon as possible<br>  hope this helps|`|lFdWmDjGaa	It could be some type of fungus, try cleaning it off everything and change the fishes water.
MUfMJYHGaa	She needs to work well in the halter. She should be walking and trotting alongside you  (at the shoulder) in a willing, alert (not whacked out) manner. She should not have to be dragged into the trot or through her turns or to the halt.Don't be afraid to use a driving whip as an aid when you teach her to move out or away from you. You want her to stand square and quietly at the halt and you need to teach her to position her feet with a cue (voice or your  foot movement combined with halter pressure) if she tends to halt with her feet "out of the box". Work a lot on voice commands as you can use these in the ring without penalty. Work one phase at a time ,until she gets it right, then add another component. When it's good at the walk, start at the trot. When she's really good, take her into a small arena and see if she'll work off line.Go to some local shows and see what the judges ask for and teach her the most common routines. And teach her to stand and be patient with someone walking around her and other horses moving around her. That's where a lot of them blow it. Remember halter classes are judged a lot on conformation so don't be disappointed if she's perfect in line and you don't score high. She's being penalized for something you can't fix.|`|oUdo4kBYaa	you dont have to.   she can go along your shoulder.
Mg8zk1n7aa	Haflingers are awesome horses. They probably wouldn't be the best breed for high level barrel racing, but if you just want to have some fun with barrels then sure.|`|XL62syrCaa	They are considered the most VERSATILE horse breed.

I don't know what level of a barrel racer you are, but if you arn't high level (since when fractions of a second count than things like conformation/leg length/stride length and that start to really count) than a haflinger should work just fine.|`|ivX7KIHvaa	well, i have never dealt with a pure halfligner, but we have a halflinger cross at my barn and he is the laziest thing i have ever seen in my life!!!

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Goldfish must ALWAYS have filters. All fish need these, they help maintain the water chemistry by harbouring good bacteria in the filter media as well as providing essential water flow to help oxygenate the tank.    Without a filter the water will turn toxic very quickly with messy fish like Goldfish.    If the tank is new, a pet store SHOULDN'T sell you tank and fish at the same time as the tank needs to go through the nitrogen cycle first which takes 2-6 weeks or so.  http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/The_Nitro...|`|tShDXmgbaa	If you are talking about the aeration pump....you dont need one as long as the water level in your tank is below the filters outpour opening. Its the surface movement of the water that put oxygen in the tank, not the bubbles themself. As the bubbles pop, oxygen is released into the tank.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	If you actually want them to live, get a good power filter. Also check the size tank you are buying. Those little 'beginner' tanks are not a good home for any goldfish, they will either outgrow it or die trying.    Goldfish are a rather messy fish, and grow HUGE, so need very good filtering.    Ian|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	You may have seen tanks without pumps, but chances are they were small fish. Theres an article in one of the aquarium magazines this month about pumpless tanks.    BUT, a goldfish produces so much waste its not even funny. They need filters. They actually need double filtration. The "normal" goldfish (commons and comets) grow to 16 inches. The need a minimum of 55 gallons for a single fish. They also need around 100 gallons of filtration. Fantail goldfish grow to 6-10 inches and need at least 20 gallons for a single fish.    So in short... Goldfish are large and messy. They need very large tanks with alot of filtration. Goldfish are not a beginners fish in any way. They grow far too large for that.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	If you are buying the tank tomorrow, put off buying fish for at least a week. You need to allow the tank time to accumulate beneficial bacteria that will break down fish waste. Adding fish too soon will cause a dangerous spike in ammonia.     What size tank do you plan on buying?   Goldfish are massive waste producers and grow very large. Because of this they require very large aquariums with double the filtration.    An air pump would certainly be beneficial to the fish.|`|AA11708471	normal goldfish need 50+ gallon aquariums with filters    all filters are powered by some sort of pump so yeah you need a pump|`|FhVobWpeaa	they must have some form of filtration and water circulation   there are different  ways to accomplish this.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	The pump provides them with air and circulation.It's worth the extra cost IMO.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	there is a formula that compares surface space of the water with inches of fish, and if you are under that ratio your fish would get enough oxygen, but it just makes sense to have a pump to circulate the water. you don't want a stagnate tank in a week or two do you? plus it is a good idea to change 20% of the water once a week when you have a filter, without one its more like 90% and i'm pretty sure you don't want to do that. and, moving water is just more relaxing. go for the pump, you and your fish will be glad you did.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	good filtration will keep them happy
SHNFW8nzaa	depends what sort of newt it is.   i would clean out bout once a month and feed it every 3 to 4 days. remember never to use tap water only spring water(bottlled water). dust the crikets with reptivite mineral powder which you can get on the internet. i would also recomend seeing if it eats eearthworms chopped up. however the most important thing is the clean tank. if the tank is always clean it can live well with the right food.

He may just need the moisture on his skin.|`|c7lVixQTaa	It could be many things but these are what i've encountered:    it could have parasites and is sitting in the water to relieve itself. or, it could be about to shed and needs the moisture and humidity to help ease the process. however, i suggest you post the question on a reptile board so you can get expert opinions for your pet.|`|SiPZHrn4aa	Spotted salamanders are fully terrestrial (except when breeding), but your house is much too warm for him to be ready and waiting to breed.  He is probably stressed by the toxins the green tree frogs give off mixing with his own.  Put him in his own tank.|`|87sj8YBGaa	Maybe he is, but maybe he is uncomfortable sharing space in the tank.  But that is an unlikely answer.  He might be trying to lower his body heat by getting wet and using the water to aid in the heat transfer from his body.|`|0kINjVvnaa	Some animals just like to lay in some water and enjoy. To the best of my knowledge salamanders are amphibious so that probably explains why it's spending most of its time in the water.|`|lIRCcWpSaa	Having a bath?
43bb1de059cf4886a340467b97276fecaa	Reptiles don't smell unless they either have health problems or are dead.    Corn snakes can musk if they feel they are threatened or are being handled roughly. They will emit a watery mess that smells, and it comes from their cloaca (where poo also comes from).    Provide your daughter's corn snake with a water dish. It will use it as needed to drink or bathe. Just keep fresh water in its aquarium daily. And handle it with care.      Good luck!~|`|f0297cb57aed06b186ca12e00181c7aeaa	Get rid of it.|`|b90e42d25bd45025e46d388ab0c06d12aa	Give it a bath (not with soap), but just soak him in warm water for a while.|`|3IUMh4Igaa	That is very odd. I have many corn snakes and the only time there is any oder is when they poo. I use Eco Earth bedding and spot clean it when needed and then I change out all the bedding every third month. There is no smell.
TPirHBDjaa	LOL to the person who wrote "chis come in one size." LMAO.  Does she know anything?  Chihuahuas come in different sizes. I've seen tiny teacup chihuahuas and I've seen toy poodle size chihuahuas.  Whatever.    Anyway,  list your dog on www.kijiji.com  under NY and you will find a buyer.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Don't give her to a pet shop.  They don't give a flying flip about your dog, and will sell her to anyone.  They sell to satanists that sacrifice animals to satan, perverts that have sex with dogs, etc.  They don't do ANY screening.    Look at these sites.  Don't support pet shops.    http://stoppuppymills.org/ http://saynotopetstorepuppies.com/ http://millbusters.com/    Give her to a shelter or Chihuahua Rescue.  They screen all potential owners.|`|AA12128656	sell her to someone you don't know?     perish the thought!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|q5TchS9jaa	Hot dog stand|`|PM23RDycaa	Advice one - stop call her a teacup. Chis come in one size    Advice two - contact the ny coordinator of the Chihuahua rescue. They will find her a good home    http://www.chihuahua-rescue.com/contact....    Do NOT sell your dog to a pet shop. Pet shops do not take proper care of any of their animals.|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	You dont have a teacup dog. You have a Chihuahua. I would put up flyers in your vet's office.
AA11457471	I can't believe people have to tell you to TAKE YOUR DOG TO THE VET!!!  Could be something stuck in his throat or the roof of his mouth (yes, even though he ate a treat!) so don't give him anything else to eat. Could be a mini seizure, stroke, poisoning.....the list goes on & on...|`|gwUMipsUaa	He could have had a stroke.  It does happen sometimes in young dogs.  Take him to the vet NOW.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Could be epilepsy as well but ONLY A VET CAN SAY FOR SURE!!!!!  Take him ASAP.|`|AA12128656	sounds like a seizure. get to a vet pronto|`|TnPiiwoAaa	Without being funny, it sounds like he might have eaten a frog. My dogs get all foamy and act weird when they've been attacking frogs. To get rid of the foaming take some instant coffee (It really work, trust me!) and put it on your finger, and stick it in his mouth. Foam all gone. But if you think he's had a stroke or is in pain at all then take him to a vet. My advice is for frog eaters. :)|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	A stroke is not unusual nor is a seizure. It could have been either one.  Sometimes when a dog is chattering or shaking it is because of pain. How are his teeth? If he has one that is giving him pain, that could be it also.|`|673bc6b8fb57e4a11e9a3252086823f2aa	TAKE HIM TO THE VET IMMEDIATELY!!!!    He could have had some sort of allergy problems, stroke or poisoning.|`|soKNqDd3aa	Put on some clothes when you're around your dog.|`|DXz6gIeuaa	You need to take him to a vet asap. This can lead to lethargy extremely quickly. He may have eaten something and may be poisoned. I've have this problem with my dog and the only reason we didn't take him to the vet was because we saw him get ahold of the poison frog and washed his mouth out before he ingested any of it. Your dog may have already ingested some poison (if he did in fact get poison) and that would mean you need to consult a vet asap. If you want more information call your vet and tell him/her your dogs symptoms. Please don't take this lightly..|`|4vFhrSpGaa	he could have had a stroke or a seizer!tak him to the vet ASAP!if you don't he can get extremely sick so be ready!|`|iDMSLAmtaa	dont waste time on yahoo answers!!!! take him to the vet immediatly!!! it cood be a stroke. you dont want your dog to die do you?|`|jem0fyhiaa	TAKE HIM TO THE VET NOW!!!!
AGbusTqGaa	You can try squirting lemon juice in his mouth everytime he does it.  Make sure that its pure lemon juice though, don't water it down bc it makes it taste better and the goal is for it to be gross so they will understand that when they bite they get a gross taste in their mouth.  It works really well for my dog, she's even scared of the bottle now.|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	my puppy had the same problem, so this is THE ONLY thing that works for him..    everytime he bites you, spray him with a water bottle. a plastic spray one you can buy from the dollar store. anytime he puts his teeth on anything that isnt his, spray him..eventually he will get the hint and all u have to do is shake the spray bottle and he'll stop!|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	When he bites, you make a loud yelping sound and then totally ignore him. Pay Absolutely NO attention to him. Eventually he will realize that you are not going to pay any attention to him if he bites. Good luck!    Added: Please never ever hit or tap your dog as one person suggested.    Maybe try putting some pennies in a can and shake it at the pup when they try to bite. Never spray or hit them.|`|q5TchS9jaa	Get rid of the dog or use a muzzle.|`|CPZA5qrGaa	Bite 'em back.  It works for me.  Feed 'em,give 'em a rawhide chew toy.   Perhaps your dog is cutting new teeth  or has one or a couple loose ones he/she   is trying to remove.|`|XotR4X9kaa	get a muzzle thingy if u cant find any other soloution > dont leave it on like 24/7 cause thats just meaner than the dog biting you..|`|9167fa19ace7dcedf3455af90acdd59eaa	muzzle it!|`|673bc6b8fb57e4a11e9a3252086823f2aa	The biting is her way of being playful but it's a habit that you need to break now.    Give her some chew toys and anytime she goes to bite you, tap her on her nose and tell her NO.. then show her the toy.    You are going to have to be patient cause it takes a while.|`|WLNX00c3aa	how old is your dog? is he still a pup? if so, it's called teething..he'll continue to do that till he loses all his baby teeth.  but you want to stop the biting now. that teaches alot of bad habits.     to do that, try using a bit of hot sauce on your hands...when he bites down he will taste the hot sauce and back away.|`|WAHsITZhaa	There's a difference between biting aggressively or playfully ( like if it's a puppy) not sure which one is the case?    Just make sure in both cases that you're the dominant one, lay him down in his back on the ground and be above him holding him down.. he will calm down and understand eventually that you're the boss. treat him when he lies down by himself submissively..|`|zQdYBoSpaa	It depends how old your dog is. If its still a puppy under 2 yrs old then when it bites u grab its mouth close it shut say no biting in a firm voice in ur dogs ear. If your dog is not still a puppy you should muzzle it or keep try the close mouth thing.|`|XRxLZYFwaa	When you play with him and he bites, take your hand away and say "ouch" in a high pitched voice, kind of like a doggy yelp. Wait a few seconds before you start playing again. Do this two times. The third time he bites, you get up and walk away. He will soon realise that biting means the playing stops. Come back after a while and play with him again, repeating the process.
px27V5N9aa	If you purchase the vaccines from Jeffers then you give them yourself.    Depending on which state you are in, you can also give Rabies.  (Before all of you give a thumbs down on that you need to do your homework, some states allow Livestock owners to give rabies)  A Vet has to do the Coggins though.    As for your shows...you will have to look at their rules for each show and see what they require.  Some may say just Coggins.  Others may require your horse have other vaccinations (rhino,flu,strangles, potomac, west nile, etc..), documented by a vet.  If so, then call your vet and tell them you gave the vaccine and will they list it on the Health Cert or do they need to give the shots.  Some vets will just list the vaccines you gave.  Most will not.  Save the lot   and packaging from the vaccines you give to present to your vet.    ADD:  If you are allowed to give your own rabies...it will NOT be accepted at the show ring if they require it.  Normally they want the vet to have administered all vaccines.  Again, the only way to know is to contact their people.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Have your vet give the vaccines.  I am an RN, and I have my vet give the vaccines to my horses.  The vet can take into account the full body of accumulated knowledge, research,  experience of what is going on in the area, and knowledge of my horse's status to determine what vaccines and route of administration are best at that time.  There is way more to vaccinating than learning how to stick a needle in an animal.  Pay the extra cost to do it right, and be glad the show associations are smart enough to require such evidence.  It protects your horse as well as everyone else's.    ADD....a vet that signs for a drug that he/she did not draw up and administer him/herself is violating the law and can and will, if caught, lose the license to practice medicine as the result.  The same laws apply to RNs.....we never sign for a medication that we didn't draw up and administer ourselves.  The only time we even legally co-sign on a drug is when we are working with a qualified student and we have witnessed and maintained physical or visual custody of the drug during the process that begins with identifying the vial label, then the process of drawing it up, and continuing until we witness the administration. And, the custody of that drug begins when we pick it up from the hospital pharmacy and they sign, and we sign for custody. Maybe you can see why I feel as I do about regulating these vaccinations when my horses may come into contact with yours, and who knows who may or may not have administered the vaccines.  Unless a professional who stands to lose his or her very hard earned license and career has sworn by virtue of his/her signature that this particular vaccine was indeed administered to the horse in question, what good does any documentation do, and what does it even mean?    We are sometimes dealing with epidemic level communicable diseases on this.  Why would anyone be against regulating this to protect all of our horses?    If you are going to keep your horses on your own property, and not expose them to any horses outside of that population, they are virtually living in an environment of isolation, and in that case giving your own vaccines is your choice and your consequence.  But when they leave that isolated environment, whatever they may be infected with leaves with them.  And if it is communicable, it spreads.......  epidemiology 101.|`|EghHVkHEaa	If you are going to show your horse the vaccines will need to be administered by a vet.|`|5kUxkun3aa	The vet is the only person to sign your passport. They  are like a legal document. If a vet was to put a different date or something they can get struck off|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	I do my own shots ( I keep my epi close by). But if you don't know how, get the vet. A vet will usually not administer vaccines from somewhere's else.  If you show you absolutely need a coggins (EIA) and possibly health papers.  Check with the show people for what you need.  You have to get Coggins and health papers from the vet.|`|AA11353999	We do our own routine vaccinations (equine flu, WNV, etc.) & wormings. However, depending on the state you live in, your vet will have to give Rabies & do the Coggins testing. For Coggins, the blood will have to go to a lab, your vet will do the paperwork, and in a week you'll get the results back.    If you're transporting across state lines, your horse will need a Health Certificate. If you're transporting to another country, your horse will need a Passport. A certified veterinarian is the only person who can do either of those.    The best thing is to call the Club or Show Management and ask what your horse will need for registration in the show.    Good luck!|`|ndqjst7taa	I have my vet come out give them there vaccines and anything else they will need they also give them a good going over to make sure theirs nothing wrong. I also have the coggins test done for the shows.|`|xKHeYmQJaa	I vaccinate my own horses, using Innovator 4.  I get mine from Southern States.  The vaccine needs to stay cold until you give it.  Inside the package is a label that you can pull off and stick on your health record.  On the label is the name of the vaccine and the lot  .  If you don't have a health record, go to www.intervet.com to get your form.  This web site also diagrams where the injection sites are.    If your vet gives your vaccines, he will give you a receipt or another piece of documentation that states that he administered vaccines and what type.    If you do the vaccinations, but are uncertain if that is acceptable, ask your vet if he would sign off on your health record.   -- It's always a good thing to have your vet see your horses once a year, not just for general health visits, but to maintain a relationship.  That way, he knows you and your horses.
3p6wp7DYaa	I would call the vet immediately and ask for advice. It may be that 4 pills is not really a dangerous overdose, but the only one who could know for sure is the vet. If you see vomiting, lethargy, and any other symptoms, put the dog in the car and drive to the vet as fast as you can.    Good luck!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Take him to the vet.|`|5765d15bf5b7da6026f760e75cea316faa	Call your vet ASAP.|`|xTAR26Gkaa	Call your vet. How long ago did your dog eat them?

I forgot when I gave my dogs their last Interceptor and when I picked some up at my vets I said, now if I double dose them by mistake is that bad, they said no it will not harm them, they would have to eat about 30 for it to do any harm.    It won't hurt your dog but a call to your vets to make sure that Sentinel isn't bad might be in order, I can only honestly answer you for Interceptor.|`|WnpaPlz2aa	i would definitely take my dog to the vet. other than that maybe read the box that they come in and see if it has a warning on it. im not really too sure what to do about this. umm i honestly don't think that it would hurt the puppy but still wont hurt to get the pup to the vet or just call and ask to see what they say.
Z0v6G0Kgaa	Contrary to claims, all dogs shed.  It's just that some shed like crazy (double-coated dogs, labs, Aussies--dogs like that).  And all dogs put off dander (dead skin).  A small dog with a short coat that is fed a high quality food (no wheat, no corn) will also shed less because it's less likely to have allergies and less likely to itch (producing dander).    I have a suggestion for you in terms of a dog.  It's not small in size but it's very small in terms of behavior.  Get yourself a greyhound rescue.    A 2-3 year old greyhound rescue will....  --come crate trained (so that makes house training a lot easier)  --it's a very docile breed.  It may not be used to other dog breeds but by nature, greys are very docile and are more likely to freeze when confronted with something unexpected.  --doesn't bark.  That's a biggie.  If you go off to classes and leave your dog at home, it may bark at the postman, at trucks going by, at random sounds, to tell you it's bored.  Most toy and small dogs are yappy or even alarm barkers.  Not a greyhound.  --not a problem for it to be in a crate.  In fact, an adult rescue will need a 30 minute walk each day and spend the rest of the time napping in a sunny spot or lounging near your feet.  --exceptionally calm and mellow dog.  Partially it's the breed.  Partially it's the age (at 2-3, greyhounds really mellow out even more).  Partially it's the training (they spend big chunks of time in their crates at the track and barking gets them nothing so they learn it's a waste of time to bark in your crate.    Downsides to a greyhound.  --you can't ever let it off leash outside or it could be gone forever.  --it will need a coat if you live outside of the south.  --it will never cuddle on your lap (well, unless you've got a football scholarship to Univ. of Alabama to play defensive tackle).    If you really insist upon a small dog and can't do a greyhound, here are some other tips:  1.  Don't get a puppy.  It's like having a baby.  At weeks 9-10-11 you should expect to get up in the middle of the night every 2-3 hours.  It can't stay in the crate more than 3 hours.  You'll have house-training issues for at least the first 6 months and maybe the first year.  Nuff said.    2.  Beware most toy and small dogs.  I've got a 17 pound rat terrier who I love.  But he's an alarm barker.  And if you've got to crate your dog 1-2 times a day when you head off to class, a dog that barks incessantly will drive your parents wild!     3.  Specific breeds:  everyone loves their breed and you'll get a gazillion posts on here, everyone advocating a different breed.  Well, there are good and bad examples of every breed.  The larger issues are fit to your lifestyle.  Are you athletic (ie: you could use a jogging partner)?  Do you live in a cold weather area?  Do you want a dog to take out to the park or meadow and play frisbee with?  How long will you need to crate your dog on a typical day?    Last of all, think about looking at an adult rescue.  They're typically more mellow (because they're older).  They'll often be crate trained and house-trained.  A smaller, older rescue could be ideal for your situation.  Just look for a breed specific rescue organization and then be patient.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Sorry but all dogs shed, unless you want a mexican hairless, or a chinese crested.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Bichon Frise?    No dog doesn't shed, though... the ones bred to be hypoallergenic either shed very little or have a reduced amount of dandruff in their hair.    If you're planning on spaying or neutering your new puppy, why not try adopting? Shelter dogs are generally up to date with shots and have already been spayed/neutered (but some shelters jump the gun and fix before six months, which is too young, so be careful).|`|FPaJ1AU0aa	I have a maltese x poodle (shelter dog) and he doesnt really shed that much, I admit, theres no such thing as a non shedding, fluffy dog, but my guy is about as good as it gets!    Check out your local shelter for your new pet! :)|`|iLrp65oXaa	As a dog owner in my late 20's looking back I wouldn't have had time for a dog in college.  You are too busy with school work and your life, as you should be.  Dogs are take a ton of work and time with training.  This is especially true if you are interested in getting a puppy.    Any breed can be aggressive, it is something you would have to deal with if it came up.  Early socialization and training can prevent this.    All dogs shed, even the ones marketed as being hypoallergenic.  Dogs with "hair" like shih tzus, yorkies, maltese, bichons, will shed less than double coated dogs.  Poodles also shed less than many breeds.  All things with hair shed, including you.      Any dog can be hyper.  Most puppies are hyper, it is what being a puppy is all about.  The more exercise the dog gets the less hyper it will be.  Terriers are usually very high strung dogs with high exercise requirements for their size.|`|V1pOG3Cgaa	Some kind of a small poodle mix. Curly hair. Don't get a terrier though. Most tend to be very hyper. You will need the dog to be small if you want to study. Your parents will probably need to take care of the dog after you move on so plan on what they would like. Puppies are like newborn babies so if you don't want the hassle of a puppy which is very time consuming then adopt a pet.|`|U4R0XLa0aa	I have a breed mixture of maltese and poodle. They don't grow too much and they're pretty friendly. They need a little bit of attention on their hair, but if you brush their hair 3 times a week, that will be good maintenance. I don't recommend you to get a chihuahua because they're very noisy. Also, you may want to have a teacup yorkie.|`|4vFhrSpGaa	only a few dogs shed but some just get matted.a cavalier king charles spaniel only sheds a little as a puppy!same with yorkies,nova scotia duck tolling retrievers and shiba inus'. here is my cavalier if it gives you an idea but she is full grown but her fur isn't.   http://www.doggysnaps.com/mykennel/

NnYB9eXiaa	Hamsters can pick up on human feelings.  If you're calmer, he'll be calmer.  They also have distinct personalities.  Just like you may be calm and your brother could be hyper, that type of thing.  Never ever squeeze your hamster - part of the reason he may be so squirmy and spastic is because he *knows* that if he's picked up, he's gonna get squished!  That would make me nervous too if I was him :)    You can't FORCE an animal to sit still, especially a robo - they're the smallest and fastest of any of the known hamster species.  They require daily, attention or they quickly forget that they *can* be picked up and held, so you need to stick with the program!    They'll also be less squirmy if they've been running in their wheel for a while as well, or let him crawl into a hamster ball and burn off some spare energy, and lastly, just like a human -- they may not be in the mood to play some days!    1. Wash your hands carefully with a non-fruity or heavily scented soap - this will keep them from wanting to taste, and possibly bite your hand.  Others may advise you to wear gloves - this prevents the hamster from learning your scent, and you want them to know YOU when you're handling them, not the smells on a glove.    2. NEVER reach into the hamster cage and try to *grab* your hamster. Hamsters are quite protective of their homes and will try to defend them (aka bite you or flip over and scream -- which is a defense mechanism). Females tend to be more "cage aggressive" than males, although with time and patience, this will diminish with either one.    3. Hold a small cup or bowl in front of the cage door with a yummy treat in it - the hamster will crawl in almost every time.    4. Slide the lil guy out of the cup/bowl into your hand - and voila! You're holding your hamster and haven't been bitten!    Be careful as they will be a bit skittish (and dwarfs are little speed demons so it may try to run up your arm). Of course you'll want to be sure to be extra gentle as they are still animals and can bite when they get scared!  They may also lick/nibble your fingers, don't mistake this for biting, it just means they're curious.  Nibbling tickles - biting hurts ;)    Once your hamster gets more accustomed to you and how you smell, you'll be able to skip step 3 and they'll crawl right into your hand.    Best of luck - and have patience|`|Km6gOd61aa	Well' first off NEVER squeeze a hamster, one of my hamsters had been returned to the pet store when I bought him and if you squeeze him even the slightest bit his eyes like bulge out of his head. He's is scared to death of you!    If you want him to like youquickly grab him out of his cage and hold him. If he squirms don't squeeze just get a playpen sit inside with him and let him explore you.    He needs to know that you're not going to hurt him. Just try it.    E-mail me with any questions at angeladdie270@yahoo.com|`|GaSK15Kpaa	Hi it sounds like hes very nervous - have you taken him to the vets to see what they say. Try holding the treat and the end of your fingers and keeping your hand very still and wait for him to come to you then when he does let him take the treat and slowly withdraw your hand then try again. This is what I did and my hammy adores being handled now. I hope this helps.     Lucinda|`|gTXUcd1maa	Be gentle with him. Just stick your hand in the cage, let him run like a maniac, but soon enough he will calm down and out of curiosity come over to sniff. Let him sniff your hand and then after a while slowly scoop him up. Good luck!|`|mwiv8wxHaa	well stop freaking squeezing it|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	You should have gotten a baby hamster to start with, maybe your hamster doesn't like being handled because of a bad experience before you bought him. My neighbors dog is the same way with children.|`|PUlQXDAyaa	unfortunatly the exact same thing happened to me i brought a hamster then my parents spit so i moved and i sort of neglected her i cleaned and fed her but i didnt really pick her up. when we got settles i tried picking her up and she kept biting me and running so i got her a ball so she got used to going out of the cage and i started picking her up for like 30 seconds then 1 min and so on. it is a matter of letting him get used to you. easing him in xxx hope this helps xxx
iLrp65oXaa	get a life.|`|3giaPYe8aa	After he is neutered.|`|ddPkDxF3aa	Awe ur to late should have started at 6 weeks|`|5JFG5W4uaa	Jorge...it is an animal, they know sex when they go into heat (female) that is, and you can't teach an old dog this trick.  Have the dog neutered unless you want puppies all over the place.  Spartawo...
50WCN0graa	Yes, they know how to swim. Don't spend any money on a training for purposes related to teaching swimming. Goldens are excellent swimmers, but sometimes they are scared at first. We had to go in the water with ours the first few hours and force her to swim until she realized she knew how and fell in love with it. He can swim, he just needs the confidence and patience to realize he knows how.    As far as hip displaysia... make sure he is easy on his joints (especially back joints). Minimize his jumping up and down (we lift our dog on to the bed and in the car). Don't let anyone pull him by his legs while playing. If he can be easier on his joints, some people believe that can help.    Additionally, we give our dog dietary supplements. Glucosamine, calcium, and chondroitin all contribute to joint and hip health.    Finally, if you want you can have his hips x-rayed to see how healthy they are. You would need to wait to do this until he is full grown... around 2 years. This might be able to tell you if you should amp up the dietary supplements or maybe your vet would have other preventative care suggestions.    Finally, the biggest step we are taking.... we are waiting until our retriever is full grown to be neutered. There is some research that suggests neutering a large breed dog before they are full grown can lead to problems in their bone structure (they grow taller when neutered early, but their structure is weaker).     This is sort of "edgy, new" research... some people believe it, some don't. Since, our dog is in our constant supervision, we have chosen to wait to neuter him until he is at least 2 years... we watch him like a hawk so he doesn't impregnate unspayed females, though. The thought behind this is that the sex hormones and growth hormones are related. If you neuter a dog before they finish growing, they will no longer grow in the same way because the sex hormones aren't there to tell the growth plates when to stop at the appropriate time. As a result, some bones will grow longer than they should and others shorter, thus putting pressure on the joints. For females, though, things are more complicated due to other reproductive issues. It is much easier to wait to neuter a male than a female.    Best wishes finding a playmate!|`|ynjrtIdUaa	Dogs usually teach themselves through play in the water as a pup.  Swimming is learned.    Displasia is a degenerative disease and is generally genetic, not preventable.  Pick you dog carefully, and ask about it's lineage.    See link below.|`|6Ow34Lokaa	Goldens? Water? Trying to keep him out of water is a tougher job.  Just don't force him in, that might make him scared. Enjoy him, they are very intelligent and loyal. I would attach a tennis ball to a surf cast fishing rod, cast the ball out very far. Handsome Bastard (his name) would swim out to it, grab it and stop swimming so I could reel him in. His favorite thing. Made it tough to take him fishing for fish.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	It is natural for them to swim, but not all like it.  You can't stop the dog from getting displaysia, it is genetic for the most part.  Give glucosamine supplements and that may help.|`|135587141c574a1880bd4e34dcbdb34caa	Pretty much all dogs know how to swim. I carried my collie mix into the bay, and her legs were moving before she hit the water, and she swam back to shore.    Most retreivers enjoy the water.    You'll have to do some research on where to get a dog, but why not try a Golden rescue group? Although one would think there wouldn't be many goldens given up by people, but you never know.  Just make sure it's a reputable place.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Yes, but the question is will they.  Just because a dog can swim doesn't mean that they will want to swim. Some need to be persuaded to swim.    I know of a Golden  5x Master National & gundog hall of famer that finally got chucked into the pond because he didn't want to learn how to swim.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	This totally depends on how early you expose them to the water and to swimming.  I've had to teach some Golden's to swim because they had never been exposed to a place to swim in!  All Golden have the capiability to swim, but that doesn't mean they will do it automatically!     I've seen some sink like rocks and have to go in after them!  They did learn but to expect them to just swim is very foolish.
C1eHfhrHaa	she could have gone through a heat cycle and you didn't know it.  not all dogs bleed copious amounts of blood.  So, yes, it is very possible.|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	Only if she was in heat and they are both not fixed|`|xEyyFrPhaa	if she was on heat then yes she can get pregnant you should take her to the vets cos she's too young to be pregnant bitches should be at least 2 years old before being bred she's still a baby really.      why don't you want people to tell you to do the right thing by taking her to the vets.|`|6qsocyK3aa	I will tell you to take her to the vet because it's what you should be doing, if not to find if she is pregnant, but to spay her.|`|ozO2fI61aa	Yes, I think she can be pregnant!|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Strange that she hasn't had her heat before 1 year... maybe you missed it?    She could be having a false pregnancy. I know you said no vets, but I would recommend taking her to the vet and having an ultrasound performed.|`|AA11746368	It is possible.  She should be spayed by a year old, and the male shoudl be neutered - or at least do one or the other, if they're going to be together.  I'm going to ignore your request not to say this - TAKE HER TO THE VET!|`|AA11882737	yes she can but id watch  her shes too young what was you thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that could kill her too|`|rCNRcF5waa	I think dog's cycles are hard to notice.  With some dogs its pretty obvious. My grandparents dog bled everywhere till she was fixed. My mom's dog on the other hand has never been fixed. Nor has she ever bled or shown any signs of going into heat.  At 1 year old, she's probably capable of getting pregnant.  And since women become fertile before they have a first period. It's very possible that she became fertile and pregnant before ever showing signs of her heat.|`|actpkfTgaa	Yes My dogs mom was only 9 months when she had her pups  there were 11 alltogethbut one sadly died, but usually the younger  they are when they get pregnant the more chances of them  not making it or puppies not making it, the best thing to do would  be to take her to the vet and explain everything to them  and after see what they think.    Good Luck!|`|4CMx1uzXaa	She could be pregnant. It may also be a phantom pregnancy hence the symptoms. I am not being funny, but if anything were wrong with the pregnancy then (I know you dont wanna hear) take her to vets. If its her first pregnancy and she is so young there may (just slight chance though) be complications. Best to find out early. Good luck|`|wWkfASTNaa	Its not possile for the the dog to have gotten pregnant without a heat cycle, she may have and you just didnt know it. So it is possible, in which case I would talk to a vet, because chi's will most of the time need a c-section to have their puppies.|`|jLM3eTNDaa	Dogs can get pregnant at the 1st heat cycle(this happens around 6 to 10 mths old) since she is about a year then she has already been through 1 cycle..    I raised Chihuahuas for years sometimes you won't catch them in heat unless you pay extremely close attention.    Its entirely possible she is pregnant and ideally you should take her to the vet to have her checked at least once before she gives birth(and to confirm pregnancy) and at least once after the puppies are born.     Chihuahuas can have difficult pregnancies and do you want to take the chance of losing your precious baby if she cannot give birth?|`|B5tVvvR7aa	She shouldn't be able to get pregnant until her first heat, which can vary by dog breed. For some breeds, it can be as early as 6-8 months, other breeds tend to be around her first birthday. Your best bet: have her spayed ASAP . I know someone who worked at a kennel. The benefit to spaying her early is that it will decrease your dogs chance of cancer greatly. Same for your male... even if he is older, he would benefit as well being neutered.     Hope this helps!    but i'd talk to a vet too!|`|zWsbkLBOaa	not unless someone rapes it first. its not mature yet dee dadee|`|13GiEMILaa	i thought the same about my puppy, it might just have worms, i would go online and look up the symptoms, worms make your dog look bloated and hack..hope this helps.|`|ki4GJTi7aa	bitches can only get pregnant while theyre on theyre heat cycle  so if she not been on heat yet then theres no chance of gettin pregnant.    :)
Um8osMNuaa	You should flush them down the toilet.

ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Your dog may be teething so get him a nylon bone to chew on.  It would keep him busy and he will get over the teething pains.|`|9qdyyyINaa	our lab in now 6 months and went through the same stage. "mouthing" is the only way pups know how to interact with other pups, or humans. Be consistent with whichever method you choose. Whether you want to "yelp", or use a firm 'NO", or ignore the puppy altogether when they nip at you.  Our lab seemed to finally get it after her puppy teeth feel out last month. now she barely nips at all. be patient and consistent.|`|kUZvraXVaa	I have a 3 month old lab puppy who also has a problem with nipping and biting. I think he does it to show affection, get attention, when he's mad, when he's happy, and even sometimes when his teeth are sore, but that's more of a chewing action. When he is caught biting I let out a strong "NO.", in a deep low-toned voice, sounds more like a growl in the dog world. If he doesn't stop I flick him in the nose or yelp really loudly, just to get his attention elsewhere. If he stops I give him one of his chew-approved toys and praise him if he chews on the toy. Puppies chew, that's a fact of life, we just have to teach them what they can chew on and what they can't. I take cheap washcloths, get them wet, ball them up, and freeze them. He loves them. Hope this helps!|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I agree with Angela and Doogie11. Yelp loudly, stop all play and turn your back on your puppy. Then initiate play after a few minutes. That's how they learn from their litter mates. This didn't work completely for my puppy and eventually I just started handing him a toy when he was really excited. It totally worked. Instead of biting he would grab a toy. To this day when he gets excited, when I come home etc. he immediately goes and gets a toy. Good luck!
kBaz5eyHaa	Rats are nervous, and sometimes there first reaction is to bite to see if your food, this will hurt especially if they are old and males, Maybe start with putting them on the bed with you close by, make a little place to hide (my boys love it when the pillows make a little cave), and then slowly but surely they should get used to you, if they bite make a high pitched noise, but don't hurt them of course, they have excellent memories too, so if you do something that they don't like chances are they'll remember, Im sure you will have them tame in no time at all, just don't be afraid, if your going to pet them don't move your hand away as if they are going to bite you, if anything stick that finger right in there face.    Good luck, its such a selfless thing you are doing, I wish more people were like yourself.|`|IFGSOd16aa	rats almost never bite!!!!! But yours were in a shelter and are prob scared. They are very smart. I had one and i loved her alot.  frankley she died last night and i was crying alot!!! you just get so attachet! she was just a baby to! well rats really do need out of the cage time. try to make it aleast an hour. Put the cage on your bed or you can put a blanket on your table and then put the cage on it anyway you like. well just let them come out slowly give them time. there old. to get close to mine i smushed a banana on my fingers and let her lick it off. she liked it! well i hope that helps. Dont give up on them!!!|`|34sidlx2aa	Rats dont poo any more then other rodents, though they are larger so their poo my be more noticeable.  Its possible to litter train rats,  though usually its easer to do this when they are young.  You may find it more difficult now that they are much older.      To litter train them you will need a wide flat container to act as a litter tray the rats will need to be able to sit in it. The first thing you will need to do is see if you can identify which corner  the rats are using for their toilet,  this is not always obvius as some rats will just go anywhere  particularly males. If they are not using one partial corner just pick one.  Then fill your letter tray with cat litter and put it in the corner put some of the soiled bedding in the litter tray and then clean the cage.  You need to keep the cage as clean as possible so that the only thing that smells is the litter tray.  If your rats poo anywhere but in the litter tray pick up the dropping and put them in the tray.   Eventually your rats should get the idea.      Regarding handling, rats benifit from interaction with people and if you can handle them then you should do so as much as posible.  as a way of getting them used to peopel keep the rats cage in a room where there is a lot of activities.        Try letting them free roam in a room where they can be safely contained. The bathroom may be a good place for this,  remove anything from the floor that could be dangerous and make sure there are no holes they can squeeze through, then just let them run round.  If you sit on the floor will they are running round they will gradually get used to your presences.      When you do want to pick them up avoid surprising them rats have poor eyesight and may panic if there is suddenly a huge hand coming into there cage.  Make sure they are aware that you are there, try talking to them. As you open the cage door.  Rats generally use their sense of smell to identify things so let them smell your fingers before you pick them up.  when you do go to pick them up avoid trying to chase them round the cage.  Be confident and firm, use both hands put one behind them and one in front and scoop them up with your hands underneath.      If they have had a difficult life it may take a long time and a lot of patients to get them to trust you.     Just one word of  caution.  At 2 ? years old they will be approaching the end of their lives. Few rats live beyond 3 years.  If you do take them on make sure that you can afford the vets bills, which can be high

He has also appeared in Garfield and Friends, two live-action feature films, and two CGI films.    He is a kind but dumb yellow-furred, brown-eared beagle. In the live-action films based on the Garfield franchise, he is played by a dachshund. In the comic of August 26, 2007, Garfield describes Odie's species as "purebred clown" after trying to find out what kind of dog Odie is with the help of a book. [1]    Odie usually has a large tongue and slobbers in his appearances. Recently, as of 2000, he is seen walking on two feet instead of all fours, just like Garfield.    In the television series, Odie's appearance is usually announced by the sound of the cavalry's bugling.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	The more torpedo shaped the fish, the more likely it is to tolerate strong currents! So yes, all Danio species, some Tetra species (NOT neons), some Barbs such as Tinfoils, some Loach species such as Dojos, even some species of Pleco.     There's also fan shrimp too like Bamboo shrimp, they'll position themselves in the current to filter food from the water column.|`|PqT6pQAoaa	I agree with catx, the more torpedo shaped fish usually can withstand fast current.

DhiwcfVbaa	no lettuce! until it's a bit older. any veg  you feed make sure you feed a small amount and build it up to more, dont just give a huge pile of veg. When they are little they have more sensitive digestive systems as they are not used to a lot of veg. they can get diarrhoea more easily too, which can be fatal! rabbits can and will eat just about anything, even stuff which is prob not good for them. i wouldnt reccomend orange peel, my bunny loved eating candles (which i didnt feed to him, i found him muching on one once!) so they dont know what is good for them lol! But any of this: broccoli, kale, cabbage, carrot, celery, turnip, parsnip, swede, sprouts, apple, pear, melon, banana, grass, dandylions, clover, chickweed, docks, coltsfoot, plantain (not the banna things), some will eat oranges. dont feed: cherries, plum. check out this site too, its useful http://www.mybunny.org/info/fruitveg.htm|`|u61yKsE3aa	Veggies and fruits are great to add to you rabbits diet just go slow.  most fruits are good but I would avoid citrus fruits and don't let them have the seeds of other fruits.  Veggies avoid to high of fiber (no spinach)  lettuce is okay  in moderation.  NEVER give ice-burg it is horrible.  My rabbit used to love squash and cantaloupe each rabbit will have their own taste. Good Luck|`|bKwQyCEHaa	Holland Lop?         ommm............|`|339NqJ84aa	I wouldn't feed him any orange peel. Iceburg lettuce is the WORST vegetable, for rabbits and humans.    I never recommend canned veggies, they are not as healthy as fresh or frozen veggies and are aways covered in a watery slim.    Fresh or thawed frozen veggies..    carrots  green beans  cauliflower  broccoli  parsnip  cucumbers  corn     apples  bananas  cranberries   blueberries    Always remember: Feed in moderation!
N6NunLGVaa	yes they bury them but then they just leave. like everyone else said you better hope there some were moist/humid. move her shelter to another part of the cage (if its near there) and just take them out and get them in the incubator. be careful though the eggs are very fragile. good luck!  ?  Kaitlyn|`|7ZsMMkp5aa	They bury them and leave. I hope she laid them in a moist spot and not just on the sand. If it is in a moist cup or deli cup, place it on a heat pad so it stays on 82-86 degrees until your peat moss is ready. Don't let the eggs get too cold. But no, she will not take care of them. Also, DO NOT TOUCH THEM YOURSELF!|`|nooi0ldjaa	they bury them in the wild to keep predators away, yes that's normal. the females in the wild bury them and that's the end of it. they don't nurse the baby's and watch over them or anything.    you said shes burying them? what do you have that she is using to bury them in? because if you have sand or walnut dust or wood chips your leo will get in-packed and die. trust me i made that mistake once..and only once.    keep the eggs moist and warm, if not they'll die.    also, i hope you know not to keep the babys in with the mother/father...and i hope you have tanks for each baby. if not get your shovel ready...|`|nI8G21y8aa	you need to hurry up and get that incubator. get those eggs out of there. you better hope that they are in a humid spot.   did you breed her? if you didn't then the eggs could be infertile and you could just throw the eggs away.    in the wild she doent take care of them, she jst leaves|`|bqZQxYUraa	They bury them and leave.

UT9Wlu5Faa	Yes. fish that are semi-aggresive seems to become more aggressive when the water quality is poor. This is probably due to them wanting more oxygen in the water.|`|CphIBXMaaa	Clean your tank please!|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	The water quality being bad won't be helping. Why is it bad? Make it not bad! Bad water kills.    Gold Gouramis are notoriously territorial and aggressive, chances are, as it matures and demands a more of a territory, that poor Dwarf Gourami will continue to be harassed and bullied, possibly to it's end.|`|vAwzvNgzaa	Poor water quality can kill. The question should be how can you clear it up.|`|i1JVe24Oaa	put it into perspective: are you in a good mood when you have to breathe highly polluted smog?    there's your answer
bf04eda87a4053f72857e70e26cc077faa	Angel fish are terretorial and tend to out grow their space.  I would stick with one angel not two.  Also, the kissing gouramies get pretty big.  I would forget them and go for either a blue gourami, orange gourami or sunburst gourami.  If you got the extra dwarf, one angel, one more gourami, you would be ok.  Then you can add something different like a tri-color (bali) shark, irredecent shark, redtail shark, black shark or rainbow shark.  I have kept sharks and gouramis for years no problem.  Or, try a silver dollar, a danio, or an australian rainbow.  I have also added into this mix two black tetras, or a rosy barb.      When figuring out how many fish you can have, you don't count plecos, or cat fish.|`|MJW7Etk3aa	lol nobody knows crap on yahoo i have 1 angel, 2 kissing gouramis, 3 plecos 2 bristle nose one blue phantom, few catfish some about 8 inches,african climbing perch, 2 knife fish and they have all been fine in my 20 gallon tank, i have had my kissing gouramis for 5 years and there 6 inches long. don't get an iridescent shark like legal bgl said they grow to like 3-4 foot lol other than that its ok.|`|As7Sw8VRaa	good|`|3TVUP1xcaa	i wouldn't add anymore fish maybe one more gourami thats it|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	I would leave the angels out. But other then that I would add the rest of them. Just keep an eye on the ammonia, ph, nitrate and nitrite levels. Also watch the amount you are feeding them. Other then that I see no problems. The other folks are just being wary about the 1 inch of fish to 1 gallon of water rule. Also if you keep the angels and gouramis for awhile they will get very big.     Most of the answers are just going by the question and assuming that you have now experience at all. My best advice is that you just be careful. More fish means the tank will get dirtier faster.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Angelfish are too big. They get about 6-7 inches long, and from top to bottom they can get around 10 inches. Kissing gouramis grow to 12 inches. So thats another big no.    What kind of pleco do you have? Common plecos can easily grow to 24 inches. If possible, skip anymore gouramis. If you crowd them, they will fight each other.    Get a school of small tetras or something else.|`|hFyodb4Daa	Way too much!!!    Angelfish need at least a 30 gallon tank of 16 inches tall    Kissing Gouramis are very aggressive and need a 50 gallon tank they will kill both gouramis in your 20 gallon    Your pleco is most likely a common which grows 12-24 inches long and needs 50-75 gallon tank    Once you get rid of the pleco you can try another dwarf gourami and 6 cories/ottos|`|dE5fs9yzaa	I would leave out the kissers..they get pretty big. No more then two small angels more I would say.|`|NHs3LxlLaa	Common pleco's and kissing gouramis can grow to be huge (1ft+) so wouldn't suit a 20 Gallon tank. If it's a bristle nose pleco it might be okay. No angelfish because they grow rather large also but you could but in some harlequin rasboras, neon tetras, black phantom tetras or some corydoras.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	No. It will be a miserable life for that Goldfish. All fish need a filter, daily water changes are extremely stressful for fish, a filter and weekly water changes is far healthier for them.    Fantail Goldfish should do the majority of their growing in the first couple of years of their life, keeping one in such a tiny tank even for a few months could cause irepairable damage. They really do need around 20 gallons at least.    If you want a fish in a 4 gallon pretty much your only option is a Betta BUT they must also have a heater and a filter. And every filtered tank must complete the nitrogen cycle beforehand.    If you cannot afford a filter or larger tank, then maybe it's not the right time for fish. Fish are far from being cheap pets, I dread to think how much I've spent on my tanks.    edit: A 1" fish is a baby. A fancy Goldfish generally grows between 6"-8" in length excluding fins. And that combined with it producing a HUGE amount of waste, it needs as much water as possible!     Bruce the Oranda didn't get the memo about growth for fancy Goldfish though:  http://cellar.org/2002/recordgoldfish.jp...|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Hello,  it's not really, you'd never be off cleaning your tank to keep the nitrates down, poo factories that they are.  Plus, you will be amazed by how quickly fancytails grow.      If you are going cold water and you have no other stock in your tank, why not get white cloud mountain minnows.  They are interesting feisty little fish.    If you go small tropical, you can get some beautiful critters.  Or a beta and some of the larger shrimps.      Other than that, occasionally, you can get a big tank for a good price on e-bay when you do come to upgrade - but then if you are struggling for space, I can advise the tropicals.|`|ToztjpAsaa	He'll be lonely.  Get him a friend!|`|hFyodb4Daa	The one inch of fish ger gallon rule is crap and desn't apply to goldfish One fancy goldfish needs a 20 gallon(it grows up to 10 inches long) and every other fancy goldfish needs 10 gallons and goldfish grow somewhat fast for the fantail won't last for a year also it isn't healthy for the fish to have a water change every day some have even died from this since benefical bacteria have no time to settle and than again they poop alot so your in a lose-lose situation without a filter so you need to get one right away|`|bDPVRtCNaa	If you do not have the money or the space than I think it would be best to wait. It would not be fair to make the goldfish live in terrible conditions and wait to be bought an appropriate home.    Twenty gallons is not excessive for one fancy goldfish. It is just right:  ~Goldfish are massive waste producers. It has been said that they produce 40% more waste than other fish. They give off ammonia which is lethal in any amount. In an appropriately sized, cycled aquarium, beneficial bacteria will aid in breaking down their waste, and the size of the tank will help dilute it as well. The bacteria lives in the substrate and the filter media of the tank.     ~In good conditions a goldfish should grow fairly quickly. Keep in mind that the fish you see in the pet stores are only juveniles. Much of their growth occurs in the first year. Fancy goldfish may grow 6-8 inches, and live well beyond 10 years.     Why smaller tanks are not healthy-  ~Spending a year in such a tiny tank will stunt it's growth. Stunting means that the body will cease to grow but the organs continue. It is seriously unhealthy and will shorten the fish's lifespan.|`|2ZUDlLCjaa	ye tank is cool but tip fancy goldfish after breeding thier bladder is in a different place to where they dhould be and tend to swimm at an angle i reccomed a comet fish they are the first goldfish found and are much more hardy than fancy and change water out every 1 week put bactira in every 2 change water 1/4 of contents unless is quite cloudy i have that similar tank fancy lived for bout 2 dais and comet lived about 2 week lol i would recomend this tank http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?V... i have similar one i have plastic one that is glass it brill u can have about 2 comets but if u reli want fancy 1 only just . or get danios or wcmm i have wcmm and danios in mine 2 dans and 2 wcmm fine size ur tank will be bit biger about 5-7 danios or wcmm thanks|`|As7Sw8VRaa	yes|`|41MFERq7aa	no fancy gold fish need at least 20 gallons a 4 gallon is good for a betta|`|VRkR4BTOaa	yea you should be fine goldsifh arent that big they rly only need a gallon per fish so you should be fine|`|PqT6pQAoaa	Absolutely not!  A filter is needed for a goldfish cuz they make a lot of mess. Changing the water everyday can lead to stress. 4 gallon is waay too small. A goldfish needs at least 20 gallons. However, a 4 gallon tank is perfect for one male betta fish. Please rescue these poor fish from the stores. They are usually separated in those tiny containers. You will make a betta so happy if he gets a bigger home :)    If you dont like bettas, you can put 4 fancy guppies or 4 neon tetras.|`|7fdcd76738d2afbc3ff09cd9c935148baa	not really, the fantail will grow to 4-5inches in a fairly short space of time, if it lives that long.|`|uPJ1f9UIaa	NO!!!!!!!!! don't do that goldfish need at least 10-20 gallons . 4 gallons is good for a betta fish. And goldfish need a filter the most they poop like crazy they don't proses food like other fish.
Hxa0lXb3aa	Well if you put some gravel in the bacteria would get a little in your tank. You should still cycle it. Or the tank water looks cloudy and your fish will die cause they bacteria isn't changing the ammonia into nitrite which isn't getting turned into nitrate.     Best Wishes~

w4DIPHf1aa	if it's not a special bulb for planted tanks then replace it when it really dims out.    It could last many years easy.    If its for a planted tank then every 2-3  years is good|`|H06PtiIAaa	depends on what type of tank and lighting.    My saltwater tanks with corals i change about every 8 months.    But on my fish only, as long as the bulb is on.|`|2w4Otk8vaa	I just wait until they go out, but i guess you could do it once a year, thats about how long they last.|`|VCCzAyvsaa	Wow, that is way too general to give a specific answer. It really depends on the lightbulb.
0HAn67yZaa	here are a few good choices..        an american eskimo dog....  The American Eskimo Dog is intelligent, alert, and friendly, although slightly conservative. They are never overly shy nor aggressive. He is protective of its home and family, although he does not threaten to bite or attack people. They are naturally wary of strangers, but once introduced, they become instant friends.      Average Height: 17 Inches    Average Weight: 28 Pounds   Health Issues: Reasonably healthy breed. Could develop eye problems. Prone to hip dysplasia.   Training: Easily trained.   Living Conditions: Will function well in an apartment but must receive plenty of exercise. A small yard would be fine. Not comfortable in warm weather.   Life Expectancy: 12 - 15 Years               a beagle....  Extremely friendly, great with children and strangers. He does however require constant attention and affection and does not like to be left alone. An excellent choice for a family pet. Generally good with other dogs, but should not be trusted with non-canine pets. Beagles have minds of their own. They are determined and watchful and require patient, firm training.      Average Height: 14 Inches    Average Weight: 24 Pounds   Health Issues: Can be prone to heart, epilepsy, eye, back & leg problems.   Training: Can be a very stubborn dog, therefore somewhat difficult to train.   Living Conditions: Very active indoors and out. Will do fine in an apartment but should be exposed to much outdoor exercise and play.   Life Expectancy: 12 - 15 Years               a keeshond....  The Keeshond is a happy dog by nature. They are extremely affectionate. When a Keeshond joins the family, he looks forward to being an important part of it. He loves children and will gladly play games and bounce around with them.      Average Height: 18 Inches    Average Weight: 45 Pounds   Health Issues: Hip & skin problems, heart disease.   Training: Will require time and patience to train.   Living Conditions: An average size yard is recommended.   Life Expectancy: 12 - 15 Years             a shetland sheepdog...  Because of his small size, the beautiful Sheltie can be happy in the city or the country. These intelligent, loving, and sensitive dogs become deeply attached to their families. Besides being smart, they want to please. They usually get along well with gentle and thoughtful children if raised with them. Exercise caution when considering an adult Sheltie for a family with young children, they may not be compatible. Shelties have a deserved reputation as vocal herding dogs. They often display a terrier-like personality, which tends to be hyper, vocal and always on the go. Other Shelties can just as easily be overly timid. The average Sheltie can be trained to be an excellent watch dog.      Average Height: 15 Inches    Average Weight: 15 Pounds   Health Issues: Epilepsy, heart, eye & bleeding disease, joint disease, skin problems.   Training: Easy to train.   Living Conditions: Will do okay in an apartment.   Life Expectancy: 12 - 15 Years|`|urMivi74aa	On top of all these numbers requirements, the other two things that you should consider in owning a dog are your cousin's personality and lifestyle. let her try this quiz and find out what breed is best for her. goodluck!    http://elfurl.com/3azmf|`|h8OqX12Haa	tell her ot get a pug she will have so much fun with him or her pugs are clowns they are so cute   as for the corgi they need lots of exercise since they are herding breed|`|TYjXGyCzaa	Dachshund or a Pomeranian.|`|h3Muywckaa	How about a Lab or Retriever? They are really friendly but can be quite intimidating. When my lab looks out of the window and sees someone (in the dark, mainly) she barks, loudly.|`|uPJ1f9UIaa	schnoodle|`|BYn5R8aNaa	i like pomeranians|`|PMksnqkxaa	I could guarantee that a Miniature Pinscher wouldn't intimidate anyone. Maybe a English Bull Terrier or English Bulldog?
Ulff1hcDaa	Pit Bulls are wonderful dogs but they are not for everyone!      The biggest concern is the high exercise need. Mine gets 20 minutes on the treadmill in the morning with a weighted back pack. He then gets a short walk when I get home and a longer walk after dinner...both with the weighted back pack. He has a spring pole in the back yard for the in-between times and several tug toys for his very favorite activity...tug-o-war!! A huge chunk of my day is spent on making sure he gets enough exercise.    Next is training. These dogs are heavy and solid. They have to be taught not to jump on people and to be careful with teeth. As with any dog, if he gets too excited while playing there is the possibility of tooth to skin contact. This breed has such powerful jaws that they can hurt someone without even trying. They have to be trained that teeth on skin is never ok....not even when they are little....not even when they are playing. With my dog it's a constant check in to make sure he is calm and focused and listening. He has to sit before I put down his food, he has to be willing to release when in a game of tug-o-war, he has to respond when told to stop...and on and on and on.  This goes well beyond what any dog training class is going to do.    ...and lets not forget socialization! Just seeing a Pit Bull walking towards them is enough to worry some people....a Pit Bull running and jumping on them and/or their pet will likely send them into a complete panic. It is important to train your pup to meet people and other pets with grace and control. I got my dog when he was 1 1/2 years old and this was by far the hardest bad habit to break. It's worth the work though....now when I come home I see a happy dog who sits and waits for his greeting instead of knocking me over in excitement.     Please think long and hard before plunging into a lifetime of living with a Pit Bull. The shelters are full of Pit Bulls who were too much for uninformed owners. They are routinely dumped and are really hard to adopt out. These dogs are not just pets, they are a huge comitment of time and energy.  I can't imagine trying to keep up with my dog's needs while still in school.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	I would encourage your boyfriend to rescue an older Pit Bull- one that tests well with your dog, one that will need less exercise (though, be aware, this is generally a VERY energetic breed).  Disregard what your mother says- she will not be living with the dog and it is none of her business.  Wait and see if she can get past her prejudice and give the dog a chance.    Ideally, any dogs should be separated when you are not home, and this is especially important for Pit Bulls.  Many are trustworthy, but not one hundred percent so.  However, if you are careful and do your research, you shouldn't have a problem.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	I would think problem 1) one is your biggest issue, How is he supposed to devote all this time to the dog, when he is in law school?      It sounds like you both need to wait. If he waited 2 years he can wait longer.|`|MURxMnLtaa	Most pitties are great big babies.....You don't have to get a puppy, a pit rescue would be able to help you find the right dog for your family, even one that's been proven to be good with small dogs....Any big dog can go after small dogs, not just a pit.  An adult or young adult is just as trainable as a puppy, and you don't have to go through the puppy chewing up everything and potty training....I've met a bunch of wonderful rescue pits in my time.|`|eiJY15Teaa	well my cousin has a pitbull and it is the most loving dog iv ever seen.  you just have to train it right.  train it to live and be around your dog.  or you can like seperate them.  im sure your mom will warm up to it when you get it.  they are adorable.  the thing is you just have to train it right.|`|RNqHUNgEaa	That's a tough one. Waiting is obviously the best approach, but when you want something that much, it's hard to wait.    What is your schedule like? If you could move in together and you could watch the puppy that would be okay, but that might not work.    You could try to hire a dog sitter, or just pay a friend to look after the puppy for times when neither one of you can. A puppy can be left alone for short periods if you have a crate for the dog. An 8 week old puppy shouldn't be alone for periods longer than 1-2 hours depending on how needy the dog is. As it gets older it can stay alone for longer periods.    For  2, I wouldn't be worried about leaving them together. They are very sweet and as long as they have been socialized (which isn't very difficult) I wouldn't be worried with leaving them together. And if it is a problem, you could put one in the kitchen/bathroom/spare bedroom, etc.     For  3, socialization is very important. Introduce the puppy to several new situations, new people, and new dogs. This will make a happy, well adjusted dog that will be friendly and outgoing. People will be less afraid of a happy, tail-wagging, smiling pit bull, then they would be of a shy, more nervous one.|`|ggX5nO0haa	Pits are amazing family dogs that have been known to watch children closely and lovingly. In England they are called the 'nanny' dog, if that gives you any hint as to how good they are with children. As for small dogs, if they are raised with them, like any other dog, they should be fine with them. My pit was very friendly with people, children, other dogs of any size. he was a great dog.     As for your neighbor, seeing your dog as a puppy will be a good thing for her. She can get to know it as a young dog before it gets to the size that killed her dog. The dog that probably killed hers was out of control, treated badly and didn't have the correct training.     The problem I see with your arragment is that you won't be home to socialize with this puppy. Pits need constant human contact, walking is essential, as is training. If you don't have the time, than don't get one, put it off until you have the time for the puppy.|`|7vJNHaskaa	1.He should wait until he has time to put into the dog before he gets one (after law school).     2. I'm sure if you raise the pit bull with your dog, they will be fine together.     3. Don't worry about your mom, no offense, but it's not her dog, if you have it and it's friendly, she should come around to liking it.    Good luck!!|`|AA11900592	Since your neighbor's dog was attached by a pit bull she will never like the breed. Have you checked the laws in your area to see if they allow you to own a Pit Bull, many don't, and if they do you must have special insurance in case the dog was to bite someone. I would NEVER trust a Pit Bull with a little dog either. Plus with the many reports of Pit Bull dogs attacking you never know. I would NOT take the risk.|`|fhf9Pnp1aa	ok i just have to stress pit bulls are GREAT GREAT dogs the only reason why they fight when they are trained to is because they want to please their owners.they want to please their owners sooo bad they are willing to kill for them.and i had a pit bull... greatest dog ive ever haddd.she was soo great i kept  her in with my small baby gaoats,chickens and my horse.sshe loved them and she protected them.im just telling you pit bulls are great dogsss|`|p6rgKan6aa	tell him not to think about what he wants and to also think about the dog like will he play with the dog 2 hours a day like in the morning then later on at night because dogs need lots of attention .i have a lab and shes a very good dog. and labs are loving playful cuddley and VERY smart but when they are under a year old thats the hardest time .so i say get a lab if he realy wants one .but if hes to bizy then dont get one.and its not the neighbors chose .|`|AA12149194	I think that number one would be the main problem and that he should probably wait until he gets out of Law School and can devote the time needed to the dog.    Number two can be solved simply by crate training the Pit Bull... It's true that Pits shouldn't be left alone with another dog, even if they do get along with it... But again, crate training can easily solve that problem.    Number three... You can't force your mother to change her mind. That will either come in time, or not at all.. Pit bulls are fantastic dogs. They love people and want nothing more than to please their owners. They have been bred to be people friendly, to be companions, and they definitely are... Most Pits that I've come across think that they're over-sized lap dogs, mine included. They're also very active dogs and require exercise, they're not a lazy breed by any means.  The only thing that you can really do is introduce the dog to your mother and hope that her opinion changes eventually... You can also do your research, learn about the breed, and educate her on them as well.  Obedience training is, more often than not, a must for the breed. Your boyfriend sounds like he won't hesitate to enroll him/her in classes. If he's done his research and he knows what to expect, what he needs to do and is willing to spend the money to get a well bred Pit Bull, then you really have nothing to worry about.    Like I said... They're wonderful family dogs.. But they require responsible, knowledgeable owners that are willing to put in the time and effort needed.|`|DYxb7P3Baa	well, i think your bf shouldnt get the pitbull YET. cuz if hes at law school and stuff, he wont have time for the dog, and it might get mistreated and not turn out the way you want it to. wait till he graduates, and then he'll have more time with the dog, so that he can train it or spend more time to make sure it doesnt develop some sort of aggression. if you don't spend enough time with a puppy to train it properly, then don't get it cuz it might actually ruin the dog.    with proper care and training, i believe your bf can train his future pitbull to be a good dog ;)  good luckk ! :)|`|AA12260752	If you get the pit as a puppy, your other dog shouldn't be an issue.  The pit will grow up with that dog in the home and just know that's how it is.  As far as your mom is concerned I'm not sure why that's an issue....you are not dating your mom right?  The decision whether to get the pup or not should not be based on anything your mom thinks.|`|wLZsPYh9aa	it ont really a solution but whatever  did you know that there was a study and the pit bull breed is the least likly breed to bite a person  hopefully it helps some how|`|peherxTzaa	I've owned 5 pit bulls (i'm 22), And I love them. All of mine were very good with other dogs. If you adopt a pitbull from a shelter the outcome from that will most likely be the best because shelters do not let people adopt, un-adoptable pets.  Recently I adopted my newest addition lexy who is a pitt bull and my 6 week old kitten trys to breast feed off her all the time. I have two cats and my pitt bull and they all get along fine. Pitt bulls do scale fences tho. Mine has jumped our fence many times.

Keep dog outside until it takes care of business.Take out after feeding.

Get a book on dog training and stay consistant with it!|`|6c72e810c38f0fa856b4ce67b591ff0eaa	treats...a clicker....and a clicker training book...simple and easy...my dog learned so fast with the clicker but you have to learn how to click it at the right time and then give a treat...your dog will realize that when you use the clicker you like what he or she is doing and your dog will get the hang of it...|`|MKRemZkuaa	You could designate a place in the yard for him to go.

e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	It is not recommended because  A. It is never recommended to house 2 different species together.  They will stress each other out or injure each other    B. They have different diets and it would be hard to ensure each is getting what it needs    and C. Yes, they DO need different environments.  It is not just an animal's environment that matters, but their micro environment.  An animal's environment in the wild may broadly be classified as Tropical rain forest, or even more specifically a certain acre of tropical rainforest in a certain region of Brazil, but their micro-environment may be in the leaf litter at a certain elevation and under a certain tree species.  The temperature, moisture, and food sources under the leaf litter would be specific to that exact area, we are talking a matter of cubic feet in some cases.  In captivity, it is the micro-environment, not the general environment that keepers have to approximate as closely as they can.    Your yard is a big place, they can come and go as they please.  The yard can contain more micro-environments than you could ever successfully recreate in a comparatively much smaller space.  And you have to get everything 100% perfect for both, since they can't wander off to the proper location like they can in the wild.    Sorry for the long-winded Ecology lesson|`|xoXkHOVsaa	It is never a good idea to house species together.  Skinks are solitary so they would probably show aggression to each other.  Also, a skink needs a 55 gallon habitat, I doubt he wants to share with your beardy.|`|40qTdKuPaa	Yeah, you can.|`|u61yKsE3aa	I wouldn't.  While you see them both in your back yard they don't spend all their time there.  Skinks tend to be solitary and like to burrow while beardies tend to prefer to be on top and males can be very territorial  you said you cage is 6 feet long how wide.  If it is wide enough you can divide it giving each lizard a separate half.  Before you do this though quarantine the new lizard to make sure no parasites or disease.  Good Luck|`|nI8G21y8aa	no. never house 2 different species together in the same tank. BADDD IIIDDDEEEAAA    DO RESEARCH  no dont do that,your asking for a dead lizzard|`|QZ3eucYWaa	Unfortunately this will just not work out as well as you would like it to in the end. Even if you get them out and let them run around together and they seem to get along and seem fine, if you confine them in a space that they cannot get out of they will eventually get territorial and fight.   Your not even supposed to house beardie's together let alone housing it with another type of lizard.
f11a19fa99304eb27150d691dcdf2079aa	Solo el 20% del perro es hereditario en cuanto a su personalidad, o sea, hereda el temperamento. As, el 80% restante le corresponde al due?o. Independientemente de la raza, si mantienes encadenado y aislado a un perro seguramente ser agresivo. El pitbull tiene esa tendencia a defender lo suyo con un poco ms de fuerza que otras razas, pero eso no quiere decir que sea agresivo, y en s su "agresividad" se concentra hacia otros perros, no personas. Desde peque?o socializalo con otros perros y gente, as se acostumbra, lo peor que puedes hacer es aislarlo del resto del mundo, porque despus por puro instinto (como pasara con cualquier otro perro) atacar a lo desconocido.

Es cierto que los pitbull tienen una componente genetica que conlleva una mayor predisposicin a la agresividad, pero eso no significa necesariamente que sean peligrosos. La educacin juega un rol fundamental en este sentido: necesitan reglas claras y firmes desde el comienzo, pero lo peor que se puede hacer es aislarlos o reprimirlos con la violencia. Lo mejor sera integrarlos en la vida familiar usando el metodo del "refuerzo positivo", premiandolos por las acciones positivas, mas que concentrarse en los castigos. Necesitan una referencia firme eso si, y un curso de adiestramiento no estara de mas, pero para el resto, los ms importante es el sentido comun y por supuesto todo el carino que uno pueda brindarle.|`|63fc1c23532e56bea62b8ab2152a9191aa	no se de donde seas.. pero en estados unidos es ilegal esos perros.. ya que por el cruce que tiene.. han creado algo asi como un pequeno monstruo ajjaja si lo amarras y lo dejas aislado cualquieraa se pone agresivo no crees? y mas los perros..el que te regalo eso es en verdad un inconsciente.. yo tu lo regalo o lo dejas en un refugio no se si tengas ni?os en casa... es muy peligroso cuando crecen..no has visto las noticia.. que  esos perros atacan hasta lo caballos..y no sueltan a su presa hasta que no los mata y los deje en pedazo..|`|babe38180671f85b7cc7990cf3305e7aaa	los perros no son agresivos si los educan bien dales nobleza y te daran nobleza. dales agresividad y te dara agresividad.desgraciadamente la fama ya la tienen pero es mera fama.eso si cuando lo saques a pasear mas de alguna persona le va ha tener desconfianza.dale cari?o y demuestrale a la gente que por el hecho de ser una raza marcada como agresiva no necesariamente es agresivo suerte es muy buen perro|`|rq8NsdrDaa	Hola, los pitbulls bien entrenados no son ms agresivos que otra raza de perros, tienes que considerar que va a necesitar mucha atencin, espacio y cuidados, si an as decides que el pitbull es para t, entonces debers considerar:  1. Dedicarle tiempo para pasearlo y consentirlo diario, pero no lo encadenes, eso es crueldad animal (si no tienen actividad fsica fuerte se ponen medio estresados, cuando son cachorros si los dejas solos por largos perodos les da por hacer travesuras)  2. Tienes que socializarlo con humanos y perros y gatos ahora que es peque?o y as pueda verlos como amigos y no como enemigos.  3. Vas a necesitar collar de castigo en lugar de collar regular para sacarlo a pasear toda su vida, tienen una fuerza impresionante y pues si eres mujer, con collar regular te arrastrar cuando sea adulto, puede estar muy educado, pero es un perro efusivo que gusta de correr como loco. . .no se hacen da?o, no son tontos, al primer jaloncito que se d el solo, pues frena su comportamiento. . .tambin necesita arns, collar regular y bozal (lo del bozal casi es para que las personas histricas no estn molestandote en la calle).  4. Necesita sus propios peluches, carnaza para morder, pelotas y todo lo que le quieras dar porque es muy juguetn y disfruta atesorar.  5. Son muy sanos pero de piel delicada, as que hay que adquirir toda clase de repelentes para insectos.  6. Los pitbulls pasan una infancia larga, as que preparate para 2 a?os de fuerza y juegos desmedidos. . .despus hay que andarlos empujando para que no sean tan flojos.    Y mucho tiempo y dedicacin, yo tengo una pitbull de 4 a?os que es un encanto, muy protectora con sus 6 hermanos gatos y sus 2 amigos perros de los vecinos, si ve cachorros se los quiere robar para llenarlos de mimos, se pliega ante sus caprichosos gatos. . .con las visitas es muy simptica. . .en fin, es buena perra, no ha matado a ningn animalito pero si responde si un perro extra?o se pone agresivo, pero un buen jaln de collar y arns y vuelve a obedecer, porque eso s me es absolutamente leal y lo nico que quiere es complacerme.|`|Ftob4Qmtaa	Que barbaro !!!!

The cleaning crew will have a hell of a time scraping me off the floor tonight.  How preciously adorable...I'm sure they'll go in a nanosecond...make sure those little ones go to homes that know about them!!    I would say that they are Malamute mix pups, actually.  Seem to large to be Huskies.  Then again, we can only really see the face, so who knows?  But that's my .02.  :-)|`|7vJNHaskaa	I would say they look like Husky pups then.

THEY ARE SOOOOOOO CUTE!!!|`|px6du98zaa	They're definitely a mix of one of the arctic breeds and another.  It's hard to tell if its malamute or husky because you can't really see the size and don't know the age.    I'd say though because they are so young and their coat is already that full more on the malamute side.  All the huskies I have dealt with don't get that fluff for a while.  Could be wrong though.  But they definitely have something else in them, hence the floppy ears.    Adorable though!!

T8OFsBUUaa	Has there been any major changes in the household? Kids leaving, kids being born, family members death? Changes usually bring on something like that.    Or could be she suddenly has a problem with her gums and needs to chew more, so you may want to consult a vet.    Or, maybe she is just doing in because she likes it. In which case, you have to find something more interesting for her to chew. New toys, stuffed kong, something like that.|`|nZBVbVbkaa	wow, smart dog. You should totally put that video on youtube!    But back to your question, if you get her desexed, that may help her calm down alot, but after 8 years, she doesnt have much left in her.... She could also just be bored around the house and wants stimulation - has something changed within the past 3 months? Like, a new job, longer hours, less people home at a time, dog receives less attention, neighbours move house? I would start off by getting the dog a couple of toys to play with, give it treats every couple of days, and take it for a run/walk at least once a day. Labs are very active dogs and need to keep themselves occupied. You could even try getting another dog, so then your lab has a constant friend that she can play with|`|jem0fyhiaa	well get her some chew toys!!!|`|3qckOFWIaa	In a pack, the leader is allowed to leave, however, the followers never leave the leader. If your dog is instinctually seeing you as their follower and you leave him, it causes so much mental anguish that a dog often takes it out on your house or himself. The dog sees itself as the one who is responsible for the pack and when the pack has left the house they get in a panic because they are afraid that something might happen to their pack members. When a dog accepts you as pack leader separation anxiety will not exist
pMob9CIDaa	My cat does that too, especially when he is playing or staring at something through the window. He doesnt seem to be upset whenever it happens.|`|VPycXVIlaa	It's normal.

I've never been good at naming my own dogs, much less someone else's.... I'd recommend waiting until you get her and then seeing which fits her. You can wait a little bit and decide on her name when it comes to you.    I named my Pit Bull after a character in a series of books that I've been reading for 4-5 years... It's the last name of the main character, which is Faber. The character fit her personality but I didn't really think that the first name did, so I went with the last.

bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	No No No No.    Dogs are carnivores. They should be fed as such. Yes they may "live" that way, but they are never truely healthy.    You can be vegan but don't push that onto your dog. Feed him the he was meant to be fed.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	No, dogs should NOT be put on vegetarian diets. It is unnatural and also unhealthy for them. Dogs aren't cows, goats, sheep etc..they are carnivores..meat eaters...designed to extract proper nutrition from meats not veggies & grains.  http://b-naturals.com/Aug2003.php    "Research has proven that a strictly vegetarian diet, or even a diet too low in meat, can cause diseases in cats and dogs. An often-fatal heart disease in cats and some dogs was shown to be caused by a deficiency of an amino acid only found in meat called taurine. Blindness is another symptom of taurine deficiency." From: http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6277435...    There has also been research done on dilated cardiomyopathy that suggests taurine deficiency as the culprit. This taurine deficiency was found most often in vegan diets.|`|AA11280525	Ummmm..... you dont need to ask the same question twice,its distracting and uneeded!There are other questions to answer-and if you take up all the room on the same question,then poeple with different questions dont get the answer they deseve!at lest wait two day-and if you dont get any answers-then ask agian!But mostly the same 100 poeple with good answers-are on every day!  But to answer your question,i wouldnt,dogs need meat,it is always been that way!Dog foods that dont contain meat are looked very low upon!But..*****Can dogs live healthy and active lives on vegetarian food? YES! We have fed numerous dogs a completely vegetarian diet (vegan) for 10 years. Furthermore, numerous studies cited throughout this book give support to this practice. Thus, since grains, vegetables, and cruelty-free supplements can meet all of a dog's needs, why not choose the diet that causes as little suffering as possible?   This book will enable you to create healthy and delicious vegetarian meals for your canine friends. If you would rather purchase a commercial vegetarian dog food (see resources), you will gain confidence and the ability to discuss your choice with others.   Proper nutrition is not   related to a meat-based diet. *******    But i would not put my dog on a vegie diet-i would rather my dog have a shorter happier life with meats and foods he likes then a sad life with vegies for a main meal-but thats just me  :)    Here are some other sites!  http://www.ehow.com/how_5339_dog-vegetar...   http://www.k9care.com/Tip-Vegetarian Dogs.htm   http://www.diet-haven.com/Diets/diet-dog...   http://www.vegsoc.org/info/dogfood1.html   http://www.dognutrition.com|`|116ed7431575eb1d31a4f1cf889dc190aa	Yes, as in humans, much healthier.Can dogs be Vegetarian?  Most of you will agree that dogs are meat-eaters by design.  The ecological niche of their ancestors was to provide a way to strengthen the herbivores by weeding out the sick and the weak, therefore keeping a balance of population.  Dogs (and Wolves) being predators, rely on eating a high protein diet.  Their digestive systems are well adapted to breaking down proteins and using them efficiently.  After relating this though, how does being a vegetarian fit into this lifestyle?  The answer is, surprising, not so hard at all!  STEP 1: Buy a natural health book for dogs or, better yet, one that specializes in vegetarian diets. Follow the diet given. STEP 2: Make sure your dog is getting enough of all the amino acids he needs and vitamin B-12. For this reason it's important to follow a prescribed diet. STEP 3: Speak to your vet about testing your dog's urine periodically. You can do it at home very simply, and there are products on the market for this purpose. A vegetarian diet can make a dog's urine more alkaline; this may predispose them to urinary tract infections. STEP 4: Give your dog cranberry capsules if the urine is too alkaline. This will make it more acidic and help prevent urinary tract infections. STEP 5: Buy a prepared, high-quality vegetarian dog food. This is a good alternative if you're unsure what to feed your dog or don't have time to properly prepare a homemade meal. STEP 6: Supplement with veggie dog treats and biscuits. These are available at most health food or pet stores. STEP 7: Find a veterinarian who supports your decision and who is knowledgeable about vegetarian diets.|`|AA12215378	No, dogs are natural preditors and require meat protien to be heathy.  Dogs do eat plants in the wild, bark for fibre berries for sweets and grass for worming they will eat wheat aslo. There is a vegitarian dog food out there for dogs who have alergies it takes protiens from plants, but those arent taken in to the dogs body as easily. Dogs are very prone to anemia. They need the meat for protien and iron even if it comes from a kibble.|`|xZy05taKaa	Not even Vegans should be on a vegetarian diet. Why would anyone want to do that to a carnivorous animal?         Meat, milk, butter and cheese are all avoided by vegans   Putting children on strict vegan diets is "unethical" and could harm their development, a US scientist has argued.     Lindsay Allen, of the US Agricultural Research Service, attacked parents who insisted their children lived by the maxim "meat is murder".     Animal source foods have some nutrients not found anywhere else, she told a Washington science conference.     The Vegan Society dismissed the claims, saying its research showed vegans were often healthier than meat eaters.     'Development affected'     Professor Allen said: "There have been sufficient studies clearly showing that when women avoid all animal foods, their babies are born small, they grow very slowly and they are developmentally retarded, possibly permanently."       There's absolutely no question that it's unethical for parents to bring up their children as strict vegans     Professor Lindsay Allen, US Agricultural Research Service     "If you're talking about feeding young children, pregnant women and lactating women, I would go as far as to say it is unethical to withhold these foods [animal source foods] during that period of life."     She was especially critical of parents who imposed a vegan lifestyle on their children, denying them milk, cheese, butter and meat.     "There's absolutely no question that it's unethical for parents to bring up their children as strict vegans," she told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).       Missing nutrients     She said the damage to a child began while it was growing in the womb and continued once it had been born.     Research she carried out among African schoolchildren suggests as little as two spoonfuls of meat each day is enough to provide nutrients such as vitamin B12, zinc and iron.     The 544 children studied had been raised on diets chiefly consisting of starchy, low-nutrition corn and bean staples lacking these micronutrients.     This meant they were already malnourished.     Over two years, some of the children were given 2oz supplements of meat each day, equivalent to about two spoonfuls of mince.     Two other groups received either a cup of milk a day or an oil supplement containing the same amount of energy. The diet of a fourth group was left unaltered.      HAVE YOUR SAY    A wide-ranging mixed diet with exercise is essential for any child     James, Cornwall, UK      Send us your views   The changes seen in the children given the meat, and to a lesser extent the milk or oil, were dramatic.     These children grew more and performed better on problem-solving and intelligence tests than any of the other children at the end of the two years.     Adding either meat or milk to the diets also almost completely eliminated the very high rates of vitamin B12 deficiency previously seen in the children.     No quick fixes     Professor Allen stressed that although the study (which was partially supported by the National Cattleman's Beef Association) was conducted in a poor African community that was malnourished, its message was highly relevant to people in developed countries.     She accepted that adults could avoid animal foods if they took the right supplements, but she said adding animal source food into the diet was a better way to tackle malnutrition worldwide than quick fixes with supplements in the form of pills.     "Where feasible, it would be much better to do it through the diet than by giving pills," she said.     "With pills it's very hard to be certain that the quantity of nutrition is right for everybody and it's hard to sustain."     In Africa, good results had been obtained from giving people a dried meat on a stick snack which proved both nutritious and appealing.     Professor Montague Demment, from the University of California at Davis, said more emphasis should be placed on animal source food to combat global malnutrition.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	I just so happen to have been at a seminar about this very subject.  The answer is a big NO!  Neither dogs or cats can live healthy lives on a diet void of meat.The desire of the pets owner to have their pets live the same kind of life style as their brought nothing but harm to their animals.  Some of the repercussions of a total meat free diet are blindness, poor bone development, internal organ shut down, and a thyroid in balance, malnutrition.  If you life is meat free than fine but don't think your pet should have one too.  Your not doing it any favors.|`|G1tHg8Mpaa	if you are a vegatarian you dont eat dogs|`|AMKh4HXyaa	it may be hard but it is probable|`|PQlbtVnLaa	They could but it would be very unhealthy for them.|`|0VRj3M2Saa	Absolutely not.  Dogs requires high amounts of protein that can only be derived from meat or dog food that has been specially formulated.  Vegetables such as legumes and beans do have high amount of protein but these foods are not good for your dog gastronomical system (too much gas).  To really be sure, check with your vet.|`|XoT3B57Caa	Are you serious? Dogs KILL their prey in the wild, and require mean to stay healthy, even domesticated dogs require this. If you put your dog on a vegitarian diet it will be week, and very unhealthy and you will spend a lot of money on vet billy due to the dog being sick all the time.|`|0dbc74fe50ed84c1aade96b76c642005aa	It is possible, but it is not the best diet for a dog.  Dogs are omnivores, not herbivores.  They need protein and the nutrients that meat provides.  I doubt that a dog on a vegetarian diet would live as long, and it would probably have more health problems.

As7Sw8VRaa	Goldfish are generally easy to breed! They are a very social animal and do well when kept in groups.     Goldfish typically shoal, forage and feed in groups and are likely to breed as well. It is best to add oxygenating plants such as Anacharis in the aquarium for the spawning process and for eggs to adhere to.     To induce spawning, the temperature can be slowly dropped to around 11 C (60 F ) and then slowly warmed until they spawn. This is done to mimic the conditions found in nature when spring arrives which is the only time they will spawn in the wild. Feeding lots of high protein food such live brine shrimp and worms during this time will also induce spawning.      Before spawning as the temperature increases, the male will chase the female in a non-aggressive way around the aquarium. This can last for several days. The colors of both fish will intensify, the male somewhat more than the female. During spawning the male will push the female against the plants while both fish gyrate from side to side. This stimulates the female to drop tiny eggs which the male will then fertilize. The eggs will stick to the plants by sticky threads. Spawning can last 2 or three hours and can produce up to 10,000 eggs. The parents, when finished will then eat as many eggs as they can find.     For this reason it is best to remove the parents after spawning is complete. You will need to feed one of the various specialty foods for fry until they become big enough to eat flake or brine shrimp. At first the fry are a dark brown or black color in order to better hide and not be eaten by larger fish. They gain their adult color after several months and can be put in with larger fish once they reach about 1 inch long.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	What kind of goldfish do you want? Comet goldfish need at least 55 gallons for a single fish. Whereas fancy goldfish need at least 20 gallons for a single one. If you provide goldfish its basic needs, they can live 15-20 years.    Tropical is a better option. If you dont have the minimum sized tank for the goldfish, tropical is really the only option. Tropical fish are very hardy. Its best not to put fish in during the cycling process. I have a tank of gouramis and tetras that Ive had running for close to a year now. All of them are doing fine.|`|igpMQn0kaa	Goldfish aren't easier than tropicals at all! Goldfish need a large tank (20-55g) and need heavy-duty water changes weekly to bi-weekly.    Tropicals, on the other hand, can be in small tanks (as small as 2.5g for a betta) and generally need only weekly water changes (unless you get into big fish like oscars). You can get any color combination you want and they can be very easy to breed, depending on the species.    When you're cycling, do this:    Fishless Cycling:  http://www.aquahobby.com/articles/e_fish...    Cycling with fish harms their gills permanently and shortens their lifespan. As long as you cycle before putting in tropicals, they're usually pretty hardy and can take any mistakes you might make.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	how about two tanks? you shouldn't mix tropics with golds. I loved both and at one time had twenty tanks so beware...fish are addictive!|`|NHs3LxlLaa	Tropical fish aren't hard to look after and in my opinion are far better than goldfish. Most tropical fish are way smaller than goldfish, produce less waste and are more compatible with other fish than goldfish. You can do a fish less cycle where you just add ammonia instead of fish waste. The main difference between tropical and goldfish is the temperature of the water. Plus you can house the smaller tropical fish in a smaller tank or have more in larger tank.|`|EHozsofQaa	I'm a beginner too, and I got a betta fish (which is considered tropical, I think) last April because the sales person told me that Betta fish are very tough although they're tropical fish.

I just have to change the water every week and add drops to neutralize the chlorine in the water.|`|7fYZpVcJaa	your right tropical fish are hard to look after and also be costly so i think you should stick with the gold fish
4rwouQHOaa	No. No well bred Siberian should ever show any signs of human aggression at any age. Any Siberian showing such signs needs to be evaluated by a professional trainer ASAP. If the dog being alive is putting others in danger, it needs to be humanly euthanized.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	No, any dogs regardless of age can be dangerous, even if you had it from 3month old, what makes a dangerous dog is lack of trainning, lack of socialising with both people and animals.    myths abouts shelter dogs

If that doesn't work then it may be a behavioral problem if you have other cats.     If you have other cats you should have at least 2 or 3 litter boxes if you have 2 or more cats.    He may not like the litter you provide for him in the litter box. Try using different litters. I had this problem with my cats.    If you have other cats, one of the other ones may have worms or something that's causing your cat to pee everywhere. I also had this problem with my cats.

But the SMB Elites are amazing, my friend has had hers for almost two years now and they just started to show some wear in these past few months.They're great, tons of people from the barn where I board my horse use them.     I wouldn't buy them from that site though... that is really expensive. Your best bet would be to get them from a dealer at a horse show. I plan on getting mine from a tack dealer that is at our bigger NBHA shows, he sells them for about $75 a pair. I think the same guy was at AQHA Congress this past year too. He's great.|`|5TCewPYRaa	They are DEFINITELY worth it---I still have my first pair from when they first came out with them--like 5  years ago or something??

Can you handle dominance/willfulness/timidity/anxiety?  Do you want to buy or adopt?  Do you need a breed that tends to be watchful and wary of strangers, or do you want one that's everyone's best friend from the get go?    Try http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto... for a quiz to help you get some ideas, then read some more about them, contact the breed club, go to some dog shows to see best examples - If you plan to buy pedigree. If you prefer a mixed breed, do the same reading and talking, then visit a shelter and ask if they have any that meet your preferences (exercise, grooming etc) - list the breeds you prefer as examples.     Good luck - a word of warning though - small dogs are prone to separtation anxiety because people treat them like babies (it's cute when  5lb ball of fluff jumps up and sleeps on your pillow - it's still cute at full size ( whole what, 10-14lb?) but when a weimaraner or great dane does the same thing it's out of order. You have to discipline a small dog exactly as you would a larger dog - same rules, same training)|`|2O58btqxaa	yorkshire terrier|`|eiJY15Teaa	i would say a miniature pinscher.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Need more info.

How often are you prepared to walk him/her?|`|uFJXz1x3aa	Shitzu, or however u spell it lol|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Depends on your lifestyle.    Yorkies, despite public knowledge, need a good daily walk. They need daily brushing and a weekly trip to the groomer.    Malteses have the same grooming requirements as Yorkies. They are not so active, though.    The Min Pins I know are all very ill-tempered and aggressive.    Jack Russels are hyper and from what I've heard they can be real pains.    If you're planning on spaying or neutering your new puppy, why not try adopting? Shelter dogs are generally up to date with shots and have already been spayed/neutered (but some shelters jump the gun and fix before six months which is too early, so be careful).    Check out the links below.|`|264GS7s7aa	you should get a Jack Russell Terrier http://www.allsmalldogbreeds.com/jack-ru... like that  but please be sure to consider adopting a dog, they may have some pasts and they may not be purebreds but all the adopted dogs that I have had, have been adopted muts.  http://www.petfinder.com/|`|L8bUf2pvaa	what is the size in weight you want? do you mind shedding? whats your personality and lifestyle? you need to post more info.|`|DYxb7P3Baa	if ur active and energetic - jack russell terrier or parson terrier.  if you prefer a "lapdog" - shih tzu , maltese   if you prefer cute ones - pomeranian, yorkshire terrier , silky terrier  if you want to carry it around with you a lot - chihuahua , teacup yorkshire terrier    :)|`|GTqqz7kPaa	i would deffinately recommend a Bichon Frise, none of the google pictures of them are particually great but the are really cute and friendly, and dont need many walks.|`|AA11900592	I have an American Standard Chihuahua and she is a sweetheart.

Your Lab will run, jump, and play to his/her hearts content.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You'll need to keep walks down to about 10 minutes 3 times a day so as not to stress out his growing joints.  Regular play is perfectly fine as long as their is no stair running, high jumping and no over-eating.  Play til he gets tired, but don't walk him or run him til he tires out. That is bad for his hips, elbows and growing joints and could cause early arthritis or HD.|`|FZCKqZkpaa	As a puppy...he will need probably 2 -3 , 20 minute walks a day, and when he is older he should have 1-2 20 minute walks a day :)|`|bghHMy22aa	well they say labs should get 2hours a day i have 2 black labs and they get about a hour the now since it winter were i stay and there fit and health|`|j05XnPoYaa	before my dear dog died last year . i used to take it two half an hour walks and one hour walk sometime of lead in a park .|`|fa94015ff5f0c6080fd3861b1e008e8caa	until he gets tired. keep him hidrated though..

Here's a link that talks about everything labrador --breed highlights to nutritional requirement.   http://elfurl.com/dhav0|`|672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	Labs are extremely active.     They need to be walked at least once daily (2x if possible). When I had my lab mix we took him on 2 walks every day. (about 2 to 3 miles a walk, so that's 4 to 6 miles total.)    Let them run for an hour at the puppy park    Make should also keep their mind active.    train them various techniques.    Leave it is a great mind technique. get to the point where you can place a treat on their paw and they won't take it till you say ok.    teach them to fetch. active for the mind and body    Teach them sit, stay, roll over, come, dance, high five.    any technique that requires a little thought on their part.    puppies won't be as energetic as an adult dog. Puppies tend to take a lot more naps.    as an adult you'll have to prepare for walks and lots of play time|`|Dnx0pYjBaa	a few hours a day, let him run around off the lead as well, chasing sticks or something, that burns up more energy than just walking him|`|TpOVmqpHaa	At least an hour a day of good exercise.  For pups, this time is best broken up into 3 or 4 15-20 minute sessions.    A healthy, young adult dog should get a bare minimum of 30 mins per day, but preferably 20-30 mins. twice a day. This is an active breed.....so do him proud.|`|Um8osMNuaa	My two Labs have two walks a day, for around an hour each time, plus they also like to play fetch with the ball and go swimming. Labs need lots of exercise, if left to get bored they can become chewers.  Although with a puppy you need to limit the walks, gradually increase them as he gets older, better to give them a few short walks than two long ones, their bones are growing and are not yet strong enough to handle too much exercise, too much can cause damage, although your pup should let you know when he's had enough and needs a rest, my Milly would just lay down and refuse to go any further, then it was time to carry her home!|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	My Lab is 10 months old and gets destructive if he does not get at least 2 long walks per day.They are very active,especially before the age of about 3 or so.|`|6jkusbCgaa	Simply let him keep going until he is finished.     Labs need TONS and TONS of exercise their first 3 years. This should have been a well thought out decision.

ijLD9rZpaa	Males will be MUCH more colorful than the females. Like with birds, ya know? Oh, guppies breed like ALL the time, so just leave the eggs in your tank. Should be ok. If everything works out, then you're going to be a grandma/grandpa!|`|fxH6T7vCaa	Guppies are very simple, just keep about 2 females with every 1 male. The girls and boys are easyer to tell apart from girls. first they are pretty, and they are smaller then females, and the fin under then are long and spiky. The females usually only have color on their fins, and they are bigger then the males, and the fin under then is more fan shaped. It dose'nt take long for the females to get pregant, and you can tell when she is.when she is she will have a dark spot under her belly and of course be big. It usually only takes about 4 weeks for her to have babys(fry). But the days range from 20-40 days. when she is about to give birth she will act strange and the spot will be huge and squared off. I she is under to much stress while pregnat, she my have the babys earlyer, and they will die. I usualy feed the babys crushed flakes, that workes fine. They also are born to already swim in all. they also need to stay in there tank intill they are about 3-4 weeks old, or bigger then any of your other fishes mouthes, WARNING!!! the parents will eat the babys, so you should buy a birthing net or box at a pet store or something. They can usually have from 20-60 babys!!! and somtimes more!!!!!!!!. But they are realy neet when they get there colors in which will be about 3 weeks after they are born. And your normal pet store should take then off you hands too if there are to many. Its fun and worth is, For your goldfish Idk, but good luck and i hoped i helped. P.S. why males should be kept to 2 females is because they are alwayes in mating mode. thise cand realy stress out the female and somtimes she might die.|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	you are planing to mix breed cold and tropical that's just cure man|`|EHrysQcCaa	Goldfish and guppies need moving water to breed. That is why a slow flowing stream is such a good place to find guppies. Some people can manage a water flow system with an aquarium but you need to have the water moving constantly over the bottom with gravel or sand, gravel is best because they lay eggs and prefer it.  You can not tell the difference between male and female  fish unless you are a biologist and really know what you are looking at.  Just get 5 or 6 and likely you will have at least one of each.    Gestation time is only a few weeks, the babies will be so small at first you will hardly be able to see them, separate the babies as soon as you see them because the other fish will eat them.  Rely on your filter system only and don't change the water or you will likely get rid of the eggs and or infant fish.|`|napKM2y8aa	Just to make sure u no, u cant put goldfish in the same tank as other breeds of fish because they release a toxic chemical. But if u breed guppies:  - The delivery takes a max. of 24 hrs. The time the guppy is pregnant is around 22-28 days.   - U know they have bred because the female will get bigger, and it will have a big black circle on it.   - I just have my female and male guppies in 1 tank at all times, and when i think the female is going to give birth soon, i move it to another tank, then after birth, move it back so the babies wont get eaten  - In stores, the labels normally tell which are males and which are females for guppies. U can just ask a person who works there.|`|XfP895zXaa	If you want to breed guppies get 1 male with 2-4 females and let them do their thing, put the females in separate breeding cages to give birth. males are usually more colourful and smaller then females who are mostly a dull grey or brown. you can also get colourful females.|`|FfmDWyjpaa	If you want to breed guppies, put 2 male with 1 female guppy in the tank together with no other fish. Female Guppies have smaller fins than the female. When the guppies have bred, the female will have a small black dot on her stomach. This is a sign that she has fry. Guppies give live birth and do not give birth by eggs. I can take a Female Guppy up to two weeks for her to fully deliver all the fry. The female can continue to have fry even without a male in the tank. If she does has babies, I would take out all the other fish so she is left alone. Also make sure you have a sponge filter and the temp. is about 78-85 degree Fahrenheit. As to breeding Goldish, I am not sure but I know that the Goldfish and Guppies can not be together. Goldfish like the temp. cold but Guppies like it warm. Hope this helps.
m16gf9mzaa	Cats developed as a desert species.   I'm not saying they can thrive outside in full sun in the heat of the summer, with no shelter .  But I used to live in Arizona, and it would get that hot outside there, and my cats would go out in the middle of the day.  With a supply of water and reliable shade, your cat will be alright.  Also, it would not hurt to give her canned food with extra water added to it, when it is meal time.|`|VPycXVIlaa	Cats have survived for many years without air conditioning. I'm sure she'll be fine. Just make sure she stays hydrated and has plenty of shade.|`|Vw9dvel1aa	It completely up to you. But do remember she is an animal and they do know how to survive. She'll make it outside. No worries.|`|4cQSsDaZaa	you should never shave a cat. it makes them depressed. what if someone shaved your head and took you clothes off|`|Run7dyraaa	You sound like a very responsible pet owner. I like that. I have the opposite problem at the moment. I live in USA where it is FREEZING. I have 2 indoor cats, they are fine. But I feed 8 outdoor cats who are freezing outside. I made them a little house, that is the best I can do. I feed them. But when I give them water, it is so cold, it freezes. Your kitty will be ok.

She has a thick layer of fur so she's gonna be hot.|`|tyLM7VcAaa	I think you answered your own question. If you wouldn't stay out in the heat, she shouldn't either.

I do not think it is a good idea to wet any animal - especially without their fur in front of a fan.     If you want to be sure she is safe, then yes, board her. Likely though she will be fine, cats are highly adaptable and very tolerant to all kinds of weather. If outdoors she will find places in the shade or in the dirt to keep herself comfortable.     Cats have survived for 1000s of years without the intelligence of humans to keep them cool or warm enough.|`|AA10788770	well, i wouldent call it cruel since you dont really have a choice.  have you considered buying a plug in air conditioner? im not sure where they would sell them in australia.. if at all.. but you should look into one like this http://salestores.com/sharpa02.html    there a little expensive..   but in the long run it will be great for your kittys safety and health(:  and its better then paying for boarding.. which can be up to $1000 for a weekend.
SytfXV6Haa	If your cat isn't showing any other signs of illness, and you truly believe it's a hairball then a hair-ball product would be best. There are gels/pasts out there to help yoru cat pass a hairball. All you can really do is wait at this point until the cat passes the hairball. When looking at these products look for one that contains mineral oil or petroleum jelly because it 1) will not be absorbed into your cat's system, 2)it will help lubricate. In the meantime, regular grooming (brushing/combing your cat's fur) can help to reduce the amount of hair ingested when your cat grooms itself.|`|VMY7No0eaa	HAIR BALLS  give vaseline|`|A8k9NHigaa	you can put a little bit of vaseline on her paws, and she will of course lick it off, and it will disssolve the hairball. Then change her food to one that is for hairball control. Purina and Meow Mix both make one ad it is inexoensive. It is a hairball I am sure, ny cat does that sometimes takes her a day or so to get it up.|`|Uek2TNLMaa	dont need a vet for a de-hairball paste that comes in a tube.|`|aJSUlD0Baa	Lori has some good thoughts on this. Another thing you can do is go to your pet store and get this stuff (forgot name cause I'm out right now) that is a flavored paste to treat and prevent hairballs. The cats eat it without problems and you can give it to them like a treat. My cats love this stuff and it works great they haven't had a hair ball in months.|`|OtvId52Taa	Do what everyone else to do, use Vaseline. Then change the food for hairball protection.|`|JdF6noV1aa	Try giving her some water. It might soften whatever it is up so that it can pass through the windpipe.
6irSIW7xaa	Stick with lesson's there is NO WAY after just a year you can ride any horse. I've been riding for 5 nearly 6 year's and I still would not say I am capable of riding any horse, heck there are horse's I would not even begin to think about getting on becuase I am not capable of handling them. I ride green horses, I ride horses that have issue's but if for any reason I don't feel safe on that horse, or something get's out of hand I don't chance it and I get the heck off. Some people call it being a 'chicken' I refer to it as having brains- and not having have someone scrapping those brains off the floor.     The attitude you have I'm sorry to say is what get's people hurt, with horses and in life in general. so what if you can ride a horse with a bouncy trot,  can you ride a horse that decides to pull a vertical rear, or run towards a busy road with you? You think your a good rider, have you ever been on a horse whose intention was clearly to put you on the ground, or a horse that exploded out of no where. A good rider can handle those situations or at least know when and how to get out of them. A cocky rider is going to get hurt.       you never stop learning, thinking you don't need lesson's espically after just a year of riding, is totally pointless. I think in my first year of riding I was on all pretty push button mounts. I got big headed, and got paired with a pony who was just a little bit to hard for me to ride. Got out of that situation then thinking I must be able to handle anything by my third year of riding got a horse that was dangerous and way over my head. Now this horse was a nice horse (he could jump to the moon and back but he was overall nasty) , but he had the intention to seriously hurt people. Would charge you in the paddock, do vertical rear's and buck when you rode him. Bolted with me more than once, and ever went over on someone who rode him for me.  I was 11 and so scared to do anything that if my parent's had not pushed me to I probably would have quit. Got a nice bomb proof horse that  was the type I should have gotten oh...two year's prior. NOW I can ride horses who have spice, and NOW I can ride 'hot' (but not dangerous) horses. But I still and will probably never again get on a horse known to rear (no not your little pop up's I mean a horse that's willing to throw it's self over to hurt you/make you get off it's back).     So for now stick with lesson's then in a couple year's look for a horse.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	I would say you probably dont have the tiem and resources to invest in an animal all your own. Maybe look into free leasing a horse from someone, or splitting with only one other person at the owners own barn.    Try advertising on craigslist for what you're looking for. The economy is so shitty and people are short on cash and time you'd be surprised what you can find.    I just advertised looking for private dressage lessons and i found some for about half the cost of what is available out here. Not bad at all.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	It definitely would not hurt you to just continue taking lessons. I'm sure you couldn't walk/trot/canter on ANY horse. there is a wide range of horses out there. If you really wanted to get your own horse, you could board it at the same place you ride now and take lessons on your horse! that's what i did and it really helped me learn how to communicate with my horse and figure out what his "buttons" were.     the horse market isn't that great right now so you could easily find a good horse for a good price. try to get your trainer to help you find a horse that's right for you. don't just look on the internet and decide to get it because it's pretty or it LOOKS like its well trained and sound.      I'm sure you're a good enough rider to get your own horse as long as you take lessons on it or something. It would really do you and your horse a lot of good and it would form a better bond if you knew how to communicate with him.    You could like see if your trainer would be willing to give you free lessons or a discount on boarding if you cleaned stalls at the barn or something. =D    I hope this helps! Good luck!|`|CGkgsjVbaa	Hello,   i would not buy just yet :).. i made that mistake when i was younger the best thing for you to do is try share/loan/lease a horse this is where u pay a small am out of money or maybe help with the mucking out etc too ride in return this will get you use to the responsibility you will have when when it comes to owning your own it will help you ride and con roll the horse yourself  without your riding teacher there. owning your own at a young age takes up alot of time and alot of money. i've been riding since i was a small child am now 19 and compete with my horse but i have never stopped having lessons and i never will.  you can never stop learning   Hope this helps all the best in which choose you make :) x x|`|36ff2f336a335f9f03bcb18b2fe2969daa	best to have lessons , the instructor might know of a horse for you to share , I would share ..because  TO BUY ---  1. horses  are expensive to keep unless you have your own land  2. they cost a lot to buy and kit out . blankets ..tack..ect.  3.you need insurance , wormers ..shoes ..passport ..food ect  4.have to look after them 24 /7 hours, muck out everyday summer and winter.  5. hard to find holiday cover  6.your prob still need lessons  7. can't miss a day     SHARE---  1, go only days wanted  2 cheap only pay a bit  3.free to go out other days  4 other person will do holiday cover  5 give up when you want  LESSONS--  1. go when want  ie.when raining stay home  2,know how much it is  3. do pony days or weeks .for more riding /fun  4.when flu in bed ,you can stay at home .in bed .not going up windy field to get horse in pouring rain|`|psNR7hDJaa	Well if you always have a busy schedule, just continue with lessons. And then maybe co-boarding(i call it part-boarding). And every horse is different. Lots of people claim they are better of a rider than they actually are. And you can never stop learning. If you are able to afford a horse and have time for it, go for it.|`|9AzUeF9saa	Nothing bad would come out of continuing to take lessons...  It might even improve your skill.  Also, just because you can w/t/c on a horse doesn't mean you are a perfect rider.  All riders can improve, no matter how good they are.  You could buy a horse and board at the stable you are currently taking lessons at, and ride your own horse in lessons.  That way, if anything came up you could still have help and improve with your horse.  If you aren't interested  in any specific discipline, you may want to try a little of different things.  You could try some jumping, some dressage, some cross-country, even mounted games.  if you decide to do that though do it before you buy a horse because it would not be fun if you fall in love with something only to find out your horse isn't capable of it.  Whatever you choose, be sure to have your instructor's help when choosing a horse.  It would only benefit you.  If you are looking for a lower priced horse, you may want to try horse rescues/SPCA type groups.  They have many horses that are well trained and the owner just couldn't afford to keep them.  These horses are often 500-1500 at the most.  You would also give a horse a wonderful, loving home.    Whatever you do, make the decision carefully!  Good Luck :D

ax57VyUSaa	Jack Russell is a very loose term, used to represent a number of small white terriers.     Anyways, the "official" Jack Russell is small and sturdy, and tends to be intelligent, athletic and vocal. They would do fine in an apartment, but they would need exercise and you would have to deal with their barking. Not that it's unstoppable, but it is in their breeding (they used it in working) and therefore they need extra training to keep it under control.     I hope that helped. :]|`|2O58btqxaa	i have a jackrussell girl patch i wouldn't swap her she is loyal and lovable a real sweetie yes jackrussell s are great|`|ONMBbC16aa	Jack Russels are hyper, barker a lot, and jump around.

But, you're parents should be a great source for determining the breed that will fit your lifestyle and living arrangements best.  Why don't you ask them?|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Jack Russels are a very energetic breed. From what I've heard, they can be real pains.    If you're planning on spaying or neutering your new puppy, why not try adopting? Shelter dogs are generally up to date with shots and have already been spayed/neutered (but some shelters jump the gun and fix before six months which is too young, so be careful).
AA10263279	ANY bottle that will give you a fine spray is OK to use for misting....If you mist in the cage you may get their food wet...take it out of the cage if possible...make sure you put them in a sunny window after the shower...they need to dry off fast in the winter...My birds even let me dry them with a hair dryer...|`|TQ2yjsdiaa	You should use a bottle that has never contained chemicals.The water should be luke-warm and it doesnt matter if its in the cage or out.

72GOhb9eaa	You should research the breed you want, then before you ask your parents, think of reasonable answers to any objections they may have. But make sure you have enough time and money to get a dog.|`|PM23RDycaa	Your mother has said no and she means no. Stop bothering her about it. Find some after school activities or hang our with your friends after school - thus you won't be home alone all the time as you claim. Your mother doesn't have to listen because she's the adult and the one paying the bills. It sucks but that's how life is.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Nothing we dog or say will help you convince her - we don't know her, you, the situation, if she has other issues with the idea, etc. She gave you her answer and i doubt it will change unless her job (or your classes) do first.     Parents don't say bullsh*t - if mom thinks you wouldn't be home enough, then you probably won't be home enough. As a young adult you will eventually have to get a job, which will take you out from home even more than school, and you will eventually go to college (where your dog cannot follow.)    So stop whining about it. Accept that at this point in time, you will not be getting a dog. That's what young adults and mature teens do - they don't stomp their feet or keep begging.    PS - You don't just shove a dog outside on a tie-out... you have to walk it, potty train it, teach it manners, clean up after it, and so on. In fact, for some dogs a tie-out is dangerous!|`|VCCzAyvsaa	Dog walking service to prove to her that you are responsible.|`|w9J25hq9aa	Show how good you can be.

BRiRoV1raa	I've grown up in a house full of various pets. I've had many, many guinea pigs, cats, and rabbits. From my experience, the cats don't seem to bother with the guinea pigs or rabbits. But the key is to get your cats used to the new pet. You should let the guinea pig or rabbit roam around a little bit [just keep a very close eye on it; they've been known to chew wires] and let your cats sniff it out. Just make sure you're watching your pets to make sure that nothing does happen. If you do this a couple of times when you first get your new pet your cats should warm right up to it and pretty soon they may even start playing with each other. When I let my rabbit run around the house the cats will follow him around and when he realizes he's being followed, he'll turn around and chase the cats. =)    hope this helped. =)|`|u61yKsE3aa	It depends on your cat.  My cat is used to other animals and isn't aggressive.  He even lets our parakeet crawl on him.  He wouldn't hurt any other animal.  However most cats have a strong hunting instinct and anything small and fury can be potential prey.  If you have a small cat and buy a large rabbit it might not be an issue.  Also if you get any animal but make sure it is on a secure habitat that your cat cannot penetrate that would make the issue moot.  Good Luck|`|O2VZL8Praa	keep the cat well fed and the rodents caged.  if you let the rodent out to play, securely shut the door to that room.      rodents are prey but you can manage the situation quite easily.|`|RjyNInW6aa	Probably both if they get the chance. my aunt had a rabbit that teased the cats and scared them. He was REALLY big though. He was the same size as the cats. Probably a guinea pig would be in more danger.
ZH4N6Xdtaa	house rabbits live longer and healthier lives if they are kept indoors, you can keep them in their cage its no different to hutch, provided the cage is big enough and the rabbit is allowed out to play when you are home.    Some people train their house rabbits so well that they leave them out all the time with cage open so they can go home when ever they want, just like you would do with cats or dogs.    You definatly need to litter train your house rabbit though otherwise it will get messy and smelly. You litter train a rabbit in the same way you would a cat.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Many people keep rabbits outdoors all year long in hutches. If I had a guinea pig outdoors I would bring it in to my basement or garage when the temp. is going below 20 degrees F. Check on the coldest temp. in their native land and they may be ok in colder weather.|`|uFJXz1x3aa	if its a big cage then yes,,, trust me, nothings worse than having all your pets get eaten =[|`|u61yKsE3aa	Not at all as long as the cage is large enough and the animal is well cared for.  You can always put him in an outside portable cage with supervision during the day and then bring him in when you are not watching or at night.  Either way a live pet inside is better than a dead pet outside.  Good Luck and Have Fun.|`|RjyNInW6aa	No. It is being VERY nice to the piggies. You are make sure they don't become the fox's dinner.|`|g5dzse2Zaa	First of all i would get a rabbit i have had both and i just find they are more affectionate. My rabbit is an indoor rabbit he lives in a pen in my room but generally gets the run off the house (except when im not home or at night) I trying to toilet train him at the moment so once that's done he will be the perfect house rabbit.   Its not just foxes you have to worry about its cats and large birds. If you buy a good quality hutch you should be fine but house rabbits are really good pets (in my case the perfect alternative to a dog!) You also have to be careful of extreme temperatures.    Good luck with what ever you decide!|`|xowm9t3kaa	definetly not infact its probably better|`|IKoxs8sCaa	Lots of people now have them inside... thats why they sell the huge plastic base / wire cages that can go inside.. I have my two guinea pigs inside, as I was worried about the same thing!  Speak to the pet store about also getting two guinea pigs as opposed to one, as they're used to living together and can get very lonely otherwise, sometimes making it difficult to tame them..  Hope this helps!|`|BRiRoV1raa	Not at all. I've had guinea pigs in the past-- lots and lots of guinea pigs--and i currently have a rabbit; I've never kept them outside. Just make sure the cage is big enough for the rabbit or guinea pig to have living space. They would probably be happier inside with you rather than be outside by themselves. But a little fresh air every now and then wouldn't hurt either. You can either bring them outside [as long as you have an enclosed area or you keep an eye on them; they're pretty quick] or you can let them roam in the house [just keep an eye on them because, rabbits especially, like to chew wires and whatnot]. But I would absolutely encourage keeping your pet of choice inside.     Hope this was helpful. =)|`|AA11335875	Nope! It would be a lot better for the critter. Because 1. It wouldn't be fond of getting eaten and 2. Inclement weather is not the best to keep a pet in.    Whichever animal you decide to get, it would be nicer to keep it inside with you. Just make sure you get it out of the cage regularly to give it some exercise!
bf04eda87a4053f72857e70e26cc077faa	heater, filter aerator, gravel, rocks, plants, thermometer  and a light are essential for the fish you are looking to get.    Gravel is 1 lbs per gallon.  Rocks and plants are to taste, but some are needed.  Filter and aerator should be appropriate for the size tank you are using.  Same with the wattage of the heater.  All in all, there is an investment, but its actually not that much and almost all of it will last many years.    One more thing, don't forget an appropriate stand for the aquarium.  Water weighs 10 lbs per galon (approx.)  20 gall tank has 200 lbs of water, plus the glass, plus the rocks and gravel.  So the stand has to be sturdy.  Make sure you buy the stand from the fish store that can support the weight of the tank, as opposed to saying I will use a desk or dresser I have in the house.|`|8V39PymEaa	you should have a glass tank pebbles and fake plants to put in the tank and a filter and just decorate it the way you want to|`|w5Bdj8Kvaa	You need a heater,filter,aquarium gravel,fake or live plants (your choice),air pump with an air stone, and good lighting.|`|NHs3LxlLaa	-Heater  -Filter  -Lights if you want to see the fish  -Gravel  -Food  -Plants if want healthier fish  -Decorations if you want|`|NKvUI4VAaa	yea pretty much, i used to watch my grandmother and all she had were guppies and she took real good care and they lasted a long time with just decor, food, and algae eater and there were some other objects i do not recall|`|9o86713Taa	You should get gravel , and yes you should probally get a heater.

bqZQxYUraa	Yes most snakes will accept frozen foods. Some stores try to promote frozen rats and mice because it is more humane than live foods, which could either die slow deaths or even bite your snake. Frozen mice and rats are thawed in warm water so the snake still see's the mouse's heat. The frozen mice and rats are kill quickly either with a thump on the head or placed in a CO2 chamber|`|zbnwtWsKaa	you defrost them a little then you can give that to your snake because then the snake will think he killed it, and they swallow their food whole|`|HY2i80mjaa	thaw it out and hour before, snakes are raised from a young age (or should be) to eat thawed food, domestic snakes no, no difference, a wild snake would be harder to persuade....it's also illegal in Australia to feed live food to your snake.|`|owi3TGSBaa	if you have frozen mice, you put it in hot water until it is thawed and then you take the mouse by the tail and dangle it in front of the snake, he will think it is a live mouse and strike at it very fast.  then he will squeeze it until it thinks it is dead and eat it.|`|nmzpdvkqaa	you have to thaw it out first. its just like feeding a live one but this ones dead.|`|u61yKsE3aa	Don't microwave you can end up with a mess.  Thaw in warm water.  A snake used to thawed prey will have no problems.  If your snake is not showing interest you can use feeding tongs or tweezers to wiggle and move the mouse in front of your snake to simulate live prey.  Good Luck|`|175ydQo5aa	you normally warm them in water first snakes wont eat it unless its thawed|`|RgO3Sn38aa	They learn how to open your freezer and open the Swansons TV dinners.|`|AA11922229	It's pure instinct. The snake takes over. I wouldn't serve frozen prey. Hungry snakes learn to eat dead prey. You can warm the mice room temp in the microwave to fool the snake.    If the snake is not too expensive, I think its OK to give them live prey, mice, or goldfish in a bowl.|`|bFzu835Aaa	You thaw and then slightly warm up the frozen rodent. Once it's warm, instinct usually takes over and the snake will eat based on the heat and smell. Some snakes that are not started right off on frozen prey might need a little encouragement from it's owner in the form of wiggling the thawed mouse around with some tongs to simulate movement and get the snakes attention.|`|qVRmpGlEaa	With a microwave!! ahahahahahahahahahahah!!!!|`|uXsqZLoiaa	woah. i didnt know that. haha.|`|Mdi5X3ACaa	with their mouths|`|aad521432c98a74a6b4f776669a6d308aa	I have no clue.

Since the snakes don't have anything better to eat, once unfrozen, the eat it. but of course, they give rats alive to them as well, which I consider  horrible.|`|CUFnorZyaa	Thaw it out in room temp first and then dunk it into hot water for 2 or 3 seconds.

Like "Defrost" perhaps? I know lots about Snakes, I found a snake in the grass yesterday! So Snakes can pretty much "Defrost" the foods they put in their body if they suspect it is frozen.  So There ya go. Please choose as best answer if no one else is as positive as me casuse I know this is true.
ErSbeRlzaa	Have you got a separate tank to put her in and is it cycled with no fish init? If so then yeah your better of and more fry will survive When removing her take some of the water from her current tank and slowly introduce the other tanks water just as if your introsucing a new fish. Try not to stress her out as they tend to be stressed enough when they are pregnant and may die. If your other tank has a filter with a vent big enough to suck the fry in cover it up with something. I have some fabric that resembles the net. And put some sort of ornament or something so the fry could feel safe. I use live plants and some bogwood.  Also I wouldn't suggest using a breeding net (if you were going to or ever will) as this stresses out the female and could cause them to die. Ive used one in the past and 3 outa 4 times the female died =(   Hope it helps  Ps. after she gives birth take her out as she will eat the fish becuase she will be very hungry.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yes take out the pregnant platy than when she gives birth take her out and put her in with your other fish.      17 years experience with fish|`|uPJ1f9UIaa	ya u should take them out if you want a lot of babies! If not keep them in there and let them be eaten it really doesn't mater they will have way more babies to come|`|As7Sw8VRaa	Usually, the best ratio is 2-3 females for every male. This is so that they don't gang up on a single female and stress her out to much. Platys males tend to chase the females in hopes of mating with them, even if she is already pregnant.  Anyways, there's a high chance that she is already pregnant. They can store sperm up to 6 batches of fry so when you bought her, she was probably pregnant already. The picture has a guppy but the gravid spot is in the same place. If it's dark, she's already pregnant.  They tend to give birth every month but can take longer. The most important thing to breeding platys is not to rush it. A female platy that is stressed may abort her pregnancy.  When you have determined that she is pregnant, you can take one of two steps:   You can put her in her own "breeding tank." I personally don't recommend those fry traps or nets as they can stress the pregnant fish out and cause her to abort her fry. They're perfect for putting the fry in though. Anyways, you can put the mother in another tank (doesn't have to be filtered, best if not, as the filter can suck the fry in). Put lots of plants as hiding places for the fry.  OR:   Leave the mother in the main tank and just cover the aquarium floor with plants and hiding places. In a well planted aquarium, many fry will still survive.  I personally recommend the second because I don't like causing stress on my fish no matter what but it's your call|`|yQl4fiJAaa	take out the mother fish and either put her in a breeder tank, or a separate tank. make sure you have filter and heater flow either way.    when she gives birth, immediately separate the mother from her babies. the mother will eat the babies if you don't.
NnYB9eXiaa	Some tips on keeping your hamster entertained!    The best way to keep your hamster from getting bored is to change things up in their cage once a week. Not their house, food, water - but their toys and treats.      Be aware that sugary treats and all fruits should be avoided with dwarf hamsters as they're prone to diabetes.  They can be given in moderation to Syrian (Teddy Bear, Honey Bear, Golden, Panda) hamsters - but still don't go overboard with them as it can still affect their teeth - remember, they can't brush their teeth!    Hamsters get bored very very easily. A giant box full of different toys,a bowl of chinchilla bath sand (not dust!), a maze made out of paper towel and TP tubes are all fabulous ideas. You can get a really big plastic bin at any big store like Walmart or Target for under $10. A big thick cardboard box with even more walls and doorways made of cardboard can be even better because it's free - just be sure you check it before you place the hamster in each time for any holes or signs of potential holes :)    Place your hamster in his or her "play zone" whenever you want to play with it. Hide treats in the tubes so they can be discovered. You can make homemade wooden toys out of interlocking craft sticks that look like popsicle sticks - and they're great for their teeth as well.    Hamsters love to run around in an empty bath tub as well! Put the plug in, or cover the drain with a piece of cardboard so paws don't get trapped and never leave them unattended.    With chinchilla bath sand - not the dust as they can breathe it in too easily - you'll want to place the packet of sand in the bowl.  Place the bowl either into their new play area, a larger bowl, or on top of some newspaper or toweling.  They will roll flip and dig in it so you'll want something under it to catch any mess and make cleanup easier.    An idea from Stubby McMini and her hamster (I give credit where credit is due - and this is a fabulous idea!):    "...he also has a homemade 'maze' that he adores.... I got a big cardboard box and put in 'walls' theres a room with soft bedding and treats hidden, some steps, a couple of arch doorways, toilet roll tunnels, a bish bash room.... he loves it, though he does try to climb over the side so you have to watch him carefully!"    I love her idea!  She's also very very correct about never leaving your hamster unattended no matter where it is when it's outside its cage, including when they're in their balls!    Speaking of their little roll-a-thon balls.  Make sure that you have an appropriate sized ball for your hamster!  Syrians need the larger balls, dwarfs *must* have the smaller ones or it can cause serious back problems for either one.  Color makes no difference to a hamster as they're color blind, but the clear ones will make it a lot easier on them to look through as far as getting around. Not as cute for us to watch, but easier on your hamster!    Have fun!|`|7AI58IS8aa	I gather boxes from snacks, tissue boxes, and ya. I cut them up to make tunnels and stuff for my hamster to crawl in.|`|S3eJJu7haa	I Have 6 Wonderful hamsters named  (F) FOR FEMALE  (M) FOR MALE  Cookie (F)  Oreo (F)  Angel (M)  Tiny Tim (M)  Skippy (M)  Mickey (M)  I Have a hamster play pen and i always let them play with each other run in there wheel and sniff eatchother and i always hold all of them and put them in my backyard where i can see them i just sit  there watching them if there by the fence  move them back ...  id give the hammy a sock and put hamster food in it and hang it on tp of the cage they love that ...

The general rule is at 4mo double the age  to get the adult weight.  Which would mean your dog should weigh about 12-14lb.  This is fairly accurate for normal weights (not overweight).  Doesn't work as well for large or giant however.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Most dogs continue to grow on up to two years old (most major growing is done in the first year, but weight may fluctuate a bit.) I would expect your dog to double in weight and maybe size, then maybe grow an extra few inches/pounds.|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	4 months old is NOT done growing.|`|VCCzAyvsaa	It could apply to all dogs and if there were something seriously wrong then i'm sure your vet would pick it up. It could also have to do with dominant and recessive genes. Maybe the size skipped a generation. Ask the breeder.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	The vet is nuts. No dog is full grown at 4 months. He'll be around his parents' weight when he's an adult.    If I were you, I'd go to another vet... I don't like the sound of someone who "charges under the sun" and thinks that a dog is full grown at 4 months.|`|fa94015ff5f0c6080fd3861b1e008e8caa	maybe both his parents had recesive genes of being short but dominant of bigger and your dog got the two rececive your parents had...?
jdfliL3Daa	Yeh they will.|`|cXK9sY1raa	Yep, no morals there :-)|`|7AI58IS8aa	Yes, but I really don't think that's a good idea, because it can cause behavorial problems, and agressiveness. Search it up on Google    It's called being interbred. That is bad. imagine if someone made you and your sibling mate. I'm just saying, but the outcome would not be that great.|`|RjyNInW6aa	yes. Separate the boys and girls. It can cause problems with the babies if family members breed. Plus the hamsters don't care if it is there sibling all they care about is it is the opposite sex.|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	yeah, they don't care if it was their mom, sister, aunt, whatever. They mate like crazy, separate them by gender.|`|IFvj22PDaa	yes...    Seperate the boys and the girls. :)|`|oMTsDcNBaa	Yes, they will, and that's called inbreeding. The babies won't be healthy.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Every chance they get! Don't keep boys and girls together past weaning.
5Bo1A5ROaa	There is no need to put the sick cat down. The only reason to put it to sleep would be if it was in pain or suffering. And it doesn't seem like it is so there is no need to kill it. Just try to keep the two cats separated until the lease it up. The one cat should already be vaccinated against feline herpes. This vaccination is part of regular kitten shots. As long as you keep the cat updated with boosters it should not be that big of a problem. My one cat has feline herpes and my other one does not. I got one a almost two years ago and had him vaccinated. My other guy i adopted almost a year ago and he was vaccinated a well, but he had already gotten Feline herpes from his mom when he was a very little kitten. I keep my older cat updated on boosters and he seems to be doing just fine. Plus there is a powder called viralys (sp?) that i put on the sick guys food twice a day to ssuppressany outbreaks.     Now the FIV can be harder to deal with because it is in most cases deadly for cats. However, as long as the cats are kept sseparatedthe risk of exposure is very minimal. And it may be a Major inconvenienceto be sure to keep the cats separated everyday, but its something that they will have to do. Just be sure that each owner plays with their own cat and gives it lots of excersise. As long as the rooms they are in arent extremely small, everything should be fine.     The one with the sick cat probably does care about the situation but if someone suggested i put a cat that i love to sleep because it was sick (but not in pain) i would be furious. The price of the cat or the breeding doesnt make the ct any more or less lovable to an owner. This  situation may be hard to deal with but not impossible.|`|tFCYaZvRaa	I agree with all of the asnwers posted however, if the kitty with the desease is suffering, that's the only time I would consider putting him to stleep, otherwise I'd try to make the remainder ofit's little life as loving and comfy as possible.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	You ,may differentiate between a purebred and an 'alley cat' but I do not. If the situation was reversed would you kill the expensive one?|`|AA11352641	I would not let one being "expensive" be the deciding factor. A life is a life.|`|9dlRcS7caa	Killing is and always be a big No No. Give life a chance. Caution can still prevent infection. If you love someone, you'll do everything to keep him safe, and if you care do the same for the cat.|`|jAzkja82aa	if it wont live long then let it live whats left of its life out in the GREATEST comfort available, not in a shelter, and dont cut an already short life shorter. Murdering this cat be on your concience if you advise to have it put down,|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Rehome the expensive cat if you're worried about it. Many cats live a long time with those diseases and killing an animal because its background is less of a status symbol than the expensive one and it had the misfortune to catch these diseases is unconciousable.
a2cjwMKcaa	The tank wont be fully cycled yet, but the fish you have in there are small compared to the size of the tank. That means the ammonia builds up very slowly, and the cycle may actually start before it becomes a problem. This is a good thing.    Also if you have re-used a filter, gravel or ornaments from an established tank you may have moved in enough cycle bacteria to start the cycle.    I would leave the tank alone for another week, if the water tests OK then you can add a few more fish. If you start getting low ammonia or nitrite readings, just wait untill the go away.    Ian|`|9uyQ51Uoaa	Your tank is not fully cycled yet- the volume of water is large and you have few fish- it takes awhile fo all the bacteria to grow but if your readings are 0 this is good. Please dont add any other fish yet, and continue to monitor the readings- if they continue at 0 you can add fish a few at a time. Im surprised you havent seen a spike in levels so you must be doing something right. Err on the side of caution and remember to add fish slowly to allow the filters bacteria to grow as the bioload grows. Sounds like everything is going great- good luck and have fun!|`|vAwzvNgzaa	no.|`|PqT6pQAoaa	The bigger the tank, the longer it will take. 100 gallons is a lot so its going to take some time. My 10 gallon took about 4 weeks to cycle without adding something from an established tank. Do you have access to filter media and gravel from an established tank? This will make the process much faster.|`|OsVswissaa	seachem stability is not letting your tank work out it's own cycle.  for the fastest cycle you need to "seed" the filter media with nitrifying bacteria.  do you know anyone with an established tank that you can get some filter media from?  in the future consider fishless cycling.|`|FfmDWyjpaa	With what I see in the information given, your tank is not fully cycled but it is ready for some fish. A normal 100 gallon takes 4-6 months to fully settle. But now you can add fish if you like.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	everyone is right , your good to go...    ammonia won't build up in a tank that big very easliy.    if you do have any bio-media from the old filter get it in the new it will seed it if its not to late which it probably is.    just keep an eye on things , underfeed a little and let the stability do its thing.      good luck
XK9RLaPeaa	They dress in scrubs usually with animals on them. They use a stethoscope, forcepts, really anything a Doctor uses a DVM uses. Good Luck!|`|VPycXVIlaa	They use the same tools a regular doctor uses for the most part. Stethoscope and lab coat.. Maybe if you had a dog or cat on your lab coat it would help set you apart from a regular doctor.|`|mwgB5NtUaa	bring a stuffed animal|`|135587141c574a1880bd4e34dcbdb34caa	Some tools that are unique to a vet are the collars they put on dogs and cats to keep them from chewing  - they're called Elizabethan collars, and they kind of look like a big cone with an opening big enough for their neck.  You could probably make one out of poster board - they usually have black rubber on both edges to protect the animal's neck.    This link has a picture of a dog with a collar on.  http://www.petplace.com/dogs/elizabethan...    How about a regular collar and leash in your pocket?

Serve your bird these foods when they are freshly cooked, not after they have been cooked, refrigerated and reheated.    The things you want to stay away from are: avocodo, chocolate, ice cream, cake, cookies and high fat seeds.|`|p8UAIAisaa	I have 4 cockatiels and 3 of them love cooked spagetti or egg noodles.

Males can and will try to mate until they can't stand up any more. Even then they will still try.   Females can still reproduce as long as they still go into a heat.  With females it is very dangerous for them to have a litter after the age of 7 years old.  Too much on their system!
u61yKsE3aa	glass does filter uv rays so you will need to remove it.  UVA is not what is important it is the UVB.  I am doubting the bulbs that came with the tank have uvb .  Plus if they do but are used how old are they.  A bulb will still give of light but have all the UVB dust in the bulb used.  Most uvb bulbs are bad between 4 and 6 months even if they still give off light.|`|SR5zlAl8aa	yeah i think so  but i'm not sure so ask the person who u are buying the turtle from|`|nZBVbVbkaa	It might be safer to take the glass out yes. With the lights though, i would check to see if they have a uva source. Most fish tank lights are just your normal lights, withought the uva/uvb. But if its the heat you are after, as long as it has enough warmth then it should be fine
339NqJ84aa	I have 6 cats, while some will look at me when I say their name, only 1 of them will come to me (about 95% of the time)when I call out his name.."Sunny"     And I have tried hard to keep cat paws off my counter, I have found that quietly but quickly squirting them with a water bottle while saying "no" gets them moving off the counters. While I am home or in the kitchen they dare not go on to the counter..but cats are sneaky and I can open my bedroom door in the morning, and hear a "plop" as they hurry to jump from the counters.    If I call out "Kitty-Kitty" and head towards the pantry (where their food is) they will all come a'runnin!|`|VPycXVIlaa	I don't think they necessisarily remember their name specifically but the way you say it.    You shouldn't reprimand a cat to get off the counters by using it's name though. You should have a 'bad' noise... a noise that you make whenever the cat is doing something you don't want it to be doing. Use that noise whenever they are doing something bad. After enough time they will associate that noise with 'bad' and get off the counter when you make the noise.|`|aJSUlD0Baa	Just like with dogs cats can and will remeber their names. Some though are late bloomers and take a little longer to get it. The best way to teach them is to pick one then start useing his or her name often. Say you pick one off the counter use their name and look them in the eyes when you do. When you call them to come to you say here Sally Sally (or whatever their name is) then when the come pet them and say Good Sally. I had to do this with my cat Tigger who was a late bloomer.|`|BI5yivKsaa	In my experience, it's not what you say; it's how you say it. Try saying their name in a certain tone a bunch of times and then suddenly change it. See what happens.|`|9dlRcS7caa	Yes, they do remember their name. I have little kittens that still depends on their mother. They respond to the names I've given them. Just repeat the name while having eye contact with the cat.
AA10400143	It varies from state to state. Some states are by age and others just state if they are able to eat on their own. I keep mine until 8 weeks regardless of law for peace of mind.

Before then is WAY too early.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	I don't know what the laws say, but generally you should not separate pups from their mom until they're 8 weeks old.|`|AA11351227	I don't think its right for you to sell puppies!   You shouldn't be selling them. Give them away free. Mainly since your not a breeder|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Here is the link for states that have puppy laws regarding the age.    http://www.animallaw.info/articles/ovusp...    There is no law for either of these states so legally they can be sold at any age.|`|3qckOFWIaa	Puppies are usually weaned at six to seven weeks, but are still learning important skills as their mother gradually leaves them for longer periods of time. Ideally, puppies should stay with their littermates (or other "role-model" dogs) for at least 12 weeks.

As long as the cat is acting fine, you don't need to run to the vet just yet.|`|Nr7SxV5saa	No.  They would be very red, crusty, swollen, and could be oozing puss if they were.  You can put a dab of neosporin on the area to guard against it but your cat may lick it off.  The saliva has antibacterial properties as well!

mfXDUkRYaa	Well, homeless dogs are the main reason - they directly cause the millions of dogs that need to be put down due to there being no space for them.    But your point has shown a real issue. I always get thumbs down for saying this, but I will repeat it as it is a scientific fact. Show breeders reduce gene pools, only going for looks so health suffers. People who randomly breed have a higher chance of producing healthy pups because of that. It doesn't make it acceptable though.|`|PM23RDycaa	A reputable breeder wouldn't keep them in squalid conditions. Personally I don't take references from vets. I take references from the Breed club and other reputable breeders who may not have pups avail but know someone who does.    The first was obviously not a reputable breeder. As to the dogs you did have the one that died at 18 months - did you have a health guarantee? A reputable breeder will give at the least a 2 year health gaurantee. As for the dog who lived to be three - was it an inherited heart problem? If not how is that the fault of the breeder?    A reputable breeder produces more health pups than sick ones. They do a rash of genetic testing to make sure each and every dog lives up to its potential and projected lifespan. With the exception of my first dog who was mutt we adopted off the streets all my dogs were from reputable breeders.     There are reputable hobby breeders (small number of dogs) and then there are the hobby breeders who are BYBs that's who our problem is with.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	There is a difference between a hobby breeder (small time breeder) who are reputable breeders and BYB (small time irresponsible) and Puppy mill breeders who are not.    Hobby breeders do everything by the book so to speak, health test, they rarely have litters, the dogs are in good condition and are overall good dogs. They breed to better the breed, and do not make any money it surely the joy of rearing life.     BYB and puppy mill breeders do not follow breeding protocols, they do not breed to better the breed. they breed for their selfish greedy needs. Their dogs are horrible and just down right disgusting.     I dont hate hobby breeders because i am one. i am a small time responsible breeder not a BYB.    There are a few bad eggs that are ruining our reputation. They are the ones that get the medias spotlight for doing horrible things not the good breeders that have no problems what so ever.|`|2O58btqxaa	i bought  my dog from a hobby breeder and would do again she is the happiest healthiest dog ive ever had far better then coming from a breeder who as u say move them to clean kennels to be viewed|`|Fu7OK54kaa	Hobby breeders seem to be breeding just for that, temperament and maybe produce a show-quality pup during. This is why they have less problems, they're not bred for having a short snout and getting breathing problems, or having big eyes and little skull so they don't get eye problems.    Rep breeders breed for showing, and highlighting the standards, and sometimes, for money.    Hobby breeders aren't for money, for the pleasure of puppies and raising them. Not for profit.    Like your experience shows, you need to see the breeder, pups and their parents in person before buying. Check out how the owners react and check for visible health problems of each pup. Also, look at the parents and interact with them so you can see the temperament you're getting.|`|bMYv0fBHaa	Most reputable breeders are hobby breeders. This is not their full time job (even if they have a dog-related job), they do it because they love the breed and want to improve it. Reputable breeders will health test, health test, health test, have registered up-to-standard dogs, and will have dogs with championships and pedigrees to prove all of this.    The first breeder sounds like either a puppy mill or a backyard breeder, and the second doesn't sound much better. Neither one is a reputable breeder--so don't stomp on them.    Reputable  breeders are good to their dogs so that they are excellent pups/dogs for people to have. They also actually care about the well-being of these pups, so they may be a bit more picky with their homing. And they are "hobby" breeders because breeding RIGHT costs a LOT of money, and they are lucky to break even.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	What people are getting fired up about is the fact that there are so many hobby breeders who don't know what they're doing. If every breeder were responsible and knew what he or she was going to do with the puppies, this would not be an issue.    I know this woman who has two Cockers, both from reputable AKC breeders, Champion bloodlines. One has a constant ear problem, the other has skin issues. And they're from two different breeders. Her first Cocker, whom she bought at a pet store, lived 14 years without any problem! Needless to say, she's not impressed.    Besides, AKC is ruining some of the breeds, and are also not doing much about breeding out diseases.|`|AA10400143	I Guess since there are far to many ppl out there who don't care about the dogs, just the money they bring. I am a small  time breeder myself. I don't breed my dogs every heat, and they are well cared , have all their vet care & i love my dogs and their babies! I even cry when my puppies leave. I feel if you love the dogs and their breed, make sure they have good blood lines and take good care of you dogs, there is nothing wrong with it.|`|ax57VyUSaa	People aren't exactly against hobby breeders, they're against irresponsible hobby breeders, aka backyard breeders. Backyard breeders are people who breed just for the money and/or because they don't want to get their dog spayed. They don't get their dogs the proper vet care throughout the pregnancy and they usually don't have pedigrees. They usually don't consider genetics or possible genetic problems (like breeding white Dobermans). Also, they often don't do background checks and sell first come-first serve to whomever has the money.     Anyways, I hoped that helped.|`|7vJNHaskaa	A lot of people have gotten a dog from hobby breeders don't know what they are doing and are just selling for money, not caring whether the animal is healthy or not. Therefore the hobby breeders that do take care of their dogs get a bad rep from the ones who don't.|`|AA10356572	the difference is that the Reputable Breeder would honor a lifetime health guarantee if you have problems   however the "hobby" breeder wont care and wont stop breeding those dogs together  just becuase you had a problem    thats the main reason why its important to the BUYER to pick a reputable breeder...  chances for problems are everywhere - but what happens after is bound by contract with the reputable breeder    if the pups were in a messy kennel -and moved so you can see them - why are you saying it was a good breeder?|`|ZGfDjR6paa	I breed rats and gambian pouched rats, we keep our animals in clean conditions in large cages that contain at most 5 rats per 4ft by 4ft cage, these are our pets so we treat them like anyone else who loved their pets would. we love them play with them and only breed one mother one at a time and don't breed again until all of the babies have been sold to good homes. There is nothing wrong with hobby breeding as long as the breeder takes complete responsibility for the animals welfare e.g. we spent 400 on trying to save 2 rats, one of them survived the other passed away after 3 weeks of 24hr care, hand feeding and medical treatment.   This isn't me saying that you should go out now and breed your animals you MUST know everything about the animal and have enough money to pay for any unexpected vet bills.|`|66c8d4fa57df4db5b69f622f0f644b9caa	I don't have anything against hobby breeders as long as they are breeding for the right reasons.  What I am against is people who get a pedigree dog and think that they should breed it. Hobby breeders are normally experienced and know what they are doing and doing the right thing for the breed.
Vpf8q7xkaa	All of my paps think everyone is made to just love them.  They have never met a stranger in their life.  One of the things that draws me to this breed is how happy and loving they are towards anyone and everyone they meet.|`|TpOVmqpHaa	Most of the paps I know are quite friendly.  But yours is still a pup, and it's not unreasonable to expect that as he grows up, some of this over-friendliness will subside.  Right now he doesn't have a care in the world, but as he matures he may start to have some natural suspicion and be more selective / reserved with new people.  Either way, you have a great little dog, and I'm betting you weren't planning on making him a guard dog anyway, so enjoy!|`|seU9VwIJaa	My papillon thinks everyone it sees was created just for him to say hello to! He just loves meeting people on walks, at the door, at the groomers, vet's, dog park...he just loves people! According to the akc standards, papillons shouldn't be shy. They should be very friendly. I also have a japanese chin and they are supposed to be very timid around strangers, but I guess growing up with 3 other very social dogs changed that in him!|`|0UxjzoUxaa	its a puppy its in love with anything that moves...and gives it attention....|`|J1HsG21Gaa	Every pap I've worked with are very loving with other people I love working with them.
cUx1uCBkaa	mmhmm  it will get bigger either way but the question is do you want it to be happy    if yes put it in a bigge tank|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Probably. At least, they will probably grow faster.    I've seen a lot of fish have growth spurts after I moved them to a new tank.|`|MJW7Etk3aa	err yes|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	yes|`|Na2Wz5ipaa	YOU TELL ME. . ..

tT256JQRaa	dont you have to be 16?  i lied and got mine at 15 :P    i've got spider bites (and they so do not make you talk funny at all)  i say go for it!  it doesnt hurt, they numb and freeze your lip, just dont forget to clean it, and dont take it out for atleast 4 months (sounds like a long time, but its not), or it starts to heal over really quick and its really difficult and stings to get the jewellery back in    when/if you get bored of them you can always take them out, and they'll heal up pretty quick so holes in you when you are about 40 isnt a problem.    maybe just get one at first though, you have to wash it and washing 2 properly is kind of a hassle, and if they get infected (doesnt happen a lot) then its gonna be really bad. and you wont be able to eat on the first day haha.    so you should only go for one, then maybe after a couple weeks go get the second one, but sure i say what the heck :)|`|EJOqYvMZaa	if you need to ask then you properly don't really want it doing|`|nI8G21y8aa	YES!

I wanted to dye my hair SO bad when I was your age, and I waited cause my parents said I had to, and I like the colour I have right now.     But if you're DEAD SET on it, sure.   :)|`|Ap2wNS36aa	be careful some snakes are bad get something like a corn snake|`|rZVKjTV2aa	Ew. I hate them but if you think so. Ew how would you get off with anyone?|`|nmzpdvkqaa	i personally think their stupid, but if you want holes in your face go head, thats not my problem. why is this in reptiles?|`|c61c81042d80fff5afc27bed499a5b50aa	yes because you only live once|`|7Fv0Z3RZaa	NO   You will regret it later  I personly think they look awful and they make people look as if they are attention seeking and it makes them speak funny   but its your choice|`|TyFBrelcaa	I'm 14 I want them but I ain't allowed if your allowed then I think you should go for it but be sure before you get it done good luck
napKM2y8aa	You can't really put a betta with another fish because they fight A LOT, and would probably end up killing the other fish. You also can't put goldfish with other fish because they have a chemical that is toxic to all other breeds of fish. I would suggest you get two guppies, or a 3 neon tetras. You could also check out mollys or platys and see if you like those. But just to warn you, guppies breed Fast.|`|hFyodb4Daa	-betta  -3 male guppies  -2 platies  or  -dwarf gourami  any of those should work nicely|`|PqT6pQAoaa	One male betta and 3 cory cats would be a good combo for your tank.|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	a guppy male or female and a betta or a platy or a white cloud

ZH4N6Xdtaa	prawn crackers are extremely fattening, unatural and greasy I would imagine they are bad for any animal.    Try mini shredded wheat as it is totally natural, my chinchillas love them!|`|BZScNa5Gaa	yeah, my friend and I made some and we tried feeding one to her hamster Iggy after absorbing the oil with a paper towel. He was fine. Just don't feed him too much and make sure you get most of the grease or oil out otherwise he may feel sick.
vS1Z0inOaa	Actually, that should be on for 14 to 16 hours. Unless you plan to hibernate your RES (and since it's already the middle of winter now and you just got him two days ago, that's not really a great idea!) his UVB lamp should be on as long as the sun is out in the peak of summer. Depending on your area, tha's 14 to 16 hours. That's the best for keeping him the most awake and active through winter. Turn both lights off during the night so he can sleep. Unless your room gets below 70 degrees or so, he does not need a heat source at all through the night.     Enjoy your new turtle! :) They're my favorite animals and I have had many babies over the years, so feel free to ask me anything.|`|16XpYCBmaa	You should turn off his lights at night so he can sleep. Then keep them on all day.|`|BI8c6XXPaa	Leave it on for 10 hours per day then snap it off at night. They have sleep schedules the same as we do. Here are some care sheets:      http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/ca...  http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/turtl...  http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/re...  http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/reptilest...|`|rglJI1q3aa	both.    they need to sleep right? :D|`|ado8DHr7aa	I have a UVB light that stays on the whole time I am. Then I turn it if when I got to bed (14-16 hours) Then I have a basking lamp that heats the cage during the day. At night I change the basking light to a purple bulb that heats the cage a few degrees cooler, to stimulate the lighting outside. The purple is nice at night also because its darker for me, because the tank is in my room.
ZH4N6Xdtaa	I would say you need to take the doors off and you chicken wire over the front so they can see out of the cage, you will also need to make some sort of access for you to be able to clean.    You will also need to add shelves and things you could hang toys and hammocks on.       Also put some of tray which can slide under a layer of chicken wire on the bottom so the litter is seperated from the chins.      We had to buy a second cage make a hole in it and attach it to the original cage so they had more room as they quickily outgrew it, we also have a blockade for the door between the 2 cages to seperate Carl and Lenny as they occasionally fall out, especially now they are getting older|`|rQlzfHqraa	Take some of the cross members out, add some floors, make a door for each floor completely covered with wire cloth on the inside as they like to chew. Cover the whole interior with the wire and put a ramp between the floors and close the ramps if you want to separate the floors for different Chinchillas.|`|FDW159pEaa	i know this web is for rats but it still works i mean it just tell you the smae thing just ignor the rat detailes sorry  http://www.dapper.com.au/cagebuild.htm

Good Luck.|`|93622fbfae66fba95ffcc6f8a456aaefaa	It depends on the breed. Certain breeds of dogs are more difficult to train than others.

Isso se deve porque os gatos tm um senso de equilbrio bastante apurado e lhes permite fazer movimentos rpidos e girar o corpo para cair sobre as quatro patas.   O bichano realiza esse malabarismo contando com a grande sensibilidade dos receptores (estrutura interna do ouvido responsvel pelo equilbrio).  Isso tudo  permitido, atravs da fisiologia (o prprio sistema) do gato.  Sempre que o gato est em uma posi??o desconfortvel, ocorre um aumento de press?o na regi?o, funcionando como alerta para o gato, assim, essa mensagem de alerta  enviada para o sistema nervoso do gato que manda vrios sinais eltricos para o aparelho locomotor, em especial, os msculos.

O bichano realiza esse malabarismo contando com a grande sensibilidade dos receptores (estrutura interna do ouvido responsvel pelo equilbrio).

Homens e gatos possuem a mesma regi?o do crebro responsvel pelas emo??es.  ? O crebro do gato  mais similar ao do homem do que ao do c?o.  ? O gato possui mais ossos do que os humanos. Enquanto o homem possui 206, os gatos possuem 245 ossos.  ? Os gatos possuem 30 vrtebras, 5 a mais que os humanos. ? Gatos possuem 32 msculos que controlam suas orelha. Ele pode girar suas orelhas, independentemente, a quase 180 graus, e 10 vezes mais rpido do que o melhor c?o de guarda.  ? A audi??o dos gatos  muito mais sensvel do que a dos homens e c?es. Seus ouvidos afunilados, canalizam e amplificam os sons como um megafone.  ? Os gatos ouvem at 65 khz (kilohertz), enquanto que os homens ouvem at 20 khz.  ? Em propor??o ao corpo, os gatos s?o os mamferos que possuem os maiores olhos.  ?Um gato enxerga 6 vezes melhor do que um humano  noite, porque necessita de 1/6 da quantidade de luz necessria ao homem para enxergar.  ? Recentes estudos revelaram que os gatos podem ver o amarelo, azul e o verde. Ainda n?o se sabe ao certo, se conseguem ver o vermelho, provavelmente essa cor  vista como cinza ou preto.  ? O campo de vis?o de um gato  de 185 graus.  . Os gatos sacrificaram os detalhes e as cores pela capacidade de enxergar com pouqussima luz. Eles n?o conseguem enxergar pequenos detalhes, vem o mundo desfocado.  . Por serem muito sensveis  luz, os olhos dos gatos possuem pupilas verticais. Quando totalmente abertas, ocupam uma rea proporcionalmente maior do que a pupila do homem.  . No fundo do olho, os gatos tem uma camada de clulas denominadas "tapetum lucidum". A luz, aps absor??o,  refletida por essas clulas de volta para a retina, para que seus receptores tenham uma segunda chance de capt-la. Isso aumenta a eficincia dos receptores da retina em cerca de 40%.  ? Gatos de olhos azuis e brancos de pelagem, s?o geralmente surdos. ? Leva cerca de 2 semanas para o filhote ouvir bem e seus olhos abrem em mdia com 7 dias.  ? O gato possui aproximadamente 60 a 80 milh?es de clulas olfatrias. O homem possui entre 5 a 20 milh?es.  ? Os gatos possuem um rg?o olfatrio especial no cu da boca, chamado: rg?o de Jacobson.  um analisador de odores e  por isso que as vezes vemos os gatos abrir a boca estranhamente (riso sard?nico), quando sente odores fortes.  ? O gato possui um total de 24 bigodes, agrupados de 4 em 4. Seus bigodes s?o usados para medir distancias.  ? Gatos tm 30 dentes, enquanto os c?es possuem 42. Os dentes de leite s?o substitudos pelos permanentes, por volta dos 7 meses de idade.  ? Os gatos andam na ponta dos dedos.  . As patas do gato possuem receptores muito sensveis que levam informa??es, na velocidade da corrente eltrica, at o crebro: exploram coisas novas, sentem os alimentos, a velocidade do que passa sobre elas.  ? O gato domstico pode correr a uma velocidade de 50 km/h  ? Quase 10% dos ossos dos gatos se encontra na cauda, e esta  responsvel pela manuten??o do seu equilbrio.  ? O gato domstico  a nica espcie que consegue manter a sua cauda ereta enquanto anda. A cauda tambm  demonstrativa do estado de humor do gato.  ? Quando o gato est assustado, seu plo se eri?a por todo o corpo. Quando ele vai atacar, o plo se eri?a somente numa estreita faixa sobre a coluna vertebral.  . Gatos esfregam o rosto em objetos e pessoas para marcar com o seu cheiro, como uma assinatura. O odor  deixado por glandulas, que possuem na parte anterior do rosto.  . Fmeas esfregam o corpo em machos que querem e tambm, de uma forma geral, todos se esfregam naqueles que sabem serem maiores e mais fortes, mas n?o quer dizer que o considerem superiores.  uma deferncia e um pedido de amizade.  ? O Maicis, o primitivo ancestral dos gatos, era uma pequena criatura que vivia em rvores h 45/50 milh?es de anos.  ? O Maine Coon  a nica ra?a natural de gatos da Amrica. ? Existem cerca de 100 ra?as de gatos.  ? Gatos respondem mais facilmente a nomes terminados com som "i".  ? O gato treme quando sente muita dor.  ? O ronronar nem sempre  por alegria e prazer. Alguns gatos ronronam alto quando est?o muito assustados ou com dor.  . Gatos selvagens miam muito menos do que os domsticos. Isso se deve ao fato dos gatos aprenderem que miando chamam a aten??o do homem para suas necessidades.  ? Os gatos s?o muito limpos e passam cerca de 30% de sua vida se limpando.  ? Quando se lavam, os gatos perdem quase tanto lquido quanto perdem na urina.  ? Gatos adultos e sadios passam 15% de sua vida em sono profundo. Em sono leve por 50% de sua vida, o que deixa apenas 35% do tempo no estado acordado. Mas passam do estado de sono profunda para acordado e alerta, mais rpido do que qualquer espcie.  ? Um gato  capaz de pular 5 vezes a sua altura.  . O gato sempre cai de p, desde que o tempo de queda seja suficiente, para que ele gire seu corpo e se defenda da queda, amortecendo o impacto.  ? A expectativa de vida de um gato de rua (sem dono)  de cerca de 3 anos. Um gato com dono e dentro de casa, pode chegar a 16 anos. Uma fmea chamada "Ma", viveu por 34 anos, sendo o gato que viveu mais tempo, que se tenha registro, at hoje.  . Para calcular a idade do seu gato, considere que o primeiro ano de vida equivale  15 anos humanos. Adicione quatro anos a cada ano a mais de vida que ele tiver.  ? Napole?o Bonaparte, Dwight Eisenhower e Hitler, detestavam gatos.  ?Winston Churchill, Abraham Lincon, Florence Nightngale, Robert E. Lee, Sir Isaac Newton, Mark Twain, compositores como Ravel e Chopin, Buddha, Mohammed, Jules Verne, Ernest Hemingway, Henry David Thoreau, Monet, Renoir.

AxENuJahaa	If your tank is done with the cycle, start putting in your fish 1 or 2 at a time with several days in between.  That way you won't trigger another cycle.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	if you want to put tropical fish in it. Then I would get a couple of gold fish at first. For one goldfish can live in about anything. Second, tropical fish live off of a certain type of bacteria. That bacteria is in the goldfish poo. So I would start off with 2 of those 28 cent gold fish that you can get at walmart and see how that goes. So if they die your not out a lot of money. Just the amount that you can probably find burried in the couch.. If you do want tropical fish you need to leave the goldfish in the tank for about a month at the most. When you clean the tank dont drain all the water and dont clean the rocks. I always used on of those syphin hoses. But you want to keep at least 4 inches of water in the tank. So when you get tropical fish then all the bacteria isnt gone when they are put in the tank. You can also get anti shock drops to help out the fish. I never had to use them but they are ok to use when you have new fish.. Good Luck!!|`|AA11901352	Since your tank is new, you should only add 10-12 % of the volume of your tank in inches of fish once per week.  Odd tank at 35 gallons here, you should only add about 4 inches of fish at one time.  Either 1 4 inch fish or 3 4 inch fish.  You need to allow for a weeks time between additions.  this allows your biofilter to produce increased beneficial bactera to  compensate for the new waste load.  this goes for plants as well.|`|qcOwLNQEaa	how tall is it?....|`|d2w6UMeyaa	One of the advantages to a fishless cycle is that you can fully stock your tank once cycled.  However, how many fish you can add depends on what fish you want to keep.|`|p9ebJtnjaa	You need to balance the newness of the filter against the needs of the fish.  If you want shoaling fish, buy them in groups of no more than 8, then wait for a month or so before getting the next lot (although, that said, you shoal quarantine additional stock once the first fish go in).    Territorial fish are fine to add in ones or twos.

Tenho uma cadela dalmata, muito braba, ela tem 1 ano e 6 meses, apareceu uma gatinha com menos de 1 ms de vida, nem sabia comer, cuidei dela.  Sempre que meu marido estava em casa, ele segurava a Paloma, enquanto eu colocava a gatinha nas em cima do focinho dela, sempre passando a m?o carinhosamente sobre as duas.    Eu sempre fazia isso, colocava a gatinha perto do focinho da Paloma, pr ela se acostumar com o cheiro da gatinha, aos poucos fui deixando elas duas juntas, mas sempre de olho.

3GjClBZAaa	La race Golden a la rputation d'aimer l'eau (comme le labrador) mais il y a des individus qui chappent  la rgle (il ne faut pas en faire une gnralit et ce n'est pas une tare)  Si tu dis que ta chienne a subi des mauvais traitements c'est normal qu'elle ait peur, puet-tre que certaines situations lui rapellent de mauvais souvenirs. Et puis un chien qui a t maltrait est plus sur ses gardes (c'est normal qu'elle est peur, par exemple, des bruits soudains et violents genre ptards)  Je pense que tu dois tout faire pour qu'elle se sente bien avec toi et qu'elle raprenne  se sentir en scurit (pas de gestes brusques,...)  Si tu veux l'habituer  l'eau, vas-y progressivement.  Si tu es inquites, tu peux consulter un vtrinaire comportementaliste (c'est le but de mes tudes et il te conseillera mieux que moi)  Pour qu'elle cesse d'avoir peur, Amour, tendresse et patience  Voil, et bonne chance|`|xrgEr0Obaa	Beaucoup de patience et d'amour. Je pense que l'apprentissage du bruit ou de l'eau par le jeu doit pouvoir se faire ; Le golden est un chien trs sociable est joueur, essaies de dtourner son attention de ce qui fait peur en le faisant  jouer avec. Une balle qui tombe dans une bassine d'eau , puis dans une plus grande ... etc; Je pense que l'envie de jouer sera la plus forte. Mais avant tout patience . Commence par exemple sans la bassine, et puis un jour, mince, elle est tombe dans l'eau. Bon courage. Un gros calin  ton chien.|`|105a41feb47d8ce5f795083d8f963cdaaa	beaucoup d'amour et de la patience de plus tu devras arriver  gagner sa confiance et surtout ne l'obliger  rien car ?a ne fait que renforcer sa peur, essaye par le jeux si elle joue bien sur on arrive  de trs bon rsultat, et laisse la s'affirmer aussi sans te laisser dborder bien sur, le golden est un super chien elle comprendra il faut juste qu'elle comprenne que ton environnement n'est pas dangereux et n'est plus source de maltraitance, bon courage|`|D7OFstJzaa	Notre premier Golden tait un trouillard au niveau de l'eau, et en plus en raison de croisements consanguins dans sa ligne il ptait parfois un cable et devenait super dangereux; est-ce que ces croisements l'origine de sa peur de l'eau? je ne sais pas...    Notre deuxime est une femelle adorable, qui avait peur de l'eau au dbut, mais maintenant ?a va nickel, sauf quand il y a de grosses vagues, mais ?a c'est normal.    En revanche, le coup des ptards, ?a me para?t normal, notre chienne en a peur aussi et est terrorise  chaque orage.|`|pBrWehZFaa	du calme de la douceur et beaucoup d'amour  il y a des blessures qui ne referment jamais mais on peut essayer de les attnuer|`|fEIhbIHTaa	Mes parents ont  peu pres le mme problme avec leur chien. Seul le temps et l'amour peut rsoudre ce problme. Tu peux essayer de l'habituer au bruit. par exemple en restant a cot d'elle et demander de faire un peu de bruit. Tu devras alors la rassurer. Evite cependant de lui donner une friandise car au moindre bruit elle viendra qumander sa friandise.     Il faut essayer d'associer le bruit  qqch de normal. Mais il faut du temps...    Bon courage  toi

9xCJGTKBaa	Yes. Something you do to one of your pets could annoy him, but it won't have the same effect on another.    This happens all the time with my cats.|`|c5ec0014eaccadd1063404da7009e9a4aa	i know that mine doesn't like it when you wake him up, but they have pretty easy lives.  i doubt they have anything to complain about, if they are taken care of properly.
JrnXCy49aa	You need to give her a stern NO when she chews stuff . As for the scratching ...   There are so many ways around it that declawing is totally unnecessary.  You can cover the area she shreds with double-sided tape or tinfoil.  You can use a waterspray to deter her, along with using a citrus-scented spray on the items themselves.  Get her stuff to scratch, scratching is natural for a cat. Instead of stopping it, redirect it. Play with her with string on the surfaces.   When she scratches, you can put her on the surface she's allowed to scratch and pet her to encourage her to start kneading, which then would let her know this is preferrable.  Rub catnip onto the allowed surfaces.  You can also clip her claws. Get your vet to show you how, or check http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...    As for the snarling, when she does, do what her mom would do - scruff her (if you're not sure ask your vet to show you how) - pick her up by the scruff of the neck, when it's done correctly she'll tuck all her legs up like she did when mom carried her around, and she'll submmit to you as authority figure.  Give her a room at a time extra to get used to, gradually she'll be used to the house, keep it interesting with loads of toys and things, then gradually you can let her out (not before like 5 months old or so, that young they cannot defend themselves properly. One step at a time and she'll be fine. Have her microchipped and have all her shots up to date and teach her about the outdoors with you there and she'll be safe, or better yet invest in the Purrfect fencing system, that way she cannot get outside of the designated area.|`|AA11603761	You dont let her outside, that's how cats get killed and sick.|`|AA11299986	does she have enough toys to play with maybe get some new ones, get her a new scratch post and or a cat tree so she has something to play on.  it sounds like boredome.  how much do you play with her.  get a string toy and play with her wear her out at least once a day.    it sounds like she doesn't like to be picked up so don't, some cats just don't like it.|`|wPoyAJ5aaa	Your cat is not well socialized. That means she hasn't learned to get along with other animals and humans. I think she might have had a difficult life when she was young, so it's difficult for her to trust anyone.    Some cats don't enjoy being picked up, especially if they weren't handled much when they were very little. It doesn't mean she doesn't like you. When she gets to know you better, she might enjoy being near you rather than on you. One of my favorite cats was always like that. I loved him very much and we were  very close, but he always hated being picked up, for all of the 15 years that I had him.    I'm curious about the circumstances that brought her to your home. How did she end up at the vet's? Why did the vet give her to you? I think you should contact the vet to find out a little bit more of your cat's history, and perhaps get some ideas about how best to deal with her.    In the mean time, you need to do everything you can to keep her away from electrical cords. Chewing through a live wire can easily kill a cat. She was lucky this time, but next time might not turn out so good. Speak to the vet about this do. She/he probably can recommend a product that you can put on the plugs to make them taste bad, so she won't bite them.|`|4c4e78cdfed131967c22d003a7184e1daa	Unfortuneatly, as a cat keeper, I can tell you that she should have adapted within the first 2 weeks at most. The fact that she growls at you and exhibits destructive behavior shows that she has already adapted to her new home, but just does not like her situation. Cats are often tempermental and it seems as though this cat is never going to get along with you.|`|buHhpTLuaa	Something is bothering her, when she is naughty, NEVER give her a smack as this will make a cat even more angry and aggressive, they might forgive you but they will never forget.  Use a feather on a string on a stick to play with her, cats who play alot are light hearted.  If she has been locked up for two months, it is a long time.  When you are ready to let her go outside, don't just open the door for her, generally cats that have been locked up and see you opening a door will dart outside like a maniac, what you must rather do is, while the cat is doing its own thing in the house where it cant see you, open the door to your yard and sit down on the couch like its no big deal that the door is open. When your cat sees the open door and your manner, it will progress towards the door slowly and take its time in going outside making sure that it still has one paw inside the house just in case.|`|fba34149ce78043819175ab4f4b9c143aa	My advice is based on having had many cats, none of which has had the behavior problems yours is seeming to have.  She is destructive...possibly bored.  She is likely to get electrocuted if she continues to bite the wall plug.  Many kittens growl when playing, but if she does this EVERY time you pick her up, she is either defending herself by warning you ( have you ever hurt her physically?) or she is downright aggressive.      There is no answer to how long it will take her to get used to her new home.  This varies with every kitty.  I've always made it a rule to have two cats to keep each other company, but this may not be a good idea if your cat is aggressive.    A good time to let her outside is never.  If she is microchiped, you might get her back if she runs away, but there are many dangers for cats outside.  She is also a danger to other cats, and to anyone who might pick her up and she might just bite them and you would be liable for the Dr. bills.  She also might kill birds which is why I don't let my own cats outside.   Declawing her might help if she keeps on tearing things up, but it is a very painful proceedure for a cat.      If your Vet would take her back, I'd return her and get a kitten which is far more trainable..perhaps more expensive, but mor likely to bond with you and be the affectionate cat you'd like to have.j  This is a far better solution than having continuous behavior issues from this cat.     A more experienced cat owner might be better for this cat.|`|S1C6WWrcaa	 1- you can let her go out side in the morning.   2-are these wall posters in you bedroom? if so keep her out of there durning the day.   3-Did she bite it or chew it? if she chewed it call the vet and tell them what happened and see what they say.   4-When you pick her pet her and tell her it's going to be ok and give her a little hug. Every time you pick her up do this and eventrally she'll trust you.   5- It normally takes a cat 2-6 months to get use to a new home specially if you have other pets or children, fast movement will make her skittish, do you know her back ground?.|`|OLvCKgMqaa	Are you sure its even a cat?        If it is, cuddle it into submission, then have a logn, sincere talk with it      and lick it
njUq1pNWaa	The vaccination course is usually composed of 2- 3 vaccines but will be dependant on the type used by your vet. Kittens should have their primary vaccine at around 9 weeks of age (dependant on the type of vaccine used). Current veterinary recommendation (compulsory for most catteries) requires vaccination against Feline Panleucopenia (feline infectious enteritis) and Feline Calicivirus and Feline Herpes Virus (feline infectious rhinotracheitis- Cat Flu). Optional vaccinations are Feline Leukaemia Virus (FeLV- highly recommended), Chlamydia (some veterinary practices will give this as a matter of course with the primary vaccination; recommended if you plan to show or breed your kitten) and Rabies (required if travelling abroad). Kittens are normally allowed out approximately 2 weeks after the second vaccine. Annual boosters are also required to provide continued immunity. Kittens should be healthy at the time of vaccination.  Your vet may recommend a blood test prior to giving the FeLV vaccination to check that your kitten has not already been infected by the FeLV virus. If she is already infected then vaccination is probably of no benefit. Discuss any questions you might have regarding vaccination with your vet.    Spaying around 6 months|`|LfVepz9Raa	you can take the kitten to get her first shot at 6 weeks old.    and 8 weeks before she can get spayed.    i have 5 cats.    and raised 4 litters.|`|b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	Vaccinations for new kittens are usually given in a series of three shots at 6, 8 and 12 weeks of age.  They need their rabies shot at 16 weeks... and can get spayed any time after that.|`|solnhWMEaa	vets will not give shots to any animal younger than 4-6 weeks old.  My kitten was spayed at 4 months and they will not do it until atleast 2 weeks after all the immunizations are completed.  Good luck with your new kitten!|`|d3d2ec796bb995be1394c2429f8eed10aa	Kittens can get their first set of shots when they are between 6-8 weeks old. They will need another set when they are about 12 weeks and then their adult shots when they are about 16 weeks. They will also need to be dewormed when they get their shots. They can be spayed as young as 3 months, but some vets won't perform the surgery until they are 6 months old.|`|juEwat3Uaa	you can take her for her shots after they are 12 weeks old now that just the first shots the 6 in 1 or 8 in 1 you need to do 3 times in one year and the first rabies shot is good for 1 year then the second shot is 3 years they are both the same dosage and same meds but it's her body that will developer a better anti against it now for spaying.At least 6 mos. old she will have to developed all her inner parts and at that age she will be done there are known times that her uterus will grow back when there to young to have this operation.

fc72baf16fb85cd9581091f621855ba3aa	The very idea is absurd and criminal.  Thanks for fighting against it.  Of course you have my support!!!|`|DLxh9CANaa	Is this a sanctioned hunt, sponsored by the fish and game department in that state, or is it just simply an illegal party organized by people who believe themselves to be big game hunters? Cougars ( or mountain lions, as they are known in California, where I used to live) are an endangered species which is protected by federal law, the last time I checked. Hunting them is always a federal crime- it is considered to be poaching. So unless this is a sanctioned, government sponsored program to get rid of a few problem animals, then this whole thing is illegal. Mountain lions were in that part of the world long before humans were- and we live in their territory, they don't live in ours. Maybe you should investigate further and see who's behind this hunt- if they aren't legitimate, I'd report them to the authorities.  Just my thoughts...|`|168b0545256a120599bd0115deaa4a3baa	Ya, im against that. Soon we'll kill off all our wildlife. Such beautiful animals too.

op3t8OtVaa	Okay, just one fact. If you had fleas before using the frontline, does not mean that the lifecycle is dead. You need to keep applying the frontline every month. There are multiple life stages to the flea such as eggs, larvae and the adult flea. Now you may be seeing these live fleas because the larvae have formed into adult fleas..    Don't worry though, keep up the treatment and you shouldn't need to worry about changing products. Frontline plus contains Fiprinol which makes the adult fleas incredibly hyperactive so that they literally wear themselves out.    As I've said you just need to keep up the treatment. Once the adult fleas bite on your dog they will ingest the product and begin to die.    An alternate product you can use is Capstar which will begin to kill the flea's in 30 minutes. This is safe to use every day if need be. But you will still have the problem of the other life cycles.  |`|3oJL2Go3aa	You want to wait a month before you put anything else on your poodle. I would go out and get some sergents flea and tick shampoo and bath her. There is also some flea dip stuff that I found really effective and it is by hartz.. Good Luck!!|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	That's weird.  I always used Frontline for 14 years never had a problem.      Fleas normal die with in a few minute of adding the correct amount of frontline.    Did you wash her any time after the treatment? Did you give her the right amount for her size and age?     Advantage makes Advantix that kills fleas ticks and is a mosquito repellant.   Only thing you should not use it in a house hold with cats. |`|AA11589437	Normally you put the spot on every month, but if there is an infestation it is Ok to repeat within 2 weeks. My best advice is to use Frontline Spray, not the spot on. It is permitted even for baby kittens, so I don't think there will be a problem if you use it now, and it kills the fleas instantly!|`|3GZz5iNFaa	Well...you should ask the vet how long you have to wait before you can safely use another medication.  I am sure you can give him a bath, and just a little hint fleas go unconscious for apprx 10 min.  they don't just die in water.  Hope this helps.|`|JtZfTiEEaa	Did you bathe the dog 48-72 hours before or after applying the Frontline?  Did you use regular Frontline, or Frontline plus?  Regular Frontline will only kill the adult fleas.  The Frontline plus breaks the life cycle of the flea by killing the larvae and the eggs.      If you have walked a dog trhough a flea infested area, such as a grassy area, your dog can still pick up fleas, but they have to bite the dog in order to be killed.  It's not an immediate death for the freshly biting fleas, either.  It takes around 24 hours to kill off any new fleas.    If you've applied any flea treatment, I wouldn't apply any new flea spot treatment for 30 days.    You can still use a flea shampoo.  This will kill any active fleas, but flea shampoos don't allow any lasting protection.  Once again, don't apply any new spot treatment for 48-72 hours before or after bathing.|`|2vaAzytgaa	Keep the dog trimmed well. I found that baby powder does the job, they sneeze, and when reaching for their handkerchiefs, they loose their grips and fall off the dog. More sprinklings of power, and the flees sneeze themselves to death.  |`|NSTdVLjhaa	You should ensure that you applied the Frontline correctly. Hopefully, you used the full dose, you used a dose appropriate to your poodle's size, and that you did not administer a bath in the week or two following the application of the Frontline. If you didn't apply it correctly, you should apply a new dose and the fleas should be dead within 48 hours.    If you applied it "by the book" then either your dog was exposed to a ton of fleas on your walk (not likely) or Frontline isn't as effective on your dog. Either way, you can go to your Vet and get a different brand of flea treatment any time. Check with your Vet to confirm if you can apply it right away, but if your dog has live fleas right now you will want to apply the new product as soon as possible.    You can give her a bath in flea shampoo. What that does is to kill the active fleas on her now, but it won't prevent fleas from coming back to her the way that Frontline and similar medicines do. I hear your concern about not wanting to overdose her, but clearly if she has fleas now she doesn't currently have a working dose - so don't worry about overdosing her. Good luck!

What you should do is give the dog a bath to take off all of the excess hair.  Make sure to use dog shampoo, then dry him with a towel or you can use a hair dryer if he isn't scared of it.<br>  <br>  You can put furniture covers over your furniture until the summer, when they stop shedding as much.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	It's a cyclic thing.

I take my hound outside everyday and brush him for 5 min with one of those serrated loops that they use on horses.  He loves the scratching and it snags tons of hair that just takes off with the wind.|`|uuopzkeNaa	their shedding their winter coat it's normal. brush them everyday even the cats. if you can bath them once a week then blow dry them while you brush them it will maintain their undercoat.|`|Yyv4WQLiaa	brush them daily, when i give mine a bath i also have a special bath mitt that gets even more hair, for the shedding i take a sticky roller over the couch or you could put a sheet or blanket over the couch and then when you have company remove it. plus its easier to get out when you wash and dry it. you could also take dryer sheets and rub them over the couch to help prevent the hair from sticking so much, and try to run a broom or vacuum over the area everyday. hope this helps.

Instead it is ONLY about what dogs should or can eat.<br>  <br>  For instance, did you know;<br>  That there are the ten amino acids that are essential for a dog's dietary requirements (a cat requires eleven). Note humans only require eight essential amino acids in our dietary intake, and for this reason a dog could starve if given the same protein sufficient to sustain human life. <br>  <br>  Can you name the 10 essential amino acids required by a dog?<br>  <br>  Personal experience:<br>  I have had competitive dogs now for well over 50 years. During that time I suppose I have tried every type of diet known to man. What I have found to be true or not true is quite surprising, and most of what you hear these days has absolutely no foundation in fact. <br>  Surprisingly nearly 70% of all upper level field trial dogs are on just two different brands of dog foods. Purina/Pro-Plan or IAMS/Eukanuba. There is a survey on RTF (retriever Training Forums) that proves that out.<br>  That same statistic holds true with show dogs.<br>  Uno the beagle that won Westminster last year eats plain ole Purina Dog Cow, My show dogs are all on Purina ONE. Week after week I see a grundle of show dogs that are on IAMS, and they win their fair share.<br>  The reality is that in their 10,000 year history dogs have never had it so good. The worse dog food on the market today is lightyears ahead of what dogs ate as little as 100 years ago. My great grandfather was a market hunter. What remained from cleaning the ducks after the days shoot is what was left laying on the ground for the dogs. So it was duck guts and marsh grass or nothing.<br>  <br>  Some of the myths that I laugh at every day on this site are things like "dogs can't digest grains" followed in the next sentence with "dogs are allergic to grains", now how in the world can a dog do both!|`|RPTwjyjIaa	I personally would not use Purina, Iams, Beneful or anything you would find at wal-mart as these are not very good foods.

They really like the taste, I find I feed less, their coats are shiny, and the ingredients are great. <br>  <br>  I use Cannidae for my senior dog since taste of the wild does not have a senior formula. I think this is a great dog food. He is a husky/border collie mix and for most of his life the vet has said that he was about ten pounds overweight (on an inferior food). When we switched to Cannidae he lost weight, has a shinier coat, eats better, and over all seems to do great on it. <br>  <br>  I would highly recommend either of these brands.

zuYpulgKaa	Sugar Gliders ARE NOT rodents.<br>  <br>  For the best source of current information on sugar gliders, I suggest Glider Central  www.glidercentral.net<br>  <br>  You will find sections on diet, housing, health etc.<br>  <br>  And to answer your question about the leash...NO, they are NOT a good idea for a glider.  They can either strangle the glider or if a harness type is used, it can tear their patagium (gliding membrane)  The best leash is a good bond with your glider.|`|J5hsCONRaa	If you need all sugar glider owners, Id post this in the rodent section!

dnl66ZXTaa	The sexes are fairly easy to differentiate by observing the body type. Males are much slimmer than the stocky full-bodied female. If you are trying to breed them... You will also need, a separate breeding tank that should be set up with very soft acidic water (4 dGH or less), a dark substrate, and fine leafed plants. Lighting must be very dim. If the room is very bright, place cardboard on the sides of the tank to subdue the light.<br>  <br>  Breeding pairs should be selected from healthy adults that are approximately one year old. Younger fish may spawn, but best results are achieved in fully mature fish. Condition the breeding pair prior to spawning with live foods such as brine shrimp and mosquito larvae. <br>  <br>  Spawning generally occurs early in the day. The female will scatter several hundred sticky eggs on the plants and/or substrate. Once spawning has occurred, the mating pair should be removed from the aquarium, as they will consume the eggs and young fry. Fry are relatively easy to raise, and may be fed commercially prepared fry foods, freshly hatched brine shrimp, or finely crushed flake foods. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SOxdyWQOaa	the strips are bolder on the female <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  17 years experience with fish|`|GHpcc5iKaa	Well a male once its old enough will have a long fin that grows near the back of the underside of its belly and its umm a well you know lol.

But we still took him out everytime he started sniffing around a lot, about 5-10 minutes after he ate or drank and immediately after he got up from a nap. He is doing much better as he sort of knows the schedule now and we still put the pads down when we go somewhere and for the most part he will only pee on the pads. When he does have an accident in the house we take him right outside. I wouldnt put his nose in it as he may start eating his poop (to hide the evidence) and just scold him a little and take him right outside.

c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	Unless you're planning on breeding, you should probably neuter him. It shouldn't change his personality, although I've heard that it CAN help some dogs with aggression or dominance problems. What he really needs is some training. (And even more exercise won't hurt, either.)|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Neutering is something you really should do, if you are certain you don't want him fathering any pups (by eliminating the urge to breed, it does help to "calm" him) and because it eliminates the risk of testicular cancer.  Him being naughty when left to his own devices won't necessarily change, that may require some obedience training.  It doesn't make a "naughty" dog all of a sudden "good", lol.  It's also a myth that it changes their personality (except for the above mentioned "calmness", which isn't a bad thing).|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I personally support neutering pet animals that won't be bred for health reasons and for certain behavioral situations.  However, it won't cause a change in the personality of your dog or the behavior you describe.  I still think it should be done to prevent unwanted litters, marking behavior, wandering and testicular cancer.|`|rKZdJmFhaa	Pets (dogs and cats particularly) should always be spayed or neutered for so many reasons.  Neutering male dogs has even been shown to reduce the risk of some cancers.  It is a win/win thing to do.  His personality should not change except for the better.|`|uicbw4Eeaa	ask a vet c what they say|`|RT8LZy7gaa	Part of the boisterousness may be dominance related but neutering males has definite health benefits.  The chances of him developing testicular cancer (common in intact males) goes away.  He won't be prone to aggressive or dominant behavior, less likely to get into a fight with another male over a female, etc.<br>  <br>  He's only a young pup and a lot of his behavior is due to his age and breed.  The neutering may calm him a bit as he gets older but usually it's the dominance issues you will notice going away (for example I found a 5 year old intact male cat, had him neutered and a week later he stopped spraying urine everywhere like he used to).<br>  <br>  I had my male puppy neutered when he was 4 months old and he's never developed the urge to lift his leg on everything, moving or not. That's what I was dreading with adopting a male dog.  But he's not shown any "male" behaviors and I think, gets along better with my female.<br>  <br>  I would suggest, if you don't plan to breed him, that neutering would be the best thing.
0HNjbW7gaa	You do not need an Obedience trainer, you need a Behaviorist specialist. These situations you are having are a direct result of poor structuring of your dog. I own a English Springer Spaniel notorious for "rage syndrome" though you will not find a raging bone in my dogs body. Why? Because I took the time to put my dog on an exercise regiment, plus I assert myself as the leader. Not once have I lashed out at him to get my point across and not once has he shown "rage." I work with dogs that have the same problems your dealing with. If you live in the Chicago vicinity I would be more then happy to meet with you. If you do not, feel free to email me.|`|1XLZdOcQaa	It's a sad fact that many of the behaviors that lead to so many dogs being abandoned and put down--house-soiling, chewing, barking, and the like--are completely preventable, and often treatable. All that's needed is some time and a commitment from you, the new owner, to teaching your dog good canine manners.<br>  <br>  You may want to start sending your dog to dog training classes so he can actually learn to socialize more with the other dogs, along with their owners. Here's a link that you can read about. good luck!<br>  <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/t2a.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/t2a.html</a>|`|uicbw4Eeaa	your dog is overpertive

Dogs are more social, so they want to be with you and learn commands and please you, whereas cats don't really care if you're happy or not. So in that sense, dogs are much easier to train, but that doesn't mean cats aren't smart. Dogs don't understand most of what you're saying, but they like when you talk to them in a happy voice.|`|ZTaFYgwbaa	a cat is just as Intelligent as a dog because you can teach them all the same tricks infact you can teach them to flush a toilet.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	I think it's impossible to compare "intelligence" of two different species. They have different behaviors, genes, etc. so they have different skills and abilities.<br>  <br>  That said, if you are simply determining "smartness" based on learning ability, they are equal. My cats come when called and one did tricks. They could do more on cue if I actually put in the effort to teach them.|`|MT0gw2hmaa	I think dogs are like those chatty friends that when you talk to them they nod and say hmm, and give us imput. <br>  Cats are like those friends that are great quiet listeners that sit there and nod. Both are loyal and loving friends they just react different.|`|ISPIa0n5aa	They both understand certain words after repetition and voice infliction.  But if you sit down and tell them about your day at work, they have no clue what you're talking about.|`|Q8amh0rUaa	the tone of your voice lets a dog know if you are being nice to them or telling them they did something wrong.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	I find cats more sensible,but   dogs are bright|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It's a different kind of intelligence so you can't compare.  Dogs are more social and so their intelligence is geared toward living and hunting in social groups.  Cats are more solitary and their intelligence is geared toward surviving as an individual.<br>  <br>  Dogs do understand some words taught to them by humans but they are even better at signals and body language which is more natural to them.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	Dogs understand certain phrases, but it's because you train them that way by offering praise when they do the right thing.  What they mostly hear is "blah blah blad good dog blah blah sit blah blah no bad dog blah blah"<br>  <br>  Cats do the same thing, learning by repetition. You can teach cats tricks but whether they actually do them is another thing. But they aren't inclined most days to want to please their staff.  <br>  <br>  However, both species can understand when humans are being kind, mad, need attention, are sick, etc.  They become attached to their owners in the same way we become attached to them. Dogs just wear their hearts on their collars, cats are more obtuse - sometimes! Many cats are just as affectionate as dogs. It's just that dogs are pack animals and cats are not.|`|rRO3x9hZaa	I don't think that dogs are any smarter than cats. You can train them both to do things. In most causes, it is because cats are stubborn and live by their own rules that they don't seem as Intelligent. I think they are equally Intelligent. I've seen really smart dogs and really dumb cats and I've seen equally smart cats and just as dumb dogs. I think that they do understand when you talk to them. Or they at least understand your tone of voice.|`|tCnETE4caa	I think dogs are more intelligent, but cats are more 'streetsmart'. They have to be more careful than dogs because dogs dont have anyone above them in the food chain anymore, cats do (dogs).<br>  <br>  Cats are much better hunters and can feed on their own if necessary, dogs really struggle if they are not fed. Cats have better instincts.|`|jwIdq5qkaa	I think both breeds are intelgent but since I'm a dog person I will have to go with my pups. I can talk to my pups and they act like i know every word I say. My older dog even gets defencive when my husband starts talking about kids. Older dog doesn't like children at all and when they are mentioned she sleeps between us so we can;t get together. lol. If I cry my dog will sit in my lap and look at me and will have tears also like she understands what I'm going through. When I told her I was engaged she ran around a barked and played like she was celebrating too. Now she probably doesn't know everything I'm saying just probably the tones of my voice, but when i had a cat and cried she walked off like she didn't care.|`|9b25119676cb60c00708b15f0c12ac6eaa	I always had cats growing up, and I honestly believe cats are smarter than dogs. For example when a dog gets lost, more than likely you'll have to post a missing dog poster with a reward, when a cat gets lost, if they don't get hit by a car or kidnapped by some clingy pet loving human, eventually they will find their way home.|`|af1fe9ebe396bd1dc330674aa3329c96aa	My boss' dog eats old paper tissues from the bin.<br>  <br>  My cat turns its nose up at Whisker's packet food if he had the same thing the day before.<br>  <br>  Cats win.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Basically it is how you view intelligence: short term, long term and also consider that the two species differ in that a cat is more prone to be a predator and more independent (thus not really as interested in companionship as a dog would).<br>  Dogs love to please and actually WANT companionship as well as giving :)<br>  <br>  "According to researchers at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, the physical structure of human brains and that of cats are very similar; they have the same lobes in the cerebral cortex (the "seat" of intelligence) as humans do. Human brains also function the same way, conveying data via identical neurotransmitters. [3]"<br>  <br>  "Cats learn by trial and error, observation and imitation.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]... recalling certain information much longer than dogs.[14] In one study, it was found that cats possess visual memory ability comparable to that of monkeys.[15] However, for short term working memory, at least one study showed that dogs outperformed cats for periods of time up to 60 seconds.[16]"|`|Ds4xCthSaa	I believe so. I believe dogs are smarter because: <br>  <br>  1) they just are<br>  2) dogs can relate better to humans, they can even sense your mood<br>  3) have ever heard of the military or police force using cats?<br>  4) cats can't be figured out, they are like moody, and you never know when they are going to turn on you<br>  5) have you ever seen the cat whisperer? you haven't Lord knows they are too hard to train<br>  <br>  I think they don't understand all that we say to them, but I think they do understand alot.|`|mRevWUxlaa	YES THEY DO!!! And they also understand what you are saying. I tell my two dogs "Crate" OR "Lay Down" or "Cookie" or "Leave it"....... What Im saying, is that they do understand and they will talk to you as well, weather it be by barking, whimpering, my male Yodels....LOL! And through body language. When you can understand what each sound and expression means with your dog, you will then understand what they are saying as well!!! Hence, the Human-Canine Lingo!!!! =)<br>  <br>  Cats are very smart as well, they understand but are stubborn and dont obey as a dog. That does not mean that they are not as intelligent. Regaurdless of which is smarter, the fact is, dogs are more loyal maybe. Cats are just as loving as a dog but more independent. =)|`|XnEnelsBaa	The old joke says:<br>  Dogs are like men, Cats are more like women!<br>  Which is smarter? Do they understand when you talk to them?<br>  <br>  It depends on what criteria you decide to measure intelligence, this is much more complicated across species than it sounds. A dog has all the qualities needed to be a dog. A cat has all the qualities it needs to be a cat! They understand enough of our behaviour to be successful as pets.<br>  <br>  Some of earth's lower life forms will still be thriving zillions of years after the 'smart' human species has died out!|`|SXfFI05Gaa	I do believe dogs understand you when you talk to them.<br>  My dog understands full sentences when I'm talking to her, and performs the action that I am explaining. Usually people will train their dogs with one-word commands.<br>  Cats and Dogs are smart in their own ways, and in some ways dog are even smarter than human beings.<br>  We're smart with technology, they're smart with their noses.<br>  Every animal is smart in their own way.<br>  Honestly I own two cats and a dog. My cats can be pretty stupid, and so can my dog; but equally they're both smart.|`|iVapI5JPaa	It depends on how you define intelligence. Besides how do we know? Maybe you just can't get a cat to participate in an intelligence test or they are less enthusiastic, so they may SEEM less intelligent but may not be. Maybe a dog is too excited to participate in the test all the time. How can we really measure it?<br>  <br>  However, one animal that is considered just as smart as your cat or dog is one you may eat: the pig!|`|pXD36Lglaa	Yes they do understand for I am a dog whisperer and I know how to read and talk to dogs, some things they do not get but with a few given clues they will get it right off the bat.|`|FrbtkAWcaa	No they can not understand words, they understand voice inflection, and tone.  Also they work through association.  Hope this helps|`|Vlm36hvDaa	i think so<br>  <br>  they have dogs that can say "i love you". so... i think they can understand a a lot of things. afterall, most dogs at least know sit.|`|AA12358887	Mine do.  I've read in some dog book that dogs can understand as much words as a 5 year-old human.  Cats are cool but there not as loyal as a good dog.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	I've had both, and both have always understood me.  However, I do think my cats are smarter, maybe just because they don't just blindly obey me, plus they've managed to train me!|`|AOpH80A3aa	they dont. they just memorize the sound of the command then do the corresponding act u taught them.<br>  <br>  i think dogs are more "tamable" than cats|`|2xycmzW5aa	Dogs man's best friend for a reason. I'm sure they can't understand you tho. My dog is the one "person" i can vent to and he never complains. lol|`|B8VGmTaqaa	hell ya they are can a cat sit can a cat roll over nooo
