UCq7SjsRaa	Well, I've spoken about this with friend's before (what a group of intellectuals we are!) and we came to the conclusion that it's a normal bodily reaction.

qrGLcTh4aa	Bump on the gum is indeed an abscess. More than likely means he has an infection and needs a root canal. Typically, when a person has an abscess they will not have "pain" due to the fact that the infection(puss) is draining out of the bump. He should go to the dentist as soon as possible.|`|AA11601031	Sounds like an abcess.  Take him to the dentist ASAP.
F0FByGiQaa	I read this on a site:<br>  <br>  "to answer the question, "Are cold sores contagious?" According to health studies they are and through many different ways. One of the most direct ways is through bursting a cold sore. If the liquid makes contact with someone else's skin, that person is then affected."<br>  <br>  Here is also a link. <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Are-Cold-Sores-Contagious?&id=73220" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Are-Cold-Sores...</a> <br>  <br>  Everything I am reading sums it up to it is easily spreadable.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	Herpes is spread by direct skin to skin contact. Unlike a flu virus that you can get through the air, herpes spreads by direct contact, that is, directly from the site of infection to the site of contact. For example, if you have a cold sore and kiss someone, you can transfer the virus to their mouth. Similarly, if you have active genital herpes and have vaginal or anal intercourse, you can give your partner genital herpes. Finally, if you have a cold sore and put your mouth on your partners genitals (oral sex), you can give your partner genital herpes.<br>  <br>  When Is Herpes Most Likely To Be Spread?<br>  <br>  Herpes is most easily spread when a sore is present, but, it is also often spread at other times too. Some people notice itching, tingling or other sensations before they see anything on their skin. These are called "Prodromal Symptoms" and they warn that virus may be present on the skin. Herpes is most likely to be spread from the time these first symptoms are noticed until the area is completely healed and the skin looks normal again. Sexual contact (oral, vaginal, or anal) is very risky during this time.<br>  <br>  Can Herpes Be Transmitted Without Symptoms?<br>  <br>  Yes! Sometimes those who know they are infected spread the virus between outbreaks, when no signs or symptoms are present. This is called "Asymptomatic Transmission."<br>  Research also shows that herpes simplex infections are often spread by people who don't know they are infected. These people may have symptoms so mild they don't notice them at all or else don't recognize them as herpes.<br>  <br>  Many genital herpes infections are spread from persons who are asymptomatic "Shedders" of the virus.<br>  <br>  For those who recognize their symptoms, asymptomatic transmission appears to be far less likely than spreading the virus when lesions are present. Many couples have had sexual relations for years without transmitting herpes. Some simply avoid having sexual contact when signs or symptoms are present. Others use condoms or other protection between outbreaks to help protect against asymptomatic shedding.<br>  <br>  Are complications possible?<br>  <br>  One kind of complication involves spreading the virus from the location of an outbreak to other places on the body by touching the sore(s). The fingers, eyes, and other body areas can accidentally become infected in this way. Preventing self-infection is simple. Do not touch the area during an outbreak. If you do, wash your hands as soon as possible. The herpes virus is easily killed with soap and water.<br>  <br>  What about pregnancy? Can babies get herpes?<br>  <br>  Babies can become infected with the herpes virus. If you've been exposed to herpes, you need to talk with your doctor about it before you get pregnant. This is important even if you've never had symptoms or haven't had a recurrence in a long time. The doctor might arrange a test to see if virus is present when you go into labor. In addition, you should be examined to see if you have herpes at labor and should notify the doctor if you think you have active symptoms at that time.<br>  <br>  If no virus is found in the birth canal and there are no symptoms or signs of an outbreak, a vaginal delivery is considered safe. If herpes is present in the birth canal near the time of delivery, a cesarean section might be necessary to protect the newborn from coming into direct contact with the virus.<br>  <br>  Babies also can get herpes if they are kissed by someone with a cold sore. A young baby cannot fight off infections as easily as an adult can, so serious problems might result. It's important that you do not kiss a baby when you have a cold sore.<br>  <br>  Can herpes cause AIDS?<br>  <br>  Herpes simplex virus is not related to Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS. Studies suggest that sores or lesions in the genital area make a person more prone to HIV infection if they have sex with someone carrying HIV. This may be because sores create breaks in the skin of the genitals and make it easier for HIV to get into the body. Given that herpes causes such lesions, it is extremely important to avoid sex during outbreaks. Further research is being conducted in this area.|`|AA10607487	check the link below . hope it helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/herpes_simplex_infections_non-genital/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/herpes_simple...</a>
qrGLcTh4aa	I have been a Dental Assistant for 10 years. It is a great job! It's not for everybody, but if it's for you than you will enjoy it. I worked with a guy that was an assistant. He felt a little intimidated initially, but after awhile he grew to love it. Also, if you want to pursue a field in Dentistry, Dental Hygiene is a great career. You're right, it's predominantly a woman's field but I have known men to do it too.  Starting pay as an assistant ,depending on where you live, is around 12 dollars an hour. I now make 21 dollars an hour.<br>  <br>  Dental hygiene school lasts 1-3 years. New hygienists earn about about 33 dollars an hour nation wide.<br>  <br>  Go for it and good luck!!|`|NLAek2bJaa	Dental Assisting is an awesome job. You can learn so much about your teeth and a positive thing is that you will always have a job no matter what. There are always jobs open for healthcare. It may seem like its a woman only position but there are males that can do it too. I agree with the short schooling. It made it worth it. Well, dental assistants get paid depending on their experience so you may start out at 10-12 an hour but over time, it will raise after years of experience.

Other causes are certain medications, hypothyroidism, certain skin conditions or vaginitis. You might want to see a doctor to make sure there is not an underlying medical condition causing your vaginal dryness. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, you and your partner should invest in some high quality lube. Not only with this lubricate your vagina, it can also increase sensitivity and make sex more fun. Never, I mean never use a spray bottle of water. That is ridiculous and will not work.

Hormone wise I mean. With age our hormones also change. That could be the problem. Anything that can change your hormones will do it. If you've recently switched birth control or gone off it that can do it. If you're pregnant, that can do it too. You may want to go to your gyno and just get a check up. Let him or her know that this is going on. Unitl then, use KY or something similar.

They helped me some.<br>  <br>  There are theories that too much cleanliness aids in the development of allergies.  I helped a friend build a barn and a house and during that 3 years there were no facilities for hand washing.  I was out there eating dirt 5 days a week.  Never washed our hands - even when cooking or eating.  There were flies everywhere.  My allergies are GONE.  5 years now - no allergies at all.   I had allergies for 40 years - bad allergies Mar to November - or when ever the freeze occurred.  Eating dirt seemed to cure my allergies.

Only 10% of hpv infections turn into cervical cancer. As far as your husband reinfecting you, it has been said that partners share hpv until both of your immune systems eliminate or supress the virus. You cant be reinfected with the strain that you already have unless it has gone away and you are infected with a different strain of hpv. Now as hard as this sounds, dont stress yourself out. Stress takes a toll on your immune system and your immune system needs to be in top shape so that you can get rid of hpv or supress it. Take vitamins (antioxidants), quit smoking if you do smoke, work out, eat healthy, and STOP stressing. The worst thing about having HPV is the toll it takes on you mental state. You will be ok. Try to take this experience and channel it in a positive way. You are not alone.

You may be worried about your body's development, about what causes breast soreness, and even about cancer.<br>  <br>  If you're a girl, you may have noticed a slightly sore feeling when you wash your breasts in the shower. Or maybe you felt an ache when you've rolled onto your stomach in bed. Sometimes it may have felt like your breasts gained 10 pounds overnight<br>  <br>  The timing of breast development varies from girl to girl. Most girls begin getting breasts around 10 or 11, but it's normal for breast development to start anytime between the ages of 8 and 13. In general, it takes 4 to 5 years for a girl's breasts to reach their adult size.<br>  <br>  It is also common to have sore breasts around the beginning of a girl's period, or menstruation. Before her period starts, a girl's body produces lots of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone.<br>  <br>  Changes in these hormones can cause feelings that together are called premenstrual syndrome, or PMS. Some girls have painful cramps in their stomachs, headaches, mood swings, or cravings for certain foods right before their periods begin. During this time the body may retain water, which can make a girl feel puffy and bloated. Rings and shoes may feel tight at this time.<br>  <br>  Just as fingers and feet swell, so can breasts. All that fluid forces the breast tissues to expand, which stretches the nerves and makes breasts feel achy or tender.<br>  <br>  Breast swelling and tenderness can also be one of the earliest signs of pregnancy.

zTl5Zjcqaa	Yes. CIPA is a genetic mutation which prevents the development of cells which carry the electrical signals for pain, heat and cold to the brain. Pleasure is mainly derived from the body releasing dopamine, not from your nerves. For instance, when someone you have strong feelings for touches your arm, its not the touching that makes you feel good, its the fact that its someone special, your body releases dopamine as a way trying to keep you calm.<br>  <br>  Sexual pleasure is from a stimulation of a large cluster of nerves in a single spot. CIPA does not affect this, just like it doesn't affect pressure or touch. Having CIPA does not mean you are numb, you just have the inability to feel pain, heat or cold.<br>  <br>  By the way, CIPA is not a disease. Its Congenital, which means from birth. It's not contagious.

enn4OfAWaa	I've actually had something close to me die last year...it was my grandma. She's not my mom obviously but she was literally like my second mom. She had diabetes and in Feb. of 2008 she went into a coma. She woke up after 3 weeks but she couldn't sit up, eat, talk or anything like that. All she could do was just lay in a bed and stare at you. The doctors kept telling us she was never gonna come out of this stage and after 3 months in the hospital they couldn't hold her because there was nothing left they could do for her. So our only options were to put her in a nursing home or have her stay with one of her kids. My grandpa wanted nothing to do with a nursing home (which I didn't blame him because nursing homes don't take care of their patients) so me and my mom (my grandma's daughter) and my dad and grandpa decided we were gonna take care of her in our house. That was very hard because me and my mom had to learn how to use the machines and feed her throught the feeding tube. We even had to change her when she went to the bathroom since she coudn't move. I took a month off of work to take care of her while my mom was at work. Then on June 9 of 2008 she passed away during the night. We woke up the next morning to her dead helpless body laying in the bed. It was the worst thing I have ever seen. I have never seen a dead body like that before. Then the mortuary guys came put her in a bag and took her away. Worst experience of my life. I still am f*cked up about it. But all i can say is I'm sorry for your loss and I know what your going through. I don't think people fully recover from the death of a loved one. It's just too hard. But the best thing you can do is think of all the things you loved about that person and think of all the good charasteristics of them. But I wish you well.|`|ubj2hZWZaa	talk to Jesus about it.

My best friend just lost her mother last September.  I have lost a few close people in my life and am now 35.  The first time I lost someone close was when i was 14.  I didn't know how to deal with this and made some bad choices.  One day while doing the bad things I decided to try to go to a church that my parents tried to take me to, when i was 12.  It was the best decision in my life.  After a few weeks of going to church I quit doing the things that hurt me and made me remember all of my losses and bad memories of the past.  I also decided to accept Jesus Christ.  The moment I opened my heart to God and let him take all my sadness and loss and sin, I felt a weight lifted from me.  Long story short...I strongly recommend giving your grief to God and asking him to let your loved one rest in peace.  Then she will rest and so will your heart.  She will always be with you.  Try to remember only the good memories and let God take your anger and sadness.    I hope this helps.|`|vBcZZRx5aa	First of all I want to say sorry for your loss, I know that there is no way that I can understand what you are going through.  I have lost people who are close to me and I know it can be hard.  Even though it has been 5 years, just remember that it is perfectly normal to still have feelings of guilt, sadness, anger etc. about it.  It is a major life event and you are still young.  As Dr. Phil said "Time doesn't heal all wounds, its what you do in that time that makes you heal."  I am sure you have heard the counseler talk, but it really does help to have a neutral person to talk to, that can help you find ways to develop coping skills.  My counceler once said when you start feeling blue, start moving.  Get up, exercise (which is good to release endorhines and they naturally make you happy), clean, play with an animal etc.  Also make sure to validate your feelings and know that it is ok to feel the way you are feeling.  I wish you the best, you will be in my prayers.

K8wi44Oqaa	do cardio and crunches, but instead of lifting your upper body during the crunches, maintain your back on the floor and lift your legs (straight legs) toward your chest. That's a very good one
dpgXzMenaa	That's a normal feeling when you're close to orgasm.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure.  It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation.  You will *definitely* know when you have one.  There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm.  Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee).  The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm in one or more of these ways, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  Then you'll know what one is and how to have one, for sure.<br>  <br>  Have fun and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, learning what pleases you sexually is good for you, and when it comes to having sex with the one you *want*, you'll be able to tell them (or to show them if you like) the things you like best.|`|DZimLaLuaa	its normal its just fine when i get an orgasm i haave to pee to sometimes|`|l7GjBVvhaa	The sensation, or pressure, you're experiencing can be felt for various reasons, the obvious one being that you do actually need to pee. In that case you can stop and have a pee or you could, go to the toilet before you have sex to make sure your bladder is empty. It's also true that some sexual positions can add pressure on the bladder and give you the impression you need a pee when you don't.<br>  <br>  Another reason for this can be anxiety related to having sex or fear of loosing control of your bodily functions when having sex or when having an orgasm. It's unlikely this would happen and, again, going to the loo before having sex could make you more relaxed about any anxiety you may have. <br>  <br>  IMy best advice is go to your gyno and have them help you out. Experiencing a need to pee during sex isn't unusual and it's unlikely something is wrong. f all else fails go to your gyno it isn't fair for you or your parnter.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you.

Everything that you consume on a daily basis, collects on your teeth and over time causes decay to form and eat away the teeth.

There are many things that can happen and cause abscessed teeth and you would be in more pain than you could imagine. There are so many things that I could go off about.

6NZeItMAaa	Studies of the heart and the blood were made during actual heart attacks by Electrocardiographs and other scientific instruments. It was found that when the blood stream contained its peak load of fat content, the heart attacks were most severe and threatened the very life of the patients. Such findings were also the experience of other research physicians.<br>  <br>   We are all agreed: the cholesterol found in the blood is made largely in the liver from fats in the diet. It is also believed that cholesterol is produced in the arterial walls themselves. But the main source and the one that we can to a great extent control is fat in our food.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Cholesterol is transported in blood plasma. Cholesterol is a chemical which is produced in the liver. It comes from fats that we eat. Some cholesterol is needed- it helps to form cell membranes, hormones and various other uses. If we eat too much fat, the more cholesterol is present in the bloodstream and this causes problems.<br>  <br>  High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) or good cholesterol are lipoproteins which can be transported from tissues of the body to the liver where it is got rid of. Low Density Lipoprotein or bad cholesterol deposit cholesterol on the artery walls- this leads to plaques bulding up over time.<br>  <br>  The higher the total cholesterol level the greater the risk to your health. Having high blood cholesterol levels will lead to atheroma (fatty plaques) building up inside the lining of arteries, this is known as atherosclerosis, which basically means hardening of the arteries. If plaques of atheroma will build up over time and can cause the artery to become narrow, constricting the artery which will reduce blood flow. This can cause angina, heart attacks and strokes.

But in either case I'd get to a doctor and find out. It could be something really, really serious. See a doctor right away.|`|qV8Vz36Iaa	This is called a sexual headache: The  "orgasmic headache" occurs before orgasm and is likely to be related to the vascular system. It could be a rupture of a cerebral blood vessel.<br>  <br>  As a precaution, until you see your doctor, you might want to reduce your sodium intake. I'd also reduce your calories through fats and oils on the assumption that it is vascular. You only need about 1 teaspoon of fat in your diet per day according to Dr. Dean Ornish. It's easy enough to check your blood pressure at any drugstore. Most have blood pressure gauges. Some firehouses will measure blood pressure as a service to the community.<br>  <br>  If this is the cause, I'd suggest that you go on a low-fat vegetarian diet as recommended by Dr. Dean Ornish. I'd also consult with your doctor about building up to an aerobic exercise program.<br>  <br>  Do you have the same symptom when you exercise? I'd make sure to get a handle on all of your symptoms before you see your doctor. This will help him with the diagnosis.|`|AA10500537	ask your dr could be serious

AA11659150	Maybe you didn't get enough sleep?  If you are preteen and haven't started yet, then yes, you could certainly be experiencing some hormonal swings related to menstruation.  More than likely, this feeling will go away in a few days (or after your period goes away).  If it does not, tell an adult that you are feeling this way so that you can talk to your doctor about it.  It isn't something to be scared of or alarmed about.  We all feel sad sometimes and being a girl dealing with you period can certainly make you feel that way, although it shouldn't be so bad that it interferes with your enjoyment of life.  Try to relax and do something that makes you happy, get some rest, drink lots of water and keep an eye on your emotions.

I wore glasses for about 8 years prior and could never find contacts that worked for me. It was a gift from my hubby for my 30th birthday (and the best one I've ever gotten!)<br>  <br>  After the procedure I was told to go home and sleep for about 4 hours - this is when the "flap" reseals. They gave me Valium before the procedure and a sleeping pill for afterward (I had my procedure early in the morning). I went back for a follow-up exam later that same day and I was already 20/20. There was some discomfort (like a sandy feeling) and watery eyes that first day, but that was gone by the next day. Bright lights, especially the fluorescent lighting in my office bugged me for a while, but that too went away. Also had some "halos" at night, but not anymore. <br>  <br>  I had my surgery on a Friday and went to a football game the next night.

dpgXzMenaa	Perfectly normal.  Fingering yourself is normal at any age at all.<br>  <br>  There's no such thing as "being too young" for that.<br>  <br>  I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex...<br>  <br>  ... and the "wanting sex" part is just your body growing up and telling you it's thinking about reproducing - and you don't have to do what it's after... masturbation is pretty good sex all by itself.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	It is normal phase you are going through.<br>  <br>  You are experiencing sexual arousal that is all.<br>  <br>  Self masturbating is normal, can do so if you wish.<br>  <br>  Just only have sex if you are emotionally and physically ready.<br>  <br>  Sex is big step and it comes with a lot of maturity to handle it right.<br>  <br>  Many young people have it when not ready in one or both areas.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your body and find what best suits you are you enjoy.

Even babies do it, because it feels pleasurable.  Hopefully, since you are only 12, and having sex is a big step both physically and emotionally, you won't do it so young.  Just take care of yourself for now, and don't feel weird or like there's anything wrong with it.  It would be nice if you could buy yourself a little vibrator, too, but I think you have to be 18, and if you got it in the mail, it might raise some questions that you SHOULD, but probably don't want to discuss with your parents right now.

Often the cause isn't clear.<br>  The low back pain syndrome is a vicious cycle in which injury causes muscle spasm, the spasm induces pain, and the pain results in additional muscle spasm. The injury must heal by itself. To heal most rapidly, you must avoid reinjury. Either rest flat on your back for the first 24 hours, or be very, very careful.<br>  Heat applied to the affected area will provide some relief. You may take acetaminophen, aspirin,ibuprofen, or naproxen as long as you feel significant pain. If significant pain persists beyond a week, call the doctor. And good luck.|`|lNsr26oIaa	You need to go have that checked out. You don't want to risk further injury until you know what is going on.
rnUr1JJ7aa	um u Better Go To The Hospital If u Wanna Live GO TO THE DOCTOR!|`|df4e97f8ed63fdc485309fd8289b886baa	are you sure its not a yeast infection and UTI? do you know the diffrence|`|wdmpxNU1aa	It's important you go in to be checked.  It sounds like a yest infection, but you should be tested for all stds to be safe.  I'm sorry you feel so ashamed.  Hopefully all will be fine, but even if you are not, it can happen to any of us.  You learn, and next time use protection and demand proof of their health. Good luck to you|`|ggW6T1yCaa	i have the same thing i dunno wat to do either im embarrest, hopefully it is a yeast infection nothing else|`|Vw7Ji0zUaa	you probably have a yeast infection
L6ZEQxvLaa	See if it would be okay to take Olive Leaf Extract and Oil of Oregano on a regular basis to shun infections.<br>  <br>  ♂<br>  ♀|`|BG8vMyZjaa	I am so sorry for your loss.<br>  There is some good information in the posts above.<br>  Eat a sensible diet, look after yourself.  I am sure your dreadful experience is a distressing one off.<br>  Good luck and a healthy baby in the future|`|F1OIGwtBaa	I'm so sorry for pain - and understand your fears. I lost 3 babies in the first four months before I was able to carry one to term. The fears of the next pregnancy are so real and overwhelming.<br>  <br>  There are many things you can do to boost your immune system and support healthy hormone function throughout the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Immune support - there is an awesome product by mannatech.com called ImmunoStart. It does wonders for helping a person stay healthy or fight an infection once it is present. It's a food product - no chemicals or drugs - making it safe to take any time, even throughout pregnancy. It's all organic, too. Even my 20 year old son keeps it handy at college in case he starts to come down with something as he has seen the benefits many times over the past several years that we've used it in our household.<br>  <br>  Fresh garlic and ginger are also natural immune supports. You can get ginger root teabags - delicious! (I wouldn't try garlic tea!!  lol) Another supplement that is very good for immune support is olive leaf. I believe that's safe throughout pregnancy, but I'd do some more research before acting solely on this post. One more good one is colloidal minerals. This link gives a good product at a good price.<br>  <a href="http://www.vitacost.com/Source-Naturals-Colloidalife" rel="nofollow">http://www.vitacost.com/Source-Naturals-...</a><br>  Again, I think this would be safe during pregnancy, but do your own research or asked a naturopathic physician.<br>  <br>  For hormones - Some of the best herbal hormone supports are red raspberry leaf, dong quai, and black cohosh. They are all mild and will help strengthen your feminine hormones. I am absolutely sure that red raspberry is safe throughout pregnancy - very soothing and will help your milk come in. The other two are good for boosting your hormone function prior to conceiving, but you'll have to do research as to what is safe through pregnancy (all of these are very mild)<br>  <br>  As for doing research, the absolute best site online is www.lef.org. This company searches worldwide for what herbs or drugs are used for what purposes and with what results. They believe in prudent use of both medicines and herbs and research both dilligently. They also make some of the finest, most trusted supplements available (though very expensive). LEF has put out a monthly magazine for about 25 years. The archives of every issue are available online for free to all users (you don't have to sign up or become a member). I highly recommend this site as the best authority on meds and herbs available to all on the web.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. God Bless you and your child. May you find the answers you seek to fill your heart's desire for another child.

EKoRHgdgaa	Cold sores are very common and as to the herpes think, stop stressing out, most people are carriers and it does not affect them (and no, it is not the sexual transmitted kind, it is different).  No one is going to think less of you because you have a cold sore.  You can treat it with over the counter products like Abreva.  :o)<br>  <br>  Here is some information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://firstaid.webmd.com/cold-sores-treatment" rel="nofollow">http://firstaid.webmd.com/cold-sores-tre...</a>|`|evB63qWvaa	A lot of people have cold sores.  Also, there are two kinds of herpes.  The first kind is that which makes cold sores.  It's common amoung people.  It's true that there is no cure for it, but things like Carmex usually help them go away faster.  The second kind is genital herpes that you can get from sex.  The first kind you can get just from kissing someone that is infected with it, even if it's just a light peck on the lips.|`|a162de189aa1c1becbdbb0cd4b7cd67caa	hehe omg no.  almost everyone i know has gotten a cold sore.  there is nothing to worry about.  and yes it is a form of herpes, but it's nothing really bad.  just go to the local pharmacy and by some abreva or something like that.  altho just be warned that little tube of medicine costs like $20.  but it does make it go away. <br>  <br>  you can catch a cold sore just from kissing someone or drinking from the same glass.  <br>  <br>  really it's not that big of a deal.  just looks icky for a little while.|`|epMuO4Cgaa	just because cold sores are infected with herpes doesnt mean it is a type of STD.

Then rinse the lip with warm water!|`|dSd5reJdaa	It's estimated that at some point 24% of people have had a coldsore at some point.

7q9MN1Wkaa	Usually, you would pull back the foreskin (gently) and then go to it.  Unless his glans is extra-sensitive, which is the case for some uncircumcised guys (in my experience).  If that's the case, then leave the glans covered.<br>  <br>  During sex the foreskin would naturally slide back & forth in your vagina.  If it's really tight, then it may stay over the head even thru sex.  Best way is to ask him what he likes, or pay attention to his reactions as you are pleasuring him.<br>  <br>  My BF loves it when I stick my tongue into his foreskin & swirl it around (in between his glans & foreskin)!  Other uncircumcised guys I've been with like this too.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	what! what! you treat it no different than a circumcised penis.  just make sure ole boy is cleaned of smegma.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	the same way you do it with a circumcised guy<br>  <br>  just put it in your mouth and suck it, oh and play with the skin bc it has tons of nerve endings so it'll feel good|`|ehnxg6Utaa	ask him.

QMScxXGYaa	u should try Activia (it is a sort of laban) 4 15  days n avoid ginger n garlic or other foods which increase acidity.|`|rrZm9cWXaa	It seems as though if you take the over the counter drugs you must take them well before you eat. I have the same issue. I had ulcers. Spices, Eggs, Beans, Orange (juice),Onions,Tomato, Green Vegetables, and Milk really kick it up a notch! You could have a number of things going on with you it is hard to tell. you could have problems with acid and indigestion. <br>  I find that sometimes I have to eat blandly to not turn into a bubble of gas! LOL! Try to line your stomach before you eat a meal with maybe a piece of white or wheat bread and watch the spices (or triggers) If you want to treat it yourself try Mylanta. Warning it doesn't taste good. Or you can also try rolaids. (These have the same effect as a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda dissolved in a 1/2 glass of water every 2 hours- it's nasty too but effective) <br>  You may talk to a dr. or pharmacist for better guidance. These have been my personal remedies
b637df4c5d99edf4bd75147b1fdb49d3aa	If you are using someone else's urine, make sure that the urine is at body temperature when you use it.  Some places check the temp. to make sure that it's fresh.  If the urine is not close to body temp. when you hand them the sample, they can reject the test, or even make you take it again.<br>  <br>  Also, some "smoke shops" sell synthetic urine that you can use.

And you screw up big time.|`|rrZm9cWXaa	If the drug test is a hair sample there is no way around that one sorry to say. But you will need to clean up pretty fast - go get golden seal and take the recommendeddaily dosage. for the next two days AND drink water all day from now until the time of the test. If you are a chronic user this may not work for you well but it is worth a shot. Also if you are using someone else's urine use a non lubricated non spermicide condom to be sure no chemical effects your results.

614tYbzxaa	Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus. Once you get the virus you risk outbreaks for the rest of your life , as the virus does not leave the body, but they occur less frequently after the age of 35.<br>  When you feel a tingle or irritation before the outbreak use Zovirax or Vectavir. The cream will reduce the severity of the outbreak. Viruses thrive on a low immune system caused by , tiredness, stress or other illnesses.<br>  An inbalance of amino acids Lysine and arginine is thought to be a contributing factor in herpes virus outbreaks. Foods which contain high levels of Lysine include most vegetables, legumes, fish, turkey and chicken. Patients should take 1000mg of Lysine supplements 3 times a day during an outbreak.<br>  Vitamin B complex is also known to help with cold sores as this vitamin supports the nervous system where viruses hide out.

Further, the hazards that people speak of are grossly overstated.  <br>  <br>  Some people speak of the danger that an object will fall on a barefoot person's foot, causing him or her injury.  However, the foot is no less exposed to this danger when one wears flip-flops, sandals or many other styles of footwear.<br>  <br>  Similarly, others discuss the risk that one will have difficulties with footing when walking barefoot or will step on something on a store floor.  Admittedly, an inattentive barefooter who misses large pieces of broken glass beneath his feet is likely to wish he was paying better attention, but this is an extraordinarily rare event (in part because barefooters know to pay attention where they walk).  Vastly more common, particularly in the context of stores, are conventional slips and falls, and I can say with certainty that one is far less likely to slip when barefoot than, say, when wearing high-heels or slick-soled flat shoes.<br>  <br>  Finally, others still will argue that going barefoot exposes people to germs and dirt that make going barefoot in public (because there are obviously no germs in our own homes) hazardous.  This ignores the fact that the foot, when open to the air, is not going to incur the risk of catching fungal infections like athlete's foot and the like.  Those who catch athlete's foot and the like have created the perfect environment for the spread of disease by creating a wam, dark and moist environment around the foot (i.e. wearing shoes and socks and then running around so as to make one's feet sweat).  Compare that to the barefooter who will have dirty foot bottoms but no fungal growths on his or her feet, and I think there is little reason for concern.<br>  <br>  The above being said, I do not recommend going barefoot in all circumstances.  Extreme cold, for example, is good reason to wear shoes to keep one's feet warm.  If you're working in a hard-hat area at a job site, it's best to have good boots.  However, these instances are exceptions to the general rule that is actually better for one's feet to go barefoot.<br>  <br>  So, yes, there's nothing wrong with going barefoot in the vast majority of cases.  Most of the objection to barefooting has its roots in an outdated prejudice linking barefooting to poverty and the "ick" factor that has developed over time as a result of the same.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the question.|`|XbZIicftaa	I used to do that all the time.  Then I lost my tolerance to cold for some reason and got used to wearing shoes all the time (and socks in the house!!!!  I used to HATE that!)|`|LhafPeY1aa	Me, I go barefoot in public all the time, to places like shopping centres and also when I hang out with friends

In fact, eating smaller meals more often during the day is a great way to speed up your metabolism and lose weight.|`|yZLiLUxOaa	yes. it is better to just eat 5-7 small portion HEALTHY meals everyday. That way your calorie intake isnt AS high. and you still have a high metabolism. it is better to snack than starve|`|SQ39aHSoaa	if you snack on the wrong foods it is.  like sweets, chips, pop, fried food.  snack on healthy foods like yogurt, fruit, small amounts of cheese or nuts.
3d1XRIzkaa	Yes, that is a very good choice. But you might limit the cheese, or use some Fat Free cheese slices.  Use mustard, or Fat Free mayo. Mustard has no fat in it. Make you wash your tomato before slicing it, to get any chemicals off it.|`|elJHDb1jaa	Never had turkey cheese before. I bet its expensive and hard to produce.|`|qImMwhUHaa	Bread isn't low carb but if it's whole wheat bread then it's fine for you. Use fat free or no mayo and mustard is fine. Load up with the veggies and keep cheese to a minimum. It depends on what your goal is as to what is a good option. If you are looking to loose weight the low carb way then you should avoid bread and flour products.
JzY8x9Umaa	Exercising twice a week is not enough. You need to work out at least 5 days a week. In addition to your aerobic class jog three days, like Tues. Thur. and Fri. that way you get your five days in. 2 days is not going to help even though it's better than nothing I know. If you cant jog, then walk at a fast pace for thirty minutes non-stop, if you can jog 30 minutes non-stop that's even better. Dont eat 3 hours before bed, just water, along with reasonable diet, and five days of exercise, you will be on your way. You can do it. Good luck!|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	To be overweight basically means your diet hasn't been good. What will have happened is your liver will be clogged and unable to burn fat efficiently. I'm speaking from experience when I say you should do a diet based liver cleanse. It lasts 8 weeks and you do not have to starve, only change the type of food you eat.<br>  <br>  Eliminate red meat, animal fats, dairy, processed food and anything containing chemicals or additives. Replace with fish/seafood (nothing fried), lean chicken, lots of vegetables (raw is better) and fruit, whole wheat pasta, bread and rice. Drink lots of water to flush it all through. Try fresh raw veggie juices in the mornings if you have a juicer. These are very cleansing for your liver.<br>  <br>  I lose 1 - 2 kg per week when I do this. I also limit myself to 1200-1400 cal per day but I'm a small frame, you may ned to increase that a bit for yourself.<br>  <br>  I've attached some articles below that explain things a little more, offer tips and an example diet plan. Hope you like it. Personally I will never do anything else but this. Good luck.|`|OMYd6p3gaa	You will have to eat less and work out more. Your body couldnt be in shock because you have been taking these classes since Jan. 12th. Thats over a month, your body would have adjusted by now. You could be eating bad foods. Eat lots of veggies and drink lots of water, also lower your intake of carbs. Good luck!|`|3Ks21ASDaa	You're probably more in shape but when it comes to losing weight you need to change your eating habits also. If your eating habits don't change then you won't lose any weight.

It is great you are being consistent with your exercise, however, in order to start seeing some real gains (or losses), you'll need to increase the amount of time you workout to at least 3 but preferably 4 or 5 times a week.  Now, not all of the workouts need to be intense, but brisk walking or easy jogging in the morning, or something like that. <br>  <br>  It's important to keep consistent, otherwise your body will not see the results you are looking for.  I can almost guarantee that if you start working out 4-5 times a week, some intense days, others easy days, you will shed lbs and tone up more quickly than you'd even imagine.<br>  <br>  Also, look into your diet and make sure that you are not eating more calories than your are expending... ofcourse exercising more will help with that!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little,<br>  <br>  Dennis|`|yXr3O7uDaa	Hey!

On the other four or five days I'd suggest the following:<br>  Breakfast:<br>  An egg with whole grain bread or a half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great. <br>  Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it. <br>  Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...<br>  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt.

7MzazcQkaa	It sounds like he's a nice guy. But it also sounds like you like the attention he gives and the love. I don't mean that judgmentally but just the impression i got. While it's great to have people in your life who care about you maybe this guy would be a better friend than boyfriend for you. Something is clearly holding you back, whether it makes sense or not it's holding you back. I believe when it's the right person there are no reservations, no doubts whatsoever. Funny thing is im in the same situation as you im 25 with a 32 yr old. This guy sounds very very serious about you.

I have different reasons for being unable to let my husband in still!!!  But he is the same way! all lovey and all about me.  He's my "prince charming"  but Sometimes I feel overwhelmed or like he's a little bit too much for me.  Like I wasn't clingy enough.  He used to joke and tell me I was the boy in our relationship.  However in good time, you will be able to fully accept him and his love.  However it will take nothing short of time.  Your best bet is to openly tell the man you love exactly what you feel and what the reasons are that contribute to why you may feel this way.  Be sure to tell him it's not his fault and if he indeed worships the ground you walk on etc. then he will work with you to get a comfort zone, or happy medium.  Maybe you can have an "alone day" each week.  I have one still and still need it.  Some people are just more independent overall than others.  You're independent because your life made you that way.  He will understand and you two will grow more together if you are open and honest with him.  Also tell him that you don't mean to or want to push him away.|`|oKoABzNtaa	It might just be more attention than you really want. There's nothing wrong with that.

Talk to him about how it makes you feel and let him know that you're working through some issues and  that you need his support in order to get things right for you. Until you work out your own issues, you won't be able to work out the issues between the two of you. Be patient with yourself, you didn't learn how to act independent in a day and it will take some time for you to let someone in like that because you're afraid that it opens you up to hurt. Maybe even talking about your history and how that affects you now will help.

S1LxX6CNaa	Double major curve describes a Scoliosis in which there are two structural curves which are usually of equal size.<br>  <br>  Double thoracic curve a Scoliosis with a structural upper thoracic curve, as well as a larger, more deforming lower thoracic curve, and a relatively nonstructural lumbar curve.<br>  <br>  Who Gets Scoliosis<br>  Scoliosis affects a small percentage of the population, approximately 2 percent. However, scoliosis runs in families. If someone in a family has scoliosis, the likelihood of an incidence is much higher - approximately 20 percent. If anyone in your family has curvature of the spine, you should be examined for scoliosis.<br>  *Children - The vast majority of scoliosis is "idiopathic," meaning its cause is unknown. It usually develops in middle or late childhood, before puberty, and is seen more often in girls than boys. Though scoliosis can occur in children with cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spinal bifida and other miscellaneous conditions, most scoliosis is found in otherwise healthy youngsters.<br>  <br>  *Adults - Scoliosis usually develops during childhood, but it also can occur in adults. Adult scoliosis may represent the progression of a condition that actually began in childhood, and was not diagnosed or treated while the person was still growing. What might have started out as a slight or moderate curve has progressed in the absence of treatment.<br>  <br>  In other instances, adult Scoliosis can be caused by the degenerative changes of the spine. Other spinal deformities such as kyphosis or round back are associated with the common problem of osteoporosis (bone softening) involving the elderly. As more and more people reach old age in the U.S., the incidence of scoliosis and kyphosis is expected to increase.<br>  <br>  If allowed to progress, in severe cases adult scoliosis can lead to chronic severe back pain, deformity, and difficulty in breathing.<br>  <br>  Idiopathic Scoliosis can go unnoticed in a child because it is rarely painful in the formative years. Therefore, parents should watch for the following "tip-offs" to Scoliosis beginning when their child is about 8 years of age:<br>  <br>  Treatment decisions are primarily based on the skeletal maturity of the patient (or rather, how much more growth can be expected) as well as the degree of curvature. The cause of idiopathic scoliosis is unknown (idiopathic literally means "cause unknown"), but the way curves behave is fairly well understood. The younger the patient and the bigger the curve, the more likely the curve is to progress.<br>  <br>  There are essentially three treatment options for adolescents with scoliosis: observation, bracing, and scoliosis surgery. There have been large trials of other forms of treatments, none of which have been shown to be effective. Electrical stimulation, physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation, osteopathic manipulation, or other manual treatments have not been shown to reduce the curvature or to prevent progression.<br>  <br>  Because idiopathic scoliosis is considered a deformity, scoliosis treatment is largely centered on reducing or limiting the progression of the deformity and is not focused on treatment of pain.<br>  <br>  However, having said all that there are many treatments available that are non surgical for Scoliosis.<br>  <br>  When I had my surgery in 1989 there were no other options available as my curve had progressed too far, so I would be interested to hear from anyone that has been down the non surgical road.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Most schools, have at least one exam for all students depending on where you life. Surgery corrects it, the younger you are the easier to recoup. Friends daughter had it never saw signs, family was suprised, surgery was successful and she has no leftover anyting knowing she even went through the proceedure.|`|1dMpQwsCaa	You can either read it hear or copy and paste the link below, where it explains all your answers......from what it is? to, how to detect it?<br>  <br>  <br>  Scoliosis is defined as a lateral curvature of the spine, the presence of which is abnormal. We know that as early as 500 years BC Hippocrates was writing about it, and its name is derived from the Greek word for curvature. It can be disfiguring because when the spine bends to the side, the vertebrae (the individual bones that make up the spine) become twisted and pull the ribs round with them, which sometimes form a "bulge" on the back and cause the shoulder blade to stick out.  <br>  <br>  The causes of scoliosis are many, and although we well understand the consequences, the origins of this condition remain complex and obscure. There are two main types of scoliosis—namely, idiopathic (no known cause) and syndromic (the curvature is part of a recognised disease pattern, such as Marfan's syndrome). Idiopathic scoliosis accounts for most spinal curvatures and they may either be of early onset, before age seven years, or late onset, after that age and usually in adolescence. There is a definite genetic connection, with around 25% of those with a scoliosis have a direct relative with a curvature. 80% of adolescence idiopathic scoliosis arises in girls, and 80% of these girls have their rib prominence on the right side.<br>  <br>  The spine can bend towards either side of the body at any place, in the chest area (thoracic scoliosis), in the lower part of the back (lumbar), or above and below these areas (thoracolumbar). It can even bend twice, causing an S-shaped curve. When the curve is S-shaped (double curvature) it is often not noticeable and the person can appear quite straight because the two curves counteract each other. If the curve is low down in the spine, the ribs will not be affected but one hip may be higher than the other. <br>  <br>  Scoliosis is, surprisingly, quite common. About three or four children per thousand of the general population will need specialist supervision, and about one child in every thousand will need hospital treatment usually for major corrective surgery with the insertion of a (permanent) metal rod, sometimes followed by a period in a plaster jacket or brace. Scoliosis can develop at any time during childhood and adolescence. It might develop in infancy, in which case there is a good chance of it resolving with growth. Progressive (worsening) early onset curvatures are potentially serious, and some of these may need surgical treatment. Late onset scoliosis is less serious, but some will need surgery and all need to be seen by a scoliosis specialist who can keep an eye on the situation and give some idea about the future.  Severe deformity, which is uncommon nowadays because of modern treatment, can lead to damaged lung function, or disability in middle age. The lungs are usually affected only in people with untreated early onset thoracic scoliosis, when the upper (chest) part of the spine is curved.<br>  <br>  A developmental disorder, scoliosis is rarely present at birth. It can develop in infancy or early childhood and it is sometimes caused by rare childhood disorders. However, it is most common in early teenage years, when—especially at the start of the adolescent growth spurt—it can progress rapidly. Treatment at this age is usually corrective surgery. The psychological trauma some teenagers experience can have serious and long lasting effects.<br>  <br>  There is contradictory evidence as to whether early discovery and treatment of a curve improves the long-term outcome, but we know that if curves are discovered too late—when they are already severe—the results of surgery can be compromised. Therefore, awareness of scoliosis and what it can mean for an individual among General Practitioners and physical education teachers in schools is regarded as important, so that early referral to a specialist in scoliosis is achieved. Treatment in a scoliosis centre will usually prevent unsatisfactory long-term results.<br>  <br>  Scoliosis has been recorded since the days of the ancient Greeks, but its cause is still unknown. Orthopaedic surgeons specialising in scoliosis and scientists in many countries continue to research the cause, or causes, of the condition

A9WCbC8aaa	I have been doing the YRG Workout which is a form of Power Yoga like Bikram.  YRG added other exercises like pillates movements and mixed martial arts.  It uses your own body resistance to get you in your fat burning zone and give you a cardio workout.  My back has never felt better.  I tried Bikram but it gets costly and it is hard to do without going to a class.  I do YRG at home and when I travel.

For example are you doing 3 set of 8-10 reps of a weight then increasing the weight to 80kg and then higher?  Are you doing 80kg for 10 or more reps and only one set?  The way you challenge your muscles will have a major impact on how quickly they develop.

3QIWdvG1aa	Strep throat is caused by streptococcal (strep) bacteria. There are many different types of strep bacteria. Some cause more serious illness than others.<br>  <br>  Although some people are quick to think that any painful sore throat is strep, sore throats are usually caused by a viral infection and not strep bacteria. A sore throat caused by a virus can be just as painful as strep throat. But if you have cold symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, or a runny or stuffy nose, you probably do not have strep throat.<br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  The most common symptoms of strep throat are:<br>  <br>      * A sudden, severe sore throat.<br>      * Pain when you swallow.<br>      * Fever over 101°F (38.3°C).<br>      * Swollen tonsils and lymph nodes.<br>      * White or yellow spots on the back of a bright red throat.<br>  <br>  You may also have a headache and belly pain. Less common symptoms are a red skin rash, vomiting, not feeling hungry, and body aches.<br>  <br>  Strep throat can be passed from person to person. When a person who has strep throat breathes, coughs, or sneezes, tiny droplets with the strep bacteria go into the air. These droplets can be breathed in by other people. If you come into contact with strep, it will take 2 to 5 days before you start to have symptoms.<br>  How is strep throat diagnosed?<br>  <br>  Your doctor will do a physical exam, ask you about your symptoms and past health, and do a rapid strep test to diagnose strep throat.<br>  <br>  If the rapid strep test says that you don’t have strep (the test is negative) but your symptoms suggest that you do, your doctor may want to do a throat culture to be sure. This is because rapid strep tests are not always accurate. To do a throat culture, the doctor will swab a sample of cells from the back of your throat. The sample will go into a special cup (culture) where the strep bacteria can grow over time. If strep bacteria grow, the doctor knows that you have strep.<br>  <br>  If the rapid strep test is positive and says that you do have strep, there’s no need to do the throat culture.<br>  How is it treated?<br>  <br>  Strep throat will go away in 3 to 7 days with or without treatment. Doctors usually treat strep throat with antibiotics even though they may not make you well faster. Antibiotics shorten the time you are able to spread the disease to others (are contagious) and lower the risk of spreading the infection to other parts of your body.<br>  <br>  You are contagious while you still have symptoms. Most people stop being contagious 24 to 48 hours after they start antibiotics. If you don’t take antibiotics, you may be contagious for 2 to 3 weeks, even if your symptoms go away.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may also advise you to take an over-the-counter medicine like acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin) to help with pain and lower your fever. Do not give aspirin to anyone younger than 20. It has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a serious illness.<br>  How do you prevent strep throat?<br>  <br>  To avoid getting strep throat, it is a good idea to avoid contact with anyone who has a strep infection. If you are around someone who has strep, wash your hands often. Don’t drink from the same glass or use the same eating utensils, and don’t share toothbrushes.<br>  <br>  Bacteria can live for a short time on doorknobs, water faucets, and other objects. It’s a good idea to wash your hands regularly.<br>  <br>  If you have a strep infection, there are things you can do to avoid spreading it to others. Use tissues you can throw away instead of handkerchiefs, wash your hands often, and do not sneeze or cough on others. Antibiotics can shorten the time that you are contagious. It is a good idea to stay home from work or school until 24 hours after you have started antibiotics.|`|qnjKtXZeaa	hmm...might be the coxakie(sorry not sure how to spell that) virus.

Find something you really love to do, whether it's painting, reading, walking, or something else and it may help your self confidence. Ignore what others say, because honestly, pre-teens and teens are immature with their emotions. The greatest reason for bullying is because the bully is insecure. Just keep telling yourself that you are a better person than those who pick on you, because you are kind and loving.<br>  <br>  If things get really bad, I'm assuming this is happening at school, tell a trusted teacher, principal or your parents. This is bullying and you deserve to feel safe at school.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, things tend to get much better when you're a little older. Find things you love and become the person you want to be.

UgZq1pXjaa	Nope, no extra charges for the bed wetting.  They will probably give you a choice of bed pan or a catheter.  You have to ask to be put in diapers but I can tell you at least for a guy, a diaper is the best choice.  My ex-hubby went in for out patient surgery and he was supposed to pee 30 minutes before, well he did not and on the way to the operating room he said he had to go.  The nurse would not let him go and she said she would "cath" him when he went under and was asleep.  She kept her promise, when he woke up, before he left the hospital, he had to pee in a bottle.  I never heard my ex-hubby swear so much because he said his "thing" burned/hurt a lot when he peed.  The nurse said it was because of the cath and would burn like that for a couple days.

6cOATmACaa	Congratulations!<br>  Lol you are officially a woman or teen, whatever.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I was at school and we had art. Suddenly I really wanted to go to the toilet so I went. So yeah, everything was normal.<br>  But throughout the whole day, I felt wet. I just ignored this but when it came for hometime, I really needed the toilet so badly so I rushed home and ran upstairs. Suddenly to my horror, my knickers were ruined! I panicked, I really didn't know what to do.<br>  I knew I should tell my mum, but I felt really embarressed. So I threw my knickers away and cleaned myself up. From my mums room, I took a pad and wore it. (We were thought this a year before I started, Lool)<br>  <br>  After my dad had gone work I finally plucked up my courage to tell my mum I've started. She was suprised that I  knew what I had to do and said I was very sensible. <br>  <br>  So yeah thats my story. This is my fourth year with my period. Heres some facts , its going to help you;<br>  <br>  <br>  It usually lasts between 3 to 10 days. The first few are always painful but you'll get used to it.<br>  If they hurt the take painkillers and lie on your bed, stretched out. This help and also drink water too. If your perios lasts longer than 10 days, consult your doctor.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps ;)|`|7WbehQZjaa	I had my first period when I was 12 years old. It came on the morning of a dance competition that I was running late for. My mom helped me out with the pad situation and then took me to the competition. She worked after my competition and Dad was home with me. I needed to shower but I didn't know if I was supposed to wear my underwear and pad in the shower so I just started bawling! My Dad was really good about it(Mom hadn't told him yet) and told me to shower normally and then went and got a pad and showed me how to put it in my underwear and made me a cup of hot chocolate and tucked me in. I still laugh(10 years later) about how much I cried over the silliest thing!|`|Xn3wj9LUaa	i slept over at my friends house i was only 10 i went home rly early the night morning. i went to the bathroom and i saw like this brown stuff i had no idea what it was it was just a dot in my underwear so i took themoff showered and went on with my day. i went over another friends house and my mom called me asking if i put a pad on and i said y and she was like you didnt notice you got ur period i said no and then i told my best friend and she went and snuck one of her moms pads for me lol|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	I was 15 and I had been at a party (a wedding or something like that) with my parents.

I went into the bathroom and say that I had started.  For some reason, I did not tell anyone, not even my mom for about 6 months.  I figured it was my business, I did not need to tell anyone.  I think everyone thought I had already started before that anyway.|`|V7mW3KWIaa	only my dad was home because my mom was in mississippi with her family and i started. it was so embarassing to tell my dad about it! theni called my mom and she told my grandma who is asian and my grandma was screaming "AH!

I started at the public swimming pool, at swimteam. We had a break and I didn't start before then but my stomach was killing me. I went to the washroom to find out I had a drop of blood in my bathingsuit. I yelled out to my friend who had already had hers and she told coach that I had a bad stomach and I went home. I think he got the message..lol. It was fine after that. I don't get cramps usually, and my period is still irrigular. My boobs havn't grown any, I didn't gain weight but I do get zits when my period comes.<br>  <br>  Make sure you tell your mom/auntie/older sister/grandma/whoever, have them talk to you.<br>  <br>  tips:<br>  -make sure to pack pads everywhere.. bookbag, coat, luggage, pocket, locker<br>  -tampons are ok when you are relaxed and ready<br>  -your period stops in water, you wear the tampon so when you get out you dont bleed<br>  -change pad 2-4hours, tampons 2-4.<br>  -chocolate is great! so is midol.|`|igIJowa9aa	First, congratulations on officially becoming a woman!<br>  I know this can be very scary and weird at first, but don't worry, you'll get used to it!<br>  When i first started i was luckily at home. I went to the bathroom and surprise!!! there was blood. It really freaked me out at first, but after a few months i started getting used to it.

1tjJPHpMaa	Breakfast: very good. just make sure that you are eating a serving of the cereal and maybe you could try 2% or skim milk<br>  Lunch: bad. you can have the celery but also have maybe a peanut butter sandwich on wheat bread<br>  Snack: you should have a snack. I always eat almonds. they speed up your metabolism. have a handful of unsalted almonds<br>  Dinner: sounds good<br>  Dessert: treat yourself to some sugarfree jello or something. it's only 10 calories and a good reward for the day.<br>  <br>  With your current diet, you will lose a lot more than a pound in one week. That will only be the first week though. The second week, you will probably stop losing weight and by the third, you will be gaining back everything plus more. I know it sounds strange, but you need to eat more in order to effectively lose weight.|`|6UKd0Gedaa	probs more|`|xDSScmkDaa	Youll loose 2 pounds at least a week, with all those exercises and your very low cal diet you will be burning ALOT More than your eating so well done, if you can stick to this.

Rk46lIBwaa	CIN is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia sometimes called carcinoma in situe. <br>  <br>  It is not that clear from your question which cells remain, but I can only assume that they are at a lower level of activity than the CIN3 that has been cauterised.<br>  <br>  The normal practice after colposcopy is to also attend colposcopy clinic follow up. This continues for 3 years, provided that all checks and smears remain normal and then the patient is returned to her GP.<br>  <br>  In your case it does sound as if there are still some issues, I don't however understand the reference to abnormal cells and then to provided your smears remain normal, by definition it appears that they will not be totally normal.<br>  <br>  I think they intend to continue to monitor and if FURTHER cellular change is noted you may need further colposcopic cautery.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Hi. CIN 3 just means there were moderate changes to the cells which have to be removed- as you have had done. Generally the treatment is only needed once and you will be given regular follow up smear tests. As you have had treatment, your cervical cancer risk is very low. <br>  <br>  My understanding was, as long as the cells are all contained within the skin covering the cervix, it is not actual cancer. Actual cancer is defined when the cells break through the top layer of skin covering the cervix and spread to  tissue underneath. When this happens, the cells usually spread and then it becomes actual cancer. Treatment is usually given to remove the cells  if you have carcinoma in situ. When the affected area is removed the problem is solved. I presume this wasn't the case when you had the six month check up? If you still have abnormal cells they generally need to be removed or closely monitored.<br>  <br>  (If you leave this question open I will mention it to Dr Frank.)|`|9OyIL8P9aa	I had the same thing two years ago. <br>  I found out that my cells were abnormal two months after I gave birth to my daughter. I went for check ups and pap smears every six months. The doctor told me that you have to have three "clean" normal pap smear test. If it was of a concern all they will do is remove them.The procedure only takes about 20 minutes top.<br>  I am sure that everything will be fine. <br>  There are so many women that have the same thing. <br>  I hope that this helps coming for someone who has been there and things turned out fine.|`|d6d529942568e28c35ea74a1add8b085aa	My girlfriend has this same issue.<br>  She goes back every 6 months to get it checked however from what she says its nothing to worry about as long as its kept in check.<br>  <br>  More info:<br>  <a href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=2756" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/defaul...</a>|`|w29tsXLUaa	Not to worry.

I had a problem with my ovulation, and bled for 60 days).<br>  I would wait it out, or go to a free pregnancy center. Also, STDs I believe can cause you to miss your period.

If you have acne that bad, switch to a cleanser with peroxide in it, like acne free, you can get it at the drug store. Also, after you shave put on a moisturizer not an after shave, dry skin will make your acne much worse because of the alcohol. Just remember to not use a scrub and find a GOOD cleanser with benzoyl peroxide in it.

It actually originates from previous times when people got married at sixteen and such, where a pregnant seventeen year old girl was expected.  But really, what century is this? Yes, premarital sex happens, but sixteen doesn't have to be when you have to go through with it.<br>  <br>  It's really nothing; personally, I feel that it's just a rumor that goes around, because statistically, not that many teenagers are actually sexually active. A lot of it is just, "Oh, I'm supposed to have had sex, I'll just say I did" and the domino effect causes others to feel that they have to have sex in order to fit in, hence the lies and those who are asinine enough to actually go through with the actual sexual intercourse. Of course, there are also those who believe they are truly "in love" and have sex because of that.. but in any case, the 16 virginity rule is just a misunderstood standard that's been set.

Wait until you are 18 or 19 years old at the very least.  Honestly its  not cool to do it early in life.  If you have fair enough, but i'd just stop now and leave it till you are old enough to appreciate the emotional side of such an encounter.|`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	Its against the law for  a man to have sex with you (or woman if you are a boy) before you are sixteen. They will be put on the sex offenders register, you will be examined by doctors and police and have to make statements and appear in court. You will get the reputation of a slut. Your friends who say you have to loose your virginity before sixteen are quite stupid. its not worth it. They think it makes them grown up to have sex early but those who wait until they find someone who they love end up a lot less screwed up than those who sleep around.|`|VqAw1z6vaa	There is no rule against being a virgin. Guys say that so they can be the one to get you out of your panties. The truth is NOBODY can tell you when to lose your virginity because it is yours, and it is one of the things nobody can take from you unless you give it to them. <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm a virgin and I am 19 ;)|`|PLTsJm8oaa	Okay first of all, do not listen to anyone but yourself! There are a lot of stupid people out there who will lead you in the wrong direction. Personally, I think you are too young to lose your virginity but ultimately it depends on when you feel you are really ready. There is no "rule"!!|`|1UOnrM1Maa	Apparently after 16, if you're still a virgin, then you're a decent person, you'll probably live a long life, you'll get into a good college/job, and you won't have any friends.

If it really bothers you, LIE.|`|ttUnojOjaa	its just one of those high school things lol..<br>  most of my friends, including me, did it before the big 16.<br>  <br>  not necessary though. . i mean its not like writtin in some rule book that its a MUST.|`|e8D6Qvimaa	Well, sexual maturity is only fully attainable if you break the 16 rule.

There is no way to determine exactly when your period will arrive.<br>  <br>  If you're concerned about it, talk to your parents. It'll come eventually.|`|HQ3aNEk5aa	I think you might be starting soon. If you get PMS (Pre-Menstrual-Syndrome) Evening Primrose Oil, gentle exercise, herbal heat packs and baths help a lot. I had it really bad at 10 (believe me, it was terrible!) but these worked a treat.<br>  Yellowy-white discharge is common, so pantyliners are good to stop stains in your knickers.<br>  Its okay! You don't have to worry about not having periods until you are 18, so you have a long way to go. But it may still be hard, as there is an occurrence of teenagers starting 4 years after their friends, and feel really left out. See your friends and talk to them; they will probably try and make it better.<br>  There are several packs to take to school and on holiday, that you can fill with any brand of pad or tampon and are good to get before you actually start. (So you know what to do) There is a planner included, so as soon as you get any white stuff or spotting, plot it down. Remember, the cycle (usually lasting for 21-35 days) can be irregular for years; i.e. you might miss one or two periods inbetween.<br>  <br>  www.pogopack.co.uk (UK)<br>  www.dotgirlproducts.com (US)<br>  Be yourself, and make the best of it.

Instead of taking the placebo, I'll continue with the active pills during my planned cycle, and then have it a week or so later when it's more convenient. I personally would push it off after you see your boyfriend, so that you don't have icky post-period discharge.

l7GjBVvhaa	Almost every woman experiences discomfort during sex at some point in her life. But many suffer in silence for years because they're embarrassed to ask for help or because they've been told it's all in their heads. While sexual pain can be a symptom of stress, depression, or some other psychological problem, there are a number of physical conditions to rule out before heading for the therapist's couch. See if any of the following describes your problem. <br>  <br>  Infection <br>  <br>  Sometimes pain during sex is the first sign of an infection. Vaginal yeast and bacterial infections can reduce lubrication and irritate the opening of the vagina, and will usually be accompanied by itching or an unusual discharge or odor. A urinary tract infection will hurt most when you urinate but can also cause pain during sex because of the pressure on a tender, inflamed bladder. Abdominal pain with intercourse may be a symptom of the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia. Left untreated, chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which causes inflammation and scarring that can make sex unbearable. Once diagnosed, most infections are easily treated with antibiotics or, in the case of yeast, antifungal creams or pills.<br>  <br>  Endometriosis <br>  <br>  About 5 million American women have this painful condition in which tissue from the lining of the uterus grows into areas outside of the uterus such as the vagina or pelvis where it becomes inflamed. More than half of these women report pain with intercourse. Endometriosis can usually be treated with drugs that temporarily suppress estrogen production or surgery to remove the wayward tissue. Birth control pills can also help. Using the woman-on-top position or limiting intercourse to the week or two after you menstruate may also minimize the discomfort.<br>  <br>  <br>  Interstitial Cystitis <br>  <br>  When you feel as if you have a urinary tract infection, but antibiotics won't make it go away, the problem is probably interstitial cystitis. Experts don't know what triggers this condition, in which your bladder becomes chronically inflamed, leading to severe pelvic pain that tends to worsen during sex. Like vulvodynia, this condition is difficult to diagnose and treat. Sufferers may find relief from one of a variety of treatments, such as the drug Elmiron, but no single therapy seems to work for everyone. The woman-on-top position may help you avoid the discomfort that comes with deep penetration. <br>  <br>  Vulvodynia <br>  <br>  If burning pain at the opening of the vagina has made sex impossible but your doctor can't find a cause, you may have vulvodynia, a condition in which part of the vulva is chronically inflamed. No one knows how many women suffer from it or what first sets off the pain, which may be a constant torture or may flare up just during sex. Experimental treatments include cutting certain foods out of your diet or learning to use a biofeedback device to control muscle spasms that may be contributing to the pain. Surgery to remove the inflamed skin has resolved the problem for some women, but should be considered only as a last resort.<br>  <br>  Hormones <br>  <br>  If you're breastfeeding or approaching menopause, your sexual discomfort may be due to hormonal changes. In both cases, falling estrogen levels can dry up your natural lubrication and make your vaginal tissue fragile. New moms may want to use a drugstore lubricant until their estrogen levels return to normal when they stop breastfeeding. Older women with this complaint may consider going on hormone replacement therapy or using an estrogen cream.<br>  <br>  <br>  Doctors are pretty accurate when diagnosing you. I would take what he says serioulsy. You may not know you have chlamydia because the signs and symptoms of pain and fluid discharge. Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. Each year, nearly 3 million people in the United States are infected with chlamydia. The disease affects both men and women and occurs in all age groups, though chlamydia is most prevalent among U.S. teenagers.<br>  <br>  Chlamydia isn't difficult to treat once you know you have it. If it's left untreated, however, chlamydia can lead to more-serious health problems.<br>  <br>  Symptoms<br>  Chlamydia may be difficult to detect because early-stage infections often cause few or no signs and symptoms that might alert you to see your doctor. When signs or symptoms do occur, they usually start one to three weeks after you've been exposed to chlamydia. Even when signs and symptoms do occur, they're often mild and passing, making them easy to overlook.<br>  <br>  Signs and symptoms of chlamydia infection may include:<br>  <br>  Painful urination <br>  Lower abdominal pain <br>  Vaginal discharge in women <br>  Discharge from the penis in men <br>  Painful sexual intercourse in women <br>  Testicular pain in men|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	Sometimes it can be the angle you are at.  Try switching to a different position.|`|7WbehQZjaa	This happens to me as well. Listen to your doctor and get tested for STDs just in case. I have been tested for pretty well all STDs (my doctor has no trust when it comes to STDs) and don't have any. This didn't happen with my ex's but it does with my fiance. It may be the way he's shaped or how big he is, or if this hasn't happened to you before during sex (assuming you've had more than one partner) your body may have changed as well.<br>  <br>  It's best to have the tests done to be sure, and if they are all clean, ask your doctor for advice about this.|`|XoRkPaa1aa	Holy ****. Why... Um... Your doc thinks it's chlamydia but you're not on antibiotics??? You could get PID that makes your "insidy parts" into scar tissue. Scar tissue doesn't work so get your dumbass doctor to get rid of the STD or you won't be having kids. That's what happened to me, I had the pains we got tested and you need to be on meds for like two weeks WITH NO SEX. The longer you go with any bacterial infection the more damage your gonna do... PID sucks you don't get rid of it, it's just a ruined uterus and fallopian tubes. Good luck!|`|Ou3rGsYkaa	I have the same kinda thing! Is it a sort of sharp pain? I know i definately don't have an STI or anything, and I wanna know what it is aswell. The thing is, chlamydia can often not have any symptoms, so get tested if you already havent :) x|`|iWqnGa6gaa	Maybe he is too rough and/or his organ is large.

JLayHNZCaa	Yes, and your Dr can prescribe a after sex antibiotic that you can take one of afterwards to ward it off or you could try excusing yourself to the bathroom and urinating immediately after you have sex to help clear out the urinary tract to see if that helps also.|`|5I7Ifrmraa	Yes you can.

BlMNm9Ccaa	My wife lost around 50 lbs in the first 6 month. It has been 2 years and she has kept it off. She still goes to the meetings a couple of times a month and counts her points for everything she eats, but it has become second nature and she basically has the points memorized for the common items. A little bit of dedication goes a long way. You will also need to start getting some exercise regularly. Good Luck!|`|AA11603468	If you're looking for fast results, WW is probably not for you. In all honesty, the losses are typically slow but consistent. If you figure it took you possibly years to put it on, you will realize it will also take you time to get it off.

It only works when you follow the program fully.|`|wXKs94nDaa	I lost 15 lbs in 2 months, then I slacked off and stopped following it (for last 2 weeks) but I still did not gain anything back.

Restrict all fatty food, sugars, and soda even diet coke (diet coke increases corisol which makes you have belly fat)<br>  <br>  5.

Cut back HOW much you eat. You can still eat your normal food, cut out caffeine drinks. If you start eating smaller portions before lunch have a SNACK like a granola bar, or a piece of fruit and then do the same thing before supper if you get hunger. Start drinking lots of water, you can do home exercising. You can go walking around the block for about 30 mins a day. Start being active. You can also run some too.  I have lost 10 pounds just by cutting out caffeine drinks alone, and watching how much I eat. I haven't gotten to the exercising part yet. But this should really help. But remember you don't have to go to a gym to work out.|`|y3I1qSHEaa	It is fine if you cannot afford a gym.

Cut down on carbs.|`|TEeX06WWaa	i think this is what you are looking for
BlMNm9Ccaa	From what I can recall the main goal is to avoid carbs. Stay away from anything that was once a dough, batter or paste (like breads, cakes, wraps, etc), pretty much all processed food. I think any meat is fair game. Just make sure its not coated in bread crumbs or flour coating. Just remember to not eat to much red meat. When I did atkins the first 3 days were REALLY hard. After that it got pretty easy. Good luck!|`|mlaLgoaSaa	The Atkins Diet is not a smart diet. I suggest you read up on the long and short term effects before starting this diet.|`|AA10895799	Atkins Diet will push up your bad cholesterol.  It's high meat and not so many veggies.  I've eaten that way for years but I am probably a different nationality.  Indigenous people can do it, no one else, and then we die from heart probs and diabetes.  Better read up on that diet, first!!|`|uCxYdyQXaa	Atkins is a low-carb diet, so stay away from foods like bread, pasta, rice, etc.

ybDrwqFbaa	fill it numb your mouth a little and scrape out all the dirty stuff in your tooth then fill it with stuff to keep it from getting worse|`|G4Y96LGqaa	drill and fill|`|3tMGxkRjaa	If your dentist is not describing the depth of the problem optimistically (health professionals often do that so the procedure doesn't seem as threatening), then he/she will usually numb you first by swabbing a fruity-smelling gel called a topical anesthetic in your mouth so you don't feel the next part as much: the needle and syringe which really numbs up the tooth.<br>  <br>  They will then tell you to keep your mouth open wide while they fit you with this thing called a "rubber dam".  This "dam" is a square piece of stretchy latex which they punch a hole into so only the tooth they are working on sticks out, allowing them to work on the tooth without your spit getting in the way.   A bunch of little clamps and a frame are used to hold the piece of rubber in place over your mouth.   They also hang a straw-like suction thing in your mouth to get rid of the extra spit so you don't have to panic about swallowing all the time while this piece of rubber is stretched over your mouth.  You still do have to swallow, because all those fruity smelling things and chewy rubber make you salivate a lot, but I guess it doesn't happen as much, so it works out better for the dentist.<br>  <br>  I hear some dentists occasionally omit the rubber dam part, especially if the filling is very small, easy to reach, and easy to keep dry.   My dentist always uses it, though.<br>  <br>  After you are numb and the tooth is poking through the rubber dam, proudly on display, the dentist will drill a little bit, usually no more than a few seconds if it's a small cavity.   Depending on what you asked for, your dentist will put in either a silver alloy filling (metal colored), or plastic filling (tooth colored).   The plastic ones need to be set or "cured" with an intense UV light for a few seconds, since the stuff is squeezed into the cavity in a semi-liquid or viscous state and will stay that way unless exposed to lots of UV light.   The metal ones set by themselves, so all they have to do is push it into the hole, smooth, maybe even polish it a bit, then ask you not to chew any hard foods for a few hours.|`|Aj1tovPJaa	Inject drill and fill.<br>  <br>  Injection will hurt a bit. Drill sound and smell will be annoying.

ea2aCkB8aa	It's best to see a doctor for professional advice. It could be anaemia.<br>  If you are anaemic, you could suffer dizzy and fainting spells due to the lack of oxygen being transported around your body.<br>  However you also mentioned your ears started to clog and that could also possibly signify an ear infection.<br>  <br>  You get anaemia when you don't have enough red blood cells. This makes it difficult for your blood to carry oxygen, causing unusual tiredness and other symptoms.<br>  <br>  The number of red blood cells can drop if there is:<br>  <br>  a reduction in the number of red blood cells produced<br>  <br>  an increase in the loss of red blood cells. <br>  <br>  Try to eat more foods rich in iron. Also avoid drinking tea with your meals. Some believe that tea actually blocks iron absorption. If you drink tea, drink it between meals. Tannins in tea block iron absorption. Or, add milk to tea. The calcium in milk binds with the tannins. (Herbal tea does not have tannins.) <br>  <br>  I hope it is only an ear infection causing your problems but go check it out to find the accurate reason.<br>  <br>  Take care and try to relax. The doctor's appt is only a day away. Just take it easy in the meantime.|`|CuVnpxh3aa	Your ears don't clog with anemia, I know I have anemia. They will clog with an ear infection, you can get dizzy and/or nauseous and feel like you are going to pass out. I would try sitting as much as possible if you get dizzy standing. You will need antibiotics for an ear infection. Good luck.

It might be a couple of weeks before you notice improvement. Trouble is, when you stop, acne returns. She went on Accutane, a low dose for almost a year, she was very very careful, just a couple of nosebleeds, acne gone, that's 2 yrs ago. I think the side effects may be less on a low dose. But you have to take it longer and absolutely do not get pregnant even for 6 months after.

Numbness is often associated with or preceded by abnormal pain-like sensations often described as pins-and-needles, prickling or burning sensations called paresthesias; see finger paresthesias.

Lastly, yoga and pilates are great ways to relax and tone up at the same time, but can often be challenging.  Check local gyms or at your local university (if you live near one) for gym options.|`|ZxV8FeiYaa	salads without dressing or meat is a great diet (I'm vegan so it's practically all I eat)<br>  <br>  btw I hear a lot of guys like big thies!|`|VrR9ojRRaa	I don't know! But if you find out can you let me know!?! hehe<br>  <br>  I think something like that is genetic and hard to get rid of or change your genetic structure. If you run it will define them, if you diet you will/can lose weight but that will only be compared to the rest of your body (i.e you will lose weight on your thighs, but also your stomach and arms.) which means that compared to the rest of your body, yoiur thighs are still "fat".<br>  <br>  I don't think there is anything you can do to only lose weight in a specific area.

hGF6i3Eyaa	Don't go on the trip while you are sick.You may have the flu instead of a minor cold. Also it could weaken your immune system and cause you to come down with pneumonia.|`|nmvgZWvpaa	Unfortunately, there is no cure for the cold. Just try and load your body with minerals to help your immune system fight the bugs. I would recommend Dayquil and zinc lozenges in the morning, Nyquil at night, and 3,000 mg of Vitamin C with plenty of fluids. <br>  <br>  If the stuffiness gets unbearable, try 30-60mg of sudafed. you have to ask for this one at the pharmacy counter though. Sudafed can make you a bit jumpy though, so use it in moderation.|`|xktBgoKFaa	Chicken soup, zinc tablets and chamomile tea with ginger are effective, according to research.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	There's no cure for the common cold. Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses. Over-the-counter cold preparations won't cure a common cold or make it go away any sooner, and most have side effects. Here's a look at the pros and cons of some common cold remedies.<br>  <br>      * Pain relievers. For fever, sore throat and headache, many people turn to acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or other mild pain relievers. Keep in mind that acetaminophen can cause liver damage, especially if taken frequently or in larger than recommended doses. Be especially careful when giving acetaminophen to children because the dosing guidelines can be confusing. For instance, the infant-drop formulation is much more concentrated than the syrup commonly used in older children. Never give aspirin to children. It has been associated with Reye's syndrome — a rare but potentially fatal illness.<br>      * Decongestant nasal sprays. Adults shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays for more than a few days because prolonged use can cause chronic inflammation of mucous membranes. And children shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays at all. There's little evidence that they work in young children, and they may cause side effects.<br>      * Cough syrups. In winter, nonprescription cough syrups practically fly off the drugstore shelves. But the American College of Chest Physicians strongly discourages the use of these medications because they're not effective at treating the underlying cause of cough due to colds. Some contain ingredients that may alleviate coughing, but the amounts are too small to do much good and may actually be harmful for children. In fact, the college recommends against using OTC cough syrups or cold medicines for anyone younger than age 14. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly recommends against giving OTC cough and cold medicines to children younger than age 2. Meantime, under an agreement announced by manufacturers in late 2008, several brands of OTC cold and cough medications began carrying a warning that these products should not be used in children under 4. For young children, an accidental overdose could be fatal. Coughs associated with a cold usually last less than two to three weeks. If a cough lingers longer than that, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  You may not be able to cure your common cold, but you can make yourself as comfortable as possible. These tips may help:<br>  <br>      * Drink lots of fluids. Water, juice, tea and warm soup are all good choices. They help replace fluids lost during mucus production or fever. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can cause dehydration, and cigarette smoke, which can aggravate your symptoms.<br>      * Try chicken soup. Generations of parents have spooned chicken soup into their sick children. Now scientists have put chicken soup to the test, discovering that it does seem to help relieve cold and flu symptoms in two ways. First, it acts as an anti-inflammatory by inhibiting the movement of neutrophils — immune system cells that help the body's response to inflammation. Second, it temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose, helping relieve congestion and limiting the time viruses are in contact with the nasal lining.<br>      * Get some rest. If possible, stay home from work if you have a fever or a bad cough, or are drowsy from medications. This will give you a chance to rest as well as reduce the chances that you'll infect others. Wear a mask when you have a cold if you live or work with someone with a chronic disease or compromised immune system.<br>      * Adjust your room's temperature and humidity. Keep your room warm, but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air and help ease congestion and coughing. Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.<br>      * Soothe your throat. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day or drinking warm lemon water with honey may help soothe a sore throat and relieve a cough.<br>      * Use saline nasal drops. To help relieve nasal congestion, try saline nasal drops. You can buy these drops over-the-counter, and they're effective, safe and nonirritating, even for children. To use in babies, put several drops into one nostril, then immediately bulb suction that nostril. Repeat the process in the opposite nostril. Doing this before feeding your baby can improve your child's ability to nurse or take a bottle, and before bedtime it may improve sleep.<br>  <br>  Alternative medicine<br>  <br>  Alternative therapies probably won't cure your cold, but they may help make you more comfortable by easing your symptoms.<br>  <br>  Echinacea. Whether taking preparations of the herb echinacea protects you from getting a cold or relieves cold symptoms continues to be debated. While no studies have shown that taking echinacea can prevent you from getting a cold, there is some evidence that it can modestly relieve cold symptoms or shorten the duration of a cold. E

FF5AeHvqaa	Erm... firstly, Please ignore that link which has just been posted!!!<br>  <br>  You don't say how tall you are which makes all the difference to your whether you weigh more than you should, but from the sounds of it I cant imagine that you have anything to worry about! You are still growing, so wont fit your clothes forever!!! (sad I know when you have favourites!!)<br>  <br>  As you get older you will become more curvy, so what you see as 'chunky' surely isn't! All women are wider at their hips!<br>  <br>  It sounds like, at your age and weight, you really don't need to be dieting. When I was about that age I was so scared that I was getting too big and got so preoccupied with it I found myself obsessing over it and wound up very upset. I wasted so much time on this I missed out on so much!<br>  <br>  The best advice I can offer is that you should spend more time doing 'stuff'. Walking is an excellent exercise and will make you feel better. even if its only walking with your friends round the shops!!! Or join a sports team, or do some volunteer work that involves being out and about, like tidying up a local park!!!<br>  <br>  Anyways.. I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Please don't worry about you weight as your sound ABSOLUTELY FINE!!!<br>  <br>  =^..^=|`|MKWrLkH8aa	You'd have to be really short for 7 stone 11 pounds to be too much.

046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	A person who carries the CF gene will not have any problems themselves. The only effect it has on their children is if they have a child with someone who is also a CF carrier or has CF.<br>  <br>  The father should be tested to find out if he is a carrier or not. A child can only be born with CF if both parents are carriers or have CF themselves and both pass the faulty gene on to the child. If the father doesn't carry the CF mutation then the baby should be fine. If he does then the parents will then be offered an amniocentesis, where they take a sample of the baby's placental fluids, to check if they have CF or not.|`|3YJe5Z4Faa	Cystic fibrosis is what is called an "autosomal recessive" disease.  This means that for your niece's daughter to have CF, Dad would also have to be a carrier for CF OR have CF himself.<br>  If Dad is neither a carrier nor a victim of CF, there is a possibility for the child to be a carrier of CF but this will not harm the child and it will not be an issue until it comes time for the child to have kids of his/her own.
5ea96a0d3c1c3138f6fed57f36d8dd76aa	Before going to the doctor I suggest that you try looking at other foods, like the Activia yogurt from Dannon, that would help you digest your food better.

9EVcTnUWaa	You should ask your doctors if a simple saline solution would work for you. The one that I use when my daughter is stuffy is one teaspoon of salt in a quart of warm water.

5TM9P8tsaa	*Try Zycam (not sure of spelling). It has worked pretty good on my daughter.

wqL84O8Naa	its a disease of the mind, it comes from being obsessed with your weight to the point that you're never satisfied. Its treatable and you should seek real counseling because it can truly kill you if it gets out of hand.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	It took me quite a while to realize that I had body dis-morphia as a teen. What I realized was that I was looking in the mirror and always seeing my flaws, and using these to draw the conclusion that I was fat. I knew that I was the same size as my friend who I always saw as really thin, but I always saw myself as being huge compared to her. I recently looked at photo albums of myself at that age, and instead of seeing a fat person, I finally saw what I was. My cheeks were sunken, I had bones popping out everywhere, and my thighs were thinner than my arms are today. It is really difficult to recognize body dis-morphia if you have an eating disorder. It is because you see what you want to see in order to justify your eating disorder.  The only way to really see it is to get help with your eating disorder, which it appears as though you are trying to do.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	it's psychological and you need to see a therapist to understand it.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	Its a part of the hormone thing. You eventually grow out of it. Sometimes you don't but you probably will in your 20's when you don't care as much about what you look like. Just remember that you're beautiful no matter what size :) Eating disorders will hurt your future not only in relationships but also in potential jobs if you're ever sent to a therapist or a rehab. Just eat healthy and exercise and you'll be ok :)|`|WL7nKDplaa	I have a really similar problem, except I don't have an eating disorder and I'm not in therapy. But I understand what it is.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Just keep going to therapy. You'll be fine.|`|i4DhPvjFaa	I know what you mean. It changes so slowly yet so quickly that you don't even realize whats happening. Its not like you go to bed happy and wake up the next morning hating what you see in the mirror.

Sometimes that is better to take and causes less gastrointestinal disturbances.

bBWHrEciaa	If you've never done it before, it's very tricky, especially down there. The first time you wax down there, it's the most painful time you'll do it. I highly recommend going to a salon with a trained professional. You could accidentally remove skin and cause scarring and painful burns where you removed too much.
t81MEJ82aa	I don't know what bulking up means in your mind but women generally cannot be bulky. Weights are your friend, and many women assume that they are going to look like a WWE wrestler if there go near a weight. I cannot stress to you enough that weight training will have you burn far more calories than cardio alone. Also, how you do you plan on getting toned without weight training?<br>  <br>  There are other ways to work your butt without doing squats. You can google a variety of exercises and many of which won't put much stress on your knees. I think you should listen to the person at Ballys. They are there for a reason. <br>  <br>  How long it takes depends on you, about 2 months if the diet and exercise regimen and habits are good. Getting plenty of water and a proper diet are essential as well.|`|BlMNm9Ccaa	My wife and I are doing the Julian Michael's (Biggest Loser) 30 Day Shred DVD workout. It promises 20 lbs in 30 days.

Okay, here's my thoughts on flying and/or traveling and simply any and ALL the time... it's an absolute MUST that get yourself a letter from your endocrinologist stating that your a type 1 (or type 2) diabetic, insulin dependent; this will help you along the way.  Also it will clarify all things when driving.. such as in the case of low blood sugars (or high).  Mistakes have been made by officials - from the point of view of drunk driving or other offensive allegations, they can arrest a diabetic for combativeness, resisting arrest.. and so forth because they just don't know....  Whether you're in an amusement park or on the job, or whatever, you really really have got to get AND  wear a MedAlert type bracelet stating your medical conditions - officials can't tell that your low or high BS'd unless they know to test you.  Hope this helps.  Debbie.|`|rVvtoljyaa	I just put mine in a clear bag along with my other meds and let the screener know and I've had no problems. They tell me that they see it all the time. I sometimes get visual checks and other times don't. Its no big deal. It's good your checking ahead, I did the same and felt Much better about it before I traveled the 1st time. Have a great trip!|`|t36Dce0Laa	Show them your diabetic info. Tell them you need the pump/insulin and have a doctors note with the diabetic supplies.|`|DDuLoMWxaa	my mum has diabetes and she jus takes her insulin wiv her. she jus puts it in a toiletery bag and if any1 asks wot it is u can just say ur diabetic.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	As much as possible, keep your supplies in their original packaging with the prescription label if possible.  Also have your doc fax or send you a letter to carry with you that says you are a Type 1 diabetic and will be carrying a variety of supplies with you including insulin, syringes, lancets, etc.  Your doc should already have a basic letter done up already.  That will get you through free and clear.  Also, if you happen to wear a pump, don't let them make you take it off and put it on the x-ray machine, it can damage it.  Wear the pump and go through the detector gate as normal.  They should know this but once in a while you'll get someone who's not aware.|`|BDnSmRE6aa	I have an insulin pump and was told by my nurse that it would be advisable to have a letter from the doctor explaining the reason for needles and any other supplies I would need to take.
f0dnVAW7aa	I had my braces only a few years ago. They offered me either type.. but as someone said before me, they only allowed the top to be clear. I wanted the normal metal braces. <br>  <br>  I found that the normal braces were smaller than the clear ones.. and the clear are not all that clear. You still have a metal strip across them and then the elastics.. unless you get clear elastics too - but what's the fun in that?<br>  <br>  So I had metal braces..<br>  <br>  I'm not really able to compare them as I only had the metal ones.. but my friend did have the clear on top and metal on the bottom and they didn't look that great.. her mouth looked like it was much more crowded than mine :)<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting all metal. They just seem better to me. I don't think they would break as easily being metal and all. <br>  <br>  A few things I would like to recommend you make sure you do though is BRUSH AND FLOSS!! I cannot express how badly I wish I had taken what the orthodontist told me. I have these little calcium white spots on my teeth just outlining where the braces were. My husband says you can't even notice them but just that I know they are there bothers me. I tried using white strips but they didn't do all that much. I am told they will fad with time, but why should you have to go thru all the extra trouble, right :)<br>  <br>  Another word of advice is be careful what you eat. I remember right off the bat I was going to be eating exactly what was on the list and do everything right.. but one piece of popcorn lead to lots more and countless nights of picking it out of my braces. Also be aware of the hard and chewy things you eat - brackets can break easily.. not a big deal, you just have to go back to the orthodontist and he/she will tighten them again after cementing it back on your tooth - just more work. <br>  <br>  No, you do get the same amount of brackets.. one for every tooth except your very last molar. <br>  <br>  Um.. what else can I think of. <br>  <br>  Be careful when you're kissing :)  [heehee]<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!|`|3fw3qFERaa	1. Normal metal braces (brackets) are stronger than the clear<br>  2. You do not get less brackets with clear<br>  <br>  I have braces and am so thankful that they offer the clear!  Now I was told when mine were put on that you could only get clear on top.  Another thing to consider is clear tends to be more expensive but not much more.<br>  <br>  This link has pictures and descriptions of each of the different types:<br>  <a href="http://sarverortho.com/Treatment/TypesofBraces/tabid/106/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://sarverortho.com/Treatment/Typesof...</a>|`|DxD6OkKuaa	the clear braces are clear an the the normal arnt ;)|`|yVAgl3zJaa	i'm not sure about the strengh differences but i'm guessing their around the same. i would deffinately get the clear bause when people are far away you can't even tell you have braces on, the only negitive thing is if people are close your teeth sometimes look weird.

9x4fssPuaa	It's annoying for girls, yes. However, boys in high school are just understanding what girls are - instead of thinking you have cooties like they did in elementary, they are thinking you are goddesses. Boys will even out later on and realize that gawking is insulting. <br>  <br>  What helps: Don't get mad, in a sense you have some power over them, so be confident. And don't be embarrassed. If any of those boys are a friend of yours or you chat with you can say something to redirect him if you have to "take a picture it will last you longer." <br>  <br>  Note: Set limits when you have to. If they insult you or grab you, there are rules and laws against that. Report if you have to that's a way of standing up for yourself and teaching them how to function in the real world.|`|AA11227341	Hey K. its a dirty mind that is working there, they are just hoping to see something (use  your imagination) and no matter what girls were--pants or an iron suit they will still try to get a pick at the girls in hopes of seeing something that they can remember seeing.  Sorry but guys are 99.99  percent horny all the time not that they would have see there but the mind is dirty.

XyIOD5Olaa	If it will go away with time might depend on your body chemistry and hormones.<br>  <br>  Shaving is not usually recommended for facial hair that you want to to get rid of permanently.  The stubble that results could make it more noticeable and, as you point it, it could grow back thicker in time.<br>  <br>  Waxing could be an option because it is a widely-held belief that the hair will become finer and less noticeable with waxing and that, eventually, hair will stop growing from those follicles.<br>  <br>  My most sincere advice, however, is to try to remember that anyone else in your life who matters does not care if you have hair on your cheekbones.  And letting it annoy you that much is more effort than cheekbone-hair deserves!!  Does it really make sense to spend so much energy on such an insignificant thing?  Answer that truthfully and you might find the real answer to your question...  you should stop letting it annoy you.|`|Uihh8Cqqaa	Waxing it won't make it go away either. Just shave, there's no harm in shaving. <br>  Edit: The growing back thicker thing is a myth, when it grows back it feels thicker because the hair coming out actually is due to the fact that you are no longer feeling the worn out tip.|`|g6eToQMpaa	wow cool hair. <br>  and err wax it ? because then it will take a month for it to grow back.|`|ca9d8fe1a1caa740320f4a00800a07d4aa	Perhaps they are extended eyebrows !!!!!!!!!!|`|7f9M7kyYaa	try plucking it, you will have to pluck it only every 2 weeks or so,|`|s8SSpUpjaa	I had the same thing and it kept getting, worse wax it NOW!!!|`|Ig3W5YZnaa	shave it unless u wanna look like an ape|`|taNfM0yLaa	idk do what u think is best 4 u|`|ywer453paa	Waxing it might make it worse, and it'll make your skin red and irritated for a while.

Eyeglass prescriptions are for corrective lenses which rectify sight abnormalities at the time an examination is performed. Sight can change over time, and therefore another examination might need to be performed to determine if the prescription requires modification (this would typically be if a year or more has lapsed between examinations).
pJulCn00aa	I think you are jumping to conclusions here about liver/kidney failure if you don't know where they are located? But anyway, i'll educate you.<br>  <br>  You're kidneys (you have two) they are located pretty much in your lower back. Sometimes if you have to urinate, u will find ur lower back will hurt. <br>  <br>  Signs of kidney failure: Tired, shortness of breath, decreased urine output (less pee), low calcium, high potassium levels--which can lead to deadly cardiac arrhythmias. loss of appetite, which obviously will lead to decreased mental status, n possibly coma.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your liver is located under your right rib cage. STOP --- DO NOT POKE IT. Some people can palpate their liver, I do NOT recommend this. <br>  <br>  Signs of liver failure can be difficult to diagnose at first (unless ur jaundice which is yellowing of the skin). At first the person can be nauseaus, tired, no appetite, & have diarrhea. As liver failure progresses other more obvious signs are jaundice, swollen abdomen(ascites), bleeding easily, mental disorientation or confusion, sleepy, possibly a coma.

AVDAKbnvaa	Blushing and embarrassment go hand in hand. Feeling flushed is such a natural response to sudden self-consciousness that if it weren't part of an emotionally crippling experience, it could almost be overlooked. But blushing is unique, which is why scientists want to know more about blushing. While the psychology of blushing remains elusive, we do understand the physical process involved. Here's how it works. <br>  <br>  Blushing from embarrassment is governed by the same system that activates your fight-or-flight response: the sympathetic nervous system. This system is involuntary, meaning you don't actually have to think to carry out the processes. In contrast, moving your arm is a voluntary action; You have to think about it, no matter how fleeting the thought is. This is good, because if moving your arm was involuntary, people would end up buying a lot of stuff they don't want at auctions.<br>  <br>  When you're embarrassed, your body releases adrenaline. This hormone acts as a natural stimulant and has an array of effects on your body that are all part of the fight-or-flight response. Adrenaline speeds up your breathing and heart rate to prepare you to run from danger. It causes your pupils to grow bigger to allow you to take in as much visual information as possible. It slows down your digestive process so that the energy can be redirected to your muscles. All of these effects account for the jolt you feel when you find yourself embarrassed.<br>  <br>  Adrenaline also causes your blood vessels to dilate (called vasodilation), in order to improve blood flow and oxygen delivery. This is the case with blushing. The veins in your face respond to a signal from the chemical transmitter adenylyl cyclase, which tells the veins to allow the adrenaline to do its magic. As a result, the veins in your face dilate, allowing more blood to flow through them than usual, creating the reddened appearance that tells others you're embarrassed. In other words, adrenaline causes more local blood flow in your cheeks.

AA10719818	I'm not sure about how they work, but i completely understand what you mean!<br>  I've heard alot of horror stories about people having to wait for months to be treated for their illnesses in Canada.  If we could get around that hurdle, i think we could make it work here.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Why don't you ask all those Canadian and European doctors who are leaving the countries because they can't make enough money to pay for their schooling!<br>  <br>  Socialized medicine does NOT get rid of insurance companies -- it only reduces them to one or two REALLY POWERFUL giants.  The situation is Canada and Europe are MUCH worse than in the US, with people dying because the state-run insurance companies will not pay for the proper medications and treatments.<br>  <br>  As well, the state-run insurance companies also puts severe limits on what medicines they will pay for, and how much.  Many major drug manufacturers are reducing or eliminating their presence in Canada and Europe.  thus, the Canadian and Europeans have fewer and lower-quality drugs to choose from.<br>  <br>  AND -- this is one reason why you shouldn't buy Canadian drugs over th internet.  There is NOT the high level of control in Canada that we see in the US.  Many Canadian drugs are low quality. Many do not even contain the medicine that they claim to contain, and some even contain materials that are poisonous.  this is because the drugs are not made in Canada!  they are often made in the Pacific Rim countries, with FAR less quality control.<br>  <br>  You think you have problems now -- wait until we get socialized medicine.  You will get poor treatment, extremely long waits at the hospital, and ineffective drugs.|`|Zb7H4B3Xaa	I don't know if it would work, but I do feel the same as you do.  It's like they find every little thing in the book that justifies them not covering your medical expenses.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	I sure hope not! I have friends in both the UK and Canada that say that the "wonderful" socialized medicine is anything but wonderful. My friend, Dave, in Canada, his mother was told she would have to wait 7 months, after being diagnosed with cancer, to start treatment. His parents sold their house, sold their business, came to the US, and paid for treatment and surgery. By the time the 7 months had passed, she already had surgery to remove what they could of the tumor, and was already doing chemo for 3 months.

22bd9613eedea26987eff70fd9d04b95aa	The first 2 answers are good advice.  To add to it:<br>  <br>  1.  You can readjust by staying up past the first night until the second night.<br>  <br>  2.  You can not eat or drink anything with stimulants in it like coffee for 1 hr before sleep.<br>  <br>  3.  A trick I like is 30 min before sleep I mentally review all I projects and things I need to get done and then I say to myself that there is no more I can do about it now so I will not worry about it until tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Remember that sleep is necessary for many reasons such as letting your body heal and letting your mind file away necessary thoughts.<br>  <br>  Also, remember you cant make up sleep.  If you only get 3 hrs one night, you will not make it up by sleeping 10 the next.  Just sleep your normal 7-8.<br>  <br>  Also remember everyone is different.  Some people need 9 hrs others need 6.  This number changes as you get older.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|sPT8ikgXaa	I'm currently in the same situation...I go to bed about 5am and sleep until 1pm.  Next month when I start a new job, I will need to get back into the old routine of going to bed early so I can be up early for work.  Here is what I do: I force myself to go to bed at 11pm...by taking a sleeping pill and reading.  Then when I wake up, I'm very tired, but I force myself to stay up all day (no naps) until its 11pm again...and after just doing this for 1 day, my body adjusts.  When you can get yourself tired and go to bed sooner, you will sleep through the night and get up earlier.  I'm a night person, so doing this is not easy, but it works.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Well enjoying staying up late will not help you get to sleep any earlier. First get all your stuff done so you really have nothing to do. Avoid caffeine or nicotine or any other upper before bed. Read a book in bed or lay down to watch TV

You will need like string or floss.. (ha ha) and a big sharp needle. Then you will have to sew it on. But it may lead to death because you won't be able to handle the pain and people come to the doctor from foreign countries and they don't have to pay. That's why we have taxes. Just tell the doctor that you can't afford it. He can't just let you be without medical attention. And why did you cut your arm off in the first place?|`|oiNkygNtaa	why try to put it back on its not like your ever going to be able to use it again just turn on one of burners on the stove wait for it to get really hot and stick whats left of your arm on it and keep it on there for a few minutes (this will stop the bleeding and keep it from getting infected to badly as long put burn cream and alcohol on it a few times a day)

bQTWX32taa	Because you are not comfortable taking a crap in a bathroom stall or someone elses house  where u think ppl will laugh if u make farting noises or it stinks too much you worry.. Your self conscious and embarrassed  as is most people when taking a dump somewhere your not comfortable.  <br>    So all of that makes it hard to get your body to relax enough to let it go..

86VgnUmQaa	Make comforting foods. Whenever I am sick to my stomach, generally I don't eat, but there are certain things that I can manage to choke down.. Like tea, water, instant oatmeal, and Saltine crackers.<br>  <br>  If you can drive or walk to a store, buy some popsicles and watch T.V. or pick out a movie. These things can be soothing, and generally take your mind off of being sick.<br>  <br>  It's really important that you drink liquids, since you are fighting a virus and is losing lots of body fluid going to the bathroom and everything. Don't force yourself to drink, but if you feel you absolutely cannot drink at all, try to drink a tablespoon of water once every 30 minutes. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you, and I hope you get better.|`|J05WTQwPaa	You're not dehydrated.

kLSSLlOaaa	Its just your muscles being overloaded. if its in your stomach area, those are your stabilizer muscles. They just arent used to stabilizing the body in those different positions. Over time they will build and be able to stabilize for longer periods of time. Its a sign of progress. not a bad thing|`|xlSVS0u6aa	I would say that your muscles are pulling or its just a twitch my leg does it sometimes its not a thing to worry about just try to hit the gym and work on them or crunches if they work for you and you should be fine.
mFQnLtovaa	i know you probably dont feel like it but exercising will help a ton! just got for a walk, swim, some step aerobics, anything to get yourself moving a bit. Take a hot bath and give yourself plenty of time to soak and relax. Use a heating pad and some midol or lots of ibuprofen. Try not to stress while you are on your period cause it makes you feel so much worse. I dont know how old you are but i just turned 17 and last june i went on the pill b/c of my cramps and heavy periods. i hardly cramp at all now. so that could be an option.

Just take care of taking too little food, just the right amount needed for your diet, that's why it'd be much better if you consult a specialist!

CfQ1WAXLaa	I walk with a cane and the usual way is to do the opposite side from the injury, but I found that when the injury first happened, I used the cane on the injured side, because I was afraid that my knee would fail and I would fall.  However she feels the most secure.  Be sure she shrugs her shoulder often during the day for exercise, becsuse you put extra strain on the joint.  Best wishes for a speedy recovery.|`|AA11057741	I was in this same predicament a week ago!  I'd call a dr or even a pharmacy will know.  I immediately thought to use my crutch on the side of the injury, but was told by my mother that it's the other way around....I'd check on it.|`|jCLPEgKYaa	People usually use canes one the same side as the injury in order to use the cane instead of the injured leg.

Not cut down. Quit.
4TDJeyFGaa	polyps are outgrowths, they can be anywhere in the digestive system. When you eat, the food rubs against them and irritates them. I am guessing you will have to have it removed because they can potentially become cancerous. To get your throat cleared up i would eat things that aren't too solid. like soup and yogurts so that it can clear up and not be anymore irritated, which then the doctor can remove it or treat it.|`|eh8ZEWd1aa	Did he check your thyroid - When my thyroid swell I have difficult swallowing.

BG8vMyZjaa	Caues of body odour<br>  ody odour is produced when the bacteria, which normally grows on skin, decomposes sweat. Human skin produces two kinds of sweat, the cooling watery liquid produced by the eccrine glands and the milky secretion of the apocrine glands. We have two or three million eccrine glands covering our body, and eccrine sweating starts from birth. The skins of infants are covered with apocrine glands - this is why babies have such a distinctive smell. Most of these glands stop working several months after birth, however, and remain shut down until the onset of puberty, at about eight years old for girls and nine years old for boys, when stimulated by the hormone testosterone. In adults, apocrine sweat glands number a mere 2000 or so and are concentrated in the groin and armpits, although there are also some on the scalp and elsewhere. Apocrine secretion is stimulated by hormones and also by fear and stress. Stress sweating occurs mainly in the underarm areas, feet and palms (this phenomenon is exploited in lie detection).<br>  <br>  It's the apocrine secretion that causes the odour problem. Certain anaerobic bacteria (corynebacteria and micrococci) feed on this stuff and produce the pungent odour we have been taught to fear in ourselves and abhor in others for its social consequences.<br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A929801" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A929801</a><br>  <br>  Causes of halitosis<br>  The most common causes of occasional halitosis include smoking cigarettes or cigars, drinking alcohol or eating certain foods.<br>  Culprits that are often to blame include onions, garlic, curries, cured foods like salami and cooked foods like kippers.<br>  There are other causes, see<br>  <a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/hilaryjones/embarrassingprobs/badbreath.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/hilaryjones/e...</a><br>  <br>  I don't think water is the cause unless it is dirty polluted water|`|5ith7Qyoaa	if its not filtered the same as your body is used to, then most likely its the water causing the problem|`|krCAJuZiaa	The water could very well have something to do with it...
Ow6lKFXiaa	1. Yes, she did the right thing in defending.<br>  <br>  2. My answer would be the same.<br>  <br>  3.  I wouldn't have gone that far. I would have slapped him really, really hard, and made a big scene to ensure that everyone knew what he did to shame the hell out of him, let other girls know to beware, and so he could be shunned by the majority who would now know what a..."jerk"...he was.<br>  <br>  4. Yes, I've been groped, and did just as described in #3. It works quite well. The guy hates you for embarrassing him but doesn't dare do or say anything because he knows everyone is now watching him.<br>  <br>  5. Yes, I feel very bad for him. What he did was wrong but in no way deserved such a devastating punishment. I mean, 14-year-old boys do stupid things, as do 14-year-old girls. They are both immature, hormone machines. If he was an adult, well, then I'd think he was a real pervert and deserved to be put out of action. But a young, stupid boy? In couple of years, he'd probably have matured and be in disbelief that he could do something so dumb and insulting.<br>  <br>  6. If it was my daughter, I'd be horrified. I don't think your sister meant to do the amount of damage that resulted. What truly horrifies is that she shows no remorse for what she did to him whatsoever. Any "normal" person would say "yeah, he was wrong and my reaction was instinct, but OMG, what did I do? She has definite emotional issues and, unless she sorts them out, will someday be in the newspapers for murdering someone who pissed her off...boyfriend, husband, annoying toddler. <br>  <br>  7. If this was my son, I would in no way, complain about the suspension. Heck, he deserved it. I'd have a very serious talk with him, ensure he apologized to your sister, and if I even suspected he did something similar again, he would get some serious professional counseling.<br>  <br>  I have to say this, despite all the thumbs down I'll get, and since I'm going to get them anyway for not agreeing with everyone else here...what the hey.  I find it unbelievable that the boy's mother would truly take this so calmly. Her child is mutilated permanently and the hospital bills must be enormous. Also, the fact that your parents are not horrified at the violence and lack of remorse shown by your sister and that you agree "that she should not be held responsible for injuries he suffered". I must congratulate your parents on raising such humane, compassionate children, you’re such a wonderful contribution to society. I also have to wonder if you've left information out or if this never really happened, it's actually a psychology assignment and we're assisting your research. I'm sorry, but something’s just not right here.<br>  <br>  Edit: I see you extended the time for this post. If this had really happened you would have felt vindicated by the 11 posts agreeing w/you and gone on w/your life. That you were not satisfied and need more answers is suspect. Sorry to be such a B****, but...|`|fC8OPOTkaa	she was so not right to do that. i believe that you should only hit a guy down there if he is trying to rape or attack you. she could have slapped him or something. in my opinion 1 week isn't long enough and i hope this guy recovers from this easily.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	i felt his pain while reading......OMG! <br>  <br>  But u cant touch someone like that, and at 14 ne knows whats right and whats not.

I probably would have done the same thing.. maybe not so hard.. and i probably wouldn't have yelled at him.<br>  4.nope <br>  5. Maybe not quite. i mean, he deserved to be kicked in the balls but the fact that they ruptured and he'll never have kids is sorta sad... it was his fault though..<br>  6. I would feel like she had a right to defend herself<br>  7. I would feel bad for him, but angry that he did that to her.<br>  hope this helps!|`|c2uywBsIaa	I think that he got what he deserved minus the permanate dmg. I'm sure your sister didn't think that she would hurt him that bad but i do not blame her for her reaction. If it were my daughter I would not punish her. I would tell her to do it again if she were ever in that situation knowing me. If it were my boy I would tell him that he was wrong for what he did and ask why he would expect any other reaction to grabbing someone in the manner that he did. I would be dissapointed in him but I think that I may be sympathetic to him being hurt. Any parent would be, just because he was being a perv doesn't stop him from being your baby.|`|sIv9gaolaa	I think she was right to defend herself, yes, but maybe not so violently. She musta kicked him pretty hard to rupture his testicles and leave him infertile. I would have retaliated as well but probably by slapping his face or something like that. I do feel bad for the guy, he is never going to be able to have kids just for giving a girl a flirty squeeze on the bum. If it was my daughter, I probably would feel the same way. If it was my son, I'd probably be really angry and upset.|`|tlgJrKoRaa	Good on her, way too go.  I would have done the same thing. My answer to question 1 would be the same regardless of whether he was injured or not.  You dont have to put up with that.  I dont feel bad for the boy he asked for it.  If it were my daughter i would be proud she stuck up for herself and if it was my son i would have given him a damn good telling off if not a slap.<br>  <br>  It could well have been an adult assaulting her<br>  <br>  Well done your sister|`|f6igTsNjaa	I think Amy did the right thing!|`|1CTbPfbqaa	1.

No I don't if it had been a woman who touched a man and then they caused permanentnt damage to the woman he would definitely be in jail.<br>  6. Get very angry and probably slap her<br>  7.

No, that's a stupid, uncalled-for thing to do to a male. That should be the last resort if he is trying to RAPE or KILL you. <br>  2. Uh, no. <br>  3. Probably slapped him, or kicked his shin. <br>  4. Yeah, I kicked their shin. <br>  5. Yes, I do. He was disrespectful, true, but what your sister did was cruel. <br>  6. Hope to anything that the boy's parents didn't press charges. And punish her severely. She deserves it. <br>  7. I would in fact press charges. The law is unfair enough in this regard as it is.|`|tADSxyqwaa	I was raped at 18 and wish i had your sister's courage.  Sadly it usually takes something terrible to happen before girls can stand up for themselves.<br>  As regards your sister's case - she totally should have the right to defend herself.  That boy committed a Serious Sexual Assault. Had he done it 10 years later in a place of work then he would have been fired/sued and still had his balls kicked in!  Perhaps your sister went a bit far and the school is responding more to the boy's injuries than her actions.  I cannot stress strongly enough though that she did the right thing and should do it again if it happens again.  Its better to overreact and be safe than let the pervert getr away with it.  Who knew, next time it could have been a shyer, more scared person who would let that sexual asault ruin her mental well being. If he had not assaulted her she would not have reacted at all, let alone with that level of force<br>  <br>  PLUS lets be honest, if the school can get amy to accept some of the blame by taking the punishment then Amy cant sue for the school not providing her a safe and nurturing environment.  And lets be honest, how many schools would want the headline "school fails to protect against Sexual Assaults"
AA12225723	Completely normal, humans are hairy.|`|nG9znIxYaa	totally normal. if they really bother you then you can get bleach for body hair in the chemist to make them lighter in colour so they are less noticeable.|`|HBx6q05Oaa	Yes, hair acts as a lubricant so our clothes dont rub our skin raw, and a protector trapping germs. This little bit of hair is great so dont mess with it!|`|7hfbQTxjaa	I don't think it's anything to worry about, though you might want to shave/wax.|`|ca6pFETbaa	as long as you dont have hairy nipples.... i knew a girl who had hairy nipples.... i never talked to her again.....
V0DcrdOUaa	We're women. Our bodies and our cycles are not "disgusting," "gross" or anything to be embarrassed about. <br>  <br>  I couldn't use a tampon until after I had had sex, because when I tried it would hurt. Afterward, I realized it was for no other reason than the fact that I really didn't understand my own body. So if it is really important to you, you can get a doc to show you exactly where it fits otherwise you can forget it for awhile. <br>  <br>  Pads will be fine alone. You can wear 2 at once and/or change pads more frequently. Don't worry too much. If you are still a teen, chances are that your cycle is still going through a lot of changes. And if you are an adult, you could think about seeing a doc for hormones (birth control pill) that will make your period easier to manage.|`|hZWup7xXaa	you may be putting it in the wrong place. i know how gross this sounds but use your finger and feel around down there, your finger should sort of slide into your vagina. or you can use a mirror and have a look down there, you will find a hole, not your bum. the hole may be a little hard to see so feel around and look and you should find it. i have never heard of being to narrow to use tampons, they do break you hymen, but they may not. anyways once you find your vagina get in a comfortable position, you can squat, put one foot up on the toilet, or some girls even have to lay down to put them in. if you need more help you can im or email me on here hun. hope this helps :)|`|4wINNSSeaa	you could use a tampon and a pad at the same time|`|m3cf7vsAaa	If your bleeding has increased dramatically and or the pain has worsened you need to go to the Dr. and make sure you're ok.  Also you can try slender tampons, and the extra light flow ones.  By tampax theyre purple.  Make sure you read the pamphlet in the box and no, you cant put it in the wrong place, its more likely that you aren't positioning it comfortably.  If you are successful in positioning it, it may still feel like you have to pee.  Welcome to the joys of womanhood honey!  Best of luck!  Also there is a product called "Instead" and they are little soft cups (almost like a diaphram) that you insert and they hold blood.  Available at walgreens in the tampon section.|`|inA6ZLeAaa	Try using kotex security they are softer to insert, maybe put a little lube on the first couple of times too,,|`|ZfMo4ccraa	<a href="http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/tampon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/tampon....</a><br>  Maybe reading this will help?|`|858a0632fe3d77a7fe9bf558aaa8a346aa	Try angling it more towards your back when you insert it.  Are you a virgin?  If so, you may have a hymen that has too narrow an opening.  Tampons won't break your hymen so don't worry about that... Some women just can't use them.|`|FlsTnEA5aa	Listen. PLEASE! <br>  Take my Advice! Tell you Mother, Friend (girls only!) or sisters if that doesn't help.

AA11215640	Hey there-<br>  Sorry to hear that! I was in the same boat, kinda still am.<br>  I suggest you go talk to your doctor.  Explain the situation how you wouldn't like to take pills, (which may be the answer) They will then at least get you in contact with someone whom you can explain the situation with. Maybe it will just take talking to someone of support a few times to help you.  For me, the best bet was to go on meds for a little while, and then get off them.  It takes time, but nip it in the bud before you are 30 still dealing with this!<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|AA10500537	you;re having panic attacks go to the dr theres very mild   meds they can give you and you;ll feel like a new person,<br>  you have to get out theres so much to enjoy|`|E8Z5PWmcaa	why have you been cooped up for so long? even if you've only been going to school you'll still have social skills, it might take you a bit longer to adapt, but you will adapt.<br>  Besides, i cant see how getting meds will affect your employment, im on epilepsy meds and have been on umpteen antidepressants and they have never affected my future prospects (i asked my careers advisor!)<br>  Good luck <br>  Midge|`|6ErVPePEaa	Try breathing methods like meditation.

HBx6q05Oaa	First it's good to recognize these symptoms. This is not normal, try and recognize what youre doing and move on. Dont succumb to the urge and see you psychiatrist as soon as possible.|`|p96PiyiIaa	Feeling other peoples emotions mean you have a high EIQ, which is a good thing. The straw thing might just be a little compulsiveness you have, i'm sure we all have our little quirks and that just yours. With me, I seriously believed that everyone would fall in love with someone on their opposite birth month eg. I was born in April so I thought that i'de fall in love with someone born in October. I knew it was rubbish but I couldn't stop myself.<br>  My point is, not everything can be pinned  down to mental illness, some of it is simply just the quirks of human nature.
2HjfCbZUaa	Cholesterol is fatty and it clogs your arteries, causing a blockage. That makes your heart beat harder to push the blood through the clog. After a few years, the heart wears out or the clog is too big and you get heart disease.

racnq84Vaa	People that claim that Aloe Vera Juice helps IBS do not have IBS.  She needs to do what her doctor says.  While it is unfortunate that she is having these side effects, her doctor is familiar with her case and is giving her what she needs.  A layperson who knows nothing about her specific case, her medical history or any of that is not qualified to suggest medication.  Nor is another patient with IBS.  As each patient is different.  <br>  <br>  As much as you want to help her, you are not helping by giving her unprofessional advice and suggesting things that are not medically relevant to her individual needs.  Nor do you have full knowledge of her medical history or individual needs.  Just stand by her, be her friend and leave the doctoring to the doctor.  Make her feel less self conscience by treating her as normally as possible.  And ease her shaking by helping her without making her feel helpless.|`|AaoclPYCaa	My daughter has IBS and used to be on medication for it.  She changed her diet and started to go to a Chiropractor.  Now she has hardly any symptoms and is off the meds.  I don't know if this would help your friend or not but you might consult a Chiropractor.  Also she has to monitor her diet carefully and reduce stress since its also a factor.|`|xktBgoKFaa	Drink aloe juice. It helps many people with IBS , acid reflux and GERD.
XoDUTquWaa	Believe me you would be contacted immediately by phone, letter or in person if either one of these showed positive. They do usually take about a week longer to get back and read than do the others. Good luck!
JZMfUDylaa	you need to take a break. your tolerance level is up. Give it about a two week break. That helps me when i use to smoke everyday. but I don't smoke everyday anymore, I smoke about once to twice a week. I like it better that way and I get higher that way. if you want to get high as ever than take a month break. trust me it works. Peace and love<br>  legalize it!!!|`|XGPML3Lsaa	stop for a while, like a month and start up again|`|lFzFtiCBaa	same...stop 4 awhile and then smoke again. Like only wait a few days to a week though. Or switch to some better quality like some namebrand stuff, some hydro or whatever.<br>  <br>  OR...you can buy a vapoizer, that takes it to a whole 'nother level!|`|jCB7S6sfaa	start smoking better weed.OR stop smoking for a bit then smoke then you will get high again.|`|dQvKvnVuaa	Interesting place to post this question..hehe.|`|BROOfRQZaa	That means you been smoking it to much..... i don't know what to tell you cause im not into drugs like that....|`|AOtnoozdaa	If it's not doing anything for you than STOP!  I've done it, it's not addictive by any means, but stop doing it man.  It's not worth getting caught over.  Go to college, get a good job, get a hobby, because more than likely you smoke because either your bored or you don't know how to handle your stress.  Hence you want to escape from your problems rather than fix em.  That's lazy and cowardly.  Remember, those problems are there whether your high or not.<br>  <br>  You only gave me a thumbs down because I didn't say what you wanted me to say.|`|JN58HuZYaa	the best thing to do would probably smoke less so you still get a high. when you continue to smoke on a daily basis for a long period of time your body gets immune to it. same thing with caffeine or cigarettes. another  option would be to get a better quality weed|`|a2nqcdqlaa	You could also different ways of smoking it.<br>  Different equipment perhaps.|`|NZW9fuzGaa	Definitely take a break.

AA10766729	It could be micro-abrasions to the vaginal wall or even to the perineum area that are too small to be seen (or sometimes even felt) but certainly large enough to bleed.  Artificial lubricant can stop this from happening if this is the cause.<br>  <br>  It could be an infection of some sort; vaginitis, cervicitis and yeast can all cause bleeding after sex because the vaginal and cervical tissues are already being traumatized by the infection, so the friction just finishes the job (heck, I even bleed from a yeast infection by just wiping after going to the bathroom!).<br>  <br>  See your doctor to determine the cause and the solution.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	you need to make a visit to your gynecologist|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Bleeding after sex is not normal and should be evaluated by your doctor. Some causes of vaginal bleeding after sex, such as vaginal dryness after menopause, are not serious and may be easily treated. However, in some cases, vaginal bleeding after sex can be a sign of a serious underlying problem, including: <br>  <br>  Inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis) <br>  Sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea <br>  Cervical polyps <br>  Cervical ectropion, a condition in which the cervical tissue is more susceptible to abrasion <br>  Pelvic inflammatory disease <br>  Uterine fibroids <br>  Cancer of the cervix, uterus or vagina <br>  <br>  Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the bleeding. For example, if the cause is vaginal dryness due to menopause, your doctor may recommend estrogen therapy and over-the-counter water-based lubricants or moisturizers. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  be seeing you.....|`|K5SGG1QYaa	if your on the pill it might be cervical erosion, which is a very common and minor condition<br>  the pill makes your cervix relax and open up, and the skin that is exposed is sensitive and bleeds when rubbed (ie by the head of a penis) its a very minor issue and it stops quickly when you change to any other brand of pill (its the build up of one hormone that causes it)<br>  <br>  you can also get this symptom from thrush, which ca be otherwise symptomless<br>  <br>  alternatively it could be a lack of lubrication causing tiny tears at the entrance or abrasian of the walls, but this sounds very unlikely in your case, youd feel sore and know it was this. or chlamydia or gonharia (cant spell that one lol) but again this sounds unlikely.<br>  <br>  it can also be a symptom of more serious conditions, but these are fairly rare, perhaps see a doctor if none of these seem obvious.|`|brSfRLspaa	maybe you're not wet enough, try using lube, some times of the month are dryer than others|`|zTFuXOCpaa	You have at last lost your virginity LOL

However, it is time you went ahead and told your health care professionals about your problem.  They will only help you talk to your parents about it and get the help you need.  You know cutting is wrong or you wouldn't be trying to hide it.  Get the secret out so that you may learn better ways to cope with the stress and/or issues that have you hurting yourself.|`|UM9LlPWDaa	you can give them the other arm. <br>  <br>  Try other ways of dealing with your stress. Otherwise it will become a habit and be harder to break. <br>  <br>  Tell someone so they can show you different ways to deal with the stress. I for instance, bite my nails- no biggy- but I can't stop. I have found one thing that got me to stop for 3 months and then I went back to it. So I found a few different ways to make me forget about it or do something else (like chewing gum because I have to keep biting) and I rotate them. <br>  <br>  When you get so angry try drawing lines on a paper- even if you have to push so hard that the pencil starts to tear through. Something that  gets the anger out that isn't a danger to yourself and others.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|t6zrwGNraa	stop hurting yourself! you need to help help so you dont accidentally kill yourself! say nothing about it and hopefully they will reconize the cuts and help you!!<br>  <br>  good luck sweetie|`|ulI8Tx4paa	ask for other arm, you shouldn't hurt yourself|`|2lCM1agNaa	Normally they ask if you have an arm preference so you can offer the unscarred arm. If they were taking blood you may not have a choice (as they tend to go for the arm with the most palpable vein). I don't know how old you are, but as health professionals, they may bring it up if they see the scars. You are entitled to tell them that you do not wish to discuss it, they may respect your decision though I'm sure they may offer you some advice if you want to talk about it at your convenience.|`|AA10112244	Ask them to use the other arm. In cases having to do with a minor (?) are you?, if they see the scarred arm they will say something to your parents. They are required to by law, because even of it is self abuse, it is still abuse, in most states.|`|Ymv8u8EBaa	Hi<br>  <br>  it depends what injection it is.<br>  <br>  Theyshouldnt say anything to you, but if they do, you dont have to tell them<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|OAbcEvaqaa	First of all; you need some help ASAP. As far as the scars go, say you have a bruise or that arm is sore. if youre athletic, say its from working out, or pulling a muscle|`|ws6wS1c2aa	I would tell them that that arm is my main arm that I use, and don't want to risk anything.|`|UcAXZPqbaa	yea use the other arm<br>  BUT SERIOUSLY GET HELP WITH THIS!!

dpgXzMenaa	It's almost certain you've broken your hymen with a dildo if it was intact before you began using it... but you can *see* your hymen if you're curious about its condition.<br>  <br>  Get a hand mirror between your legs and look at yourself "down there" as you open things up with the fingers of your other hand and move stuff around a bit to get a good view.<br>  <br>  Compare it to<br>  <a href="http://www.the-clitoris.com/n_html/hymen.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-clitoris.com/n_html/hymen...</a><br>  and<br>  <a href="http://www.healthystrokes.com/hymengallery.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthystrokes.com/hymengalle...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  For some girls, it hurts a lot... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it, you're probably not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|gIajIrP9aa	Its hard to tell if it would have been broken when you were six. But it has broken for sure if you have used a dildo.|`|qoq9WlPxaa	yes, a dildo the size of a penis would most definitely break your hymen.|`|tCmwFJn5aa	6 years old!  You are joking right?

xmibEEdcaa	Nerve pain is tricky as hell, for a number of reasons. For one thing, nerves regenerate verrrrrry slowlllllly, if at all; it can sometimes take years for a nerve to get back to decent operating condition once it's been damaged.  For another, sometimes when your brain gets used to pain being relayed along certain pathways, it continues to register that pain even when the nerve in question is no longer firing. You can continue to suffer from the neuralgia even after the pressure on the nerve has been taken care of.<br>  <br>  There's also the problem that what we know as "sciatica" is really just a set of symptoms, which might be caused by any number of things.  So it can be tough to figure out exactly what's causing the compression on the nerve -- it might be more than one thing, in which case your "cure" may only have given partial relief, rather than solving the problem entirely.  If you had an MRI, though, then they probably got a pretty good idea of what was causing your sciatica, and your incomplete recovery is more likely to be due to one of the first two problems.|`|xRvetiAMaa	Sciatica is defined as severe pain of the sciatic nerve. In general, incomplete recovery from a sciatic problem can be a result of improper care &/or irreparable damage during care.<br>  <br>  See: <a href="http://www.totlhealth.com/painrelief.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.totlhealth.com/painrelief.htm...</a> and Google for getprolo.com|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	There can be down the line but in any nerve related distress it takes time, sometimes years. It all depend how much damage is/was done. I've had problems with the sciatic nerve for 14 years now, yes, that was 14 years. <br>        There was a lot of damage through the vertebrae though and I would only guess that was most of the problem, along with scar tissue from eight surgeries. I have had three cages down there and the last one is a disterous mess.  Now, on pain management they can only muffle the pain.

Whey protein is already in many of the things you probably eating daily. did u know it's in Cheeze it crackers.. candy bars, pop tarts and many other foods, including almost all dairy products like yogurt, milk, cheese etc. Whey is a naturally occurring protein in dairy and it has a lot of health benefits even if you don't workout.|`|E64juLwJaa	No problem at all:watch only the intake of salt when your BP is high.<br>  Planets.

You need to maintain impeccable hygiene levels in your mouth.  Try not to drink alcohol as you'll tend to "suck" your tongue and fiddle with the piercing if you get drunk.  Also french kissing is out of the question for a few more days!!  <br>  <br>  I hope that they put an extra long bar in your tongue to cope with the swelling.  Did they tell you to go back in a week to have a shorter bar fitted??<br>  <br>  Really they sound rubbish, don't use them again.  Is there another place you can go to and explain the situation - they should be able to sell you some mouthwash and swap your bar for a shorter one on saturday.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope its not too painful!|`|12R3mikmaa	you can get mouth wash for that or you can use normal mouth wash or use salt water. use it twice a day morning and at night. ive had mine done for 5years. hope that helped . :)|`|q0b6uPCraa	Go back there and ask for the proper treatment you payed for.

980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	I had many fillings done in my teeth. I never got a shot. I was so afraid when I went to the dentist because I thought she was going to have to give me a shot. It turns out I didn't need one. She told me that when people get fillings they don't need shots. Mine cavity wasn't deep. Your friend wouldn't need a shot for a filling. <br>  <br>  It didn't hurt at all to get it filled. Trust me. It's a very fast process that lasts only about 15-20 minutes. She just needs to relax and that will make her feel less nervous. When they put in fillings you don't feel it. If she feels any pain (which I doubt that she will) then she can tell her dentist to numb her.)<br>  <br>  All fillings defiantly need to get filled. You can't leave them alone. If they are left unfilled then the tooth will slowly ruin and it will cause problems for her whole body because teeth are linked to the whole body. <br>  <br>  Remind her that she needs to keep her mouth open so that it will be easier for the dentist to work with. The more she closes her mouth when they tell her to open it the more she will feel pain as a result of the dentist not having a lot of space to work with. I think she should bring an MP3 Player with her. It will help her relax.
1JbWMSataa	M'kay. After some calculations done on my calorie consumption software, it's estimated that you can eat 1600 calories a day if you walk at least 30 minutes daily at a brisk pace. Very doable. I wasn't sure if you meant August 2009 or 2010, but this is for 2009 of August.<br>  <br>  Diet plan:<br>  I can't make you a whole diet plan for all those months, but this is what I eat in a typical day and I tend to stay around 1100 calories so you can obviously eat more.<br>  <br>  Breakfast:<br>  1 Serving of cream of wheat, made with water. 1 tablespoon of passion fruit jelly.<br>  <br>  1 glass of whole milk (Milk speeds up your metabolism)<br>  <br>  Snack: 1 weight watchers yogurt<br>  <br>  Lunch:<br>  1 salad with mushrooms, bell-peppers, and low fat cheese.<br>  1 serving of italian dressing<br>  <br>  Snack: <br>  1 low fat granola bar<br>  <br>  Dinner:<br>  1 serving of Salmon seasoned with garlic, salt, and pepper.<br>  1 serving of spinach<br>  <br>  Snack:<br>  non-fat chocolate pudding - 1 snack cup<br>  <br>  Other foods you can eat without worry:<br>  A chicken patty with lettuce on a whole wheat bun or whole wheat bread. NO mayonaise.<br>  <br>  A mushroom, spinach quesadilla made with low-fat cheese and a high fiber tortilla.<br>  <br>  For snacking - a piece of string cheese, fruit (apples are really good), roasted nuts.<br>  <br>  Generally, skinless chicken, very low fat beef (try and get the 95/5 one), and fish are great meats. You can pretty much eat any vegetables you'd like, as well as fruit (though I'd watch the bananas), and a limited amount of whole grains. <br>  <br>  Work out regimen:<br>  30 minutes of brisk walking daily<br>  15 minutes of high intensity cardio or interval training 3 x a day (spreading the work outs out through the day boost your metabolism).<br>  30 minutes of weight training or core training (yoga, pilates, etc) 2 times a week. Once you get closer to your goal, you can increase it, but right now, focus should be on cardio.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ji5vcwcvaa	we need to know your age honey<br>  <br>  adults can do things when they diet that children shouldn't|`|rToeP6u3aa	Actually, you don't need to diet as such if you want to lose weight, the sole method that clearly showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Reader's Digest and CNN. I worked off twenty five pounds, it clearly does work!|`|i0YZ83YTaa	what you need to do is to portion the amounts you eat.  also, dont eat out much, try to make your own food a lot, and eat a lot of lunchmeat sandwiches at lunch, along with fruits and veggies.  When trying to eat smaller portions, get small amounts at the start, with the knowledge of you can always go back 4 more later.  That way, the whole thing with us wanting to eat everything on our plate is still attainable.  Also, make sure you drink water, not soft drinks or vitamin water or koolaid or anything like that.  And drink one glass of milk a day.

I would give your muscles a day off and rest them. ! and 1/2 hours is a lot of work for muscles, especially the legs since you're on a stationary bike. Personally, i would cut it down to maybe 15 to 30 minutes on the bike until your muscles get used to it. Then you can slowly increase it. It'll be much easier on you.|`|9ef85ae0b14dc03b38732041155f8871aa	it could be that you aren't getting enough water- try that, or maybe talk to a personal trainer because you could be over doing it or doing it wrong- but you should never ignore your body being in pain!!|`|xEnNi03haa	drink more water and carbohydrates :)
DjoyUTf3aa	When strength training, you should focus on one area a day.  So say the first day you would work on your upper body, like chest, shoulders, and arms, and then the next day work on lower muscles like your legs and abs.  And then alternate the two different ones everyday, so on Monday work upper, Tuesday lower, Wednesday upper, and so on.<br>  Also, don't forget to also work in some cardio, and 30 minutes a day along with your strength training, you should be fit in no time!
qaoQEwWVaa	You must analyze your life and solve this problem.  How is your sleeping posture?  Do you sleep on your stomach with no pillow  supporting the abdomen and lower back? Do you feel relaxed upon entering the sleep cycle or stressed? Do your head and neck hold considerable amounts of tension?  What I would highly recommend is practicing The Alexander Technique and lying backfirst on the floor for 15-20 min. 2x a day (if possible).  Remember you should not have to try to have a good night's sleep, you should already have it.  (On another note vote me a best answer so I can get these points ya dig, thanx)|`|3sDSt9koaa	Don't eat anything sugary, or watch tv/computer etc. before bed.

3YJe5Z4Faa	The only nasal spray safe for 4 year old is nasal saline (basically salt water to rinse all the snot and boogers out of the nose).  The trouble with using the nasal sprays like Afrin on 4 year olds is that these nasal sprays are basically stimulants... stimulants are used in nasal sprays because when the nose is exposed to a stimulant, it dries up.  However, when kids take these stimulant nasal sprays, they absorb too much of it into their system and end up with other stimulant effects like rapid heartbeat and elevated blood pressure.|`|KM5MNRJmaa	i would try a saline spray, not a medicated one, because the dose is probably too high for a 4 y/o. you can get saline sprays designed for children though with lighter flows.|`|TQVMAZUbaa	If you're using a nasal spray for adults, there is no way to dose properly for a 4-year-old.  You will end up overdosing her, which could be harmful.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor for alternatives.

0fd22f4354ffc03bf571367aad52d699aa	Dentists don't actually "pull" teeth out.  They rock the tooth slowly side to side until the bone surrounding it expands and the ligament breaks allowing it to slide out.<br>  If you attempt to remove the tooth and fail in the attempt, a massive problem could occur that could put you in the hospital. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|hXYjkCGpaa	I suggest a loan.<br>  <br>  But here are some common Q&A about wisdom teeth extraction: <a href="http://the-dental-makeover.com/wisdom-teeth-extraction-questions-and-answers/" rel="nofollow">http://the-dental-makeover.com/wisdom-te...</a>|`|inA6ZLeAaa	Here where I live there is a school of dentistry that will pull teeth at no charge, the only catch is that a student is doing the work.

Both times it felt like i had glass particles in my mouth.|`|zxvovv6Faa	Where I live they have certain places that are testing out certain medicines and drugs and such, and one of them is testing out the anesthetic and they pay you to have your wisdom teeth taken out.

All I can say is, and I know you don't want to hear it, listen to some of these answers.  I went and found a oral surgeon that uses this "Care Credit".  Its a credit card that you can only use on health.  Its free and no interest if you pay it off in the promotional period.  They will approve you, then you can go and just get the local anesthesia that will loosen those ligaments that hold the tooth in and the Dr can rip it out.

mGK8AnuPaa	I, too, used the elliptical. I have/had slipped discs in my back.<br>  I think the elliptical makes it easier on your joints so they aren't as strong as you'd think. When you run/jog on the treadmill you're pounding and compressing your weaker joints, causing pain..<br>  <br>  If I were you i'd do the treadmill until it began to hurt *unless it hurts continuously* and then do the elliptical for the rest of your work out time, maybe adding resistance.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also make sure you stretch regularly. It helps  relieves pressure over time.

Although you're a man, you can go to the drug store and look in the women's shaving/hair removal section. Buy a product called bikini zone, and your area won't be irritated.

dSTQnHPraa	You need to do only 1 workout a day, keep it under 45 minutes or else your body will start to digest its own muscle tissue for energy, Second of all take 1 day out of the week off. And as mentioned above you need to lower the reps and lift heavier, and also increase the sets so for example 4 sets, 8 lateral raises....ect if you continue to lift light like you are right now you will get toned but you wont gain mass. And finnaly what decides the quality of your gains is what your diet looks like. you need to eat atleast 6 meals a day, 2 hours apart containing atleast 30 grams of protein in each meal and good healthy calories. Lots of carbs before you workout.|`|woqSJNDiaa	first of all your doing too many reps on too low weight for gaining muscle mass as your doing too many reps your building muscle endurance(youll stay skinny)<br>  increase the weight and reduce the reps!<br>  also 3 times a day 7 days a week is way too overloaded!<br>  <br>  if you cant add more weight then do the exersizes as slow as you can , the slower you perform a move , the more the muscle in working!<br>  <br>  Edit- If You want to get serious then try some whey protein products , (maximuscle i can recomend)|`|apJeVkfHaa	Tally has the best advice.<br>  <br>  One thing I'd like to add is that you can lift weights perfectly every week but unless you fuel your body with food you will not gain any weight. I was 110 lbs when I was 18 and did not gain any weight until I started eating seriously. Make sure to get at least 3 protein drinks in a day, especially the one right after your work out. Start increasing the number of calories you eat until you are gaining a pound each week or two.|`|GJKsizL7aa	Yes, you are overdoing it and will not see any progress because of overtraining.

The high row and reverse fly target the upper back, between the shoulder blades as well as the back of the arms.  If you have shoulder problems, you may want to avoid pullovers<br>  <br>  Back extensions target the lower back.

Your body distributes fat at the same percentages across your body so to speak. So what you need to do is yes, taget your core, you're entire core, but do exercises that are known for burning calories/ fat. Not just cardio by the way. But the best way is a combination of intensity and resistance.<br>  <br>  Plyometrics and calisthenics (jumping jacks, box jumps, jump rope, rowing, pushups, pull ups, etc) are probably the best to combine with some light and high rep weight training (lunges, squats, standing presses, thrusters, bench presses, etc.) Or throw in core exercises in between (sit ups, jack knifes, captains chair, burpees, back extensions, good mornings, etc.)  What you want to do is pair these up and do them back to back without more than 30 second breaks to really get your body to burn those calories.  For instance, do bench presses (10) then 30 jumping jacks. 4 sets of each, the do another pair, 4 sets of each. You'll find that in 30-40 minutes you can do 8-10 exercises and burn a ton of calories, and shape right up. The most important factor is intensity!<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay focused!|`|rJgrwIodaa	Well, you can't make back fat go away with back exercises.  Fat goes away as a result of cardio exercise and eating healthy.  As for making your back stronger:<br>  Dead lifts - holding dumbells or barbells, bend forward at the waist, keeping your spine straight and let your arms just hang with the weights.  Pull yourself upright, using your back muscles (use light weights to start or you could strain your back).  Do 20 reps to start, and work your way up to 2 sets a day, every other day.<br>  Supermans - lay on your stomach on the floor or a mat in the Superman position (arms straight out above your head).  Lift both your arms and your legs.  Lower them back to the floor.  Do 20-30 reps, every other day.|`|jz7dbg2saa	pushups,sit ups,jogging/running...yoga...stratching+... before exercise is very important....maybe soccer...you get shot at your back:( happened to me today:S lol....many sports helps the back<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq4AaKL9jfl49S5ZICdu3cPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220084041AAExPYJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|CMDnwVuUaa	you could lay on your back and do sit ups because that strengthens your stomach and your back.

WXExyAlWaa	Possibly. Fear of germs is not the only manifestation of OCD - it's any behaviour that's obsessive and compulsive in nature. For example the obsessive notion that if you step on a crack something awful will happen, or finding it hard to go out because you have to keep going back to make sure the door is locked, even though you remember locking it, because what if you didn't lock it after all and someone breaks in and robs you.|`|9BbV2xqIaa	do you do rituals obsessively in order to "ensure" that misfortune will *not* come your way?<br>  for example: if you think that someone will break into your house (misfortune), do you check if the door is locked 30 times in order to ensure that this misfortune *won't* happen?<br>  <br>  and: do you think that doing something, eg. turning on the stove, would cause misfortune to you by burning down your house?<br>  <br>  I think the key thing about OCD is that you're doing rituals or being plagued by thoughts/worries about potential unfortunate happenings, to the point where it is interfering with your daily life.<br>  <br>  it's possible, in the case that these worries (and associated actions) about misfortune are taking up a lot of time.

That's why you can see flicker in old dying ones. <br>  As far the light emitted by common fluorescent lights, it is NOT A FULL SPECTRUM OF WAVELENGTHS.

Depression will certainly make you lose your appetite and it can also be dangerous because then you won't eat and you'll lose pounds and can even come to the point where it makes you sick.|`|ywer453paa	Stress can lead to people eating, yes. It doesn't happen to everyone though. Some people are emotional eaters, and do quite the opposite when stressed. If you feel that your appetite it low.. or you have a loss of it, remember to take vitamins. Any kind of vitamin pill is alright to take... and It'll keep you from getting ill. When we're stressed, we're more likely to get head colds and what not. The vitamins will keep all that at bay. <br>  <br>  Also, you want to make sure you're drinking lots of water or juice even. Keep yourself properly hydrated. <br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for you. Take it easy, and just keep in mind that things WILL get better. :)<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|xktBgoKFaa	Absolutely.

uVmwUqhIaa	Never clean a piercing with alcohol or peroxide. Both are inappropriate for this type of wound. Both can also set back the healing process. Make sure that your stud is surgical stainless steel or gold if you are not allergic to these metals. If you are unsure of what type of metal you are using, it would be best to go to a tattoo shop where piercing is offered and ask them for assistance in buying a new stud. When cleaning your piercing, leave in the stud. Taking the stud out every day will cause irritation. Irritation plus trapped bacteria will lead to infection. Clean your piercing twice a day with a sea salt soak OR diluted Dial soap. Do not use both. After cleaning, spray your piercing with Bactine. Bactine is an antiseptic and a pain reliever. Also, the red bump you have described may be scar tissue. Typically this will go away with time. It is very important for you to remember to leave your stud IN your ear. Do not take it out unless you are changing studs. You want to cause as little irritation as possible. Also, no more alcohol! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wKUst6Xyaa	First the earring must be Sterling Silver( Gold on Sterling is ok).<br>  I know it hurts. Use a Q-Tip to gently clean the area. I suggest Hydrogen Peroxide. I works great on any kind of small wound. Kills germs instantly. It took a 6 weeks for mine to stop hurting and a longer healing process than the ear lobe. Clean your ear once daily. You shouldn't have to do it more than three times in a row. Good luck.

This is often called Juvenile Diabetes.  This is the kind of diabetes that requires insulin shots to stay alive. But it is NOT limited to children-- any one of any age can become a Type 1 Diabetic.<br>  <br>  type 2 Diabetes is caused by being overweight.  this USUALLY happens to adults.  This type of diabetes can often be controlled with diet, exercise, and weight loss.  But now-a-days children are staying inside and eating snacks and playing video games, so children as young as 9 or 10 are getting Type  2 Diabetes.<br>  <br>  And it often happens that if the Type 2 Diabetic does not take care of himself, then his Type 2 Diabetes will turn into Type 1 -- and insulin shots aer required.<br>  <br>  Anyone of any age can get diabetes.  But based on your symptoms, IF you have diabetes it is probably Type 2.  Type1  Diabetics get VERY sick, more than just swollen feet and a little pain.<br>  <br>  DO NOT hesitate to be checked.  Type 2 Diabetes can be treated, and if you follow doctors orders to keep your weight down and your blood sugar readings normal, you can live as long ad as pain-free as a normal person.

dI3Q89i8aa	It may be possible. An implant involves putting a titanium post into the bone and leaving it to integrate for 6 months before putting a crown on it.<br>  <br>  If your other teeth ave drifted towards the gap a brace could help to restor their position.<br>  <br>  I don't know about the cost but I do know that if I pull out the wrong tooth I can expect to have to pay for an implant, so check if this is the same for damage caused by a doctor as you could get all your treatment for free.|`|NLAek2bJaa	If you move the teeth to the postion with braces where you want them and leave that gap open for a possible implant, it is most likely possible to get one. Your dentist needs to check that area and check bone levels to see if it can be done. The procedure is pretty painless but after the implant is placed, it takes several months for that to heal before you get a permanent tooth on it. Prices vary depending on the office, but ours is roughly $2500 per implant.|`|VriZPTHbaa	Implants are latest to replace the missing teeth; a dental implant is broken up into three phases. Phase one is the actual surgical placement of the implant. The second phase is the abutment that screws into the implant. The third phase is the actual crown that is cemented onto the abutment. I've had my two upper front teeth replaced by implants last year. After my surgery it just felt like I've had my wisdom teeth removed. Yes you can eat almost anything because there's a tissue conditioner on the temporary denture so that the area to be implanted will be safe from trauma!  So before proceeding for the implants save some money to pay out of pocket and then proceed. If you are in urgent need, travel abroad to country like India.

wqchA8B7aa	No offense, but are you gay? If so, that would be normal for you.|`|DBaFUtYsaa	Wrestling around with another guy does not make you gay. What make you straight or gay is your feelings inside of you and to whom you are attracted to. When a male gets aroused  there could be precum. Precum is designed to be a lubericante so sex is easier with your partner, male or female. Some guys will produce precum with out an erectiion.|`|AA11227341	Billy its okay.  when real wrestling guys like in sports or in the olympics wrestle they also get an erection (they use a cup to get some protection and avoid being seen--their erection)  not because they are gay, but the moments taking  place--rubbing against  each other--your penis rubs and you know how easily we guys can get an erection and when you add force as when struggling to avoid getting pinned down or just trying to escape you get an erection; the precum is just natural when you get an erection and its really hard (well at least for some guys) so it means nothing.  <br>  Now he might not like what happened (does he know about the precum or saw your erection or saw your wet spot?) and he might see you as not normal or accepts it as normal-- he knows that it happens so not no more wrestling otherwise it will happen again and than it can become an issue.

You will gain fat actually, as your muscle is used for energy, which is why your stomach wills tick out more.<br>  <br>  You also will not lose 7-8 pounds. Your body will prevent you from losing ANY weight. At most like i said, 1 or 2 pounds.|`|pWz8d8MBaa	around 1-2 but it will all be arms and leg muscle no difference in tummy,, and ull probably binge on the 2nd or 3rd dady becaseu it will make u feel very weak which will make u crave food ,, u could lose alot more wait if you ate 1400 calories and excersiesed alot the excersise will raise ur metabolism so ur losin fat when u cnt even tell. if u did that u could lose 3-4 pounds and it will be more noticible comin of the fatty areas of ur body.<br>  <br>   good luck|`|bhyVC2mtaa	sorry hun, you're not getting into that dress in 4 days without eating.<br>  I've been anorexic for 2 years, and now still in recovery. Your body isn't used to starvation, so it will go into starvation mode and the metabolism will stop. You will start losing weight in about a week. You miight lose 1-2lb. Just hit the sale racks, eat healthy and exercise everyday. After 1 month of starvation (or eatting fewer than about 400cal), you will lose about 15-20lbs. Sorry about the news. Starving your body isn't getting you anywhere, and you're likely to gain back the weight and even more once you starve yourself for more than 1 week.|`|cw42LOLBaa	Honestly... the best way to drop weight fast is not to go without eating... because you'll be miserable, tired, and probably not drop all that much.  I'm a serial dieter and I can relate to your problem.  My senior year of high school I fit into my prom dress, but it JUST fit.  So I rode 15-20 miles a day on an exercise bike and ate very little to fit into that dress.  If you want to lose weight quick exercise like you have nothing better to do and eat healthy food only when you are actually hungry.  If you are really determined you could potentially lose 5-8 lbs.  Just know now that any weight you lose in a quick diet attempt will probably come right back once you start eating correctly again, but at least you'll look the way you want for your specific day.<br>  <br>  -Good Luck!|`|tQGRJBYAaa	1-2 pounds of fat. A lot more could be water weight. Hard core wrestlers in high school eat less then 400 calories and exercise over 1000 calories a day for a month or two and lose 30 pounds, only problem is a few days of eating and there back to there normal weight when they started. Keep in mind these guys are 16-18 and ripped out of there mind so no, you shouldn't do it and you will just gain the weight back on.<br>  <br>  From not eating after a while, your body will conserve any food you eat by converting it too fat. It's called starvation mode. This may take a few days of little to no eating to kick into effect. But to get out of it you will probably gain the weight back. In a few days, you wont change enough weight up or down to gain or drop a dress size. You would need a few weeks to drop a dress size.|`|9hhxojfZaa	I don't think it is a good idea not to eat anything for four days, but here is a diet that works and won't kill you.  You can lose up to 10lbs in 7 days, so by day four you probably woul;d lose 4-5lbs, but stay on it the full seven days.  While on it, take a multi vitamin, like Centrum.  You need tio take the vitamin, because you won't be getting everything you need from the soup.  This diet is healthy and will clean all the impurities from your body.  If you eat healthy and low cal the next week, you could go back on the diet every other week and lose a lot of weight!  <br>  <br>  The Cabbage Soup Diet<br>  <br>  This 7-day diet really does work, and there's a great purity to it.  Ingredient proportions can be varied according to your likes and dislikes.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Okay, are you ready? Here we go: <br>  <br>  1 head cabbage, shredded or chopped <br>  2 large onions, chopped <br>  16-28 ounces canned tomatoes, chopped <br>  2 green peppers <br>  4 stalks celery <br>  1-2 packages Lipton onion soup mix, or any dry onion soup mix (optional) <br>  black pepper <br>  any fresh herb(s) of your choice, chopped <br>  6 carrots, sliced <br>  1/2 pound green beans, sliced. <br>  <br>  Put all vegetables in a big pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, stir in the soup mix (if desired), and boil gently for 10 minutes. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until all the vegetables are soft. Stir in the black pepper and chopped herbs. <br>  <br>  Eat as much of the soup as you like, as often as you like. Drink as much water as you like and non-caloric drinks including tea, cranberry juice, sugar free kool-aid or other sugar free powdered drinks you can get at the store. <br>  <br>  Here's what else you can eat, and when: <br>  <br>  DAY 1: All fruits except bananas. <br>  <br>  DAY 2: All vegetables, raw or cooked. This includes baked potato with a LITTLE butter. <br>  <br>  DAY 3: Fruits and vegetables, but no potatoes or bananas. <br>  <br>  DAY 4: Bananas and skim milk--eat as many as 8 bananas and drink as many as 8 glasses of skim milk. <br>  <br>  DAY 5: Beef, skinless chicken, and/or fish--as much as 20 ounces, total. You can also eat 6 tomatoes. And you must drink 8 glasses of water. Don't forget at least one bowl of soup. <br>  <br>  DAY 6: Beef, skinless chicken, or fish and vegetables. Drink 8 glasses of water and eat at least one bowl of soup. <br>  <br>  DAY 7: Brown rice, vegetables, and unsweetened fruit juice.<br>  <br>  Follow this exactly, and take the vitamin, and you'll do good!|`|mXFiSe2taa	BAD CALL...DON'T GO WITHOUT EATING AT ALL.YOU WILL FEEL LIKE CRAP.

Then I asked my kid if she had the same and she did!  Maybe it's the color of the food.  Had the ice-cream again and those were the only times that has happened.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.<br>  <br>  Also, see the article below and the source at the bottom.<br>  Green Bowel Movement<br>  The more common causes for green bowel movement, green poop, dark green bowel movements, and green stool are:<br>  Diet<br>  <br>  <br>  People can have green bowel movements if they eat large quantities of green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, or lettuce. <br>  <br>  People can have green bowel movements if they consume large quantities of green artificial coloring often found in processed foods such as sherbet, popsicles, or drink flavoring. <br>  <br>  People can have green bowel movements because of an over consumption of iron. The body won't be able to absorb all the iron, so it will excrete iron salts. Iron is found in enriched breakfast cereals, red meat, beans, spinach, baby formula, and supplements. <br>  <br>  Physiological<br>  <br>  <br>  People can have green bowel movements due to a change of colonic transit time. <br>  Illness<br>  <br>  <br>  People can have a green bowel movements if they have diarrhea|`|VqAw1z6vaa	There are mainly two causes for having a green bowel movement, your diet and fast evacuation. Eating foods that are green (such as vegetables) will make your feces a mossy green, and eating lots of lollipops or Jell-O will make it a brighter, vivid green. Eating foods rich in iron is another cause. The more you eat, the more greener your poop will be! If you're really uneasy about your green feces, see a doctor - he will most likely tell you the culprit is your diet.<br>  <br>  Another reason is fast evacuation. Your poop is naturally green inside your body and turns into a dark brown color after going through your entire system, but if the process is rushed, it won't have time to morph into its usual brown color. There are many reasons for fast evacuation, including use of laxatives, diarrhea, and food poisoning, but shouldn't be any cause for worry. If you continually have green feces accompanied by diarrhea though, see a doctor. This may be a sign of a growing problem.|`|Zb7H4B3Xaa	It could be because of the dye in certain foods you eat.  If your poop is normally green, don't worry about it.  If it happened suddenly keep an eye on it and see the doctor if it gets worse.<br>  <br>  This happened to me and I had to stop eating kids cereals like Crunch Berries and Lucky Charms because they dye would upset my system|`|A5p9g4tMaa	you have gotten too much fiber or you have eaten a lot of green Veggies.

RSBufJHUaa	To better explain what MARCY was saying:<br>  You need a hand towel, a surgical glove (NOT a food handlers), and some lubricant (NOT vaseline)...hand cream will work.<br>  Fold the towel long ways and place the glove on one end with the cuff of the glove hanging over the fold by 2 - 3 inches.  Roll the glove up in the towel, but not too tight.  Fold the cuff of the glove down over the towel so it  will keep the towel from unrolling.  Run a couple of fingers down inside the glove to open it up a bit.  Squirt some hand cream down inside.  When you're erect, slide it down over your penis and either use your hand to run it up and down or lay on a pillow and thrust.<br>  Take your time and let the feelings build up; don't go for a speed record.  Enjoy the experience!<br>  When you're done, just throw the glove into the garbage.<br>  AWESOME orgasms.   <br>  Surgical gloves are relatively inexpensive at WalMart or any drug store.

If your knee is unstable after an injury perhaps you have a torn ligaments either PCL or ACL, if the tear is partial it may heal with rest. If its total tear rest or exercise will do nothing but worsening the knee damage. Then there are 2 meniscus internal and external. They act allowing your knee flexing and extending. If the movement is painful perhaps you have a meniscal tear. It is better to spend a little be on yourself taking care of an injury that perhaps may cause you severe traumatic arthritis and more physical limitation. You can always arrange payments or look for a medicaid or county assisted clinics, where they have the doctors and the equipment to help people with no insurance, dont leave your healt on the air.

Since my surgery I can walk without getting tired, I can play with my son; I can walk down the street with my head held high. I feel pretty for the fist time in years. I was given another shot at life. The surgery is a tool and how well that tool works is up to you!!<br>  <br>  I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would recommend to every one who is suffering from the same problems as I did before but I would urge anyone who is interested to seek the best surgeon possible and make the decision based on the surgeon’s recommendations and your own personal goals!! Make sure the reasons for the surgery are the right one. The surgery isn't for someone who just "wants to be skinny". Do it for your health, for your life, for family.

If your boyfriend truly cares for you, he will at least make an attempt to understand. Remind him that everyone handles emotions differently, and this is your outlet.<br>  <br>  I know from personal experience what it is like to get picked on for having this disorder. I developed it when I was eight years old and still struggle with the urges to pull daily. I am now almost 19 years old. After a few brief relapses, I currently have not pulled in almost 10 months. There is hope. I quit "cold turkey" but what I found to be helpful in my recovery was keeping a chart for all of the days I had not pulled. I would be so proud of myself for not pulling that I didn't want to relapse and have to start all over again, so, I didn't. Try to identify what triggers you to pull. Boredom? Stress? Anger? Sadness? Once you identify your triggers, try to ignore those situations all together or come up with ways you can handle those situations in a healthier manner. Distract yourself when you get urges and keep your hands busy (drawing, cooking, video games, painting, playing with play-doh..).<br>  <br>  If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me.|`|IgztWp0uaa	Have you talked to your doctor about taking an anti anxiety to help with that?

Ice is bad bad bad for a burn, it can cause a cold burn on top of your hot burn TAKE IT OFF THE BURN!<br>  <br>  If it's numb that's bad bad bad bad bad, numbness is accompanied by a third degree burn, they burn so deep they damage your nerves, first and second degree burns never get that deep which is why you feel the pain of them. People with third degree burns rarely complain about the pain as much as those with first and second degree burns.  You can't be numb and feel pain.<br>  <br>  Place the burned area under cold water for ten minutes to reduce pain and distress and possibly give a better cosmetic result. Then wrap it in clingfilm or a clean non fluffy cloth to reduce the risk of infection and allow the area to continue cooling. This also helps reduce the discomfort caused by contact with the air.<br>  <br>  As a general rule, we advise anyone with a burn larger than a 50p piece to go down to casualty. Some small burns, however, can be very deep, so if in doubt always seek medical advice.<br>  <br>  350 degree oven is very hot, my advice is ER now, take the ice off, run it under water, clingfilm it and get yourself to a medical professional as soon as you can. I doubt very much it'll be a first degree burn, possibly a second degree burn, but also possibly a third degree burn.<br>  <br>  Mild or moderate accidental burn injuries, usually result in first or second degrees, and can most often be treated effectively at home. How to recognize the different types of burns, and their respective treatments follows:<br>  <br>  Types of burns<br>  ---------------<br>  <br>  First degree - burns are usually bright red or pink, are extremely painful and sensitive to the touch, and are usually accompanied by blistering. These types of burns can be caused by any number of heat sources, including the sun, scalds and direct heat sources, and can usually be safely and successfully treated at home.<br>  <br>  Second degree - burns penetrate deeper and damage a thicker portion of the epidermal layers. They usually appear lumpy or mottled, with a white or yellowish center, surrounded by pink or red skin. This type of burn may be treated at home so long as they are fairly small, and do not develop infection.<br>  <br>  Third degree - burns destroy all of the skin tissue, including nerves, and are characterized by numbness instead of pain. These types of burns must be treated immediately and by a physician.<br>  <br>  How to treat them<br>  ------------------<br>  <br>  Immediate care - if possible place the area under cold, running, water, or apply an icepack or cloth soaked in cold water. Tylenol and ice packs may help reduce the swelling and pain associated with burns.<br>  <br>  Cleaning - wash the area by scrubbing lightly with a clean washcloth and a gentle soap like ivory. This will promote faster healing by removing the dead and damaged skin cells, allowing the healthy tissue below to grow. If blisters are present, do not burst them.<br>  <br>  Bandages - though not always necessary, will protect the wound from potentially infectious germs and the sun, and are recommended if the wound is in a particularly vulnerable area. Supplies can be purchased at your local pharmacy or grocery store. Apply a sterile gauze pad to the freshly cleaned area, and secure with medical tape, tensor bandages or a gauze wrap. Bandages should be changed twice a day, and the burn should be well cleaned before application.<br>  <br>  Ointments - using an ointment or cream after cleaning your burn, and before applying a bandage, will help stop a lot of the itching associated with burns, as well as prevent the bandage from embedding itself into your healing skin and promote faster healing time with minimal scarring. Johnson & Johnson makes an excellent burn cream, but gentle lotions (like Nivea), vitamin E creams, aloe gels and other such products will also work well.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle - getting plenty of sleep and eating a healthy diet that consists of fruits, vegetables and proteins will encourage rapid healing byfuellingg the body with the nutrients and minerals it needs to heal.<br>  <br>  What to look out for<br>  ---------------------<br>  <br>  Infection - if at any point you develop a high fever, an considerable change in the pain or sensitivity of the wound (a sharp increase in pain or sudden numbness), thick yellow or greenish discharge (a clear watery type discharge is alright, however, it is called weeping, and is a normal part of the healing process), you may be developing an infection. See a doctor immediately.<br>  <br>  Edit: 350 degrees and you think it's below a first degree burn? That's doubtful, the burn probably hasn't come out yet. Take the ice off, run it under cold water until the heat has gone, and go from there.<br>  <br>  2nd edit: I just realised, you're probably working in farenheit, whereas I work in celsius, so you're right 350 deg isn't as hot as I thought, but it's still hot enough to burn your hand.<br>  <br>  If you haven't got anything near a first degree burn, you haven't got a burn at all. Follow the directions given above for a first degree burn, possibly even a second degree, but it shouldn't need as much medical attention as I thought at first.<br>  <br>  At the person below: Everyone makes mistakes, if someone isn't trained in first-aid they generally follow a load of myths that have been passed down the generations, ice on a burn is a common myth. If you know someone isn't trained in first-aid don't let them help, mostly they'll do more harm than good, if you need medical help, get a professional to help you. I hate having to clean up the messes of people who've tried to help, but had no idea what they were doing, whilst trying to help the patient at the same time.<br>  <br>  Common first-aid myths: <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=56907" rel="nofollow">http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?...</a>|`|h3VqVwbQaa	I burnt myself in the oven.

t81MEJ82aa	A calorie is a unit of measurement, the same way "inches" measure length.

If you eat healthy and when you are hungry, you will not have to worry about your diet!<br>  Carbs are used primarily for energy. Simple carbs (high in sugar) are used right away and give you a lot of energy, like a firework. Complex carbs are used slower and you get less energy but for a longer time.|`|1JbWMSataa	Carbs are calories, as is all food. The most fattening thing is fat, obviously, which holds double the calories per gram of protein and carbs. Carbs are actually good for you, if you eat the right kind. Whole wheat bread, brown rice for example, are good for you. Stay away from processed carbs like chips, white bread, etc.<br>  <br>  Cutting calories = weight loss, but it's better to cut fat, rather than carbs.|`|5fu3ppAqaa	OK look.<br>  To lose weight you need to have a BALANCED diet<br>  on the food pyrimad carbs are the most important thing!<br>  calories high foods such as sweets are at the top and should be eaten sparingly!<br>  In order to lose weight you should go by the food pyrimad.<br>  Carbs are so important for energy and if you cut them out you'll gain weight as soon as you re-introduce them to your diet!|`|JoyAPIGeaa	calories are the unit of energy in foods.  both carbs and fat are measured in energy.. I think that carbs are something like 3.5 calories to a gram, protein has 4 to a gram and fat has 9 calories to a gram.

Being "too cautious"<br>  in this situation is perfectly normal. just because you dont want<br>  to run around having unprotected sex just because it feels<br>  "good" doesn't mean your a prude. it means you mature and<br>  responsible and think twice about your choices that you make.<br>  <br>  i know it gets frustrating when you try to warn people and they<br>  keep over looking what your saying to them not knowing that it<br>  could help them. they always say "you sound more like my parent<br>  then my Friend" well.. some of our friends act like children<br>  and your left with no choice but to sound like that. if they cant<br>  accept that your tying to look out for them then so be it.<br>  on day they will realize you where right this whole time.<br>  <br>  i respect you.<br>  <br>  Stay Safe<br>  ?|`|iWoNMj57aa	Your right to be worried aboutt them..but you cant protect them<br>  Your correct in using protection, b/c you seriously never know what is out there...or where that thing has been before you..<br>  <br>  Continue to tell your friends about STD's and the dangers of not using protection..but it isn't your responsibility to make sure they do.<br>  Your being a good friend for just telling them what they are doing wrong.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy/STD's/ AIDS...all dangers of unprotected sex.|`|Bc8CygPIaa	You are the smart one!

Even after you tried warning them?|`|2DZaIYIuaa	What you are doing is completly fine, as you said there's nothing like being too cautious. People like your friends are the ones that regret the decisions they made in the past, and you can be the one that says "I told you so."

I did it because it felt good - that's it!<br>  <br>  Your friends - I'm sure - understand completely the ramifications for their actions.  They simply want to do what they want to do because they feel as though they can.  Simple and elementary, right?<br>  <br>  No amount of talking to them will change that.  It will change when/if they contract a disease or your female friends gets pregnant.  Then it will hit home.  But until then...<br>  <br>  Peace

NSKimt1Qaa	As long as you're not over-doing it (and it doesn't sound as though you were), and you like the new sequence, keep trying it.  If your asthma keeps bothering you, though, I would go back to the old sequence for now, until you've had a chance to go over this with your doctor.  You mentioned the fact that your daughter has bronchitis right now - does that mean that you think there's a possibility that you've picked up a bug?  That could have a lot to do with it, too.  It's good that you keep all this in mind because it makes a difference.  Good luck with your exercise routine!  I'm getting used to my new treadmill, too.  Now I wish I could get some more exercise equipment - maybe a recumbent cycle or elliptical.
5ip4EyZaaa	I had my wisdom teeth out the day after my 18th birthday.  Here are my answers, based on my experiences:<br>  <br>  1) I only bled for a day or so, and it really just oozed a bit.  Not bad at all.<br>  2) You should be okay to sleep with the gauze in, but once you stop bleeding you don't need it anymore.<br>  3) I wouldn't eat solid foods for a couple days.  Even though you can chew on the other side, you might get food particles in the holes where your teeth were removed.  You should wait for your gums to heal a bit first, and then eat somewhat soft foods until your gums heal.<br>  4) I think my gums were healed over in a week or two, but it was a couple months before they were completely back to normal.  Rinsing with saltwater helps a lot.  It stings, but it's really good for your gums, so do it anyways.  I'm sure your dentist recommended it.<br>  5) I was in pain for 3 or 4 days.  I didn't take the prescription medication (codeine) because it upset my stomach.  I was fine on ibuprofen.  My jaw was sore for a few weeks afterward, but just when I pressed on it or tried to force it fully open.<br>  <br>  Relax for a couple days and stick to soft foods.  Do the saltwater rinse after you eat, and everything should go smoothly.|`|nwxrqUnTaa	1) If you look after it, anywhere between 1-24 hours.<br>  2) Don't sleep with it in.  Hold it on the affect area for 20 mins to an hour at a time.<br>  3) Stick to cool, smooth foods for the first 24 hours, such as lukewarm soup, yoghurt etc.<br>  4) Again, it depends.  Normally 5-7 days if there are no complications.<br>  5) The pain will kick in when the meds wear off, so just keep topping up if the pain worsens (following the instructions on the packet of course.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is for a blood clot to develop in the socket, otherwise you can get what's called a 'dry socket' which is very painful.  So leave it alone, and try to resist the temptation to touch the extraction site with your fingers or tongue.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f0dnVAW7aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  When I had my wisdom teeth out I remember bleeding for almost 4 days. But I think my dentist did something wrong because my gouges never healed properly. So..<br>  <br>  1. I would say 3-4 days. Be sure to keep the same gauze on it. I had this problem too. I kept taking the blood soaked gauze off and putting new ones on.. but every time I took the gauze off I was undoing what healing it had done.<br>  <br>  2. I slept with the gauze, just make sure that it is far enough to the side for you to not choke.<br>  <br>  3. Yup. Just be sure not to open your mouth too wide and rip the stitches on the right side.<br>  <br>  4. As I said before.. my stitches came out WAY to early and my gums still haven healed (a little over a year). They will begin to seal over a little in probably a month or so.<br>  <br>  5. The pain will subside after the third day.. but continue to take your medication even after you think it's done hurting.<br>  <br>  <br>  Happy Healing :)|`|KBOcgbOVaa	I got 5 teeth out, including wisdoms, this past Wednesday so hopefully I can help!<br>  <br>  1. The real bleeding should stop tomorrow. Tomorrow, if you keep the gauze in and remove it, make sure the blood is dark - not bright red. The dark is a sign of healing and a clot should be forming.<br>  2. It's your own choice, really. It's the 6th day and I still plan on sleeping with mine in because I hate the taste of that bloody **** stuff. Plus, it's more comfortable for me because I sleep with my mouth open. <br>  3. You can try, I suppose. Just make sure that whatever you're eating isn't too awfully sharp or hard. For example, small fragments of chips or crackers could go over to the right side and get into a healing site which wouldn't be good.<br>  4. I've heard it's around a month. You'll be able to eat within a week of your extraction.<br>  5. Even now, the pain shouldn't be super. Just be sure to stay on top of your pain meds and antibiotics even when you aren't hurting. It's no fun to wait until it hurts because it seems to take forever for the meds to kick in! But, the pain shouldn't last more than two days. Your jaw will still be swollen and it will hurt if pressure is applied.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped and good luck with healing!|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Here are some common Q&A about wisdom teeth extraction,I think you;ll find here the answers: <a href="http://the-dental-makeover.com/wisdom-teeth-extraction-questions-and-answers/" rel="nofollow">http://the-dental-makeover.com/wisdom-te...</a>|`|F0LgeWs5aa	1 depends on how your blood clots. thin blood takes longer.<br>  2 I would not lay flat, I slept in a Lounge chair so it would not fall back into my throat.<br>  3 I ate soft solids no bread or bananas, they cause a vacuum effect and could pull the blood clot loose, and do not drink from a straw, again vacuum effect will pull the blood clot out.<br>  4 do you have stitches? three to five days without 7 to 10 before they are removed, still more healing.<br>  5 Take the Antibiotics as prescribed the mouth is a warm cesspool of germs. the pain depends on your tolerance.<br>  Good Luck, God Bless, Speedy recovery.
dpgXzMenaa	About a pound every 4 days is the maximum you should <br>  *allow* yourself to lose (just eat a little less and exercise a lot more and it's easy) unless you're being monitored by your doctor through a diet carefully set up for you.  Getting enough nutrition (vitamins, minerals, carbs, various amino acids) is very difficult without eating enough of the right foods.<br>  <br>  One pound every 4 days means 40 days should get you a max weight loss of 10 pounds... doing it any faster just isn't healthy.|`|4wINNSSeaa	dont go on a diet, just do loads of exercise<br>  once u come of the diet u will put on more weight|`|nSev0G2Haa	have someone break your jaw so you can go on a liquid diet.|`|cyt7oh97aa	Okay, I calculated your calorie intake (on the basis that you don't exercise), and to maintain the weight you have now you need to be eating 1945 Calories/day.  To begin to lose weight you need to be eating the most, 1556 Calories/day, and to do extreme fat loss you need to eat the most, 1480 Calories/day.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend is 27, about 6' 3" and when he started he weighed about 260.  After about a month, he lost 16 lbs and it's very noticeable that he's trimmed down (and he doesn't exercise.)  So that's about 4 lbs a week, which is a healthy weight loss.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend limits himself to 1500 calories a day, so he'll have a banana for breakfast, which keeps him full till lunch, and then at lunch since most of the main food he eats at lunch is bad he'll just eat whatever fruit and veggies is served that day (he's a teachers aid at a middle school.)  And then by the end of the day he can have a nice well rounded supper.  <br>  <br>  Do some research, look up the calories in the foods you eat every day and see if you need to substitute some of your favorite foods.  He used to drink a lot of Mt. Dew so he switched to a can of Coke Zero (cherry or vanilla) and drinks mostly water.  He stopped eating chips, fast food, and anything after 9 pm.  <br>  <br>  If you do some sort of activity, maybe ride your bike or go on a walk once or twice a week that will help.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

MMUGLjsPaa	Yes, it is possible, however, if your b/f isn't taking his meds this is a very bad sign and he's in a very dangerous place mentally.  One of the issues in treating depression is that when the patient gets the right set of meds and begins taking them they start to feel better (takes about 6 weeks to 3 months).   Then they rationalize, "Hey, if I'm feeling better then what do I need these meds for?" and then they stop taking them.  3 to 4 weeks down the road they start feeling bad again and it now becomes more difficult to get them to take the meds because they don't think they need them. <br>  <br>  Use your relationship as a positive force and encourage him to talk to someone who can help like his Mom / Dad or another positive influence that he's close to. Negative pressure is just going to drive him further away.  You have got to find a way to positively encourage him to get back on those meds. <br>  <br>  He must be someone you care for very deeply, else you would have split by now.  Don't give up on him.  You're probably the most positive influence he has. The result will be a much stronger relationship but you've got to get through it together.|`|qKGbvKe6aa	he needs serious help because once they shut down like that it MAY cause suicide. try your best to get close and see if he will open up. try not to push too hard in asking him to open up. get close by getting him out to a funny movie or a park simple walks|`|qjy5OirNaa	sure|`|064d509071f7e7654d74e7d2f3ef5351aa	As long as you realize that the only person in this world that you can help is yourself, you'll be OK.  The biggest risk is that he will do something dramatic and you will blame yourself.<br>  <br>  He is 16.  He should be in school.  Doesn't anyone there realize something is wrong???  How are his grades???  Take your question to one of the counselors at school...or to the school psychologist (yes, every school has one - maybe not full-time)<br>  <br>  Since you can't real help him other than to offer support, you need to tell him how you feel.  You need to tell him you are scared, and you need to ask him how you can help him.  Remind him that you are not a doctor or a therapist, and that you can't help him with the things he tells you.<br>  <br>  And lastly, you may need to create space to take care of yourself.  You need to let him know how much you care about him, and that it hurts too much to see him like this.  He needs to take his meds, and he needs to TALK to his therapist, and those are the conditions for you to keep seeing him.  It may sound cruel, but you are jot responsible for the way his, and you cannot help him.  Depression is beyond talk.  Meds and talk work better than either by themselves, and far better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|FU4TyghIaa	reality is, plenty of people without 'mental illness' have really awful abusive relationships.  So in the world test, you can do better than they, and ironically better than plenty of psychiatrists who are control freaks and poison all their communications with their arrogant insecurities.  <br>  <br>  When people say, take your meds and la la, then the side effects, you don't mention either.  Well, typically, taking meds that destroy your libido or worse your ability to perform (in the sack), frankly, that's not much of a lover huh?  And if the meds do that and everybody says you should, it's easy to get depressed by anti depressants that can do that to ya.  The psychiatric community can be pretty stupid when it comes to understanding that and can tend to give priority to how many free holidays to conferences and stuff the pharmaceutical coys have given them sometimes.  Unfortunate reality.  <br>  <br>  It can be hell, but being scared for him you do care.  Sadly, noone can really give you advice on a journey only you and he can charter.  You're young and it is a big burden to shoulder at your age.

See what other samples they have lying around left over from the last conference they can try.<br>  <br>  I wish you well, but understand it is your choice to be with him.  In the midst of depression there may be other unique characteristics about him that you really love.  Any choice in love is like that.  Take the good with the bad and embrace it all.  Be it depression your man suffers or maybe he's hooked on motor racing and spends the weekends watching speedway racing, maybe he gambles, maybe he drinks and leers after women in short skirts.  It's the good with the bad, we all make choices and sacrifices.<br>  <br>  Hope you find enough good in him and feel the love enough to support him if you do.  We all have our love tested at times,.

I've been out with a manic depressive before, and when he was going through a low I just had to detach myself and let him disappear and not contact me, and just get on with things. It's difficult, but can be done. Sometimes it's better to let them know you're there for them rather than check up on them constantly. Just let him know you're there to support him, and understand that if he needs space or time alone it's nothing personal.
3QIWdvG1aa	There's no cure for the common cold. Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses. Over-the-counter cold preparations won't cure a common cold or make it go away any sooner, and most have side effects. Here's a look at the pros and cons of some common cold remedies.<br>  <br>      * Pain relievers. For fever, sore throat and headache, many people turn to acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or other mild pain relievers. Keep in mind that acetaminophen can cause liver damage, especially if taken frequently or in larger than recommended doses. Be especially careful when giving acetaminophen to children because the dosing guidelines can be confusing. For instance, the infant-drop formulation is much more concentrated than the syrup commonly used in older children. Never give aspirin to children. It has been associated with Reye's syndrome — a rare but potentially fatal illness.<br>      * Decongestant nasal sprays. Adults shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays for more than a few days because prolonged use can cause chronic inflammation of mucous membranes. And children shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays at all. There's little evidence that they work in young children, and they may cause side effects.<br>      * Cough syrups. In winter, nonprescription cough syrups practically fly off the drugstore shelves. But the American College of Chest Physicians strongly discourages the use of these medications because they're not effective at treating the underlying cause of cough due to colds. Some contain ingredients that may alleviate coughing, but the amounts are too small to do much good and may actually be harmful for children. In fact, the college recommends against using OTC cough syrups or cold medicines for anyone younger than age 14. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly recommends against giving OTC cough and cold medicines to children younger than age 2. Meantime, under an agreement announced by manufacturers in late 2008, several brands of OTC cold and cough medications began carrying a warning that these products should not be used in children under 4. For young children, an accidental overdose could be fatal. Coughs associated with a cold usually last less than two to three weeks. If a cough lingers longer than that, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  You may not be able to cure your common cold, but you can make yourself as comfortable as possible. These tips may help:<br>  <br>      * Drink lots of fluids. Water, juice, tea and warm soup are all good choices. They help replace fluids lost during mucus production or fever. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can cause dehydration, and cigarette smoke, which can aggravate your symptoms.<br>      * Try chicken soup. Generations of parents have spooned chicken soup into their sick children. Now scientists have put chicken soup to the test, discovering that it does seem to help relieve cold and flu symptoms in two ways. First, it acts as an anti-inflammatory by inhibiting the movement of neutrophils — immune system cells that help the body's response to inflammation. Second, it temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose, helping relieve congestion and limiting the time viruses are in contact with the nasal lining.<br>      * Get some rest. If possible, stay home from work if you have a fever or a bad cough, or are drowsy from medications. This will give you a chance to rest as well as reduce the chances that you'll infect others. Wear a mask when you have a cold if you live or work with someone with a chronic disease or compromised immune system.<br>      * Adjust your room's temperature and humidity. Keep your room warm, but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air and help ease congestion and coughing. Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.<br>      * Soothe your throat. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day or drinking warm lemon water with honey may help soothe a sore throat and relieve a cough.<br>      * Use saline nasal drops. To help relieve nasal congestion, try saline nasal drops. You can buy these drops over-the-counter, and they're effective, safe and nonirritating, even for children. To use in babies, put several drops into one nostril, then immediately bulb suction that nostril. Repeat the process in the opposite nostril. Doing this before feeding your baby can improve your child's ability to nurse or take a bottle, and before bedtime it may improve sleep.<br>  <br>  Alternative medicine<br>  <br>  Alternative therapies probably won't cure your cold, but they may help make you more comfortable by easing your symptoms.<br>  <br>  Echinacea. Whether taking preparations of the herb echinacea protects you from getting a cold or relieves cold symptoms continues to be debated. While no studies have shown that taking echinacea can prevent you from getting a cold, there is some evidence that it can modestly relieve cold symptoms or shorten the duration of a cold.

If your body needs to expel something, it will probably do it naturally. You could injure your throat and possibly make the stomach ache worse by forcing yourself to throw up.

H0aiDO9Paa	It's appropriate if streptococcal bacteria are causing the soreness. You probably have strep if your throat is deep red with white patches, you have a fever that started suddenly, and the lymph nodes in your neck are painfully enlarged.<br>  If the infection isn't causing major discomfort and doesn'tseem to be serious, wait for your doctor to confirm strep throat by taking a throat culture. But antibiotics won't help and may harm if a virus is the culprit. That's likely if you have other cold or flu symptoms such as a stuffy or runny nose or sneezing. While viral infections generally resolve on their own, see your doctor if the soreness lasts more than three days. If you experience extreme fatigue, difficulty opening your mouth, or severe difficulty swallowing, seek help immediately; you may have an abscess.<br>  <br>  Whatever the cause, you can soothe your throat by sucking on cough drops, gargling with warm saltwater, eating ice cream or ice pops, drinking lots of fluids, humidifying dry air, and using throat sprays containing dyclonine (Cepacol Maximum Strength Sore Throat Spray, Sucrets Throat Spray) or phenol (Cheracol Sore Throat Spray). And good luck.|`|fPLv0QrSaa	Gargle with warm salt water. I usually put a tablespoon in a cup of warm water and mix it in. Gargle and spit it into the sink.

It's an over-the-counter remedy that you can find in any drugstore or even the medicine aisle of a supermarket. It will numb the back of your throat so you won't feel the pain.  Depending on how bad your throat is, you may even be able to sing through it, although I have to warn you: doing that will make it feel 10 times worse the next day.  But if you absolutely *have* to perform, then throat-numbing spray is the way to go.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't have to perform tonight, I'd still recommend the spray.  It numbs the pain considerably.  Also gargle with warm salt water, drink tea with plenty of honey in it, and try to avoid dairy products.<br>  <br>  If your throat doesn't get any better in a day or two, or if you notice white spots forming on your tonsils, then go see a doctor.

Take maximum pain relief, codeine and paracetamol and alternate with ibuprofen (if you have asthma, stomach or kidney problems, don't use ibuprofen).  Plenty of warm drinks, suck on boiled sweets or pastilles to produce extra saliva and lubricate your throat.  If severe problems swallowing liquids or your own saliva, visit doctor.
uVMlNvLoaa	Use tampons, they help a lot with the icky wet gross feeling--you don't feel anything with tampons! Sometimes if you don't insert them far enough in, you can feel the string, but it's really easy to remove and insert them.|`|AA12212403	I agree with the tampon thing.<br>  When I was younger that wasn't enough to make it through the day.<br>  I would use a heavy duty pad, plus a tampon and go to the ladies room midday to change everything.  <br>  Some of us are just "blessed" with this.<br>  I'm wondering if you should check in with your doctor if things are that bad?  <br>  You have my sympathy as least.|`|3ckc7waBaa	when i was in year 7 i felt i was too young to use tampons and yeah i felt it come out. really wasnt nice. <br>  <br>  honestly tampons are the best thing ever.<br>  or the contraceptive implant it stopped my periods?<br>  <br>  why dont you want to use tampons anywyas?|`|YJ3pPYCOaa	yeah i totally understand i hate it when you can feel it leak. it sucks that you can't wear tampons. if its because your scared, then i would advise you to get over your fear because tampons are life savers. you can't feel the blood and you cant feel the tampon. but if there's just no way to wear tampons and you absolutely have to use pads, i'm so sorry. you're just gonna have to hold your head up high and pretend everythings okay. theres no way to make the feeling go away. just wear pads for heavy periods and do your best.|`|mFQnLtovaa	use tampons...when u first try then..relax or it will be really uncomfortable..make sure you get it in far enough and that you use ones that are right for you..start with a light days one or regular until you get used to wearing them..best of luck hun!|`|brSfRLspaa	that's why I wear tampons, I only wear pads at night on my light days|`|zdTyhDsuaa	I know what you mean<br>  especially in the morning when you first stand up-ive done the army crawl multiple times to the bathroom, but my brother always gives me wierd looks and I dont think it really helps much lol<br>  If i were you I would try tampons. They are A LOT easier (for me, at least), and you dont get that gross feeling. You also dont have to worry about smelling, they last longer, and if you have a heavy period you can even wear a pad and a tampon at the same time.|`|ccRBFQTtaa	So you wear pads? then try tampons....  My periods used to be like that honest they changed after I had my little boy three years ago, girl I do know how you feel there really is nothing to do about that, you might want to talk to your doctor there is a birth control pill that can lighten your periods just dont ever let your Dr give you the one that takes away your period... Thats messing with mother nature .......|`|3GY44mJTaa	Yes, it's normal to feel when blood is coming out. One solution could be the use of tampons. Remember that you should change them before 6 hours (I rather change every 4) to prevent biggere helath problems. Also, when using tampons, use a panty liner.|`|eiL8f6Ijaa	i have the same problem, my advice use a tampon and if you feel like that isn't working you should wear a pad under that just so that you are sure that you aren't going to have one of embarrassing moments where there is a giant red spot on your pants.  Hope i helped|`|7WbehQZjaa	I do too sometimes. The pill or other birth control drugs tend to lighten and shorten your periods, as well as lighten any symptoms(cramps, etc). Maybe try tampons as well to see if the feeling goes away?|`|dnb1Hwzqaa	you may want to try using tampons they will keep the blood from coming out as long as you change them often enough.|`|Ck0MIoh3aa	tampons cure that..|`|Xn3wj9LUaa	tampons are your best bet

Get and M.R.I and all types of X-Rays and things and if they say it is unnecessary but demand it. If nothing shows up try really thinking back seeing if anything may have triggered it. A car accident, eating something new? Anything that may relate to your feelings. And if that doesn't show anything try seeing if you have anything at home or work or whatever that maintains high levels of Nickle or Lead. Hope that helps!|`|obE9Md17aa	kill myself

GOUgocyAaa	i do the same thing! once it hurts i think constantly about wanting to stop and that makes it so much harder to  keep going. What usually works for me is keep challenging yourself to just go a few more. Instead of thinking about how much it hurts say to yourself "ok ill just do 5 more" and then "i'll just do 10 more". Eventually you will build up more resistance so  you'll find it will be easier to do more without it hurting. So just force yourself to push through the pain even if it's only for 5-10 more|`|wwRbkCMraa	Push a little harder every time NO MATTER WHAT!!!! and hopefully you will build up more tolerance to the pain.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	do them in sets with 30 seconds between each set so you have a small recovery you should be able to do more that way|`|tXmu16Niaa	How many do you do?  I usually do three sets of 12.  It helps me to focus on the counting of going down and holding the position and then counting when coming back up.  Make up your own counting pattern, you will be more focused on not messing up on your counting it might take away from the feel of the burn.  Good luck!

Generally, it's not a problem unless my skin is dry or I use a harsh product on my skin.... <br>  <br>    On occassion I'll get acne but, not often.  So, I recommend using a more gentle cleanser like CETAPHIL for dry, sensitive skin.  You can use it with or without water... It's not expensive around $10 for a large container.  If you get acne you can use WITCH HAZEL as a toner it's less harsh than most other products and easy to find.. For a large container about $5.  Swipe with a cotton ball across the face when you get acne... I also exfoliate about 2x a week.. I use baking soda mixed with my cleanser.  Baking soda is cheap and easy to find it's also good for sensitive skin... <br>  <br>      I just recently purchased some more expensive dept. store products to try.. I use ORIGINS DR. WEILS skin care products... They work very, very well at controlling my sensitive skin issues... I use a moisturizer and serum... My skin looks, younger and the red is completely gone....

Post pics (with and without the skinny jeans)!|`|AA11227341	Yes its possible Davey, the thing is that wearing tight jeans or undies keep your testicles close to the body which means that they are getting hot; our testicles need to be cool and hang so that our body temperature does not slow the production of sperm so your mom makes sense so listen to her. Now, you can wear tight jeans or undies but not always or you know what can happen.|`|vJxuWyueaa	Yes, too much heat and pressure down there causes reduced sperm count.|`|5yCdBRjiaa	IDK but just try to have you balls loose every once in a while. just use loose underwear at night.|`|um29wkUPaa	I didn't think guys wore skinny jeans.

XCPctxGHaa	no, you might have a sore throat but i don't think a runny nose because you would've been sneezing alot today.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	Symptoms of a common cold usually appear about one to three days after exposure to a cold virus. Signs and symptoms of a common cold may include:<br>  <br>      * Runny or stuffy nose<br>      * Itchy or sore throat<br>      * Cough<br>      * Congestion<br>      * Slight body aches or a mild headache<br>      * Sneezing<br>      * Watery eyes<br>      * Low-grade fever (up to 102 F, or 39 C)<br>      * Mild fatigue<br>  <br>  The discharge from your nose may become thicker and yellow or green in color as a common cold runs its course. What makes a cold different from other viral infections is that you generally won't have a high fever. You're also unlikely to experience significant fatigue from a common cold.<br>  <br>  When to see a doctor<br>  For adults — Seek medical attention if you have:<br>  <br>      * Fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher<br>      * High fever accompanied by achiness and fatigue<br>      * Fever accompanied by sweating, chills and a cough with colored phlegm<br>      * Significantly swollen glands<br>      * Severe sinus pain<br>  There's no cure for the common cold. Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses. Over-the-counter cold preparations won't cure a common cold or make it go away any sooner, and most have side effects. Here's a look at the pros and cons of some common cold remedies.<br>  <br>      * Pain relievers. For fever, sore throat and headache, many people turn to acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or other mild pain relievers. Keep in mind that acetaminophen can cause liver damage, especially if taken frequently or in larger than recommended doses. Be especially careful when giving acetaminophen to children because the dosing guidelines can be confusing. For instance, the infant-drop formulation is much more concentrated than the syrup commonly used in older children. Never give aspirin to children. It has been associated with Reye's syndrome — a rare but potentially fatal illness.<br>      * Decongestant nasal sprays. Adults shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays for more than a few days because prolonged use can cause chronic inflammation of mucous membranes. And children shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays at all. There's little evidence that they work in young children, and they may cause side effects.<br>      * Cough syrups. In winter, nonprescription cough syrups practically fly off the drugstore shelves. But the American College of Chest Physicians strongly discourages the use of these medications because they're not effective at treating the underlying cause of cough due to colds. Some contain ingredients that may alleviate coughing, but the amounts are too small to do much good and may actually be harmful for children. In fact, the college recommends against using OTC cough syrups or cold medicines for anyone younger than age 14. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly recommends against giving OTC cough and cold medicines to children younger than age 2. Meantime, under an agreement announced by manufacturers in late 2008, several brands of OTC cold and cough medications began carrying a warning that these products should not be used in children under 4. For young children, an accidental overdose could be fatal. Coughs associated with a cold usually last less than two to three weeks. If a cough lingers longer than that, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  You may not be able to cure your common cold, but you can make yourself as comfortable as possible. These tips may help:<br>  <br>      * Drink lots of fluids. Water, juice, tea and warm soup are all good choices. They help replace fluids lost during mucus production or fever. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can cause dehydration, and cigarette smoke, which can aggravate your symptoms.<br>      * Try chicken soup. Generations of parents have spooned chicken soup into their sick children. Now scientists have put chicken soup to the test, discovering that it does seem to help relieve cold and flu symptoms in two ways. First, it acts as an anti-inflammatory by inhibiting the movement of neutrophils — immune system cells that help the body's response to inflammation. Second, it temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose, helping relieve congestion and limiting the time viruses are in contact with the nasal lining.<br>      * Get some rest. If possible, stay home from work if you have a fever or a bad cough, or are drowsy from medications. This will give you a chance to rest as well as reduce the chances that you'll infect others. Wear a mask when you have a cold if you live or work with someone with a chronic disease or compromised immune system.<br>      * Adjust your room's temperature and humidity. Keep your room warm, but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air and help ease congestion and coughing. Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.<br>      * Soothe your throat. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day or drinking warm lemon water with honey may help soothe a sore throat and|`|QCL7WIEtaa	you might.  hope that helps :)

BCzrcwKFaa	first of all, calm down.  being a 21 year old virgin really isn't the end of the world.  while aspergers may make it more difficult for you to find a girlfriend, i highly doubt that it prevents you from ever finding a partner.  i also doubt there are any studies on how many highly functioning autism suffers die virgins.  i think you'd probably find that there are many perfectly normal males who are 21 and virgins, just like there are many virgin females at that age.  i can tell you that looking for a drunken one night stand is NOT going to get you any girlfriends... or even female friends.  <br>  do you have female friends?  stop worrying about when you'll get in their pants and be their friends first.  they may realize how wonderful you are once they get to know you, without all the sexual expectations.|`|vGxipYJnaa	As you know, Aspergers makes it harder to interact socially in general - which would also affect your abilities in a romantic setting. <br>  <br>  Having Aspergers doesn't mean you won't have a girlfriend or have sex - you just need to find a girl who is easy to read and isn't into playing head games (which is pretty much every guy's dream anyway). You're only 21, you're not going to die anytime soon so I really wouldn't worry about dying a virgin. You'll be fine - just find the right girl!|`|AA11849364	"Also Males with Asperger Syndrome have it a lot harder than Females with Asperger Syndrome when it comes to Romance, Dating, Relationships, Sex, One-Night Stands, Hook-ups, Casual Sex, etc"<br>  Y' think?

I'm not sure about you, but there are times that I don't react to things that people"should" react to, or I react "inappropriately" to the situation, and have scared people. What is"normal" really?

I feel weird now.|`|eEJGGEYjaa	thats... a weird thing to learn about in skool.<br>  they teach "it" to you?<br>  do they teach  you the intructions or anything, lol.<br>  they didnt teach us about that, YET<br>  Edit:<br>  nvm i learned it in 4th grade|`|Bc8CygPIaa	Listen to your teacher and talk to your parents because you dont want to learn the "wrong" things from your misinformed friends|`|IbPpYiQkaa	I was in 5th grade.

Women who think they have stopped growing actually haven't, they're still fluctuating slightly; just not enough for them to notice. <br>  <br>  If you have back pain you might be able to get a reduction, but this doesn't mean they won't grow again. <br>  <br>  In my experience guys like big boobs though.

So you won't be able to get a breast reduction until at least 18 or older. There are only two things you can do right now: 1) Accepting your breasts, as they will always be with you, and 2) investing in great bras. Go to a store where they are willing to measure you (a little invasive) for a proper bra.

If you're training them to only do 100 push ups then you're doing great.  If you're wanting to increase strength and size then you're going to have to mix it up.  <br>  Try different types of push ups. <br>  Go to the gym and do pectoral workouts:<br>  With a barbell and/or dumbells: bench, flies, inclines, declines.<br>  Dips: parallel bars, olympic rings (made a big difference for me).<br>  There are more exercises, these are just off the top of my head.<br>  Keep your body guessing.  Routine is the enemy.|`|ZCAnfK3Taa	sounds good to me i used to do 100 crunches each night and 15 push-ups if their easy for you and you don't get severely pain or anything then it seems all right to me|`|LzNzgU8Faa	OMG youre probebly strong like hell  but give them about 2 days rest then move onto 150 :)|`|tXmu16Niaa	You are fine.  You are using your own weight, so you are not straining your arms in any way.  You should do cardio, too.  I am guessing you are trying to get muscle tone.  If you have a layer of fat above your muscles, then you are not going to see the best results, unless you incorporate cardio, which burns the fat off, with the push-ups.  Good Luck!
tIldpr7vaa	yes its best to work out one muscle group a week<br>  <br>  ex:<br>  <br>  1 day do chest<br>  1 day do legs<br>  1 day do back and biceps<br>  ect....<br>   and repeat every week <br>  <br>  Your muscles need time to rest and grow.

dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's possibly an infection and you should see a doc.|`|EnYLhQajaa	Discharge is the vagina's way of cleaning itself. It is perfectly normal, and usually arrives about a year before your first period.<br>  It is white/yellow in colour, and may have a faint smell, but if it smells really bad and is chucnky, you may have a yeast infection.<br>  If it gets really think or you get large amounts, you can use a panty liner.|`|brSfRLspaa	cervical mucus<br>  <a href="http://www.fertilinet.com/Cervical%20Fluid%20and%20Fertility.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilinet.com/Cervical%20Flu...</a><br>  <br>  Cervical Fluid is the mucus that is secreted from the cervix.

Anorexia is a mental illness and it's difficult for anorexics to gain weight because they are so unhappy with themselves.<br>  <br>  All anorexics are mentally ill and very unhappy with their own bodies. An obese person is likely to be unhappy with themselves too, but obesity doesn't necessarily come with mental illness the way anorexia does. I'm sure there are plenty of happy obese people, but very few (or no) happy anorexics.<br>  <br>  =]|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Anorexia is worse. A person CAN be obese and live a relatively long life, despite all of the diseases that are co-morbid with obesity. Anorexia will almost certainly kill you, if it is left untreated.

It depends if your looking for an argument on one or the other, just use these cases about how the other side is just as bad. but putting mental and physical issues aside, i would say that in these times anorexia is the best way to go because thats what everyone thinks is so beautiful (being skinny) but eaither way its all messed up! hope i helped in some way.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	OBESITY<br>  <br>  There are so many serious illnesses associated with it and such a huge percent of our population is now obese.<br>  <br>  you certainly dont hear that about anorexia, now do you?|`|d2a3834786860b34ae904f14b9d846faaa	Obesity  is  definitely  worse. <br>  <br>     Obesity can lead  to  Diabetes,  Heart Disease, Increased  chance of Cancer,  ...........and the list goes on and on.|`|bsRjimOOaa	I guess obesity is worse due to all of the health issues that come along with being overweight.|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	They're both just as bad and dangerous for your health.|`|uky2nsh8aa	Anorexia<br>  <br>  i'd rather date someone fat than someone i can see the bones of, i don't want that until their dead, and think it's disgusting.

They sell the basic one for less than $200 and the better one of less than $400 dollars. with free shipping site to store: A lot of difference than price of ones you see on Chuck Norris info-mercials which sell for up in the $1,000's +<br>  Sears also sells them as well but a little more expensive:<br>  Bayou fitness sells several models from the basic to the more advanced ones. They also offer free shipping. <br>  .<br>  Trick to that is everytime the commercials come on when you are at home watching TV get on it a exercise instead of heading to the Frig for a snack.<br>  Something else you can get for the house is a small inexpensive elliptical trainer or bike.

The outbreak could have been caused by something that they DIDN'T eat, but it was not caused by something that they DID eat.<br>  <br>  Stress is also considered one of the main contributors to outbreaks of adult acne. You can't avoid stress altogether and live on planet earth. That isn't possible. But you can learn to manage your stress and thereby help to control your acne outbreaks. There are all kinds of relaxation techniques that one can learn to practice; deep breathing exercises, yoga, etc.<br>  <br>  The one thing that adults who suffer from acne outbreaks should remember is do NOT purchase products that are designed to treat teenage acne. These products are designed to dry the skin and, as an adult, you don't want to use products that will dry your skin because that will cause increased wrinkling.

ufgv7oTjaa	Well, there are a few points to this. That's a rather low dose of Saw Palmetto, so that would be your first drawback. <br>  On the positive side, Saw Palmetto does help in regulating some aspects of Testosterone, including the conversion into DHT (DiHydroTestosterone). If your hair loss is due to higher levels of DHT, this can certainly help a little, but there are several other nutrients that can help as well. Specifically, He Shou Wu (an herb, also called Foti), Beta Sitosterol, Pumpkin Seed Extract, and Lycopene among other nutrients can inhibit the production of DHT. <br>  Also, in regards to the other askers, nobody ever claimed that Saw Palmetto would prevent prostate cancer... they are good for the prostate health, but that's all that's been claimed. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Independent tests have shown Saw Palmetto doesn't do a thing.  Save your money and spend it on Fish Oil - at least that's been proven to help lower cholesterol.|`|WPzaF2osaa	Tons of tomatoes and fields of saw palmetto plants may have perished in vain, suggest authors of two studies presented here at the American Urological Association's 2005 Annual Meeting.<br>  <br>  Lycopene, found in tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables, does not appear to decrease the risk of prostate cancer, and saw palmetto was no better than placebo in a randomized controlled trial for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).<br>  <br>  But, a third study found that men with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after definitive prostate cancer therapy who drink 8 oz daily of pomegranate juice had significantly longer PSA doubling times.<br>  <br>  In general; alternative medicine may have some effect on health, but is not proving until studies are done. Also be careful with dietary supplements, because they may cause more harm than good. <br>  Hair loss may be treated with Minoxidil solution, which is effective according to studies.

Damn I am Hungry!|`|cASB8Sh3aa	Typically the weed itself is not the issue with causing bad effects on your diabetes, its the munchies and not taking care of the diabetes that will get you in trouble.  For many people who are diabetic and smoke, they do not see any changes in their blood sugars.  What they do notice is that it is harder to tell if they are low or high blood sugar wise.  So if you are going to do it, test every hour or so and see what it does to your sugar.  If you decide to munch out, make sure you are careful taking your insulin to cover what you are eating.  If you are too out of it you may take too much or too little which is super dangerous.

It doesn't mean the cancer will definitely never come back.<br>  <br>  Partial remission means the cancer has shrunk.<br>  <br>  It's a commonly held belief that cancer is considered cured if it has been in remission - ie the patient has been cancer-free - for five years, but this is true only for certain cancers.<br>  <br>  With some cancers - eg cervical and testicular - if there is no evidence of any recurrence 5 years after diagnosis, the cancer will not recur.<br>  <br>  For most cancers though, the chance of recurrence falls steadily but does not drop to zero after 5 years. It decreases progressively as the years pass. The speed at which the chance of recurrence falls depends on the type of cancer.<br>  <br>  With breast cancer, for example, most recurrences happen within two years of diagnosis. After 5 years the chances of recurrence are statistically much lower, and continue to fall as the years pass. After 10 years, if there's no evidence of recurrence or spread, the chances of recurrence are very low.|`|YAWkCPqYaa	google it in , it will explain in detail to you|`|jWcTFg6eaa	Remission is the state of absence of disease activity in patients with known chronic illness. It is commonly used to refer to absence of active cancer. This does not mean that the patient is cancer free. The general opinion of the health community is if the patient remains in remission for 5 years or more than they are consider cancer free.|`|rMB71kZ8aa	That means that there is no sign of the disease in the person's body.<br>  <br>  Muriel L you should be more positive.

FicyC2TXaa	Breast cancer can return at any time, even years later. Most recurrences happen within two years, and after 5 years the chances of a recurrence are statistically much smaller and continue to decrease as the years pass. If the cancer never returns, the person can be considered to have been cured, but people who've had breast cancer are told they have 'no evidence of disease' (NED) rather than that they are cured.<br>  <br>  Yes, chemotherapy and radiotherapy save many lives, and prolong many more. But they aren't a guaranteed cure for cancer - there is no such thing.<br>  <br>  It is the cancer's aggressiveness rather than necessarily its size that makes it more serious.<br>  <br>  It is excellent news that your mum's prognosis is good and that her medical team feel they managed to remove all the cancer.<br>  <br>  By the way - giving just about every word a capital letter makes your question quite difficult to read.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	Sorry for your mum, but there is no cure for breast cancer. Drs can even take both breasts completely off and it is a good possibility it will still return. My daughter's friend's mother just died 2 days ago after being treated several years ago and declared in remission. It had spread all through her body, including her brain. They may all be just telling you the best outcome because it's your mum. How come a GP is treating her and not an oncologist? Send her prayers.|`|oojO4WAraa	It is a treatment for cancer.  A successful treatment.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I have had breast cancer twice and had lumps similar in size to your mum's.  When the cancer is removed they also take an area around the lump and test it to see if it is clear.  If it is, then this is a good sign and they then give radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy to clear up any stray cells in the rest of the breast.  People are then said to be in remission.  Cancer can come back at any time but usually doesn't.  My first lump was in 2003 in my left breast and my second in 2005 in my right breast.  It is now 2009 and they are both clear.  I take medication as a support for the treatment I received.  Please try not to worry or your mum will worry too.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	Cancers can be cured if they are caught erly enough, but there are some cancers that are developing without showing. prostrate cancer, and thyroid cancer are 2 examples. These cancers are not visible for some time until people feel uncomfortable enought to see the Doctor. people with Thyroid cancer have symptoms of laryngitis, andd think it wil eventually go away. By the time they seee the Doctor, the cancer can be terminal.|`|1a195e834f21aad260c9607f401e83c4aa	Yeah I agree it is a cure for cancer.|`|fNgv2FeRaa	No as it isn't strong enough..Jade Goody had radiotherapy but she is still dying.|`|rFXt8ygGaa	my mam had te same but it spread to her glans she had all that treatment ya she is cured

1oBilGHuaa	It's hard because if we lie we have to remember our lies so that we tell the same story next time around.

1accebcfa5f7af07e3721c9f3d2645cbaa	Nothing to worry about. Electrodes(sticky pads that are connected to wires) are put on your chest arms and legs. Electrical impulses from the heart show up as your heart beat on paper. The doc. can look at it to show various things such as the rate and any irregularities. It is usually done if the patient complains of chest pain or if they feel like their heart palpitates or races. It is also done after a certain age as part of the yearly physical and before surgery.

uXP1Xij4aa	Depends what caused you to feel crappy. But generally you should not workout when you don't feel well.<br>  Medication you took only relieves symptoms not the cause.<br>  Many people died during a workout, because they had some underlying condition, or had something going on in their body at the time of workout and their bodies could not take the higher blood pressure and higher heart rate in addition to the what was already going on in their bodies. You don't know what caused you to feel crappy, so you should not workout yet.<br>  Also, your body needs to recover from whatever caused you to feel crappy. If you workout too soon or when not completely well, your body may not handle all the recoveries your body needs, so your workout will be useless and even get the opposite effect.<br>  It's only during recovery that muscles rebuilt and body gets better.  Don't push it, wait, sleep and recover, then you will see that you will have more energy and better workout, and that will give you better results.<br>  It's a good time to rest and prepare mentally for the workout you will start after you get better. It always works better this way.|`|5yCdBRjiaa	try not to do any type of hard lifting that you do not do every day just in case you faint or anything like that.

IKakoOfyaa	No, I don't believe they are required to report them, but it will be noted in your medical record that the injury occurred at work.  If that information gets to your insurance company, they may opt not to cover your claim if they feel it should be covered by workman's compensation.  You could also run into a problem if your doctor is your company's doctor, but you can tell him you wish to take care of the treatment personally and not have it reported as a work-comp claim.

AekVyLneaa	1.  Not everyone's body is the same, therefore not everyone's lungs are going to react the same to smoking.  While only a few of them get cancer, pretty much 70-80% if not more of those remainder smokers get something such as COPD, which is almost as bad as cancer.<br>  <br>  2.I don't know about the 30-50%.  In my experience, it is much much much much higher than that. Statistics aren't always very accurate.  I believe that some lung related illnesses do go undetected.  Some people just flat out refuse to go to the Dr. and live with lung disease, therefore they are never diagnosed with it.<br>  <br>  3. There is no set amount.  It differs for everyone.  Some of my patients have only smoked 1/2 a pack a day for 30 years while others have smoked 3 packs a day for 40 years.|`|NfB9kpFraa	I'll smoke another till i answer your question, sorry.

Not  only a smoker can develope lungs cancer , any one inhale or expose to Carbon di oxide or any other such toxic gases for  a long period of time (years) can cause the problem . all because Increase in Co2 in the blood is the reason. Alveoloar capillary membrane in the lungs cant do the gases exchange ( take o2 in  pull out co2 out ).<br>  <br>   like u said some people dont hve any issues with lungs if they being smokers for 30 + year , well we guys dont have 100% correct answer for it .

Drink NO sodas.. not even diet ones they still can give you gas and bloating<br>  <br>  - Switch to brown! That means trade white brea, white rice, white paste t brown pasta, bread and rice.<br>  <br>  - Use no oil in cooking, oven cook everything<br>  <br>  - become more active.. move around a lot more.. for example don't ask someone to pass you the remote get up and get it your self.. run, swim, play wii ( standing up ) do what ever you can to burn calories..<br>  <br>  - Make your meals smaller, half them from your original size..<br>  <br>  - Avoid alllll fast foods.. its terrible for you its full of oil and salt and its the reason why over 50% over Americans are overweight.<br>  <br>  - Go organic or Vegetarian.. When i went vegetarian a few -pounds dropped in weeks without me even trying.<br>  <br>  - Sleep More - The more sleep you get the more your body burns fat.. when your sleeping your body prepares its self.<br>  <br>  - Bring a notebook and pen around with you and write everything you eat, it reallly helps<br>  <br>  - Be determined and motivated without having belief you will never get to where you want to be.. push yourself until you feel happy with your body.<br>  <br>  - Do not eat boxed foods ( ready made mac and cheese and stuff like that ) these foods contains loads of salt and are really bad for you.<br>  <br>  - Get low fat everything ! when you go grocery shopping buy low fat cheese, mayonnaise, ketchups ect..<br>  <br>  - Do not eat two hours before you go to bed.. if you eat and then go straight to sleep, your body will convert the food you ate into fat rather than using it right away as fuel. Ultimately, you'll gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid:<br>  Any sort of potato chips, even the low-fat ones.<br>  All candy.<br>  All soda, including Diet soda, because it retains water.<br>  Bananas (in excess) They are high in calories.<br>  Butter (in excess)<br>  Oil (in excess) (Try to boil most foods, it REALLY shaves off a lot of fats in your food!)<br>  Nuts (in excess) High in calories.<br>  Bread<br>  Pasta<br>  Rice<br>  Meats (excluding fish, because fish is very healthy)<br>  <br>  Eat lots of:<br>  Fruits, specifically apples and oranges, because they are great-tasting and very low in calories.<br>  Vegetables, especially the following: Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Onion, Hot Peppers. These veggies are called "Negative Calorie" because it takes more calories to digest them than the amount of calories it has in them to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  The way I got rid of belly fat was doing 50 push ups a night, and 50 sit ups. and doing the hula hoop. i lost loads of belly fat and toned up and the best thing was i started to notice results just in the first week or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Remember to drink LOTS of water, as it helps with digestion and helps to flush away toxins and bacteria that could cause your body to retain fat.|`|AA12074512	your  on the write track .just eat less and go to the gym. that's  all you can do.|`|pX5t30NSaa	Exercise is just as pivotal as food consumption when it comes to losing weight, but the one thing which really showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Fox News and USA Today.

NAGiNKFWaa	See if your gyn can do an ultra sound.  You get a cyst on your ovary and when you have your period, the cyst is supposed to dissolve.  Well my body doesn't do that.  So I had 7 cyst on my ovary.  I have to have  a strong birth control pill to dissolve the cyst, because my body doesn't do it for me.  I would suggest avoiding chocolate or anything with caffeine, and drinking lots of water or gatorade.  I know you don't believe in birth control, but I think they allow it in your church if it is for medical reasons.  I am not sure if this is what is wrong with you, or if they have some other way of treating things these days.  Lasers can do all kinds of things these days.

hjQyoPGuaa	From what you've written above I don't think you have an eating disorder, I generally think that you have a small appetite. However, I do think that perhaps you should stop eating 'crap' during the day, This will mean that you will feel more hungry during the routine meals. Your body needs routine so by feeding it junk you will just be making things worse. This will mean that your parents will also see you eating more at the dinner table. <br>  I don't think that you should wait to eat until your stomach starts to hurt, I'm sure that's not healthy, that may be worrying your parents.<br>  <br>  I would recommend talking to your parents about this, and tell them how you feel about them making you feel as if you have a disorder. <br>  <br>  I'm no doctor so perhaps a trip to a nutritionist would be a good idea.<br>  <br>  Hope u resolve your problem|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	There are always two sides to every story, but quit eating the junk and eat a healthy meal at dinner. actions speak louder than words and if you lost a lot of weight and don't need to then you are probably in denial that you have a problem or your stomach ache is a sign of something else going on medically.|`|wPXLu1zaaa	whenever you eat try to eat in front of them. and tell them that you would finish the dinner but you feel like the portions are too big and you get a stomach ache. good luck|`|SbPW2ZVeaa	Stop eating crap during the day.

Afraid of sounding silly, frightened, nervous... Can I put the teacher's point of view to you? They are in that job (mostly) because they want to pass their knowledge on to young people. That's quite admirable. What they would like is someone who has done a little study in between lessons. Don't take this wrong, I'm not having a go at you. You've had some good advice so far: prepare a little and be the first to speak or ask a question. If it's only a couple of teachers who have this effect on you, can you see them after class? Maybe they'll be gentler, will understand your struggle too.<br>  <br>  Also I don't believe 'faking it' helps you feel confident because ultimately it's not 'you' and it therefore won't last long. <br>  <br>  So what are your better subjects? What are you good at? What do you like about school? Do the awful lessons take up the majority of hours in the day? I hope not. One thing you could try is get to be an expert in something. Of the history of films or seahorses or Dickens's domestic life or something equally obscure. Then offer it to the relevant class - this will work wonders for your confidence, I promise!|`|liAcHx7Aaa	no.1- don't be ashamed to get answers wrong!!<br>  <br>  no.2- do some research of things u are learning about before lesson<br>  <br>  no 3- confide in a teacher about your low self esteem...be good if you confide in a teacher you don't like as she/ he will stop being a "prick" to u..and many advantages will come along with it.<br>  <br>  sometimes teachers mistake being shy for being rude/lazy.<br>  <br>  no.4..take chances...the first time you are going to do something confident is going to be really hard...and you will hesitate but just don't think and go for it...and after that it will be smooth sailing for You!!<br>  <br>  <br>  i'm only 15 and used to have confidence issues and trust me when u gain confidence lifes a lot better.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|fJ7OeopSaa	well i think a lot of people have this problem, you need to act confident, head high, shoulders back, smile on your face then you will start to feel confident. if you are unsure of an answer just start with "is it..." or "er..then your answer" I always used to and it never seems as bad if you are wrong because you were not sure in the first place and if its right its a great feeling.

Hope this helps you x|`|IMpG8LRlaa	Alright my teacher in high school gave me a little piece of advice that I think might help u a lot... however, in my instance it was because I didn't do the hw but i think it will help regardless. Pick something from the reading, a quote, a caption or anything. Be the first to speak in class once it has started, for instance "how did you feel when the protagonist found Dracula's palace?" the teacher will then defer to other students about the question that you raised taking attention off of you but all the while putting in your teacher's mind that you are an ample participant to the class. Hope this helps, I can't make you hate the lessons any less but maybe this takes a little of the pressure off.|`|SziirjXaaa	just know that every question you are unsure of, i guarantee there are others with the same uncertainties.

Next thing, we knew she was in a coma due to meningitis. Make sure you are eating enough to because you can suppress your immune system, making it easier to get viruses and infections. And if you still keep passing out, get your head looked at. A girl who was in another sorority at my college died due to encephalitis, swelling of the brain. Not trying to scare you, or act like a hypochondriac. But like the doctor said, it is not something to be taken lightly.

They indicate and detect many abnormalities within the heart though.<br>  <br>  The most common use of ECG's are to detect abnormal heart rhythms. The ECG basically records the electrical activity of the heart, detecting electrical impulses which the heart produce that spread through the heart muscle- making the heart contract. <br>  <br>  Different heart problems produce different patterns. The most common that are detected with the ECG are abnormal heart rhythms, an enlarged heart and recent heart attack.  An ECG will not rule out serious heart disease. They can detect certain electrical patterns that can suggest Coronary artery disease, but they are never conclusive. The ECG will also show the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of your heart.<br>  <br>  To diagnose CAD, the cardiologist will generally listen to your aterties for any abnormal sounds or what we call a 'bruit' sound, this can indicate poor blood flow due to plaque build up in the arteries. If needed an echocardiography test will also be done, angiography, exercise test and sometimes a PET scan. Blood work is also used to determine evels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood- all which can indicate risk of heart disease.|`|So7lXdBKaa	it tells how well your heart is functioning  by testing the heart electro impulses this is done by placing electrode on pulse points around your body . it is totally painless  and the results are printed out on a receipt type page  it tells how well your heart is and how well the blood flow is True your arteries it will show up disease and abnormal heart activity  ECG test is sometimes done with a stress test  where you walk or run on a tread mill to show a reading when your heart is under pressure and your body is being stressed,|`|OXqLsFYxaa	It shows your heart rhythm, electo pulse, the pop a few probes on your chest and attach leads, but it doesnt hurt, you just lie there for a few mins, thats it, if you are worried, get an ECHO done, this is how they found out that i had Aortic stenosis, ECG wont show this, it will show murmurs though.|`|BV1Y6yYIaa	doctor can "read" the tracing and spot potential problems like irregular heart beat, which could in time cause various other problems.<br>  can also show if someone has had a heart attack!
X7DDlR1caa	sounds to me like you've either fractured it or broke it (theres so many bones in your feet, 26 as a matter of fact and 19 of them are in your toes!) Fractures of the toe and metatarsal bones (broken toes) are common and require evaluation by a specialist. A foot and ankle surgeon should be seen for proper diagnosis and treatment, even if initial treatment has been received in an emergency room,<br>  <br>  <br>  Stress Fractures<br>  Stress fractures are tiny, hairline breaks that are usually caused by repetitive stress. Stress fractures often afflict athletes who, for example, too rapidly increase their running mileage. Or they may be caused by an abnormal foot structure, deformities, or osteoporosis. Improper footwear may also lead to stress fractures. Stress fractures should not be ignored, because they will come back unless properly treated. Symptoms of stress fractures include:<br>  <br>      * Pain with or after normal activity<br>      * Pain that goes away when resting and then returns when standing or during activity<br>      * "Pinpoint pain" (pain at the site of the fracture) when touched<br>      * Swelling, but no bruising|`|qGQUZM90aa	FRACTURES....

As well as finding good products, make sure you aren't always covering your face with your hands/hair - when I had awful acne as a teenager, I would try to hide it by wearing my hair more in my face, but the thing is, that will get it more oily. Try not to touch your blemishes or your face. No matter what you end up buying, make sure you wash your face good in the morning and at night. Make sure you wash your pillow cases regularly. I used Phisohex growing up and that helped. Accutane was the best but it was expensive and it initially made things WAY worse. If you can live with looking really bad for a few weeks, I would recommend that (but it's not over the counter).

icgTII3Maa	There are no known adverse interactions between plaquenil and methotrexate, therefore it is safe to take together, although not simultaneously. However, with plaquenil and antacids, there is a moderate interaction wherein each may depress each individual action since they affect both their absorption in the body. It is suggested, especially if the benefits of taking them outweigh the moderate interaction that is caused, that the two medications be taken at least 2-4 hours apart to avoid them interacting with each other.

tVF9O1Olaa	I am not sure but i feel it is because these people (bullies) are so unhappy in their life that they want to make people feel the same low that they are feeling, it may almost make them feel better in their mind about themselves.<br>  If a child bullies then i think it is more they don't understand yet the consequences of their actions and how hurtful their words can be.<br>  <br>  I am not a professional but this is my opinion!|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	I designed an anti-bullying initiative while I was in university. There are actually a number of reasons why people pick on each other. They may be picking on someone because they are jealous of what that person has. They also may be afraid of the person that they are picking on for some reason, so they feel that they need to assert themselves to that person in a negative way. It also may have something to do with a home social situation. Often, those who bully do so because that's what they see happening in their home environment. One of their parents might be abusive physically or mentally. I hope this helps!|`|HZ1zLHhkaa	Because they are insecure or blowing off steam<br>  <br>  they also may have had a rough childhood or something or were picked on previously.<br>  <br>  thats all i can think of<br>  <br>  oh, or because they just dont like the person.|`|iHDdi3FUaa	well that is one of the problems ... they have problems in her life... also i think that they bully only because it makes them feel better about them selves.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|m3cf7vsAaa	it makes them feel better about themselves to put others down.

ZpG05jupaa	The McDonald's diet!|`|AE3lv4pRaa	I can tell you some great tips to gain weight:-<br>  <br>  1, Eat at least three well- balanced meals , including a healthy breakfast , and snacks throughout the day. For some people, it might be easier to eat smaller , more frequent meals than three larger meals.<br>  <br>  2,Eat hearty soups such as lentil , minestrone, split pea, or cream soups rather than broth. Make your canned soup with regular milk or evaporated milk instead of water and top it with Parmesan cheese and croutons.<br>  <br>  3 ,Nuts are high in fat and calories and make a good snack.<br>  <br>  4, Salads are low in calories but can be made more substantial by adding cheese or chickpeas or even sunflower seeds or raisins.<br>  <br>  5,Choose desserts that have nutritional value but also are high in calories. Puddings, sweet breads such as banana bread or carrot muffins , ice cream , oatmeal cookies all make the grade.<br>  <br>  6, Eat cereals with added fruits or nuts instead of the puffed varieties. Make cooked cereal with milk instead of water.<br>  <br>  7, Add powdered milk to puddings, baked gods, milk shakes and mashed potatoes.<br>  <br>  8,Dried fruits such as raisins , dates, prunes or dried apricots are high in calories and can be eaten as a snack or added to cereal or in baking.<br>  <br>  9,To boost calories and protein of a glass of milk , add a bit of milk powder to your regular milk.<br>  <br>  10, Don’t let anyone talk you into taking any supplement that are ‘’ guaranteed to put on weight ‘’.

Sugar, fat, etc.|`|FWUSLQN2aa	eat what your eating now, and throw in those protein bars, but then again they could make you gain muscle instead since you do a lot of dance, throw in more starches and cut back a bit on veggies, dont cut the fat off your red meat, cut back on fish, it's a lean protein. eat only every now and then. its really hard to say cause you dont want to get to greasy or sweet, cause it will make you feel lousy, and you wont feel like getting up to do stuff. but what i said at first is a good way to start, lower your fruit and veggie intake verses potatoes as a side, carbs, and meats, go for wheat products, they give you more energy and stay in your system longer, also make smothies as a snack, not any special protein or anything like that, just yogurt, red milk, and fresh fruit. hope i helped.
6ZZAvyHNaa	I had (and have it again) the same problem. <br>  It seems to only come around in winter, because your finger nails are weaker and brake easier and the skin around the nails is dry.<br>  <br>  How I was able to stop, was that I got my nails (my real nails, not fake nails) painted really pretty by friends or myself, like I painted pretty flowers that took a long time to make.<br>  This helps because you won't want to chew it off, the nail art reminds you to stop biting your nails.<br>  <br>  I also bought this liquid that is purpisly made to put on your finger nails (bought anywhere, like drugstore) to make you stop biting because the liquid has a really bad taste to it. In a way, i recomand this because it taste really nasty, but in another way, i don't recommant this because I tasted the liquid everytime I ate during the day and whenever I put my fingers in my mouth (and very embarassing when my boyfriend ''kissed and licked'' my nasty tasting fingers lol.<br>  <br>  Another tip that I suggest with painting your nails all pretty and get used to put good hand lotion on. Try not to get those ''girly'' hand lotion that has mostly water in it, cause it'll dry up your hands even more. I suggest Aveeno hand lotion because it keeps your hands and ''nail skin'' very moisturized.<br>  <br>  When your skin and riped or peeled, but still stuck on your finger, try cutting it off with a ''nail cutter'' (wow, is that the name of that tool?) you know what i mean, the nail cutter, the tool to use to cut nails, the tool that everyone has....lol... well cutting the skin is better then ripping it off or biting it off.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|L1LRQMwWaa	Don't worry i have a problem with scratching at my arms.

I went through severe withdrawal symptoms for 6 months, but after that it was "duck soup".  <br>  You are lucky because what you do is not chemically addictive, like smoking is, so you will not suffer any withdrawal symptoms.     This will be a test of your ability to focus on good mental health because what you are doing is a form of Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder and can lead to other, more serious forms of aberrance.   Good Luck and whenEVER you look at your fingers, think of what I have said and say to yourself: "NO WAY JOSE, 'cause Don is Pulling for me".   And I am.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|tIldpr7vaa	a good diet and cardio are how u do it<br>  <br>  limit calories and carbs ( complex carbs)  and avoid simple carbs and all sugars<br>  <br>  do lots of cardio, jogging works great. 25-35 mins a day 4-5 days a week|`|AA10895799	If U are going to work every day, U can make enough money to get a consultation from a trainer at the Y or at a gym.

Were it me I would start talking with the people who work with more than bruised bones, hang nails and the occasional sunburn. Please get in touch with a real medical professional. <br>  Do yourself a favor: Demand answers to your questions from the medical people you see. You are deserving of an answer even if it is "I don't know". Your answer to this should be "OK, then let's find out!, today would be nice!" I urge you to push the issue, something is not right.
wzM5WB8Xaa	Love is something that you can't just turn off. Sometimes being absent can make you want that person even more, because you miss him. Being in an abusive relationship is not going to be good for you, and taking him back is only going to encourage his belief that he can get away with whatever he wants with you. Believe me, you don't want this to happen. You really need to fill your time with friends and family instead of him. Remind yourself of why you decided to break up with him in the first place. If you really feel that you need him in your life, than you need to limit your relationship to friendship.|`|lITolEVJaa	I'm not sure WHY you are addicted to this relationship, but I CAN tell you how to slowly let go of him. First what you need to do is what a few other people above me said: write a list of things that he as done to you and focus on that. Then, cut off all contact with him. When he calls, don't answer. When he texts, don't back. You don't try to contact him. When any of this happens, if you think that you are too weak to just avoid it, then go away and do something else to fill your time. Like someone else said, fill your time with family and friends and ones that you love instead of him. It will keep your mind off of him. You HAVE taken the first step by admitting that you have a problem and asking for help about it. That's a good thing. Just listen to the people on here and go from there. Stay strong!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|ajOlzSJ1aa	Remind yourself of the reasons you wanted to leave the relationship, focus on those, be strong, and then when you meet someone else, ( or not as the case may be!) you will really wake up and smell the coffee, and be so glad you did it.|`|Tn4WQMA5aa	You have done the right think ,you know you have done question yourself Be strong dont contact him write down everything hes done to you and the reasons why you shouldnt be together and when u feel week read them.Delete his number or buy a new sim|`|oJTxk2cDaa	It is familiar to you, you crave the contact not the person and this is a hard thing to break from.  You know it is not for you, yet you go back for more through habit.  You need to look at him from a different angle, instead of all the good things you have shared.  Focus on the bad and you will see that you get out of your comfort zone, otherwise you will destroy your own self belief.  Make a conscious effort to stay away and not to let him back into your life.
tXmu16Niaa	Wow!  That is not really healthy, but if you really want to know, this is what my friend did for a wedding that she was a bridesmaid in.  She lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks.  Just cut out processed sugar, breads, anything white (potatoes, rice, etc.) and only eat fruits and lean meats (turkey, chicken breasts, etc.).  I think she occasionally had string cheese.  She, of course, exercised everyday, which meant she walked two or three miles.  I really don't recommend doing this, but if you must.

It's not healthy. When you lose weight that quickly it can cause major stress on your body, and you are also more likely to gain the weight back because when you stop eating, it just slows down your metabolism. If you want to lose weight, shoot for losing about 2 or 3 pounds per week. You can do this by moderating your eating habits (smaller portions, cutting out some excess snacking, etc.) and adding some moderate exercise. If you don't have time to fully work out, fit in physical activity where you can. Park farther away from work, or the supermarket, to get a little extra walking in. Try taking a short walk during your lunch break if you have one. Do a few crunches or sit ups in the morning when you wake up, or at night before you go to sleep. Call a friend on your day off, and take a long walk while you catch up on each others lives. Good luck.|`|9ewRarFuaa	its impossible to do that safely, but you can lose like 10 pounds in 2 weeks if you excersize a LOT and only eat a little every day, all healthy.|`|UEHsqSaTaa	It's impossible.

If you didn't report the incident to your supervisor, and they didn't file a report, then it's your issue as you have no proof that it occurred in the workplace. Your employer's insurance company and the worker's compensation board is only going to pay if there was a proper report filed and they have proof it was work related. They always look for proof as they have many, many cases of people filing for benefits that they're not entitled to.

Your body seems to be stocking what you eat.<br>  <br>  When this happen we need to change diet to make the weight loss restart again.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should stop running and weight lift for a while and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Regarding diet, you could try a low-fat diet so that your body uses its own fat.<br>  <br>  How to determine the number of calories you need. I recommend for the average person the following simple "rule of thumb" method:<br>  <br>  For: MARKED OVERWEIGHTS<br>  A person markedly overweight is one who is 30 per cent or more above his normal weight. This means that if you weigh 180 lbs. but should, according to our table, weigh 135 lbs., then you are 45 lbs, overweight. In that case you should reduce your weight by using the 800 calorie diet menus.<br>  <br>  For: MODERATE OVERWEIGHTS <br>  If you are moderately overweight (i.e. 15-30 per cent; you are, say, 20 to 45 lbs. over and weigh from 155 to 180 lbs.) use the diet menus for the 1000 calorie daily food intake <br>  <br>  For: MILD OVERWEIGHTS<br>  If you are only mildly overweight (5 to 15 per cent above your normal weight; let us say you are 7 to 20 lbs. over.) then follow the 1200 calorie diet described in the center, green section.<br>  <br>  After you have lost an average of 2 lbs. each week and have achieved your normal weight, you should then follow the low-fat maintenance diets. These diets range from approximately 1500 calories to 2200 calories. They are recommended for the average individual who does light work with a moderate expenditure of calories in average daily activities|`|qgDCcNQqaa	You probably have lost weight but need to tone up.<br>  Also dry brushing your skin in gentle circular motions helps break up fat near the surface of the skin, so try that to get rid of cellulite.<br>  Your diet and fitness regime sounds really good so stick to that as well as trying to tone up.<br>  Crunches + sit ups for abs.<br>  There's this thing you can get and you put it in between your thighs and squeeze it which tones up your thighs and you can really feel the burn lol|`|AA10895799	Too much to read!

IM3QwSS2aa	using herbal supplements<br>  using a c?ckring and leaving on during 'magic moment."|`|TsjqzanQaa	What has vastly increased the pleasure during sex in my case was restoring my foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is a necessary part of the penis for the maximum sensitivity and enjoyment of sex.<br>  <br>  It keeps the glans and surrounding tissues moist and sensitive, and in itself has thousands of nerve endings.<br>  <br>  Circumcision always damages the penis and destroys sexual sensitivity.       The foreskin with its thousands of nerve endings is amputated, blood vessels, veins and capillaries are severed, permanently disrupting the normal penile blood flow, and scar tissue is formed.<br>  <br>  The exposed glans and surrounding tissues meant by nature to be covered are exposed, and they dry out and keratinize.<br>  <br>  This diminishes sexual sensitivity on average of 50-75% and more in some cases.<br>  <br>  Obviously, anyone with intelligence can see that a whole penis, natural and normal with a foreskin, feels and functions better than one that's been made partial, mutilated and scarred by circumcision.<br>  <br>  Restoring my foreskin has vastly increased sexual sensitivity and even the intensity of orgasms.    The new foreskin is especially sensitive, adding a new dimension to sexual feeling that circumcised men don't have, and the motion of the foreskin adds to the enjoyment of both partners.<br>  <br>  This is the most beneficial way that I know of to increase the enjoyment of sex, the way that nature intended.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|PWpSCeRcaa	1) Prostate Massage<br>  2) Roleplaying (e.g BDSM,Rape, and other fetishes)<br>  3) Dirty Talking

Also bath your dog with anti-dandruff shampoo. Also vacuuming daily also helps. Brushing the dog at least twice a week helps also. Good luck and get some allergy medicine.

This may lead to decreased libido (interest in sex) and impotence. An increased risk of infertility may result from changes in semen characteristics seen with marijuana smoking.<br>  <br>  In women, chronic pot use causes shorter menstrual cycles and increased prolactin levels which may impair fertility.<br>  <br>  if you are a chronic user you may have withdrawal symptoms after abrupt cessation. Marijuana withdrawal begins within ten hours of the last dose and consists of irritability, agitation, depression, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, and tremor. Most symptoms peak in 48 hours and last for five to seven days. Some symptoms, such as unusual dreams and irritability, can last for weeks.<br>  <br>  Marijuana is not smoked with filters, unlike most cigarettes. Marijuana smoke contains nearly four times as much tar and 50 percent more carcinogens than tobacco.<br>  <br>  Here is what complicates the question of smoking pot and lung cancer: marijuana users are five times more likely to smoke cigarettes than non-users. Use of nicotine and marijuana together likely enhance the harmful effects of each used independently.<br>  <br>  It should be reassuring for pot smokers that although they are probably at increased risk for lung cancer, the magnitude of risk has not been well quantified. A review of 19 studies did NOT detect a significant association between lung cancer and marijuana use, after adjusting for tobacco smoking.|`|bPnxxSZjaa	Long term effects, I don't know.<br>  But in the short term, I'd be surprised if your brother's friend hasn't already died.

SkDomhoXaa	Antipsychotic medications have been used to treat a variety of behavioral and psychiatric disturbances in persons with mental retardation. Given the well-documented side effects of traditional antipsychotics, newer atypical antipsychotics have been well received in this population due to initial reports of a more favorable side effect profile. We compared the side effect profiles of both the typical and atypical antipsychotics using a comprehensive instrument, the Matson Evaluation of Drug Side Effects (MEDS) scale. Participants taking atypical antipsychotics did not differ in overall side effects from a matched control group taking no psychotropic medication, and both groups showed significantly fewer overall side effects than participants taking typical antipsychotics. Subscales designed to measure involuntary movements (e.g., akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) detected differences between participants taking either atypical or typical antipsychotics with respect to akathisia only. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.<br>  <br>  no they do not make the person depressed but the are usually used along side anti depressants.|`|d8h5h8IVaa	Yes.  My good friend was prescribed them by his therapist for having MINOR depression and they made him way more depressed.  We are talking about a smart, talented, nice guy, who had a breakdown because the drugs made him feel so wierd.<br>  <br>  He is now off them and better than before.  Think about all the people who took these kind of drugs and went crazy.  Phil Hartman's wife shot him after mixing her Zoloft with alcohol, and there was the wrestler who shot his wife and kids after taking a high dose.  Even that monkey in Connecticut that attacked that poor woman was given Xanax before he freaked out.<br>  <br>  I would try natural remedies before going to drugs, the side effects alone will make you crazy, (NO ORGASM?!)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xUcjzYPdaa	Anti-psychotic drugs aren't usually depressants. In fact, some work well at relieving depression.<br>  <br>  Anti-psychotic drugs are primarily used to treat psychosis. However, they are also sometimes prescribed for mood disorders.<br>  <br>  I have bipolar disorder, and was at different times prescribed aripiprazole and olanzapine. Both of these medications worked very well at preventing me from becoming manic, but in my case they didn't relieve my depression. So, whilst they didn't make me depressed, they took away the only other mood I had and so consequently I was depressed all of the time.<br>  <br>  These medications have numerous possible side effects, which you can find by googling some individual medications.<br>  <br>  Serious psychiatric illnesses need to be medicated. I think encouraging people to cope alone is dangerous. By all means use herbal supplements and exercise etc. as complementary therapy, but don't let it be your only support. Psychiatric illness is illness like any other.

ufgv7oTjaa	Your best (and safest) bet would be to ask a pharmacist if there are any interactions listed between the drugs and supplements you're taking. Doctors and pharmacists both have access to a database of drug and supplement interactions and they can tell you quickly if you can safely take them together or not.... anyone here will just have a best guess from searching on the internet (which isn't always accurate, as we all know) ;-) <br>  As you've already seen, there are already conflicting answers given... instead of trusting one random member over another, a professional with access to a verified database would be your best bet. Good luck!|`|DkFoX4pHaa	You can take anything with anything;  as long as you blame only yourself  for the consequences and have no wish to live a long and fruitful life. <br>  Adios muchachos.|`|LMoJl7hFaa	Talk to your pharmacist and have him check.

MhpccWpmaa	No matter how you do it, he needs to know.  You could try easing into the subject, start talking about past sexual activity and ask him his opinions on similar topics.  Or you could just lay it on him, although this may leave him in shock.  It's extremely early in your relationship so I hope you two aren't already sexually active.  But if so he needs to be tested.  Since you haven't been together for long, he may not stay with you.  If he is really into you, he may stay with you and try to work it out.  But you have to understand that if he leaves you, it's not because he doesn't like you, it's because he doesn't want to put his self at risk.  Living with genital warts can be a heartbreaking and stressful ordeal and my heart goes out to you, but don't leave any future prospective partners in the dark|`|cSaVqUDdaa	being honest is the key. dont hide it from him<br>  tell him up front. if he cant accept that then so be it.<br>  <br>  at least you can say i was 100% real with you from the start.<br>  <br>  Genital warts is caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV itself is not curable yet, however if a persons immune system is in tip-top shape, their own body can fight off the virus. Genital warts are curable and can be removed from a doctor. The doctor will usually burn them off. However, since HPV is not curable, the warts can come back.|`|iWoNMj57aa	If your boyfriend cares about you, he will understand that it isn't about the STD, its about the relationship, he can use protection to make sure he doesn't get it, make sure to use medication properly, and tell anyone that you are going to have intercourse with that you have genital warts so they know to use protection. <br>  <br>  Also, you will have to tell your doctor all the names of the men you have slept with in the last little while so they can be checked.<br>  Nothing is worse than not knowing..<br>  Good luck.|`|Bc8CygPIaa	So have you had sex with others?

AA10766729	I had a total perforation with the Mirena, and that required emergency surgery (because it was tearing up my intestines).  <br>  <br>  It definitely sounds like something's gone awry.  They'll probably do an ultrasound to figure out where the IUD is situated, and will probably try a trans-vaginal non-dilated extraction (they'll insert forceps through the cervix and try to grasp the IUD and pull it out).  It's not pleasant from what I hear, but there ARE worse things, as I well know.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
yj3GT7jOaa	Warm compress on a regular bases.  Allow it come to a head on it's own.  Do not force it, that may cause an infection and will leave a scar.  The warm compress will allow the area to heal from within as the blackhead works it way out.
3QIWdvG1aa	Appendicitis is one of the causes of serious belly pain. It happens when the appendix, a part of the large intestine, becomes infected and inflamed. Experts do not know what the appendix does in the body, but most of the time it does not cause problems.<br>  <br>  About 8 out of 100 people will get appendicitis sometime during their lives. It is most common in people ages 10 to 30, but it can happen at any age.<br>  What causes appendicitis?<br>  <br>  It is not clear why people get appendicitis. Infection in the appendix causes appendicitis. But doctors and scientists are not sure what causes the infection. In many cases, a small object (such as a hard piece of stool) blocks the opening to the appendix. Then bacteria can grow in the appendix and cause an infection.<br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  The main symptom of appendicitis is belly pain. Many people feel the first pain near the belly button. Then it moves to the lower right side of the belly. But the pain can be in different parts of your belly or even on your side or back. The pain may get worse if you move, walk, or cough. You may also have a fever or feel sick to your stomach.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the only symptom is a general feeling of not being well and a pain that is hard to describe. The pain in your belly may be different than any pain you have had before. It may be severe. Or it may not seem like a very strong pain, but you may have the feeling that something is wrong. Trust your instincts.<br>  <br>  Because the diagnosis is not always easy to make, it is very important to see a doctor as soon as possible if you have symptoms.<br>  <br>  In some cases, appendicitis does not cause any symptoms except for belly pain. If you have moderate belly pain that does not go away after 4 hours, call your doctor. If you have severe belly pain, call your doctor right away.<br>  How is appendicitis diagnosed?<br>  <br>  Your doctor will ask you questions about what symptoms you have, when they started, and what was happening before the pain began. Your doctor will press on your belly to see where the pain is. He or she will take your temperature to see if you have a fever, which is a sign of infection. You also may have blood tests to look for signs of infection.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may not be sure whether you have appendicitis. You may need other tests, such as a CT scan or an ultrasound of your belly.<br>  <br>  Sometimes tests can't show for certain that you have appendicitis, but your doctor may strongly suspect that you do because of your symptoms. In this case, your doctor probably will recommend you have surgery to have your appendix taken out. Most of the time, the doctor is right and the appendix is infected. During surgery your doctor may find that your appendix is normal and something else caused your pain. Your doctor will go ahead and remove your appendix. You can live just fine without it, and taking it out gets rid of any chance that it could cause problems later.<br>  How is it treated?<br>  <br>  The only treatment for appendicitis is surgery to remove your appendix (appendectomy). If you have appendicitis and do not have surgery in time, your appendix can burst. A burst appendix can cause serious problems. It’s best to remove the appendix before it bursts.<br>  <br>  There are different types of surgery for appendicitis. Your surgeon may operate through a large cut (incision) in your belly or use a tool called a laparoscope to remove your appendix through a few smaller incisions. Either way, you may take antibiotics before your surgery, after your surgery, or both. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of surgery. Talk with your surgeon about which type is best for you.<br>  <br>  If your appendix does burst, you will need antibiotics. Surgery to remove a burst appendix may be more complicated.|`|WadzK6ejaa	No ,not necessary .it is not an inherited disease|`|BLHVMuCdaa	Well it's not a hereditary thing.  Anyone can get it at any time.  I had mine done last  May at 46.  It's just something that happens.  Many many people live full lives and never have to have it done.  It's nothing to worry about...you can still live to be old and gray if you have to have it done.
4jXDFlRfaa	No, they aren't complex enough to detect masking agents, or "detox drinks".  They simply contain a chemical that reacts to certain THC metabolites.  If they aren't there (meaning the drink worked), then they will not react, and you'll get a negative sign.  However, there is the possibility that they DON'T work, and in that case, you will fail.  The only thing you have to worry about is the drink not working and you failing like normal.  And trust me, it happens.  I failed a drug test today because the drink didn't work.  I've used a ton of products because I am on probation, and the most consistent one has failed me probably 3-4 times total in 4 years.
688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	I know how you feel.  It's not because of something you did or did not eat while you were pregnant.  I am pondering whether it's the fact that I started him on solids when he was 4 months old (per docs advice).  Some studies are showing that introducing solid foods increases risk.  But it's not yet confirmed for sure.<br>  <br>  I also noticed that when I was pregnant, eggs made me really sick.  And I normally eat them with no problem, before and after pregnancy.   I find it interesting that my son ended up being HIGHLY allergic to eggs.  I can't help but wonder if that was his little system getting me sick.<br>  <br>  At any rate.  It's still a mystery.  But until it's solved, I always tell people to wait as long as possible to introduce solids.  Why take a chance?|`|Z03zgM0maa	It's genetic and can be completely random because of a mutation. It is possible that maybe if you didn't eat a lot of grains or dairy, your son became susceptible to be allergic to it. I am allergic to pollen like my mom. But my younger siblings are not. I know my mom did not go outside a lot so maybe that could be why I have allergies every spring. I have gradually become more immune to it as I grew up. I'm not too sure about food allergies though. Allergies are annoying but even researchers don't know too much about why it happens. Most likely it is genetic, but could be random. Allergies are caused because your body is overreacting towards something it thinks is harmful even if it is not. Best idea is to always read ingredients. I don't think there is any cure for it.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Your heart is basically maxing out when you exercise. Most people use the 220- age formula to assess their maximum heart rate. <br>  <br>  220 - 39 = 181. You are slightly above that. I wouldn't say there is anything to be too concerned about. If you are concerned and/or you are experiencing any other symptoms- like chest pain etc then see your Doctor. He/she will arrange for you to have a cardiac stress test. This involves you using a treadmill whilst having your ECG monitored- this is the most accurate way to determine if you have a problem.<br>  <br>  The target heart rate zone is between 50-85% of your average maximum heart rate. So your target should be 90-153. This really indicates that you are not as fit as you should be. As I said above, providing you are not experiencing any other symptoms. There is no real cause for concern.|`|RvddYKqjaa	I would have some tests done to see why it goes that high, unless you are just starting out. I don't think anyone can tell you if you should be concerned. It's your heart. Do what's best for you.|`|ZjhQ6PL8aa	I'm not 100% sure if your saying it happens only when working out or not.  Regardless I'll provide answers for both.  <br>  <br>  Yes you should be concerned because there really is no reason for your heart to be that fast as the max heart rate for your age in working out is 181.  If your working out then you need to monitor your heart rate better so it stays between 50-85% of that max rate so it doesn't go over 154.  If your not working out and reach a heart rate of 183 it's called SVT which is an arrhythmia that requires medical intervention especially if it happens on a regular basis.

I wake up with a painful jaw every morning and it drives me mad, I used to take painkillers everyday but eventually I weaned myself off them and learned to cope. After about four months my dentist made me a nightguard to wear whilst I'm asleep because it is clenching and grinding during sleep that causes my TMJ dysfunction.<br>  <br>  TMJ can be caused by stress and can go away on it's own, but if it is really bad I would see a dentist.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	I have sort of the same problem, my jaw pops whenever I eat and sometimes when I talk.

But I lost more than ten pounds, just by eating better (I never counted calories, but I definitely cut out soda and stuck to water, that helps a lot), and doing beginner's Pilates daily. I know this sounds kind of silly, but a Pilates Weight Loss Workout for Dummies DVD helped me a lot. Just do it once a day in the comfort of your own home, and try to be more active by exercising in other ways as well. I can't garuntee you'll lose that much weight in 4 weeks, but you will start to notice some changes, like more engery, you'll feel better, and you'll lose weight in time.

bvt9kvS8aa	Eat healthier and cut down on junk food, such as replacing potato chips and chocolate with fruit. You'll see a world of difference.<br>  Watch how many soft drinks you consume. Consider flavored water as an alternative if you must.<br>  Do aerobic exercise daily at a 30 minute minimum and include 1-2 day(s) rest break each week. Anything that brings your heart rate up. Take up dancing, running,, tae-bo. (Power walking will only build your legs.)<br>  Eat lots of lean protein (like beans and nuts - have some meat, it is rather good for you as long as you do not eat the fat!), fruits and dark vegetables, and whole wheat breads and grains. They keep you fuller longer than white breads like in cakes, cookies, and sweets. Also, stay away from dairy products.<br>  To better work the entire abdominal region, vary your exercises: crunches work the upper abdomen; leg raises work the lower abdomen; side bends work the obliques (also known as love handles).<br>  It is better to aim at burning fat altogether since it is impossible to spot train. And sure, you can do 100 daily crunches. But if you've got a layer of fat covering up your ab work, then what's the point? You need to burn the stomach fat to see the changes.<br>  Consider some form of an-aerobic exercise, as well. Some simple resistance training, or light weight lifting, will not only help you burn fat more efficiently, but tone up the rest of your body as well.<br>  Raising your metabolic rate is crucial. The higher your metabolic rate, the more energy (and thus fat) you'll burn even when you aren't doing anything. Try compound exercises like deadlifts with heavier weights. See "How to Do a Deadlift" for more information.<br>  To increase your metabolic rate, increase the frequency of your meals to 6-8 times a day. Every 2 to 3 hours injest a small meal. This increased frequency, will put your metabolisim into overdrive. WARNING do not over-eat... small meals only. For greatest effect only eat carbohydrates before 2pm, from then on, only proteins.<br>  Do crunches every day. You must be consistant or else it won't work.

Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain.

But I also take Clonazepam to help me sleep at night because I have severe anxiety and I can literally stay up all night worrying about evey aspect of my life.

With a partner or by yourself.|`|5GntOFTnaa	Work on your sleep hygiene.  Go to bed at the same time each night. Wake up at the same time each morning regardless of whether you stayed up late the night before.  Get into a night time routine.  Example, watch some Tv for an hour then take a hot bath, read a book for 15 minutes and then go to bed.  Working out right before you go to bed is definately not a good idea because it gets your body all worked up when you should be relaxing.Do things that relax you before you go to bed.  Anxiety can keep you up at night.  Something that may really help you is journaling.  Write every thing down that is bothering you.  For some reason, if you write something down you are less likely to replay it over and over in your head.  Also, keep your planner by your bed.  If you are worried that you will forget an appointment or to pick up something after work you can write it down knowing that you have a reminder and won't keep replaying it in your head.  Lastly,lay down for 1/2 and hour.  If you can't sleep get up and do something relaxing such as a hot bath, meditation, reading a book, etc...  Do this for twenty minutes and then try lying back down again.  Best of luck to you.

If you workout right before, your adrenalin will be pumping, and it will be even harder to go to sleep.  Are you stressed out?  That causes me to think too much to go to sleep.  I read somewhere that if you can't get to sleep, you should get up for an hour or so and try again, rather than lying there.  Besides, if you get up at 8:00, it may be better to go to bed around 11:00-12:00. You're supposed to get sleep in increments of 3, either 3, 6, or 9 hours, so that your body goes through an entire R.E.M.  The whole eight hour thing is just an average.|`|SiPckd7Daa	Here's a serious answer....<br>  <br>  You feel like you can't stop thinking, and too much is popping into your mind?

hyHvG1Olaa	A lump in the soft tissue area is common and may be caused by many conditions.  Some of these conditions are:  a cyst, a tumor, a hernia, etc.<br>  <br>  It is best whenever anything of this nature occurs to see your family physician ASAP to rule out a dangerous condition.  Yes, it can be embarrassing but if it turns out to be something like a tumor remember there are two types, benign and cancerous.  The best rule is to have it checked and then sleep well at night and not worry all day.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, Good Luck ...|`|AOlNMMtEaa	could just b a cyst i had one still best 2 see the doctor tho|`|DkFoX4pHaa	Shyness about seeing a doctor has been the path to an early demise for many people but you must make absolutely sure that you do not join their ranks.

I went threw all this with my husband. He had a triple by pass three years ago, and this last December had his carotids done. Try a heating pad, baby aspirin, and ER. IF your husband is as stubborn as mine the ER might take some doing. But the life he saves may be his own.
0TGpz08paa	It is strongly recommended that you take what your doctor prescribed and the amount that your doctors prescribed. Taking 3 won't cause too much damage, you might feel very tired or nauseous, but that's about it. I took 70 of my seroquel pills once when I attempted suicide and I ended up being hospitalized for 9 weeks, so if you're feeling depressed, go see your doctor, because life is worth living|`|y9tMWuQjaa	It depends on the antidepressant some are stimulating and some are sedating (eg, for anxiety problems). <br>  <br>  Mine is the latter, sedating. It's called Trazodone. If I took three times my daily dose I'd probably sleep for a whole day. I take them at night, and can sleep for a good 10 hours!<br>  <br>  It's great though, because without them I can easily spend an entire night awake, desperately trying to sleep. I don't think I'd die from 3 though.|`|qKGbvKe6aa	if you take three it might not do much if you are a little on the heavy side. but it is not necessary to take that many. it's not like the more you take the faster it will work. some have to be taken at the same time and same amount for it to build up and begin to work. thats why it says to take for atleast three weeks|`|l8Ads0Blaa	overdose probaly depends on the chemical and the dosage|`|AA10976065	why would you take 3?

Putting the key in the hole is sex.|`|4m6vetjNaa	What are you 6?|`|bUmBLNjMaa	Yes. <br>  "Vaginal sexual intercourse, also called coitus, is the human form of copulation. While a purpose and effect is reproduction, it is often performed exclusively for pleasure and/or as an expression of love and emotional intimacy. Sexual intercourse typically plays a powerful bonding role; in many societies it is normal for couples to have frequent intercourse while using birth control, sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sex even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Sexual intercourse may also be defined as referring to other forms of insertive sexual behavior, such as oral sex and anal intercourse. The phrase to have sex can mean any or all of these behaviors, as well as other non-penetrative sex acts not considered here.<br>  <br>  Coitus may be preceded by foreplay, which leads to sexual arousal of the partners, resulting in the erection of the penis and natural lubrication of the vagina.<br>  <br>  To engage in coitus, the erect penis is inserted into the vagina and one or both of the partners move their hips to move the penis backward and forward inside the vagina to cause friction, typically without fully removing the penis. In this way, they stimulate themselves and each other, often continuing until orgasm in either or both partners is achieved. Penetration by the hardened erect penis is also known as intromission, or by the Latin name immissio penis (Latin for "insertion of the penis").<br>  <br>  Coitus is the basic reproductive method of humans. During ejaculation, which usually accompanies male orgasm, a series of muscular contractions delivers semen containing male gametes known as sperm cells or spermatozoa from the penis into the vagina.<br>  <br>  The subsequent route of the sperm from the vault of the vagina is through the cervix and into the uterus, and then into the fallopian tubes. Millions of sperm are present in each ejaculation, to increase the chances of one fertilizing an egg or ovum. When a fertile ovum from the female is present in the fallopian tubes, the male gamete joins with the ovum resulting in fertilization and the formation of a new embryo. When a fertilized ovum reaches the uterus, it becomes implanted in the lining of the uterus, known as endometrium and a pregnancy begins.<br>  <br>  Unlike most species, most human copulation takes place in private. Furthermore, human sexual activity is not linked to periods of estrus and can take place at any time during the reproductive cycle, even during pregnancy."- Wikipedia.<br>  <br>  And may i suggest that if you really didn't know that, that you are a bit too young to be using this site.|`|CWMaHHMFaa	The only thing I consider actual sex is when the penis goes into the vagina. Any thing else is fooling around. Oral sex,finger banging and hand jobs are used as pleasures to heighten the actual sexual experience.

8bQkJ2Zjaa	You will be fine, I would not worry...Diabetes is a very scary thing, but under control, you could live a long, healthy, happy life.<br>  <br>  I don't want to be mean or nasty-but these people answering so far know nothing about it-people loose their feet, go blind, neuropathy, kidney failure, coma, and even death...on that note, don't worry! LOL!<br>  <br>  Honestly-I am a diabetic, have been for 15 years. My father past away from it by having a diabetic heart attack. My grandfather had a foot taken off. My dad was blind in one eye and took a year to get an infection healed up from his foot. If he would have lived, he would have had it amputated as well. I have neuropathy (damaged nerves in my legs, feet, toes, fingers, hands, and even lips) for almost a year now, and I am only getting worse.<br>  <br>  At 19 you could have either type 1 or 2. If you are overweight, your chances of type 2 are greater, but most likely, your doctor is right and you may be a slow burner for type 1. If you ARE overweight, then type 2 can, perhaps, be cured by making sure you take your meds, and loosing the weight. However, if you have type 1, please be careful. Again, I am only 21, but I know a lot of what it has done to me. If I can give you a word of advice-either way BE CAREFUL, cut your carbs and sweets back (if not completely) and check your blood sugar as often as you can. As a result of my disease, I cannot work, I cannot go out dancing or clubbing or drinking, I am strongly suggested not to have children, my immune system is very weak, my kidneys are also weak,  mostly because during high school I did not care for myself well, and if I could go back in time, I would. Be careful drinking alcohol-when I did I would test my sugar every half hour to make sure its under control. Try to stay away from beer and fruity drinks-they cause your sugar to go up A LOT.<br>  <br>  Again, please don't listen to what a lot of people say-especially the ones so far. Diabetes is a very deadly disease and can cause SO many problems. But taking good care of yourself, again, you can live a very happy life.<br>  <br>  TAKE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR OFTEN-Thanks for reading. I would suggest just doing some research online, just type in google or something. It will be ok-I just can't believe what these people are saying that they never heard of diabetes causing blindness or amputation. Amputation is one of the most major causes of uncared for diabetes. Thanks again, and God Bless. Feel free to email me with questions, or anything. Good luck with yourself!<br>  <br>  I was just reading on and someone doesn't have their info right-TYPE 1 DEFINITELY RUNS IN THE FAMILY, and NOT controlled by pills. Type 1 is COMPLETELY insulin dependent. Type 2 is control with pills and sometimes a small amount of insulin. Type 2 does NOT run in the family, its called adult onsight, and type 1 is the one that runs in the family.<br>  <br>  I still can't believe what these people are telling you, look it up for yourself-don't go by any of this..apparently people have no idea about this disease shouldn't be talking about it.|`|d2a3834786860b34ae904f14b9d846faaa	Most  people  with type I   diabetes do not go blind or lose their feet.|`|7BGyTzjeaa	It depends on what type it is. Either it means that you will have to eat at regular times, or you will have to do that and take insulin injections regularly. If you're careful, it shouldn't be dangerous. Look at the site below. It should be helpful.|`|9984339205f17b90cc180753d98311a9aa	as soon as the doctors work out what type you have they will decide what medication you need.<br>  Type 1 is where you catch a virus, your body fights the virus off but because both viruses and your cells in the pancreas that make insulin are both protein based the body gets confused and attacks it's own cells and they usually don't make more. Type 1 usually doesn't run in the family but type 2 does. Type 2 is where your body becomes resistant to insulin so you need more of it so can be controlled with low sugar diet, tablets and insulin if needed.|`|zt9YOr0iaa	I've never heard of anyone going blind or losing their feet from diabetes.<br>  My nan has it, and two of my friends (age 17)<br>  All of them have to regularly check their blood sugar levels with relatively painless pinpricks.  If the sugar level is too low (when put into the analyser) they eat a pack of crisps or a small bar of chocolate, too high and drink water or take a pill.<br>  If they haven't had enough sugar but they cannot take the test they can feel dizzy and once my nan fainted for a while, but that was a long time ago.<br>  Don't be too worried, it doesn't ruin your life, you just have to pay attention to what you eat and drink.<br>  I don't know what type of diabetes it is which they have, sorry! I'm sure my nan has different to my friends.<br>  hope this helps<br>  xx
udqWAyzAaa	Start with something simple, you are probably just thinking too hard. It doesn't have to be "head over heels" in love. Love is unconditional. There are many different types of love. A mother and child, sisters, brothers, friends, not just the typical boy meets girl stuff. So again love is UNCONDITIONAL. Now get to thinking and write it down!

AG9msdUDaa	A Natural Doctor can, or even a Chiropractor.
MhpccWpmaa	It sounds like you have bacterial vaginosis, and you may have yeast infection too.  The most common symptoms for both infections are as follows:<br>  Bacterial Vaginosis<br>  -Discharge with a really strong fishy odor<br>  -Watery whiteish-grayish discharge<br>  <br>  Yeast Infection<br>  -chunky, cottage cheese like white discharge with no smell<br>  -a lot of itching<br>  <br>  As you can see it seems like you have a combination of symptoms, the white chunkjy discharge of a YI and the horrid fishy smell of BV.  Go to the doctor ASAP and be tested for both.  Until the results come back, do not have intercourse.  Once they come back, obstain from intercourse if you have either or both of the infections until the treatment is complete.  Finish all of the meds, even if the symptoms disappear, finish the meds or else they will not be completely cured.  I know that this is making you feel really self-conscious, but if it's either of these infections they're both extremely common and very easily treatable.  Tell your boyfriend what's going on, don't hide it from him. The doctor may want to treat him for the infection if you have one too just to be safe in case you guys passed it back and forth.  But neither of these are STD's so do not worry.  They just sometimes treat the partner to be 100% safe and try to prevent you from getting it again.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	It's the begininngs of either a yeast infection or bacterial infect. I used to get them all the time (bacterial). My dr told me to stop wearing tight jeans. Go to the doc and he'll test you and give you something to clear it up.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	See a doctor to find out if you have a bacterial infection or a yeast infection, and to get appropriate treatment.  Also--Why are you trying to hide it from your bf?  If you continue to have sex without getting the problem treated, you could infect your bf.  It sounds like you both need to be tested and treated now, if you have continued to have sex with him since noticing these symptoms.  You both need treatment in order to avoid passing the infection back and forth.|`|jlQHB9dvaa	Why would you hide something like this from your boyfriend?  It sounds very much like you have a yeast infection and he can get it from you.

Give your boyfriend some consideration.|`|Kb8SoDAraa	When discharge has a strong odour that usually means theres possibly some kind of infection.....

kbjjbDPXaa	My husband diabetic, he gets these sores, and it is from being diabetic, also my aunt is also , and she has them. You do need to get her to wound specialist, where they will take graph of it, and give her antibiotic cream, or oral one. That is the best I can say. But if she has a lot of boils, like bumps with pus,  what is greta for those is a medication over counter called "boil ease", it does wonders also. That is just about the best, But you need to do the above soon, don't wait.|`|AA11506593	You want to look for a hospital that has a "Wound Care Specialist" on staff. If you live in a small town, try the closest big city. Look on-line or in the yellow pages.
9ZkzBAQCaa	First, see a doctor it you are sick.  If not, take mentholated cough drops.  Kicks any cough for me.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|PwxREEQPaa	Well, I would definitely make a doctor visit. If it's a common viral chest cold, there isn't going to be much a doctor can do for you. If it's bacterial, they can put you on some antibiotics. In the mean time, I would use a good cough suppressant like Sudafed. What also works really good for me and, and I don't ever go without having this in my house is the cough drop Cepacol...the best ever!! Works so much better than halls or ricola. Another thing that works wonders if Mucinex, but if you get that, make sure you get the one that says cough suppressant. Good luck and I hope you feel better.|`|L0o5OJp2aa	I would suggest you see a doctor, you could easily have a chest infection. There are a lot going round.<br>  <br>  If you want to ease symptoms of coughing for example at night you can light an oil burner and burn eucalyptus / olbas oil which will aid your breathing. Or sleep as propped up as you can.<br>  <br>  But the best advice I can give is to either speak to or to go and see a doctor or even try a pharmacist first as they often will be able to offer you some free advice. :-)<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon.
kBp9IzQqaa	Yes because it damages the part of your brain that controls impulse.  If you wait until that part has developed, you wouldn't want to try weed.  If you smoke weed while it is developing, you can never rid yourself of the addiction.|`|8j70Neqeaa	yes its bad,it can lead to worse drugs and drinking.and a life of hell, jail, and the list gos on.take iy from me. i been there|`|cC7TScJRaa	It's bad to smoke weed in general.  Doesn't matter the age; you'll most likely suffer repercussions in the end.|`|wDtA9hrhaa	no, Just don't smoke it when your doing something important, like school. But if you wanna just chill its better than cigarettes.|`|n5TYFgETaa	remember, one joint is worth 4 cigarettes,  i'm not a big fan of drugs, but it's always up to the user.|`|ZpG05jupaa	It's bad to smoke weed at any age...|`|tv5oAhs4aa	weed is not good for you if thts what its asking. but it doesnt do much. unless you smoke ALOT. but compared to cigarettes it like eating cookies but still its illegal and has greater consequences so be careful. <br>  <br>  im not going to sit here and tell you not to because its your life but just DONT! do anything other than weed if you decide to do it b.c its considered a Gateway Drug usuallly leading to trying other drugs such as coke XTC(extacy), etc etc<br>  <br>  PLZ READ MY ? <br>  title: PLZ HELP ME!~!~! Pass Drug Test|`|U3PfjymDaa	No. These people act like they know everything about it when they don't. Stick to it only on the weekends, Don't do it before school, and do it with people you trust. You'll be fine. I am speaking with a 4.00 GPA and 35 ACT score, so this doesn't completely screw up your life like they are trying to tell you, just be careful. Also, there is nothing in weed that causes it to be chemically addictive.|`|is13swG4aa	nah I did it and it has done nothing to me. Actually I still work at the same job I had as a teen. 7-11 has great benefits.|`|wdzL4cZZaa	Uh, duh. yes
igI5yX0vaa	A common way to get them is when you have to take antibiotics for something.<br>  <br>  At any given time, there is a balance between yeast and bacteria in that part of your body.  When you kill the bacteria, the yeast grow unchecked and cause infection.<br>  <br>  Do not try home treatments for this type of infection.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	Hahahahaha... I'm sorry, you have a legitimate question. It's just that you are asking about yeast infections and you name is muffin grl.|`|wFN8bVqsaa	It's really common for every woman to get them at least once, and some get them pretty often. Yes, they have creams and pill-like inserts that you can get at the store and can be cured in 1 to 7 days. They can be caused by a bunch of things, stress, wearing a wet bathing suit for a while, a reaction to lube down there, improper wiping/hygeniene, panties that don't allow air or are not breathable, etc. Mostly they are really itchy down there, can cause redness, there is whitish discharge and urine gets clouded (not clear). They are really common, and cured easily (although really frustrating at the time).|`|5MFBoWSAaa	Yeast infection is when you have too much yeast in your vagina, and upsets the balance and therefore causes an infection. You can get over-the-counter medications for it, and if those don't work you have to go to the doctor.|`|HZKsNwbeaa	Its yeast that grows in a womans private causing infection|`|7d96b4f24578cd2c4b4f5474341984afaa	A little too much cheese on the taco?<br>  <br>  lol...no um here you go.... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast_infection" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast_infec...</a>|`|krThCHxyaa	<a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/faq/vaginal-yeast-infections.cfm#a" rel="nofollow">http://www.womenshealth.gov/faq/vaginal-...</a><br>  <br>  this will answer all your questions and more, it helped me when i didn't  know what it was|`|C3HZRdYfaa	itchy (very itchy) problem in the ..... nether regions of a female body    you get them by not wiping in the right direction and not wiping well enough. you can get medication at any drug store it takes 1 to 7 days to treat|`|cm8G7AiCaa	no u need to go to a doctore to get it treated|`|Yw2Ynm0Daa	dont worry about it|`|x7FjDcjzaa	you get them if you eat expired bread
AcY9JgJsaa	You could try applying vitamin e oil to them, just get the pill capsule and break it open to get the oil out and apply it to your face.  Don't pick them because they will linger longer and take forever to heal as you disrupt the skins repairing process.  I don't think they will be completely gone by Thursday so you may need to cover them up if you want.  There is also scar creams like Scar Zone, BioOil, Mederma.  But they don't work overnight.  I say if your talent outshines your scabs then they wouldn't even notice.  People rarely notice your imperfections but we feel they do because were self conscious, and if someone points them out its because they are ignorantly rude.  But yeah there is really no overnight help for them, just let them heal and you could apply said scar medication. Hope this helps and hope you get the part! :~)|`|AA11041425	Don't pick them because they may scar.  You may need to use coverup on them.  In the long run, you're better to let the scabs heal and fall off on their own, rather than having scars or pits that can last a lifetime.  Besides, you'll be using stage makeup if you get a role in the play, and no one will be able to see your spots from an audience.|`|G5yQtHs9aa	Ok, the auditions, if you truly have talent, no one is going to care about some acne scars.|`|x7FjDcjzaa	what is so funny about you being a girl?|`|fOzV0oHvaa	Put a dab of Vasoline on them at night before bed.|`|Xeg4XBxiaa	Just let them be, they will go away.

1d23b09d86f4ff3f146a2f80099f97e9aa	While you can find various websites run by doctors that accept questions...most of the time it's general knowledge stuff. They generally won't get into any specific conditions, or if they do, they make sure to tell you to go see your actual doctor.<br>  <br>  Some health-insurance providers have systems set up for things like this, you can either email or call a number and communicate with someone that will give you some idea on a more offical level.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't however be afraid to go to your GP, you shouldn't be afraid of them laughing at you...well, they might, but it'll be good-hearted. My doctor laughed when I went to see him for getting racked in the nuts, but it was after the serious business. If they can't do anything, they can generally reccommend a specialist that will.
gPvOcB6oaa	I searched in vain, I have no heart shaped vein on my throat..sorry|`|pM4OJ4iwaa	nope :/
JBugDqvraa	NO that's absolutely the right thing to do, REST. <br>  Your body is going through enough trying to fight the infection and you're only putting it through more stress by exercising. <br>  Resting will lead to far quicker recovery, and yes you're sooo right about spreading infection if your out and about so id be under the covers too.
wbZp6ZcPaa	Keep in mind that this is your doctors job. He chose to be in a profession to help people and should know that not all symptoms present with physical findings. It is his job to help you through this and possibly recommend a therapist-which it sounds like you could use- to help you. Just tell your doctor that you're still having a great deal of anxiety and it's leading to depression. A good doctor will listen and do their best to help you. If he doesn't suggest it I would say you should also ask for a referral to therapy. Maybe talking it out with someone will help. Good luck!|`|uKmNYqGgaa	Hi,  From what you've written here, I think you should print this (your question) and take it with you to the doctor, and let them read it.  That will help you with the stress of telling them in person.<br>   <br>  I would suggest you ask your doctor for a referral to get some counseling.  You've had enough issues in the last few years that it is overwhelming you - and likely causing your anxiety problem.  Getting counseling will help you deal with them, and you'll feel like a whole new person.<br>   <br>  I wish you the best of luck Wednesday at the doctor, let us know how it goes.|`|1e89b07b4ec142128ab2f9d84821ffb2aa	Be honest with your doctor. Thats why there's the HIPPA Act, it's about patient-doctor confidentiality. He too can prescribe other medications to help you with your anxiety, also your dose may not be strong enough for you. Furthermore consider seeing a counselor who specializes in treating patients with your history.|`|Fl42pZW0aa	It sounds like the issue isn't a physical problem and that you've been bringing up your issues to your general practitioner only and not a mental health care provider.  If this is the case, then you definitely need to speak with someone who's trained in mental health care.  Your GP is great when it comes to physical problems, but not so great when it comes to mental health.  If your GP isn't giving you the attention you feel you need, ask him/her for a referal to a psychologist or find one on your own online.  They will definitely be able to help you out!
9EVcTnUWaa	NO!!! GP's aren't taught any more about mental health than any other doctor and if they are honest and a good doctor they would refer you to someone who truly deals with it. Would you go to your GP when you were pregnant even though technically you could??? No because they don't know all of the latest procedures and medications for these things.  That's one reason that, they should refer you to a practicing psychiatrist or psychologist. They may give out prescriptions for medications but if they are really good than they know to give referrals so that you can really deal with what ever the issues are.  You can't do that with a GP.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	Around half of what GPs deal with these days is related to mental health - mainly anxiety and depression, and the majority of them are good in dealing with it. The main things which can be offered are counselling or some kind of talk therapy, however there is often a long waiting list for these, or medication which some people don't want to take. Some GPs are happier prescribing medications than others, and particularly with younger patients talk therapy is likely to be of more benefit.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	A GP is training in a little of everything, but he would not be good to do any diagnosing on a mental illness. He may get some good ideas, but if it is just anxiety, then you should be fine with a GP only.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	You should ask your GP if he thinks you should consult a psychiatrist for the anxiety - a psychiatrist is much better educated on mental health issues than a regular doctor.  If there is something that is causing the anxiety to happen, your regular doctor likely wouldn't be able to help you with it - whereas a psychiatrist could.<br>   <br>  A lot depends on what is causing your anxiety, and how serious (bad) it is.
AE3lv4pRaa	You can lose ten pounds with in two weeks,if you follow these:-<br>  <br>  1. You can spend 2 weeks in intensive aerobic and strength exercise. This will require you to spend more than an hour each day working out. I don't mean taking a stroll. I mean intensive cardio routines such as running, rowing, cycling, swimming, or hiking. The more intense the better. Be aware that if you're not physically fit you may injure yourself by suddenly taking on a large dose of exercise. Choose a reliable fitness plan which will instruct you on how to not go over board.<br>  <br>  2. You can use a detox based diet which will cleanse your body and get it to drop a lot of weight fast. But be aware that this will be mostly liquid weight, so that it may not last for a long time.<br>  <br>  3. You can use a weight loss plan which is based on Calorie Shifting. This is a weight loss method in which you manipulate your metabolism to remain running high and burning fat at a rapid pace. This is done by constantly changing what you eat so that your metabolism is fooled to believe that you're not even dieting. The primary Calorie Shifting diet, Fat Loss 4 Idiots, can get you to lose 9 pounds in 11 days.<br>  <br>  You should remember that losing 10 pounds in 2 weeks requires a firm commitment on your part. You should also know that you'll need to work hard to keep the weight off in the future. Choose a diet plan which is reasonable, doesn't starve you, and is easy to stick to for a long time.|`|nZGdxyWVaa	you don't really need to lose weight because you are at the right weight range. but if you really want to lose weight keep up what you are doing and remember muscle weighs more than fat.

More women need to lift weights!|`|cxNLOPHNaa	I always do weight bearing exercises. I'm over 40. Weight bearing exercise is crucial for women over 40. I use free weights (2, 3, and 5 pounds). But also, on my days off, I put on 2 pound ankle and 1 pound wrist weights in the morning, and wear them all day, as I do my errands/housework.<br>  <br>  Since using my weights, I did gain 6 pounds. But that was actually a good thing. I wanted to get thinner. And like everybody, thought losing weight was the answer. But weight bearing exercise was the real answer. I gained weight, but lost inches, since I actually lost fat and gained muscle mass.|`|lYr1zmQeaa	i just havent because i dont want to pay the gym membership or buy my own but i dont think women who do lift weighs are "unfeminine"(if that's even a word)|`|xqQO81Omaa	Never, most of my workouts consist of weight lifting or strength training.

The lowest "normal" weight you can have at your height would be 111 pounds. That said, I personally believe it depends on how you get that thin. My cousin is 5' 5 and eats all the time and weighs 105 pounds. She would be considered too thin, but she's healthy. If you plan on eating a sufficient amount and exercising, and not starving yourself, then I think it's fine. <br>  <br>  I'm 5' 7 and I'm aiming for 105 pounds and everyone thinks it's too thin, but I'm not doing it for them so I don't really care what they say. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|mlaLgoaSaa	yes. you are too thin. you should be around 120 lbs (on the low side). <br>  <br>  but, i say this assuming you are done growing. if you are younger, you may still be growing and developing. if you are seriously concerned with your weight, talk to your parents about setting up a doctors appointment. or, if your parents dont seem to care, talk to a phys. ed. teacher at your school.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|JooZnoZdaa	i LOOKED UP A GOOD WEiGHT RANGE FOR SOMEONE YOUR HEiGHT & THE MiNiMUM WAS 113 POUNDS.

n4uffXEtaa	She needs more calories since she is growing and going through puberty!!! Tell her she needs energy, and she could be more healthy when she consumes more calories. She's only 11, and she is worried about THAT. she needs more calories. She can still eat healthy w/ extra calories. She should drink milk to, and lot's of fiber|`|UZKg2odzaa	actually this is pretty much perfect, maybe not enough food. <br>  i don't understand your question, i guess.|`|niZBsn9Qaa	The child is.........a child. What she ate is...not enough for her growing body. She needs to eat about 2000 calories a day MINIMUM to maintain her perfect little weight.<br>  <br>  Now, dont get onto her too much for worrying about her weight. Its NEVER too early to get into good eating habits and I applaud her for thinking about her health and wanting to grow into a healthy happy adult. BUT please tell her that she is still growing and she doesnt want to deny her body nutrients it needs to grow. It could stunt her growth, cause health problems, etc. So if she is active and eats around 2000 calories a day of lean proteins, non-fat dairy products, LOTS of fruits and veggies (they are essential for her growth) and lean proteins, she'll be just fine. :)

Or you can look for probiotic capsules at your local drugstore and take those, such as acidophiles.|`|fRUUNkqZaa	Long-term antibiotic use will kill off a lot of the good bacteria in your gut.  I always recommend that anyone on antibiotics take probiotics (acidophilus et al) to reduce the risk of this happening.  <br>  You may want to consider a trial off dairy: there's some research showing a connection between dairy products and acne.<br>  There's also research showing a connection between high glycemic foods (sugary foods, pop, white bread, etc) and acne.

ZIOLl00xaa	okay..... more then likely guy number 1 did. there is no doubt in my mind that he gave it to you! Being that you had type 1 already you can further infect your self and spread it else where. Your first guy is a jerk for not wanting to be tested. its his own damn health. If u had any kind of sex with doug, protected or not...u could have still passed it on to him.... You stated early in your writing about guy 1, that he had herpes so whether he will get retested or not you should know that he gave it to you. But dont worry about that guy. Get doug to a free clinic which is located almost anywhere (no insurance) needed....and they give prescrptions for the drugs needed if he is tested positive. And educate you both on your std because you seem confused and misguided.....good luck!
YupMCYHlaa	It doesn't sound like melanoma to me.  Like the other guy said, if it's been elevated a long time, it's probably okay.  Keep an eye on it, and if it grows or changes, that's a bad sign.<br>  <br>  I have moles on my skin (they're called 'nevi').  When I got a checkup my doctor mentioned them and referred me to a dermatologist.  She said that we are currently having an epidemic of skin cancer, mostly melanoma, and they want to take special care of 'moley men', as she  put it.  She referred me to another place where they take photos of your whole body, to use as a baseline.  I'm supposed to look at all my moles at least once ever 90 days and report any changes (but I don't).  She said 50 years ago any average person had a 1 in 100 chance of having a  melanoma somewhere on their body, but these days its more, and people with moles even more.<br>  <br>  Next time you see a doctor, point it out.  I've heard that usually if they suspect anything they don't bother with a biopsy, they just take it off and -then- look at it for cancer.|`|9w9Q83tFaa	If it starts itching,goes red then see a doctor. keep it out of the sun and don't worry.|`|2zHxgg5eaa	If you have had it for a looong time and it hasn't grown, its probably not melanoma. Elevation just means it's not only pigment thats different. It is probably just a mole.
F32uPjAraa	Dairy is bad. Humans are the only creature on this planet, that ingest milk products after they are weaned. Whey is puss from a foreign species. If you want to keep losing weight do what I did. Keep up the cardio exercise, this is very good. Eat good healthy meals containing plenty of meat, fresh vegetables,and mushrooms contain plenty of protien. For snacks eat fresh fruit and nuts. Avoid like the plague any food that contains any sugars, they are poison. Not only do they dissolve your teeth and bones, but they make you fat. This is any sugars glucose, fructose, sucrose, palm sugar, corn syrup. Also stop eating any food with flour. This means any bread, pastries, pasta, and gravy. Eat grilled fish or even canned tuna at least three time a week. Good luck mate, If I can do it I know you can too.|`|972OdSIJaa	yes but can cause diarhrea|`|8TmK8Qklaa	yep whey protein is great, I use it daily in a shake.

Bulking up requires a different way to workout with minimum cardio.|`|4NiRJZkAaa	Yes if you are a baby !|`|l3Wq57gsaa	it is 100 percent safe b/c protein is in every meat/dairy product. and it will help you get stronger but remember that every gram of protein has 4 calories (its not alot but it is just good to remember).|`|d611c06e80f18dfa904ca6778e57a483aa	It's safe, but according to Weight Training For Dummies, you don't necessarily need it, read on....<br>       Serious athletes do need slightly more protein than the average person. ( They need more Carbohydrates and fat too, too.) However, most americans eat twice the amount or protein they need anyway, so the chances of a weight lifter not getting enough protein are slim. In fact, If you eat too many calories, your body stores these calories as fat, even if many of the calories came from"Ripped Fuel Thermogenic Protein Drink. Eating too much protein can cause kidney problems.|`|U9cLxjUjaa	Get it from a good quality manufacturer and you should be ok.  Its not a miracle though, you still have to work out hard to see differences.  Just do not over do it ... you can end up having calcium deficiency if you take too much protein.

Much cleaner and less processed. Its natural to the body unlike the protein found in red meat. Fish (specifically salmon) and Whey are 2 of the best sources for protein.<br>  <br>  To the person who gave me the second thumbs down (which was obviously because of what I said about meat since those who agree with me on whey here didnt mention meat and dont have the additional thumbs down lol), Japan has the highest life expectancy out of any large countries and China has one of the lowest along with USA. Yet China has a similar environment to Japan. This is because China and USA are huge red meat eating countries, while Japan eats mostly fish. USA has better medical facilities, yet Japanese live much longer than us because of their diet. If red meat was meant to be consumed, then doctors wouldnt tell people with heart problems to stay away from it, since it eventually clogs arteries etc. The protein found in meat is not a natural protein to the human body, whey and fish are. They have already proved that chicken and fish are cleaner sources than red meat.|`|oZpqEdI7aa	Description:<br>  <br>  Whey Protein can only be sourced from milk. It is the extraction of Milk's protein, leaving behind the large fat content and the lactose. We can discuss those two ingredients at a later date.<br>  <br>  Protein is one of the 3 main nutrient groups, the others are Fat and Carbohydrates (not including Fibre). Protein is made up of 28 Amino Acids, 20 of which are required by the body so that it can exist. Therefore, Protein is the most important Nutrient and should be consumed every day.<br>  <br>  Below are the uses of Whey Protein and not Protein in general. I'll go over the other sources of protein in later posts.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Uses:<br>  <br>  As with Vitamin B complex, Whey Protein has so many uses I'll put it in point form. This time though I will have to go into more detail for each use:<br>  <br>  <br>  A - Recovery:<br>  A good Whey Protein Supplement will contain all three Branch Chain Amino Acids. These Amino Acids are also Essential Amino Acids which must be obtained through the diet. Before I name these Amino Acids, let me say to all those who may have heard of certain Amino Acids aiding recovery, these three are the MAIN ones for recovery.<br>  <br>  The three Branch Chain Amino Acids are Leucine, Isoleucine and Valine. These help Muscle Growth, Repair and Preserve Energy. All the main ingredients for recovery.<br>  <br>  B - Muscle Growth:<br>  The average person needs 35g of protein split up between before and after a workout to feed their muscles. When you train, your muscles pull apart and create little gaps, these gaps will close up very fast and will produce nothing if they aren't provided Protein. Protein Supplements will fill in those gaps and cement for instant growth. All gains are microscopical so don't expect to be huge overnight.<br>  <br>  C - L-Arginine:<br>  A good Protein Supplement will also contain L-Arginine, this Amino Acid is a natural Growth Hormone releaser. If combined with L-Ornithine it will quadruple the gains. But come to me before you try this combination.<br>  <br>  D - Provides Energy:<br>  As I just said above, the Branch Chain Amino Acids preserve energy. This is also the case for many of the other Amino Acids. Some of which are not in any Whey Protein supplements. This is not one of my main points so I won't go into detail unless asked.<br>  <br>  E - Acts As Anti-Stress/Anxiety Supplement:<br>  Once again not a main point, but important to note. Training produces Serotonin which is the hormone that makes you happy. Not only does a Protein supplement motivate you to train more it also contains L-Phenylalaline (try that one out loud!) which is a natural Mood Enhancer. Caution: Not to be mistaken with DL-Phenylalaine which is a pain reliever and can have side effects.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are so many more I'm going to have to come back to Protein. If this post gets too long it'll be too hard to read/take everything in.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How To Take:<br>  <br>  This will be the same as any other time I've said this on this Forum.<br>  <br>  <br>  1 Scoop in the morning before breakfast (every day).<br>  <br>  <br>  1 Scoop two hours before bed (days not training). <br>  <br>  That's twice on days you are not training.<br>  <br>  1 scoop an hour before training.<br>  <br>  1 or 2 scoops 5 - 15 mins after training. (this is the most important, if taken after those 15 mins then it won't have the special effect) The special effect s that your muscles will instantly soak up anything you take which will give 5 times greater results.<br>  <br>  <br>  Take Whey Protein with water and your weight lose well significantly go up<br>  <br>  And by the way it is very safe(there are no reported side effects-just dont overdue it->too much of anything including whey protein will hurt your liver abilities)<br>  <br>  AND STOP DOING CARDIO BEFORE YOU DO WEIGHTS!!<br>  Doing cardio before a workout has a negative effect on your body, switch it up to weights then cardio, and your results will be much better|`|wwRbkCMraa	yes whey protein is safe.  Whey protein is already in many of the things you probably eating daily. did u know it's in Cheeze it crackers.. candy bars, pop tarts and many other foods, including almost all dairy products like yogurt, milk, cheese etc. Whey is a naturally occurring protein in dairy and it has a lot of health benefits even if you don't workout.<br>  <br>  Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple.

6NZeItMAaa	chamomilla tea  and spirulin algae are very good to fight food anxiety.<br>  <br>  A balanced diet will permit to eat and lose weight.<br>  <br>  One reason why most diets fail is because we are used to have some foods that fulfill our needs for sweet. First of these foods is often chocolate. Chocolate fights depression and give us a peaceful sensation almost immediately. It’s rich in minerals and vitamins but very caloric. The chocolate diet includes some controlled absorptions during the day that will help you to have that delicious feeling and lose weight at the same time.<br>  <br>  There is no question here of taking chocolate, pasta and pop corns every day but of healthy balanced menus for two weeks containing an unstopping variety of foods: dairy products, fruits and vegetables, starchy foods, meat and fish, etc.<br>  <br>  The principle is to play on the light but by agreeing chocolate and a small pleasure sometimes to hold over the duration and not to feel frustrations. It promises between 2 and 6 pounds a week according to the weight to lose. <br>  <br>  The chocolate diet can be followed by everybody because it has been studied by a nutritionist to bring to our bodies all the nutrients that we need.|`|BJugETlOaa	You need to eat foods with fiber in them, they make you fuller|`|mlaLgoaSaa	as long as you are alive, you will get hungry. its a part of living. your body needs calories and nutrients to keep your metabolism going. you can curb your appetite though. try to get most of your calories from complex carbohydrates. eat whole grains and lots of fruits and vegetables. this will keep you feeling fuller, for longer. also, dont forget to drink AT LEAST 8 oz of water every day. <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|Y9WZR4h2aa	drink water..w8 10 mins..of your still hungry u need to eat something light if its gone that means its thirst<br>  <br>  many poeple confuse thirst for hunger|`|aIwRYOh5aa	eat more food|`|GiYVrmI3aa	Drink lots of fluids to fill up your stomach.|`|f4f9beec4ec2b2cb70c68629daf530b1aa	drink more water

I work with kids with CF and one of the first things you learn is that every presentation is different, and not all kids with CF have the common gene mutation that causes it meaning it is harder to diagnose. We have kids who have what docs call 'atypical CF', meaning they have all the symptoms but pass sweat tests and don't have the most common gene mutation. Obviously, they still do genetic testing on these kids but they are treated like they have CF and this seems to work for them.<br>  <br>  Also, has it been considered by his doctors that he may have two conditions-- one pancreatic and one respiratory-- which are not connected?

aIZfiU6Kaa	'Asseen from outside', my doctor told me about this and as an ex medical rep I was extremely sceptical, but what do you know?, there's an enzyme in a banana skin which DOES cure verrucas.<br>  <br>  You scrape the soft white part from the inside of the banana skin, place a piece about the size of a postage stamp on top of the verruca and hold it in place with a strip of elastoplast, if you do this every night for a week, you will see the dead skin just fall away.|`|GM3zog4Jaa	You have to tape a small piece of very ripe, even blackened banana skin with the inside surface in contact with the verrucas. The explanation lies in the fact there is an enzyme in the banana skin that attacks the verruca.<br>  I'd think the time it takes depends on the size of the verruca. So just keep applying until it's gone.|`|mWQfdEHvaa	I'm not sure about banana skin because I've not heard about that before. However, if you try using undiluted lemon essential oil every day you should see it disappear. Make sure you do use it every day though! Good luck. If this doesn't work, go to your GP and they will freeze it off.|`|KJMEomouaa	Mmm heard that it is supposed to work, apparently a slice of garlic is supposed to work too... my advice after suffering verrucas for years is to see a chiropodist or freeze it off x|`|HltUWMgOaa	Go see a medical doctor, not a witch doctor.<br>  <br>  verrucas are contagious|`|eic9fd2Qaa	what a verucca, i really do not now

TDLmhGauaa	It is hard I know it is but you cannot crumble after coming so far and progressing so well. I have suffered from severe depression (not bipolar - thank God!) but I used to mutilate my arms, force myself to vomit and even attempted suicide. It does not have to be just about medication and the right combination of anti - depressants. Sometimes it helps to talk to somebody especially when you are feeling the most vulnerable.<br>  It is during these tough times that the support really helps, alot of medical practitioners don't understand this and often leave us to deal with this all on our own. Maybe, if you haven't already, you should consider keeping a diary or a journal that you can keep record on and confide in when you are at your most vulnerable.<br>  <br>  After a very bad argument or a series of traumatic events sometimes, I admit to wanting to reach for the razor blade again, but thus far I have managed not to - I hope that you can do the same. Keep up the amazing work and Good Luck!!!|`|kho481csaa	I just stopped.<br>  No meds.<br>  No helpful friend.<br>  No life saviour.<br>  Just stopped.<br>  <br>  I wanted to do it for God.<br>  But when I became distanced with God, I couldn't do it again, because I had no where to hide the cuts.<br>  I struggle with it every single day.<br>  But I don't do it.<br>  Maybe it'll get easier?<br>  <br>  Just don't give in.|`|ab567fzlaa	I cannot give you my own story, but I can give you a friend's story who I helped overcome it. My friend was prone to self harm because she had lived a terrible life. Normally I would say not to ask for details, but I think you should know just how bad of a situation she was in. Her mother was broke and had to became a prostitute just to live, and she was in an entirely different town. Her father had either died or left, we didn't generally talk about such sad things, so I never learned which of the 2. I'm not sure even she knew. Anyway, she lived with her grandparents, and sometimes her brother, and her brother was generally getting hurt. She was terrified all the time, because she lived in a portion of town where drive-by shootings were an almost everyday occurrence.<br>  One day, in our math class, I just didn't do any of my homework while I was there, and gave an hour of my time to talk to her. This was possibly the most important thing I have ever done, because I introduced her to God. She became Christian very soon after that, and a devout one at that. She went to Church every Sunday, didn't say the Lord's name in vain, everything. She did this for Jesus. She managed to stop.|`|tDVO49aTaa	I got the hell out of my house and started having a life. I gave myself no time to dwell on all the problems that cause me to hurt myself. Sure, I had half a year of night terrors and I still get them from time to time, but I wouldn't allow myself to fall back on abusing myself. I quit cold turkey and completely changed the way I run my life- there was no place for the depressed, harmful person I once was (and still am and always will be, at least a bit). Hated therapy, didn't want the drugs I was prescribed, to me those things were crutches- just a cover-up for the problems.|`|LGkb4xibaa	i grew to feel more in control and less depressed as i became more comfortable with myself.

Y4s4Om38aa	They both have their ups and downs.  Bipolar man would have more understanding of what was going on......if both are relitivly stable and on top of working to stay stable, they could work together.  Downside, just the extremes that come with it can feed off each other and completely clash and be a disaster for both if not managed so well.|`|AyeYeS2baa	Hard to really say, but two bipolars could be really difficult<br>  A normal guy may have a hard time empathizing the bipolars emotions and get the hell out of dodge at the first sign of trouble.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	I'm trying to work this out, and haven't come to any conclusions yet! I have severe anxiety and depression and I have been in relationships with people with AND without mental health problems. I personally prefer people who have had/got mental health issues because they have a level of compassion and understanding that you can't really get if you haven't suffered in that way. But obviously their behaviour can be difficult to deal with, which can cause more stress and anxiety!<br>  On the other hand, someone who hasn't had mental health problems themselves won't ever be able to fully understand what it's like. They could lose patience. But they might be a more calming and steady influence.|`|vqtpF1Q5aa	I have Bipolar Disorder - I am 41 -  and it wasn't brought to light until I had been married for 13 years. I can say that through all the years we have been married - now 20 1/2 - and we have 2 children - a daughter 17 and a son 9. <br>  <br>  I have known women who have met men with BP and have had very enjoyable relationships as long as they know about the BP are willing to help watch for signs of things that do happen with us who have BP....There are things as in depression, mood swings, stopping of taking medications. Those things are key and you will be able to know.<br>  <br>  Just because someone has BP doesn't mean they can't live a relatively  'normal' life. I take a mood stabilizer (Lamictal) and a antidepressant (Pristiq) and I also have Klonopin if needed for anxiety which is very rare.................This might should like a awful lot to someone who doesn't have a mental issue BUT I can honestly say to walk by me in a store....to go to one of my son's baseball games....to be at a high school event....a parent teacher conference or even go to a dinner function because my husband is a Police Officer............<br>  ***YOU would NEVER KNOW I have BP**<br>  <br>  So the answer to your question is:<br>  Male to female, female to male, female to female, male to male......<br>  You *CAN* have a good relationship with someone who has a mental issue such as Bipolar Disorder --- Depression -- Anxiety -- <br>  as long as they do what their doctor  says and take medications - which in all honesty they should have.....things will be ok. <br>  <br>  If for instance you see changes in mood - sadness or over happiness then you need to say something to that person because it will help them. <br>  <br>  I hope that if you or someone you know is thinking about entering into a relationship you go into it with open eyes as you would any other medication --- we aren't anyone to be afraid of -- IF they keep their self where they should be with medications --- ** a mood stabilizer ** -- is key in having Bipolar and there are many out there that people will be prescribed. They will have to go and see their Psychiatrist about every 3 months for a 'check in' to see how things are going....this is typical and things should go well...<br>  <br>  -- I truly hope this helps  =)|`|xUcjzYPdaa	I'd say it'd be better to be involved with someone who was psychiatrically healthily.

S7Q3fRvoaa	Ok,<br>  First off, i am glad to hear you are seeing a nutritionist for help and im also glad to hear you are willing to listen to what she has to say.  The number of calories you have been eating is no where near enough for anyone, let alone a teenager your age.  2000 is a more reasonable amount.  You will absolutely in no way get fat or gain weight from eating 2000 calories.  You will maintain.  1500 is still a little too low, you might end up losing.  Aim for 2000, that's a good number.  If you eat healthy and do exercise (in moderation, dont overdo it) you will look great for bikini season.<br>  <br>  And sweetie, you are only 13 years old, have fun and enjoy your life, dont waste your time worrying about calories, ok?<br>  <br>  Take care|`|hR87A418aa	wow ur to skinny for me.. here a lil tip men these days like girls with big booties and boobs. i already know when you turn over the age of 16+ ur gonna have a pancake butt and boobiess =-[[[[.... well cya|`|9ARNK0Bzaa	If you eat 1500 calories u will probably lose weight. Just make sure you eat approximately 2000 calories a day and keep doing your exercise and you will tone up in no time =) <br>  <br>  good luck -x-|`|vqdyPK0iaa	it should be fine if your exercising just exercise a little bit extra. i know what your going through. don't worry about gaining weight. take it one step at a time.|`|QevBVANtaa	WHO CARES... You are 13 and anorexic!!|`|JoyAPIGeaa	after a diet has ended you're meant to adjust back to a normal amount of calories to maintain weight, not stay on the reduced number. also staying on too few calories prevents you getting all the nutrients you need and you would often hit a plateau where you no longer lose any weight.  eating a normal balanced diet at around 2000 calories won't make you gain weight. your body will burn around 1200 calories just staying in bed all day so you'd need extra just to walk around and such -- normal energy use (2000 calories is usual altogether)  if you're exercising for an hour a day on top, you'll be fit and healthy :)  the weight training will tone you up nicely.

An MRI is usually only good to look for a specific diagnosis, one that would fit your symptoms.  If you have no symptoms, then you probably don't need one.  Also, the radiologist who is reading it won't have a specific thing to look for - so the odds of an accurate reading are less.|`|8uS2YZN8aa	Any time you do an invasion into your body with any  radio signals or magnetic imaging, you leave your body open to other problems.<br>  There is a class action suit going on now for some very debilitating disease from MRI,s.<br>  My nephew has a very bad rash and swollen joints the lawyers think was caused by an MRI he got, about two weeks after his MRI he started to break out all over his body and has been very sick for two years now.<br>  <br>  I've had a few and I was not afflicted with any problems, but some people have serious problems with these electronic machines.<br>  <br>  So if you want an MRI just for information purposes, I would not get one unless you have a problem and need to find out if you have a tumor or some other problem, then I wouldn't hesitate.<br>  You can google for information about MRI diseases and get an answer about the results of MRI problems.

wgE9AhIsaa	Personally, I don't think it's at all safe to do drugs when you are cheerleading. If you are a flyer your balance might be affected or you might become paranoid and that will affect your ability to perform a successful mount. If you are a base think of how dangerous it would be to be on drugs when someone else is depending on you to support them, anticipate their moves, and cradle them. Your sharpness and memory will most likely be affected and you may hurt yourself if you are tumbling. Your squad members are depending on you to perform to the best of your abilities, and hopefully you want to kick *** at your last home game. Please don't do this before the game. I agree with whoever else said to do it after the game. Drugs should be used for celebrating and relaxing and when you have no responsibilities except to have a good time.|`|utpVwJ0Xaa	just do it! theyre yummmmmy. i ate 2 and i was perfect. if you eat less than half you get the full experience! dont be a chicken s h i t.|`|WPzaF2osaa	Special brownies contain hemp oil which contain canabinoids, with no pharmacologic effects.

LYeMqJIRaa	I had mine done in June because my wife was beginning to have problems with the pill and I didn't want her harming her health.  Besides I couldn't ask her to have her tubes tied as it was far more invasive than a little snip right ?  Well that little snip has made the last 10 months of my life hell. Eight days after the procedure I discovered that I had lost all sensation at the point of ejaculation. Only 1 time in almost 10 months would I rate it at a 4 or 5 out of 10 the rest pretty much zero.  I did however discover pain first it was prostate problems (was not told how common they were in vasectomized guys until after wards) then after that went away I developed a spermatocele (sperm has nowhere to go so epididymis swells like a balloon causing pain. I am currently battling a new round of pain (got pretty bad about 2 hours ago) from the scrotal surgery I just had in an effort to stop the "old" pain.  I have to wait this one out to see if it worked.  Many guys have no problems and I am genuinely happy for them. For me it was the biggest mistake of my life. My sex life died at age 38.

A lot of nonsensical responses here.  I had a vasectomy in 2005 and was forced to have it reversed in 2006 due to pain, congestion, granulomas, vas leakage, and an immune system response.<br>  <br>  A skilled microsurgeon like those at the Cleveland Clinic can restore patency with 90-95% certainty.  I've got a 17-month old daughter as living, breathing proof.<br>  <br>  Anyone that tells you that post-vasectomy complications are a myth is lying.  A fair and honest assessment of vasectomy would conclude that post-vasectomy complications, includuing chronic pain, are rare, but very, very real.  If you're inquisitive, search the web for studies by Ball and Chen; Nangia, Myles, and Thomas; Tandon and Sabanegh; and, Christiansen and Sandlow.  That's just a sample of real, documented instances and studies about the causes and treatment of post-vasectomy pain syndrome.<br>  <br>  You are to be applauded for your concern about birth control pills.  There is plenty of evidence that extended use of "the pill" contributes to breast cancer.  However, that doesn't make vasectomy the next best choice.<br>  <br>  Do your own research on vasectomy, identify the risk factors and determine if you have any of them (high sperm count, prior manipulation of the spermatic cord, hyperactive immune system, et al) and read the research that indicates chronic pain from vasectomy can be as low as 1/1000 or as high as 1/7.  Then draw your own conclusion.|`|AA11212578	If you truly don't want kids anymore,  go ahead and get it done.   Not that big of a deal.

You'll be good to go back to work by Monday and back in action by mid week.<br>  <br>  Things to note:<br>  <br>  1) Doc will tell you that you need to "clean your self out"  (to the tune of about 36 times or so) and bring samples for testing so DON'T assume your sterile the day after the operation. <br>  <br>  2) Consider the operation irreversible.    Reversing a vasectomy only has about a 2-5% success rate (according to my Doc).<br>  <br>  Vasectomy is the best alternative to contraception.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 2004 and January 2006 nine surgeons carried out vasectomies in 625 men (mean age 39.9 years, sd 5.6) under local anaesthesia. A questionnaire was devised to establish the presence of any scrotal or testicular pain, and to characterize this discomfort; 6 months after the procedure a modified version of the same questionnaire was administered. RESULTS: In all, 593 (94.7%) men returned the preoperative questionnaires and were entered into the study; 488 (82.2%) of these completed the follow-up questionnaire, giving a mean (sd) follow-up of 6.8 (1.6) months. In all, 65 men reported new-onset scrotal pain at 7 months (14.7%). The mean visual analogue score for this pain was 3.4/10. Four men (0.9%) in the responding group described pain after vasectomy as 'quite severe and noticeably affecting their quality of life'. CONCLUSION: At 7 months after vasectomy about 15% of previously asymptomatic men have some degree of scrotal discomfort. These early data indicate that chronic scrotal pain after vasectomy is a genuine entity, but a longer-term follow-up in this group will be important to allow further evaluation of how this pain develops with time. (Leslie et al, 2007) <br>  <br>  I actually emailed Dr. Leslie - He told me that 19 of the 488 men had testicular pain with intercourse - that's about 4% - too high to recommend the procedure.<br>  <br>  Here is another: PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective questionnaire-based study two groups of men were compared; 460 who had a vasectomy in 1991-92 (group A) and another 460 who had a vasectomy in 2000-1 (group B; 10 and 1 year after surgery, respectively). Data were collected on immediate complications, and the incidence and nature of chronic scrotal pain. Pain severity was graded using a visual analogue score (VAS). Patients were also asked if they regretted having a vasectomy because of pain. RESULTS: In all, 182 and 220 replies were received from patients in group A and B, respectively. Early complications included haematoma in five (2%) and two (0.9%) patients, respectively, and wound infection in 24 (13%) and 17 (7.7%). Eight patients who had scrotal pain even before vasectomy were excluded from the analysis (two in group A and six in group B). In group A, 25 of 180 (13.8%) had a new onset of scrotal pain of some nature, with eight (4.3%) having a VAS of > 5; one patient had an epididymectomy for this. Three of the 25 regretted having a vasectomy because of pain. In group B, 36 of 214 (16.8%) reported persistent scrotal pain, with 13 (5.9%) having a VAS of > 5. Six of the 36 regretted having a vasectomy because of the pain. The incidence of scrotal pain was not significantly different between the groups (P = 0.48, Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSION: Chronic scrotal pain after vasectomy is more common than previously described, affecting almost one in seven patients. All patients undergoing vasectomy must receive appropriate preoperative counselling about this. The incidence of this complication does not appear to increase with time.  BJU Int. 2004 Mar;93(4):571-4.<br>  <br>  Those two studies alone (there are many more) support my statistics. Why do I care? I run a support group for dozens of men with chronic pain after vasectomy. Only a few were told of the risk.|`|AA10494763	i had one almost two years ago and it was a great choice.

0TGpz08paa	My doctor had prescribed Seroquel for me..and the medication was helping me out on a daily basis. But I've had a hard life. I was physically and verbally abused by my dad, I was sexually abused by my grandfather, my dad tried strangling me, My mom attempted suicide so often, I've lost count. I was placed in group homes and foster homes. Everything added up together was too much for me to handle. So one day when I was in the group home, I took 70 of my seroquel pills. The people who worked there knew something was wrong, I couldn't even walk. They told me to go lie down in bed and the next thing I knew, there were police officers and the ambulance guys in my room and they were taking my blood pressure which was very low and they told me they were taking me to the hospital but I couldn't even keep my eyes open. They brought me down the stairs and strapped me to a gurney. In the ambulance I wanted to lie down and they kept me sitting up so that I wouldn't fall asleep and I just remember crying and screaming and when I got to the hospital, I was rushed in the E.R. There were a few doctors and nurses and they told me I had to drink a whole bottle of Charcoal which I couldn't even drink, I was so out of it. I tried leaving the room and I literally fell to the floor. Than they strapped me to a gurney and put a tube down me and pumped my stomach. I remember waking up over a day and a half later in a room with a security guard sitting by my bed. I wasn't allowed going to the bathroom alone, wasn't allowed eating with any utensils , nothing. I tried leaving the room and was restrained and they told me I was being admitted to the psych ward and I just cried and cried and screamed and I decided that if I couldn't leave, that I would starve myself until I died. So I literally didn't eat or drink and they had to restrain me and put me on i.v. I was hospitalized for a total of 9 weeks, and those 9 weeks were hard as hell but they saved my life. Without the wonderful doctors and nurses, I would be dead right now. My doctor told me that by taking 70 seroquel pills, I'm lucky to be alive. So If you need anymore information feel free to email me.|`|y9HO1dWsaa	You'd probably have your stomach pumped and have to stay in the hospital overnight.<br>  <br>  <br>  You most likely wouldn't have "wires" in you. haha =]|`|k0CYh4dlaa	Yes, I had wires in me to monitor me. Being in hospital for suicide are some of the longest and unpleasant night of my life. Longest because they wake you up every couple of hours to do your blood pressure and when they wake you up you can't get back to sleep and unpleasant because [I'm sure there are nurses that dont think like this] the nurses look at you like you dont deserve to be there because it's self inflicted and you can tell they dont wanna treat you. I remember the last time I was in I was being sick and she didn't offer me anything I had to ask for it and she injected it into my vein all at once really quickly and it felt like my vein was going to pop I was in agony and she didn't even apologise she just walked off. That is not really something you want after a night of feeling suicidal and then in the end actually doing it.|`|Y4s4Om38aa	Wires in your skin?<br>  <br>  I over dosed on sleeping pills trying to kill myself.   Spend the night in the regular hospital and then 2 weeks in the mental hospital.  Never had wires in my skin.........dont know why you even mean someone would.......unless you are thinking back to 70 years ago when mental health was virtually non existant and Drs were grasping at straws trying to figure out how to get the large populations locked in mental wards to be functioning members of society when their situation was completely hopeless.  Would be why lobotamys ended up being seen as such a great solution when they were first being done.  Then people MAY have had wires in their skin.   Otherwise, there is ECT treatments you may be thinking of, but even i dont think it involves wires in the skin(i could be wrong on that).  And it can not be forsed on someone from a suicide attempt......would take a lot of planing and making that desition with a Dr after trying many other means to treat severe depression.....could look into that a little bit more though.<br>  <br>  More acurately, If you overdosed, you get admitted to the hospital, to have stomach pumped or whatever needs done to make sure you dont die from it.....for me I happened to end up taking something that didnt have anything in it that was potentially seriously harmful.....and had already been 24 hours after my OD so was mostly flushed out of my system.....i was just  severely dehydrated from it so spent some time on IVs getting fluids back.  Once you are physicly well, you would be admitted to the psych ward of the hospital, or a psych hospital (there was actually a tunnel under the road conencting the psych hospital i was in to the main hospital).  Being admitted to the psych hospital/ward, You would be evaluated by a Dr to see if you needed to be there......on a suicide attempt they would say you did.......you would have a strip search (usually not invasive......mine was, take off my shirt and bra while nurse help a hospital gown up.....put the gown on....take of my pants and underwear.....nurse searched all my clothes to make sure i had nothing in them) to make sure you have nothing on you you can use to harm yourself or anyone else.  Then you would be taken to where you room was.  Days would be talking to counclers, and Drs, them figuring out whats going on with you, giving a diagnosis if appropriate, putting you on meds if they would help.  And once they think you are stable setting up a plan for your treatment after you leave the hospital.
b2nHnF49aa	It's pretty much a normal thing for 16 yr old boys to be horny and want to look at porn or at least Playboy mags. I think you should buy a magazine once in awhile. The internet is a tricky place. Quite harmful. But masturbating with books is a good release. When you fall for some girl, you may not even need to look at a pic.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	porn is great!!|`|6yZ85EY5aa	there is no such thing as a porn addiction. <br>  there is such a thing as an irresponsible habit.<br>  stay true to yourself and be cool.<br>  Respect your dna.|`|rgu5UZbLaa	you may have a problem with it that can only be cured by a support group.. i went through something similar and i am only 15 and a support group and encouraging friends made a big difference|`|0T6ympIvaa	NO i think your fine just look at it couple of times a week or so just don't let it interfere with your personal life|`|oiqNhzz1aa	an addiction requires that you need it to survive/function. You are not addicted so view away.|`|dSLCH5gHaa	no, most guys do it. chill and good for you you havent watched in over a year!|`|jqNhg4T2aa	For one thing, you're legally too young to even be looking at porn, but we'll let that slide. You are a teenager and it's natural for you to have a healthy interest in sex right now. It's only addiction if you are purposely neglecting other aspects of your life in search for whatever you are addicted to (like porn).|`|5BDGLCAuaa	same with me except i stopped watchin it for 2 weeks and went back on it.<br>  maybe your just curious again :)<br>  i mean you cant beat a hamshank every now and again..|`|d6d529942568e28c35ea74a1add8b085aa	Nothing wrong with looking at "Legal" porn from time to time. Few times a week maybe?<br>  <br>  Maybe more.
PcPswmv5aa	stay away from it.  You will get re addicted.  Like a gambler.  Best is not to look at it.  Good luck.. It is not a funny addiction and can be hard on your life.  And it could increase your chances of being a sex offender.  Good luck
Am2GSJfFaa	i've got the same problem!!! i was with my best friend on Sunday morning and she came down with the stomach flu on Monday morning.... Now i've got a stomach ache and stayed home from school today, just in case i'm getting it, too... :( Good luck and i hope you don't get it, too!!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	No such thing as the stomach flu.The most common stomach bug virus is Norwalk virus.<br>  <br>  It is possible that you might get sick...but it really depends.<br>  <br>  Good personal hygeine is a great prevention method (so basically, if your friend washes her hands and you wash yours, you have little chance of getting sick)<br>  <br>  The incubation period is about three days and you can stay contagious for up to a week after initial symptoms.<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|rff71wi4aa	just wait and see.<br>  you sound a little happy to be getting the stomach bug<br>  i heard it last 7 horrible days.<br>  good luck :)
r1Vg6djRaa	poeple say you dont get high the first time because the first time you smoke, you dont know the feeling..haha but you Do get high, lol. as you start to smoke more tho u start becoming more aware of it and how you feel when u do it..lmao<br>  anyways expect to cough ur as$ off and dont take too many hits if ur using a bong cause u dont have too much of a tolerance the first time and may totally freak out if u smoke too much<br>  start off slow the first time until you see what ur body can take<br>  haha and i reccommend you do it in a car with good speakers if your hotboxing cause man the music is beautiful when ur high..hahaha<br>  or do it at someones house were theirs a couch or a bed or something lol and MUSIC<br>  techno music is amazing when ur high.<br>  anyways have fun and dont get caught ;)|`|exMPHWKHaa	Ugh please ignore the ignorant answers like Woah its MT. She has no idea what the hell she is talking about. Go spread false myths elsewhere. Marijuana does not destroy your brain lol... Its less addicting then coffee too. You shouldn't expect too much your first time you might not even get high. You might get a little giggly and happy.|`|Lq2psnTqaa	3rd time is best.|`|ot0WW8lZaa	Don't listen to that idiot. Bud's great and you won't get addicted. I smoked everyday for 15 years and had to stop because my job started testing and had absolutely no problem stopping.<br>  <br>  What to expected(If anything, as a lot of people don't get zoot their first time):<br>  <br>  Everyone else says that they feel light headed when they smoked but personally I feel more heavy headed and tend to think about things more<br>  More thoughts going through your mind than normal<br>  Feeling happy, relaxed, chilled out<br>  Slight burning in the eyes if you're ****** up(due to red eye that bud gives you)<br>  And other than that it's pretty unexplainable. <br>  Please don't be one of those people that gets all hyper and annoying their first times like their on ******* uppers. Just chill-out and relax. And hot boxing is the ****, but you're gonna stink after. If your parents don't approve, be sure to bring some type of perfume, cologne and money for food. That's another feeling you'll get. Here's pretty much the sequence of events in simplest form. Basically you're gonna feel really happy, then really hungry, and then REALLY tired. However once you start smoking a lot the hungry and tired thing start to fade. I still get munchies but don't really get tired unless other substances were involved.|`|AA11482488	Like most people said, you don't get high the first time, it takes more than once.<br>  <br>  So, the situation you are putting yourself into is possession of illegal narcotics, you face possible jail time if you get caught and you get absolutely nothing out of it but smelly clothes and a sore throat.<br>  <br>  Makes sense to me...|`|l56Ezh72aa	weed just smoking and giggles finding evrythn funny maybe having a bad reaction and having a whitey and being sick you never know maybe munchies just be safe xxx|`|vdJfqTqIaa	Weed does NOT damage your brain in any way. Actually, it does just the opposite, which is promote neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells). You will only have short term memory loss while you're high, and that doesn't mean you'll forget things like what you did the day before, it just means that you'll forget something like what you were just talking about. I didn't get high my first time, but I've heard of people that have. You just have to smoke it correctly. The only negative effect that comes from weed is inhaling smoke, and you can avoid that by eating weed cookies or vaporizing your weed. So, the only thing you could possibly have to worry about is the legality of it. Just remember to be a responsible user.|`|pH3GSsI5aa	Disregard all these other people. Yes you will get high. It's a myth that you won't. The trick is to know that you're going to get high. If you don't think you are, you'll just resist it. Trust me, it's better if you just realize that you get high on the first time. <br>  <br>  Also, you may not think you need this, but don't try to inhale with your mouth. Everyone does at first. You have to use your chest to inhale, opening up your lungs. Hold it in for at least 3 seconds. You don't need to hold it in for more than 7, then you're just showing off.<br>  <br>  If you're hotboxing, remember to remove jackets and hats, anything that will smell a lot. A good way to get rid of the smell is to be outside. If you smoke outside, the only smell you need to worry about is your breath.<br>  <br>  If you're using a bowl/pipe/spoon, whatever you want to call it, only hold the lighter to it until it's lit. Holding the lighter there while you take a hit is called "torching it", and it's like running the sink while brushing your teeth. It's a waste of butane (the fluid in the lighter you will use), and some believe it makes you technically smoke butane.<br>  <br>  If they warn you about smoking out of tin/aluminum foil, just point out to them that butane doesn't burn hot enough to melt or burn aluminum or tin. It's only the paint you need to worry about. If you lose the bowl, don't have papers to roll a joint, and don't have any ideas, look up how to make an Apple Bong. It's easy, takes about 1 minute and doesn't require much skill. Good luck.|`|jcqa41rcaa	Most people don't get high on their first time because they dont know HOW to smoke pot. You gotta take a breath after you take the puff of weed and hold it in for at least 3 seconds. It's a lot of fun, you'll laugh a lot and just feel silly. The first time getting high is always the funniest.|`|xm0Bnl3Gaa	itll burn, you will cough a fair bit and you will probably dislike the taste. but assuming you smoke a decent ammount, and you smoke it properly you'll have mad fun. also i dont suggest hotboxing on your first time as stale smoke is good for making you feel sick.|`|Ef1oP9R0aa	the best time of your life...and i got baked on my first time to smoked but different people react differently...just dont get all nervous and paranoid just relax and have a good time...have plenty of green, food, good music, and cigarettes*(optional) and get ready for fun|`|Rr90QnpFaa	expect going to jail if you get caught. if you want to do it no one is gtoing to stop you but at least know the side effects and consequences.<br>  <br>  Anyway if you do it, dont go for anything stronger like coke or heroin.|`|obE9Md17aa	you dont get a high on your first time smoking. just do what feels comfortable for you. you will get a burning sensation but that is weed for ya. just be sure u dont get caught;)|`|OtbbKdITaa	You don't get high the first time.|`|Zn8WDzQHaa	some people say you dont get high your first time smoking it, like the other person who answered this question. I did so that blows that statement.....anyway uhh just like dont believe bull that people say who are just trying to mess with you. for example one of my friends first time the kid told him he couldnt eat his first time or he would puke. and your first time dont like be around other people like parents untill you learn to hide your high. i would say just kick back, realax with some food and soad to cure your munchies and kottonmouth, watch tv or a movie and enjoy the worlds most perfect plant!
oYmZUO8Caa	I would definitely suggest it - it's for a good cause plus your blood type is very rare. Instead of doing it at a blood drive or something along those lines, you CAN set up an appointment at a hospital. My bio teacher recommended this to me because it's a lot safer and cleaner.. plus the people know exactly what they're doing.|`|k1c8jCm6aa	It's really up to you. But having type o- blood, you can help a lot of people. Some people have had negative experience while donating blood while others don't. When I donated blood, I was fine with it but I got a bit dizzy afterward. You have to just try it out or you'll never know if you are okay with it or not. Just know that you are helping people out.|`|87756LlTaa	You'll find rude people everywhere you go.  Ignore them.  The need for donated blood is too high.  You may feel ill and weak afterward.  Be sure to eat well the day of the donation.  Drink water and juice.  Be sure to eat and drink after you donate, but before you leave the facility.  These feelings go away quickly.  Needles are never fun, but if your mom, sister, or friend ever needed blood, you'd understand that it is a small price to pay to save their lives.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|HiOwLqv4aa	I think that donating blood is for a good cause.  I personally have never because I dont meet requirements, but by donating, you could be saving lives.  Isnt that worth it?|`|3SJPp8Mkaa	Yeah u should<br>  1 you help people for a good cause <br>  2 you get money<br>  3 why not <br>  <br>  There all fabrication's what people say u can't get sick form donating but feeling weak that one thing u will feel weak because u just had blood taking out.|`|AA11913364	I have Type O negative blood, I donate as often as I can.  O negative is the universal donor, any blood type can use O negative if their type is not available.<br>  <br>  I have never had a bad experience donating blood.  Be use to eat and drink plenty of water and juice before you go.  The people I have dealt with have all been very nice and friendly.<br>  <br>  After the donation they will provide you will and snack and watch you for a few minutes to be sure you are alright.  I have never known anyone to have problems, maybe just a little lightheaded for a few minutes but that soon passes.<br>  <br>  Remember you may be saving a life, one of your family or friends.

BCzrcwKFaa	lol, he may just want to get you drunk.  the vitamin c in the apple juice would be beneficial, as well as the cinnamon surprisingly enough, but the everclear will just make things worse.  alcohol dehydrates your body, which is the opposite of what you want right now.  furthermore, the only germs drinking alcohol will kill is stuff in your mouth (maybe) and throat.  sorry :)|`|YfZYzHRlaa	no!! first off alcohol lowers your immune system and will only make the cold worse. While you may feel better that night in the morning, not only will you be hungover (everclear is very strong!), but your cold wouldnt have gotten better only worse.<br>  <br>  I recommend taking zicam, while its kinda on the expensive side (you have to take it like every 3-4 hours for a few days) it works wonders!<br>  <br>  Feel better :o]|`|xJZSpsRhaa	just take the vitamin C.  Apple Juice (from the carton usually contains TONS of sugar) isn't going to help.  Don't take any of those so called "Cough remedies".  THere fake.  All bugs don't need drugs.  You should just let the cold run its course.|`|AA11124885	no|`|LoKgkiuFaa	theres more vitamin c in orange juice + you wont get quite as drunk from that|`|bVbFAyzjaa	that might work, but just plain juice will do the same thing without giving you a hangover.|`|rlCCizGPaa	yes a wee bit, mate
pokbWiFQaa	I've had it for about 5 months now. I like it. Of course there is side effects each different in each person. I've actually had a period every month, but sometimes 2 to a month too. So that's not great, but Its so convenient to not have to worry with the pill. But i've gained like 15 pounds now too. Which isn't alot for me because i'm small anyways. I break out alot because it doesn't have estrogen in it to prevent that. But it doesn't bother me too much to get it taken out, It does cost alot though, hopefully you have insurance. But I'd recommend it...

dpgXzMenaa	You can feel menstrual cramps in a lot of different places sometimes... in your lower belly, across the front of your hips, in your lower back and even in your buttocks or down your legs.<br>  <br>  Your uterus is squeezing and sometimes sort of twisting, and that can be uncomfortable all by itself... but when it does that it can sometimes pull on the suspensory ligaments that hold it in position.  Those ligaments are attached to several other ligaments and muscles where they meet your pelvis, and a tug on any uterine ligament can sometimes make all the other tissues attached to the same area of the pelvis react as if *they've* been tugged at.<br>  <br>  That can cause pain that rates *really* high on the scale... but it doesn't happen to all women, and most have only some discomfort or minor to moderate pain.<br>  <br>  One simple and cheap way to help with cramps (it's also the quickest, and the most convenient and natural) is having an orgasm by masturbating.   It doesn't work for *all* women, but it does help many... and for some, it can get rid of cramps entirely for a while.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.h...</a><br>  <br>  "... an orgasm can cause your uterus to contract, enabling it to use up excess prostaglandins in the process. Prostagladins are hormones produced by your uterine lining. They help to stimulate contractions that move menstrual blood out of the uterus, and are also responsible for those cramps that occur throughout your period."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kadir-buxton.com/page8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kadir-buxton.com/page8.htm</a><br>  <br>  "Primary Menstrual Cramps can be a debilitating problem for some 10% of women. Conventional treatment can even be as drastic as exploratory surgery whilst looking for a cure. A less intrusive solution is available. Orgasm from masturbation has been found to relieve the painful symptoms of menstrual cramps. Whilst it is not always convenient to masturbate for the necessary five minutes until the pain subsides, hands free masturbation is still possible. In order to do this one simply has to clench and then relax the vagina repeatedly for five minutes. With this method no one need know of the discomfort being suffered, and the pain soon goes. "<br>  <br>  <a href="http://organizedwisdom.com/Masturbation_and_Menstrual_Cramps" rel="nofollow">http://organizedwisdom.com/Masturbation_...</a><br>  <br>  "The flexing and contracting of an orgasm basically relieves the cramp.  Reduces the intensity of the cramps.  Also eases some of the other symptoms of premenstrual syndrome."|`|iFTa9FqZaa	Well i get that too, but 2 aleve tend to help a bit. I've been prescribed 3 different pain killers and non do as much as 2 aleve every few hours. I have passed out before and vommitted because of the pain, also i get radiating pain in my thighs so they hurt terribly too. Well the best thing for me is to take the 2 aleve, take a hot bath, put on pjs and try to sleep or take a nap. I always feel better after the nap...not 100%, but way better than before. Another thing you could look into is birth control, it helps cut down your cramps and the blood in your period. I was prescribed bc a while ago, but it made me super depressed so i had to get off it. My doctor said that some girls just get bad cramps. Well good luck and feel better :)<br>  <br>  Just talk to your doctor about prescription pain killers or birth control if the aleve isn't good enough|`|EFnnqpbDaa	Every woman is different, I had a friend that fainted because her cramps got so bad, if drugs aren't working, than I'm not sure what you should do, but you might be able to see a doctor that could help you or give you something that would work. Best wishes and good luck! :)|`|22e2ae64861e33c2bed37fba9b020509aa	I used to have really bad cramps when I was younger!! To the point where I would be in bed crying all day!  While ibuprofen is a good option it sometimes doesn't help or help enough!  You could try a heating pad, I've heard exercise helps as well and I think that the times that I have been active it takes my mind of it and eases the pain.  Also you could take a hot bath---but I never found that to help much..just annoying to have to keep putting more hot water in when it gets cold lol!<br>  <br>  Another option is also go to a gynecologist about the option of birth control--it truly does help I take ortho-tri cyclen and I barely feel any cramps if any!  Of course depending on your age your parents might be freaked out about you wanting to get on birth control! However, there are places such as planned parenthood that offer free services and birth control and they do not contact your house.  <br>  <br>  I hope if I did not offer any useful advice to you someone does!!! I know how bad it can be!  Best of luck =]|`|ZzbjeoMyaa	Take midol and is that doesn't work take it up with your doctor. I would usually say tell your mom about this, but from the sounds of it, your situation is hard to ignor. I'm so sorry you have to go through this. Make sure you look online for different (preferably powerful) menstral pain or cramp realief. And your mom of all people could help you out the most. Use heating pads (miracle workers) and hot baths to *help* ease your pain and just hang in there. :)|`|KjiTQZzjaa	This happens to me all the time Don't worry. If this is your first month it's normal. and I know this sounds weird but try massaging kinda where you get cramps the most and put a heating pad on it!
1oBilGHuaa	Sometimes I am twitchy as well. I also try to keep it private.  I think the fact that we try to keep it private means we have some control over it.  It probably is psychological in origin. You may be feeling lots of stress/anxiety and this is how it is being released.  Try to figure out what might be causing you stress so you can find ways to relieve it.  Best Wishes to you.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	I suppose it could be neurological OR psychiatric, although seeing as you have control over it (hold back urges/do it privately), it's probably psychiatric. Get it investigated though - it's the only way to find out.|`|xUcjzYPdaa	I think tics associated with Tourette's are usually unconscious.<br>  <br>  The fact you know what you're doing suggests it's psychological rather than neurological, but I'd restrain from saying it's any kind of 'disorder'.<br>  <br>  If it's concerning you, please see your doctor. They are the only person who can tell you what it is.|`|cRdeb0T1aa	HOnestly, it sounds like tourettes.  Somebody in my support group commented once that it isn't the tics that are involuntary, it's the urges that are.  We can control it for short periods of time, but it's not easy.  It's easier to let it go.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like tourettes, talk to a neurologist about it!  And don't be afraid, it's normal, and it's not a problem.  It only affects you and your life if you let it.|`|qKGbvKe6aa	go to a doctor. you need to realize that they have seen and heard it all so you have nothing to be embarrassed about. they can help you by giving you options on how to control it. it may be a combination of both but mainly neurological

XoDUTquWaa	I believe it is. We have so many people here and still coming here from 3rd world countries which usually have no preventive vaccines. As long as this is happening I do think the government should regulate using the old methods. If not I am afraid we will suffer through many of the disease's we once thought were gone forever. If many of todays parents will not ensure our childrens safety our government needs too.|`|j0119zipaa	I don't know what things are like in other states, but where I live, children have to either show proof of vaccination, or have a signed exemption form.  If they have an exemption form, they are kept out of school if there is an outbreak.  Unfortunately I don't know how ethical it would be to force parents to give their children shots.  It's also unfortunate that there is so much bad press out there about vaccinations that are preventing many kids from getting shots, who would probably be perfectly healthy if they did receive shots.  These diseases hadn't been eradicated yet, but they were well on their way.|`|5q0Fhxpgaa	Of course it is.  The government may not know you individually, but they care about you.<br>  Especially Mr. Obama.|`|AA10450066	Definitely it is.How else would the CDC keep track of break-outs of these things in the first place.I believe the majority of people are all aware of what we are supposed to be immunized against in this country.But, then you have religion playing it's part where doctors hands are tied.There are also those that come into the country illegally and either can't or won't have their children immunized due to the fear of immigration.Even if they have free clinics those too are having to close do to the economy, so take all these factors and probably more into account then I wouldn't be surprised if this country doesn't have a health crisis in the future.

Most fractures cannot be diagnosed from a photograph, unless the fractured bone itself is actually visible, as in an open fracture.   You need to have your wrist examined by a doctor or specialist nurse and x-rayed if there is swelling, limited movement etc that would suggest a possible fracture.|`|XmoPuWWqaa	You need to have it x-rayed.

I found this natural herbal enhancer and figured what the heck,  if it's natural it must be great and plus it said no side effects.  I tried it and after about two days of taking it I was just horny like a mad man.  All the time,  I have erections that want to stand straight up and the orgasms are to die for.

AcY9JgJsaa	From a past acne suffer I would say that its not right to look at people and judge them from the outside.  Having acne makes you way self conscious and it kills your self esteem so she may feel less than her clear skin counterpart.  So I say no she would still be attractive, but what I find "pretty," "beautiful," and "attractive" is the actual person, their heart and soul.  I actually think this world would be better if there was no mirrors or anything that promotes false beauty.|`|fowe4EPpaa	Personally, I would prefer no acne. If you cover it accurately I don't see why the acne twin couldn't be prettier though.|`|obE9Md17aa	some people would see the twin without acne prettier but they dont really know her. acne is normal and every teen gets it. the twin with acne is still pretty because i bet they have a good personality. people should see beauty from within not from the outside.|`|BCzrcwKFaa	clear skin is one of the characteristics that we find attractive in the opposite sex.  that's not to say that a person with acne isn't attractive, but if all things were identical then, yes, the person with clear skin would be more attractive physically.|`|YsWiDqGeaa	well honestly sometimes i dont even notice that people have acne.. its just a part of their face... sooooo its like decoration.. ha|`|LzNzgU8Faa	idont think so i know some one with acne and she looks really attractive!

8bQkJ2Zjaa	It seems like people here are going a little too in detailed with blood pressure and chronic illnesses. Yes, I would be aware that it could be a number of things.<br>  <br>  I've been a diabetic for over 15 years-it sounds like a case of low blood sugar. Sometimes this happens to people who DON'T have diabetes as well, so don't get worried! Depending on the last time you ate, what you ate, and how much, and maybe even the night before, your body was responding to a basic instinct-to get sustenance as soon as possible. This also happens to kids who play sports a lot, exercise,or are very active. My friend has the exact same effect-he works at UPS all day, and by the time he gets home, he is shaking and starving. But he doesn't have diabetes, hypoglycemic or anything. If you felt shaking  drastically, like someone says "seeing stars" or  just in plain terms HUNGRY, it may have been low blood sugar. It definitely sounds like it because probably about 5 to 10 min after you ate-you felt better, and maybe even a little tired like you just ran around.<br>  <br>  Again, just my opinion, but low blood sugar wouldn't just appear on bloodwork, especially because this may have been the only time.<br>  <br>  If this happens often, I would ask my doctor. However, if it only happened once, I wouldn't be too worried at all. Wait for the blood work to come in for your thyroid, and see what the results for you. The best to you!|`|d2a3834786860b34ae904f14b9d846faaa	Low  Blood Sugar.  <br>    The same thing  has happened to me  many times,   and it has always   been  "low  blood  sugar"     When a person does not eat or drink  for   3 to 4 hours,  they commonly get  shaking and feel faint. <br>  <br>     Blood  tests  will not  show  "low blood sugar:<br>     Just  eat  something every  3  hours and you  will  likely be just fine.|`|kbjjbDPXaa	Problably low blood sugar, I do that alot, did you see stars, and feel faint like, I have low blood sugar  alot, so eat something, and see if it happ|`|ZNbauLJzaa	sometimes people don't feel good.

Things that raise it up are<br>  salt, chocolate, coffee, booze but those are temporary.  The salt + choc. of lunch could fix you.  <br>  Now be careful about eating cashew nuts, they drop it down, so be supervixed if you eat them.<br>  There is no nice fix for chronic low blood pressure, but a licorice capsule - sold at health and nutrition shops - may give you a much better fix than that junk food.  don't forget that white flour (the bagel) breaks down quickly to sugar and can cause reactions.  Please try whole wheat. Force yourself. You'll get used to it.  You have a wonderful life ahead.  I'd see a naturopath  NOT a doctor as they work WITH your bodies unique needs to keep you well with food instead of forcing symptoms away with chemicals.  Love to you, and all the best!

The choice is totally up to you.|`|dcb0c032d3b6c037f3cfdb4dac72663eaa	Well that's kinda weird. Has this happened before? Why do you have an old brace? Do you have an old brace because your arm got sore before? Can't you think of anything that brought this on? Like a sport? Do you think you might be sleeping with it in a crooked position? Since it hurts a lot, has hurt for 3 days, and is getting worse instead of better,  I think you should go to the doctor and get it checked out. He might still have you use a brace or a sling but he will know how to do it properly and he might also tell you to put heat on it or take an anti-inflammatory med.  <br>  <br>  I think you should go to the doctor.<br>  Get well soon!<br>  P.S.

I waited 2 days and the pain kept getting worse so I went to the doctor and had slight fracture in my radius. So what you can do is maybe wait one more day to see if the pain keeps increasing because it might just be a bad sprain or bruise or who knows? But if the pain keeps increasing then definitely go to doctor. <br>  <br>  P.S. Check for any bumps or even slight bends in your arm because these are also signs of broken bones...Best of Luck to You!!! xD
ufgv7oTjaa	The main negative is the risk of addiction. Simply put, if you take them too often, your body can get used to it where it won't be able to fall asleep without the pill. That's probably why she was upset.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, there are popular and effective natural sleep aids that don't have a risk of addiction, but they are generally only recommended if you are 18 or over (due to various issues with the delicate body chemistry of growing minors).<br>  There's Melatonin, Valerian, Chamomile, Hops, L-Tryptophan, L-Theanine, Passionflower, and Scullcap (an herb). Many adults get help from any one of those to help you sleep naturally.

87756LlTaa	There is a long list of medical criteria to meet before being diagnosed with ADHD.  It sounds like you could possibly have ADD (w/o the hyperactivity component).  While ADHD is diagnoses in millions of kids, most actually do not have it according to medical criteria.  You should see your doctor.  I would recommend non-medication treatments first, because the meds used to treat ADHD today and potentially very dangerous and addictive.  As an MD, I DO NOT diagnose ADHD unless a patient meets the criteria.  I'm one of the few who do not advocate for drugging our children (or adults for that matter).  There are lots of behavioural treatments that work very well, and may work for you as well.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|XLnboFslaa	I have a friend that has ADHD and he does all of that stuff.

dpgXzMenaa	Everyone can (and everyone deserves to) enjoy the pleasure of orgasm, including everyone who chooses to enjoy it alone instead of (or in addition to) having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure.  It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation.  You will *definitely* know when you have one.  There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The whole time, it's just about the best feeling there is.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|hswTS1jVaa	Just do what feels good to you. Experiment until you find something you like.|`|QmvYGkNJaa	Wow, when I was young NOBODY talked about that; you're lucky your friends are talking about it, because I had no idea!<br>  <br>  IF YOU'RE A GIRL -<br>  Just have a play and see what feels nice for you. Find your clitoris and use your fingers on it until it feels nice. Use some lubrication and it wil feel even nicer. You can use KY Jelly; anything that's water based.<br>  <br>  IF YOU'RE A BOY - <br>  Wrap your hand around your penis and move it up and down.

jUWOMgyuaa	That happened to me when I was in 7th grade<br>  This kid a lot of girlfriend, and he and I were best-friends, and I liked him so much. I talked to him on the phone, online, we sat together in every class. Whenever he hugged me I felt crazy. I got over him after a year, when I got a boyfriend, because he took my mind off of him. Soon enough, my "love", well, more like infatuation with him was gone, and I never talk to him, so. <br>  Get a hobby, or a boyfriend. Hangout with your friends a lot, it'll help, trust me<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped you :D :D|`|kBp9IzQqaa	Um, I don't feel like reading that.|`|w29tsXLUaa	It was too long long to read all of it.

hIzQyflqaa	6 months|`|gSo4dR7oaa	More than 98% of people who have HIV would test positive within 3 months after infection.  In very rare cases, it could take up to 6 months for someone to test positive.
FicyC2TXaa	The early stages of cervical cancer do not usually cause symptoms. <br>  <br>  More advanced cervical cancer does cause symptoms, including bleeding after sexual intercourse,  bleeding between menstrual periods, bleeding after the menopause,  an unusual discharge,<br>  discomfort or pain during sex.<br>  <br>  A woman who experiences any of these should see her doctor straight away. BUT - they can all be caused by other conditions and often are.
Kpn4FnuSaa	7 months ago I went to my 3rd dermatologist for a 3rd opinion and a last shot at clearing up a 4 yr run of acne.  Get off the tetracycline and talk to your derm about taking accuante and in 6 months your skin will be 100% clear.<br>  <br>  I no longer have any acne at all. :)
0gChS7z8aa	Is the weight because of fat or muscle? If it's muscle, then you don't need to lose weight. If it's fat, then you should exercise more and eat healthier foods without lots of fat, grease, or sugar. You play lacross even when there's snow on the ground? I thought lacross started in March or April.|`|n4uffXEtaa	Weight watcher and counting your calories. u will loose weight!!!
DkVofG9paa	Oh jeez.  i would say it would be some type of disorder she has.|`|upvLAyyzaa	Yeah, it's an anxiety issue.  I have the bad habit of pulling out my eyelashes too...only when I'm wearing mascara though.  Weird, right?  I hate it, so I try not to wear mascara because if I don't, I won't bother my eyelashes.  And as far as biting my nails.  Well I got sick of my nails looking like crap so I got fake ones.  But then I got sick of paying for them, they're kind of expensive, so I took them off thinking ohhh they've been on for a long time, I'm not going to start biting my nails again...BUT I DID, but not as much as I used to.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	Pulling out your own body hair is called trichotillomania. Biting nails is a habit she's got into. Both of these are likely related to stress and anxiety. You could consider becoming friends with her and then mention it one day and ask if there's anything she's particularly worried about or if there's anything you can do to help her.|`|vqtpF1Q5aa	It could be anxiety...I use to do it and I didn't realize what I was doing in all honesty. I was actually picking my mascara clumps off my eyelashes and I had on occassion pulled some out to the point where I had to go and get the ones at the store for replacing individual areas....<br>  <br>  From what you have stated about her then most likely it's a nervous habit. I also bit my nails when I was younger and now wear fake ones and have for 17 years so I have pretty nails.....always had short ones before.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about her you might try talking to her about it and see if you can help her. Sometimes people don't even realize little habits like that they have and talking to someone could help....<br>  <br>  ~ I hope this helps  =)|`|4juunPpoaa	Aaah, sorry but I don't remember the name but this is a type of disorder were sufferers pull out their eyelashes and eyebrows and bite their nails and do other things. That would be my best guess at what it is|`|HQ5R1p9qaa	its from OCD not anxiety. its common for people with OCD to pull out their eyelashes when they're upset
XmoPuWWqaa	It sounds to me like a bad sprain. A sprain is ligament damage, and can be quite serious. I would go and get it looked at, as it could possibly be broken, although if you can walk on it, that indicates it isn't broken, but best to get it checked out to be on the safe side. In the meantime, I would elevate it above your hips to reduce any swelling, and ice for pain and swelling. <br>  <br>  Good luck
DkFoX4pHaa	Simple solution.   Gently wash with cold water only - without any soap - your anus with a soft cotton cloth, after wiping each time, and pat dry with soft cloth.    Do not sit in a tub to bathe and never use hot water or soap on your anus.  Do not wipe hard, only gently.  Gradually the piles (hemorrhoids) will shrink and you will be comfortable again.   It may take a week or two, depending on the condition, but you will neve have to spend a dime for ointments or doctors.   Your anal ring prefers cold, pure water for healthful cleanliness. <br>  Be kind to your anus and it will be kind to you.   It sure beats a visit to the doctor for an avoidable condition.|`|AA10045887	I assume, pun intended, your joking right?<br>  A doctor removes them or burns them with lazer treatment, not with a "sewage pipe".<br>  Buy some medication at your local drug store for piles, such as Preparation H for hemorrhoid's.  Also buy stool softener pills they won't make you go, but they will help you from straining.|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	You can try but you should definitely cut your fingernails first!|`|K86lVxP8aa	That's hilarious.|`|7NtMbVCJaa	nope ...i wouldnt try it....go 2 the chemist and gget cream fro it.
6fvR8J9Kaa	after 3 or 4 weeks you will have your next period, it may not be the exact date which is normal so it might come a few days earlier or a few days later. <br>  it is normal to have irregular period patterns at the beginning but you should always double check with a doctor or pharmacist, ask your mum for advice too - she will be willing to help you.|`|lEdBY8Chaa	every 3 months it will come back then the 4-5 time it has done it your cycle will ajust and happen every month|`|EFnnqpbDaa	Well, I've never heard of a period lasting for two weeks, but it is probably just your body adjusting. In which case it is normal to not follow a pattern at first. I don't know when it will come back but you shouldn't worry as it will be irregular for the first couple of years. -Eventually it should even out to have 28 days in between each period-<br>   Good luck! :)|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	You shouldn't have anything to worry about your period won't be consistent until you've had it for a few years. Unless of course you're sexually active then you might want to go to the Dr. And still you can go to the Dr. if it's really worrying you and he will be able to give you medication that'll straighten things out :)|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	The average time between a woman's period is 28 days. But, it could be different for you. Calculate when that is from the last day of your last period so you can carry around or wear a pad on the day you suspect it might come so you aren't caught out.|`|q5qFLvnvaa	well you just satrted so it will take a while to get regular so you shouldnt be worried.|`|aXsy5lEVaa	oh don't worry it'll come back. i got mine the august before going into grade 8 and it didn't come back till december. Your period will probably be irregular for the first year or two but you'll still get it again. consider yourself lucky you don't have it every month. it's compleatly normal.|`|GSEslPnTaa	oh yes, this is completely normal especially because you just started menstruating.  As soon as you know it it will be coming regularly every month and you will know exactly what to expect. Everything will get better soon. Oh and when it will come back could be any time, its really nothing to worry about|`|NAxxsqslaa	well it's normal just make sure you always have spare tampons with you in your purse to avoid some pretty bad situations, goood luck :)|`|1TX8wwB8aa	ITS YOUR 1ST TIME SO IT WILL B NORMAL NEXT TIME AND PERIODS CHANGE UP FROM TIME TO TIME SO JUST LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF IT LIKE BLOATING,CRAMPING,BACKACHE ,MOOD SWINGS
4eIpLee6aa	It could be because your clothing (underwear included) is too tight which is the most common cause.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you really should consult with a doctor to make sure everything else checks out fine even if you are STD-free. A doctor can give you a more proper evaluation and advice.|`|6lmFyr2maa	umm i dont have a penis so im no expert but maybe your reducing the blood supply/ cutting off the circulation.<br>  <br>  xxx
fQh5Qkkkaa	why catnip? just get some mary jane. <br>  but i suppose you could try smoking more of it.|`|9HHvi3H2aa	catnip has no chemicals which alter your body or state of mind in any way. it is purely a psychological high, akin to the "contact high" people get when being around people who are stoned.|`|L3ucoaNIaa	your a ******* idiot.. CATNIP?!?|`|Ef1oP9R0aa	for 1 dont smoke that **** it is a waste of time and health....2 depending on if you are a smoker or not you could have had a buzz from nicotine bc it sure as **** wasnt the catnip....3 smoke weed without tobacco and enjoy yourself with a high not a shitty buzz
AA10045887	I am afraid your out of luck - I never heard anything.  But did you know that they do make a condom that only covers the head of he penis and not the shaft? That might help.|`|1AWywas5aa	No, there's no procedure that can be done.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't personally like it either when my boyfriend ejaculates in me. But at the same time, I'm not a big fan of condoms. Best thing to do is either use a condom, have him "pull out", or just have sex til YOU orgasm then suck him off til he goes. :)|`|fJA6bTmkaa	I know this may be a touchy subject, but tell him to try the "stop and go" masturbation method.  This is basically masturbating until almost orgasming, but stopping, waiting, and repeating.  This causes much more control before orgasm.
IM3QwSS2aa	Every session of sexual intercourse, every session of a jack-off will vary the time men ejaculate.  very normal.<br>  <br>  /Jerome|`|H2IqzG12aa	Yes.  The longer the better, since when it's over, it's over.  Until next time.|`|OBV4AKIXaa	yeah it depends on how long its been since the last time you came<br>  <br>  and how horny you are|`|d6d529942568e28c35ea74a1add8b085aa	yep , normal.|`|cxVuLIKdaa	yes it is
Xy1XH5gVaa	Don't take them at all. The horrible side effects aren't worth it, they made me worse. It also affects your sex life (in a bad way).|`|uJKTR4d2aa	You can die.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	They are basically designed so it'll make you sick - and not kill you.<br>   <br>  One thing a person on antidepressants would tend to do is commit suicide... and if you give them meds, they might take them to do it.  I think all it'll do is make you sick.|`|1AWywas5aa	I've taken two whole bottles of it at once one time. All that happened was I puked a couple times then slept for a day and a half.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most psychiatric medication is formulated to be hard to overdose on.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	No. It depends how many is too many. But I advise against it because it'll probably be the worst experience of your life.

1amIygQJaa	well there are a lot of ways you could get it. i think i got it because i had really bad bronchitis and my symptoms came after that. i also think it could be genetic (mines not) but i also think it is just the way some people are. they just have weaker lungs. my symptoms were a constant dry cough, sore chest (sometimes), and it was hard to breathe during gym. there are different ways that it can be treated. most of the time with a regular rescue inhaler but there are also steroid inhalers which i have. but the thing that works best for me especially with a cold or something is getting a breathing treatment. you could probably find a lot more if you just type something into google but i hope i helped.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Asthma is not an acquired disease. It is also known as hyperreactive airway disease. Your body normally reacts to certain irritants when they are inhaled. Pollen, fumes, smoke whatever. Asthmatics overreact and their lungs shut down. It is a life threatening illness but can managed by your doctor so well you might not even know you have it except for the inhaler in your pocket. <br>  There are various degrees of asthma. But in no case is smoking recommended.
EeTs9DqUaa	You have a good chance becoming diabetic.  You need to watch the amount of carbs you eat as they can cause you to spike and then crash.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Who says you are hypoglycemic?  Are  you just assuming it because you feel light headed and have other vague symptoms?  Have  you seen an endocrinologist for this?  Hypoglycemia is a symtom of something, it's not a disease or condition that stands alone. <br>  <br>  There is no food that causes diabetes.  Eat carbs all day and all night, if your pancreas works, you'll metabolized the carbs.  If you are overweight and inactive, you have a higher chance of becoming diabetic with type 2.  If you have a family history of diabetes, you have a higher chance of suffering from diabetes at some time in the future.|`|dJ2shbJIaa	my mom was like that for many years but she is now a diabetic.

Do light weights on you're legs. Its like toning. Good luck hope this helps|`|wipJ9OE7aa	Well, My calves are large-17 inches around, so I understand how you feel. When I was younger I hated it, people use to always say... look how big her legs are, guys in high school use to ask if I ran track or something? they use to point, etc., but later on I found out that many of them liked them. If it's all muscle like mine are, it's not really going anywhere. I decided that I would change my attitude about how I feel about my legs because in the end I am thankful that I have them. There are many people out their who do not have the ability to walk, don't have limbs, etc., so I think that you should learn to love them, embrace them, and flaunt them.

The chocolate diet includes some controlled absorptions during the day that will help you to have that delicious feeling and lose weight at the same time.<br>  <br>  There is no question here of taking chocolate, pasta and pop corns every day but of healthy balanced menus for two weeks containing an unstopping variety of foods: dairy products, fruits and vegetables, starchy foods, meat and fish, etc.<br>  <br>  The principle is to play on the light but by agreeing chocolate and a small pleasure sometimes to hold over the duration and not to feel frustrations. It promises between 2 and 6 pounds a week according to the weight to lose
ZLt8TwOiaa	It is probably a yeast infection. you can get ointment at the pharmacy to get rid of it|`|Hq6nSl1Qaa	There are two things that come to mind regarding your description.  Both of them are infections.  First, candida infections (yeast), can produce "white cheese"-like pieces and can have minimal to strong odor, depending on what time of the month it is.  Second, HPV infection will also cause this.  HPV is one of the most common STDs in female populations with estimates ranging over 25% of women infected.  You should be tested for HPV as this STD can lead to various types of cancer, including cervical.  If you are not infected, then you should consider Gardasil.<br>  <br>  An anti-yeast vaginal medication can help correct the issue if this is the cause - or the cheese formation continues and is accompanied by inflammation and tenderness.  Maintaining proper vaginal pH is the best deterrent to yeast infections.  This is done with natural bacteria, such as L. acidophilous.  These microbes are fairly ubiquitous and supplementation can improve long-term vaginal health by altering body flora.  Candida is a fairly common microbe found in a person's mouth, so having someone go down on you, douching a lot, or having a lot of sex can alter pH and healthy bacterial ratios.<br>  <br>  If the issue continues, go to you OBGYN and get tested for HPV.  There are also over-the-counter tests available now that can help determine if your issue is candida related.

AA11414292	DO NOT go by what people tell you her go and see your doctor as diet is different for every one.<br>  What suits one may not be good for you> So stay healthy and live a long and happy life.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	This is tough for a kid (and adults too!), but you need to keep your carbs under 30-35g per meal, and you'll lose a pound or so per week.  Nice and easy.  Load up on lean meats, veggies, and lean cheeses, and you won't feel hungry.  Insulin is partially stored as fat, so the more you take, the more resistant to weight loss you'll be.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, DON'T run your BG's high on purpose or neglect your shots in order to keep your weight down.  I did that when I was a teenager and it's my biggest regret.  I will be paying for that for the rest of my life.  Good luck.|`|6adc597e9fb33038cff31ccea702d7bcaa	Are you a type 1?  I'm thinking exercise and more vegetables which will cause you to need less insulin.  But your other responder is right, you need to check with your endo before starting on a diet.  Especially at your age.|`|ZHm0807kaa	hey, im fifteen and in the same boat.<br>  drs and dietitian have said the best way of doing this is cutting right down on insulin and portion sizes.<br>  you need to make sure you dont have too much insulin so you dont hypo and have to eat.<br>  good luck :)

5qIOzchwaa	well, worrying extra doesn't help you. I doubt it was a heart attack (not saying it wasn') it was probably an anxiety or panic attack, those have symptoms similar to a heart attack. when my grandpa had a heart attack his left arm got really tingly and he was really weak. That sounds like a panic attack to me. My dad would get those sometimes, he'd sweat a lot and have to sit by a fan and gasp for breath because he couldn't even breathe. these can also lead to heart attacks so either way you really need medical help with this to learn how to control it so it doesn't take over your life or lead to more severe problems in the future.|`|NrOg2hrZaa	I agree with North510's answer.|`|AA11729534	You should ONLY be asking a doctor that.

FpkMJFKDaa	Oh my, you have no idea how much I can relate. I have struggled with anxiety for a few years now, and I can now live with it pretty well. I still have my moments, but I know how to better control and live with it. To use it to my advantage at times, even. But I remember how terrible it was when I first began dealing with it... At one point, I thought there was nothing left but for me to die. :/<br>  First off, I just want to say, if you don't want to be put on a drug for it, then don't let them prescribe you any.<br>  A psychiatrist tried to put me on several different types of anti-depressants, which was somehow supposed to help my anxiety, but taking drugs was actually part of what brought anxiety for me. Not only that, I didn't like the idea of being dependant on something like that to keep my anxiety under control, I wanted to learn to deal with it on my own. You CAN learn to deal with it on your own. And you will become a much stronger person in the process. If you take a drug for it, all I can see it doing is making you think that you need or in order to function normally. What happens when the time comes that you need to get off of them? Is your anxiety problem going to creep up again and grab ahold of your life? It hardly seems worth it to me, facing it head on is a better option.<br>  I know that this probably isn't helping you much, but it's just that, there's so much I could tell you that I don't know where to start. So if you have any specific questions, feel more than welcome to ask me, I'm 18 as well and have been dealing with this since I was 16.<br>  It might help to know, though, that you're not alone, and you will become stronger.<br>  I went to a councelor for a while when I was really having trouble with it all, and she gave me some really good advice for when the panic attacks would start coming on.<br>  She said to repeat to yourself in your head, that it's temporary. This feeling is temporary.<br>  That helped me when I was having the attacks. Also, small things like putting your head between your legs and even breathing into a paper bag really can help with hyperventilating!<br>  <br>  I know this feels so negative now, but it can help you so much when you learn how to control it. It's probably impossible to think that way yet, but it can become a positive experience for you. I hope this helped at least a tiny bit. I would like to search for websites as well to help you, but I'm in school right now and I don't have time. :(|`|MnCxObjlaa	Hi I have the same problem. First thing that helps with anxiety is to remember to do some deep breathing exercises this will help to calm your mind and get your bloodflow right. Sometimes Anxiety can be caused by the dumbest little things that you do. Maybe certain things you do on a daily basis are triggering this anxiety.|`|uP9kMqVOaa	I had a really bad panic attack problem about 2 years ago. I was on zoloft for about a year, I really did not want to get on medicines. It honestly was the best choice for me though. It helped me learn on my own to deal with the problems. It was a great way to end the problem quickly, and I eventually just eased myself off the medications. I got to the point where I wasn't driving. What was causing my panic attacks was the fear of passing out, having a seizure, or choking...even though I have never experienced any of these EVER. But it led me not to be able to drive, because I would get really scared in situations where I was not in control. Once I realized it was all in my head, and I had to deal with it, I eventually overcame it. What also helped me was I went about every 2 weeks to a psychologist to figure out why I was so scared, we never did determine, but all in all it helped. I am better for the most part. I think in the last 2 years I've had maybe 3-5 small panic attacks. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope you can figure out the best solution to your problem. Because I know it is def. never fun to live with anxiety.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	I've had severe anxiety for almost a decade and I hate to say that in my experience, the best relief came from taking an ssri antidepressant. But I totally understand your reservations. I had the same reservations too, and actually resisted taking it for 6 years. When I did finally take it I had a horrific time with side effects and had to come off it after almost a year. I wish I could go back on it because it worked very well for the anxiety and phobias, and I started to get my life back.<br>  <br>  I used Lexapro btw.<br>  <br>  I wish I could find a good alternative to meds, but so far I haven't had much luck.

6NZeItMAaa	Our diet is too rich in fat as well as calories, refined sugars, starches, and oils. At the same time, it is low in essential nutriments, minerals and other vital requirements. We are all agreed: the cholesterol found in the blood is made largely in the liver from fats in the diet. It is also believed that cholesterol is produced in the arterial walls themselves. But the main source and the one that we can to a great extent control is fat in our food.<br>  <br>  We should avoid all saturated fats and have 2 spoonful of vegetable oils a day. These fatty acids are very effective in reducing the fats and the cholesterol present in the blood stream. They are thus "protective" against the harmful effects upon the arteries of other fats, such as contained in butter, milk, eggs, and cream.|`|AE3lv4pRaa	Vital as it is to good health, cholesterol can be a killer. Eating too much over a period of years can deposit plaque on the inner walls of arteries and veins, shutting off blood flow and causing heart attacks or strokes. For this reason, many authorities recommend keeping your intake under 300 milligrams per day. (That's the amount in one and a half egg yolks, three ounces of beef liver, or eight tablespoons of butter.) In its September 2002 report on macronutrients, however, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) pointed out that people need no cholesterol in their diet and "any incremental increase in cholesterol intake increases coronary heart-disease risk."|`|Dtu4j99xaa	CHOLESTEROL Guidelines and Daily Allowance:<br>  <br>  The Australian National Heart Foundation advised that all people should restrict total cholesterol consumption to no more than 300 milligrams a day, that's their cholesterol guideline for daily allowance. The University of Texas, USA, in discussing those with high cholesterol, suggests a limit of 200 milligrams a day.<br>  <br>  Going below 100 milligrams a day may run risks with your health, as cholesterol is necessary in our blood for good health to be maintained, but the liver can apparently produce cholesterol when it is absent from the diet, so zero cholesterol should be fine, provided your liver is working well. But as cholesterol exists in so many different foods in our food chain it is not possible to achieve a zero cholesterol guideline. We may be able to limit our cholesterol daily intake and that's about the best we can do.<br>  <br>  To learn more abut cholesterol and related information, please visit,<br>  <a href="http://www.cholesterolcholestrol.com/cholestrol-cholesterol-guidelines.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cholesterolcholestrol.com/cho...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cholesterolcholestrol.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cholesterolcholestrol.com/</a>

ztrRs62Daa	Umm, it seems your teeth have sort of changed a lot since you were 12. It is not too late to get braces or if you have the cash and you think it seems right for you, you can get your teeth straightened at cosmetic dentists. This is probably more to do with you being self-concious of your teeth than you physically not being able to show your teeth.. I'm not suggesting you need to get your teeth straightened or whatever it is they do to them, but you're obviously unhappy with the way they are now so this is definitely worth considering. You'd probably be much more inclined to grin with some nice straight gnashers. Talk to your regular dentist about this or alternatively get a consultation with a cosmetic dentist.. They are probably free but I don't know how much it would cost to get your teeth straightened..<br>  <br>  But anyway, you shouldn't let that get you down. We all have our hang-ups, they make us self-concious but you just gotta deal with it and think 'I am who I am, like it or lump it'. But if you don't wanna lump it then, like I say, you could try getting them straightened.

I notice many females on Y!A post questions regarding mood swings with Microgynon. Generally, most side effects are just experienced for the first few months and get better over time. If you have been taking it for a year, it is unlikely things are going to improve now. <br>  <br>  If it is making you depressed and you see no other reason why you should be depressed or feeling low then see your GP and he will likely change you to another Pill. There is no 'one suits all' pill. It's trial and error. <br>  <br>  High blood pressure which is the result of the contraceptive pill is known as secondary hypertension.

It may be building up the tension too much that you can only last about 2 minutes. Hope that helped!|`|HEmJ4auCaa	Use masturbation as a way to train yourself to last longer before you ejaculate. Bring yourself to the edge of ejaculation - then exercise your will-power and stop! Do this with dedication and focus, so that you don't tip over into ejaculation. If you allow your arousal to drop, then resume masturbation, and repeat the same process several times, you will not only become more aware of your "point of ejaculatory inevitability", but you will also develop the skill of knowing when to stop stimulation during sex so that you don't ejaculate and can last longer in bed. What this means in practice is stopping thrusting when you feel you are approaching the point of ejaculation. To last longer, you then need to remain motionless for a while until your impending ejaculation has faded, and then you can resume thrusting.|`|wfAUbyhCaa	well im 16 bro.<br>  and im also sexually active.i dont suggest not using a condom.the easiest way to go is check out this condom called durex performa max.it has a little anestia in it so it makes u last longer.plus it is thin and doesnt irritate.<br>  <br>  okay and now.without a condom..just when you feel like your about to ***..make a ring shape out of your pointing finger and thumb around near you head and keep firm pressure on your spermicidal cord.this is an exercise you can practice and within 6 weeks you should notice a change.|`|ngHumYxvaa	Chill dude, are you ever stressed? because that can cause iritation, and also when you are old enough take vikazine its a new pill that helps with your problem, ask your doctor, before taking this, and it may cause swelling, vomiting, head aches, as well death in EXTREMLY RARE CASES!|`|1EXAZMnLaa	dude you might as well just put the bullet in your brain now. this will never end for you, leading to years and years of embarassment and chronic masturbation.

AA10299265	I had no noticeable symptoms when I was diagnosed. <br>  <br>  When in doubt... check it out. <br>  <br>  It's easy. <br>  <br>  A simple blood test... will put this thing to rest.|`|iK3YYRaTaa	Many people are diagnosed with diabetes and have no symptoms at all.It's a fade amoung young people. But once you have it you will really regret it. It is a lifestyle change that you will never overcome. You will pray for the day that you was diabetes free. And once you have it, its forever.<br>  <br>  Good luck>|`|hdtNLIIwaa	those are some symptoms, but do not definitely mean that you have diabetes. the only way to know for sure is to go to a doctor.  if you think you may have it, you should definitely go to a doctor just to check, because you'll need to get your health under control as soon as possible. if you test negative, then at least you will know it isn't that and can explore other options of what may be causing those symptoms.  <br>  <br>  when you go to a doctor, he'll probably perform a fasting blood glucose test.  you're doctor will tell you what to do, but the basics are that you won't be allowed to eat for 8 hours before the test, and your blood glucose will be tested - typically they will prick your finger and take a drop of blood.  Normal results will be a blood glucose level of 70 - 100.  Two separate tests will need to show a level of 126 or higher to be diagnosed with diabetes.  there is also "pre-diabetes" if your level is 100-125, which is important to know so you can make some health changes to avoid getting diabetes.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you should talk to your doctor about this, just in case. better safe than sorry.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	People who have diabetes, but have not been diagnosed yet are generally very ill.  So ill that your parents would have you at the doctor. Teens lose weight quickly without even trying because you are growing so fst.  Dizziness really isn't a sign of undiagnosed diabets.  Peeing a lot, if it was due to undiagnosed diabetes would also have you quite sick because this is from very high blood sugar.<br>  <br>  I think it is unlikely that you have diabetes.  It isn't a subtle thing when it comes on.  If you asked people here about how they felt before the diagnosis, you'd see that their symptoms were quite a bit more severe than peeing a lot some days.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	I believe that you can have several but not all diabetic symptoms to have it.   I had most, but not all.<br>  <br>  Something is definitely wrong and I suggest you go to a chemist or GP where they will give you a blood test - after 8 hours of fasting.  No food after 12midnight and you could then get your bloods done at about 8 or 9.  <br>  <br>  If you are worried about needles you can get some numbing stuff from the GP to put on 1/2-3/4 hour before.  And also to reasure you, unless you have it reeeeely bad, you will be tried out with tablets and change of diet before you go onto insulin and even then they are so thin you will not feel them.  This from a needle phobic!!!!  My first words after diagnosis were not polite!|`|aRkYiXtGaa	with diabetes, you are constantly thirsty, pee alot, feel sick and dizzy if you are late eating, weight loss although this is the one symptom i did not have....sigh, if you are worried then go to your docs|`|AA10671705	Diabetes is on the rise.  Young people may get type 1 or 2.  Type 1 is when your body does not produce insulin, and type 2 your body produces but doesn't use the insulin.  Depending on how severe, you can have some but not all symptoms of diabetes.  Go to the doctor for a simple blood test to find out for sure.<br>  In the mean time, cut out all sugar!  1 can of Coke has 44 grams of sugar.  That's 11 teaspoons!  Cut out or down on candy, breads, pastas, and other starchy foods.  If you do, your symptoms may go away.  Also, exercise is great for burning carbs and sugar.|`|AjU48L5Xaa	You don't need all of the symptoms to have diabetes.

It is not because of sex, that we consciously bring children into this world. It is to give our own life meaning, and more selfishly, (even though it's not always a conscious thought process), we want to be immortalized. With our DNA living on, we for all intense and purposes, will not fade into obscurity. Children give us hope. Hope is the philosophical reason not to commit suicide. Hope is not science, nor can it be forced, captured, or artificially reproduced, therefore, it relies on the philosophy of the soul, another intangible that you can't see or touch.<br>  To love is to live, to hope is to live well. Death is the end of all hope. To commit suicide is to admit that you were a failure, and gave up just when you could have been getting everything that you wanted to have or achieve. Lost with all hope gone forever, just like the suicidal soul; nothing remains to look forward to, and nothing remains behind to hope for.

iMY2fgYdaa	well let me start by warning you that making a 2+ mile walk may not be as easy as it sounds right away. I would say you might want to work your way up to the whole trip, start with small walks not on play days so if you can't make the whole trip you won't feel like you missed a fun time with other mommies. but once your walking that much you should see some results add to that a balanced diet with lots of fruit and veggies and lean protein and you should be on your way to weight loss. Stretch marks will get better over time, they may never totally go away but they should fade with time. I too am starting an excercise routine. My son is 14mos and I have put on weight since I stopped breast feeding him 11 mos ago. I could kick myself! =0) Good luck..keep up a good attitude...progress won't happen over night..but you can do it !!!|`|kVIOtS5gaa	I am currently 9 months pregnant and go for 2 mile walks. It is a great form of light excercise. Your walks may be a great way to start. Do you have a bicycle? Maybe you can start by riding for 30 min a day and gradually go up. Running is another good way after you build up your tolerance!
p10niY6Faa	Balanced diet, portion control  and exercise period, no other way.|`|72XjqU52aa	You should cut down on sweets and fatty foods. It's hard but it helps. Eat breakfast. Fruit, cereal or yogurt is what I recommend. There are different types of food out there that help speed up your metabolism that you can look up on google, or another search drive. some include apples, broccoli, grapefruit and plain yogurt.<br>  <br>  A normal exercise routine is a good way to go. At least 20-30 minutes a day, because it gets your body warm and burning fat and building muscle. If you have IO free on demand you might wanna check out lifeskool's workout stuff. Laughing for at least 15 minutes a day is also supposed to help you lose weight and stuff I've heard. lol<br>  <br>  Also, sleep is important. Get lots of sleep. That's supposed to help you loose weight too.

8766d5d58d5c55bfc377484572718c2faa	Hey Sentinel. I applaud your effort to get back into shape. That is the first step into losing those pounds we all know we have somewhere in our body.<br>  <br>  Many people will tell you countless methods on how to "quickly lose weight" such as a tea from South America that came from the Frigid mountains and will for sure cut pounds. Or just turn the tv, I guarantee you somewhere they are going to show off those "Nutri-System" programs or that Bowflex home gym or whatever. The weight management business hit an ALL TIME low in some weird offer in which you buy a bunch of tapes and if you listen to them while you sleep, you lose the weight....<br>  <br>  Does any of these things really sound reasonable? Come one, Sentinel your a smart guy. Don't waste your valuable money on crap that pills or "teas" that might only endanger your health. You want the million dollar answer to losing weight...... *drum roll*<br>  <br>  Losing weight is not temporary, its a lifestyle. That is quite possibly the most natural and effective way you can do it. Its all about how you live your life. Sure everyone likes to have that beer or two on the weekends to chill and stuff, not to mention that cigarette you've been dying to have the whole week, OOH and what about that cheese burger at the local burger joint.<br>  <br>  See where I am getting at.... Its the choices in life that really make us gain weight not just those one time I - ate - too -much events. So what I suggest you do is to make a plan and stick to it. If you want I can give you a sample one but you don't have to follow mine. Design something thats right for you and enjoy life. Don't stress too much about losing weight. Remember, starting mild and progressing your way towards a more rigorous lifestyle will really make the difference. ( Note: When I say rigorous, I mean living without those bad junk foods we all know we love and seriously limiting them and FOLLOWING YOUR PLAN!!!) Ok, so here it is ... my sample weight loss plan.<br>  <br>   Step 1) Take time to think through all of the foods that you eat and how you can improve on them. For example, if you have a bag of cheetos, Pepsi lying around in the pantry, and donut holes stashed in the living room, make note of that in  your journal. And be sure NOT to stock up on those items as much. Next time you go to the grocery store, be sure to buy lots of healthy foods * or at least some, especially if the words "fruits and vegetables are like a foreign language" Have you heard of Organic foods, this is a step ahead of the actual one but its a much better investment on your health * I won't pester you too much on it though*<br>  <br>  Step 2) Excercise, Excercise, Excercise. There is practically no getting around it. I know it sounds corny and over used but its the truth. Trust me, I was once considered a couch potatoe and a lazy butt so I know how it feels. Try, if possible, joining a local gym membership like LA Fitness or something. If that is too much, just try spending at least half an hour working out a variety of excercises. If you jam to some good and upbeat music, WOW! you can really feel the burn and you have fun doing it Just remember to do the usual : crunches, push ups, jumping jacks, etc etc. Be sure to warm up before any excercise!!<br>  <br>  Step 3) Reward yourself for keeping up the good work. If you don't follow the above steps first, don't count this step in please! This is a long process that takes time--remember the old saying "good things take time". If you did the required work, then having a day out with family or friends at a local eatery or ice cream shop would be good. You don't have to be a fitness trainer to be physically fit, just cautious on what you eat and goes down your body.<br>  <br>  WOW! I think I wrote too much... hehe. I really do hope my advice helps, if at all, in some way or another. Sentinel, you can do it! Just believe in yourself and inspire others around you, if they aren't already, to start being active citizens of the world.|`|q0ce9dEnaa	Yes you can do both at the same time, but fat will not turn into muscle. Try to jog/walk for cardio, and getting a membership to a gym or possibly a Bowflex. Good luck!
f8mLpPXlaa	Yes. just as long as you're not diagnosed with it. You've probably got what's called cold air induced asthma but since it goes away so quickly I can't even say that with certainty.
f8mLpPXlaa	Asthma is diagnosed through a history of shortness of breath that doesn't go away. That is an indication for your doctor to do spirometry tests. That's just breathing into a tube. You don't really sound like you have a problem with asthma. Don't know why the doc gave you an inhaler. Probably had too many of them in his office and was giving them to everyone.|`|8SW6RUMtaa	Your Doctor Will Have To Give You A Breathing Test or Send You Out To A Specialist Who Gives You A Breathing Test And Then You Will Find Out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, And Get Better.

d8iPx2G0aa	Everyone is going to react a little differently depending on your immune syatem and to how severe your warts are. For me, when my doctor used TCA within two days the two were visibly smaller. A week later the smaller one was gone.Within three weeks the I didnt have a trace that they were even there. No scarring, nothing. I responded to the treatment well. Hopefully you will only have to do this once. From your description your situation was similar to mine.

YLuHUgBbaa	If you are drinking 2 litres of water a day then I'm not surprised you're peeing a lot more.

jkX4gHAiaa	Sounds like it might be infected.   Are you cleaning it properly every day?   Are you using good quality earrings?  You might want to either let it grow shut, or go see a doctor to see if the piercing can be saved.   <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|hah4QjZKaa	Most likely. Put some antiseptic on it. You may also want to call the place that did the piercing and get their recommendations.|`|u8Ts3Nxbaa	Be sure that the piercing is infected, and you are not actually allergic to the jewelry. Visit your piercer immediately; they should be able to tell what is wrong, and to swap out the jewelry if you are allergic. If it is infected, they should send you to a doctor. <br>  Some irritation is normal for piercings. Irritation will make your piercing red, swollen, sore, and it will lymph (have "crusties" and seep) longer and more than normal. Infection will make it red around the piercing and relatively large area of surrounding tissue, sore at the site and inches away, and it will seep dark yellow to green pus. <br>  <br>  An infection is also usually warm to the touch. Either way, if you have any concerns about your piercing, visit your piercer immediately. <br>  <br>  Determine possible causes of the infection. What did you use to clean the piercing? Did you wash your hands? How often are you cleaning your piercing? Make whatever changes to your aftercare routine are necessary to prevent future infections. <br>  Normal soreness and irritation should respond to salt water compresses. Dissolve 1/8 tsp. non-iodized salt in a cup of warm water, and either dip your piercing into the cup or use a clean cotton ball to hold it gently against the piercing. Do this for 5-10 minutes once or twice a day. If your piercing is still red and sore, see your piercer or a physician immediately. <br>  <br>  If you think you might have an infection, get your piercing checked out by your piercer and/or a physician. Many infections require treatment with antibiotics. Remember that the longer you have the infection, the harder it will be to treat.<br>  <br>  Different infection locations are harder to treat. Cartilage receives less blood flow than regular flesh, so it is important to get possible cartilage infections checked out as quickly as possible

It is likely you will undergo a hernia exam (turn your head and cough while he checks the perineum).  At age 21, it is unlikely you will have a prostate exam, so no rectal.

kGsRFXRhaa	Diet pills are a waste of money and time. They all can have side effects, if not serious side effects and most are extremely unhealthy. Alli of course is the newest craze in the diet pill world. However, many people have report problems with inability to control bowels since 20% of the fat that you eat is passing right through you. I know quick fixes may seem tempting, especially if you are pressed for time, but in the long run the weight is not going to stay off, and you are going to be out 50 bucks. Exercising and making healthy food choices such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean meats are the only tried and true method to lose weight and keep it off. <br>  <br>  I will make one SMALL amendment to my NO PILLS rule. Caffeine pills, when used in moderation can be helpful and they are usually pretty cheap. Taken about 20 minutes before exercise, they can help the body to use triglycerides as energy, theoretically burning more fat. I think that the actual physiology behind it is more linked to the fact that you will be able to work out longer and harder. But either way you are burning more calories and fat. One NoDoze pill contains the same amount of caffeine as one cup of coffee. I would start by cutting the pill in half and over several days moving to taking a whole pill, especially if you have a sensitivity to caffeine. Also, if you have a heart condition this may not be the best thing! Other than that, you will notice a increase in energy level right away and that your endurance is better,which can be pretty motivating during your workout :) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YWQdsoOMaa	CLA-500, Slimmetry, and carb blockers.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	No, and you want the truth? Taking diet pills without a doctor's supervision can seriously injur your organs and leave you permanently damaged. I went through a bonefide "dieting center" and ended up taking 30 pills a day. My kidneys were almost shot by the time I saw a doctor.<br>  <br>  If you're on a budget, start eating better, keep a food journal and exercise. THAT will help you lose 20 pounds easily by swimsuit season AND tone up.|`|zeZtFbGjaa	Im a former bulimic (ya i know) but im recovered now and very healthy<br>  <br>  Here's sum simple tips besides the obvious of pills, exercises and eating healthy<br>  <br>  I used to eat from paper plates/napkins to absorbs any extra oils or fats<br>  <br>  take a multivitamin, to make sure you ain't missing out on Essential nutrients<br>  <br>  eat plenty of chili as it increases your metabolism<br>  <br>  Give yourself treats as rewards eg a facial<br>  <br>  water before meals to fill you<br>  <br>  drink iced water as ur body uses Cal's to warm it up<br>  <br>  eating celery burns more cals, dan whats in d actual celery stick<br>  <br>  Eat small portions regulary<br>  <br>  Eat from a small plate, wit a small spoon, and put in down between mouthfuls, and not in front of the tv, tricks your mind you've eaten loads<br>  <br>  Good Luck and remember be healthy!|`|uQZQTAAlaa	Nope. Like it said once on Good Morning America Show, no diet pills really work. I'm sorri, I really wished there were magic pills out there that did take out all the fat, but there isn't. However, there are surgeries for fat, but since your on a budget I don't know...there really expensive.|`|XKhNw221aa	none that are safe and cheap. but most work off a placebo effect anyway, so they don't actually work, people just think they do.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	No, so if your on a budget you are just wasting money if you buy them|`|mlaLgoaSaa	When I started my fitness regime, I used Hydroxycut to give me a little jumpstart. It did help a little, but I eventually stopped using it because of it's high caffeine content. Hydroxycut gives ou energy because of the caffeine, and also works by supressing your appetite. So, if you take it shortly before eating, you won't want to eat as much. If you do try Hydroxycut, I would recommend you try the caffeine free version. It still has the appetite supression benefits, but it doesn't have any of the caffeine. Here are some general guidelines to get you started:<br>  <br>  1. Change your diet. Try and obtain most of your calories from complex carbohydrates (this will give you energy and keep you feeling full). Remember, you lose fat by burning more calories each day than you consume. Example: If you burn 2000 calories each day just by existing, and burn 300 more through exercise, eat less that 2300 calories. Never skip breakfast. Snacks are fine as long as they are healthy. Examples: fresh fruit and veggies, rice crisps, peanuts, yogurt, etc...) Also, little things will help tons! Like, switch to skim milk, eat low fat yogurt, use cooking spray instead of oils, opt for the low fat foods, eat whole grain bread... All these things will help a lot. <br>  <br>  2. Drink AT LEAST 8 (8oz) glasses of water each day. The more water you drink the better. Especially if you are working out.<br>  <br>  3. Try and do 20-40 minutes of continuous cardio exercise (jogging, speed walking, elliptical, biking) every day, at least 3 times per week (the more days you can do this, the better).<br>  <br>  4. Create a weight training schedule. Try to do some general strength training exercises at least 3 times per week. Remember, muscle burns fat. So, the more lean muscle tissue that is on your body, the faster you will burn fat.<br>  <br>  5. Stretch! This will help to lengthen and tone your muscles. Some studies even show that it can help to prevent injury. It also feels awesome!<br>  <br>  It sometimes takes about 8-12 weeks after starting a weight loss regime to see results (depending on the intensity of your fitness plan). So be patient, and keep with it! It will pay off.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck!|`|2xMtNeWiaa	your best bet is en ECA stack and exercise. <br>  <br>  i remember last summer i went from 190 to 155 in 2 months.  ECA stack is ephedrine, caffeine and asprine. its kinda like an energy pill so you can get kind of an extra boost while working out. ephedrine helps burn fat too. and if you gain muscle, your fat wil burn even faster. and i ate about 7 semi-small meals a day. and i only ate chicken. and i also was taking in about 600grams of protein every other day. <br>  <br>  budget wise.. the pills will run around $50 for about 60days worth. working out wont cost a thing, cuz u can just do pushups, situps and jogging for free. if you are planning on taking protein, you can find good deals. check BIOTEST's GROW protein. <br>  <br>  but you can even lose all the weight without the pills. ive been doing stuff legit. i started at 165 and in 5 days im down to 155. all i did was eat 3 times a day rather than my original 2. i eat breakfast, small lunch, then an early dinner and workout every other day. but again.. the ECA stack is for the "extra boost."<br>  <br>  you can google "thermogenesis." thats the name of the pill that works well. also HOTROX. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|UqYdAn9Kaa	Alli, the catch is that it trains you forcibly to increase better eating habits.

lEX3CjWlaa	I'm not sure whether you mean colonoscopy or endoscopy. Usually to look into the stomach the procedure is called an endoscopy. An endoscope is inserted through your mouth and down your throat into your stomach. A colonoscopy inserts the scope through your rectum and into the large intestine.<br>  <br>  I've had both. Neither one is painful. You're given anesthesia and therefore you don't feel a thing. My doctor's policy is that you need someone to drive you home and you should take it easy for the day. I usually sleep for an hour or two afterwords and then relax, read, watch the tube, etc. With the endoscopy I didn't feel any sore throat.<br>  <br>  The worst part about a colonoscopy is having to fast the day before and having to take a lot of laxatives to get rid of your stool. For the endoscopy it was just fasting for a day (if I remember correctly).<br>  <br>  At any rate, nowadays it's no big deal, no real pain, just some hunger and sitting on the toilet!<br>  <br>  Good luck and Hope this Helps|`|mhvb9eFkaa	No sore throat, no pain in chest!  It's a colonoscopy, they go in from the other end...<br>  The biggest discomfort is the couple of days before while you are preparing.  If they haven't told you about that, I will leave it to them.<br>  No big deal...Hope everything is ok!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|9d4dde8ee93c61556ce6bc47c566e365aa	My boyfriend has a colonoscopy every 6 months as he is a colon cancer survivor.  They either put you completely out or they put you in something that is called "conscious sedation".  You're awake, you can answer basic questions, but you really won't have any recollection of what happens during the procedure.   My boyfriend just had one about a month and a half ago.  He says he does remember my calling to talk to him after the procedure, but he can't remember the conversation, nor can he remember anything that the doctors told him after the procedure.  You have to have someone take you to & from the colonoscopy.  They won't let you drive home on your own.  <br>  <br>  They fill you full of air so the scope can maneuver around the colon easier. So you will be somewhat gassy after the procedure.  If you have polyps in your colon, they will remove those, so you may feel a bit of pain after, as well as a little bit of blood in your stool  during the first few  bathrooms experiences.  The polyps are tested to see if there are any abnormalities or if it's cancerous.  <br>  <br>  You typically can't eat for one whole day prior to the procedure and you have to cleanse your colon with either a phospho-soda mixture or something called "colyte".  The doctors will let you know which one to use.  <br>  <br>  In a nutshell, you'll be pretty out of it during and for a few hours after the colonoscopy, you may have some discomfort  depending on if they removed any polyps and/or if it was difficult to maneuver around the colon, & maybe some spotting or light bleeding in your stool the first few bathroom experiences.  You can eat after...but stick to light soft foods and kinda ease yourself  back into your normal eating patter.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...good luck with the procedure.|`|0XcmGUjMaa	Colonoscopy, it is't for your stomach and ulcers. It'a a diagnose act wich refers in principle at the study of BOWELS (COLONoscopy).<br>  <br>  It is uncomfortable if the doctor do their work with no pacience and sure hand. But you have a great doctor go him without fear and TRUST him that he do the better work.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|GawVIf3paa	Seriously, you wont feel a thing either for endoscopy or colonoscopy.

If your stool is red, and you didn't just drink a bottle of red dye or eat a peck of beets, then you need to go to you doctor.  Or urgent care or ER.  Now.

AA11476749	Exhibit some self control.|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	Well before doing something like this you need to know that its not a nasty habit as much as a very required habit.   Sperm go bad.  They spoil like sour milk in the fridge.   <br>  <br>  Sperm are produced in an environment that is temperature sensitive.  Too warm and its not right.  Too cool and its not right.  Ever notice the balls moving about.  They are trying to keep within the right temperature range.<br>  <br>  A sperm cell represents only part of you.  the other part is that of the female.  50% with 50% to make a new person.  However, there is a price to pay for this design.  Because the DNA represents only half of you your bodies defenses will go after and kill them in an instant.  You body kills infection by detecting its is not made up aof a complete blueprint in this same way.<br>  <br>  To save the sperm the body introduces a helper cell.  A cell that tricks the body into believing that the sperm is all there, and thus allowing the immune system to not kill them off.  The only problem here is that the helper cell has a short life, and once its gone the sperm is vulnerable to attack by the same system that would attack a cold or bacterial infection.<br>  <br>  As you body attacks more and more of them it starts to anticipate their presence and prepares antibodies to kill them.  This can reduce a males sperm count big time by the time he is an adult.  You are in your prime and if you don't dump the guys they remain there with no way to protect themselves, and in  dying the cause the immune to be on alert for them.<br>  <br>  A girl has a period because she is flushing out the old egg to make way for a new one.  You have a period too.  But in your case its every day.  Not only is it fun but its required.  To prove this you need only consider how odd the task is and that you know how.<br>  <br>  You know how because your body is making you do what needs to be done.  You can never and will never quit.   More important is that you are causing very bad things to happen in doing so.  Also its basically sex.  You are having sex.  The body cannot tell the difference.  Its practice for what one day you will be required to perform.  If you don't like it then you will not like sex either since its the very same process.  <br>  <br>  Guys that are great in bed with their women are the best at masturbation.  Also its not just for males.  Females also benefit greatly from it.  But for males its not a question of doing it or not.  It more a question of how much we do it, and that can be controlled a bit.<br>  <br>  As an adult you will do it less.  As a kid you will do it as many as 20 in one day, but closer to 7 or 8 at your p-eak.  If your peak is less then as an adult you may end up with once a week or even a month.  So its best to keep high demands on this system.  The more you do the more you make and the more you end up doing.<br>  <br>  Its like a mothers milk for her kid.  A mom will stop producing milk when the demand on her from her kid stops.  It the kid does not stop feeding the mom will continue producing it until that time.  In other words if you still did it by age ten then it would still be there that long.  No kidding !<br>  <br>  Less demand from you at your age has very negative aspects later as an adult.  You body wants you to get with the program.  Its that vital to you.  It means your sperm will always be fresh and ready to go.  Like changing the oil in your car.  Don't do this and see what happens. <br>  <br>  Oh.. And don't worry...  You can try to stop but it will not work.  Frustrating hu ? Trying to quit will cause just that. <br>  <br>                                ( Frustration )<br>  <br>  Your True and Most Complete Answer.  I hope you think so.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	work out a lot so ur hands are all caliced, so it would hurt to play with urself.|`|B667elmWaa	You can get patches to stick on your arm from the pharmacy.

87756LlTaa	You are absolutely right.  It is most likely a lymph node fighting your illness.  If it does not go away in a couple of weeks, then have it checked.  Swollen nodes can also indicate a form of cancer, but it if it popped up during your illness, then the chances of that are really, really, really small.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|tqhr4V33aa	check your Deodorant if it has aluminum in it stop using it..

You should still keep an eye out for high fever, or swelling in less common areas, though.
qrGLcTh4aa	That quote is accurate. I have worked for a periodontic office for 7 years now, we place the implant for 2,000 and the patient goes back to the general dds for the crown which usually runs between 500 to 800 dollars depending on which tooth it is. It's standard.<br>  But if it helps you any, it is a one time expense. Unlike bridges,  that implant will never need to be replaced.  He is young and it is the very best option for him.|`|z9st8cLvaa	I had a tooth implant and a crown put in less than a year ago, and the quote you were given looks about right.  Since this is surgery (I was actually knocked out- not sure if your son will be too), I'd be careful getting it done "cheaper."  You don't want to risk something going wrong just to save a couple hundred bucks.  Also, as I'm sure you know, the success of these implants is only about 85%, so you want to be sure you go with someone who is experienced and had a solid reputation for doing implants, otherwise it could fail and you'll end up shelling out more money in the long run.
ztrRs62Daa	Not a huge fan of her, but I'll admit she's a nice size! <br>  <br>  Depending on what height you are, 90 pounds does sound quite underweight. I would suggest eating quite a healthy diet but don't be afraid to eat treats when you want to! I'd say you should exercise by playing sports or doing exercise you think is fun as opposed to just exercising because you think it's good for you.<br>  <br>  Miley's quite toned but also quite slim. Her legs are quite sturdy looking, so if you wanted legs like that then you should build up a -bit- of muscle on them, by cycling or running, for example..<br>  <br>  I reckon you should put on a bit of weight. In fact, you'll probably look better for it!

y4SUDnpaaa	I don't even understand your question. You say control their thoughts if they think other people can hear them.............wouldn't they have to keep their mind completely blank? Can you control your thoughts to the point you have none. I know Buddhist  Monks can do it after years of training but not 24/7. I think it's impossible for the average person. I have OCD and without meds I have constant unwanted thoughts, if I could blank my mind, without being put in a medical  coma ,  I would certainly do it.........but I think I would be a pretty boring person and virtually have no life. I don't mean to be so rough with you there are just so many people who thinks anyone with a mental or emotional problem could just stop if they only tried....that is so not true.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	They cant.

3QIWdvG1aa	The most common symptoms among teens and young adults are:<br>  <br>      * A stiff and painful neck, especially when you try to touch your chin to your chest.<br>      * Fever.<br>      * Headache.<br>      * Vomiting.<br>      * Trouble staying awake.<br>      * Seizures.<br>  <br>  Children, older adults, and people with other medical problems may have different symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Babies may be cranky and refuse to eat. They may have a rash. They may cry when held.<br>      * Young children may act like they have the flu. They may cough or have trouble breathing.<br>      * Older adults and people with other medical problems may have only a slight headache and fever.<br>  <br>  It is very important to see a doctor right away if you or your child has these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell whether they are caused by viral or bacterial meningitis. And bacterial meningitis can be deadly if not treated right away.<br>  Treatment depends on the cause. See your doctor right away if you or your child has symptoms, because bacterial meningitis can be deadly if not treated right away.<br>  <br>  Bacterial meningitis is treated in a hospital. You or your child will get antibiotics. And you will be watched carefully to prevent serious problems such as hearing loss, seizures, or brain damage.<br>  <br>  But viral meningitis is more common, and most people with this form of the illness get better in about 2 weeks. With mild cases, you may only need home treatment. Home treatment includes drinking lots of fluids and taking medicine for fever and pain.<br>  Can meningitis be prevented?<br>  <br>  The best way to protect your child from meningitis is to make sure he or she gets all the standard immunizations for children. These include shots for measles, chickenpox, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) disease, and pneumococcal infection.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor about whether you or your child also needs the meningococcal vaccine, which is a shot to prevent bacterial meningitis. It is recommended for:<br>  <br>      * Adolescents ages 11 and 12.<br>      * Teens ages 13 to 18 who haven't had the shot yet. (They should get it as soon as possible.)<br>      * College freshman living in dormitories.<br>      * People who plan to travel to countries known to have meningitis outbreaks.<br>      * People without a spleen.<br>      * People with HIV.|`|Q8fcepcZaa	i dont think you have meningitis. if its been 2 weeks of neck pain i wouldn''t worry.|`|JBugDqvraa	meningitis is normally quick to take affect, like hours of getting a headache you'll get a rash and feel really ill. <br>  I think you're lack of sleep may account for many of your problems. It is soo important to get enough sleep or you'll feel really tired and prone to infections colds etc more easily and your concentration will suffer.|`|Yukmn4dHaa	It sounds to me like your just stressing yourself out.

uVMlNvLoaa	This is a very, very incorrect method of taking birth control. You need to have the hormone in your body 24/7 to prevent the release of an egg, and you CANNOT borrow someone else's pills for just a day. You also need to have a gynecological exam before you start taking to pills to ensure that you do not have any conditions that would be aggravated by sex or the pill, and to make sure that you do not have abnormal cervical cells from having sex and transmitting the Human Papilloma Virus.<br>  <br>  Planned Parenthood, get there. Free BC and condoms.|`|hswTS1jVaa	No, you have to take it every days, as directed.  Go to planned parenthood and get some.|`|0ujpiBTCaa	Oh lord. When the dr gives you the pills they are supposed to tell you how it works.<br>   NO IT WILL NOT WORK AT ALL if you just take it some days. It needs to ber every day at the EXACT same time.<br>  Why not use condoms? Or not have sex. You sound very young.<br>  <br>  Have you talked to her parents about this? It would be much cheaper to buy pills with their consent, as you will need their consent to put them on their insurance. If you can't get their permission you will have to pay out of  pocket. Try a clinic.<br>  <br>  Also please remember for full effectiveness you need to wait at least a full month of perfect usage.|`|AA11988490	A. The female needs to take birth control (I assume you are talking about the pill??) every day for at least 1 month to be covered 99% by the pill. You do not take it only on the days you are going to have sex. <br>  You didn't say how old you are, so I cannot tell you where to go to get BC. Planned Parenthood can help you out with the pill, but if you just want condoms, then get them at the pharmacy. <br>  If I were you guys, I would let her know its probably not a good idea to keep this from her parents, or your's for that matter. You might be surprised how understanding they are, especially if you are responsible enough to talk to them about it. Unless you are like 13 or 14, then i would say WAIT!!!<br>  Remember-you don't want a baby just yet so re-think having sex!!|`|GGjjtHmHaa	it doesnt work that way, you have to take it for like 3 months REGULARLY you might as well just use the condom. and if you go to one of those free clinics, then they can give you bc for free i think. depending on where you go, you can also get an implant in her arm that last for 5 yrs without taking any pills to go with it, but i think you have to have parent consent. im not sure, just tell her parents that you want birth control i mean, it's either that or risk getting her knocked up and i really think they'd be more pissed about that :P|`|MeeJWmGtaa	It doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  But you can get condoms at every pharmacy or even at the grocery store. Also, I think her parents would be much happier knowing she IS using birth control, rather than relying on the old "I'll pull out in time, baby, I promise!"|`|H86wyEfmaa	without her parents knowing, have her go to planned parenthood. and no she has to take it everyday|`|22e2ae64861e33c2bed37fba9b020509aa	No you have to take it as directed(which is EVERYDAY except the week during the period--depending on birth control!!!)  Birth control can take up to a month to take effect so you should wear a condom until then!  <br>  <br>  If you have a planned parenthood or family planning near you go there! They allow you to get free birth control and services since she does not want her parents to know and therefore would not have insurance, and also they will not contact her house.

3qojMwpHaa	Start simple. First, choose a time that you want to work out. Morning, afternoon, or evening. Once you have chosen the time when you want to work out, start you cardio work out by warming up. This can be done by touching your toes, jogging in place for 30 sec. (without slowing down), touching the back of your neck with each hand and holding it there for 10 sec., and rotating your arms. Once you have completed this, go ahead a do 3 sets of 50 jumping jacks (this is what I do). After you do one set, go ahead and do knee raisers while standing up (research the picture and movement if you need to). Do 3 sets of these for 1 1/2 mins. (You will def. feel the burn if you do this correctly). Add this exercise to your jumping jacks exercise to make a superset. (1 set of 50 jumping jacks, then 1 set of knee raisers for 1 1/2 mins, etc.) <br>  This is just a suggestion. Other cardio work outs include jumping rope, BRISK walking, running, jogging, riding a bicycle, swimming, or maybe even playing a sport (basketball, baseball, volleyball, tennis, etc.).<br>  <br>  Take this from me: Cardio is ANY exercise that gets your heart moving (pumping blood at a fast rate). You will start feeling like you are really working your body when you do cardio. <br>  <br>  Good luck my friend.<br>  <br>  P.S. - I just want to say that two people commented on this and stated that doing crunches or sit-ups is cardio. Those are NOT cardio exercises. Those are resistance training exercises (the exercises "train" your abs, therefore one can get a nice set of abs, etc.) However, the comments that state that interval training exercises (cardio) and running are cardio exercises are correct.|`|86b5dc2d162d080ceda7f37e239d98d0aa	Run, Run, Run. you will not only lose weight, you will get toned as well, also there is another excercise you can do it's the wall sit, put your back against the wall squat as long as you can repeat, this will give u a tight plump booty! add some 5lb free weights in there, and i'm sure you will have a rockin bod by spring break!|`|1EnVZzkEaa	bicycle crunches<br>  tibetan rites|`|8SRjELNBaa	high intensity interval training|`|n4uffXEtaa	curl ups and crunches.

I had an acid problem something horrible a couple of nights ago and two big tablespoons of honey helped a lot.  Also, for liquids, drink water with lemon in it.  Plain water is hard on your stomach.

I don't know you and I'm not telling you to start smoking, but marijuana is safer than drinking and it really wouldn't really be a big deal if you did it all the time.

Interestingly, allergic reactions can also affect the intestines, leading to diarrhea so this could be related to the original allergic reaction.  On the other hand, it could simply be a touch of a virus or food poisoning that's come up at the same time as the hives.<br>  <br>  Frustratingly, in most cases of hives, the cause can't been pinpointed so the doctor is stuck having to say that it's an allergic reaction to "something" - "perhaps something in the air".
FEVQisMGaa	Oh my...<br>  <br>  This is a really delicate issue. There are drug induced methods of slowing your metabolism, but I would not recommend them. You must consider how it'll interact with your thyroid medication.<br>  <br>  It takes some degree of physical and mental capablity to control your metabolism. Your best bet is to adapt your diet, which I'm sure you've already done.<br>  <br>  You can radically increase your caloric intake. Grains and starches are an excellent source (rice, white breads, potatoes).<br>  <br>  Replace your fluid intake with juices and shakes. Water has no caloric content, so substitute your beverage consumption with caloric beverages.<br>  <br>  You should also alter HOW you consume your food. Eating a lot of healthy meals in small quantities spaced over a day is a way to increase your metabolic rate. You trick your body into a more active and consistent state of high digestion.<br>  <br>  So you do the opposite. It's okay to eat meals during the day, but mostly, you should be gorging on large quantities of food, and then sleep shortly afterwards. This creates a hibernative effect--like what bears and some mammals trigger prior to the winter.<br>  <br>  Excercise is important. And so is sleep. Basically lounge more often and engage in low impact exercises (non-aerobic). Weight lifting, with breating exercises are acceptable--this is to prevent muscular atrophy.<br>  <br>  You can take birth control pills. Many people take birth control pills for reasons other than pregnancy prevention. Dermatologists prescribe it for severe cases of acne.<br>  <br>  Birth control/hormone pills can induce weight gain.<br>  <br>  The other alternative isn't to slow your metabolism, but to match your physical/excercise lifetyle to it's rate. Engage in more physical activity and make it effective activity. Use the energy to your advantage.|`|yGPRntXFaa	Why do you want to gain weight...?  To be normal...?  You dont need to be normal.. there is no normal...  a girl who is 90 pounds may thinks he needs to loose 5 pounds and so on....   I think if you really want to gain some weight, first write down on a piece of paper what you do all day...  <br>  <br>  for example.. wake up at am,<br>  eat breakfast.....  i had............................and.........<br>  then school, then lunch time, ...............I had.................and ........to eat.<br>  <br>  Also include all the physical activities that you do.... do you work out, cheerlead, run or walk to school...?  swim...?  Etc.<br>  <br>  The key to lowering your metabolism down is to eat before you are going to rest... not before anything exciting like running, playing sports, etc.. you will burn it up anyways...... so eat afterwards... Also, not recommended but I ate pasta a lot and it did  make me gain too much weight............... I had lasagna, spaguetti and meatballs, you name it , I had it.........................................  took some time, but now I am at the other end......... I gained too much weight... I became lazier and get tired often......................  I am turning it around.....<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, if you like stay in touch.. and let me know how you are doing....?  Try this... get a calendar and every Saturday or every monday....... write your weight at waking up time and at sleeping time... once a week only........ too much checking your weight isnt good either..........  and my last advise is go to ANOTHER doctor and see what he or she may think....................

Give it a try, You will get over the smell as soon as you feel how good it relieves the pain.|`|bou4tmBmaa	Yep, just apply aloe vera liberally and frequently to the sun burnt areas, gently patting it into the burn as opposed to massaging it in. It feels cooling to your skin and it is not going to potentially further irritate your skin, as opposed to the body butter stuff you're using now.<br>  <br>  Also drink extra plenty of water, eat foods high in zinc or take a zinc supplement and also get a good amount of sleep to further aid the healing process ...and trust me; especially if the sunburn is not even over your face because you were wearing sunglasses , your really want it to heal the best it can, -> happened to me and for the next 2 YEARS I had a thick white unburned strip across my nose... not the best look -he-he :)|`|c8XTy3Zpaa	Simple answers are best.<br>  <br>  Apply each of these ointments to heal.<br>  <br>  Aloe Vera<br>  Coconut Oil<br>  Moisturiser<br>  <br>  You should also drink alot of water.

5BXmqYrYaa	Stretching before you go to sleep can help relax muscles relieving tension. Also exercise throughout the day and no caffeine 4 hours before sleep. Watch what you eat too. Complex carbohydrates over simple carbohydrates will ensure energy throughout the day and not short bursts. Complex carbs are also good for losing weight vs. simple carbs =) simple carbs = refined sugars, white breads. complex carbs is usually something that's high in fiber like whole grain wheat. I wouldn't recommend the milk like other people say it's pretty high in sugar. Drugs aren't always bad though if that doesn't work as long as used in moderation. Simple stuff like benadryl (diphenhydramine) 25mg will make you just tired enough to doze off.

Now I can sleep at a normal time and wake up in the morning.

XSu3dedGaa	1. Wash the wound well with something including Peroxide to kill the germs or just clean it with a new bottle/can of either a carbonated beverage or bottled water if that is available. But, you would not want to use greases, milk or fruit juices (especially not one with pulp and acids) all of which might cause problems.<br>     2. Use any type of tape you have in the house or car tool kit, etc. It is just temporary.<br>     3. Find some clean material like gauze--or "paper towel" if you do not have any sterile dressing--<br>        Tear or cut a piece of the paper towel to fit the site of the wound. Toilet tissue is not recommended as it is too weak--fragile--and does come all apart and perhaps get into the cut.<br>     4. Cut the paper towel to any shape that is needed--a long rectangle or a small square, etc.<br>     5. Place the gauze or the paper towel over the wound, to stop the bleeding.<br>     6. Use the tape to secure the towel or other bandage that you just made.<br>     7. Make do with a clean cloth--like a long enough strip from an old shirt or bed sheet--which can be used to tie over the paper towel to hold it in place if you have no tape. Do not make it very tight.<br>  <br>  If you can't straighten your hand, you should think about the possibility of a break, and seeing a doctor.|`|98WKYtfwaa	It sounds like you've just staved your thumb. A dressing or bandage won't do anything to help it.
3QIWdvG1aa	Tonsilloliths can be removed by the patient. A medicine dropper (especially one with a curved tip) can help to suck out the stones if they are small enough. Embedded tonsilloliths (which develop inside tonsils) are not easily removed, but will naturally erupt from the tonsils with time.<br>  <br>  The use of pulsating irrigation to clear out the crypts of accumulated debris may also help (using an adjustable unit on a low pressure setting or a needleless monoject syringe to avoid damaging tissue.) Use a solution of salt water to cleanse the tonsil crypts and help prevent future tonsilloliths. The use of a combination nasal/throat irrigation device is recommended. For direct cleansing of the tonsil stones use the throat irrigator tip, and for cleansing of the nasal passages use the nasal irrigation tip. This is especially beneficial for post-nasal drip which routinely contributes to the formation of tonsil stones.<br>  <br>  While difficult to perform due to the gag reflex, a quick brushing with a toothbrush will generally remove surfaced tonsilloliths. Using an oral analgesic like Chloraseptic can help suppress the gag reflex while cleaning the tonsils or crypts. Another effective way to remove tonsil stones is by pressing a finger or Q-tip against the bottom of the tonsil and pushing upward. The pressure squeezes out stones. Some people can even reach them with their tongue, which is the best method as the tongue doesn't stimulate the gag reflex.<br>  <br>  Another remedy for removing them, without stimulating the gag reflex, (in most people) is to simply flex the throat, this causes the tonsils to tense up and will often result in the tonsil stone popping out.<br>  <br>  Surgical treatment<br>  <br>  The most aggressive form of treatment involves surgical removal of the stone, via oral curette or a tonsillectomy to remove the tonsils.<br>  <br>  For large crevices, an effective tool for digging out a stone is an ear curette. The curette is used primarily for the removal of ear wax, but is effective for removal of tonsil stones as well. It comprises a long thin metal stick with a tiny metal loop at the end. Alternatives include the curved end of a crochet needle, a cotton swab, an unfolded paper clip (leaving the smallest bend intact), or a hair grip (bobby pin), although this is not recommended because it is known to cause infection due to the coating of the bobby pin that can flake into the cavity.<br>  <br>  A longer term cure is possible by using laser resurfacing. The procedure is called laser cryptolysis. This technique can be performed under local anesthetic, using a scanned carbon dioxide laser, which vaporizes and removes the surface of the tonsils. In this way, the edges of the crypts and crevices that collect the debris are flattened out, so that they can no longer trap material. Therefore stones, which are almost like pearls forming from a grain of sand, cannot form.<br>  <br>  The most drastic method, a tonsillectomy, is not usually indicated or recommended, but will provide semi-permanent relief. There is still a possibility that the stones will return even with the tonsillectomy.|`|AA10450066	What are tonsil stones and who told you you had them?

3YJe5Z4Faa	Zyrtec (cetirizine) is another non-drowsy antihistamine.

WJzNGhHxaa	Consult a doctor.|`|MhpccWpmaa	You should check with a doctor to be sure that someone didn't take advantage of you the night you were drunk and make sure it's not an STD of some sort.  Other than that, I know that a yeast infection can cause extreme itchiness which leads to A LOT of scratching which then in turn leads to soreness and cutting yourself with your nails (from scratching so much).  It just seems kind of odd that this would happen the day after you were so drunk, but it's possible.
