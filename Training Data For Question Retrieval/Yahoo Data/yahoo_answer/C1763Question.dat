20070108040727AASTzSc	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Isnt this the weirdest thing.?	How when theirs a war. Between Arabs and any ither people lets take the War of Attrition for an example. They have in the casualtys only about 400 men died on the Isaeli side but they put 10,000 injured. With all the sympathy in the world. But for the Egyptian side they put 10,000 soldiers and civilians killed. Why is it that they seem to give so much sympathy to Isreal but not and other arab country.?  Like especially on the news they would say 1,500 Arabs died last week in etc. 'in like two seconds they would be done. But when its Ireals turn they say 10 Isreali soldiers were killed etc. lasting ten minutes.

20090227145318AARe1WP	News & Events;Current Events	Is this what they teach the israeli kids at school?	or that's the way that they've been raised?      to know what I'm talking about, here's a video where some israeli kids -for no reason- started attacking and harassing the palestinian ( females) students that were on their way back from school.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSQXFnv9d...       yes the Palestinian kids do throw stones...at the soldiers! the armed soldiers, the ones that are holding weapons and hiding in their tanks, but what about these kids? I can tell from this video, that the israelis since their childhood, tend to target the civilians(mainly,kids and women).      again, kids targeting a palestinian woman and her toddler     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EUUrE8Lm...       and here's another video where some israeli kids are throwing stones at a woman that is holding a camera    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaiUE-wkE...  ( u have to hear what the israeli soldier was telling her !)    how ironic ,the kids have learned from the israeli soldiers to hate the camera, to target everyone that holds a camera, in case u don't know many journalists have been killed by the israeli soldiers.      so I really want to know, is this something that their parents/ teachers tell them to do, or they naturally tend to be so violent?      (and ofcourse, I won't be surprised if i got reported, since I know that many people over here are from the -oh let's shoot those who tell the truth- kind of personalities. )

20090309093100AAHlSqI	News & Events;Current Events	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Closes Down Bodies Revealed Exhibition?	Would you ever go to this exhibition?    link:  http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,251...    I'm not impressed by this. Yes I understand it is art but personally I think it degrades a person. I understand it's their own choice and they are entitled to that but I'd prefer if it wasn't an option. It is similar work to Dr Gunther von Hagens, who I also don't personally agree with his work.   I've read comments that link this to the corpse of ancient egyptians and other societies, but it was under different circumstances.   They mummified their dead because they believed it was the path to the afterlife. It was the religious practice at the time, like every culture we bury the dead in our different ways.   Plus a majority of these people did great things that have helped with the advancement of todays society. While I'm not saying these people who have given their bodies to science that they didn't achieve anything but its just not the same magnitude.   When people visit the exhibitions of people of the ancient world they don't go to see a 3000 year old corpse they go to see a prolific figure of the ancient world, someone (who in most cases) wasn't even 40 when they achieved something big.      So there is my opinion and I'm not forcing you to agree with me, but I'd like to know what you think. And can I ask that people not attack me for expressing my own opinion.

Octopublicist quits   She recently gave birth to eight kids, so maybe she'll end up having an equal number of PR flacks. Victor Munoz, the latest rep for octuplets mom Nadya Suleman, has told Usmagazine.com that he's resigned. And while no one's exactly accused Suleman of good judgment lately, she can probably do better than a publicist who offers up these choice quotes along with news of his resignation: "It's pretty much a free-for-all over there right now. They are freaking out ... Nadya got real greedy. This woman is nuts." Munoz is the second publicist to leave the octo-nest; an earlier rep quit after her firm received a slew of hate mail.
