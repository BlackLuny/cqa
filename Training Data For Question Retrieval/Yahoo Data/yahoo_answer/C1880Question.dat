But I'm not that good at coding efficiently, and what I'm wondering is, are there any special tricks and techniques that one could apply in coding an RTS to make it run more efficiently? In particular, how would expert programmers do things such as drawing objects onto the screen, unit pathing, unit AI and autotargeting, player AI, etc? It seems to me that the most intuitive ideas, like going down humungous arrays and updating every element or searching for a specific element, would be too slow and complex, when I think about how many tens of thousands of calculations would be required. Am I simply wrong about that, or are there some secrets that l33t people use to make a computer do that kind of stuff faster?

One to put the games on (how large should it be, my friend bought a 4TB internal drive for it...plz tell me that was a little unnecessary), the other for music and movies...160 gig portable should be more than I need, I do download a lot of movies, but no porn so that saves space lol.      Graphics Card: I've never had to upgrade anything on my computer before because they all had crap motherboards (only PCI ports, not PCI Express) and I thought it would be pointless to upgrade.

20090307075242AAFD9sE	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Networking help/calculation!?	Please help me calcualate the answer!      The real time transaction server (which provides the system used to ensure funds are available at the cash desks), all records are held and accessed centrally in the Southbury office. All branches connect to this main server for any transaction, the current arrangement is likely to be inadequate considering the new customers coming to the building society      Currently the server processes around 100 customers a day, this will double with the opening of the new branches. Each customer requires 5 megabytes (total) of upload and download to ensure payment is available. CBBS currently has an agreement on a private line providing 1Gbyte of bandwidth a day with a download/upload speed of 2mbps – each transaction takes about 20 seconds to complete – CBBS finds this 20 seconds unacceptable and would like the processing time to be no more than 10 seconds. You will need to suggest a new bandwidth allocation and speed allocation for the real time transaction server.       Please show the working out. Thank you so much!

20090307094020AAPtow4	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Whats better,a 50 ft. phone modem cable or a 50 ft. Ethernet cable?	ok,so this is my dilemma. I'll try to explain this as best as I can. So my DSL Gateway 2wire modem is located in my room. I use it to connect it to my xbox 360 and 2 other computers(I use an ethernet cable to connect my xbox to the modem and the 2 computers are connected wirelessly)   .But I don't have a phone jack so I had to run a 50 ft(I measured) modem cable to my mom's room cause its the closest phone jack. I've had this for about 4 months and My internet connection only reaches to 4 bars out of five which is all right(its never reached 5 bars).SO I was bored one day and I decided to move the Modem to my mom's room to see if I would get a better internet connection(not that it was bad).I replaced the long *** 50ft modem cable with a smaller one and noticed right away that my connection was faster than ever and had all 5 bars! But I still needed the modem in my room so I could connect it with my xbox 360 and be able to access xbox live.So I got thinking, should i move the modem back into my room and buy a 50ft modem cable again and have it set up like last time or should I buy a 50 ft Ethernet cable that would run from the modem in my parents room to the xbox in my room.Would my xbox live be slower if i used a 50 ft ethernet cable?I hope this isn't too confusing.      P.S My xbox live was ok back when I had the modem in my room but would it make it slower if I used the 50ft ethernet cable instead?Please help.

Hi      The problem I am having is that my start menu keeps changing between the windows classic view and the Windows XP Energy Blue View on its own without me changing it. Sometimes even when I have the energy blue setting selected and I open something such as Internet Explorer or Firefox the appearance of the window changes again on its own. Sometimes it even changes between the two as shown in the pic below. I have run numerous virus checks and adware checks etc as well as changed the appearance manually to get it right but then it changes again. It doesn't seem to do it at certain times i.e when i open something, just does it at random times. and its found nothing. There are no other problems with my computer just this. Have I changed a setting accidentally or does this sound familiar to anyone?      If anyone can tell me how to stop it I would be grateful.

At present it is running with the default driver provided by Windows 2000.  I have downloaded a device-specific driver from the internet and stored it in a folder on C:.  The problem for which I require advice is how to get win2k to use this driver rather than the one at present in use.        I have tried using start/settings/control panel/system/hardware/device manager to change the driver, but the system will not accept the file I try to point it to.   start/settings/control panel/add remove hardware will not allow this either.      The new driver file has a .bin extension.  The file the system wants seems to be a .inf file.  Any helpful comments will be much appreciated.

I have a Windows XP 2000 PC. i had speakers attached to it that worked fine until one day when i cleaned out my hard drive. then all of a sudden the speakers appeared to not work. upon further inspection, the speakers themselves appeared to be working, but i went to the Control Panel and looked under "Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices" and it told me that my computer had no audio devices attached to it, even though the speakers are plugged into the computer. can someone tell me how to "reinstall" my speakers so that my computer recognizes them and they work?

20090307094213AAGd9ij	Computers & Internet;Security	Troubles logging into Windows XP?	I recently restarted my computer and it asked me to log in to a user account.  There is only one user set up on my computer.  I clicked on it and it starts to log in, I see a glimpse of my desktop screen, then it logs me right back out and takes me back to the screen that lists my user name.  I have tried restarting in safe mode, no luck.  My computer didn't come with a restore cd, it is built into my computer, which I can't get into.  I am not a computer genius, however, I have some computer knowledge.  Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.

I want to develop a c compiler for this custom processor. I could use Flex to generate lexical analysis part of the compiler. Now the question:    Can I go ahead and use Yacc to finally come out with a C compiler? Also, am I right when I say that Yacc only generates the three address code which is converted at the optimization stage targeting a given platform?   If yes, what kind of knowledge should I gather before I go on with using Yacc so that I can straight away start writing optimizer and "three address to instruction set converter"?      PS: I am writing this compiler in C.

I want to do the following javascript but still doesn't work.Please help with any functions    Start: When clicked, this button causes animation to begin. When the the page is idle, all frames of the animation are visible. Frames are separated by 5 equals signs in a row and a line break: "=====\n"      When animation starts, whatever text is currently in the text entry box is broken apart to produce frames of animation. (This might be a pre-set animation, or text that the user has typed manually.) During animation, one frame is visible within the text entry box at any given moment, starting with the first frame. The animation changes frames once every 200ms. When the animation reaches the last frame, it loops back around and repeats indefinitely.
20090307095935AAyC6mD	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Overheating computer and playing video games?	i got my new laptop in september of last year and just recently i decided to put all of my games i bought for my old desktop and put it onto my laptop... the main problem was was that i didn't have a lot of space on my laptop so i installed my games on my external hard drive.      now "oblivion" is on my internal and at most my GPU reaches 71 degrees while my two CPU reaches at most 61 according to speed fan. but when i play my "knights of the old republic ii" on my laptop from my external hard drive, my GPU reaches 81 while my CPU reaches 68 degrees.      i was wondering, does playing games on an external hard drive increases the amount of work my laptop has to go through thus heating up? i mean, i think "oblivion" is more demanding.      extra info: i stopped playing "oblivion" in jan and started playing "knights of the old republic ii" in mar.

20090307100855AAqHDy7	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	My graphics card driver and sound card arent working after reformat?	Hey guys, I recently had to reformat due to 5 trojans eating my computer inside out.   After the reformat, I realized that I didn't have sound and couldnt play games that I could in the past. I opened up my device manager and there are Yellow warning exclamation points next to the following devices:   PCI Device   PCI Simple Communications Controller   SM Bus Controller   Video Controller (VGA Compatible)      When I right click on my desktop > Properties > Settings , it SHOULD show the video card that I'm using, but all it says under display is :   (Default Moniter) On  http://i238.photobucket.com/albums/ff66/...    So how can I reactivate my Video Card driver so that it will be picked up by the computer again? If it helps at all, I'm have an Intel processer.      DO NOT give me links to Card upgrading sites. My computer says that I have no card to begin with, when a week ago before the reformat it worked perfectly.      Thank you in advance and I Will choose a best answer.
