20090222223819AAcm9oi	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Difference between stacked washer/dryer and full-size washer/dryer?	Hey everyone! Hopefully you all can provide a little bit of insight.      My Boyfriend and I are thinking of moving in together. I really like his apartment complex and we would like to live in a unit a little bigger than the one he has now. Anyway, he currently has a full size washer and dryer in his apartment but all the other apartments in the complex come with a stacked washer and dryer.       Long story short: He says the stacked washer/dryer would be too small, but I don't think it will be a problem really. Any ideas on which is better and why?       Thanks everyone!

20061209223942AAlKxRx	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Funny sound in my pipes?	There is a funny slushy/scraping sound in our pipes.  It started about a week ago, and it happens every hour or so for about 30 seconds.  Not when anyone flushes or runs water or anything... because it goes on into the middle of the night too.  It sounds kind of like a mouse with a peg leg dragging an avil through the standing water.  Or somebody plungering a slushy full of ice chunks.  We know it's not an animal, because I banged on the wall really hard and it kept going.  It's only in one spot.  Our house is over 100 years old.  So curious...      Happy Holidays!  :)

J'aimerais savoir si je suis la seule dans ce cas : j'ai beau multiplier les achats de stylos à bille,  dès que j'en ai besoin, c'est l'enfer, ils ne marchent jamais. Pourtant, la plupart sont récents, il y a de l'encre dans le réservoir, mais... elle ne descend pas.   Je chauffe très peu la pièce où je travaille, je ne peux donc mettre un humidificateur sur le radiateur, toujours éteint !   Chaque stylo marche pour écrire un ou deux mots, puis... plus rien. Puis ?a remarche (je secoue, je tourne entre mes mains, j'ai même essayé de souffler dans la cartouche : ?a marche pour écrire trois mots suivants, puis... l'encre ne descend de nouveau plus : à devenir cinglée !!!!)   Je crois que je suis condamnée à revenir au stylo à plume, mais... quelqu'un a-t-il une solution ? Qu'est-ce qui fait que l'encre de ces satanés stylos à bille reste dans le réservoir et, apparemment, n'est rapidement plus assez liquide pour couler dans le réservoir ???   MERCI à qui peut me donner une réponse !   Chouka
20090222161325AAjiNaT	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	What do you recommend in the way of weatherstripping for an uneven door on a rented condo?	I'm renting an apartment that has about a 1/2 inch gap on the front door.  Hubby and I currently have a rolled up area rug, blocking air from entering/escaping, shoved into the door jam (this is on the bottom of the door).  We want to weatherstrip it, but we can't take it off of the hinges.  I don't want to drill into the door either since this is a rental.  I should also mention that this door has an uneven gap.  How would you suggest weatherstripping this door?         I don't want to bother the landlord with such a simple project.  He's a nice guy, and lives hundreds of miles away.  I am capable of dealing with this issue.       Thanks for advising me in this tricky situation   ;o)   I appreciate it  :D

20090222162714AATA5UF	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Mold in my bathroom - my problem, or landlord?	I moved into my apartment in September...about a month or so ago my bathroom started growing black mold above the shower and along the sealant in the shower.  My bathroom has no ventilation (no fan/window), to combat this, I shower with the door open so it doesn't get too steamed up in there.      My questions are:   1. Do I need to notify the landlord?   2. Is the landlord responsible to clean it, or me?   3. What is the best way to clean it?   4. I've tried scrubbing the sealant, and it's almost as though it's within the sealant (hope that makes sense)....it's not coming off, so it looks like the sealant needs replaced.  Would this by my job, or the landlord?  If mine, how do I replace it?

Several months age he had a water leak and came round as it was easier to fix it on our side.   He owns a drainage company so we though,t Ok he knows what he is doing so we said 'OK do what you need to do as long as its all made good afterwards'   There was so much water leaking that he broke the main drainage pipe for the water to flow away while he fixed the leak.   He fixed the leak and now we are left with a great big hole outside the house and to top it all there is now human waste stuck in the drain. We have had to cover the hole up with a lard piece of wood because its disgusting.    I have complained to him several times and he keeps saying he is busy but he will get one of his guys to do it next week. Next week never seems to come.   I am now getting worried as the weather starts to get warmer its going to cause a health problem.   Is there anything I can do legally or get the authorities involved.    We are in the UK   Many thanks
