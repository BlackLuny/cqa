The car and the driver are dead at the end.    High School geek Arnie Cunningham falls in love with "Christine", a bright red 1958 Plymouth Fury which has seen much better days. Setting himself the task of restoring the car to its original condition, his friends notice that the car is not the only thing that is changing. Arnie seems to spend more and more time with his car. He's also developed a sort of cocky arrogance which does not seem like the real Arnie at all.|`|BJIo6twUaa	Its the Wraith, seen the movie plenty of times.|`|oIdQaEAUaa	I think it could be Christine
ZyGyDLsDaa	Penny Dreadful (2006)  starring Rachel Miner, Mimi Rogers, Chad Todhunter, Mickey Jones, Liz Davies, Michael Berryman  IMDb review:  A young girl named Penny witnessed her parents dying in a car accident. Years later, she still has a fear of cars and is taken by her psychiatrist to the mountains to confront this fear headon at the place it happened. However, upon reaching their destination, they accidentally hit a grotesque hitchhiker then are left stranded in the middle of nowhere after he attacks the car. With a flat tire, no cellphone reception and a broken ankle, Penny is left to fend for herself against the homicidal maniac. The concept is simple and scary: Imagine being trapped in such a small space and terrorized. People come to help but are brutally slain. Some of the suspense sequences work wonderfully well, from the camouflaging of the killer to noises and sounds in the night.    Here's the movie trailer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UjyP-VA...  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  I've seen this on the Sci Fi Channel a couple of times. It's not her mother but her psychiatrist. The car does get wedged between two trees, with her and the dead woman inside and a killer tormenting her. It gets even freakier.

c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	Once.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	Well, this isn't European, but this weekend I saw a move on HBO called "The Namesake." The story was about a Bengali man and woman who marry in India and come to America. They have two children, and the story centers on their relationship as their kids grow up Americanized, while the mother and father try to maintain a connection to their culture and conservative values.    It's difficult to explain how much wonderful acting and the great story that was squeezed into the two hour length of this picture. One of the stars was Kal Penn (from "House" and the "Harold and Kumar" movies), and he was simply terrific. His mother was played by an Indian actress named Tabu, who was also wonderful. She had this great beauty and dignity that seemed to move her character along through the years.    Worth seeking out.|`|RJZQsBqbaa	Aguirre, The Wrath of God.

The scale is too large. It depends on many many factors.|`|05g5AjKZaa	special effects (SPFX) is an umbrella word that includes: visual effects and special effects.    visual effects is basically CGI - computer generated imagery. Star wars, 300, and Benjamin Button movies incorporate CGI.  Most movies use CGI right now, because of convenience, cost, and overall quality.    Special effects is anything hands-on. This may include prosthetic make-up, animatronics, specialty props, gags-like gun shooting, stabbings, gore, anything that deals with blood, and even character make-up.  Movies like X-Men, Hellboy, Aliens, Predator, and most horror movies use hands on SPFX.      In NY for indie movies...you get **** pay like $100-$300 a day depending on the movie's budget.  For big budget movies you get grands of money depending on the time and cost of materials.    You can either be a special effects artist or a visual effects artist.  Under those two basic types there are a lot specific jobs like prop master or air brusher etc...    Go to Hollywood if you want a job in that industry.  There are some major schools in the west coast.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Check this out for some info  www.essortment.com/all/specialeffects|`|urmhRHwxaa	Depends.  Special effects is a pretty wide field.  Generally, it is separated into physical effects, which are done in-camera and can encompass things like breakaway furniture, wire work, etc., to visual effects, which involve digital compositing, mattes, etc.    I can't honestly say how much they get paid, but I would presume they make very good money since they work in a specialized field.|`|XfzY4fSIaa	special effects supervisor

I went to see them at Wembley Arena. I have videos on YouTube from it.  Patrick is the best. His voice is amazing and he is just plain brilliant.  Pete is overrated now.  Its all about the chubby guy with sideburns and baby eyes now. :D  Then again I don't want to sound like a teenie bopper. Their music is amazing too, it blows me away, especially The Carpal Tunnel of Love, Dance Dance, America's Suitehearts and This Ain't A Scene. :D|`|WfcWglHCaa	i like fallout boy if you like fallout boy you will like avenged sevenfold|`|z5BwZCrXaa	yes...love them they rock...patrick stump is a cutie|`|cgltsvAyaa	H*LL NO!

I hate how Pete gets all the publicity, even when it's not about the band.  I used to really like Pete cuz he writes great lyrics, but ever since he got together with Ashley, that's all people hear about.     "Pete Wentz wears Ashley's size zero jeans"    I'd like to hear  "Fall Out Boy get into the studio again to deliver us more amazing tunes"    Even PRE Ashley, anytime you asked people about FOB , the answer would be like 'What, the band with the hot bassist that spins around a lot?' What about Patrick's amazing vocals, or Andy's awesome drumming....OR JOE'S GUITAR & FRO?    It's not the same anymore. I still love them, but I'm not as crazy about them as before.|`|Y07zLuaKaa	LOVE them.. esp Dance Dance & Thnks fr th mmrs|`|BNcNAMNPaa	Yes! Pete Wentz =D|`|gmrH0sNBaa	Okay I guess... =]    IlovePete!|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	They are semi EMO and in that genre so no not really because EMO is a mix of some twisted form of a Sub Hybrid Gothic culture with Girl Band elements and Girl Pop like B. Spears    Plus the story behind FOB the name anyway is when Pete and the gang created FOB they Fell out of Boy Hood into Girl Hood and as the trade mark they flipped that around and used it as a metaphor.    FALL IN GIRL and we are all now FALL OUT BOYS you get it, GET IT?|`|dBuj1EOKaa	Of course, their best albums are Take This To Your Grave and Folie A Deux.  Their best songs are Grand Theft Autumn / Where Is Your Boy  Chicago Is So Two Years Ago  Of All the Gin Joints in All the World  Golden  Thnks fr th Mmrs  America's Suitehearts  Coffee's for Closers  20 Dollar Nose Bleed|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	yeah they are OK but i wouldnt pay to go see them in concert|`|XuUMXQ8Naa	Yeah I love 'em especially the cute guitarist!!|`|ucQxe2e4aa	No. But, they're from a town about 20 minutes away from my mom's house, and when they used to be "hardcore" or whatever Pete Wentz used beat up my friend in mosh pits.

When George Lucas was casting "Star Wars", he almost gave the part to Glynn Turman, a black actor perhaps best known as the science teacher in "Gremlins", but he was afraid that audiences would be distracted by the racial dynamics.

tLI94qWNaa	The movie was TERRIBLE, a waste of time and I want my time back:D lol  It was not just you, the movie was pointless and plotless.  The first answer is right though, the babies were the reason why she was able to do that, but still, it doesn't explain anything about how the babies got this way, and how she even had the babies inside of her.  They may have a little bit but by that time I am sure I was already lost.|`|S4W7FojCaa	She didn't do that, the twins inside her did. They had some sort of power because they were created in a lab or something like that..|`|FDt7cC8haa	No it was bad, plotless, thoughtless, actionless...

8Xllb2MJaa	It's a Gangsta/G-Funk album, which means it doesn't necessarily have to be lyrical in the same way East Coast albums are.     For me, Gangsta rap is a genre of hip-hop which moves away from the lyricism-driven sound of New York rappers. It's rightfully considered a classic because of the impact it had when it first came out with the unique production it consisted of, and also it's arguably the most influential West-Coast album of all time.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	Classic in terms of production, and I guess because of Snoop's flow on there. Lyrical, no.|`|DDmFQU7raa	Lyrically, no. Nothing new that came from there except Snoop's style of delivery.    The production was on another level, though. The funk mixed in with the hip hop beats not only brought forth a new generation of funk fans, but also drew out the West Coast's laid-back style to people outside of the West Coast.|`|h6AJ87N8aa	EVERYTHING, it was the concept... which included the look, the production, the lyrics, the attitude.  Different movies and music refer to the lyrics all the time,.. the beats are remixed over and over... it was a great thing at the perfect time..|`|gUYcVXMTaa	I would say yes and yes!  I think the Chronic was a very well put together album all around!  And for the time that it came out the lyrics was hot!  And of course the production was off the hook!  There is nothing like Snoop as a teen!  He was a beast back then!|`|mZOt8oURaa	Production but you have to remember it was a coming out party for the new artist.Warren G.,Tha Dogg Pound,Lady of Rage,and Nate Dog!Lyrically no but,that was their resume before hittn the streets.Dre got to show off his production.|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	Production.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	A classic in terms of Production and groundbreaking in terms of style. It introduced the music industry to "G-Funk" which would go on to be the choice style for West Coast rap.|`|w4MvA4Rgaa	A Production Classic.    The Lyrics were good but the Production is why its so great plus it's the album that brought G-Funk on the scene.|`|dOurKVdiaa	Lyrical, Production and Style    What rapper at that time for the next 4 to 5 years wasnt bitting the flow, musical style and the look, not to many.    Dudes was getting nice deals off of just being mention in a song    Remember this line?: "My homie Lil Half Dead" thats what Snoop said in one of his songs,     Then that dude turned around and got a deal.
LcSwDbr4aa	Dewey wants to kill the coralians because he was/is against the plan put in place by Renton's father of saving the coralians in order to keep the peace between humans and coral growth.  Holland treats renton the way he does during episodes 6-27, because He wants to be the one that saves Eureka and hates the fact that it is Renton that has bonded so close to Eureka and changes the way the Niervash interacts with Eureka.  Dewey probably dated Talho since she is good looking and being a man of power probably attracted her to him (before she hooked up with his brother Holland).  As for the last question that I am unsure of.|`|gzxjcVURaa	Dewey wants to kill the coralians because they upset the order of the planet. Humans are supposed to be the dominate lifeform and the coralians have interfered with that. Yeah he's that cynical!!!   Holland is jealous of Renton because Renton can make Eurerka "smile from the bottom of her heart". Dewey thought Talhoa was pretty nuff said.  As for the last question, the anime alluded to Eureka's ability to "merge" with Renton, but the manga is more specific Eureka actually can engage in sexual relations but has yet to "experience it".

Both are well respected actors who came up at about the same time as River.|`|OKzGWQRPaa	I think he'd be a guest star on The Coreys.|`|NdrO7u79aa	Nope. He'd be on a reality show about washed up child stars because he'd have ruined his career with drugs.|`|8UyUhlusaa	I love all the pheonix's. I completley agree. They are such a talented family it's not even funny. I will allways love River Pheonix and his movies and his music! Especially the music (:|`|AA11110732	Maybe. Looking at his last movies, I'd say he was going in the same direction Robert Downey Jr. was... down. It could have gone either way, he could have disappeared into obscurity or turned it around.    The one person I equate with River Phoenix's bizarre movie choices now would probably be Jared Leto.|`|zbuStsqCaa	If you knew anything about River Phoenix, you'd  know that he was in in love with his music and was very passionate about it. So I think he would have end up pursuing a career in music with his band Aleka's Attic. And he would have dropped the hollywood movie business a long time ago. I'm a huge River fan, not just because he was 'gorgeous'. But because of what he actually stood for, and what he believed in.|`|ixJSutYuaa	I think he was/would be. He was a very talented actor.

Far too many movies hold our hand throughout and doesn't let us think, not even a little.  But The Wrestler's almost a profound experience.  I personally like to think that Randy the Ram continues wrestling until he dies, which is not too much longer. Ultimately, it doesn't matter really if he died right at that point, or died later, he dies doing the only thing he really knows, and feels love doing.   That's why he doesn't go with Pam. He's messed up once again with his daughter, and he knows there's no going back. He's alone, he only feels loved in the wrestling world.  There's nothing else for him.  I need to see this movie again.

cw2KARcPaa	Try finding a karaoke version of the song, this way all you have to do is get the song, no extra programs.    Check iTunes, or if you don't want to pay for it, get Limewire and use the keyword 'karaoke' plus the title of the song, or just the artists name.|`|SPvkz1kQaa	You will need a programme to download songs, either iTunes (but you will have to pay) or Limewire (which is free). Search for the song and include the word 'karaoke' in your search, this should bring up results with just the instruments and no voice.  Hope this helps!! :)

Nel  film lei  riuscita nel suo intento ma avete notato che il compagno, Clint, poi  sparito nel nulla? llui l'amava immensamente e ... visto che era lucidissima perch non riscoprire una vita pi in profondit, che vada oltre il corpo? allora se il corpo  malato, siamo autorizzati ad ucciderci, uccidere? non ci rendiamo conto che questo non fa che creare un abisso di morte attorno e dentro noi?|`|2307cfb4991a877bd8f9e4d844dfbf2caa	nn ho ancora visto il film per ti dico la mia sull'eutanasia.

AA11536149	"A hitman and a salesman walked into a bar.... and a hilarious but strange friendship was formed making each to act in ways neither would they have imagined possible." This movie is stunningly powerful and does have a wicked twist of an ending.|`|qYX0S50daa	I thought that this was a pleasant change of pace for our favorite Irish import (my second fave is Liam Neeson). The way he comes off with all that innuendo, that slightly crazed look/speech a few months after meeting the salesman- it just worked out well for him.|`|AA11121653	I think I saw it... I do believe it was funny.|`|ekRZZdJKaa	A great example of a comedy that dealt with ambitious themes in an entertaining way. Brosnan was fantastic, and Greg Kinnear was good as well.|`|dlkJnuw6aa	I have not see it but will put it on my list to watch.|`|ADQ8jNpLaa	Well. It started out ok. Then i fell asleep. It was a little boring from what i saw of it. Maybe i will give it a second chance.|`|8068df1cd72c924194cff1a1cd68b049aa	i absolutly hated it! although the part where he starts the joke about the mn with a 12 inch d*ck while the guy is talking about his dead son was pretty funy. morbid and horrible, but strangley funny. although don't judge by me, i found Sin City and Kill Bill funny, too.
f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	I don't which was more alarming the poverty or the older women trying to let themselves go. It was a little like Swimming Pool with out the beautiful naked girl poolside. It is a movie of sharp contrasts which don't seem to make it work.|`|ekRZZdJKaa	One of those things that offends you, and yet you somehow can't take your eyes off it.

Prg3LHufaa	It is the ugly women whom are complaining. These R&B dancers are all perfect and aside from being a common whore being paid to do services they can do because of their looks they are negative "role models". Old Ugly chicks believe it is degrading because they know how well it pays and them working 9-5 wont get it. I guarantee you an attractive young girl will NEVER say it is degrading because they know they could end up doing it, or they want to.|`|ENtaLmvbaa	because it looks bad.  because all they do is look like prostitutes.  which is all women are good for, right.|`|4f745774e915e632894492b1b2427559aa	Even as an intelligent, and attractive, young woman, I'd have to say that not all of the aforementioned videos are degrading towards women, only some.

a395a29f1140f28680d45c54741e8a47aa	Todo parece tan perfecto... En los barrios residenciales las casas parecen de mu?ecas, los jardines estn tan bien cuidados, las familias lucen felices, los ni?os no corren peligros, los vecinos son tan decentes...    La serie comienza con Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) que comienza su da como siempre: prepara el desayuno para su esposo y su hijo, desarrolla sus planes cotidianos, pone en orden su tediosa vida y decide volarse la cabeza con una pistola nueva y lustrosa. A partir de esta sorprendente decisin, su presencia se transforma en una voz en off que va contndonos las vidas de sus vecinas y amigas puertas adentro.    El suicidio de Mary Alice deja tras de s un misterio que envuelve a su marido Paul Young (Mark Moses), a su hijo Zach, y a un misterioso cajn de juguetes, que Paul desenterr bajo la piscina familiar, y que al final se revela que contiene un esqueleto perteneciente al cuerpo de una mujer muerta. Al final de la temporada, la serie resuelve el misterio con la revelacin de que 15 a?os atrs, cuando el nombre de Mary Alice era Angela Forrest, ella compr a Dana, el hijo nico de la adicta a la herona Deirdre, y entonces huy con su marido Todd (ahora Paul) a Fairview (la ciudad en la que viven las protagonistas) para proteger al ni?o (ahora llamado Zach) de ser separado de sus nuevos padres. Cuando Deirdre les encuentra, Mary Alice se niega a devolverle el ni?o. Tras ser acusada de volver a las drogas, Deirdre golpea a Paul (el marido de Mary Alice) y va a buscar a su hijo. Mary Alice, en estado de shock, la asesina y hace a su horrorizado marido descuartizar el cuerpo, ponerlo en el cajn de juguetes de Zach, y enterrarlo en el lugar en que la familia estaba construyendo una nueva piscina en el patio trasero. Todo esto ocurre mientras Zach, de 4 a?os, est observndolos desde las escaleras. Con lo que Mary Alice no cont fue que una de sus vecinas, Martha Huber, conoci el secreto de Mary Alice a travs de su hermana, Felicia, (con la que Mary Alice haba trabajado antes de ir a vivir a Fairview). Tras conocer el secreto, Martha intenta chantajear a Mary Alice, pero tras leer la carta Mary Alice se suicida. Ms tarde, cuando Paul descubre la causa del suicidio, mata a Martha tras decirle que no tena ningn remordimiento por chantajearla ni por las consecuencias del chantaje. Mike (el antiguo amante de Deirdre) obtiene esta informacin de Paul al que Mike deja en el desierto (en vez de asesinarle) tras darse cuenta de que Zach es su hijo. Mike fue enviado por un jefe de la mafia, que era padre de Deidre y que necesitaba un heredero por estar en peligro de muerte.    Bree pasa por el amorio de su esposo con una vecina, la homosexualidad de su hijo y la obsesin de su farmaceutico por ella; al final su marido muere de un ataque al corazn.   Gabrielle tiene una aventura con su jardinero y lo oculta, su marido Carlos es acusado de tener esclavos y en arresto domicilario cambia las pastillas anticonceptivas de Gabrielle dejndola embarazada de alguno de los dos; al final Carlos es otra vez arrestado por romper su arresto domiciliario para buscar al amante de su mujer.   Lynette cuida a sus 4 hijos, e impide que Tom sea acendido, su marido al saber la noticia renuncia; Al final Lynette debe volver al trabajo.   Susan, tras su divorcio con Karl, pelea con Edie Britt por el amor del misterioso fontanero Mike Delfino. Despus Edie se va vivir con Karl, y Susan se queda con Mike Delfino.   ?Que pasara en la segunda temporada, con Bree viuda, con Gabrielle embarazada de alguien, con Lynette que regresa al trabajo dejando a su esposo ,Tom, en casa, con Susan y Mike, y con Zach que todava no sabe que es nieto de un multimillonario?  http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desperate_H...

Pero te puedo decir que no te sientas mal. Sentimos que ya tengas tiempo con el y lo tengas que terminar. Pero aun as, tu papa no lo aceptaba y seria muy difcil que lo hiciera y mas sabiendo que ya tenias tiempo con el.    Te recomiendo que aun as le sigas pidiendo perdn a tu mama, y disfruta la mientras los tengas a LOS DOS. Es muy difcil perder a uno y pues el novio puedes tener muchos, estas joven y tienes toda una vida por delante ;)    No te sientas mal, y aun as sigue hablando con tu mama.     Desconosco las razones de que se haya enojado pero devieron ser buenas razones, y aun cuando no lo fueran (a tu punto de vista) ellos saben lo que es mejor para ti.    Espero que de algo te sirva :D y pues no te sientas triste, mejor ponte a escuchar msica shida, vete a bailar, ve una pelcula, platica con tu mama sobre cosas de mujeres xD     Y, amalos. Quierelos, amalos. No les ocultes nada porque es duro saber que tus hijos te mienten, ponte en sus zapatos ;) y comprenderas lo que es mejor para ti :D    Saludos.    Atte.  Dj. AxL    P.D.  Espero que te sirva de algo jeje, chao besos y cuidate musho :D|`|c4k9zGexaa	Perdn amiga, pero cul es tu edad, si ya eres mayor de 14 a?os, pienso que tu padres estn exagerando su posicin de control, debas de conversar con ellos e imponer tu condicin de adolecente para que te permitan libertades  propias de la edad.

Como sabes si te dan el permiso sino lo intentas.  que puede pasar pues arriesgate cuando tu padre se entere sabe el que vas a ser lo que sea para verlo el fue joven tambien y el sabe que uno hace lo que sea asi que intentalo anda Dios te va a ayudar, lo le creo a Dios, Bendiciones luz|`|znYhrBayaa	lo mejor es enfrntar la vida como es. el hecho q tu papa no te deje tener novio es porq te quiere protejer de tipos aprovechados.

ESOO SIIIIIIIIIIIII...  no te pongas a inventar huevonadas con tu novio, cero barrigas,   disfruta  tu relacion de  manera  SANA... no hagas que  tus padres digan TE LO DIJE"    Has las cosas  bien, y q no te arrepientas de tener viento en popa  tui noviazgo...

Y... aunque te parezca imposible, a tu novio lo puedes olvidar, si te trae tantos problemas, y seguramente si te lo propones estoy casi segura que conocers algn muchacho que te enamores y tambin que conquiste a tus padres, y vivirs mas tranquila disfrutando del Amor de tu novio y de tus padres.Mucha suerte.|`|9slPZ9LEaa	mmmmmmmm.. muy dificil la situacion ruegale a tu padre que quieres ser feliz!!!!

Franchement, les bo?tes et cartons d'Arthur taient pour vous certainement plus intellectuelles ?|`|D86VokMcaa	Cauet est un imbcile, vulgaire.  Et en plus il est laid, on dirait un porcelet.|`|2ByM8ul9aa	Je trouve galement cette emission dbile mais le but c'est de cibler les pr-ados (tranche 11-14 ans), qui semblent apprcier.... Dommage car j'aime l'homme de radio mme si je pense qu'il se disperse trop. C'est comme tout, plus tu as du succs et plus tu veux tre sur le devant de la scne... il faut qu'il se mfie et qu'il ne finisse pas par se br?ler les ailes. par contre, je redis que le matin sur fun, son quipe et lui-mme me font bien marrer !!!!|`|QRqeCFfYaa	Ne t'inquite pas, cette mission dbile a fait "tellement" d'audiance qu'elle va s'arrter courant fvrier !!! J'en connait un qui doit tre vert !!!|`|YRCVGRdKaa	Cauet est un debile profond. C'est un peu le David Guetta de la tv, il nous fait croire qu'il a tout invent alors qu'il ne fait que reprendre ce qui se fait deja. Finalement ne nous plaignons pas, ailleurs c'est deja pire !|`|CqwPGNUZaa	si on doit compter sur nos producteur animateur vedette pour redresser la balance du commerce c'est sur on est foutu!  le but de cauet c'est de faire une mission tellement nulle, que le seul stimuli intellectuel que tu ressoives en la regardant ce soit la pub. "temps de cerveaux disponibles" et prparer  gober n'importe quoi. mme les dlires des pubs semblent plossibles aprs avoir vu Cauet.|`|KxBwx2tKaa	il est vrai qu'en regardant cette emission on peut se demander si TF1 prends ses telespectateurs pour des idiots ...|`|7N5Je9kfaa	Y a pas que la quotidienne qui est nulle, mme la "mthode Cauet est nulle", il invite des gebs pour leurs promo, et il ne leur reserve que 2 minutes pour eux, le reste des interviw tournent autour de cauet, de sexe et de vulgarits ...  V'est pathetique que Tf1 nous prend pour des debiles|`|QHkEdzsiaa	le but ( il l'a dit) c'tait d'attraper les collgiens et lycens a la sortie de l'cole mais c'est pas vraiment la bonne heure on rentre pas chez nous aussi tot!! 6/7 heure la ok mais 5h/5h30 ou par la c'ets impossible que quelqu'un regarde tous les jours! moi je regarde le mercredi. le but c'est de nous faire marer sinon ya la chaine parlementaire yen a que ?a amuse mais jusqu' un certain age la cauetidienne ?a passe comme une lettre a la poste! c'est sur que c'tait pas fait pour les +de 20ans!tout ce qui ne te plait pas n'est pas dbile sinon tout est dbile!!!  a+|`|v5danzfdaa	C'est toujours comme ?a avec lui...!Trop dbile  Bise|`|saKNnecCaa	Arrtez de regarder la tl ! Rien ni personne ne vous y oblige !|`|cqat9gXPaa	Personnellement, j'ai jamais regard. J'ai juste vu la bande annonce, qui ne m'a jamais attir.

Nous verrons bien combien de temps va durer la plaisanterie.|`|hp3DcJyuaa	Tu sais pas la derniere monsieur a decide comme nouveau defit de marcher sur des braises resultat brulures du 3em degres est l'hopital directo......pas de pied cauet.

C'est un vrai navet en tant qu'mission.|`|gNNMwLQFaa	ok la j'avoue c'est du nimporte quoi...  j'adore regarder son emission du jeudi soir mais franchement la quotidienne c'est completement con...

Here's another option, one that's working very well for me, I've been paid twice already, and they've got scanned images of checks they've sent, it's sooo easy, you just have to download their bar and let it run. You get points and those points equal money.     It's free and easy to join and your privacy is completely protected.

obWKkriPaa	Get a job so you'd deal with people as less as possible..... And a job so that you need no experience whatsoever with the store you're dealing with..... For example, you'd have to know a thing or two working at Best Buy, while you can just learn to grind coffee at Starbucks.......... Out of all of those..... I'd have to say Starbucks.......|`|y5FfKGAsaa	hm, maybe 3 & 6! :)|`|430e91db100ad72479d62a786f902924aa	stripper|`|KT8uUqq8aa	a theatre, it must be so fun!|`|gHTGfHHwaa	SUBWAY!

IM NOT A CREEPY OLD LADY|`|KtouqBzzaa	I think you should either apply for a job at aeropostale or a movie theater. I think a movie theater because it sounds really fun.. haha i've always wanted to work at a movie theater. And aeropostale (or any other clothing stores) because your 17 years old and you sound like you might be into fashion and stuff, so you would be more likely to get a job there (sounds cool too =])  Good luck :-D    ~Ashley!~

Orson Welles n'avait pu le raliser pour de vagues problmes de droit.  Un scnario digne de Sophocle ou d'Eschyle !  Une prsence et un jeu des acteurs inoubliables.

I think multiracial people tend to be very pretty... especially when they are exotic looking. One of the cutest guys I've known was half italian and half japanese. He had slightly tanish skin, japanese like eyes, and dark hair.     But I also tend to like diversity in all things. I love it when people can combine multiple cultures and be unique!|`|6fcbe940619104ed5872fbb65fb03d34aa	i think females that are mixed are hot..... because i am mixed as well and my baby is going to be even more mixed..... heck, look at Obama he's mixed and he's hot!!|`|p03Jc7eHaa	sure why wouldn't they be?|`|moFyK8s3aa	Yes :)  I think interracial people are very beautiful.|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	Yes they are.

I'm German, English and Swiss... My mother side only has german blood and my father side is english and swiss..    I'd be concidered 1/2 German, 1/4 Swiss and 1/4 English..|`|hDAoKmjPaa	yes i think they are. but not all there could be some ugly ones too. and just because you are mixed raced or a certain race doesnt automatically make you pretty or ugly there are ugly and pretty of every kind lol! at least to me. but you sound pretty

It should represent freedom in a sense that you can achieve what you want. (Not freedom as in you're allowed to do anything and everything you want, which is anarchy, but the ability to do what you'd like while obeying the laws.)    The ability to live your life without being ruled by the government, but while respecting your government so things have order and safety to them.    That's different than most other countries in the world.|`|6JHoNf3faa	A table cloth for dinner for some soul food bought with foo - stam.|`|AA10101702	I would like to think that it represents unity and freedom to all, despite America's turbulent history.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Probably the same all most Americans.

He never forgot that.   Personally I don't like saying goodbye, I usually sneak away and some people think its rude but I just never liked goodbye.  As far as the unique goodbye, I don't have one.  So I can't answer the question and don't belong here.|`|xxSGhywoaa	If in the morning there is no body by your side God has taken me to his place.      My grandmother said this to me all the time.

And when you get done, you can groom their eyebrows...|`|O2LQzJCtaa	Actually, I'd keep them as my friend because when I went out with ol' unibrow woman, I'd look way hotter by comparison.

Friendship is based on loyalty, kindness, and trust.

But, the weird thing is that a lot of times when I 'm alone people will start to sit with me, wave at me, or something.  But, eventually they all leave. :(    I don't know why they do that. I think they're probably just being nice.    To tell you the truth I USED to feel lonely, yeah like a loser & an outsider.    But, now I'm so sick & tired of having to feel that way that I get so angry with myself that now when I'm all alone & none of my friends are there I just try to think happy things.    "Don't worry, be happy."   That's me...    Sitting quietly  alone    smiling    "It's okay..."    But, I don't think anybody likes to be alone. If if they do say they like it.

It reminds of of when My first steady girlfriend broke up with me and gave me back the friendship Ring I had bought her. That song was popular at that time so it kind of hit home.     Others  Golden Slumbers by The Beatles  Fool's Gold - Amy Winehouse|`|NQ37mnWkaa	I'm sure you know my top choice by now...  'Gold Dust Woman' ~ Fleetwood Mac     and also :~  'Fields of Gold' ~ Sting {or Eva Cassidy}  'Gold Dust' ~ Sandy Denny      Foxy Little Devil :  Great call on John Stewart's 'Gold' :)|`|TqSGFIFUaa	fields of gold|`|Mfi2lCxpaa	band of gold|`|0763bad2e64e093bce37965f69fe43d2aa	"Band Of Gold"|`|IKCfT9tnaa	Heart of gold|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Gold Dust Woman|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	onderful, John Stewart's song, "Gold" is my favorite but out of your choices---"Fields of Gold," Sting is just the man.

However i would go with Golden years by david Bowie   and   Golden Slumber by the Beatles|`|oFv3v9Oeaa	Of your selections, I choose Sting's Field of Gold.   Wonderfully wistful song.

Ct0ESSbcaa	I had a hairdresser in '07...each appointment was a test of my endurance. That poor woman must not have had a decent poo session in months, so very kaka-esque was her breath.     Late that year I quit smoking, and went in to see her about a month later. That was IT....I never went back again. The experience was sooo much worse when my sense of smell was back to normal. =[|`|Fvw4t9Hsaa	omg my dad was talking to me today and i swear i   wanted to jump off a bridge it was so bad|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Actually, myself.  My wife told me I had bad breath.  She would not kiss me.  So I got on the internet and learned that bad breath is caused by bacteria on the top of the tongue.  I bought an OraBrush and some mouthwash and now clean my tongue every time I brush my teeth.  I was the problem and now I have fresh breath and get a kiss every time I want one.

All nanas do (;|`|PqmmyV6baa	name|`|DtBE35wHaa	it at first you insist on doing this type of thing, then I would suggest that you first think of a place that was most comforting to her and to yourself, a picture of her in sketched on your skin for a for a few days to see if your even going top like it being there, if you do then yeah go have one placed where it would not get harmed by accident / like if you were to have a car crash or something. that would be like so different it than it would not even get cut during a surgery procedure, thus the anywhere on the shoulder might be out as this is often cases of surgery sites to repair broken bones and stuff, other than that I advise that all you really need is that memory of the Great times you and her shared together while she was here with us.. and know that she is now in a much better place... how about a bible tattoo with scripture under under it ? one that she liked ?|`|88uIjItaaa	D.O.B and Her Name and R.I.P    A Heart and her name|`|73455c6a787c90036b88c6c36738f763aa	Dear Emery,  Just tattoo your nan's full name (year of birth - year of passing) somewhere on your right arm.

c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	I don't actually, I think it's attractive when a girl doesn't wear any make up.|`|7b785af8d1983d840827831f0028c949aa	I don't mind a bit of make up, but if she piles it on like a clown, I couldn't deal with it. Considering she'd take so long to put it on that it might get ruined or faded away sooner or later, I don't think that a girl should put on more than she needs. If it complements her looks, it's good enough.    I'm not picky for color.|`|kOo9KgZ5aa	just about any kind looks good as long as it doesn't look like it was applied with a paint roller|`|YoS8BWApaa	yes|`|pqSGMukvaa	yeh...but not too much, only a little bit  ...to much makes them look fake    and no guy pays attention to what kind...i dont think|`|u1BX2aw0aa	Just a little bit of makeup.

W2AWSMxDaa	only thing is i think the film was too short and at times seemed a little rushed like one minute you are like oh this is happening and then whip crack on to the next (slightly confusing ) reading the book is a must or you wont have a clue whats going on in the film     the DA meetings were absolute top class the best scenes in the whole series in my opinion     i honestly felt like i was attending hogwarts and i was in the film it totally capsures your imagination and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster     loona lovegood was my favorite charactor she is so funny just how i imagined     have to say though the film was great anyway well worth watching !!!!!!!!!!!! WELL WORTH WATCHING!!!!|`|1cd86f54f4d86eea42dcdfbb5cd9467daa	i saw the movie with my kids yesterday..i read the books they haven't. they liked the movie but i thought it was boring and left out so many things from the book..they kept all the important facts in the movie but changed the way they were explained to us in the book...the end was the best because of the battle and the effects were good but it really was nothing compared to the book! hagrid is barely in the movie as is malfoy which was a bummer cause i love the bickering  between him and harry...they are hardly in the black house at all and sirius blacks mother is not shown in the movie at all....hope that helps you considering the price of movie tickets lol|`|24PTSuWJaa	1. If you read the book.. don't watch the movie.    2. If you watch the movie... don't read the book.    Choose ONLY one or else you will be very very very disappointed.|`|cjWkWSPWaa	just a little better|`|H5nQkb0gaa	I saw an advanced screening and it was fun.

IYF4xSTdaa	it is a mightier that you act they put on cause they think that they are so smart and only deserve a 6 figure job...one of my friends is like that ...has a wife who do not work,and two kids,sponges on everyone and when ask why he is not working he is waiting for big money...every time he get a job he leaves cause he says that the boss is to stupid,and don't know what he is doing..he is still not working and his wife feels bad,and cries all the time,cause he don't want her to work...so I know what you are talking about..talk to your dad about it..tell him how you feel..there must be someone you could talk to and get some kind of help..|`|AA11609168	Hes your brother, what are you being so cold?    I have two brothers and neither one of them is perfect, but you have to enjoy them for who they are and while they are here.  Dont let the little stuff stop you from being brothers.    I personally think you are a pretty shallow for feeling the way you do.  You should be ashamed of yourself for talking about your brother like that.

Hzf3QK9faa	I never had a sloppy joe until I had a best friend who came from Salt Lake City. Now I have my very own sloppy Joe (well, sometimes, but he cleans up real nice!). I really like tacos but they're a little too spicy sometimes for honey so I can't be having them all the time and not be considerate to my love.  And your welcome. :)|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Sloppy Joes|`|08s03qFGaa	taacooosss|`|9DAzssMiaa	Sloppy Joe's. All they are is hamburger and tomato sauce. Add some herbs, whatever. I use my own home made meatballs to make them. Slap it between a bun or bread, supper is ready. It is more American I think. :)|`|XAioHGKbaa	Tacos but I also like Sloppy Joes|`|k9DWHrJ7aa	sloppy joe for me. (its sloppy, just as advertised) fast and easy to make. i don't care all that much for tacos. most people use hamburger buns, but i like to use thick sliced bread placed on a plate and cover the bread with sloppy joe mix and eat it with a fork. cole slaw as a side dish.|`|AA10353121	I enjoy sloppy joes with a few chips and pickles on the side.|`|t9htoO50aa	Dizz in Ontario we knew about Sloppy Joe's way before Taco's.

AA11815754	Polar Bears have black skin, each individual little hair is hollow. When polar bears are kept in a zoo their hair takes on a green tinge because algae grows in the hollow shafts of their hair.        Hair grows THICK in between polar bears' toes. When polar bears walk they spread their toes right before laying their paw on the ice and snow. The hair in between their toes then spreads, protecting the pad of the polar bears paw from coming in direct contact with the ice and snow which  keeps their paws from icing up. =)       Polar bears were also given larger paws than any other bear, which provides a larger area that their weight is distributed on ice making it harder for them to fall through thin ice.|`|mQgoqrC9aa	I have a butt.|`|kOo9KgZ5aa	ice cubes|`|4C1dH1ryaa	im planing on goin to the peace corp before i turn 28|`|kNnqjlWiaa	they made vegetarian hot pockets for people who don't eat meat but still want diarrhea|`|ZkgHQX5haa	your awesome|`|Oc8OJpbiaa	Dog The Bounty Hunter is on at 9:30 |`|JHYwzWSbaa	i'm 18 in 6 days...oh and...halo wars is coming out on the 28th of february 8-|!!

411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	considering I am getting over stomach flu and my youngest vomited last night, and my hubby did too, cleaning up the youngest's mess, I don't think I'll be eating.  That leaves my middle daugher,and I'll make her what she wants.  Hubby gets what he would like,and i'll have ramen noddles or chicken noodle soup.  Food !?   uuuuhghghg  Icky food.   Gross, nasty food.  grody jodies.  Food.   Humph!        My youngest will ask for ramen noodles and I will oblige, because i love her.  My oldest will ask for hot dogs,and i'll oblige,because I love her.  Hubby will ask for soemthing,and I'll ponder it and make it,and it will be either what his favorite, ( the middle child) wants or what the baby wants.  He never wants what I want.      :(   I want broth.  I want to cuddle my teddy bear and go to sleep.  I want Heath Ledger to whisper sweet nothings in my ear and tell me he loves me and that hubby can go to hell.  Oh,wait, you didn't ask that,did u?  My bad.  Broth.

I don't know if anyone told you but, Mercury is in retrograde  Mercury is the planet that rules Virgo. Go to Susan Miller's Astrology Zone.

Justin Timberlake done got it!|`|9phG0LWDaa	heya,  VIRGO  August 23 - September 22       Your element:    Earth     Your ruling planets:    Mercury   Symbol:    The Virgin   Your stone:    Sapphire     Life Pursuit:   To do the right thing   Vibration:    Compassionate and caring   Secret Desire:    To love and be loved in return   Fame Factor:   Immaculate & Minimalist. Being optimistic and unpretentious gains popularity.     Star-style:    Helmut Lang - Dries Van Noten.     Astro Cocktail:    Something natural - Apple Martini     Astro Affirmation:    I'm a magnet for love and friendship         When a Virgo shines, there is practically no sign to match their inner light. An in-tune Virgo is a treat to meet. When a Virgo is confident within themselves they are the most successful, structured and creative of all the signs.     One of the most magical characteristics of the Virgo is no matter how many times life or romance turns sour on them, they still manage to maintain faith in others, refusing to become cynical. Virgos can often become victims of relationship power-games, where they are mistreated.     Creative and sensitive, Virgos are delicate people who require individual treatment to fully blossom into their true unique beauty. Shy, they are happy to allow others to take centre-stage and often generate their time and energy into making those they love happy or successful.     Virgos understand human frailties better than most, because they are so deep and reflective themselves. With a Virgo in your life you have someone who understands and cares.|`|f9d4a754d8e39461f5a72440a76c6489aa	sorry darling .your love seems to be dull.better you find out Job .take advice from your parents do according to that

Y para el que respondi que esta pelcula le di asco y que como heterosexual qu ganaba al verla, pues lo que dej de ganar fue el conocer uno de los primeros clsicos del cine del nuevo milenio, una historia emotiva y estremecedora que no deja indiferente a nadie, y una de las pocas pelculas capaces de hacerte reflexionar y valorar.|`|667b2e602ea76281191279e189b4eef1aa	Las escenas de sexo se ven grotescas...

Me causa gracia la gente que dice que es muy fuerte, o que le repugnaron las escenas 'fuertes', por que el sexo solo es 'fuerte' y 'repugnante' si es entre una pareja de hombres gay, pero no cuando muestran , y por toneladas, parejas hetero teniendo relaciones?? he ahi el prejuicio.  Por cierto, muy buenas actuaciones, creibles; un guion bien escrito, sin sensacionalismo, ni frases cliches; bien dirigida, sin caer en el morbo; un amor sencillo, real, sin pretensiones, que transmite; excelente banda sonora; y el final me encanto, que otra cosa mas diciente que una camisa sin due?o??

AA10460778	I took it as Batman telling cop guy (Jim Gordon) that they have a type of mutual respect and trust for each other.  Kinda like I got your back, you got mine.  I think Batman was acknowledging that he trusted Jim enough to leave Rachel with him when she needed help, plus he let Jim drive the batmobile.  That's trust!|`|Ok4EcvuAaa	Yeah pretty much Batman doesnt care if he gets the "thank yous" because he knows he's doing the right thing

I'm even born in Quebec but I don't call myself Quebecois because my parents aren't born in Quebec.

I am of Irish descent as well, and live a lifestyle I was brought up in under an Irish family.  But I am Canadian.  You are an American of Irish Descent.  But you are still an American.    Your other subject however is an Irish citizen.  He is Irish.

Those born under this Sign have the social conscience needed to carry us into the new millennium. These folks are humanitarian, philanthropic and keenly interested in making the world a better place. Along those lines, they'd like to make the world work better, which is why they focus much of their energy on our social institutions and how they work (or don't work). Aquarians are visionaries, progressive souls who love to spend time thinking about how things can be better. They are also quick to engage others in this process, which is why they have so many friends and acquaintances. Making the world a better place is a collaborative effort for Aquarians.    The Sign of Aquarius is symbolized by the Water Bearer. In much the same way that the Water Bearer brings that precious liquid as a gift, Aquarians shower the world with their thoughts and new ideas. Luckily for Aquarians (and the rest of us), they are at a near-genius level, so their minds churn out some amazing things. Their thought process is also inventive and original. While Aquarians are happy to bestow these ideas as a gift with no strings attached, they are much happier when the rest of the world agrees with them. Naysayers will quickly find out that Aquarians can be impatient, even temperamental, with those who disagree. Yes, these folks can be quite fixed in their opinions, in keeping with the Fixed Quality assigned to this Sign. Even though Aquarians are happy to give, and they do, it's often on their terms and within their comfort level. Generally, that means ample space, since these folks are freedom-loving and individualistic and need to roam (and yes, they do enjoy travel). While Aquarians are generally sympathetic and compassionate, they like it when things go their own quirky way. Some might call their behavior eccentric (and they would be right), but when you consider that the Aquarian's heart is truly in the right place, a few oddities should be overlooked. In their own way, Aquarians treasure their many friends and acquaintances and want to give back as much as they can.|`|53724028471acfbb9acd87460accfb0eaa	pretty much aquarius like to wear its heart on its shoulder... very stubborn n its very hard to change their opinion on somethin....|`|AA11972607	I'm an Aquarius myself,+Unpredictable.-Searching love from all at the same time and wrong places!|`|AA11081062	i'm one..if you find out anything let me know!    Prepare yourself: This month opens with just about everything going right on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd. Your hair looks good. Your soul feels light. Your loved ones love you. You love them. Your 'liked ones' like you. Ditto in reverse. Your ideas are good. You've got a certain je ne sais quoi that lets you bring new things (work projects, love affairs) into being. Wow. Enjoy this month, because you've got a special touch that lights up everything around you. On the 8th and 9th, if you have a hunch that what your community really needs is a children's playground with structures shaped like giant vegetables, heck, you're onto something. So make it happen! On the 11th, you could be ready to make a much-needed relationship change -- for the better. On the 16th, if you think you need to take a power nap and stop missing the gym, well, you're right about both of those things, too. By the 20th and 21st, you're writing your speech for the zoning board about the kiddie park with the asparagus swing set (and it's great!). On the 25th, you resolve a tricky emotional situation by cooking dinner. On the 30th, rain or shine, you feel pretty darned good!  Thats what i got! =)

hNCiw6Laaa	The addiction really is a tough one as i played video games every spare minute!! Sell the games you don't play and keep your games to a minimum. Play only one game at a time and give yourself maybe 3 hour slots then gradually reduce your slot times???|`|hkdP9Rtyaa	Cold Turkey, thats the way forward. Just ask John Lennon. Cold Turkey was the way I conquered my addiction to Lemsip Hot Lemons. I woulda been drinkin between 15 and 25 sachets a day.  It done terrible damage to my liver, I can't drink as much as I used to, but at least now I can get full on only a litre of whiskey. Which reminds me of a rather funny story I have about a bridge. Late on an warm August afternoon, Tobias and Reginald went for a carfree stroll along the river banks. Along the river bank was a bridge. The two young yobs went to cross the bridge to the otherside, as they went to cross the bridge to the otherside, the bridge collapsed. Sweeping the two young slappers into the raging river. And that was the last time anyone ever heard from Tobias and Reginald, known forever as Bumblescum's Young Uns.  Your thinking "Thats not a funny story!!!"? Well I guess you just had been there.  Sorry drifted away there, as to your problem, hmmm....... let me see now........ what about giving your controllors to your parents to keep through out the school week so you can have time to study and then play it at the weekends?

There's an abandoned strip mine about 1/4 mile from my house. When my children were small, we'd spend our time messing around over there, and one day, we happened to pick up a leaf fossil.    This set the passion burning, and for 3 consecutive summers, the kids and I had our own archaeological dig going across the street. We must have moved more than a ton of rocks into my garage, and during the winter months we'd spend long hours gently scraping away the rock to reveal our finds.    We've got various leaves, ferns, wood, etc. All plants, no animals. A few specimens are spectacular, clear, and vibrant, with one being a large piece of sandstone showcasing 3 attractively overlapping fossils of various woods. They have  colors and textures, and seem alive in their clarity.    Neighbors soon learned of our interests, and a friend who travels to Wyoming each year started bringing us huge pieces of shale to examine. In 3 of these pieces, we unearthed tiny fish. There are other little critters also, but I don't know what they are.    This same neighbor gave to us her husband's fossil collection after his death. This collection includes bones, teeth, various sea shells, bellamnites (squids), other sea critters, and my favorite --parts of 2 dinosaur eggs.    Fueled by our fossil hunting days, my kids and I also went on to collect crystals and geodes. This led to collecting and polishing rocks of various types, and now my house is completely overrun, and parts of it look like a museum. Somehow, I can't bring myself to part with any of them.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Books , but lots and lots of them, so I don't have room in my apartment.|`|KS4a4QmLaa	yes|`|K6KIfZb7aa	nope :)|`|mQk1c6UAaa	Belly button lint.|`|CEwV9Kf2aa	Your Mom's panties.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	nope, just anything sports|`|qVRmpGlEaa	Various public hairs..

XxGS5NQ8aa	Next time you have a bad day, think of this guy. Rob is a commercial saturation diver for Global Divers in Louisiana. He performs underwater repairs on offshore drilling rigs. Below is an E-mail he sent to his sister. She then sent it to radio station 103.2 FM in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, who was sponsoring a worst job experience contest. Needless to say, she won.     Hi Sue, Just another note from your bottom-dwelling brother. Last week I Had a bad day at the office. I know you've been feeling down lately at work, So I thought I would share my dilemma with you to make you realize it's Not so bad after all.   Before I can tell you what happened to me, I first must bore you with a few technicalities of my job. As you know, my office lies at the bottom of the sea. I wear a suit to the office. It's a wetsuit. This time of year the water is quite cool. So what we do to keep warm is this: We have a diesel powered industrial water heater. This $20,000 piece of equipment sucks the water out of the sea. It heats it to a delightful temperature. It then pumps it down to the diver through a garden hose, which is taped to the air hose. Now this sounds like a pretty good plan, and I've used it several times with no complaints. What I do, when I get to the bottom and start working, is take the hose and stuff it down the back of my wetsuit. This floods my whole suit with warm water. It's like working in a Jacuzzi.     Everything was going well until all of a sudden, my butt started to itch. So, of course, I scratched it. This only made things worse. Within a few seconds my butt started to burn. I pulled the hose out from my back, but the damage was done. In agony I realized what had happened. The hot water machine had sucked up a jellyfish and pumped it into my suit. Now, since I don't have any hair on my back, the jellyfish couldn't stick to it.     However, the crack of my butt was not as fortunate. When I scratched what I thought was an itch, I was actually grinding the jellyfish into the crack of my butt. I informed the dive supervisor of my dilemma over the communicator. His instructions were unclear due to the fact that he, along with five other divers, were all laughing hysterically. Needless to say I aborted the dive. I was instructed to make three agonizing in-water decompression stops totaling thirty-five minutes before I could reach the surface to begin my chamber dry decompression. When I arrived at the surface, I was wearing nothing but my brass helmet. As I climbed out of the water, the medic, with tears of laughter running down his face, handed me a tube of cream and told me to rub it on my butt as soon as I got in the chamber. The cream put the fire out, but I couldn't poop for two days because my butt was swollen shut. So, next time you're having a bad day, think about how much worse it would be if you had a jellyfish shoved up your butt.     |`|72ae4bb079da8ac6111927b2daa3c225aa	why didnt the strict parent take her children to the symphony performance? . . . because its full of sax and violins. . haha|`|zq1fGpOsaa	My last girlfriend didnt like me thought she might be  Most likely a dyke she just didnt excite me  Lefty? yeah but that was alright  She was hotter than the sun but she just wasnt that bright  My mistake she was more flaky than a leper colony  I think a wooden clothespin would have been much better company  *** like a donkey acting funky gave her L now shes a flunky  So my love for her died quicker than a batch of sea monkeys  Early bird gets the worm spread your legs or spread the word  So what if Im not the smartest peanut in the turd  Im white which goes with everything but I can come in any color  And Im looking for the kind of girl that reminds me of my mother  But its hard to find a girl with a viper tattooed on her tushy  And how many girls do you know that can play the harmonica with their *******?

AA10200112	Well I have been through two divorces in my lifetime and hope for no more...  It is so painful to be the one that is left behind...  It was never my fault...  I had to spend time grieving to allow myself to heal from the pain...  It is different for each human being and there is no real time limit...  One day you will wake up and it wont hurt any longer and you will wonder why you spent so much time weeping...  My counselor told me something I will never forget...  She told me that no one is weeping for you...  They are not losing sleep over you and they went on with their life like you were never there...  I have always remembered that bit of advice and remembered not to linger too long or dwell too long on those that hurt me...  You just take the time needed to grieve and mourn and then when you are tired of crying, you will heal...  |`|mggll8dRaa	The Sooner, The Better; Good Luck...!!|`|9d0f728b3338ed9ffccbf02630a332c3aa	It's different for everyone. It's been 10 months for me and though the pain has lessened and I don't cry every time I hear his name, I don't think I will ever be completely over him. But, I have learned that life goes on, and I have met other people.  Best of luck to you.|`|B3N388wBaa	Well, it depends on how long you were with the girl. I went out with a guy for 2 1/2 years, and it took me almost a year and a half to get over him. No one knows really how long it will take, but it'll take time. Just give it time, and it'll possibly pass. :3|`|dqCTS60raa	two months|`|1CEApjyRaa	Today because tomorrow God may bring someone better into your life and if you are dwelling on this other person you may pass up a once in a life time opportunity to be with that person.    **EDIT** give me thumbs down all you want it's not hurting me in anyway The reason I said much easier said than done is becasue I was with my baby's dad for 7 mos this nov 22 would have been a year. I am 32 wks pregnant with his son and heart broken over the whole situation. But at the same time I know God has someone better for me that he will bring into my life. No I am not over him. But I know I deserve better and I don't want to miss that by letting my emotions and hurt from my ex stand in the way. I was trying to be encouraging!!|`|H90uflbFaa	when they have gotten over you|`|430e91db100ad72479d62a786f902924aa	immediately.  no reason to linger on.|`|gaBDMGUTaa	It is supposed to take half the time you were together for. :S I dunno. It worked for me though.|`|orXTbOY8aa	Depending on how long you guys went out. If you went out for a year than it will take you about a year to get over that person. Trust me. May seem like a long time, but its true. Just double the amount of time you were with her and there ya go...|`|qCCn17DRaa	There's no time like the present.. i spose|`|AA10744842	as soon  as now|`|5296c209e5110b6da055a14f5c7d7af8aa	There is no appropriate time.  If she broke up with you and you never had a clue (thought every thing was cool), it could take a year.  If it was a spiteful break up or if you two just grew apart, it could take a week, a month or anytime at all.  If it's because of a death, it could take the rest of your life.      You just need to take it one day at a time and it will get easier and easier until one day, you find the relationship to be a pleasant (hopefully) memory that you can talk about and smile.

Maybe if the husband could get to know the dog, he would have second thoughts about not wanting another one.    It's difficult for me to imagine what I would do, because I've never been married and I want to have more pets in the future but I can't at the moment, because I don't have enough stability in my life.      The most important thing is that the dog has a loving home. :)|`|7iEk06aDaa	I do that with my cats.

It is soooooooo fun probably!LOL! :)    Here is a star!                          Or you could get a movie/game/book etc.! I bought a CSI kit the other day and i love it too! it is so cool! :)|`|bEqBVsbsaa	Maybe like a big set of colored pencils. That could be around  $25 dollars maybe. Or you could buy a really pretty picture where you match the color to the paint. I like the Thomas Kinkade pictures. You can get that type of stuff at WalMart or most likely Hobby Lobby.      Haha, I love that type of stuff too. :)    OHH, and I have a play tent. AWESOME-NESS! :)|`|lbB4lq6Daa	some awesome clothes =] like there are a lot clearances around    or a cool cd or a movie ? =]  or a BOOK!!|`|ZivgciCLaa	Ok I am 11 too and that crap is gay!

OR  A lot of craft stores sell items that are meant to paint. They are usually wood. You could get a chest, or a picture frame, a bird house, jewelry box, or just a random box. They are usually only around $3 to $5 and you can decorate them yourself.     I'm not sure what kind of toys are out there but I know i'm a sucker for arts and crafts. good luck!!|`|u0DCP1OSaa	small toys u can sleep in a tent for a day but then what are you gona do with it?|`|nEZNf91saa	I have no idea what those things are|`|K8QRRp2Oaa	http://www.walmart.com/browse/Toys/_/N-2...    all of these are under 20 bux so good luck =P|`|320b2762f5cd39e51c805fc8b1bb91bbaa	OUTFIT.....

You seem so sweet....good luck ?|`|AfEnS2I4aa	small toys   have fun sweetheart|`|FueMPm7Uaa	hmm im 12 and no one wanted a play tent small toys or stuff like that when i was11... go get urself an itunes giftcard or a cd or some cool clothes.|`|hZ9omSataa	i loved Toys when i was 11, but coloring stuff may be cool, because then you get to use your imagination...|`|0U53vlhEaa	I would get clothes!

TRUST ME!|`|3Y6xb4YCaa	if you have an idea on what you want that is good if you want direction then i would suggest a charity that helps children who are in need of food, water, shelter there are so many needy causes giving Your support to those is a great idea|`|YxXBrRq4aa	i'd buy one of those art sets that have lots of crayons, markers, pastels, etc|`|xcmUSZLTaa	personally..i would go with something jonas brothers..but thats me..    hmmm.. maybe like...a book.  lol no jk.  umm... a movie!!|`|Og3vKQeWaa	that`s about 10.00 in our money(I think) so CS is out, a play tent is probably a bit childish for an 11 year old, small toys, hmmm that could mean a lot of things, but I still think you are too grown up for toys, so I suggest a nice take away pizza,chinese,indian and an drink!  Oh and watch out for the 15 year old kid on here, asking if 11 is too young to date, sounds like a pervert!|`|EGuM1LU1aa	Counter-Strike Source? isn't that like $40? Are you a guy? ...

uOJBMcvzaa	if you're at home go into a room with nothing distracting, like tv/phone/windows with nice views etc. Try mellow classical music (the piano by candlelight series is good). Treat yourself with short breaks when you finish a project (have a snack, go for a walk, make a call). Best idea though is go to a local or school library and sit in one of those desks with the blinders on both sides in a quiet corner and just get down to it. that's what got me through college (plus lots of coffee and the occasional adderall) :-p   good luck.|`|88uIjItaaa	Watch TV and Play Videogames....|`|QpPzXqIVaa	i have studying issues, too! it's what i'm WORST at. the problem is procrastination, you have to sit down in a QUIET ROOM, at a hard table (flat surface) in a hard, uncomfortable chair. well, not too uncomfortable. the key is to put yourself in a position where you will not fall asleep. also, despite what you think, you will NOT get anything done during the commercials. so sit somewhere quiet where nobody is going to bother you and really, studying goes much faster if you get it done with. then you're free to do other things, like playing video games or something i dunno. that's what i do haha. also, don't start studying late at night... do it earlier, force yourself to start, and it'll be easier once you get going. take breaks after every subject (i have 7 classes at school, so i take a 15 minute-ish break between each homework assignment.) studying sucks. nobody likes it. but you have to do it!    i hope that helped!  good luck =)|`|oVRA1ze2aa	music|`|YxXBrRq4aa	sit in silence until you start|`|GcmWe4vXaa	sorry i couldnt help u here, i dont study|`|PJSWHMEHaa	Whether you hate it is of no import.

To me I think that being a lawyer is pretty hard. But, I hear they make a lot of money. I think you have to be smart to be a lawyer. You need the best evidence to defend the person your defending.     Japanese? Well, that's a little hard. I'm learning Japanese right now & I already learned a few words.    JAPANESE: Choose this if you think speaking in Japanese will be useful.  If you already know another language besides English then, you don't have to take that class. Being bilingual is a VERY good thing to be.    BUSINESS LAW: I think you can get a lot of money from this, also it seems more useful than speaking Japanese. Are you good at it? If your quite the logical person I say you take this.     Speaking Japanese is pretty impressive to me. But, business law sounds very impressive to me. All sophisticated & stuff.  A lot of people date important people. Doctors, people in politics, etc.|`|Q3KnqbZ2aa	well duhhh.|`|5IsOgX8jaa	You don't have to be japanese to speak japanese. xD So take Japanese. Its sounds fun.

c6ff08c632b9e5165a8a3d098d3a1710aa	http://www.jeep.com/en/2008/liberty/    They shouldn't name jeeps as such :-)    Liberty comes with a "price," and that price is something that I am against-If lives are taken in any sense to allow me to have freedom then I would rather not have freedom.    Many will disagree with me on that opinion, but I don't like the idea of another dying for my freedom-    I was speaking with someone about these wars going on recently. They were trying to justify wars as being OK'd by God. "Man" has Ok'd it-not God. They said if they did fight for our freedom we would be able to Worship Jesus Christ. My thoughts on that are;    I worship a Living God, Not a killing God.    Great Question :-)    Ps. Nice Jeep by the way lol|`|yGQgdYNwaa	Wasn't Lady Liberty free?

aKCUZM3jaa	Ozzy Osbourne and Cinderella|`|rkkIyPoQaa	Well, I've seen tribute CD's to hair bands (in general), and one particular one had punk bands playing hair band covers, but they were covering Maiden and Ozzy stuff, which were never really hair bands, although Ozzy did have some poppy songs and in the 80's, big hair, the music was never really akin to Slaughter, Ratt, Warrant etc.    Also, The Scorpions. They were arena rock during the hair band days, but never really a hair band. They were also more of a 70's band than an 80's band. They debuted in the 70's, and actually started in the 60's.|`|kivwSfpgaa	oh man those bands were glamtastic!!! haha i dunno. i love all 80s music.    ive heard bon jovi be called 'hair metal' i mean they had big hair back in the day but to me the big hair bands were one (maybe 2 or 3) hit wonders. jon and the gang are still spittin out number ones and selling out concerts left and right|`|RusTwYZnaa	Vixen..   I hate them!  Def leopard.. I love them but they're not even close to hair metal.  and bands that only had hits that were ballads, like Firehouse, Europe, Sheriff.  Oh and kiss, i wouldn't even consider them music.    But i love me sum hair metal.|`|CjxwKrHzaa	I don't think Bon Jovi or Poison deserved that label.  I think it was just the look and trend of that time for bands to have big long hair and then they got automatically labelled hair metal.|`|blye7Aqlaa	GN'R  Van Halen    Neither of these bands are what I would consider hair metal.|`|x3vhAFMyaa	I don't think:    Guns N' Roses  Night Ranger  Quiet Riot  Van Halen    should have been. these bands are all hard rock|`|VWwepyibaa	Y&T and Van Halen

8c7bf137622212d1f93185b154201dc2aa	www.abc.com.  Lets you watch previous episodes of lost and other shows.    But here goes.    Michael the guy with the kidnapped kid, shoots liby the blond lady who likes that fat funny guy,Hurley.   He also shoots anna lucia the ex cop.      Michael then lets the captured 'bad' guy one of the 'others' go.    He then proceeds to lead four of his friends into a trap, Sawyer, Kate, the doc, and Hurley.    The middle eastern guy convinces Jack the doc that michael is setting a trap for them in order to get the 'others' to release his son.  The four and michael go anyway, because Jack and middle eastern came up with this plan.     So the middle eastern guy and the asian couple go sailing to the other side of the island to meet up with the four and michael to set a trap for the bad guys the 'others'.    In the mean time the old mysterious guy, Locke, is in the hatch with the french guy and the African.  The mysterious guy wants the clock to run out but the African believes bad things will happen.  The french guy is kinda drunk and doesn't care so he sides with the mysterious guy to see what would happen if the clock ran out.  Remember they have to input those freaky numbers in order to restart the clock.  They all end up fighting but in the end the time does ran out and a wierd sonic boom that was deafening to the people on the island occured.    So in the end three things are happening.    The four led into the trap are captured.  The fat nice guy, Hurley is let go by the 'others'.  So we see Kate, sawyer and Jack the doc all tied up on their knees.  Michael did get his son and the two go sailing off to freedom.    The middle easter guy and the asian couple are still sailing towards the doc and them but eventually figure out they were heading the wrong way.    The sonic boom that occurs after time runs out on the clock leaves three possible deaths, the african, the mysterious old guy and the french guy.|`|7aac53fcb81fe6581a3768f12cbd4ca2aa	They all catch a virulent strain of Hep C and die of kidney failure.|`|901815eab95d03d5b2cc97621dd23de3aa	The plane is coming apart at the seams and we are seeing an extended dream of Walt's as the plane plummets from the sky.

Locke and the other guy aren't dead, but the hatch area is basically unusable.  However, since there was some sort of major explosion, it went up like a signal (which desmond's girlfriend had guys looking for-trying to find him).    Kate, Jack, Sawyer and Hurley are captured and with the "others".  Henry shows up (guy captured and held in the hatch previously) and turns out he is the leader of the "others".    So far, people on the island are alive.    for spoilers, try http://www.spoilerfix.com  for lost episodes (and word by word transcripts of episodes) try: http://www.lost-tv.com/

8f5222f467df5b930e9022bc442ba2f3aa	I purchased my first ukulele six months ago and just bought another one.  Here's what I've learned:  you want to get something with a good action and decent sound.  For that you will need to spend at least $150 to $250.  The best resource is flea music.  There are really good forums and you will find recommendations for starter ukes.  Some of the folks on the forums like the flea and the fluke.  I think the necks are too wide.  I bought a soprano Tangi, hand made in Hawaii and paid $150 on ebay.   My ukulele retains for $250.  I may be interested in selling it at a discount, so if your research leads to you to a hand-made soprano, please contact me and I'll quote you a price.  Ebay is a good place to learn about your options.  I would stay away from the inlaid ukes that are going for $100.  No guarantees of quality and the shipping is $80.  Over this past weekend I played a couple of old Martins, considered the best quality ukes and they were really spectacular but also really pricey:  $1300 for a Martin 2 from the 20s and $700 for a Martin 1.  I ended up buying a Gretsch on the recommendation of my ukulele teacher who told me that they have a Martin-like sound for much less money.  It is coming today so we'll see.|`|1d0540c7c06715784b6d2683072e3b4eaa	six strings are harder......if you want a really good uke...they are sorta expencive.....the best ones are like....400- 800 $ but if you want 2 jus purchase a turisty type one...it will sound ok, but not as good as a more expencive 1.....hope this helps!!!

Voltou pela estrada para procurar, andou mais ou menos uns 5 km., l estava a maria , sentada na beira da estrada esperando o jose.  ___O que aconteceu ! disse ele;  __Na barcada eu ca, te chamei , mas n?o ouviste, ent?o resolvi esperar!

A Tempestade                  O Pssaro e o homem tem essncias diferentes.            O homem vive  sombra de leis e tradi??es por ele inventadas;            o pssaro vive segundo a lei universal que faz girar os mundos.            Acreditar  uma coisa; viver conforme o que se acredita  outra.            Muitos falam como o mar, mas vivem como os pantanos.            Muitos levantam a cabe?a acima dos montes;            mas sua alma jaz nas trevas das cavernas.            A civiliza??o  uma arvore idosa e carcomida,            cujas flores s?o a cobi?a e o engano e cujas frutas            s?o a infelicidade e o desassossego.            Deus criou os corpos para serem os templos das almas.            Devemos cuidar desses templos para que sejam            dignos da divindade que neles mora.            Procurei a solid?o para fugir dos homens, de suas leis,            de suas tradi??es e de seu barulho.            Os endinheirados pensam que o sol e a lua e as estrelas se levantam            dos seus cofres e se deitam nos seus bolsos.            Os polticos enchem os olhos dos povos com poeira            dourada e seus ouvidos com falsas promessas.            Os sacerdotes aconselham os outros,            mas n?o aconselham a si mesmos,            e exigem dos outros o que n?o exigem de si mesmos.            V?  a civiliza??o. E tudo o que est nela  v?o.            As descobertas e inven??es nada s?o sen?o brinquedos            com a mente se diverte no seu tdio.            Cortar as distancias, nivelar as montanhas,            vencer os mares, tudo isso n?o passa de            aparncias enganadoras, que n?o alimentam o            cora??o e nem elevam a alma.            Quanto a esses quebra-cabe?as, chamados cincias e artes,            nada s?o sen?o cadeias douradas com os quais o homem            se acorrenta, deslumbrados com seu brilho e tilintar.            S?o os fios da tela que o homem tece desde o inicio            do tempo sem saber que, quando terminar sua obra,            ter construdo a pris?o dentro da qual ficar preso.            Uma coisa s merece nosso amor e nossa dedica??o, uma coisa s...             o despertar de algo no fundo dos fundos da alma.            Quem o sente n?o o pode expressar em palavras.            E quem n?o o sente, n?o poder nunca conhec-lo atravs de palavras.

ed92e489a1031cb0d55cb9a18203b7eaaa	Aquarius & Sagittarius     When Sagittarius and Aquarius join together in a love match, Aquarian ideals and Sagittarian knowledge combine to make them a creative and unique couple. This partnership is uninhibited, and while it can get competitive with these two, there's never a dull moment! Underneath any romantic overtone, there exists a great friendship; their Signs are two apart and this tends to give them an ability to communicate well as well as an excellent rapport. Both are idealistic and excited about life, and together they enjoy great times. Together, the two can fly without fear of falling.     Many Sagittarius-Aquarius relationships enjoy the feeling of mutual admiration. Sagittarius is attracted to Aquarius's individuality, vision and creative capacity. Aquarius admires Sagittarian excellence and initiative -- Sagittarius is always coming up new ideas, but they aren't always able to carry them out the way Aquarius can. Both Signs relish their independence, and there aren't many conflicts because each understands this about the other. At times, Sagittarius may seem too selfish for Aquarius, who in turn may be too out-there for their Sagittarian partner. As long as they communicate their happiness about the relationship, they will overcome any bumps in the road, major or minor.     Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter and Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Saturn and Uranus. These three Planets form a sort of cycle that typifies the Sagittarius-Aquarius relationship, especially their ability to see eye-to-eye. Uranus is the Planet of new ideas and creativity; it's from this Planet that Aquarius gets its grandiose ideas. Then Jupiter steps in with its influences toward higher learning, expansion and abundance. Finally Saturn keeps the process going to completion, following up after Uranus's inspiration has been exhausted and Jupiter's energy moves on to new things.     Sagittarius is a Fire Sign and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and keeps it going much in the same way that Aquarius can inspire Sagittarius to make great leaps. Sagittarius can keep up with the Water Bearer's tendency to engage in experiments based on futuristic ideas. When they come together, they are an innovative, inventive team! Aquarius and Sagittarius use intellect and a sense of adventure to gain new experiences -- each fosters creativity in the other. Both Signs have a wide variety of interests, and Sagittarius's need to get in on the action gives them ease with which to put the plans of the idea-generating Aquarius into action.     Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Sag rolls with the punches and is happy to stop what they are doing to tend to other matters. Aquarius is slightly less adjustable, more into sustaining a project already in progress as long as they are passionate about its completion. Aquarius can help situate and resolve issues rather than jumping blindly into new ones, whereas Sagittarius is happy to drift from one subject to the next as the mood takes them. They are both loyal and devoted to one another, and they can get past a lot together.     What's the best aspect of the Sagittarius-Aquarius relationship? It's their ability to resolve difficult issues when they put their hearts in the matter.

Their formidable combination makes theirs a relationship of outward motion as well as inward depth.          Just be yourself!

But I've recently come across some rather startling revelations that show that astrology is even more absurd than I thought:     My birthday is December 1, so I'm considered a Sagittarius according to astrology. Except...I'm not. Astrology is based on which constellation the sun is in on the day you're born, and tradition states I was born under Sagittarius, the archer. But I was actually born under Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer. What the hell is that? you might ask. Well, it's a constellation the sun passes through each December, which supposedly looks like a guy holding a serpent or something (it doesn't to me, but that's a whole nother rant). Traditional astrology holds that there are 12 constellations in the zodiac (the zodiac is the belt of the sky the sun, moon, and all the planets minus pluto, travel through), but according to astronomers there are actually 13*: Ophiuchus is the neglected one. (It's pronounced ah-fee-YOO-kus, and it's named after the Greek god of healing Asclepius, who liked to hold snakes.)     Basically, traditional astrology is wrong astronomically on two counts:     1) The Babylonians divided the zodiac into 12 equal sections of 30 degrees even though there were 13 constellations and the constellations were different sizes and took up different proportions of the circle. So even back 2,000 years ago when the system was created, not everyone was actually born under the constellation they were supposed to have been born under.     2) The Earth does what's called a precession (sort of like a wobble) that is repeated every 25,800 years. The precession changes the direction the Earth's axis points, which changes which stars appear where in the sky; right now, Polaris is the pole star, but in 12,000 years, Vega will be the pole star. Astrology is old enough that the stars have noticiably altered in their positions since it was developed. Thus, the whole system is about two weeks off by virtue of that alone.     Add together these two things, and a whopping 86% of us** weren't actually born under the constellation asigned to us by astrology. Eighty-six percent! And about 5% of us (including me) were born under a constellation that most people have never even heard of. Check out the table below and see if you're actually the sign astrology claims. The dates fluctuate from year to year, but this is generally the case:       The actual dates for the zodiac: Sagittarius   December 18 - January 18   Capricornus   January 19 - February 15   Aquarius   February 16 - March 11   Pisces   March 12 - April 18   Aries   April 19 - May 13   Taurus   May 14 - June 19   Gemini   June 20 - July 20   Cancer   July 21 - August 9   Leo   August 10 - September 15   Virgo   September 16 - October 30   Libra   October 31 - November 22   Scorpius   November 23 - November 29   Ophiuchus   November 30 - December 17     That's why astrology is bunk astronomically. But there are also some compelling reasons why astrology is bunk anyway.     First of all, the idea that all people born between two dates have the same personality characteristics is just insane. I've known plenty of other supposed Sagittarii, most of whom were all very different from me (and had different things happen to them every day). And I am most definitely not the traits generally listed for Sags: "philosophic, fun-loving, adventurous, blundering, wanderlust, scattered", according to Wikipedia. I am very philosophic, but not really any of the other things. So that's one out of six. And anyway, there are traits in all the signs that could apply to me. I'm saturnine (Capricorn), cause-oriented (Aquarius), spiritual (Pisces), artistic (Pisces), selfish (Aries), musical (Taurus), curious (Gemini), intelligent (Gemini, Virgo), lazy (Libra), passionate (Leo), creative (Leo), and obsessive (Scorpio). I know there are people out there who believe completely in astrology because they think they match their sign perfectly. And statistically there would have to be a handful who match perfectly. But anyone can find ways in which their sign applies to them. The sign that astrology attaches to you is the one you'll look at the most carefully, and seek out truth from. But it's just as easy to find your personality elsewhere in the zodiac, and since 86% of us weren't born under our sign, we are actually looking elsewhere. (So keep that in mind if you've always thought your compulsive personality was a reflection of your Scorpio sign: it's impossible to be a Scorpio both astronomically and astrologically, so your compulsiveness is probably just a result of your biology or environment.)     Second of all, many of the character traits were made up because they matched the shape of the constellation. For instance, Aries are considered "head-strong" because that constellation supposedly looks like a ram, an animal that's head-strong. But why should the shape mean anything? The stars aren't actually arranged that way, it's just the way they appear from Earth. Why should the particular arrangement of the stars from the perspective of Earth have any bearing on the personalities or daily lives of people born while the sun was between the Earth and those stars? Furthermore, that's just the arbitrary shape assigned by the Babylonians thousands of years ago; another culture might see it as something entirely different.     In conclusion: astrology is bunk. Offended by my extremely rational declaration? Feel free to respond. It'll be amusing. (And I reserve the right to post any absurd claims made about astrology's veracity.)     * Thirteen is the standard number agreed upon by the International Astronomical Union.

AA11064241	Hi try out the website i've entered in the resource list... it gives free piano music and may help.  other than that try a google search.  I'm a qualified music teacher and also teach Violin and Piano privately so have loads of resources and stuff that i can't attach... d'oh!    Try Wikipedia.com or answers.com too and a google search may provide some useful stuff.    Search treble clef or reading the treble clef as a start.    Notes resting on the lines of stave read EGBDF (Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge) and in between the lines read FACE.    Due to the fact the musical notes only read A-G you can usually count through the letters of the notes.  It is quite common to go down to G in the treble clef, sometimes F (3 Ledger lines below) but usually Bass clef is more common F and below.    Hope this helps|`|5ZIJL2eMaa	Not sure what you mean but I think this website may be of use.    Hope it helps!|`|66406325e659a84a5720793c6a6301caaa	i dont understand this question..... ledger lines are the things that go under the stave. in the treble clef the first ledger line after the bottom of the stave is middle c.... if u wanna make a diagram just draw it out and lable them down wards... c,b,a,g,f,e,d. C, A, F, D- should be on the lines. but too be fair, if your that low, u may as well use the bass clef.

This is a technical question and u need more explanation. The same way as in dubbing the scenes in the studio after the editing, songs are played at the location using a NAGRA recorder and the artist hears it and acts generating a feeling that he actually sings. That is the reality. Film-making is a really wonderfull subject.. Please read books in this subject and you will be more interested to know how films are made and their technical implementations.|`|e87f1c407f4d2389ce889a2002cff8d3aa	I thin he was singing, but as you say, it was prerecorded.

db1b305dd463fe271daac503e9370737aa	I'm fairly certain that 'The Straun House' falls into that category of movies that are based on a true story where as the true story is simply of a person somewhere at some time was in an asylum.    There are way too many movies out like that, the producers take a bit too much leeway with 'Based on True Events!' or 'Loosely based on a true story' They even use the same tactics to promote the latest Chainsaw movie, where all of those events are based around Eddie Gein's horrific acts. But at no point did he live with his crazy relatives and run around screaming with a chainsaw.

Eu prefiro mil vezes que ele ven?a, embora em alguns momentos tenha sido sim esnobe, mas fazer o qu?    "Os outros" tanto brindaram pela desarmonia da casa que foram saindo um por um e a sua amiga Carol s ficou l porque viu no final do segundo tempo que se ela n?o mudasse de atitude seria capaz de perder para o falso do Airton!

Only close answer I could get thru researching was "Peril-Sensitive Sunglasses".. Otherwise, no dice.  Maybe the answer is in a cast/crew log, or blogger of / on the film.

Adems le dicen que se est calentito y que la esperan para el viernes.  Vamos, que la viuda cree que se va a ir con el marido el viernes.  "Abajo", quiere decir para los de Madrid un lugar en la playa, a menos altitud que su ciudad.  Adems, si no, el chiste no tendra gracia. No podra confundirse el infierno con la estancia en la playa y el e-mail equivocado.  Muy buen chiste.|`|pNZ5wvCnaa	Creo que lo de "aqu abajo" est sobrando... Ms bien debera ser "hace un calor tremendo por estos lares"...

Quitarse los zapatos antes de entrar.  2. Subir tratando de no hacer ruido.  3. Quitarse la ropa en el ba?o con la luz apagada.  4. Entrar en el cuarto bien despacito.  Resultado: De igual manera la mujer se va a emputar y se levanta a cantaletear y a joder la vida.    Metodo Correcto:    1. Llegar sonando las llantas del carro, dando frenadas bruscas.  2. Tirar la puerta con fuerza.  3. Subir la escalera pisando fuerte.  4. Quitarse la ropa y los zapatos y tirar todo.  5. Batir la puerta del armario.  6.

Con solo mirar un mapa se hubieran dado cuenta.  PD El chiste est muy bueno  Jajajajajaja  :)

They sat in the seat behind me.  it would've been a pain to tell them which numbers they were pressing.|`|m8QynXOiaa	because drive through ATMs are no different than other ATMs... they are all made the same way, so they have to put braille on the walk up ATMs so they also put them on the Drive Up ones...|`|8JOAIWGTaa	I see what you're trying to ask- If you're blind then you wouldn't be driving and hence would not need to read the Braille on the drive through ATM.  Some blind people have drivers so if they wanted to use the ATM the driver ensures that they are on the left side of the car and pulls up to the blind person's window.  Also many drive up ATM's double as a walk up ATM for people in a rush.  That is another situation where a blind person would use the drive up ATM.

BBjGaAtraa	In resent episodes the possibility pretty mutch just come down to:  ROCK  WATER  LIGHTNING   GHOST   PHICIC  FIGHT i think that's what its called  ICE but it just another Water thing  FIRE  then all of then have there own special list of ability's   If your talking about a person then this might just be useless  If your talking about Super Mario Bros Brawl then the Pokemon Trainer has three Pokemon the Iveasoar sqirtile and charzard  I think i right but if not then I'm am vary forget full.    Source: I'm a Ex Pokemon fan!|`|6rR7LTl1aa	Pokeman?    Well, obviously he's exceptionally skilled at poking things.    Pokemon, on the other hand...|`|Y6xanshEaa	Pokeman?  Well,he has the superpower to poke stuff..Alot!    Now Pokemon.  Super powers?    Well,they have multiple "types",17 to date actually.  Normal,fighting,flying,poison,ground,r... and dark.    Alot of Pokemon have 2 types,types can be mixed and matched.  For example,Charizard is a fire-flying type Pokemon,and Bibarel is a Normal-Water type.    Pokemon also have "abilities",but those are different.  They're traits that help them in battle,such as "Run Away" which helps them escape quicker in battle,"Cute Charm" which may make a Pokemon of the opposite gender fall in love with it,or "Damp" which prevents the foe from self destructing.    Pokemon attacks follow the 17 types too,except for the "???" type.  "Curse" is the only move with a "???". However,shadow moves from the Gamecube console rpg games have the "???" type.    Only glitch Pokemon can have this type(???) as their type|`|JbDfdJb8aa	The abilities depend entirely on the Pokemon. There were so many species introduced the list of their powers is quite long.    However, most of the Pokemons' abilities are based on elemental properties (i.e. fire).|`|tVUCbN5Jaa	Their attacks depend on their type. Fire pokemon can spit out fire using Ember or Flamethrower. Electric pokemon can use Thunderbolt. The list goes on. The pokemon's type determines what attacks it can use. Some can only use 1 or 2 different moves. Like, Ditto and Magikarp.|`|oDGttkmLaa	is this a trick question Kenny?

a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	you forgot KRS (even Dre sampled his vocals, Kweli and Mos Def are always making songs that parallel his, and an entire 2 subgenres owe him homage, Hardcore hip-hop and it's successor, Gangsta Rap) and JMJ (mentored 50)    how new is the new school?  We talking "License to Ill" new school or since 2000?  If it's just since 1990, then Wu-Tang Clan. RZA's beats were imitated ad naseum, the lyrical style, the content, the diversification (clothing, videogame. . .), the image. . .    Kool Keith seems to have started another subgenre all together    Since 2000?  Soulja Boy seems to be pissing off enough people that a new wave of hardcore, gritty, grimy, albums might be on the way.    too many rappers seem to be on Lil Wayne's di*k    Blue Sky Black Death are doing something I could see others try to imitate|`|zVdNQowNaa	New New School or just New school?    New New School:  Lupe Fiasco  Eminem  Mos Def  Talib Kweli  DMX    New School:  2Pac  Biggie  Nas   Jay-Z  Big L  Big Punisher  Common  AZ  Ice Cube    I consider 90s and 00s to be New School and 80s old school.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	The Big 4- Biggie, Pac, Jay-Z, and Nas.|`|DDmFQU7raa	Lil' Wayne is going to be the most influential of everyone out now. Although it's not what us old hip hop heads enjoy, his style is catching fire, and rappers realize that this is the best way to succeed and make money.    Oh, I forgot Kanye West. I wouldn't be surprised if most rappers get more in touch with their feminitity thanks to Kanye. I'm not joking! Kanye has made metrosexuality an in-thing in hip hop.|`|lMOXHh45aa	I actually do have to say Pac... Pac wasn't a pioneer??? Pioneering has nothin to do with your talent, it's all about your impact... Pac set the mold for *ALOT* of rappers out today, and that might be good or bad depending on your perception but eitherway it's really doesn't matter... that's not impact though?- what??? lol|`|jvX36ryyaa	i think and hope that lupe is going to influence a new generation as well as jay-z, nas, eminem, and common|`|AA11262337	there won't be any one beyond the greats of today...Battle MC's jay-z, Nas, great story tellers like B-I-G also a battle rapper. The truth about hip -hop in the future is that it will turn into something of what Jazz was in it infancy. It was great until Kenny G and those types touched it and that where we are now at a cross road trying to keep Hip- Hop in its essence.     With progress come Digress it whom put the pen or cil to the pad shall reveal the past. Great ones resurfaces but new one will alway rehearse it. Paint a picture so graphic that it out of character. Hip-hop we hold her so tight but we fear her plight. The hood calls her home now she is in everyones home. confuse and battered she is abused domestically  she can also be profitably yours but neva eva eva a whore...leave her alone she can grow on her own but you can neva call her your own. the streets,poverty,love and hate gave birth to her now we negate her, my love I call her HIP-HOP what do you call her? old school new school she will always be my BOO. so when they put me under she will continue to ring, your words your sound and your plight. HIP HOP I will miss you.    BROOKLYN STAND UP. EAST FLATBUSH|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Its hard to say because so many new generation listeners are caught up in the club scene/ring tone rap scene.  I think Eminem, Nas, and Jay Z have def left their mark on the game and in the culture of the music.  You can hear their styles in alot of the newer talent.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	i hate to say none but i think now most rappers just want their money and will bite off what ever style is hot at the time so who ever starts something hot will be influential until something new comes out and it it'll just keep going and going like follow the leader or follow the money|`|vFj2GMP4aa	I think Nas, Jay Z, Biggie and unfortunately thanks to the Media and some mindless individuals, 2pac.

lkNJNnlSaa	you need a certain percentage in a specific topic, the exact % i'm not too sure of.    I woke up last week and found out i was a top contributor in a subject i hardly ever answer.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	I would say it is about 10% best answers.  My TC just appeared last week and I just happened to be answering a lot of questions in the Yahoo Answers category.  I did not get best answers for any of them I just answered a lot of questions.  I was already up to a level 5 when I got the TC badge. I spent a lot of time in Polls & Surveys and you do not get a TC badge for that section no matter how many questions you answer.  I hope that this is correct I can only tell you what happened to me.  One of the other answerer's might be able to fill you in with more details.|`|IizPFrELaa	Well for P&S you will never see a TC badge, answer lots of questions in other cat's    Sheila's right you don't need any BA's to get the TC badge, just lots and lots of answers in any category other than P&S or J&R (jokes and riddles)|`|ym04vDkcaa	you need 10% best answers for 1 particular section (cant be done for p&s for some dum reason) and you either need to be on lvl 3 or 4|`|g06DsmgTaa	100% percent, you have to spend the rest of your life answering questions in that section    that's the sacrifice you have to make|`|70OHpjySaa	I'm a TC and I have no idea.  The thing just pops up and it's a nice surprise.    But I don't think it's about percentage. I have only 16% of Best Answers so it's not much but it's really about 550 Best Answers over all. I answer a lot of questions just for fun in P&S for example, but my TC is about answering more seriously in Diet and Fitness.    You cannot have TC in P&S but if you concentrate on one category for a while, you'll eventually get TC in that one. It doesn't take long. You can also lose your TC if you stop answering there.      Here's what Y/A is saying about it...    A Top Contributor is a member of the Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a particular category. Each Answers user can be a top contributor in up to three categories.     The top contributor badge is dynamic you earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a particular category. The more actively you contribute, the more likely you will earn a badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to feature community members who might otherwise be overlooked.|`|AA12116854	I asked a similar question and was informed that you need to have a large percentage (unknown number) in ONE particular category. You can however, be a top contributor in several categories but you cannot be a top contributor if you're answers are in all categories instead of one, two, etc.  Make sense?
C9vcHbnVaa	I am both a Christian and a Mj fan. but remember what 1 John, 2:3-7 said," We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. The man who says, " I know him (God)", but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But if any one obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did." Even though people say they love God and Jesus, but if they don't obey Jesus commands, same thing to God because they are both one, then the Bible calls those people liars.|`|mlXnsofGaa	Yes I am I have been Christian all my life( 3years ago I went to a christian school for 2 years)And I am totally an MJ fan9as you can tell by myY!A name. God bless you and Michael|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	I am both! and proud!|`|KdCzS5Q4aa	I am Christian and am a Michael Jackson fan!  C'mon, his music is legendary! I don't know a single person who doesn't love Michael Jackson's music!|`|FRKCrLNSaa	I am a Christian, I'm not a big, big fan of Michael Jackson and I won't be nasty to you or Michael. I think his songs are really great, my favourite is either Black or white, Bad or Thriller. I'm not a religious Christian but I am one.  Mj rocks!|`|ajPHMliqaa	but hes a paedophile..........i understand people liking his music  but lets not talk about what a wonderful person he is|`|Wlc7wNlHaa	my family and I are christians and my brother used to dance and try to the moon walk w/ michael jackson, but then again...that was 8 years ago.....and he doesnt listen to him anymore :/|`|gGZz2EGyaa	I am a christian and  I like Micheal Jackson.  I would not say that I was a great fan, but I do like to hear him sing but I would not go to see his live shows.  I think he has recorded some good songs and I like to hear his records.|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	Michael Jacksons a friggin ledgend|`|fouEsSofaa	You won't get anything nasty from me.  Love him. And I don't care what anyone says. LONG LIVE THE KING OF POP!|`|df078ac8fd8225dafd12204f9bf294dfaa	I like MJ......love the Thriller album.....and I'm a Christian....but what has that got to do with anything.....MJ has issues....big time issues...but he was a great entertainer and made some pretty dang good music......I dont get what being a christian has to do with it....|`|GCl84SPLaa	He is eccentric. His music is great and he is a big talent. I am a Christian and I have always enjoyed him. He settled out of court to avoid bigger problems, but was he ever convicted of pedophilia, or was there ever any real evidence, or was the media just buying in to the words of families that wanted to make a quick buck? Yes, he slept with those kids, but did he ever actually make advances on them? And why did the parents allow those kids to sleep there anyhow?    The only thing I see him guilty of is poor judgment. I am a Christian, and I am a fan, and I will hold this opinion until someone proves me wrong.|`|ZeKnInbjaa	I am! and didn't you know that the haters were going to jump all over this? haha...I don't even get shocked anymore...It is a pain though. anyway yes, I'm a Christian and I love Michael. I've followed his career for many years and I love him and there is nothing or no one who could stop that! I love Jesus and have followed him all of my life and nothing or no one could stop that either...If someone doesn't know Jesus it's very hard for them to understand those of us who do so they come up with their own explanations. It's very similar with Michael...I mean, he's not Jesus, but people exploited him and tried to crucify him also for the good he did and they told horrible lies on him. his loyal fans love him and back him. take care...(:)|`|HXpOui7gaa	Yes & Yes :)  And i am proud to be both!   I have always been a christian, but never a practising one. I barely go to church, but since being a michael jackson fan, that has all changed it for me. I started going to church again, and i startd praying for him when he had court cases and 'rough' times. I think it helped.   I am well proud to say i am a christian that prays for her beloved michael Jackson lol.  Love you, best friend xxx :)|`|xqhSoNylaa	Me  I LOVE Jesus   & as u mae kno I luv MJ ;D  yea I find the titles of Bad, Dirty Diana, Smooth Criminal and Dangerous somewhat questionable, but I believe that those are only songs that don't represent who MJ really is.  I think errything that he duz for society is God-fearing, and that we were meant to do many of the thing that Jackson has already.|`|IHUS8wsbaa	BAD ERA FAN IS A CHRISTIAN  cause my god is an awesome god.|`|gq2te5pSaa	Yeah, I think religious people like him because they see how good, pure and holy he is.|`|85dfce96a83fdb7b5c93892243941847aa	I'm a Christian, but not a religous one and Micheal Jackson is my childhood hero.  But one of my Hostel Master at my old Boardin School preached against him, and one in my first boarding school(he's was late then, may he R.I.P) said he's song 'Bad' was against god(because it talks about him being 'Bad') but songs like 'Heal the World' is OK|`|efQ0hac1aa	I'm a huge fan, but not a Christian.|`|eHUXcYZhaa	I'm not a Christian and I'm certainly not a Michael Jackson fan. You are deluded if you think he is not a paedophile.|`|AA10964483	I am Christian and a MJ fan!!! Love being both!|`|aoQppGSQaa	Yes! I'm a Christian, and I'm a huge fan of Michael of course!!!  He is the only in having conquered my heart, he's my angel and I will be forever his!  Hurts me to see people who believe with conviction to everything that to say the tabloids, stupid, rude and false and judge him without know who he is and the true..they see only what they want to see and don't understand that they are very stupid..the prejudice is ignorance  Michael is innocent and we know it, and even if we try to make them the truth, they don't want to see and continue to think their stupid things..this is pathetic..  And I can tell you that here in Italy the majority of people are Christians, it's difficult find a person that he is of an other religion lol!!!    KING OF POP STAY ON TOP|`|HURcAIu2aa	yes im a proud christian and a proud michael jackson fan =]  i love jesus,god,family,friend,MJ|`|CW5rnThOaa	ME! I am a Proud MJ fan and a Proud *very active* Catholic!  I think that one of the reasons that I love Michael so much is his Christian values. Even if he is not a Christian any more, he thinks the way that Christians think and has some of the qualities that many Christians strive for and are never able to obtain *his great love for everyone, his want for peace, his humility and humbleness, etc.* . Michael is a great role model and has a heart of gold; that's why I love him :)

It takes about 30m to walk there normally but it's down backstreets where the snow's got no chance of clearing so I'll have to walk extremely slowly or go a very long way round, which is probably going to take at least an hour and seems a bit pointless when I'll only be at uni for that long.

So then why does Islamic radicalism train & employ terrorists?    ...& it just so happens that some spread the love by blowing up the innocent thru acts of terrorism...   Which is greatly practiced by the very descendants of the author of the religion, who've been taught the Jihad from generation to generation...  Those who know & understand the Qu'ran the most understand it  to tell them to kill the innocent infidels... (of course they'd argue that infidels aren't innocent, because they don't follow their views of the Qu'ran... so I guess if you agree, then you'll agree with this statement he made.)    while others spread the love by funding abortions (who ever heard of an innocent baby? Those heathen.)...    & others by living & dieing within the laws as much as possible, while sharing what little the Lord provides them of their goods.    So, just different ways of showing love, & different views on which lives are innocent, I guess?    Or perhaps the key is in the words, "central tenant"    I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt, & say he meant that the religions as he understands them can be peaceful...  Can there be peaceful Islamists? (Even though it is the only religion which claims it will take over the world some day & then the end will come & Alla will come to reward them... In other words they will take over the world by any means necessary & infidels & other religions their lives are in no way protected under the Qu'ran... )    Islam has always been a dangerous & volatile religion & it will always be a dangerous & volatile religion, simply because of the dynamic volitilities embedded into it's core source, the Qu'ran...    I think it's time people are taught the threats of this source of current & hostile violent threat to all.|`|SahUDTLnaa	This man doesn't seem to know his B*** from a hole in the ground Much less knowing our God.

0cc7b69ea6b5f359aa006de2a67d9086aa	Funny Story, I was in a red neck bar in the early 90's (Eh...In Georgia there are alot of redneck bars. :-)) Anyway, I was drinking a beer and looking around and the jukebox was playing some country tunes.  So I walked over to play a couple of songs.  Flipping through the songs I was surprised to find George Michael's "Teacher".  Or course, I immediately realized this song should never be played in a redneck bar.  That's when I selected it and sat at the extreme end of the bar to wait for it's play and witness the shenanigans. :-)|`|DnWsMhwLaa	pop isn't a genre. it is meant to imply anything mainstream, accessible or popular regardless of genre.     i dont think there are any genres that are inherently bad, only bad musicians.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Scuse Me while I take a beating but... I have never ever seen how Grunge is superior to Hair Metal in any way whatsoever. And the fact that People say it is as important a genre as Heavy Metal or Jazz is laughable frankly. I like Grunge and all but to Me that's just unrealistic.    Also Punk, I can understand why it is ranked as high as it is, and I agree but Personally being a Prog and Metalhead the Genres as so diametrically opposed to each other, well, I just can't get much into it. And to anyone that would say it was more imporatnat than Metal or Prog I'd have to disagree.    Btw, Freedom is the only George Micheal song I ever liked overmuch.|`|cVqCryr6aa	Oh, yes! I wait for him in public restrooms every night!|`|8jd2AHJdaa	Yes I am a George Michael fan and I think his best song is the cool "Father Figure"|`|7fEVNng5aa	Actually, I'm a casual fan of George Michael. But that's not the question, is it? :)    Country. I find most of it, not all of it, but most of it, to be very bland. It's uninspired music with cookie cutter lyrics.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Hey I like George Michael.  He doesn't quite dominate my playlist but hes there lol.    I think grunge is way overrated.  They couldn't really pick a better word for that genre, because it really is grungy.  The lyrics are depressing, the instrumentals are faily bad, and the vocals are more or less non existent.  I have no idea what draws people to it, but people love it.  I for one could do without it.|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	Actually, I thought Listen Without Prejudice, Vol. 1 was outstanding.  In fact, a lot his solo work was great.    And I honestly don't know what the most overrated genre is.  Current Pop music does leave a lot to be desired, though.    Edit:  That's awesome, Mr. B...LOL!|`|BLLdUrWVaa	yeah same here.|`|D657vcVsaa	the only george michael i like is the michael cera's character in arrested development: george michael bluth|`|RVAPQg6Waa	George Michael fans? no they're all in the bathroom (bada bing) I'll be here all week folks...      overrated genre? can't think of a genre per say, I'd say Emo/Guyliner bands are over disscussed though...|`|uGFzzLYWaa	The only 2 GM songs I like are "Freedom" and "Praying for Time."    I find pop music to be overrated as well. For the last year or so, I find that it all kind of sounds the same to me, annoying and synthetic. Nothing really hooks into me anymore. It's almost like they're running out of ideas for music.|`|XWRxRWVkaa	pop music will always be overrated it's "POPular" music,  regardless if its any good.  that is the basis of the genre.  BUILT TO SELL|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Hahaha! I didn't mind "Faith" back in the day.     People who are into grindcore think it's the greatest thing in the world, but I have to admit, I don't get it. It's all just a bunch of tuned-down loud guitars, ridiculously fast beats, and indecipherable growls. I can't pick out lyrics, keys, melodies, chord progressions, anything. It all just sounds like a bunch of mush. One group sounds exactly like another.    I usually end up laughing at the blast beats that are supposed to be so "brutal." What's so impressive about a drumbeat that sounds like a slot machine paying out?

a1Ngi39Xaa	I strongly suggest the Young and The Restless.  I have been watching it since I was about 12 (on and off).  I am 45 now.  It's a great show - lots of history and it's really good right now.  Also lots of people on Yahoo Answers watch it and can answer any questions you have!  Lots of them are also loyal fans of As The World Turns.    I also watch The Bold and The Beautiful - it is on right after Young and The Restless.  It's only a half hour long and some of the storylines right now are a little lame, but it's still worth watching.    I had stopped watching As The World Turns for awhile, and The Guiding Light for a long while.  But they are both getting really good now again as well.      I like the entire CBS lineup, personally.|`|lLcUnw4maa	EASTENDERS!!!!!!!|`|DkVofG9paa	DAYS OF OUR LIVES.  channel 5.  been watching it for 15 years.|`|RF52FRdyaa	General Hospital|`|lTmrWBRlaa	Eastenders.

Take for example mashed potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, peas.  Add a portion of beef pie.  Just piled on the plate they are a good meal.  However, set out differently, they are a better meal.  Potatoes piped onto the plate.  Vegetables neatly arranged picturesquely, the meat pie as a centerpiece.  It looks better and to your mind it tastes better.  The same with a book.  Whether it be paperback or hard cover, the story is still the same.  The only thing different is the price.  A final example is a flame effect electric fire.  The room may not be really warm, but just the sight of those flickering artificial flames makes you feel comfortable.  Just as your triangle sandwiches seem to taste better than their rectangle cousins.|`|aIzKbpQGaa	both taste the same but triangular shape is more tempting and therefore adds to appetite|`|jst2TfUXaa	thats actually a really good question.  i think that it is because the thought of a different shape makes your brain think that they'll have a different taste because they look different than normal.|`|NH5htkAyaa	i have noo idea but its true lol|`|JOAPnhOgaa	its something to do with their cutting edge :))|`|5rraSJRVaa	You're right... Maybe because I like biting on the sharp pointy edges of the triangle (:|`|8phMfVERaa	It's called 'presentation'.|`|hf6UbyUxaa	Because you taste directly the taste of food in it... and it also look nicer than the rectangle one...|`|BMYOukx5aa	Because Their rectangle cousins are boring and triangles are funner to eat|`|69b91f42927e8e3de27734e3a92e06f6aa	You are absolutely right! I was even telling my daughter this the other day - triangles do seem to look and taste better.|`|0R5gf3Abaa	cos they look nicer|`|d7MsDvrmaa	Because you can get to the middle faster and that is where are the GOD filled goodness is located. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.|`|t5NjDHoTaa	I'm not sure, but there's something wonderful about them!|`|oSfXwfnfaa	they look better and so somehow taste better.hmm, i only noticed this now! here's a star!|`|AA11152480	wow  amazing !|`|BBVfRheyaa	I don't think so.|`|p0c4mek6aa	I've always wondered that.

8dPjbSLyaa	i am the same way. i get so embarrased. thats why i like to watch movies by myself. i watched last holiday last night with my friend last night and cried through half the movie. i cry in almost every movie i see, even cartoon movies.  i cry when a sad part comes on or when a really happy part comes on.|`|XJFkcjUmaa	crying for any reason is a sign of sensitivity not weakness. having said that, some people are more emotional than others, it depends on your history and back ground. not to get personal but if lets say your parents, or just plain parent, are very kind hearted and open to others needs, you may have inherited that and it is just exposed, for now through emotional parts in films. it is also a known fact that movies are used to take you to emotional places through fantasy, that's the mark of a good directer. Either way your fine, some people just control it better than others.|`|4sW77bqtaa	its normal to cry in movies even if they really don't mean anything its normal guys cry sometimes too and um there is no reason to feel embarrassed at all|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Only two movies ever made me cry.

Well I had to go to the can after a bit. I couldn't believe how filthy that place was. I couldn't even pee in there. I wanted to throw my shoes away after just walking into the place. And the stink!

One of the toilets had been "used " so many times the waste was piled up, and they had used cardboard for toilet paper and to top it all off, the toilet had large roaches living in all the waste and paper,  there was no running water in the house so I had to clean, scoop, clean, scoop with buckets of water from a water hose attatched to a water faucet next door|`|mwv79AIhaa	last party bustrip to vegas...the seat was real low..almost on the floor and i think there was more vomit around than fecus....eww, and then a lil tree airfreshener hanging that i almost had to roll up and stick up my nose just to hang my wanker out to pee.|`|lCvKauNEaa	public restrooms.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	I was at K-Mart.

ynk7hWjGaa	Hey there    Nope I have not been in there - nor have I ever been to NYC    But i AM a HUGE fan of Miss Liberty!    i am the only member of the Statue of Liberty Club that lives in the UK  I did book my flights a few days ago to go visit her in October and also in time for the Club convention.    Unfortunatly as of 9/11/01  the crown and the stairs leading up to it were closed, and the highest point of access for the public was and still is the highest level of the pedestal, directly below Miss Libertys feet.    It makes me laugh how some of the answers here have said they went into the Torch!  -  The Torch has been closed off to the public since 1916!!!  So unless we have 100 year old internet surfers who went upto the torch at age 5....      People love to lie to try and make themselves sound interesting!!    Anyway back to the question...   Barack Obama is campaigning to get Miss Libertys crown back open to the public.  The national park service are doing an evaluation on whether this can be possible, and they will have the answer for us by April.  Ireally hope they will re open it... even better if its by the time I visit!    http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Par...|`|tXXie5yqaa	no........................hows your daughter?|`|qq804CE8aa	I was at the Statue of Liberty a few years ago.

ucQxe2e4aa	Yes, Black and Norse metal usually do deal with actually being satanic, but not all the genres, bands and/or musicians themselves are.    Some (most) just talking about murdering, death, suicide, and violent themes. It is intended to sound evil, nothing like that could possibly be about puppies or butterflies.  But there are Atheists in the metal world who just pull largely from Satanic themes, and use dramatic lyrics (like you can hear them anyways) and intense riffs to essentially be like the musical equivalent of a scary movie.

Have You ever listened to their song "After Forever"? They lyrics are quite pro-christian..    Can't toss every band in a Genre under one blanket.|`|AA10652867	I wouldn't label such bands "satanists", just anti-christ. They reject the present religion in all foms or just the ideas of organized religionn. Many of these bands focus a lot and are influenced on Paganism, mythology, and of course, some have that touch of death in them. As for the bands sounding "evil", it's really a point of view and it depends on what one is used to listening. If you get someone who listens to hip-hop/rap music to get a load of Arch Enemy, I wouldn't be surprised if they thought it to be Satanic.|`|0vm66wlcaa	I'm not sure about all, but a lot of Black Metal bands seem to have dark, satanic beliefs. Especially in Norway :P    Doom Metal bands tend to have depressing lyrics about being sad and alone.    It's kind of stereotypical tha all metal bands are satanic.    I'm not one who looks into lyrics much. I am a guitarist, so I usually focus on the instrument parts rather than lyrics.|`|JaDWlil7aa	they do this because there are alot of fans out there who love and live by that kind of music. i am one of them. the music gets you pumped, and its what some people preffer(sp?). not everyone has to like it and not everyone does. but most of them are not satanists. there are some out there but most of them arent. that is just how they express themselves|`|XWRxRWVkaa	rent:  HEAVY METAL, A HEADBANGERS JOURNEY.    it will awnser most if not all of your ?'s    Tom Araya had an interesting quote...

PpaaRkm9aa	Actually, yes i have seen it before. It's a solid B-grade horror movie. Haven't seen it in a long time, but the gore and such is moderate compared to newer films. It's really more of a suspense/thriller than a straight-up horror movie. The movie should be appropriate for teens and up.|`|Kaj4WqPjaa	Yes i have  It's ok  No not at all  15    Your welcome
b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	This was *awesome*, PJ.  Wow...I'm glad you re-posted this.    The writing process is so different for everyone and it was fascinating to see how these musicians came together, collaborated and created a musical painting from their own pallette.  And I saw it the same as Tanya...they were bringing her home to life and that was very, very cool.    Dog sledding would be wild, that's for sure!|`|5HvdcWvBaa	A star *and* an answer?? Must be your lucky day ;)    I liked it actually, at first i was a bit like "woah, huh?" but it grew on me somewhat, its pretty interesting.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	i'll listen later and edit. it sounds interesting from that description.    edit: that was really interesting... i love it when people arent afraid to just try stuff and go nuts, it is really inspiring, sometimes it would start to feel a little, whats the word, flakey and too new agey, but then they would just do something really interesting that would draw me back in and get me thinking about the possibilities of sound and music. thanks.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Hey man!    Well at first I thought that female vocalist has a little influence form  William Peter Blatty, Linda Blair and The Exorcist film especially in the scene when shes in her room going "Fu** Me Fu** Me Fu** Me Fu** Me Fu** Me" and stabbing her crotch with the crucifix. Also some definite Satan Possession Influence hands down.    However as I continued to watch that String Singing there is some Definite technique there that I can appreciate. Thanks for sharing.    EDIT  Yeah I can see the Patton element there I didn't even think about that Patton has for sure sounded like Satan at times himself as well =P    sorry about the image factor I was laughing myself as I typed that in there just entertaining myself as always =P|`|iJzlRCkOaa	Wow... I've heard *of* Throat Singing before, but I've never actually heard it.  It's so distant and almost as if it's not of this world.  Beautiful stuff, though.  Somehow it's completely natural, but completely unnatural as well.  The color thing was also fascinating, because I have a mild case of synaesthesia (Google it), which associates words and some sounds to specific colors, patterns and textures.    EDIT:  Here's a link I just found to some wonderfully surreal and airy Inuit Throat Singing.  It's actually pretty catchy, in a weird way lol.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnGM0BlA9...  So trancey.|`|9vBuOZXxaa	retarded i don't get it. whats the big idea|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	yeah i watched that the last time round... pretty fascinating! i'd never  heard anything like it! i love the improvised vibe about it, the 'colour scheme' and the 'primal' feel of the vocalising... like it's tapped into something deep and almost primeval... very cool!

They are over paid, arrogant, little kids.|`|AA11656797	Yeah. Although I think he is a good actor I had a suspicion he was a bit of a twat, and it looks like I was right.|`|zLeeLVaEaa	YES!!!!!!!! It is so much harder to make a movie than act in it!!!!! He is rude and yes I have lost respect for him.|`|JPDxyTT3aa	omg.     Putra is kinda kinky.     Its freakin me out man.     And no.

Especially at Patrick Bateman. I also liked him in Batman.    Batman was ****, and only got those oscars becuase Heath ledger died. Can you imagine, 3 years ago someone telling you that 'batman' would recieve tons of oscar nominations and you believing them?|`|K1oOQqqVaa	I never had much reason to respect him to start with, so no.|`|wdxUb3moaa	No.... I luv a**holes!|`|rptP7ynpaa	lol i never had any  but he is a creeper now|`|CEKZsoFRaa	No, after all he is a person. They even defended him on the View saying that what happened wasn't professional and as an actor he was in a "concentration zone". You don't know what's really going on in his life, not all the cursing was called for but he's human.|`|frwlypDWaa	I'm waiting for him to say his words were taken out of context.     Temperamental artists of the world, unite!|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	No...Hes a human being...and he was under a shitload of pressure at the time...**** happens.|`|cgqgomawaa	no. he got angry, everyone gets angry.|`|Qih2hKqkaa	No, the cameraman @sshole deserved it!|`|ebaa7ca0b1b2e45ca08cf6fd5db01a30aa	no|`|3hjGkfOgaa	Never had any to begin with|`|6e05d4950ab061c199407e8181b34dbeaa	hes human like the rest of us.  just hes in the limelight.  I never believe what the media says. they say it to sell papers.     give the guy a break.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Why any fool would think that a "movie star" is even worth thinking about is beyond me.  I enjoy movies, but don't think about the actors.  I read good books, and don't stress about the authors...|`|nbn0OXplaa	Absolutely not. If anything I respect him more for being honest.

HAhm1TUoaa	I suppose my peers would class my taste in music as "weird" as well. I like contemporary classical music, particularly piano and cello. My absolute favourite composer is Einaudi. I think I have all of his sheet music now.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYRR8K4Ke...  This is my favourite one to play. It goes on forever and I can just forget everything. When I play some pieces I get this weird feeling in my chest, sort of tight and sad, like I want to cry, but insanely happy at the same time.  Maybe I'm just weird.  Another of my favourites:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2K7D-uMH...|`|BMYOukx5aa	The best of the 80's is what I love|`|ZYA0Rt7Haa	Modern, new, pop :)  Take That   Wooh 10th June can't wait|`|N3LVlVmnaa	why do you care , be yourself !|`|6uH8E9wNaa	Black Music is the best!

iE45z4GPaa	A terrorist attack could happen anywhere - not just on USA soil.  With the mentality of terrorists, the world is a target - for one reason or another.    I don't know what President Obama has done so far so that he and his Administration are responsible for any attacks currently being planned. Besides, let's face it.....any Administration "on the way out" will always attempt to "stir the pot" a bit, in an attempt to scare those who voted against them.    Everybody knows that '*****' have no brains - this proves it!!!|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	What kind of intelligence reports is he receiving anymore?

He hasn't even made any decisions. Cheaney is a moron. he should go shoot himself in the face this time.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	I Dont know what to think   In an interview two weeks after leaving office, former Vice President Dick Cheney predicted a "high probability" of a nuclear or biological attack in the next few years and said the Obama administrationwas too timid in approaching the "tough, mean, dirty, nasty business" of keeping the country safe from terrorists.    Cheney singled out President Barack Obama's decision to close the detention facility at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, and to ban coercive interrogation methods as changes in course that could make the country more vulnerable.|`|RugUki9qaa	He should be able to state his opinion without being chastised for it.|`|4TmN5Dohaa	he is only trying to warn the public|`|JvsFHyw4aa	He's must be taking over for Karl Rove.|`|EVYSvkIraa	survey says:     its going to be cheney thats going to be attacking.   unless he was referring to when he shot that guy in the face... that couldve been a terrorist attack and its the new administrations fault cause they werent around to prevent it!     i have figured out the governments secrets!|`|AA12255473	If he's right, then you liberals ought to be thankful for the warning.

You Rule!!    I on the other hand have been trying to get rid of my badge for the last 7 months I have even switched accounts several times and after a week or 2 low and behold there's that annoying lame @ss loud orange badge again =(    Edit    No snow here its in the mid 80s out side here after all this is Phoenix AKA Hell Arizona lol. where its no less than 100Dgrs from late may to mid September.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	no, have never been and it's nothing I aspire too.

Lol, I don't know any song I could dedicate right now    Yeah, early morning snow.|`|cbZdeOSPaa	Sorry about that Lucy :( Unfortunately I have never been a TC so I don't know what it feels like to have it or to have it snatched away.    I don't really know if I want one, I used to desire to have one but ever since I heard that it can be taken away I actually changed my mind.     MQ: I can't think of any :( My brain ran away so I'm trying to get it back lol!    BQ: Nope! We didn't get any snow and I don't think we're getting any this week here in Texas.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Can't say I've had one taken away. It's just a badge, no big deal. You're still a TC in my book!

It's nice to have a little recognition and is not you being vain- I believe its an achievment thing- where you can look at your title and say "YEAH- I DO MY BIT".     If I were to dedicate a song- it would be "STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN" by Zep.- ITS PRETTY APT don't you think?     A record that has some awesome lyrics that not many people remember- is 'To be a man' by Kevin Wet.  the lyrics are very deep and really hold meaning for us all- not just for men.     Yes it's snowing.|`|M7E1uIsKaa	AWW! ...Why was your TC taken away?  You can have mine - it doesn't really make me feel too special anyways :/    Its wierd how they work...

I don't really prefer the badge, it seems like it just makes for one giant target on my back for the trolls to take aim at.  It is kind of cool I guess, but you get more good than bad.    MA: Its A Long Way To The Top - AC/DC    BA: No, but they are calling for some, I hope it stays away.|`|VaKhLMqxaa	Yes.  I had one in hair, since I'm a hairstylist and that's basically the only thing I know anything about on here. (except music :D)  I went like a day or two without answering in that category  and they took it away. -_-  I think it was even like, around thanksgiving time.  Like, okay...sorry I was celebrating a holiday. lol  I felt like something dear had been taken away from me.  haha  Although it's not that important.  Feels good to have one, though. lol  I can easily get it back.  It only took me like a week or two to get it.  But, yeah, big Troll target if you have one.|`|AA12301664	yes, but i don't think it was snatched away - i just didn't answer many questions for a couple of weeks.  it didn't take long to get it back, though.    a song for all my contacts:  half full glass of wine - tame impala  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zfcHq0hhFW...    ma: i built a snowman  :)|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	Evening!    Yes, I have been a TC around here before, but the badge never really stuck around for me.  I don't think Yahoo has ever given any clear definitions for TC status so I have no idea how people get or lose the badges.  They always disappeared for me when I got BAs in other sections.    BQ: No snow here today, but I hear it's on the way... :(|`|9RTuRPviaa	Actually i just got a TC badge today. Not so sure how i earned it but i'll go with it    bq: No snow yet where i am but i'm pretty sure we'll get it.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	i've had mine for a long time now. it was gone for one week after thanksgiving and i missed it. it is helpful for when you answer a  question that is going to get a lot of answers and you go back to that question later and you want to read the responses after yours, you can find yourself quicker. of course that is offset by being more visible to anyone trolling.|`|YA4qCDukaa	it might be nice ti be a tc but those badges are troll magnets...    mq: ffaf (lt gen. darling dan)  underoath ~ writing on the walls   http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=NRxbSLw-Ak...

I was busy with other things and wasn't playing on answers.yahoo for a while and before I knew it, my Top Contributor badge was gone.  It made me mad.  I spent all my free time answering questions until I got it back.  It took me 2 or 3 weeks to get it back.  I like having it.  It is my goal to overtake "Rckets" and become the Greatest Top Contributor in The World.    To "Rckets" Stormtrooper - Ted Nugent    No snow.  It's suppose to be in the 50's all week.

You're a curious person and love to learn, of course it has to be something that interests you otherwise you're ADD takes over.

Here we go: Sagittarians are fabulous of course.  Extremely independent and love to spend time alone..so much so   that they sometimes have a hard time bonding with others as they're  too busy travelling, painting, writing, dancing, designing, gardening,  singing, acting, or shooting around the universe at warp speed. They make their own fuel for their fire as they go and like a change  a minute, getting bored very easily if they have to repeat anything  twice. They're quite hedonistic but have a practical side when it  comes to functioning successfully in the world and are extremely  philosophical about challenging situations and tend to take the overview instead  of what I call The Undertoad. The minutia of life escapes them and  they like to indulge in the more soulful pursuits. They're usually  very funny, fast talking, fast thinking..in fact, so fast that a lot of  times they have to go back, regroup and start over. They love and  have to have beauty around them at all times...fresh flowers, dramatic  music, etc. They don't make the best off parents, but can be loving  with fire sign children.  Deep thinkers and heavily right brained, they  are smart, sexy, curious, irreverent, creative beings who should  always try to be around other fire signs that will understand them  perfectly. We rock!|`|EI3T4nMSaa	You love variety, and can be given to exaggerationnot because you are intentionally trying to mislead others, but because you have such an expansive vision in matters of the heart. Sometimes, as a result, you may promise more than you can give. You value spontaneity, and prefer to "wing it" when it comes to love. Planning ahead takes all the spice out of your life. You attract others with a free and easy attitude, and quickly become chummy with potential partners. You love to make people laugh, and your goofiness is generally considered attractive. A partnership that is too serious would drag you down. You are a dreamer, and have many visions.
y5dwVEK5aa	oh huny if you have to ask you got some growin up to do  dont care about what anyone else says about you just be who you are|`|U0KiOYQOaa	well it really matters about your other signs to.   go here and read about your chart   http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/a...|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Well, I am unique and original. In all honesty, I don't think I am like most people. I am creative and fun. I do enjoy talking. I love politics. I have a weird personality... I am distant and friendly, I can be cold and caring, I can be selfish and generous, I can be quiet and loud. I am fiercely independent and quirky. Unconventional. I love travel and culture. I would like to travel the world. I get distracted easily. I love to entertain. Sometimes I am quiet when I first meet someone, then I open up. I love to laugh.   On the dark side, I am bad tempered and jump to conclusions. I also don't take it well when friends ignore me for a long period of time. I can be defensive and b*tchy.    I am by no means a mean person. By nature, I am a nice, friendly, caring person.

tFIaFIn7aa	i am a former blink fan however i now listen to death metal. also i used to think travis barker amazing. that out of the way, i like your question because it biugs me as well when people talk about how phenomenal travis barker is and yet they don't mention so many other better drummers. I hate the Rev however i'd say he's much better than travis barker.     Whats nice about barker (and this is from a drummers point of view) is everytime he steps up to the plate he brings his own thing. he has his own sound and always comes up with really solid beats that create and complete the songs. but i do feel he's overated as many of his beats are very creatrive and unique but also very simple. He's no better at drums than ninety percent of the other pop punk drummers out there.    again though, Great Question!|`|AA10652867	He is a little bit overrated, but he is a pretty good drummer in his genre (ppunk/pop rock). But for having the title of the whole best metal drummer? No. Absolutely not.    Edit: I say that Casey Grillo is one of the best in the metal scene.|`|wOc4Dqllaa	He's probably the best drummer in the pop-punk genre, but metal... What the hell?|`|XK9RLaPeaa	I dont think anyone is really that into Travis Barker--> So how could he be overrated? I think the people who listen to his stuff, really like him. Not as a metal drummer, but as a punk rock drummer from him Blink182 days. I think is a good drummer.|`|FeZR63f8aa	I don't think he's overrated, but I'm wondering how the "Best Metal Drummer" came up, because that really doesn't make sense, it's not true...    He's a good drummer and has done good work.|`|1Z2SKvGNaa	kay Blink 182 is one of my most favorite bands and they're not metal so whoever wrote that is an idiot i don't think he's overrated he's an awesome drummer even thought you may not like pop-punk or Blink 182 that's your deal the only better drummer than him is...|`|SyoBirYDaa	He is overrated. I tell all of his fans in real life that he is.    Tomas from Meshuggah would destroy him in a drum contest.|`|rsCRnPnYaa	ya hes very very very over rated hes very good but not at the level everyone thinks he is.  andy hurley is just as good. but you look at like the guy from a7x he is amazingly good.  way better than travis barker.  plus travis barker as a straight up asshole|`|1Xeaef6paa	yes|`|DnWsMhwLaa	ummm blink 182 isnt metal and yes, he is worthless.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	Really overrated!

I also luv the song EL SHADDAI....and also Zola Levitt put out alot of great albums with Jewish/Israeli sounding music and some were up-tempo....

F1DviZEvaa	In Music -    Most Definatly, no worries there, he has the most orginal voice, yet he has an odd, pereplexity about it. yes!    In Dance -     Yes, Some poeple will say "well look at Neyo or Chris brown or even Samson they tear up the floor!" True, they do, BUT They  ALL ( with most singers etc) have been inspired by Michael himself!, So like i said, Yes, he would still be popular in this aspect, And then, he'll inspire some singers in about 25years later....,     In Video -    No one can beat it!, michael is the best artist, and video producer this world will ever see, did you know, he didnt Cherograph The Video "Bad", well he did, but not exactly, he just said to the dancer with him, "copy me when i make a sound",      As a human -     God yes, he still is the most interesting man on earth,     Conclusion -    Yes he would still be popular, BUT perhaps he wouldnt of opend as many doors in the entertainment industry.    Jackson 5ive -    (I know you didnt ask for this) but ill add it anyway, NO, yes he would be popular, but not as popular as most artists, as the Day of the Jacksons, well, like them, its getting old, yet they'll never die.    To let you know -    Michaels new album and tour! will give him enough money to buy back neverland, and to celebrate he will ask all of his fans to write in, the 13 best letters, to him, will earn there writers free access to neverland!|`|efQ0hac1aa	I think so, yes. But I'm glad that he isn't 25 and just recently starting a solo career. He paved the way for so many musicians and he's a very influential person.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	because his dance music from his "off the wall" album period was ahead of its time. if he would have stuck w/dance music he would've been a huge sucess in the dance halls/clubs of 2-day.|`|cRhkkBAEaa	That IS  good question. Well, to be honest, I dont think music would be the same as it is today if Michael hadnt have come about, coz he changed music. Thriller changed music and the world. And like someone has already said - Most of today's singers have been inspired by Michael himself!|`|ieOHteeMaa	hmmmm i think so cause  .........  he's Michael Jackson of course  da one and only K.O.P.  (king of pop lol)|`|fz77R5Jmaa	yes because his voice is incredible and his dance moves are jaw dropping and no one can do that still today|`|pT514qPUaa	Yes, certainly.  Why? You maybe know why. He is great, cool, and if he sing, all of his songs will be famous.   He's lucky. I'm sure he will success with his Thriller.|`|1H7Z3Pivaa	I think so. I bet no one will still be doing the moonwalk like he does right now and if he just came up doing the moonwalk just now, his competitors would still follow.|`|kqqXIEJtaa	hmmm thats a good question|`|N1wUHYKlaa	i think it would be somewhat successful. the music he has made is very great- he is a very talented musician. but i couldn't say that if he were younger in this time making that music, that it would be the same. the way music is now is because it's been influenced by the time- so it may not be what it was years ago.

gGZz2EGyaa	Long time since I was at school.  Worst memory was knowing that the next class we moved up to the male teacher was awful and cruel. He had this habit of picking on one boy and one girl all year, yes you guessed I was the girl.

So suppose the best moment would be when we moved out of that class onto the next one.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Best memory- finding out that my crush of 5 years liked me too  Worst memory- college!

xmdh8iY3aa	I'm going to say U-God. People think he's wack because of that one song he did. I think he brought alot to the Wu Tang. He contributed alot of dope verses and appearances on top Wu songs - Chessboxin, Protect Ya Neck, Triumph, Winter Warz. I think people make unfair comparisons to fellow Wu Tang members. U-God hasn't been given the stage of a Ghostface or Raekwon. If he got a solo deal with exclusive RZA production who knows what would have happened.|`|bik6rJZkaa	If unfair is they way they are treated, I will go w/ Lil Wayne. He is hated and/or loved way too much. It's either one extreme or the other. I think he's nice, but I will not say he's the greatest. Most folks you see have an extreme opinion of him. Either way with all of his publicity it will make it hard to sell him as a well known figure in hip hop.|`|PLJ8yd6Aaa	Lupe Fiasco- nobody gives him his credit and he's 10 times more lyrical then most of these ****** out now...100times better in the case of lil wayne and soulja boy|`|nAtBuBRhaa	I am gonna say Kanye. Only because he's not all wack. His early stuff is hot. But he's wack now. But, I think if he rapped 808's and Heartbreak, it would of been descent. I think he would be more respected if he actually showed his lyricism in his commercial tracks. I think College Dropout was a 5 mic album. And when he raps to those tracks he isn't wack. See most fans just listen to his new stuff and say he's wack. The way he samples is nice too. I like his soulful vibe. If he wasn't as cocky, and didn't use auto-tune, he would be the best rapper out in my books.    I am also gonna say Bun B. UGK is one of the hottest groups too come out of the south ever. And people are always saying he's wack, because he is from the south. I think Underground Kingz was the best mainstream album in 2007. And he has always been good. And ever since Pimp C passed (R.I.P.), many people say that Bun B was the wacker one in the group. I think both of them were both nice. You can't compare two nice flows. And many people call Bun out. And if he doesn't mention Pimp C in a song, concert, ad, etc.; than you call him out. You can't do that.    I also wanna say Ice Cube. He is one of the most underrated rappers out right now, and he is a legend, but people say that he's wack now. You can never do as well as your debut's. In my eyes, he's never had a wack album. How many MC's can say that? Just because he does movies, and TV shows, and stuff like that, people say he ain't being loyal to his roots. He's just getting money. And I'm glad he gets respect, because if he had to take it - it wouldn't be pretty. I think he still has the stamina to rip any MC up lyrically.    Their is a lot of MC's who get treated unfairly, but they do deserve it. I can name some, but most already know. And Jay-Z is a smart example too. But, the hip hop world is a weird one. One MC has one dope song or album, and then their rest is wack. I just tend to listen to MC's who are widely respected or are barely know to give respect towards.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	kanye for singing, i think rappin or singin kanye is the best|`|wfZhkZO0aa	@Pierre - Ja deserved what he got.  When you have skills as weak as his were and you go after Top Dogs like he did, you deserve to be annihilated.  And that's what happened to him.      S.B. gets mad hate and I think it has less to do with his music and more to do with his ignorance and the way he makes the genre look.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	50 Cent|`|CDnmuX1Jaa	Like you said.... Jay Z     This question is food for the Lil Wayne Stans    watch out :||`|gUYcVXMTaa	Im with you on this one.  I love me some Jay!  Cuz he still got time to give water out to everybody!

Is he better than a lot of rappers???? yes.....    is it unfair a lot of people rag on him for having no skills, when hes more talented than a lot of top-selling artists?? yes..    same w/nelly too|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Soulja Boy and Lil Wayne, obviously.|`|zVdNQowNaa	Soulja Boy....people treat him as though he's some sort of terrorist, he's just a wack knucklehead.    Ja Rule also, I mean DMX, Eminem and 50 Cent killed his career, but you'd think they killed him the way he just disappeared and moved away from the public like he did, I've never met a Ja Rule fan either, give the guy a break. I don't find his lyrics impressing, but there's worse rappers.|`|DDmFQU7raa	In Hova's case, he has changed considerable in the last few years. I used to be a big fan of his, but I've strayed away from him after 02-03. However, with everything he's accomplished, what else is there to prove? He's just having fun.    I think Snoop's another rapper that gets unfair treatment. I think people unfairly label him a sell out because he went away from his "gangsta" roots. As with Jay-Z, he's got nothing to prove, so why stick with the same thing?|`|h6AJ87N8aa	no i think Jay Z is treated fairly...anyone with mainstream access is going to be HATED or LOVED cuz u hear it so much.. but LIL WAYNE sticks out, people either talk **** without givin him a chance or give him way to much credit|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	1)KRS-One  He's hated on for preaching non-violence yet being violent (when he really preaches STOP the violence)  He's accused of being nonlyrical by the wayne di*kriders.    2)RA the Ruggedman  He's hated because. . .  because. . .  I guess people just don't like him because he never went under the wing of a black producer like Eminem and Bubba Sparxxx (?)    3)Wu-tang Clan  People hate on the Wu because they are fearless (crossover with Linkn Park, originated the G-Unit blueprint that G-Unit shat upon), outspoken (against everyone from fifty to soulja boy), and misunderstood (**).    4)Nas  Nas is hated because his whole career he's put lyrics first    5)Eminem  Eminem is hated on because he's overrated and therefore an easy target of hate. That being said, I don't listen to him, myself          and MY main issue with Jigga is he went from being Kane's protege to being an average MC that sells well.|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	You took the name right out of my mouth.

BKrqlGz4aa	"KMKCAD7276" is right in so far as he goes ... this is actually something that is starting to loom large on the horizon of the Star Wars world.      During an interview last year with Entertainment Weekly Lucas did indeed confirm that he is planning on bringing all 6 movies back to theaters in a true 3 - D format.  Lucas couldn't give a target date for this because, as was said, they are running into a lot of problems converting these 6 movies.  When asked if there will be anymore "tweaks" done to the films Lucas said that the OT would not be altered in any way ... it was finally the way he had always wanted to do them ... he also said that he didn't think much if anything would be done with the prequels although he did mention that the idea of switching out the "puppet Yoda" for a "CGI Yoda" in ep I was an idea that had been "tossed around some".  What that means is another of those only Lucas knows and he's not tellin' kind of things.    In recent "rumor mills" the summer of 2012 has become a very popular year for a bunch of stuff to come out in the Star Wars world.  It will be the 35 year anniversary of the release of ep IV and, if rumors are to ever become fact, there are big things planned for that year.  The two biggest are the before mentioned 3 - D release and the release of the Saga Book Set for the movies ... could be a fun year.    May The Force Be With You ...|`|B43x5RF8aa	Yes. He is planning on making them 3D and releasing them but he said in an interview it is taking longer than he had originally planned|`|NPQ17XfHaa	AFAIK, no, probably not. The last time he re-released, I believe, was when he actually redid the movies and put in new scenes. As awesome as it would be, I wouldn't get your hopes up.     ...Unless he does another trilogy. Which will hopefully be better than the prequels. Galen Marek FTW.
wU0c3i7baa	Strange. I live in America, but whenever I go to the UK I'm shocked by how much you CAN say or show on British tv. For instance, American network television prohibits nudity and strong language. The Brits can show naked men and say pretty much any curse word after a certain time. It's a hard pill for many of us Americans to swallow.    Taking that into consideration, I'm shocked that they would censor content from the Simpsons, which is obviously a satirical show that makes fun of everyone. It's much, much tamer than something like South Park. Weird.|`|llTqn0Tbaa	i hate censorship  they should take it out worldwide  and i thought europe was more liberal???|`|dqw1iH6haa	yer its horrible when they miss bits out of friends and scrubs just because they are on during the daytime
c8HHi3Wqaa	I come to a complete stop for 3 mississippi seconds while looking both ways prior to entering into the intersection in a safe manner.|`|4ZaAZgCgaa	Nope, I roll right through it.  And I've never been behind someone who comes to a complete stop, even when I'm behind a police car.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	When no one is around for miles I roll. But when I have a tailgater behind me, I stop. It makes them mad. lol|`|AA10283080	Complete stop.    I like to p i s s off the people behind me who try to do a california roll and expect me to do the same.    Stop means stop...not yield.|`|1PGmB4JNaa	seventeen and don't know how to drive|`|lN9jcKYhaa	I did that the other day and the white mustang behind me turned out to be an undercover cop. He pulled me over and since I don't have any violations on my record, he let me off with a warning.|`|ucVgUcDvaa	Hey I resent that- I am from CA and we roll but we stop too. Have to now a days. People are color blind and do not see the red lights when it first hits the street.    CA is losing their officers too. - economics.|`|AA10838250	stop|`|3yNh5jO8aa	I'm from California. I'm required to roll.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	If all is clear - cali roll    if there's a cop anywhere near - complete stop ?    I got a ticket for totally pausing on a "not even used in the daytime" road at 2 am - there was NOTHING around except the hidden patrol car    so - if i am positive there are no cops - I roll, if I have any doubt - I stop even if the guy behind me hits me for it.  That happened too - the guy was like "what the hell did you stop for?" and I pointed to the cop - at which point he said "oh, sorry - I didnt see him"|`|zntOXCfuaa	I come to a complete stop.  I live in Chicago, and some people drive like idiots, so I'm extra cautious.|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	I come to a stop now because I got a stern warning from a cop.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	depends on who's watching...|`|kA7GEKf7aa	Pretend like I'm going to do a california roll, stop, and then reverse. It gets the cars behind me every time. :)|`|Uc96X3T3aa	I come to a complete stop now, but I was on a back road and I decided to do that roll stop and a cop came out of nowhere. He wrote me a ticket too! It was like 200 in the afternoon! I am serious  I would stop completely. I also was pulling out of my long driveway once and looked once to the right then straightforward I hit the gas and I pulled out in front of car and almost made them wreck~That was so close.|`|Jph6y9viaa	stop completely|`|nbN50XoFaa	cali roll!!!|`|nijx1J00aa	i try to as often as possible...    by the way, they call that a "chicago stop" in chicago and a "mass-hole roll" in massachusetts...|`|dBrGgTVjaa	depends if there are visable cops around or sketchy cars around.|`|gs4fwiaqaa	I usually come to a complete stop, but I am just paranoid about safety. [: |`|wPD3BGEHaa	california roll, the stop signs outlined in white are optional...smiles|`|9eBruYtqaa	isn't a california roll sushi??? here in dc we call it a rolling stop|`|TPQkhVxQaa	Usually a california roll.

You never know where a cop might be lurking.|`|jeLehwmpaa	well when your in california you do the california roll  its like an unwritten law.  and when your in Detroit you gotta do the Detroit lean...|`|cHiv6eTWaa	I make a very brief stop as to just not get arrested because giving my hard earned money to the state when I need it more than they do sucks big time.|`|FkY5P2Xqaa	cali roll if its on a slow street and i dont see anyone around.|`|15e4b23d09e63ca5a1ecc092fae0dadcaa	Depends on the situation....Where I'm at, if I'm in a hurry, if there's kids around,......|`|oP8blO9Paa	stop completely|`|17fc727d7da626634a4721e34bc49363aa	I had a rash of tickets a long time ago and decided to be as much of a Boy Scout on the road as I am off, partly due to repeated wasted days at traffic school and the fines, but mostly because I've seen some pretty bad accidents (I ride a motorcycle mostly and avoid cars) due to bad drivers who think the road belongs to them.  I haven had a ticket since 1987.|`|izZqdgazaa	Complete stop!|`|bwOPe5Jyaa	I got a $150 dollar ticket for not stopping completely|`|TXGY0X8Vaa	roll right through them but i always look if theres a cop sitting there then i slam on the brakes|`|6In638rbaa	I hate doing complete stops so most of the time I do a little california roll.    *I thought you were talking about Sushi for a sec when I first saw the question. hehehe.|`|BqXSymxjaa	I stop. I don't like tickets.|`|HUy7ugDUaa	My father was a state policemen in Delaware and he told me as long as you pull up to the stop sign or light spell S. T. O. P. then go it's fine.|`|yDQ7t317aa	Well I used to always roll right through them. Until that motorcycle cop I didn't see saw me and gave me a ticket. But I can say that I am still kinda guilty of it. But I do try to stop sometimes but I just can't help it. And what really pisses me off is when someone stops at a stop sign for way too long. Naybe that's why I don't stop most the time, I dunno.

GeyFdO5jaa	I   Think  its totally wrong and very  disturbing|`|yRE2HDr3aa	Yes.    I think they should figure out a way to clone organs only.

Bring on the clones, seriously!|`|DvjX2DFKaa	Of course you'd only clone the very best, (you and me) and you would never clone defectives like, say, politicians and lawyers.|`|dd7f6eb566c0d6a7067106dd5cbbc4e3aa	i agree with aleesh|`|AA10817491	I think its wrong to clone humans.

Why, clone more just like them?|`|AA10742567	I don't think it's right.  Cloned animals I am alright with I think, but people should come about the natural way.

But actual people is creepy I think.|`|812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	You fail to appreciate that you are also a mutant freak as there are defects in your genes and it is certain that yours vary from the sum of the parts inherited from your parents.

We know your opinion, and we also know that all the logic in the world will not stop you from pulling the "playing god" card. Get a brain, not a 2000 yr old book written and warped by, for the most part, manipulative twerps. If you can draw a logical argument from the God card, pull it out, but please, no inherent truths here, because to anyone with a brain your truths are blabber.    Has anyone seen the Family Guy episode when Peter has a stroke and loses the control of an entire side of his body? He doesn't know what to do until he sees a sign saying "Stem Cell Research, walk-ins welcome". He walks in, and .5 seconds later he walks out cured. He then says "Whyyyy Are we not FUNDING this????"    Though this is a mass exaggeration, the truth is that with enough money, this could become almost a reality in 5, 10 yrs max.     Human cloning for the sake of human experimentation is unquestionably unethical, not to mention a violation of basic human rights.     Human cloning to conceive an actual child is as ethical as having a child through sex. What difference is there besides the fact that the sperm that fertilized the egg may have sat in a frozen test tube for a while?    Your comment of "mutant freaks", while fun on the movie screen, is entirely false. The chance that a cloned human would have genetic mutations is exactly the same probability as a regular human having mutations. A simple understanding of meiosis can tell you that.    I don't know what the practical reasons would be for cloning humans, but if it can help lives without creating new problems, I see no reason why anyone with the intention of improving their world would have a problem with it. The church's opinion of God's purpose has help humanity back for long eough.|`|43JgLpkKaa	yes , it should be banned. God never intended us to .. clone .. another being. he made us the way he wanted , and he wants us to be .. formed .. the traditional way. 1 sperm and 1 egg = the correct way !|`|cI0dF22yaa	Yeah, I agree with you.

I do agree with you in some ways but I don't think it should be banned.|`|QTxdNavKaa	It could really help us understand how we're made and function.   The science could open our eyes to new genetically knowledge enabling us to prevent disturbing flaws that we're already faced with.|`|rjac15O0aa	Is it possible that we could clone humans to use them as organ donors?|`|QPiIRyDYaa	Its about as natural as an ear growing on the back of a mouse.

And as a result, I had problems with heart burn. Instead of getting rid the heartburn the same day or next, I was stuck the whole time I was sick. The first time I was sick, there was a couple days I went without food because of the heartburn, but then broke down and ate a little 48 hours later when I felt myself getting close to passing out.   With the second time, at least it did not affect my voice. The first time, I could barely speak above a whisper when I tried to talk. And it cracked BAAAAAAAD.

But it has been three years since I'd had a cold or flu....so it was probably my turn...;)   I stopped taking echinacea and Vit C for three months, think thats why...|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Yeah, but then i hardly ever get ill; when i do, it's usually milder than other peoples' symptoms. I seem to have a good immune system.|`|WWT45CEzaa	so far yes    just lucky i guest|`|4aYNKp2Xaa	So far I've caught the flu and two minor colds.  I actually have a cold right now and it sucks trying to sleep at night because I can't breathe.  *grabs tissue* :(

My excuse is that I had a hippie for an English teacher! He was all 'Like man, Shakespeare couldn't spell his name, so does it cosmically matter if you can't spell Chrysanthemum?'|`|kR6hptDvaa	yup        (you made me laugh)|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Yes.|`|DtcuaIWmaa	I'm not the worlds greats speller but who cares|`|XCtjuhujaa	yesh, corse i cn spel.

Of course, but it does depend upon which language you are looking for with regards to accuracy, the American or the English version!    Personally, I am a great advocate of self defenestration for all heinous crimes in this arena.    Sash.|`|3d6119cf4a9df27c12f9843ac9018153aa	shat ap|`|61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	I thought i could but i am always getting pulled up by yahoo  spell checker.lol|`|9973c6e02e14ba355b22d50b1410ec1baa	Yis|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	Seeriusslee, yays!|`|JnnBiFK4aa	im ok. sometimes i forget the simpliest word tho
qXq0nmBzaa	I try to use "standard" or "traditional".    "Normal" can have so many off-putting connotations.|`|QWMPWia4aa	I do!|`|9BB5H7aJaa	No, but the word "random" bothers me senseless.|`|zEp6xHacaa	and why does everyone try to be normal|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	no..not normally..|`|EGcMzg0Paa	yes because there is no right defintion!   people have their own words to describe whats normal and to use that word is completely not fair.  thats an interesting question|`|PYmpqmmAaa	What is NORMAL?|`|zs38LPu4aa	never heard it before, what does it mean|`|AA10598858	If you're talking about when someone is telling you, like... "Act like a normal person", then yes, I do not like it. Seeing that a 'normal' person does not exist, I don't understand how they can classify someone as that. There is an 'average' person, but not a 'normal' person. Everyone has faults, so not one person is 'normal'.|`|klhFMdCgaa	Normal is an illusion. No one is normal because the definition changes from person to person.
vFF5vwqsaa	No, it was Michel Fran?ois|`|iZgtcAcAaa	NO: Michel Fran?ois as Lequerec
KA4Ga5Wraa	Yes he did. He's a very talented cartoonist.
89FgPZ9Waa	Wow.. so romantic..  i like it on the lips.|`|6j8d7TZTaa	KISSES EVERYWHERE ARE GREAT.|`|1hiImyBdaa	Kiss on the Lips.|`|oSfXwfnfaa	Well, of course i love the kiss on the lips, plus its meaning. but i also love the kiss on the forehead and on the neck.
AA11139157	first off, you should look at your birth information as a form of 'let me learn more about me and my partner' and i wouldn't suggest using it to see if you and your partner are compatible because if it states negatives you will think o gosh this is not meant to be. with me and my partner (i am a leo and my partner a gemini [a gemini's sign tends to be unfaithful and it makes me rethink everything) so out of personal experience be careful.    ok here is your sun sign info:    Sun in Aquarius       (The Sun is in Aquarius from approximately January 20 to February 18, depending on the year).    One of the standout characteristics of those born under the Sun Sign of Aquarius is their unwillingness to follow the beaten track. With advancement and progress on their minds, there can be an irreverence to old and outdated ways of thinking and doing things.      Many Aquarians aim to free themselves of personal and social conditioning. Although open to change in theory, Aquarians can be surprisingly stubborn. Their idealism runs strong, but they can be very fixed in their opinions.      Often a bit aloof and even standoffish, Aquarians nonetheless are usually well-liked. They are curious and observant, and tolerant in a broad sense. Prejudice and bias is offensive to the typical Aquarius.      Aquarians are generally very clever, witty, and intellectual. They value progress and frankness. It's difficult to throw Aquarians for a loopthey're generally on top of things.     There is a bit of reformer in Aquarius. They'll try to get you to see through superficiality, and encourage you to be open and forthright. "Be true to yourself" and "Don't follow the crowd" are mottos we easily associate with this sign.     Aquarians need space and value personal freedom. Any attempt to box them in will likely fail. They'll happily return the favor; and they will treat people from all walks of life as equals. Equality and fairness are hallmarks of the sign. If you're quirky and "different", all the better.     my best friend is an aquarian and from what i can tell aquarians are EXTREMLY emotional, everything bothers them, everything offends.     your moon sign:    Moon in Leo       Depending on other positions in the chart, Moon in Leo people are not necessarily outgoing. When they feel comfortable, they do like being the center of attention. That is, they like being in the "spotlight" in the comfort of their own homes and with family and friends. They enjoy entertaining others, and often take on the role of comic.    Lunar Leos often feel a need to organize, and even control, their families and friends. They have an inner mission to set things right, and generally like to oversee the goings-on in their little circle.      This is a rather creative position of the Moon. At the very least, Moon in Leo people want to create and entertain. They can be rather lazy at times, and a little bossy too. Generally, though, they have a deep need to treat others fairly and justly.    Lunar Leos require lots and lots of love and lots of love and care in order to function well in the world. When they feel slighted, these people can be dramatic in their emotional displays. When their pride has been hurt, they are given to big scenes and sulking. This rarely happens in public, however. Lunar Leos are far too concerned about their image to make splashy scenes outside the comfort of their own homes. In public, they prefer to take things in dignified ways. At home, however, they're given to big displays of emotional drama. These scenes generally don't last too long, however. Lunar Leos are often personally popular folk who are valued for their integrity and strong sense of justice.    Generally, it is easy to reason with a Lunar Lion. Appealing to their well-developed sense of fairness usually works well.      my sun sign is leo, it is a very me, me, me sign lol. the moon sign (leo) isn't as intense as the sun sign leo, so your leo traits are rather subdued and underdefined in a more less fashion.     ascendant: capricorn-    Capricorn Ascendant        There's a seriousness to Capricorn rising people that is unmistakable. Even when they're joking around, it's of the deadpan variety. In fact, plenty of very humorous people have Capricorn Ascendants. It's all in the timing...and the fact that they don't giggle before the joke is over.   Capricorn Ascendant people project competence. They simply ooze it. They're generally very image-conscious peoplethe clothes they wear and their manner are a big deal to them. They want to appear successful, and they generally succeed!     Often the Ascendant persona is the one that was forced upon us by family conditioning. For example, parents may label their Libra Ascendant child the "nice" one; their Aries Ascendant child the "independent" one; and their Pisces Ascendant child is generally the space cadet of the family. We adopt these roles as familiar ones, and often carry them with us as our defense mechanisms, in|`|2Gve5Xigaa	follow your heat ,not astrology
RFn0AiSnaa	my day was good so far, i went to college and had math and now i am going to workout! then after working out i went to the golf dome.|`|tg4K6bIYaa	so far so good|`|auiCxp2faa	eh im in school...  so, okay i guess|`|hsvgllTwaa	not too bad, not too bad...went in to college, and every lesson was cancelled apart from one..which was a good one! so i cant complain about that :D and going swimming in a bit :)    how was yours?   xx|`|jeLehwmpaa	well randy you seem so happy asking this question all in caps         i am having kind of a crapy day in sick and sleepy and stuck at school.|`|XS0ltAYaaa	Going from bad to worse, thank you very much. I just had a call to say my dad is going deaf & my 19 yr old son has just had a b*tch fit because I won't up his allowance.   How's your day, I hope its better than mine has been ?|`|NmtgziADaa	Actually now that you asked, its going really bad, i got into a political debate with my mom and i lost. I am at work and no one can afford ne thing so that makes me have less money in my pay check. my fiance is laid off and can't find work at all. we owe money towards everything and i had to pay in NY state tax this year. Also they jacked the price of the energy drink. that i have everyday. my cat peed on something right b4 i left the house and my dog ate an incense burner. its so cold that my car wouldn't start. but it managed on the third try. and my roomate just got laid off from ups. all is well|`|UVciAbXxaa	good as long as i talk to my girl every day is good =]|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	just spiffy|`|jBKiD5ugaa	Horrible day so far, Randy.|`|d5d2932031efa991954aa3468bb79f0faa	I don't know.   I think I need a beano pill.|`|iEYBCL1Naa	wet|`|MzZ1xenkaa	so far so good  cant complain
Rvl6JPZraa	Can't wait either!    After last season, hope things go better for the family and the DA.
Ow3O7h4caa	Capricorn two-faced is possible . It depends on his rising sign which could be Gemini or VIRGO.    A badly afflicted Pisces rising can give this especially if Neptune is rising and afflicted by Jupiter Or Mercury.    Libra|`|11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	yes, gemini is the most two-faced sign, although, i've known some cancers to turn pretty insane when they feel inferior or threatened.|`|Vq6YgKICaa	Two faced is someone who talks or does things behind your back.    But what you are describing is someone who is moody.  But I don't see anything abnormal about this person you're describing, as no one is the same every single day.  People change and go thru moods all the time.  I don't think anything of this guy you're describing.  I don't want to make something out of nothing.|`|55acd912d46c891e2f509b886eb2c15daa	First of all, don't go picking on the Capricorns because that's not the way to go about it.  Second, being two-faced doesn't have to be under a zodiac sign.  Being two-faced is universal.  People live double lives, they have two-faces, they say one thing and turn around and do another.  Basic human nature.  It's crap but it's real.|`|sQUo9vAeaa	Sounds like you've got to know this Capricorn pretty well.  I know at least 4 other Capricorn men & 3 woman.  Not my favorite sign.  Like all zodiac, they 2 have the darker side of their personality.  Capricorns are pretty O.K. People, but if they don't agree with what you're saying or they have something to say  Their answer out weighs all other answer (according to them) I guess they're kind of a Blow Hard.  As well they are very controlling & self rightious...UG!    They are 1 of they best signs for understanding business concepts...they can't be allowed to be the 1 and only for all desisions. Unaware that they 2 make mistakes.|`|FNyZ5puhaa	I luv all the opinions posted but I will have to agree best with ashna.meow    I know everyone may have a darker side to them but for a Capricorn like myself it brings out the worst in me. I fully understand what you're saying here, sometimes we're good and sometimes we're arrogant or seem entirely different.    I have 1 air sign (Gemini) in my chart so I'm not sure if Gemini has anything to do with it or if it's just our personality on a whole.     Thanks 4 asking this question!|`|G67bniRcaa	I agree, I would guess he probably has the moon in gemini. Though caps can be very calculating and decieving. Arrogance is definatly one of their traits.|`|w7wjpuIsaa	I agree with you Gems are the worst for this but caps come in a close second imagine a union of the 2 some fireworks there LOL|`|BxVGLhheaa	yea

Huge muscles and abs=cheap=gorilla=king kong-hulk=yuck.lol  Big muscled guys look gay to me,and very self aware of themselves and their,supposetly "good looks".That's definitely not good looks to me.I wanna be with a real guy,not with a muscle filled gorilla.

vmv1rP76aa	Ugh I know what you mean angels. = (     I am so sorry to hear that happened to you, I really am. Some people just think the world owes them and they should automatically do everything for them.     Don't let it get to you, that lady was just a b*tch (sorry, no better term).    If it makes you feel any better, I'll tell you some of my own experiences with that kind of stuff.     One time there was a lady that was cleaning in the mall (it was a real ghetto mall) and some chairs were blocking her way. I move them for her and she says nothing so I say "you're welcome" and all I get is this dirty, grimy look.     Another time, there was this old lady standing in front of the door. I let myself and my friend in, unaware that she was waiting, and behind me I hear "thank you! OH GLORIOUS DAY!" real sarcastically. She actually expected me to bow down to her and open it for her. Goes to show you how some people think the world owes them something.     You're damned if you DO help someone and damned if you DON'T. Its sad anymore angels. But just so you know if you would've done that for me I would've said thank you and smiled back, I really would have. I love people like you seriously, wish there were more kind people in the world.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	My sister and I were just talking about how rude people are the other day.  You hold the door for someone, not only do they not thank you, but they look at you like you are nuts!    People just have no manners nowadays I think.  Rudeness is all over.  It's sad.    I don't care how lousy my day is going, if someone does something nice for me like that, I thank them for it.  I always wave thanks if someone lets me in the lane when I signal on the highway too.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	mistake - you didnt hit her with the door ?    I call it "instant karma"    however - I think you are the better person.  Not that my opinion matters or anything|`|3yNh5jO8aa	crotchety old woman! we call them snow-birds around here. They flock back to my state every winter.|`|P8uh4joQaa	because everyone knows you can't get something for nothing.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Unexpected kindness may not common, or appreciated in some places. Good job!  Have a nice day!|`|3wFt9fyZaa	People suck.  You just have to hope for the best.|`|THuplVHpaa	Some people just suck nowadays. You can please them all. Jerkfaces!!!|`|iEYBCL1Naa	what a loser. they dnt realise theres good people in the world still|`|d5d2932031efa991954aa3468bb79f0faa	She must have been from a different planet or something! Wow!!|`|nuLroEjraa	she's not used to people being nice for nothing in return.|`|kTc3bfrRaa	are  you in  NYC..??      thats  common  incoutresy!!      maybe  she  got  fired from  wendys!!|`|dqCTS60raa	Yeah people with attitutes, I hate them|`|UxSF3Doaaa	Thank you SOOOOO much angel for showing that kind people STILL exist, and thanks for being the big person of the situation! Seriously and genuinely mean that!    If that was me you held the door for, you would have gotten my thanks for sure!    I guess either the lady has misconcepted you thinking you were having an ulterior motive or people failing to realize that kind people are still out there. Or just taking others for granted. Who knows.    Don't let this incident change you. We need all the kindness we can get in this world, and by still opening the doors for others, means you are being the bigger person as long as you are genuine ( and I know you were!)    (((((ANGEL))))))|`|aCUHzMrmaa	She was probably confused cause most people arnt that nice.  I would be pissed too though! I offered to help this lady in a wheel chair who was stuck in a puddle LOL, but she yelled atme and said get away. I guess i look kinda scary tho but yea...|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	Some people are just hateful. Just ignore the hateful things they have to say.|`|njlBV9Enaa	maybe she's going through hard times.|`|khnMoQNoaa	has happened to me on several occasions   i tried to let a woman have my seat on the train as she looked tired and she turned and shouted at me     "if i wanted help i'd ask for it"|`|tGZqtBNLaa	Some people are like that . they think that when someone does something nice its because they want something . I guess she isn't use to someone being genuinely nice and trying to help .|`|nBDDO8L3aa	ANGEL  it is so nice that you would want to do that, not to many do that honey, but i think people are afraid or think there is a hidden motive when you do something kind,     don't stop doing those for others, that's what is wrong with the world we stopped caring>      hot man for you >>>>>>|`|Z98TpALPaa	I guess some people are just...like that.  Hahah.  I never understood it either, yet I'm only 13.    My thoughts ---->http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXWXQeHCW...      :]|`|EGcMzg0Paa	chroachy old woman!!!!!!!!!!!|`|z64ofypJaa	Sounds like she's just a *****. At least the guy behind her said thanks.|`|Z0nooDxDaa	i hate that, when u help someone and they do not even appreciate it, they automatically think you are after something, you cant be nice to anyone anymore without them thinking something is up.|`|AA11297232	That was very nice of you. I often hold the door so that those behind me can follow and most people say thank you. Haven't actually have someone opening a door for me yet, but i would be grateful and thank them. There are some people out there that feels the world owes them everything and they don't have to do anything in return. Ignore them, they obviously left their manners under the kitchen table.:)

But for sure, the mobile phone and her social life should be nothing but a fond memory.|`|PH1eFiqwaa	I had the wooden spoon used on me (a lot), and it made an impact on me.  I use a wooden spoon on my children.  There is no reason that a good spanking is wrong.  I do not beat them but a few smacks on the backside work wonders.  Also I would do all that you have said.  And when she gets her laptop back, I would block all sites I did not want her to visit.  School work is one thing, but what you describe is not school work.  I would not return the phone at all. And doing chores around the house works wonder also.  I would limit the time on the laptop when she does get it back also.|`|e2JxDMAZaa	take away all phone privlidges.|`|807fcae559f0d52cb9c4a617e1ab098aaa	SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	First explain to her what she did, because she sounds selfish and wont get it at first  Then take it all away from her, teach what she had and what value and previlage it is.

rabjcdjHaa	I don't blame Katrina for Rose leaving either! It was Rose's fault that she got eliminated! She forgot the words to the song! She can only blame herself for being eliminated! I do blame Katrina for not giving her group the time they needed to practice, but Rose still should have remembered the words to her part!    Even though I don't blame Katrina for Rose leaving, I was happy Katrina got eliminated! Katrina was just using Idol to get attention! I'm glad she's gone!  I do feel bad that Rose got eliminated though, because she actually cared about being on the show and she wanted a singing career!|`|nztycnvfaa	I think both Katrina and Rose were terrible. The right person from the group made it through. She was the only one that could actually sing.|`|1TXJDiedaa	She is a dumb whore, thats why|`|zXQMS04haa	The question is why would anyone be upset that Rose Flack didn't make it? Her voice isn't that great. Please, people, stop praising Rose Flack. OMG.    Bikini Girl is annoying girl flaunting herself like a typical beach babe who has very few brain cells. I'll admit, she's got a good voice, but not the greatest. Glad she's gone.|`|yJd1WwF2aa	No Katrina sucked!!!! Hell for u to like her u must be her! She couldn't sing and was a total b8tch to the people in her group. They wanted to practise and she was all "i'm sleepy bye"  Then the next day they tried to get her up and she layed in bed for hours! then came to the table and said "teach me everything you guys did last night"     Rose was an amazing singer and u would know that if u saw her audition, Katrina screwed her group by walking out then coming in right before they had to preform. It through them all off and only the one girl was able to but her emotional aside. Rose was upset and the group wasn't allowed practise time they need all thanks to Katrina!!|`|bpyx92GZaa	Because she is a pure SL*TTY B*TCH who just wanted her 15 mins of fame and really didn't care about singing as a group. Rose and the other girls sung better than Katrina, the skinny anorexia B*TCH...lmao My dog sings better than her...lolol
ev353FQMaa	Yea they was hatin'.|`|1TXJDiedaa	She is a dumb whore, could sing worth a shi*.

She was a complete joke. She had absolutely no talent whatsoever. I am happy she's gone. Also there is no way she can come back as a wild card.     The wild card doesn't come into play until the Top 36 aka the semifinals. This is where if America does not vote a person into the Top 12 directly, they are given another shot in the wild card episode. However, here the judges pick which three they think deserve to be in the Top 12 not the voters.|`|CCYWYk3qaa	i was thrilled to see Katrina go home! I laughed at Kara when she made one last word where they had to bleeped it out. Katrina was nasil and sang in her head voice 95% of the time...annoying. She had to go and glad she did...|`|HUy7ugDUaa	PLEASE, she came on the show expecting that she would get to the top 12 because she was pretty and had a nice body. You can tell that she is a spoiled LITTLE girl. She doesn't have any talent and the olny reason she got as far as she got was because she stroked Simons manly ego.|`|5mb1bnvxaa	I think she saved herself the embarrassment of going any further.... she was horrible and she was mean, and she didn't deserve to even make it past phoenix..... good riddence.... Maybe she should call Hugh Hefner to see if he has an opening in the playboy mansion....

It is first a job (to make it) then it's a YUMMY sammach!|`|HMhUKAgkaa	I work for a fluffernutter.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	I'm going to say sandwich, because that'd be a pretty hairy job.|`|14gi4aTvaa	Cumbersnatch|`|YdXhZka8aa	Well I hope it's a sammach as I practically lived off them when I was younger.  A 'fluffer' is someone who aspires to actually be in pornos but gets a back stage job instead.|`|G1lSbvAQaa	HAHAH! I get it! A fluffernutter job haha.    No but it's a sandwich.
rdBKZerlaa	You're the slowest typer EVAR....    My side boob is awesome b/c I am awesome|`|m7m9Xu24aa	Because you know instantly how it will fit in your hand!|`|1whFJDiVaa	I like top boobage.    usually they are on their knees when you're getting that view|`|HBeuykQBaa	I love that...It just makes guys forget what they were talking to me about!    |`|51Fmu8zkaa	Hey...My eyes are up here!|`|AA10283080	I've often wondered about the obsession men have with side boobage.....wouldn't frontal boobage be better?|`|G2WgHzu5aa	because 4 people can have some at the same time?|`|NY2fpmvPaa	I don't know. My husband likes the "under boobage" the best.     So weird.    I don't get all the obsession with boobs. They are NOT that cool. My husband gives me a freakin' mamogram daily. So annoying!|`|vRmsvSb6aa	That's my side boob. I love Peter Griffin.|`|VKbCQkTRaa	Well, it's only awesome if they actually have boobs...|`|GTeGDGzKaa	I totally agree    8===========>    SteveC|`|9ed226ee22a85f302293fed29122bfe1aa	Anything with the word 'boob' in is awesome.|`|UL3sHgqNaa	That is like asking why the sky is blue....no one knows it just is|`|9eBruYtqaa	it's awesome with little perky boobs, i guarantee it wouldn't be so awesome with my double d's.|`|uQUqZ7k5aa	i am not sure, i think it is because we don't get to see it as much as top boobage.    bottom boobage is also great.|`|VSRyCQyVaa	It gives you a little sneak preview.     But I prefer the downblouse view myself...unfortunately, many women do not share my enthusiasm for that when they catch me looking.|`|BJkfY3g4aa	What's side boobage? I just have front boobage..I think.|`|PMQWI1Ojaa	I think my grandma had that, she just called it overflow.  Sometimes it flowed round to the front even.  Is it sexy now?|`|8CUfDxRtaa	It's one of my favorite boobage angles!
IKCfT9tnaa	yesterday. Honestly...there was a fellow on my wing watching porn...was my job to call  the meetin' to order!|`|sorb72tMaa	Never!!!    Does Come To Papa Count ?!|`|51Fmu8zkaa	I think my Aunt dragged me to one of those when I was about 10...unless you mean the "Oh God, Oh God" kind...(last night)|`|0154e31673244b2bea94b54516ec675aaa	when he wanted me to stop by his work to see how my company could insure him best|`|oP8blO9Paa	'95. on the lost sheep end.|`|m7m9Xu24aa	I was on the end of his tip.    Jesus is my Spanish counselor.|`|Hw3n0nenaa	Last night !     Hey even old people get to have fun.|`|JOcLk4DNaa	When I died. I was on the bad end.|`|fx6pNJ5saa	Hubbs got drunk a couple of months ago and preached to me about finding God...it was uncomfortable|`|zRUHryuraa	a what?|`|nmDbEgXQaa	Never. What are those anyway? Educate a Jewish girl!|`|215d3acf00f732b247b6cc433098b991aa	i don't recall going to a "come to jesus" meeting|`|hoZE1vi0aa	Missed out so far...|`|3bApbb2yaa	Jesus??  I saw a pic of him with Whitey Bulger.|`|7vBJGMvtaa	how is that working for ya there?i think we'll all meet jesus sooner or later!|`|nqlk9iUCaa	I don't plan on EVAR going to one.. Not even when i'm 80  Might as well go to R&S!|`|wAm2fsztaa	in the morning|`|raUjKchLaa	I was in high school when I attended the last one and it scared me right back into my family church.|`|FkhFIIsjaa	*cries*        *cries again*|`|RluCMVUSaa	My husband* and I had a come to Jesus meeting on Christmas day... he put on a Jesus costume and we laid away in a manger... I was on the receiving end (he is bashful from behind)... he whipped me with his crown of thorns and tied me to the cross (bed)... the funny thing about this meeting is that we both came... but wait, I hear Jesus calling again he is saying "come sinner come"... gotta run!
A15bfvkBaa	Because it will get expired.|`|aajzynKsaa	So you can eat it before it turns fresh.|`|BoXaXUiYaa	Never mind that expiration date. You can keep sour cream for 50 years.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Because sooner or later it will get so rank it will kill you.|`|0gdBjXb1aa	have you ever looked at sour cream after the expiration date?  that why...lol|`|a4993552752cc787c811fe933d03022daa	so that people know when its no longer good for human consumption and health|`|Z0CwQf4Haa	Because after that it will turn sweet.|`|dlY5xY5oaa	good question.   i mean.   it's all ready soured.. how much worse could it get??
K4GiKOhPaa	I've had it happen. Ask the person what you did. It might not be you at all, but something else entirely.|`|kg6H6HDuaa	Yeah and then you either get angry at them or spend forever and a day trying to fix it (sooooo time consuming)|`|KkSW6EViaa	i think we all have at some time, lol.    :)|`|KFpEaY3raa	daily i am married lol|`|AA10460376	Yeah I seem to do that a lot and I am clueless as to why they became so angry with me....I have to really work on that|`|GqDaGHUBaa	sometimes|`|JD3yWKNGaa	Yes, I told my sister she was a procrastinator (which she is the definition of) and then she got all mad and wouldn't talk to me. I said it jokingly, but it was true.|`|16rD9k32aa	I've been married for almost 20 years, and have two daughters.  Of course I have. More than I care to think about. It sucks trying to figure out what you did wrong, and you don't dare ask. That leads to the question, "Why do you THINK I'm man at you?!" An unanswerable question if ever there was one. At least if you know what's good for you.|`|UgNHBJ3Jaa	i usually say that when i know what i done but am acting all innocent lol|`|BMYOukx5aa	LOL, all the time! like, what did I do! ummm I don't get it|`|UIzaamJ7aa	Yeah. But I try to pretend I did it intentionally.|`|pHteEAF8aa	yeah...     it happens.|`|O5vTSHnqaa	yea...|`|hIrBZS3oaa	Men can be more secretive than women when it comes to finding out what set them off.|`|bfb1d3f4961608dfad0375bd5f169b0aaa	A lot.|`|Ju8PJZsraa	yes.   i give them time to cool off before i ask what i did......im pretty to the point when it comes to those things.|`|bBHlGs5waa	Yes I have and then when I asked them what did I do wrong, they said "You know damn well what you did!" LOL.|`|a0YeSoBEaa	i do it all the time.but hey, so what|`|186deac21531919b3fa042717df297e7aa	yes many times xxx|`|eWjxwNucaa	yes and then they would not explain what i had done wrong !|`|BpMI22Lbaa	Yes and it drives me insane because I feel guilty but I don't know what I'm guilty about. I always make it worse in the end.|`|6fbce3ff42dd216a83c3e009ccebb0eeaa	Yep...about 5 years ago..and it still bugs me..|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	I do it all the time with my husband.  The infuriating thing is when they don't tell you what you've done to upset or annoy them which means you're on line to do it again.|`|2Hqb8lmjaa	Yep i do it all the time - saves arguments and if it really bad then revenge is a dish best served cold.    But this was a lie....    I had a carer for my son. I paid her high wages of 200 per month to look after him 3 hours on a Saturday 2pm to 5pm. 12 hours per month!  We became good friends and when my commitment ended the girl in  question still wanted to come to our house on a Saturday so i decided to keep paying her the 200 per month and she didn't do anything for my son.  We went out and about during the day, i bought her stuff etc and i listened to all her problems. I was a really good friend.   2 years later she text me saying i did not respect her enough and she did not want to be friends anymore!   Truth was she got herself a bf who was jealous of our friendship!  Her loss i say but i know i treated her well and i still feel confused about that relationship and i hope the old saying what comes around goes around and the same happens to her.|`|61fcf832e5d4b87f1c941578ef4bacd3aa	That's happened to me quite a few times. Another thing is that certain women think that I'm interested in them. When in reality, I"M NOT.  SHEESH!!!|`|KyxvvvDXaa	all the time|`|ICHU3DZRaa	yep.  drama, drama, drama....|`|rpqHLJGGaa	so many times|`|rqiXZk87aa	yessir people can be so damn deffensive sometimes !|`|6W7nJYskaa	Yes. Apparently I upset Yahoo! who removed a perfectly reasonable answer of mine for no viable reason.    **stalks off grumbling**    :-)|`|y3Yu3DCDaa	i constantly do that. no big deal anymore.|`|WSbfkuSZaa	yes  its so annoying and immature when they won't tell you|`|LDLTjNCraa	Yes. I hate it when people won't tell you.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	yep, happened a couple of years ago with a friend I had known since we were like 7 or 8 she just blew up at me and claimed all these things that really weren't true at all. And to this day I don't even know what set her off, made her so mad, and try and say these things to me. We didn't talk for 6 or 7 months after that. I can tell it'll probably happen again and soon, she's getting annoyed/pissed off at stupid small stuff so I'm staying out of her way for awhile, maybe a month or two.    and oh yeah she wouldn't even admit that she was mad and blaming me for stuff but she was yelling *rolls eyes*|`|yB3Jek85aa	yes|`|AnIgXRcJaa	Some times, but I usually find out what I did later on lol|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	I have an uncanny knack for that.

I feel bad for her son.|`|AA11514493	Honestly...  That does absolutely nothing for me.  and I mean.. nothing.|`|AROX6og0aa	It should be a state law that all women get bewbies like that.    |`|2089c2125bd52f479e8785a63e67137daa	i have enough trouble keeping up with the wife's 44DD's, KKK's might kill ME! :))|`|BMYOukx5aa	duh|`|7m34rQs5aa	Absolutely disgusting.

vkIqaFQ1aa	I think so, yes. I live on the edge of a town and would love to get even further away!!!

The snakes were the hardest things to get used to. And the skunks. And the scorpions. *shudder*    =[|`|wEbB1FuNaa	Yes of course. You need to prepare for never knowing what the weather is going to be like unless you are going to live in the country in california or texas. But if your going to a place like Kansas, Nebraska, or Oklahoma then you will never know what the weather is going to be like. Country life is homey and wonderful but you can still have fun with the local party life.|`|fx6pNJ5saa	I had a friend who moved from Chicago to here (The Sticks).  He had never had any pets so he bought two rabbits.  He didn't understand why a couple of months later he had 150 rabbits.

I had four myself and loved them all. But if I was gonna be a dog, I'd be a German Shephard. Those dogs are the most loyal, kind, strong, and protective dogs in the world if you treat them right, and if you train them better.

5NKa5Y8laa	I  often deliberately cook more than enough, so there are leftovers for lunch next day, or freeze for dinner another night when I get home late and cant be bothered cooking.      My favourite...curry (chicken, beef, lamb, fish or pumpkin, I love them all) and rice... yummm.    Curry always tastes better the next day.|`|JBcpBn5Gaa	Pizza, Cold.    And I eat it for Breakfast : )|`|1hiImyBdaa	Yes-I do.Curry.|`|JSl1jAPQaa	I don't eat any leftovers.|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	I eat every left over ....    fav is meatloaf|`|MM8rqTMtaa	Yepper.  Meatloaf and mashed potatoes.|`|xQwmHlU6aa	yup, all the time!  my fav is any type of chinese food|`|I1OojsB5aa	I very, very rarely cook so there's never any leftovers to be had.    Cold pizza is da bomb though, cold thai noodles are pretty awesome too.|`|wZD9KJaFaa	Leftover pizza the next day, cold too.  Or chicken cutlets.  Leftovers are so good.|`|6Nmly1wmaa	I never eat leftovers!
t69aptZYaa	?|`|Qagl7o1Haa	Unfortunately...    I have Never Been In A Starbucks...lol.    xD.|`|JPDxyTT3aa	dunkin donuts.     seriously starbucks sucks so bad. i hope they go out.     charging 7 dollars for a large cup of burnt coffee is sad.    and the empty shells of people that buy it to look cool are lame.|`|kGTzG6VLaa	I have a Keurig (which I REALLY recommend) and their coffees are overall really good.  Right now I'm drinking Green Mountain Coffee Co. Golden French Toast (delish!)|`|r3o10XbAaa	no kidding starbucks isn't on top.  duh.  thats because now that people feel poor, they don't want to spend 4-7 dollars on some pathetic cup of coffee. especially if they're in debt or something...
XlzMnbg5aa	yeah some spend hours just to gain points to go up levels
AtM1l8Bwaa	NO they love him and are wayyyyyyyyyyy too biased|`|2ReFiNAqaa	that is the media's job to bias up the story to make the guy look believable.  I think they are doing a good job because he is young and I prefer young Presidents to old retiree's.      Republican's next time get a young person into the race so you guys have a chance.  That old guy McCain could not live up to the expectations of Obama because Obama is young, which encourages the young people of America to vote which in the past hardly any of them did by recent polls.|`|42XdLpgvaa	The media does hates Obama.So does almost all the American politicians.I can only hope he will be able to 'stay' and do his job without being overthrown or something.|`|8FOMXuqpaa	Nope, just America haters...|`|eQBOR6vGaa	its obvious they dont...|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	NO  They hated McCalin/Palin|`|DdIFC5k0aa	the media is in the tank for obama. plus obama is nothing like any of those three people you mentioned.

QEtuVeHSaa	I would like to make a shout out to my cat, Meatball! I LOVE YOU MEATBALL!!!!!! Lol
4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	the cadbury chocolate advert, i knew it was about that as soon as i saw the question. lol    dont think they really have to advertise the chocolate anymore, everyone knows what to expect.    it's like the gorilla one last time, nothing to do with chocolate or cadburys!    the faciel movements are done by CGI.|`|AA11997207	The idea of an advert is to get people talking about it. It matters not if it is to do with chocolate providing the name is becomes apparant. They have succeeded people are talking about it on Yahoo.|`|2flqUgcDaa	My Kids love it. I think it is very odd. What has it to do with chocolate?  Done by computer though.|`|6bc8356604557667c776ceb4e4a5935aaa	it really is erie i thought it was for some horror movie when i first saw it|`|GPrw1JZkaa	Its very clever indeed|`|C4FsBeGNaa	i think they made the children do a few diff faces/eyebrow shapes etc but obv the computer does the rest. its a fairly pointless ad but it does what its meant to do ...people are talking about it and remember it!|`|eBHQBeF7aa	A bit silly, but it's kinda fun.
P69Ob0eeaa	In school :( I'm watching it snow outside and hoping I'll be sent home! :)  x|`|j6RbKNmjaa	At home|`|9iNCQkWlaa	roflmao....te he te he... are you gonna let a little snow stop you...fact is you're all over the news here in Canada. get out and challenge yourself it's great fun!  Think of it as an IKEA day...in that Snowmen come from the sky unassembled|`|V4eh2yfcaa	College is shut. But i still have a driving lesson in the snow!!|`|3LPTLUczaa	I am at work, it is raining in London :(|`|TZiySTOGaa	we aint got any snow here at all :( i live in carlisle on the england/scotland border.... my kids were really hoping for snow again but nothing not even a flake lol.,... i hope we have some more the kids will love it!!|`|f2c691cb03d9d6b21303d0a416f0ad3daa	Im at home no school today birmingham (UK)|`|2dJIJr6uaa	i'm at work :(|`|sbmzMVLraa	I am at college in Scotland and it is snowing a little bit here but not as much as on monday.|`|H93JbQS0aa	:((( Me at work why!!!!!!!!

g3yfUOjQaa	You obviously need lots of attention|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	UR A SLUT!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fkYQN5Xuaa	absolutely not thats perfectly fine and acceptable (almost) everyone in ireland does it and losing your virginity isnt such a big deal over here go to nightclubs get drunk have fun but also be careful:)|`|TqSGFIFUaa	I think your first time should be special, not with a random guy you hook up with because you are young and drunk.  I think getting drunk at 17 is highly irresponsible.  I am only 25 and I made mistakes when I was younger.  If you are going to be that young and get drunk, I wouldn't do it at a nightclub.  There are so many bad people out to hurt you so if you get too drunk and someone takes advantage of your state, you could get really hurt.|`|AA12383908	I don't think you are thinking very smart. Think about your future 1st and sex later.|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	yea thats what we call sluts and whores here..or attention-seeking sluts and whores would work too. get a life, when you end up getting pregnant your gonna come here asking a question "OMG! I'm so scared im pregnant! how do i tell my parents? what do i do" blah blah so typical..dont forget about STD's, stupid kid...just worry about school dang.|`|Qzn1cungaa	i think you should wait untill your marriend or in a very serious relatinship and getting drunk is bad to|`|AA10598858	Yes. You're underaged, first of all. Second, why would you waste your life on something like that? You planned when to lose your virginity? That's a bit creepy and something that you shouldn't be planning. Worry about school and your career, not sex.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	Well it's illegal and could cause a lot of trouble for both you and the nightclub workers.. and they have a new rule, I don't remember what it's called but someone on answers was talking about it, if you look under 25 they will card you. but.. your choice to try those things I guess.. you shouldn't put a time limit on when you will lose your virginity.. hopefully by the time you turn 16 and 17 you have matured|`|CApnEZ83aa	Yes, I think it is wrong to lose your virginity to someone that you are not married to.  I also think that it is wrong to go to nightclubs and get drunk.  If you get caught, you could get into a lot of trouble.  You are underage.|`|IPpr8Hnlaa	Nope im 17 and do that all the time i have been doing it since i was 15 and before that i got drunk in parks and houseparties from 13 +  however i am still a virgin and think that you should only really loose your virginity with someone you love and think your gonna be with for a while but some people don't really think sex is sucha big deal so ya know each to their own xD|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Why 16? Theres plenty of time, I waited til I was 18.|`|a4993552752cc787c811fe933d03022daa	yes.  theres nothing constructive, productive, positive about what your doing.  why behave like most other peers do?    I assume you use fake identification to enter the premises of bars and clubs, considering your under 18 or 21 (USA)|`|2vUOqAikaa	Is this supposed to be some sort of joke? You can not be serious in this question. If you are serious then I would tell you to not proceed on this course of action. You should not be going out to clubs at 17  and getting drink. That can of behavior can get a person killed or raped. And having in-responsible sex, may bring un wanted pregnancies and s.t.d.s. Though it would appear that any pregnancy you might incur, wouldn't be unwanted.|`|lCvKauNEaa	beauty?    ...|`|D1iHwbtxaa	i'm laughing|`|Xnmkdim0aa	YES. don't do it. my cousin got pregnant at 19 and is having a hard time so far, but its getting better because now she is almost done collage and doesn't work at a movie theater and got a real job. and an apartment she would have done it sooner but the baby came. SO DO NOT GET PREGNANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|liup711gaa	Yes that is wrong. I lost my virginity when I was 15 with a guy that I didn't even really like. I don't regret many things in life, but I do regret that. Believe me, once you find the guy that you love and you want to be with for the rest of your life, you are going to regret losing your v-card so fast and in such a stupid way. Please just wait.  Drinking is stupid...especially when the goal is to get wasted. Wait until you are 21...it will be funner if you wait. But I would tell anyone that drinking to get drunk is one of the stupidest things ever thought of...no matter how old you are.   I can't tell you what to do, but I hope you listen to my advice, I really have a bit of experiance on this topic. Good luck mate!

Just 'because', which is ridiculous.|`|bMeUnE4daa	yea sometimes there is no reason,|`|dgGtwSIzaa	* Yeah , It sucks - they used to do that to me now I just hate everyone for no reason ... Until I get to know them ;o) *|`|zEp6xHacaa	that just shows their lack of maturity, for me to hate someone they have to do something to warrant it|`|IizPFrELaa	Oh there's always a REASON|`|NY2fpmvPaa	Yes, same here. BUT...it was because I was a partying drunk whore. Even if I didn't have interaction with them...they all knew it. lol.    But, luckily when you get out of high school that stuff doesnt' matter anymore. Now that I'm married, I'm too tired to be a whore.|`|537b873668b83aa721d2aa3b05dd78c0aa	yes...I can just look at someone and tell I'm not going to like this person and I'm always right.|`|f2113b05e02ebfbd153f0941dfa190fdaa	Yes, unfortunately I have had that happen. I have met people who from the first minute they spoke, I couldn't stand them. I know it's wrong, but what are you suppose to do when you just don't like someone? I have also had this happen, and then got to know the person, and became very good friends with them. So, I guess we should always give everyone a chance, even if we think they are total morons...lol.|`|snjdyvlmaa	No, there is always going to be a reason.|`|Qy9nZgBhaa	I try not to be like that.  But when people act like that to me, I just smile and be as nice as I can to them.  It seems to piss them off a little.

She wears her outfit's so tight that there's no room to sag. her body is shaped like a beach ball supported by stilt's and she thinks she is to good to wear those Hawaii style moo-moo's. think about it this way if you take two of the same balls and stuff a flat ball into a blown up ball when you blow up that second ball it will have wrinkles in it however because it fit's so tightly you will not see a sag in the material.

FnxgmknUaa	YES !!!! Definately.     Then even if you do manage to get back to sleep you wont be able to return to the dream. Its sad.

I always want to know what happens in the end but NO! =P|`|AA10044154	That happened to me the other night.

Don't dream anymore|`|d71b03b8b99817fe775b11b0cbd633e9aa	Yea... and then I try to dream about it the next day but nothing happens. I wonder why that happens right before the good part?|`|oN92aOUraa	Hi   Yes i hate when i am in the middle of a good hot dream and i wake up just as im about to kiss or something. It totally blew me away and it suxs andi cant call or text her either.|`|AA11633500	who doesn't?|`|ynUU5sGNaa	Yes, it's really disappointing...

I was going to 'finish' it, and my alarm woke me up!!!!|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	Lol for the category.|`|RR1gNkS2aa	yeah because you want it to be true but whenyou wait up u know that it will most likely willn't be true|`|vkhQz16Laa	True, sometimes i would go to the best parts of my dreams and i will have to wake up for school. It's also depressing when i think my dream is real. Like once i dreamt that i had all these new clothes and stuff. Then i woke up and i was so dissapointed. lol     ;D|`|zIMlCnVsaa	Yes I hate when that happens!|`|FwJLD1uDaa	i know :(     have you ever tasted food in your dreams? i had a minty chocolate from a floating seafoam-green genie once in my dream. that was the first time for me.. i do hate waking up right before something totally awesome happens!!!|`|MPba9IUBaa	yesssssssssss  it makes me angry|`|R7smL5mQaa	OMG yes it happens to me so much and its so frustrating when I can't have that dream again lol.    Btw awesome pic!! I love Twilight!|`|Q9MBZZMcaa	yess!!!  i hate that  expecially when im already in a grouchy mood cause i know i gotta wake up for school haha  yea not pretty:]]]|`|lz26T6A6aa	Oh my god. I hate that. And I try to go back to sleep but it doesn't work!!  ugh.|`|osoTq2dcaa	i really hate that to it drive me crazy  !|`|STumBiU0aa	yes  once i woke up in the middle of a dream of being uh orally pleasured on a small row boat in the middle of a lake at sunset.  sigh. I wonder if humans are masochists at heart since we often wake up just before the good part|`|hvde0uHNaa	yeh it pisses me off... sometimes i continue the dream in my head while awake ... = D|`|a6UuiDMWaa	Yes there is nothing more worse|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	yes.  most of the time, i don't even dream after that.|`|DiBAWKPsaa	Too many times, too annoying.   x|`|4E2FYEHsaa	Oh yes, I get that almost every day! So irritating...|`|jxm3yEHRaa	yes i hate that too|`|spXPpyP0aa	oh ya|`|4wHjtkJXaa	Yea that ALWAYS happens. You ALWAYS  wake up at the best parts.
7Z3NKbrjaa	yes, you could live w/o your cellphone...                                      why?                                                                                        because it does not do anything special to some one except for communication and there is a phone you could always replace the cellphone with....  and think about what others do....like  you see others just throw their cellphones even if it has no damage at all....      so for me my answer is  YES..                                                          now if you mind I will be watching Fate/Stay Night so...... see yah later!!|`|DyT1Kyi4aa	before i can live without it since my perception about it is ITS JUST FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TEXTMATES. And i rarely go out of the house then so i don't need that to have communication....    but now i feel incomplete without it because i use it to take random pictures... i love photography so much that i use my Nokia 6680 for taking pictures of any kind.. and somehow i know now how to value it    i also use it to have communication with my mom wherever i go... i now go out of the house most of the time..    : )|`|thcr8Y5vaa	No...|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	hell yes|`|MRwb4jQYaa	I have since Christmas day, and I'm still breathing.|`|dk8y4eseaa	Yes. What an unrealistic society we've come to.. the problems of luxuries get deeper and deeper when suddenly you end up with a big hole, where you can't get yourself out and wished to have back the real necessities in life.|`|AA11276628	No.  I have 2 cell phones. The first one I have for 7 years by now - since I am 16 and the second one I have from work - for 3 years.   I need it so I can reach my husband whenever I need on the spot, for urgent questions at work. Also I live in a country which has terrorist attacks once in a while (Israel) and I need to be able to be reached/reached my beloved immediately and check that all is ok.   Also my calender is in my phone, and I feel like a part of my life is in the cell phone    I remember the first time I lost my cell phone, I felt so lost and missing part of myself...|`|YTQGKzuqaa	Yes I could :)|`|6wljdQ9kaa	probably i'd go mad, i have everything i want on it|`|c78mAitdaa	Technically Yes i can live without it, because i won't die the next day without it.     But on the other hand, i need my phone not just for chatting, using it in emergency would be helpful. Without phones in general the police don't know your in danger... For emergency purposes i couldn't live without it...     :)|`|mu94enaVaa	mine broke yesterday and i only got it at christmas!!! :( it was $200 i thought it would atleast last me a year ahhh i wana check my text messages im going crazyyyy|`|sWCWrvi2aa	No i would go crazy without it.|`|w4LKvr0daa	yeah, as long as you don't take away my laptop too...|`|9xgGd9praa	Yes, but not being able to find out what people are doing exactly at that moment would be a bit bothersome after a while.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	I'm going to go with no. I wouldn't have any other phone, so no.|`|Cb6aKYuWaa	Yes.    It would rather be a bliss to stay with yourself without any disturbances. Mine rings a lot.|`|ZuD07BKNaa	Hell NO!! Its my whole life! My means of communication! I broke my old phone and didnt have one for like 2 days, and I thought I was going to die!!!|`|dWAB9cLbaa	oh trust me i'd live.i love may life waaaaaaaaayy  more than a cell phone.i'd just be pretty upset for  a while but soon enough get over it.
aeb8a97e18cfb4ff7d90a5aa9ca2331faa	The best movie is kind of a hard thing to pick since his movies are informative on many different subjects.  An eye opening one is Fahrenheit 911 to really understand what went on in the Bush White House during 911 and the ties to oil that this country truly has.  It also shows what an inept leader Bush really was and exposes a lot of things that the government doesn't want the citizens to know.  He is working on a sequel to this film now.  That should be really interesting.    All of his movies are eye opening experiences though so it's hard to pick a favorite.  Bowling for Columbine takes on the people that are pro guns and the religious right, that one stirred up a lot of controversy and if you are in the mood to see how GM "cares" about the American people then Roger and Me would be up your alley.    Each one of his movies exposes some element of "secrets" that are kept from the American people to keep them from really understanding what is going on.  While I don't believe all of the items presented, he really makes a good case to at least explore another opinion outside of the current biased media reports.       You really wouldn't go wrong picking up any of the films I mentioned above but if you haven't seen Fahrenheit 911 you might want to start there.|`|eCGg94HJaa	Haha, the first 2 answers are typical of right wing Americans. They just can't stomach any criticism of their deeply flawed nation, so anyone who raises criticisms (even if they are valid and justified) must be anti-American. What a load of bollocks.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	The only one I really liked was "Roger & Me".  "Bowling For Columbine" was just so-so.|`|nJwSUv8vaa	HAHAHA!!!  Openly Straight if I was at a level 2 I would definitely give you a thumbs UP for that answer.    I agree completely ;)|`|POJNnWhDaa	that's like asking which pile of dog **** lying on the sidewalk I like best. it's all ****.    You got better than links, you got my opinion. You asked what I thought of his films, I told you. Just in an unusual way. What more do you want?    I'll ignore your butchered spelling.. "What's the BEST MOVIE directed/shot by Michael Moore?"   So you asked which of his movies is the best. And I told you, one smelly lump of **** is the same as all the others to me. There is no best.    LOL typical liberal reaction.. you lost the argument, so you resort to placing blame and insults. wow. Well, you enjoy yourself in your little world of anger and hate! See if you can dream up some more stuff to blame on America, it's very amusing! And it sure beats taking responsibility.
19nQDjEmaa	I would ignore them as they have low self esteem!|`|27OUtdOeaa	sure, but I dont waste my time with this kind of people!  just ignore them!
iVC63zypaa	You have a Pole? Is she hot?|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Are you talking about the North or South pole and why do you describe them as "your pole"?|`|Mfe6r2khaa	let them suck it for a fiver then do in the *** for free|`|186deac21531919b3fa042717df297e7aa	could be Trip , why don't  you asked them xxx|`|ZxJ2BK2naa	Some people have such a provocative attitude!  hehe   You guessed right, Trip!|`|QGuxbItCaa	A gun will work fine.|`|PlbC2xQhaa	pole?|`|jkXYlKJzaa	i think ure right and if they deny it then tht just means they want to play hard to get|`|NH5htkAyaa	only if its a greasy pole :)|`|QEQmMZycaa	I think that's a safe bet!|`|XS0ltAYaaa	They love to hate you.|`|812xWV0naa	sorry i didnt get the pole part ?|`|Kaj4WqPjaa	Pole?    hmmm probably more of a twig then a pole|`|UUKWOWhnaa	I think it's a sure sign of frustration. Let them have it Trip, you dirty smelly f*cker!!        Hold on a minute are you keeping a Polish person as a sex slave?|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	I think it is. Smelly :p|`|CvtDsOB4aa	pfft I Won't Even Give   Them The Time of the Day|`|FBwK9s7Baa	you start avoiding and stop reacting then person will feel the same question and will come to you for the answer for sure|`|PSFc7sE4aa	yeah it is|`|6ik7OJRNaa	Should YOU ask such a thing, Trip dear??.....  ....This is elementary!!.....  It is the most clear sign of genuine adoration and extreme desire to spend their time on you pole.....    ....wish I were constantly rude, but.... I can't!.... LOL     xx|`|UgNHBJ3Jaa	what you mean like a boy /girl play ground thing ....oh for sure she just wants a little attention lol :)  unless they really do hate you and have become like a hate filled stalker that wants to break your pole oooo :(|`|yU2WHyvgaa	shut up you stupid tennis player!|`|olSoKaioaa	Only if you are deluded.|`|6e2191f96a837588ddf197c3f002bc49aa	I have a very good metal baseball bat that works well for this.

khnMoQNoaa	im single trip and never been married but i have been in long term relationships and being single is a million times better|`|tg4K6bIYaa	single|`|h6wDmUMWaa	SINGLE BCOZ THEN U HAVE FREEDOM TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO!|`|euDzDijUaa	i am engaed and loving it!|`|ZNr4o1EEaa	never been married but being single has its benefit's|`|MuAHhGi1aa	BEiN' SiNGAL.. CAUSE U DON'T GOTTA WORRY ABOUT BEiN' FAiTHFULL OR NOT..|`|U41ZnhJ4aa	well that depends on your age, who your married too and what you do for fun =D|`|892YhtPCaa	i am single, want to be married,   but not to you coz you look gay|`|JjpSrQBsaa	90% of these answers are going to be biased.     Most of the singles are going to say being single is better    Most of the married folks are going to say they enjoy being married.    Im engaged and very happy. My best mate is single and very happy.|`|Z0CwQf4Haa	I'm single.  i guess after i get married it wouldn't be as fun as being single but it wouldn;t be a bad idea at all.|`|AA11641349	Married, I love being married.  No more playing be perfect games. No more running all over the place for the "potential" of a nice evening, no more worrying about is he going to like me, what should I wear, will he pay attention to me or will he be looking for something better while we're out.  It's nice knowing he's going to be there when I get home and when I wake up in the morning.  If I'm tired, we'll order out dinner.  It's great sitting and watching a movie curled up on the sofa at home next to the man I love.  It's great being able to share your life with someone.  It's great knowing I'm spending  the rest of my days with a man who loves me for who I am.|`|HudU1sMCaa	Of course most people may say there are benefits to both, but I have never been happier then I am now. I have been married for three years and I'm not looking back. I believe the   1 thing is to find the right person for you. After all my relationship experience I never thought It was possible to work so flawlessly with another. People settle so often. Not for a bad person, but for someone who just doesn't mesh well with them. Slow down and allow time for the lord to work in your life.|`|nXOawSbCaa	Never been married, but I suppose it depends on who youre married to as to whether or not its enjoyable...    ...was engaged and the vaginal sex rocked    I dont mind being singleI can do what/whoever the hell I want...enjoyable.|`|AA11297232	Like most married couples i will say being single when i feel unhappy and sad and being married when i feel happy and contented. At the moment i wish i was single.|`|8DsbSALzaa	m single and in relationship its better,no its best|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Marriage     I am married and happy|`|NY2fpmvPaa	I am married, 3 years :)    Feels like I've been married 10 minutes.......................under water.    J/K. I love my husband, we are best friends and I enjoy his company. There are times when I think I should have waited and lived the single life for a couple years more, but I don't think I could live without him.    Plus...I'm such a weirdo I'm glad I married when I did. No one is quite like my husband, and he likes me for me. Guys usually just see my face (well, boobs first then face) and then they get to know me and I'm a real nerd and really like video games and stuff.|`|UgNHBJ3Jaa	upside of being single- being able to do what you like and not answer to anyone  downside- not having someone to share the good things with    i never been married and it is not something i would enter into lightly a husband is for life not just for xmas , birthdays, valentines day and holidays is what i do know (shame that) so in my opinion marriage would only be more enjoyable if you were ready and not settling for something just in fear of being alone :)|`|wmBK9uASaa	For me being married...been married nearly 10 years and no regrets.|`|6k5fhFyBaa	Single--I was married a few years back, and I was miserable.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	Marriage- you get to hang out with your best friend a lot more.|`|2Hqb8lmjaa	Single, and i did not enjoy being married! x|`|P8uh4joQaa	I didn't like being single. I hated having to sleep alone and having to try to find somebody that I actually liked. I'm engaged now and I love every minute of it.|`|TvMiwKjEaa	I guess being single means that you have a lot of freedom but it can also lead to loneliness. Whereas you have to be committed when you're married but at least you have someone to enjoy spending time together with and things like that.    I'm seventeen so I'm not married. But I'm currently in a long-term relationship which has lasted over three years.|`|nuLroEjraa	depends on what you're looking for.  if you don't mind being committed to just one person, then marriage may be for you.  if you like the freedom of dating who you want, then maybe singleness is the best route.  i'm single.|`|ipqWxJyGaa	It`s not all black & white. Both have pros and cons. I`m married.|`|yM7YPmzSaa	Never married but had a very long relationship.    I like being in a relationship and I like being single.....both have their pros and cons|`|I9TGCtvEaa	i am married and it is more enjoyable...|`|wBVuFu3Baa	I'm married thanks and I really enjoy it.  It's full of challenges and fun and the best adventure you could ever have!!|`|hrsyPUwTaa	Being drunk is the best...|`|iVC63zypaa	I'm not bloody marrying you Trip ... just get over it.    edit ~ I don't know which is more enjoyable ... I've never been married.|`|9cd51d4c661adc7fafd62eeb1902520aaa	single because i get options and iam free dont have to anser to anyone. but i do want to get married someday but now iam happy just being single|`|dgGtwSIzaa	* Trip , Im in a relationship that feels like marriage ... so  I'd pick Single any day ... *|`|9eBruYtqaa	i am married and i find it more enjoyable than being single...i loved my life when i was single, but i'm much more content now!|`|VEXKm1Obaa	    Single is much more enjoyable but I do miss being able to share everything with someone.|`|dqCTS60raa	Sigle  I think sigle is much better because you don't have as many responsabilities.|`|TuGkVqwraa	Being Married is good.     I am not yet married.   In marriage life there is sharing of thoughts, works etc.     Better for timepassing.|`|CApnEZ83aa	Marriage is enjoyable.  You have someone there all the time.  I am married and I like it.|`|MLKNTEEvaa	Oh God! I was right!     *goes out to look for a big feather hat to wear on Trip's wedding*|`|NcNxIsynaa	I have been married since I was 19 I have no idea what it is like to be a single adult.......so I have to go with being married is more enjoyable|`|m6jE5KVUaa	I was married once....I like being single for now, I have more time to do things with my son and when he is not here I know how things will be...I like having some  one on the side, but not someone that thinks they can come whenever they want and try and take things over...If I could find someone that actually knew what team work and decision making on both sides meant then I might consider it again...but so far I enjoy my life...I have 2 dogs, a and a  horse, when my son is here we have the best of times, when he is not I have plenty to keep my busy, besides when I was married I did all the cooking and cleaning and yard work anyway... Don't get me wrong with the RIGHT person I think it can be a great thing...so if she comes along don't let her get away...trust me you will know...because she wont let you get away either...|`|PMQWI1Ojaa	I am currently carrying on several relationships of the sexual sort.  My husband is cool tho, he just hangs out in the closet....watching.      So, definitely marriage.  Best of both worlds|`|MFSGWYKzaa	Both have their perks.....  I was married, it ended horribly........need I say more.....    ?|`|KPFBbi06aa	I was engaged for many years and enjoyed it but have never got married cos i haven't felt ready to make that step yet....i find being single is more enjoyable cos i like to be a free agent and come and go as i please i supppose i am selfish and love the fact that if i see a guy i like i can do something about whereas in a marriage i would have to remain faithful to one guy

jHDeIPEfaa	The others are ignorant liberals that try to push their agenda onto everybody. Elisabeth is totally correct in stating that people that are against animal cruelty think it's okay to abort babies. Maybe they are truly jack***es and they are against animal cruelty because they want to protect their own species. They sure don't act human.|`|AA12390047	I wish Elisabeth would reach across the table and grab Joy by the throat and slap her silly.    A gnat has more intelligence than Joy.|`|POHWTDPRaa	She does get ganged up on a lot but she brings a lot of it on herself. Elisabeth is very immature. There have been many times when she has defended and excused X Republican for something but criticized X Democrat for doing the exact same thing, for no other apparent reason than that it happened to that certain party. She doesn't think beyond 'Republican good. Democrat bad.' It's like she's afraid to form her own opinion. No one ever agrees 100% with everything their preferred party does. Except Bitsy! She seems to think that anything else somehow makes her a bad supporter, less of a Republican. Very childish. It's hard to take someone like that seriously.    And honestly, right now you are acting as ridiculous as she does. You asked if anyone agreed with you and the people who don't are being attacked and told they are wrong. It seems that her co-hosts are not the only people who need reminding to accept that there are viewpoints other than their own.|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I dont think she get ganged up on, I think she asks for it.  She is just like a typical ignorant blonde bimbo politician.  She can never answer a question straight.  She is always changing the subject and making comparaisons that dont make sense.  I think she likes to get everyone else rawled up to make it look like she is being picked on then she goes and plays that poor pitiful me act.  Sometimes she does have some good opinions and views but she screws them up by talking about them.  I think she is about as brilliant as Sarah Palin blonde and just as ugly!|`|C46DNX11aa	I can't stand Elizabeth and if I were on the show I would treat her the same way. She acts like she is so perfect and that everyone else is mean.She is a conniving little devil. I thought she was leaving the show, I was hoping that she would.And now I hear that she is pregnant AGAIN, What does this make, about a hundred. Someone needs to get theIR tubes tied and fast!!!!! If she cares so much about abortions, why don't she volunteer to adopt all of the babies and quick having them in herds herself.|`|W9B6EJrWaa	She's like a female Jerry Springer.  That shrill shrieking ear-splitting voice of hers.  She just gets higher and higher and higher.  Dogs around the world cringe and howl when she speaks.      Come to think of it, dogs aren't the only ones..........|`|w2oUA8zqaa	Then you are not paying attention.  She talks over them as much as she gets talked over.  And if you watch with a little distance, you will see that it is only Joy that argues the same way Elizabeth tries to, with volume.    Whoopi & Barbara try to gently make Elizabeth see that there are other valid points of view.  Shari hasn't really picked a side, & just tries to get her own point of view across.    In my personal opinion, both Joy & Elizabeth are guilty of "willful ignorance."  They find only those facts that support their own point of view & tend to ignore all others.    You are welcome to disagree, but please try to remember that there are always other points of view, and many of them are just a s valid as yours....|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	No she's just ignorant and not able to carry on an intelligent debate. The others are sick and tired of her drivel.  WTF was she doing comparing the killing of wolves to abortion??  She's an embarrassment and the others were trying to keep the topic on TOPIC not go random to abortion rights   Joy asked if we could focus on animals right now. Elisabeth asked if it was a socialist table now and she should be able to talk about what she should be able to make the leap if she wanted to. Joy said that it would be easier if we just focus on the animals. Elisabeth said that you want to focus on what you want to focus on. Then they went to commercial.    After the commercial, Sherri said that the PSA is only about animals. Elisabeth said that she sees it as the protection of life in general.    So how can anyone have a discussion with someone who says "I wanna talk about what I wanna talk about" ?? and if she didn't get her way, she calls them "socialists" -- come on!|`|FoWUSPK0aa	Yes deary. She is being ganged up on. Elisabeth Hasselbeck is a strong person because no matter how much criticism she gets she still doesn't back down. All these wack job liberals on here need to get a life. And they need to be slapped silly!|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	she deserves most of what she gets.  She too talks over others, and is argumentative.|`|uD1S5dYtaa	Yup, everyody's so dumb except for Elizabeth and the Pecker.|`|50d942fb9cb02a07ad994afcd5ea15fdaa	She is an absolute airhead & does not belong on TV just because she was on Survivor. She interrupts everyone on every subject & she does not know what she is talking about. Best part of her being PG again she'll be off on leave after she has this kid & won't have to listen to her dumb remarks.  If she feels like she's being ganged up on so much why doesn't she just go home with her broad & suck her thumb.|`|UOmhBNxKaa	the other women on the view are not interested in hearing any ones opinions, other than their own.  and if anyone says anything they don't like, they talk over them, belittle them and don't let them get a word in.  they do this to many of their guests, as well as elisabeth.  i appreciate that they also have their own opinions but they need to let others speak once in awhile.  and, although i don't always agree with elisabeth, they do treat her shabbily, especially joy.
IFf5r9zAaa	It depends what they've done. A lot of rappers come from tough environments so there are some things that I don't judge them for. Not that I'm saying it's ok to go about selling crack or whatever, but it's cool that they've managed to get out of that and do something positive.     Big Pun, yes, that bothers me. I mean, he pistol whipped his wife over nothing. I've never been that big a fan, but it does put me off listening to his music.     And I never listen to SPM. Messing with kids is just a no no, I don't care who you are.     For the most part, if it's just some character flaws, it makes no difference to me. But if they've done something I think is pretty evil, like the two I mentioned, then it's unlikely I'll support them.    The one that really bothers me is Tupac's sexual assault conviction. Nobody ever talks about it. People tend to just say he must have been innocent but can never say why other than "Pac would never do that".   He denied any involvement in it at all, then when he got out of jail admitted that he knew what was happening to the girl but did nothing. Makes me wonder how innocent he really was considering the way he changed his story once he got out.|`|ELwysDcVaa	of course..i used to like Akon til i found out he never was locked up very long or even a criminal for that matter...he mainly commited petty theft....rick ross was a fed and rappin bout coke...and big pun abusing his wife...it suks but u gota have a respect for the one rapper that talks bout smackin hoes and actualy doin it.......|`|LkRP4OKaaa	Ther experiences are what"most of the time" make their ryhmes good  but when it comes to bein a PEDopHILE Yeah it would change my veiw of them but if I like a song Iike a song fr what it is not what the rapper has done.|`|v7hTlEkCaa	When I didn't know a lot about hip-hop I used to like Jay-Z, when I started to follow hip-hop though Nas became my favorite rapper, and because of their feud I did not like Jay-Z anymore. Eventually I listened to his older albums and now I could say that listening to some of Jay's songs is a guilty pleasure of mine. I still think Nas > Jay-Z though.    Kanye West is also someone I used to have respect for, but he is pretty ignorant at times (ex: Soulja Boy is as good as Nas). Plus I don't like that auto-tune **** that he's getting into.|`|T0NDsPsgaa	Not at all.... All the rappers lie about things anyways....     Rap glorfies bad behavior, so listen to rap means you should expect & accept that.|`|gUYcVXMTaa	@ New Moon you say rambling but i understand and felt you on each word!!    I guess it all depends I dont condone R Kelly's action (I am mommy of two girls) but he does know how to write the hell out of a song.  Daddy Yankee (Yeah Im spanish so what LOL) I used to really like but once I found out he was a strong McCain support I looked at him in a new light.  And when I read about Nas and his wife trying to pick up that prostitute (shakes head) I was let down!  But still got his album though.  So it all depends!!|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	I would be lying if I said no. I am with you on R. Kelly. Despite his undeniable songwriting abilities, the fact that he did what he did, turns me off.   However, I know that bias plays a part. Brandy is partially responsible for vehicular manslaughter. I still support her. I don't know why.   In terms of Hip Hip, I think I'd be even more biased. If Talib Kweli got arrested for soliciting a prostitute, I'd probably still support him.   But if he was arrested for selling drugs, probably not.  So, I guess it depends on my perception of the issue at hand.   Rambling...    @Yup: I think you and I were separated at birth...I felt the same way about Daddy Yankee..wtf?|`|cPcDii15aa	possibly    if it's something that matters to me like that ...     it also depends on if dey rapped about it too, like it wuz kool.    Nah, i wldnt support a hypocritical artiste

1SKN7SoDaa	It's late. You're home alone. You hear something creepy, You're too scared to move. Suddenly, you hear the large wooden door creak open and a freezing cold blast of the night air rushes in. Behind the door is a looming, spooky shadow. I cover you face with a pillow from the sofa, peeking slightly from behind it; my eyes darted everywhere trying to see if I could grab something. The shadow moved closer.   Quick as lightning, the it towered over me, and I saw something eeirly shiny, glint in the dull moonlight. The shadow; strange as it seemed, opened it's eyes....  I screamed, my peircing voice rattling throught the dead silent darkness of the night.     After that night; no one saw dear Lucy again; except for the sometimes ghostly scream at night.         I know it wasn't funny; but at least I made you jump.... ;)|`|qWELS6N2aa	lmao (my contacts will know this) you look behind you and see your hand- then you start screaming hysterically because you thought it was another persons|`|7cei5ifNaa	u need to move u are getting laid ....xx

And that how you learn!!|`|e41w1Cmuaa	Yep. If you didn't make a decision at all, then you would be lazy, and it's good to try. Take the risk, life's too short! Live every second like it's your last one!|`|ZDFP11leaa	No. A bad decision can cause more harm than making no decision at all. Just my personal opinion|`|601769880381ed0f6423429080479dccaa	Definitely!  I can't stand someone that can't make a decision to save his/her own life.  I mean, c'mon...Jump in, take the chance, and fix it later IF it needs fixing!|`|OhuWMW9Gaa	NO. Making a bad decision feels awful and can stay with you for the rest of your life.  However, if you chose not to make a decision you can always believe that had you made one, It would have been the wrong one..so thank your lucky stars that you didn't!     A flawed and inaccurate way to measure the outcomes of decisions, granted, but sometimes it's all about the power of 'mind over matter'.    And yes, I am a risk taker and I always make decisons myself.|`|tFGMfDthaa	I think that when you make a decision (whether good or bad) you learn from it. None of us are perfect and we won't always make good decisions. Learn from it and move on. Don't dwell on it. It won't do any good.|`|frwlypDWaa	Sometimes.

Yesterday a group of us got together and began to discuss controversial topics.  and although it seemed like a rant at first it became a good discussion.  We all assume that everyone knows what makes us tick and what someone means with the hidden messages we leave however we forget that people go through different scenarios and so different words and alliterations can mean different things for people.  it could be something simple as laughing at the wrong time, for one person it's getting a joke late for another person it's implying someone said the wrong thing. All in all I don't think people think beyond their own skin for the most part.

cqpctVWbaa	I can remember being at my great-great grandmothers house a few times. I only remember the outside and the kitchen though. It was that 1950's green. You know the one. lol. She died before I was 3, if I remember correctly, so I was probably like 2 or 2-1/2.  I think I actually remembered where abouts in town she lived too just based on how the front of the house looked.    Also, I remember where and what I was doing when my dad asked me if I minded having a little sister.  I remember asking about the toy I was playing with a couple years ago and they said it must have been around my third birthday.  Plus she was born 7-1/2 months after my 3rd bday so I guess that's about right.    Also, my aunt lived with us for like 6 months to a year right before my little sister was born, but before that she lived with her first husband.  And I remember going to their house a few times.  So I had to of been 2 at that point.|`|SPQdFOwKaa	I remember we had a really fluffy cat named Spike that I liked to cuddle while watching cartoons and eating cookies.|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	I almost hit someone while driving this morning.|`|XDfrSfrvaa	i can remember being conceived|`|RzhbINzeaa	birthday party at 3.|`|SeKR3zncaa	The day my brother was born, waiting in the hospital with sausage and flapjacks from McDonalds.

But so anyway I remember I was 2 years old and I was in my grandparents log home by the beach and I remember i was sitting on a wooden chair with a miniture wooden desk and i had a pen, they gave me a pink sheet of paper and I stared at it for not even a minute and I drew a nice scribble lol! My mom and everyone were so proud|`|mC8iwbVCaa	hitting my little brother with my dolls when i was like 3.|`|bl8co4hUaa	Two memories are from about the time I was 2 years old. The first is being drawn to my older sister's acoustic guitar, which was leaning against a wall. I reached out to touch it in fascination and knocked it off balance. I tried to run, but couldn't fast enough, and it fell and cracked me on the head.    Second memory was at Christmas. My mother put a realistic baby doll in a cradle under the tree (for me), and I remember being really unsure because I thought it might be real, and I approached it very apprehensively.  *L*  The guitar incident happened first.

VUqlQmJcaa	I gotta say that basing someones interest level based off of their gender is tough, I think people are overrated, they have huge ego's (myself included sometimes) can be stubborn and terribly impatient. But when you find that special someone from the opposite gender things can be wonderful.|`|73A0T8ltaa	"Foolish hoe" is a typical thought that goes through my mind. Followed by sick laughter.|`|rqiXZk87aa	no wayy i find the same sex overrated ;]|`|snzDn1Nhaa	NO. absolutely not. however, if i were a woman i would think so.|`|lRklcZtBaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	YES!!! some girls obsess UGLY DUDES for example the jonas brothers. they have there posters every where and everything. guys aren't even good looking. girls have no body hair, curves, no facial hair and we're not over rated enough.|`|mggll8dRaa	Not Really...!!|`|upvd5TRRaa	yeppers|`|AA10838250	not always|`|qHEpR92Gaa	no.|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	men, oh so very yes!!!!!|`|14gi4aTvaa	Sometimes but not really. A lot of girls at my school look like plastic barbie dolls and they act SO fake. It's annoying. Those type of girls are overrated.    I love natural and more original girls [:|`|5jqfKDdfaa	At times, but where would i be without boys?|`|fdalc5Rcaa	no not at all ....|`|bBHlGs5waa	Yes. Some women are just beautiful on the outside.|`|RP5NnxgUaa	Sometimes.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	nahhhhhhhhhhhhh boys are way tooo overrated and of course girls are going to be liked girls shave their bodys, do their hair to look gooooooooood but guys dont do anything so why should girls like thme..|`|ZPTmbQW4aa	Men......... No MEN are not over rated but as people in society of America SEX period is OVER RATED... Sex SALES so I keep hearing but don't other things sell as well.... That is the only thing I hate its like SEX is all we FOCUS on rather it be in the movies, on the radio, in the music videos or even out at the club... Its all about SEX SEX SEX...|`|2WFzTTAzaa	Sure.  But I think that's also true of the same sex.|`|UIzaamJ7aa	Nah...Guys are awesome!|`|KyxvvvDXaa	Sometimes|`|hIrBZS3oaa	No no no.    I love the opposite sex. A girl just can't do somethings all by herself.|`|BMYOukx5aa	Yes, men are highly over rated and have absolutely no clue|`|clqgFUFFaa	nop, that a gay thing to say|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	A bit.

fYZBfCcUaa	Any time a girl gives me strong eye contact I always say (with confidence and not 100% serious) "you are not allowed to look at me like that and just not say anything." just make sure u have a big smile on ur face when u say it. :)|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I just pull down my pants and say "Looky looky I got cookie"|`|2ynZARB4aa	yesterday, i wrote my number on a piece of paper, made eye contact with the guy i wanted, beckoned him over with one finger, he ran over and i put the piece of paper in his hand.   he was in shock, mouth to the floor lol it felt wonderful. he txt me soon after lol  BUT i don't think i like him after all ha ha|`|3956c292d9898cc425bc25b7923184b7aa	Go ask her out!
5gqc5qyzaa	I love driving on the snow and ice. I just pull over and let the impatient people overtake and hopefully they'll go flying into a tree down the road a bit.|`|sbuNcsIwaa	i agree with you that people are crazy with road rage and will still push at you in snow when you are clearly trying to be acautious, however snow is my favorit condition to drive in because i can, when noboday is around their is nothing more fun than drifting around corners with your handbreak|`|7ciw1aCXaa	It's about trust. I always think "trust the person in front, they might be able to see things that you can't, they might have different abilities than you".    And at the same time  "I do not trust ANYONE else on the road. Look out for number 1, expect the unexpected, don't get complacent."    I try to stay cool, but it's hard sometimes when I stick to the rules and other people don't and worse if other people hassle me for sticking to the rules. They're there for a reason.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I like to drive 20 mph in the snow and ice, no faster than that, it was snowing the other day and this guy passed me on a road that has double lines (you are not aloud to pass) and there was another car coming from the other way, what a big fat DB that guy was, I honked at him and flipped him off, lol|`|9RgjqTeuaa	I drive slow and carefully on the snow/ice.  I have found that the people who are driving fast and passing everyone are usually the ones who you will see in the ditch five minutes later.  You were smart not to let the driver behind you bully you into going faster.|`|a4993552752cc787c811fe933d03022daa	No, snow can fall where I live or not far away.  As I live not far from a very small mountain that is: 1270 metres.    I don't think driving in the snow or ice is safe.  As you need grip on the road of course.    I don't know if all or most vehicles, whether newer or older can use snow chains or not.  Although those snow chains may only, be able to be used, on alpine roads.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	I get mad if your just being stupid my horn will tell you|`|JbRTKDFmaa	I'm from New England so you bet your butt I can drive in the snow and ice. You have to learn to be able to survive around here. I take my time with it. If someone with an SUV who thinks that just because they have no problem going that they can go faster (sure they've got no problem GOING, it's the STOPPING that's the issue!) they should climb up my @$$ and try to force me to move faster, I get out of the way. I drive a civic, it's not that great in the snow. So when people get like that I just pull over to the side of the road and let them pass.|`|IizPFrELaa	Heck no, I respect the fact that most Iowan's are not able to manuver the snow and ice we get.    I get around just fine with my 4x4|`|zEp6xHacaa	sure, sideways|`|4f8d8369ef1509758bf98e8adc3d5af2aa	i can drive through anything  like it was a sunny day|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	No I am not skilled enough to drive in hazardous conditions.|`|iVC63zypaa	I can ... but it makes my heart race.|`|etA9BX5gaa	when ever some one is behind me like that, i wish i had millions of dollars, so i could slam on my brakes and have them crash their car into mine. ...hate those people....|`|6of3tqHhaa	yeah i can, but i dont like it|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I can drive on the snow and ice but try to avoid it if I can. The last feeling I have is rage, I am thankful when I reach my destination, and thankful for everyone who drives slowly and cautiously.|`|TZiySTOGaa	i dont drive in the ice and snow becuase i dont trust my self being able to control the car if something were to happen.... however i have had to a couple of times and did really well! but it was late at night and no other traffic around lol.... (i was on my way home and was caught in a freak blizzard we were not expecting lol) i do suffer road rage but not in bad weather conditions and i always keep my distance in frosty weather and rain|`|nFakIvgoaa	I live in the South (Alabama) where everything shuts down on those rare, rare occasions when it snows and/or the roads ice over, so I have zero experience driving in snow/ice but I imagine it would be nerve-wracking!|`|GKH8n3xzaa	Not really    I slipped twice...so everytime i do drive in it...i freak out|`|70OHpjySaa	Yes, I can say I can drive in snow/ice condition because I never ended up in a ditch so far.  But I do it very slowly with great caution and apprehension because I'm not used to it, because I live in a warmer state so I would only do that on a skiing vacation.    I try to just ignore the moron behind me who thinks I'm too slow. I put my own safety above his concern.|`|dKHX3SAqaa	why yes, yes i can|`|QcbgIBghaa	i get those people all the time, they expect me to move over so they can pass, i just keep going the way i am|`|AA11523465	I can, but it scares the crap out of me.

nimIHwXeaa	No, I don't.    I told my son that I will get my first tatoo when and if he graduates from an IVY league school or medical school.|`|LDSL0DUiaa	No...  Honestly, I think tatoos are gross|`|IHa6FxE6aa	No.    Tip: Be as specific and detailed as you can. Use any personal experience or knowledge you might have.    You can use research to help support your answer.|`|u3xDS7i8aa	no|`|AA11518036	No l don't.|`|94PHAJw9aa	a picture of Baphomet on my right arm.  and "Hail Azerate" on the left|`|1FWYRIchaa	On women I like it|`|jeZmqhNcaa	No but I want one|`|Xxn7DssEaa	no and no|`|bW6NpTXdaa	no and yes|`|sQGYh6Wfaa	no i don't  on men a few|`|fk8wXA3Saa	Yes 3 of them and i do like women with tattoo's like Kat Von D.|`|w4LKvr0daa	I have many.      I love them on everyone.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	I haven't gotten one yet.  I like them on other people providing that they are well done.|`|T3W4Mf50aa	2...butterfly and fairy  yes i like tats on men|`|a1690b511affe4c905562c831f314954aa	No, since I was in the Marines I was tempted many times to get one.  But when one Marine tried to get a tattoo of a scorpion.  It turned out to look more like a green lobster.  So I decided to be safe and avoid the chance of getting a bad tattoo.|`|zgT2rB0zaa	I have a tattoo of a little heart on my back. I'm only 17 so nothing big. I'll probably get more in the future. I do like tattoos on men.|`|RugUki9qaa	5 of them. One says "FREEDOM" one says "BEAUTY" and the other is my husbands name on my behind. The other two are designs.|`|AA12036375	Yes. I have 2. One is Mickey Mouse and the other is the Chinese symbol for love.|`|jJ7TWJ2Xaa	no dun want any it hurts ...................duh|`|fOr37xtfaa	not yet.. but when i do I'm gonna get a huge tribal thing on my arm/shoulder/chest|`|LpDQsHpJaa	no but i want 1.|`|goM4NtsEaa	i dont have a tattoo  i dont want one also|`|rMdGGBauaa	no, i want one though, i will say "this is tough but i am tougher" thats my motto|`|PvwZdLuLaa	No, I don't. If I were ever going to get one (and I'm not) I would get a little butterfly on my lower back. I like tattoos on men better. If a girl gets a big tattoo or a sleeve it makes her look hard. A guy looks sexy.|`|1a837cf5274e28b6f67b09c94f14b623aa	yes i do, small rose, I like them as long as they are conservative|`|AA11230418	No|`|qtRa9T1Naa	no and i dont care|`|oDMEYSKjaa	If the tattoo is done right and has a story to tell, its wonderful.   I have two. The one on my leg is a treble clef with bass signs and sharp signs around it. Why? Because when I was younger, I didnt have much friends to hang around because I wasn't the popular kid. So I went to my room one day and played with the keyboard my sister's friend gave to my sister. While other kids were outside, doing nothing productive, I was in my room, teaching myself to play music and to forget about my worries.   The other one is of a dragon holding a lotus flower. Why? My chinese astrology is a dragon. I strongly use the chinese astrology. It has been so acurate in my life, its incredible. The lotus flower holds a very deep meaning in my life. I have Psoriasis and was incredibly bad when I was younger, hence the music and no friends. So when I grew up, it hasn't really affected me like it did when I was young. I still get a bit ashamed and what not, but not as bad. But I have accepted it and now moving on. When the lotus flower is young, it starts out in the bottom of the pond. Which is the grossest/ugliest part of it. Then when its growing, it sprouts into this beautiful flower. I like to think of myself as a lotus flower.     Tattoos are like art. Its so awesome to just look at some of them and listen to there stories on why they got it. I new a friend that got a bat on his back because his father and him were drunk trying to get a bat out of the house and his father fell down the stairs and they both pissed themselves from laughing. Tattoos like that are awesome and art. People who just get a tattoo just because it was pretty and cool looking are just abusing it. Making it a trashy thing, like the tramp stamp.     And I have posted a novel basically...lmao|`|VkXQq2y2aa	I have a lightening bolt on my right wristttt.|`|OBW7N4KKaa	na looks bad|`|auYMj9EXaa	no|`|mXO2TOUjaa	yes on my ankle and I am female, just a small crescent and a half moon. I love tattoos not so much on girls but on guys it's a turn on for me|`|wi37WScSaa	i have one right now on each wrist and one on my foot and ankle ;D
tLI94qWNaa	I couldn't agree more with you on all the ones you listed, you rock for listing them.  When I saw your question those are the ones that  I was going to list:D lol  Some other ones on my list of badass characters are:    Jigsaw (Saw)  Riddick (Pitch black, chronicles of riddick)   Gaspard Ulliel as young Hannibal (Hannibal rising)  Woo-jin Lee (oldboy)    But if I were to pick from your list, Hannibal wins my vote.  No mans eyes are as deep and petrifying as Anthony Hopkins eyes in silence of the lambs.|`|D27mJKmWaa	Hannibal Lecter... And the Joker. Both great!      Also...Victor from Underworld!!|`|IG8s8UnSaa	No one tops Dirty Harry.|`|rVnTnuU1aa	I would have to say Hannibal Lecter. His character was way out there and what makes him truly scary is that his character could really reassemble a real life person.     Another bad character that i would add to list is Jigsaw from saw.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Anton Chigurh|`|zetxxZWUaa	The Joker and Anton Chigurh definately, hands down.|`|SdTQVUaKaa	Toss up, jigsaw and Hannibal...|`|av8aKGvqaa	GOTTA BE ANTON CHIGURGH    HES AWESOMEE!!|`|vLzLk4m0aa	imma go with the Joker!!!  totally bad ***!|`|VI7phxR7aa	Marvin from Sin City!!|`|k4gxs7a3aa	Joker (Dark Knight)|`|b9wICW1Paa	I would say in recent memory it would be Kroenen from Hellboy.

Anton Chigurh - I haven't seen No Country for Old Men yet, but I'm getting to it.  Joker - I think it was a good way for Heath Ledger to "go out" if ya know what I mean. Nobody could've played that part any better and that movie rocked!!! The joker was creepy and freakish, so in my opinio Joker.  Harry Callahan - Never seen Dirty Harry (I don't think).      So THE JOKER :).|`|WPoK3i5Daa	definitely JIGSAW off of SAW|`|bjmDAjnpaa	TYLER DURDEN!!

You gotta SPEND when you're in a recession and SAVE when you're doing good so that you have money when things go in the crapper.

VyAJNIqKaa	i think you need more information than that.
alpymXfCaa	The wife, Charlize Theron, has super powers just like Hancock.  They were pairs. There were more of them.  But when they get together they become weaker and become mortal because they fall for one another.  The others died because they stayed together.  Her and him were the last two.     He didn't remember her because when they were together the last time he got hit in the head really hard and so she left him.  He found her again and she wanted him to go away so that she can have her life with her then Husband who is trying to get good PR for Hancock.      That was the twist, he wasn't the only one of his kind.  His name is John Hancock because the nurse asked him to give his John Hancock so he thought that was his real name.....it wasn't.    ---it is a good movie.  Enjoyed it.|`|JxPR1MfFaa	I personally didn't like the movie, it was dissapointing                      :SPOILER:  Charlize Tharon (Mary Embrey) turns out to be Hancocks kind...when they get close they become mortal, when they're not close, they are immortal...sorta gay!|`|o1ocfvM9aa	that he is not the only super hero  and that he has a wife who married someone else|`|Zrg7sNYRaa	Theron is also a super being.  They were created in pairs and she used to be his wife.|`|GwwcqUCoaa	Thanks for asking... I'm wondering too. And I knew as soon as I saw your question, it was about Hancock.|`|a1pmr73vaa	Also, there are no plot holes concerning their powers, why they were designed the way they were (we simply didn't get a concrete explanation. They don't have to spoon-feed you every bit of backstory/mythology, some can be left open to interpretation). What Charlize Theron's character did give us was enough to go on.     They're not for sure angels or gods, Mary's explanation seemed to imply that that's simply how humans throughout history have viewed them/wrapped their heads around them. I don't know why people are so dense that they're taking that part literally. Maybe Mary, John, and the others like them inspired people's beliefs in the supernatural (no actual gods or God, but these superbeings, aliens, or whatever they were turned out to be the basis for those beliefs, or at least the visuals that accompanied those beliefs). Also, if she knew for sure where they came from, how they were made, whether they were born to human parents originally or began life some other way, we aren't told. But you'd think she'd include that crucial bit of info in her explanations, so it should be assumed that she doesn't know. Either that, or it was so far back and their beginnings were so abstract that she simply doesn't understand how they got there/what they are.     This movie has better acting than your average superhero flick (yes, everyone in Iron Man rocked as well). However, it isn't a traditional superhero film and Mary and John arguably aren't even really superheroes in the traditional sense.    Fanboys guilting on Mary for not using her powers for good, and/or for leaving the just-brain-damaged amnesiac John alone 80 years ago--she's 3000 years old, she's entitled to some happiness and normalcy if she wants it. Don't give me any of that "With great power comes great responsibility" crap, it might work in the comics and in the Spider-Man films but it wouldn't be applicable or realistic if these sorts of people really existed. She more than likely helped humanity throughout the centuries more than a few times, she's fulfilled any perceived obligation to our species. She's old, she wants a break. It's not fair to expect these beings to exist in eternal servitude to mankind.     Interesting side-note I hadn't thought of after seeing the film--without Hancock near, she would never have grown old. So she either would have had to come clean with Ray at some point, or found a way to break it off with him eventually. Each a potentially heartbreaking scenario. Though Ray was such a nice guy, I imagine he would've found a way to deal with the fact that he would grow old and die and she would outlive him and his son. Perhaps in the 80 years she went without Hancock, she lived through and ended more than a few marriages. Either that or she spent decades rediscovering herself.     The comedy of the first half of the film was fun, and the loneliness of Hancock in the trailer scene in between some of that worked nicely (I took him at his word when he told Ray he was the only one too--didn't suspect that another superbeing would be showing up, except for maybe a technology-enhanced villain to challenge him, but I'm happy they didn't go that typical route). However, I don't understand the movie critics going ape$h!t over the tonal shift and seeing many folks on the IMDB either hating on the movie for it or saying they were disappointed. People complain and complain about wanting something new or surprising, not predictable, and then when they get a film that's relatively well-made that turns in an interesting direction.    Criticisms of "why did they need to have a big dumb fight, why didn't Mary and Hancock just talk it out"...she was frustrated, she'd thought she was rid of him (for a while anyway--she probably didn't believe it was permanent, not if they're immortal and almost certainly would've ran into eachother again eventually). She clearly doesn't hate him, the movie plainly shows that...but if you think of them like two ex-lovers who departed on okay terms but one doesn't really want to have much to do with the other anymore...yeah, I can see her frustration. Also, she believed in him as a hero and likely didn't want to see him get hurt again. Even without a big frustrated/angry fight, the end result would've been the same--her pushing him away to preserve him as a superhero.     The entire hospital tragedy scene was wrenching. I give a whole lotta credit to Charlize Theron for playing the pain beautifully, for Will Smith doing his thing during the action scenes and especially bringing it when he was struggling to run, stumble, and eventually fly so she would live. I don't think the movie really became about some eternal romance in the end, that was just backstory. He couldn't remember loving her, so he wasn't doing it for that, he was doing it because, as she said, the hero thing is ingrained in him. He was saving another life. And he cares about Ray and his family and didn't want Ray to lose his wife.|`|0BokF6ceaa	he meets a girl that is just like him, she is married to the guy trying to help him, and is also Hancock's wife because they are created in pairs.|`|QgbD4lEPaa	Well he is not the only superhero, he has a wife, who is now married to someone else.    the someone else is also his very good friend. When he gets close to his wife they both lose their powers so they have to stay apart:)    its a good film btw

aace84e7b64d8b838579364f0fecfa63aa	All I gotta say is "Thank Goodness for my DVR!!!" I just didn't have the patience to sit around for 2 hours to watch Blaine, so I fast forward it to the last part. I got to it and my girlfriend and I were left with Dumbfounded looks. We were like what happened? They should have said look at Blaine bungee jump and be hoisted up by cables into the air. We sat there rewound it 3 or 4 times and we felt bad for the folks who sat through this for 2 hours waiting on this. I do admit the last minute before this bungee jump was exciting, but what happened ummm...... If I was at the park, I would be booing mercifully and you wanna know something, I think I did hear some booing at the end of the thing. The MC of the event, sounded like he didn't know what to say and had to ad lib what happened. He made it sound like that when Blaine was lifted up out of the Camera's Sight, that was the big surprise. HOW LAME!!!! Yack!!!!  I really wanted to give this guy a Chance, I had my suspicions on him and I guess my suspicions were right on!|`|RltRoENqaa	Well, he probably thought it was incredible to do that, but it's not.

bb5e7e2013f001f52c989dc5d8402748aa	You mentioned that you had therapy, but that you tried really hard and concentrated when you were there.  When you get out in the real world it is harder to maintain because you have so many things going on.  The good news, is that you can make your speech sounds when you are focused on them.  It just needs to become more automatic and rote for you.  If I were you, I would journal about your speech each day - writing about what /s/ words I said well and which ones needed work each day, practicing both the GOOD and the not so good words in front of the mirror, focusing on a few key /s/ words each day (like a word of the day type of thing).  I would also record myself and listen to the playback whenever possible.  Awareness and practice are KEY in my opinion.  YOU CAN DO IT!  :)|`|fyp9PVwnaa	ok matey i have a slight lisp and sang for years at school [not in a band just solo ,did exams and all] ...the one thing i always noticed was when i was singing i never had my lisp ....it seems the vocal techniques used actually stopped the th sounds and made it all sound correct .......in a metal band [ i am guessing you'll be singing in a kurt cobain / korn style vocal ].....i would assume your lisp would be alot less apparent .....if you'd like to chat feel free to im me   good luck and belt it out proudly  have a good one

vFFgHI9Kaa	they've probably taken it off because the sales figures for the actual magazine are so low.  And that's the main reason people buy it - for reviews. It certainly isn't for the 'groundbreaking' news stories they publish or the latest 'Keane' interview.
wUFJJWKraa	This is an abstract from a paper that I think will do your project wonders:    http://journals.cambridge.org/action/dis...    It's about Finnish government regulation on music and rock and what not. But out there, it would be easier to talk about the Tango. It's freaking massive in Finland! Everybody does the tango. Sort of odd when you know anything about Finnish behavior and culture.

COMPLETELY AVOID anything by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, such as:  Rick Astley, Mel 'n' Kim, Jason Donovan, Kylie Minogue, Donna Summer.    b.       ABSOLUTELY GO FOR anything that was produced by Trevor Horn such as:  Frankie goes to Hollywood, Propaganda, Grace Jones etc.    c.      Also there is The Art of Noise, Killing Joke, The Mission, Sisters of Mercy, even Duran Duran and Visage are passable.

It's in season one, and Rachel's just reunited with friends of hers from before she left Barry at the alter.

"I haven't used my card in months, what could be the problem?"    "That is the problem, they want to know if you're okay."    "Am I okay? They want to know if I'm okay? Well, all of my friends are either getting married, or getting pregnant, or getting promoted, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay then you can tell them that I'm okay, okay?"|`|lNqSx1znaa	Falling Down is a movie about frustration--there are several good scenes.

hqQ8YfNdaa	actually, novels are better than movies. i just prefer movies more because im visual|`|14533cc4696a0ba7f60e883e8f54979baa	The reason movies are better than novels is, it takes a lot less time to watch a movie, than read a book.  Not to mention, no reading (unless you go to a foreign film, but if you do that, you might as well read the book).|`|5f6e442be489c34dc5385bd2ce8c9d58aa	Because the movie has better CG graphics and more imaginative with full of action, compare to novel. Plus some of us have poor imagination so we can only think what we can figure out.|`|c7cc47caa2e1c32be30d5984593bb674aa	NO!  I think the novels usually are much better because of very details.  Movies just help you using the imaginations or something that.  Guess you are not into the books in any way.|`|6Gm7TFQ4aa	The real reason that a novel trumps a movie is because reading a novel is a single, personal experience. You direct the scenes as they most appeal to you, and you bring the characters on the pages alive in your own mind. It's a specific experience tailored to you and you alone.     Rarely does a movie ever come close to emulating what you perceived in your mind when reading the book. |`|GYvzf50naa	I believe that movies are just like the book/novel but with talking and more action. Plus,when you read the book/novel after you watch the movie,you see that everything you saw in the movie is not included in the book/novel.|`|9a1ef84e9784f037726c1edbbce2c426aa	novels tend to drag.  it seems the thicker the book, the happier authors are.  most of it is overdescriptive crap.|`|0gr6DyUAaa	they're not  novels are so much better than movies|`|NQ7KlRtbaa	The book is always better then the movie.

Plantei o melhor que sabia, no  que a vida me havia dado chance de plantar e regar.  Hoje vejo flores, rvores, plantas, pios de passarinhos, algumas ervas  daninhas, que quando aparecem tento extirpar.  O quadro pintado por mim,  bonito, de pincis diversos, mil matizes.  N?o valeu a pena? Valeu sim! Talvez para muitos n?o seja uma obra de arte, mas o  para mim.  Foi o melhor que pude fazer.  Leia, meu amigo:    SEMEAR...      Quem planta rvores, colhe alimento.     Quem semeia flores, colhe perfume.     Quem semeia o trigo, colhe o p?o.     Quem planta amor, colhe amizade.     Quem semeia alegria, colhe felicidade.     Quem planta a vida, colhe milagres.     Quem semeia a verdade, colhe confian?a.     Quem planta f, colhe a certeza.     Quem semeia carinho, colhe gratid?o.     No entanto, h quem prefira,     semear tristeza e colher desconsolo,     plantar discrdia e colher solid?o,     semear vento e colher tempestade,     plantar ira e colher desafeto,     semear descaso e colher um adeus,     plantar injusti?a e colher abandono.     Somos semeadores conscientes,     espalhamos diariamente     milh?es de sementes     ao nosso redor.     Que possamos escolher     sempre as melhores,     para que, ao recebermos     a ddiva da colheita farta,     tenhamos apenas motivos para agradecer.    Eu semeei o que de melhor sabia.

Md0XccoPaa	I kinda think Teen Spirit is a little too...  anthem-y, anymore. And not in a good way.  Not in the way Kurt would've liked. :/    In Bloom would be ironic.   Since it's kind of about not understanding anything, brainwashing.  But, that in itsself is a bit brain-washy.    I would go for In Bloom.    rip Kurt!  [I stay home from school every Kurt-day. :] ]|`|vELxMTbYaa	curt was a coward so in my opinion id play     Lamb Of God 11th Hour  http://www.metrolyrics.com/11th-hour-lyr...|`|FiMmHlnKaa	in bloom is good or about a girl|`|bWK1eRe3aa	Happy Birthday|`|EQm2iCpaaa	I like " The Man Who Sold The World"  It's a great cover.|`|MmbLWe3Qaa	Smells Like Teen Spirit, so even the most tasteless kids will get it.

The school would really enjoy that :D  or Pennyroyal Tea. That song just sticks in your head.|`|VLZhY2ZKaa	i don't think he liked Smells like teen spirit that much, it was the song that made him famous, and he didn't like that..    one of my favorite songs are "lake of fire" but that's not very appropriate, so maybe  "lithium" or "come as you are" people must recognize that, right?|`|Vu4A83dyaa	I would say Smells Like Teen Spirit or Lithium, those are my two favorite songs by Nirvana.

8ZcGDTzOaa	For a major label (in US & UK), you have to sell at least 5 million albums to make $1 million.  If you sell 1 million albums, you might become middle class.  Less than 1 million and you are still poor.    It is different if you sell the albums yourself.  If you can sell even 200,000 records without a label expenses, you can be a millionaire easily.    This is why bands must tour and sell t-shirts constantly.|`|GkqUtke4aa	there isnt much money in album sales anymore, most of the money comes from touring.|`|vwm0lPcWaa	1 album can makes artist rich.  An artist income based on:  - Royalty for every CD sold, a 600.000 copy sold, with 2 USD royalty per copy will be 1.200.000 USD  - Royalty for video clips  - Live performance or tour show  - Advertisement or product sponsorship  - Bonus for award or top selling album, and re-mastering their song|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	Depends on your definition of rich.

She was really singing though.|`|t8O81I2kaa	I don't think it was. If it was, Jennifer wouldn't even be there! I mean, she would go out in public for the first time since her mom and brother were murdered and just to sing a recorded song? Maybe Faith Hill's was, but I don't think Jennifer's was.
OYYYNCyCaa	yes it is       Hotel California will always be a great song       long live The Eagles|`|JzYlcuXzaa	Absolutely, top 5 favorite songs of mine.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	The music for Hotel California probably comes from the song "We Used To Know" - by Jethro Tull.  The Eagles toured with Jethro Tull just before they came out with their song.  See:    http://youtube.com/watch?v=EgO7MamJnqM    The song is credited as being written by Don Felder, Don Henley and Glenn Frey.  It was released in 1976 by the Eagles.    There are many fantastic ideas about the meaning of the lyrics of the song.  These theories usually pick one or two isolated items from the entire song.  Almost all songs tell a story, and as such all of the lyrics should contribute to the whole.  Hotel California is no different.    The meaning of the lyrics are that the song is a description of the journey from Need to Love and Marriage to Divorce and ultimately to the impossibility of regaining the life and happiness of the pre-divorce state.     Initially the traveler is feeling the need of a relationship My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night.  The traveler meets his love and gets married There she stood in the doorway.  I heard the mission bell.  A marriage commitment opens up the possibility of happiness but, also, the traveler is aware that he is vulnerable to the possibility of intense unhappiness.  And I was thinking to myself, this could be heaven or this could be hell.    Unfortunately the marriage dissolves and his former love becomes obsessed with money Her mind is Tiffany-twisted where Tiffany refers to the very expensive New York Store, Tiffany & Co..  With the divorce there is the division of property- she got the Mercedes Benz.  After the breakup when he sees her with any guys she reassures him that the pretty, pretty boys are just friends.  In this new world of being single the other singles he meets do their dance in the courtyard. of life.  They generally fall into one or the other of two groups.  There are those who cant stop talking about their Ex. Some dance to remember and there are those who dont want to say anything at all about their past marriage some dance to forget.      Now in this world of being divorced he longs to return the pre-divorced state of happiness So I called up the captain, please bring me my wine but he finds that his happiness (wine) is now irrevocably in the past we havent had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine.     Deep into the post-divorce singles scene with mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice he is reminded that it is his actions that got him into the prison of being divorced, we are all just prisoners here, of our own device.  And, yet, he and others want this divorce nightmare to be over, so- they stab it with their steely knives, but they cant become pre-divorced, they just cant kill the beast.  Now frustrated he panics and is, running for the door.  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before.  But he is brought up short when the night man informs him that You can checkout any time you like, (commit suicide) but you can never leave (become pre-divorced).    There are two choruses in the song and each mention the Hotel California.  This reference is to the environment in California around the time the song was written.  California was experiencing the highest divorce rate in the nation.   Each chorus has lines that remember his past marriage such a lovely place and his past lover such a lovely face.  The first chorus indicates that there can always be more divorces Plenty of room at the Hotel California, any time of year, you can find it here.  The second chorus points out that, as a part of divorce, you will always bring your alibis    For a really good rendition see:    http://youtube.com/watch?v=HAM1g0oX4OE|`|V20PTwMmaa	no|`|7rb2F3TJaa	No not really its too reggaeish|`|EQm2iCpaaa	I don't know if I'd call it Epic.  It is definitely a Classic.  I think an epic song has to be over 10 minutes long.|`|BN5nW4rZaa	it is very epic|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Agreed, definitely one that can stand on it's own with Stairway to Heaven.|`|Na7aCxUgaa	Hi     Yes I would call it an Epic song      Steve|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	It is a good song.

It's an article with a good website link list of places to watch free movies. You can watch old movie classics or new releases. They have a foreign movie list too.      I like this article because the websites on the list don't have 50 million pop-ups and you're not require to register or install something useless (like Zango) before you can watch a movie.  Saves me a lot of hassle of going through a lot of crappy sites to find some gems.    This list is all you'll need since most of these free movie websites out there get their movies from the same sources.    Enjoy!    Peter

A lot of people do that.   Plus it might give you ideas for creating your own music, :)|`|WzoJhFb9aa	well, with today's metal especially, the lyrics dont need to go with the songs, just yell louder than everyone else and your golden.  If you mean the classic metal, like maiden, find a good melody for your progression and...just sing to it.

MMjeIP2xaa	The nut is glued in, so you need to break the seal on the glue. Take the strings off and tap it firmly with a mallet, using a block of wood.  You will also need to reverse the bridge.  It is usually better to get a new blank nut fitted and get it cut with fresh slots.   Best thing is take your guitar to a luthier (guitar maker) or guitar technician and ask them to do it - it shouldn't cost much and they won't wreck your guitar!|`|ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	It isn't that simple. The nut is held in by glue. A small piece of wood and a mallet will usually break it loose, but you may not be able to reuse the nut. Also, the bridge will have to be changed. It too is set up for right handed play.|`|85a3fa1820e8d16aae0d775bc9e86f25aa	take it to a luthier|`|QQbbReRAaa	The Hendrix look hey?. I'd take it to a guitar tech. They have to knock/chisel it out and glue a new one back in. Probably a job for a pro. Not sure what glue you would use either.
qcxeM6scaa	the mosh is fine. they can get rough in the breakdowns or whatever you want to call them. you will get pushed around and that's expected, but people will help you if you fall or something|`|0k2fkt4Yaa	yeah, they're pretty rough.  As long as you're not in for too long you'll be okay though.  Watch out for jerks who start swinging fists. Its about pushing, shoving, and ramming, not throwing punches.  For the most part people will help you up, so it's cool if you get pushed around some.  Hope this helps.|`|6EaFBoe4aa	hey,  Im 13 and i've just been to see BMTH on the Kerrang! relentless tour.  Their their the only reason that i went.    The mosh pits are rough but if you dont want to be involved you can go and stand farther away.  The mosh pits are all part of the excitement in my opinion.    People push, shove jump and a few people throw fists around.  But if you fall their will be someone who will help you up.  It happened to me    Half of the crowd fell when i went to see them but everyone grabbed onto each other and helped each other up.    They also do circle pits and a wall of death.  These are rough and i wouldnt suggest joining a circle pit unless your gonna be able to keep up  But you can just stand a bit farther back for the wall of death    But its really fun and i would say go for it    :)    Hope that helped    love  x|`|96d3cb3498d8a4437901f14555d9cd3aaa	Yeah they're rough.  But not the worst.  I think you'd be okay if you knew what you were doing.  But if you've never moshed before, I wouldn't suggest it.  But hey, do what you want.    And like they said, if you fell someone would help you up.  I think you'd be alright.

Y3qHZlQBaa	I'm not too fond of her music. I like heavier stuff. My sister is like a pinkahaulic. She loves her. She has every cd and tons of posters hanging up in her room.|`|zVAIyOd7aa	I do she sexy|`|tlj3c50Haa	Yep, I love her. She's not my favourite artist, but I think she's really good. I have a lot of respect for her, too. I know she is a completely mainstream pop artist, but she's still doing her own thing, and has her own look, instead of getting by just by looking like Britney Spears or Rihanna or someone. She's still pretty though.     I didn't like her first album, that Take Me Home, but since then she has got better and better, I'm Not Dead is my favourite so far but Funhouse is awesome too.   I couldn't choose a favourite song, I don't think, lol. :)|`|McN2I1E6aa	I like blue myself!|`|oIIiMY5Zaa	No    Black is my favourite colour|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	pink...   we're gonna see a lot more of them in the next 4 years...

I have all 5 of her CD's...I love her attitude & her style...not to mention her beautiful voice, & she's also quite beautiful herself....    I like all of her video's, but I would have to say my favorite video is also "So What" because it shows her sense of humor, & personality, & shows that she is a strong, good woman to have her Ex Husband Carey Hart in the video, & remain friends with him....The video just gives you a "so what, I can do this" feeling, & I like that...    Some of my favorite songs by her are:    -"You Make Me Sick"  -"Private Show"  -"There You Go"  -"Just Like A Pill"  -"Numb"  -"Oh My God"  -"Love Song"  -"Who Knew"  -"Cuz I Can"  -"U + Ur Hand"  -"So What"  -"I Don't Believe You"  -"Please Don't Leave Me"  -"Funhouse"    |`|rOqAlGJwaa	Yeah, i think she is great too! my favorite video is stupid girls.

g8TJfVvFaa	As a whole there are 13 members in Super Junior.  Due to so many members, SM Entertainment, the company they are under, decided to split them up into sub-groups when they not busy with activities as a group.     SM first sub-group was KRY standing for Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung, the three Super Junior members.  They were chosen because they are the best singers out of the entire group and KRY mainly sings ballands and softer songs.  Their songs also aims more to older people.    Next, Super Junior T and the T stands for trot, an old form of Korean pop that had recently died down.  Lee So Man, creator of SM, decided to try and bring it back with this sub-group.  This group has Leeteuk, Heechul, Kangin, Shindong, Sungmin, and Eunhyuk.      Then they created Super Junior Happy.  Their main goal was just to release songs that bring happiness thus Super Junior Happy.  This group has Leeteuk, Kangin, Yesung, Sungmin, and Eunhyuk.  Pretty much the same as T except Heechul is replaced with Yesung.      Last, Super Junior M was created, also called Super Junior Mandarin.  They were created to have Super Junior be more known in China.  This group is the only group that has two new members that are not actually part of Super Junior, Zhoumi and Henry.  The two are only Super Junior M, not Super Junior.  The rest of the members are from Super Junior being Hankyung, Donghae, Siwon, Ryeowook, and Kyuhyun.      I personally thing that all these sub-groups gets way too confusing and keeps the group separated too often.  I believe that the main reason for it is money.  Currently, Super Junior are recording their 3rd album and are expected to release it sometime in March.  By then all sub-group activities should stop and all of Super Junior should come back together to promote their new album.      Some are doing their own thing too.  Heechul and Kangin are currently in the variety show Bands of Brothers.  Heechul is also in the variety show Becoming Good Daddies.  Kangin is also in We Got Married.  He also recently released a movie called Pure Comic.  Hankyung is filming a movie in China.  There's also a lot of other stuff like promotions and things like that that are happening with the group.|`|ljJUFo8Aaa	They're just sub-groups made up of members of Super Junior, they just perform different styles of music. Super Junior is still a group all together, they just broke it into smaller groups as well to get more fans, possibly.  Super Junior M - they perform for the chinese audience/they sing in mandarin.  Super Junior T- they perform Trot music  Super Junior Happy- haha the name says it all they perform happy music  Super Junior K.R.Y- did more of ballads and slower songs that displayed their voices.

tDU347knaa	Yes, it can be.   Many people, both adults and children, have been hurt or killed due to meeting people they've met online.

It's the kids who go on it that are dangerous|`|rMmVuHEhaa	Internet is a good thing just becareful|`|s9I6QwV7aa	Yeah most dangerous but most informative and important  thing invented!|`|AA12036375	It definitely can be. The worst is for young people and young teenagers who aren't aware of the dangers out there.|`|AA11152480	sometimes|`|DeK8jbzJaa	Yeah, but it all depends on what websites you visit and who you trust on it.|`|ByWBKf6daa	It's quite dangerous but at the same time you can't deny the fact how the Internet has revolutionized this world and the age that we live in is aptly called the Internet Age. It is the best tool of communication and knowledge sharing ever invented by man.     I think it completely depends on how you use it, that's why young people get into trouble. The parents should educate their kids about the dangers associated. I think it's better to stay out of social networking sites like MySpace and all that and most of the sad things happen that way.|`|XxiHLifGaa	Depends on what you're using it for.*|`|BBVfRheyaa	Yup.

LOL|`|PD3qATQtaa	The best way is to completely cut all traces of them out of your life for a couple of months. It's tuff to deal with and your get upset from time to time but this helps you move on alot quicker and lets you focus and see other parts of your life you may have lost track of while in a relationship.     Good luck (or something along those lines if you get me).|`|DeK8jbzJaa	You can't get over the last one until you move on to the next one.  Try to keep busy, and make little goals for yourself.  Don't look at anything he gave you, or anything that makes you think of him. Out of sight, out of mind.  Yeah, it's really hard to get over someone. Over time, it wont hurt as much to think about it.  I know what you're going through :(|`|wZD9KJaFaa	I'm sorry to hear--it's tough.  Surround yourself with your friends, especially your girls.  Have nights in watching movies and also have them take you out.  It's the best way to get your mind off things.  When it happened to me, I didn't want to do anything and just sat and moped around.  My friends got me going out and doing things which really helped. I didn't think I'd be happy again after being with him for 5 years but now I met a guy who makes me a lot happier--there are better ones out there for ya! :o)|`|5418463416e8caa309a081dd29995b76aa	Have a night out with all your friends, a couple of drinks etc. Laugh a lot and you will soon get over it|`|cL62DZt2aa	move on and dont look back.|`|AA11523465	The best way to get over someone is to get "under" someone else.    Seriously, keep yourself busy, and happy, and someone better will come along.|`|rK7kUrzfaa	Recently been there too..and with the 4 year thing..seriously, it's just time..just live your life and consume yourself in work and play xxx|`|fCgfReMiaa	spend plenty of time with friends, go out have fun, keep yourself busy. don't listen to sad music. take up a new hobby. Just spend some time discovering who you are again.|`|NeFqg3fyaa	don't wory u wan't new boy friend i am free hear............|`|1d788977331f45aeb72cf21a743b1c68aa	Sorry to hear that- It's always difficult.Try to find things to occupy your time that you've always wanted to try but didn't have the time because of your relationship. Most of all try to keep your mind busy so that you don't dwell on the grieving period. Hang out with as many unattached people as possable in your free time. Relationships often cut into other friendships time, and even just phone chat with your relatives. It might be a good time to write a note to someone (mom even) just to tell her what she means to you.

Then I went out with my friends and realised there's plenty more fish in the sea.      It does take time though if you are still in love with him.    Ahh I'm all sad now :-(|`|zYAgbF49aa	Find someone else as soon as possible.|`|yvoGbxshaa	Nothing you can do just time is the only cure,4 years will be hard you have all your friends on yahoo*smiles* ,you can do the usual lots of chocolate. look at this way remember when you were in grade school and that person was the only person in your life and then you met somebody else and that was the only person that existed same rules apply  I give you a star|`|A15bfvkBaa	Aw, I'm sorry about that..

qsuYKa3naa	Yahoo has to be politically correct at all times(lol)  You will be able to answer more as you progress to different levels|`|bKtpUETnaa	because they can|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	The people who decide what gets deleted are SOCIALIST /ATHIEST wackos.I have been arguing with them for years about why they allow certain questions and delete others.|`|jBh1on7yaa	Yahoo is a private organization run by homosexuals and they love to delete anything that is not in thier agenda.|`|frwlypDWaa	This ain't no democracy...|`|xggSASTwaa	well the 17 question thing is to keep you comeing back, since they have top people its like a game. I didnt know they would delete your question if its against the government but im sure the government scan all internet stuff and if something flagged them yahoo might get in trouble so they try and catch any offensive stuff before lawsuits get involved.|`|ixixbQTWaa	well  actually the thing with the limit of answers you can give is good because yahoo answers can be so addictive that you forget you have a life|`|JPDxyTT3aa	um. you can answer more q's when you get to higher levels.    im only a level 3 so i answer like 60 daily or something.    were all just on here to be silly. you should join in.|`|1vGfcIf1aa	well the first part is because you have to earn your number of questions.  like on level one and level 2 ect.  i dont know about the rest, but thats whats it is.|`|c6NbAVgraa	Sob.

Also a lot of things are deleted for a lot of reasons. Like if you gave best answer to somebody who gets his/her account deleted then your question will be deleted as well and all the answers too. Nothing to do with you.  Y/A is operating on a system of better safe than sorry, so its never about should we delete that or not? Lets think about it, its just deleted, end of story, which is less time consuming and more efficient.    I think they have to think about legal liabilities and keeping the site as clean as possible with all those morons around, trying to fight the System!    I like Y/A, even if I get pissed off when my account is deleted and I feel a sense of injustice, especially because you can never explain yourself or change their opinion.  On the other hand, Y/A makes me more appreciative of my government of elected officials and the system of Laws and Justice under which I live.|`|a4993552752cc787c811fe933d03022daa	contact them through Yahoo help, and see what they say

jpTl3o5naa	I wish people would be a child's interests in here to make it easier to suggest anything. These kids of today usually want expensive toys. If he has a computer to work on or an MP3 player, then get him a game or music. You could always give him a gift certificate so he can choose what he wants. I know that is not as personal, but I like to give gifts they will want and use. If he doesn't have a cell phone, that could be an option. If he likes sports, then give him something for sports. I really like board games the whole family can play together and have a great time together with the whole family. Movie tickets maybe to a show he might like to see or music CD's. You know him best.

This may be one last chance to really enjoy being together.    It's hard today to spend a lot of time with our kids. Why not give him the gift of an entire day? Believe me, he'll remember it for life.     1) make breakfast together (regardless of the mess or how odd the menu might be)  2) play Monopoly or UNO (cell phone off, please)   .....OR have him teach you something (texting, monster-lore, etc)  3) go to Grandma's or a friend's house for lunch  4) spend the afternoon somewhere (IMAX, skateboard park, roller rink, museum, etc--whatever HE enjoys)  5) dinner out at the restaurant of his choice  6) rent DVDs, make popcorn, and share the evening  7) be sure to talk, talk, talk! about anything he's interested in    If you live fairly far away from great entertainment, then plan a day trip around his interests.    My aunt (with 2 sons) used to visit us in the summer and she would take each of us girls for one day on the town. We'd shop, stop at a soda fountain, and buy a treat to bring home. My sisters and I still remember it fondly.    What better gift is there for a child than time and terrific memories? It shows how special he is to you and he'll have great memories for life.    Have a wonderful, totally enjoyable day!|`|AA11016425	I used to watch TV with my kid's and write down things that they saw advertised and said they liked.

GTsKitahaa	Yup, it was definitely a slow media day.  People are losing their jobs, houses, starving, dying, etc. and they have to cover a teenager smoking pot.  Many teenagers smoke pot and get caught but it isn't plastered on the front page. I don't smoke pot, but don't think he should be crucified for it.  He got caught, will have to deal with the consequences, which are totally different than consequences of other people because of his status.  Leave him alone.|`|imziSPonaa	Not sure about the media, but the law enforcement people that want to charge him for something that you can'r prove by looking at a picture are wasting tax payers money.|`|TqSGFIFUaa	yes.  at least it wasn't cocaine or heroin.  if it was one of them then i think they have the right to be harsh.|`|4UilmYwKaa	100% agreed.|`|bYWTE40Vaa	I didint even know that was bad anymore|`|i5MiFhMyaa	Yes, the mainstream media obsesses over an athlete doing pot.

I understand he's a role model, but something like that should be a personal matter.|`|6yZ85EY5aa	Yes. The War on Drugs is so out of hand and a waste of money.

Hope you do really well and have loadsa fun!!    Jules :)|`|2xPWnuhVaa	At 23 your voice is still trainable, but probably a little less than when you were 14 or so.

You have to have the raw talent there before it is trainable. I mean, watch American Idol. Some of these people think they can sing and some can sing.

He looks over and tells the guard, "Brothers and sisters have I none, but this guy's father is my father's son."

Carnival Trick        A boy was at a carnival and went to a booth where a man said to the boy, "If I write your exact weight on this piece of paper then you have to give me $50, but if I cannot, I will pay you $50."    The boy looked around and saw no scale so he agrees, thinking no matter what the carny writes he'll just say he weighs more or less.    In the end the boy ended up paying the man $50. How did the man win the bet?       Answer: The man did exactly as he said he would and wrote "your exact weight" on the paper.
hJkM8Lygaa	I agree... a true musician would listen to a piece of music, be it there style or not...and give iot a chance and not dis it if it dosn't float there boat! I don't listen to much metal- yet i would never dis it. I love the sound "river below" -billy talent  yet i am not much of a punk listner.  I think a true musician is someone who can produce a piece of music, using instrument or voice, that gives an impact,or gives others a feeling when they listen to it.

TLNQZ63baa	http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/hiphopm...  Man, Beyonce can sing.  What an honor to perform for the PRESIDENT of the United States... she cried at the end. She's such a beautiful lady to be slammed is insult to injury.  Etta should be ashamed of herself.  Insulting them like that.      Whatever happened to being ladylike and gracious?  Etta should keep her envy to herself.  She's a has been.  Out with the old and in with the new.|`|0JjTt1rQaa	to jemgirl8   the president shouldn't have asked Etta James to perform because she doesn't even like or support Obama. Why would they ask her to sing and she doesn't even like him. Beyonce did a great job and Etta James sounds miserable and jealous.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	She is probably jealous that Beyonce sang her song at the inauguration and that she didn't get to sing it instead|`|AA11091315	Because it was Etta James who made this song famous and timeless. Beyonce didn't have a right to sing it. The Committee should have shown the legend more respect by asking her to perform her song for the President and his First Lady. Instead, they picked Beyonce, with her no singing self.|`|J30kfJpQaa	That is strange. I thought Beyonce was good enough to be nominated for an Oscar (even though her wig was bad). Etta James should just be thankful she can walk. I saw her perform in San Francisco (2002) and she was in a wheel chair and Etta James was walking fine at the premiere of Cadillac Records.|`|ghQHUr4Oaa	This was so weird to me when I heard about this because Etta was actually praising Beyonce's performance now all of a sudden she wants to beat her ***. I dont know if this is a publicity stunt or what because I just can't understand how you just go from hot to cold like that. Maybe she doesn't like beyonce getting recognition for her song. Who knows

s6qgkfLxaa	Go streaking in walmart! Wait    Is it your goal to keep your friend in or out of jail?    Hmm...  If it's to keep your friend OUT of jail..     Have your friend dress up in a real dumb outfit of boxers, suspenders, a tank or something, and like some weird knee high socks, and some ugly shoes. Have them hold a sign that says "I Love BAgelz" and then make them sing a song like that one from titanic OR Handlebars. Handlebars by Flobots would be awesome.      PS: if your friend is a dude a cheerleader outfit would be better, and make him cheer handlebars- by flobots. Hold the sign still.    EDIT: If you do this please record it and put it on youtube.

Hello ?! Wake up to 10 feet under....down on earth. We all belong on it, dont we ?    Another band that lost publicity is Camel. Their style is not metal...They tend to sound closer to Dream Theatre's progressive style pinched with a lot of psychodelic riffs in Floyd style. But the band is alive and has sold millions of copies...why there is not even a single song played on the radio...Camel has such a unique sound it can be easily identified by their sonic riffs and the melow-camelish and lazy vocals.  And I can go on and on like this with 20 more bands less or more popular to your ears. But believe me their songs speak for their true names.    With all due respect to bands such as AC/DC, Zeppelin and Sabbath the media follows historical trends rather than what the audience needs to listen.    If I say that I am American you will probably imagine that I eat hot dogs and kill terrorists while my kids are running free in the neighbourhood with high chances of being kidnapped or get missing.  Is that relevant enough to devulge such history?    Simply put and said - you cant give credit to only a few public bands that you can barely count on one hand and not to look onto songs that made a huge impact in the music industry and sold millions of copies through their singles and LPs    The music industry of 70s, 80s and so on. The roots are there, the riffs are popular, the songs...well...they were never played.     Be surprised to listen to Future Tense by Sanctuary and your jaw will fall off. To some of you this might sound as good as Metallica. But hey...you can't compare Metallica, AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin with Sanctuary...first ones are from the moon the other are from an unknown planet that could cause an infectious virus to be spread among us...now that I said the word among...it came in my head. Anthrax...never say this word out loud or else...  "Among the living" or "Amon belongs to...THEM"    ps: oh and btw I am not American, I am Romanian...you might say I am the son of Dracula.

HfXrY43Paa	LOL, I have to agree with a large portion of what you are saying! Yes I myself have come across ppl who claim they are Twilight fans and have yet to even finish the first book! But I don't agree with you about the movie not being based on the book. Now I am not saying that the movie was the "end all be all" but it was decent enough where if you never read the book it made you really want to go out to buy it just b/c you knew the "Edward" character would be more in depth and if you could care less about the character's development there were passages for the teeny bopper girls to go goo goo gah gah over. But the true Twilight fan in me can't wait for the girls who haven't even bothered to read the books first to go see "New Moon" and are expecting a Robert Pattinson screen "orgy" and if they do the next book in the series any justice will be highly disappointed with a face full of Jacob Black...lol! Oh and I am Team Jacob all the way! Edward can get so mopey it's annoying...haha|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Does it even matter?    Both book and movie are awful.    Twilight is just a baby romance novel for little girls.    I hate any fans who claim that Twilight is just super special awesome, and not know that many romance novels in the world. They need to explore more books, look around more, instead of just romance and vampires.|`|Y0O6971laa	I totally agree.  It's okay to like the book, but I hate the ones that rave on and on about it-- especially when they've never read the book.  I hated the movie and i DO think people just liked it because of Robert (EW he looks like a troll).    lol, I'm in "team Jacob", by the way :)|`|fL6jNee5aa	I hated the movie, like so much. The casting was terrible and the movie flow was even worse   But I love the books.|`|DPQVGWDDaa	i hate  the people who think their vampires becasue they seen the movie, there is a girl on youtube [ cant remember her name] but she thinks the film spoke to her on a deep level and the movie made her into a vampire lol    gave me the giggles, even tho she was serious|`|pDwdUN8Aaa	Okay well i hate those people to i read the book. can you say awsome ^_^ i can and then i watched the move but i cant blame them i think that robert pattinson is hot to but i loved the book there is a whole sequal to it and yeah i totally agree with you those are the people that you call FAKE    ^_^---That's me|`|Bbn1ZSTcaa	Um....wow......you have issues....{)i(}|`|5prmKXELaa	=)|`|GKJEgidzaa	I just hate Twilight in general. I read half of the book and it just made me want to gag. I hated it. So I don't even think I'll bother with the movie.|`|De6n2MaIaa	i don't understand twilight fans full stop.  the book and movie are both crap.|`|jtjISk6qaa	ive never read the book or seen the movie. but i think robert pattinson is a smokin' hottie|`|JbGbU6guaa	Twilight stinks and anyone who does not agree is out of their mind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|CvLwS9p5aa	they can be annoying|`|sknSVTGnaa	i know exactly how you feel. i read twilight before it became so "popular"  just because people saw other people reading it they became part of this craze. i mean i love the book and everything but i think twilight is a bit to commercialized now. with the whole "team edward" "team jacob" stuff. i mean i like twilight and all but i dont see shy people have to get SO obsessed over it. and people i just think that people who are so called "fans" are just trying to do what everyone else is doing. and its just really annoying =/|`|1ec5c3ef48df0b4438ce6e3638f0bdeaaa	i hate the fans (except my friends who know to keep it from me)    i like to punch them    her writing is atrocious    her style is non exsistant    the novel is basically just early erotic love novels for little girls|`|522Oj8OLaa	H8's a strong word lol .. I wouldnt let it get 2 u as much , i havent seen it personally myself but it looks shite - although a good romantic date film i would imagine|`|af533b17ca68713705564cacfb86ba98aa	Yes, "twilight" is getting "annoying".    "Twilight Fangirls" can kiss my "***".    And add more stars to that...|`|onOZ76esaa	i agree. it takes time to sit down and read all four books. i hate ppl that say "oh i love twilight" when they have only seen the movie. Its their loss though.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	See, I've never seen the movie nor read the book so I cannot really say it is bad or good. However, what made me NOT want to see it was the little fan-girl base going crazy over whats his name and not the actual movie or book.|`|xsifsRUUaa	YES! I do :/  Ok really I'm not a ''number 1 fan'' of either the books or the movie  I havn't even read all the books (yet)  But jeez! These hyper 'Twilight' fangirls get on my f*cking nerves so much|`|zQsNmK2baa	A friend of mine is a big of the books, and was really excited when the movie came out, but she didn't really think it was better than the books.  She thought Robert Patterson was awesome, but wasn't obsessed with him or anything.    But I get you - I get annoyed at people who only watch a movie because there's "a really fit guy in it" - it's really irritating.    But I guess you have to ask them if they're fans of the book or the movie. If they like the movie better than the book or vice versa, that's there own opinion.  But if they didn't even realise the existence of the book, help Stephenie Meyer get some of the recognition by recommending it to them. If they're still not interested - their loss.|`|AA10262819	Maybe they are just fans of Twilight the movie?  They're just kids and this is what kids do.  I was an idiot for the Rocky Horror Picture show.  I saw it over 600 times in the theater and belonged to a floor show.  I saw it recently and I can't believe how stupid it is.     I know they're annoying but there is so little joy in the world right now that I can't justify snatching away what little someone can find.|`|GcZRN4kkaa	Read the first book before I heard of the movie. It was decidedly average at best. Then I watched tne movie and it reflected the book nearly perfectly. I am no die hard fan. Stephenie Meyer should not be praised for her Twilight books anymore than I should be praised for the speed I type as both of them are decidedly average and Twilight fangirls should calm down as the book really isn't that good and neither is the movie. And neither is the n00b who plays Edward. Harry Potter and The Demonata are better series than the Twilight series. Luckily, Harry Potter got the recognition it deserves but The Demonata hasn't. Crappy Stephanie Meyer fangirls should read a better book once in a while and give good authors a chance to breathe not authors who think they know vampires and girls with "Awesome Smelling Blood?" It's a seriously over-hyped book and series and people need to recognise that before the rest of the world discovers it and good books are left in the dark.|`|dBrGgTVjaa	okay first off...  i agree, most of the people who are "fans" just love the movie and the hott guys in the movie.     second, i don't agree with any kind of crazy "fans", people who become obsessed with books and movies obviously dont have a life, or they are dissatisfied with their lives, it the same thing as those freaks who wish they were superheroes.  and any fan who is obssessed with twlight obviously wishes that they were some creep vampire.     people need to take a dose of reality and grow up, and being "fans" of themselves, not fake characters in a movie or in a book.     also, why is it that people dont become obessed fans about people who really make a change in world who are real heroes and real people?    and im not just a stright up hater of twilight cause i read the book and watched the movie and they are ok, but f*** those people who have nothing better to do but dream they were a vampire.|`|ndXvMLZ2aa	Really I don't understand the big fuss over the movie AND book. I thought they both sucked...|`|g2Jr6zGKaa	YEAH!  tell me about it!  ;~D  I HATE IT TOO  that is why i do not know anything about it.|`|7a2efb9a491bf91f2d2a622649572fdfaa	i read em and thought they were ok...i think let people appreciate them in there own way...the thing that i am annoyed about is it is not comic or animation related...there is a book section on answers dagnammit!!|`|K1GYtYryaa	I just hate Twilight all together.|`|AA10614226	Yes|`|M81kPDoLaa	Geez.  The books were okay.  Nothing lifechanging or profoundly deep. But they were readable. Just.  The film was marginally better than the book in the way that Bella wasn't such a freakin 'Sue all the time!!|`|AA12336352	I've have read all four books, I really liked them.  I haven't seen the movie yet.. but I've heard good and bad things about it.  Honestly, It doesn't bother me one bit if people are fans of the movie, who haven't read the book.  There are lots of books made into movies, and its sometimes, easier just to watch a movie, then read a book.  Especially for people who don't like to read.  Sooo whats it matter, maybe they don't know the whole storyline.... thats their loss.. you know the whole story, and can appreciate it even more.  :)|`|C1E3KbdJaa	Agreed.  But I don't like the books.|`|COGedxQfaa	I absolutely love the books, and i love the movie as well. But I do prefer the books.  I agree with the fans who have just seen the movie and are suddenly experts. Personally it really gets on my nerves when people get over obsessed with movies and the characters.   I do understand that people love movies, but sometimes it gets just a bit too creepy.|`|ldGz9UoBaa	I hate Twilight fans|`|HUdCBaJ0aa	i feel the same way about that if you havent read the books then dont say your a real twilight fan
32P3hG0Laa	First: it's called astral projection.    Second: the experience can vary.     Some people start by simply finding themselves out of their body, but in the same room. They see themselves lying in bed, but realize they are not body-bound.    Some people discover they can fly, or go for walks. Some people find they can simply will themselves to be in a different place by wanting to be. They think to themselves "Oh I want to go to _________" and then suddenly they are there.    And whenever you want to be back in your body, just think it.    Like any other ability we have, practice makes it better, and of course, some skills come easier to some people.

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	KINGS -- Kings is an inspiring exploration of the timeless David vs. Goliath struggle. The show is set in a modern metropolis under siege where the fighting has gone on for too long and cost far too many lives. When David Shepherd (Christopher Egan, Resident Evil: Extinction), a brave young soldier, rescues the kings (Golden Globe winner Ian McShane, Deadwood) son from enemy territory, he sets events in motion that will finally bring peace. Suddenly, David is thrust into the limelight, earning the affections of women -- including the kings daughter. When hes promoted to captain, he becomes the reluctant poster boy for hope. But for David, the line between his allies and enemies will blur as the power players in the kingdom go to great lengths to see him fall. From the director (Francis Lawrence) of the blockbuster movie I Am Legend comes the ultimate story of David vs. Goliath, and theres no telling who will win. Sebastian Stan (Gossip Girl) also stars. Kings is a production of Universal Media Studios; Michael Green (NBCs Heroes) is the executive producer. Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) is the director and executive producer and Erwin Stoff (I Am Legend) also is executive producer

LWEsv6Pqaa	Buster is my absolute favorite. Why? Because he's a 32-year-old child. I love how dependent he is on Lucille. It makes for great comedy. Apparently he was in the womb for 11 months and there were claw marks on the walls of Lucille's uterus.    "My army training is telling me that this is a hot mission. Maybe we should call it Operation Hot Mother."    "It's all regulation, Michael. To get the top right, the pants had to be a little snug."    "Either I zip down or he zips up! And that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit! You have to get on your knees to start it!"    [crawling under a trampoline]  "This will keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun."    "So watery...and yet there's a smack of ham to it..."    Those are just my top five favorite Buster quotes. Lucille is probably me second favorite character. "I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it." Classic Arrested Development.|`|vUv21BkMaa	I love G.O.B. the most!!    G.O.B.: And now you love the Ten Commandments.

18K7ucsEaa	I guess it can be... but emo is emotional music, usually characterized by a slower tempo with meaningful lyrics about feelings. Grindcore is extremely fast usually very short songs with heavy distortion and screamor growl vocals...|`|rMlGeeg9aa	nooo, there really isn't such a thing as "emo music" there're many MANY different kinds of music and most ending in 'core' just indicate that the music is heavier or more intense. "emo music" just indicates that it has somewhat masochistic lyrics and what not. hope I helped =]

aQcsrgLCaa	Initially, guitars were amplified in order for them to be loud enough to be heard. Guitars in big bands were not able to compete with traditional instruments.    At first guitars were mechanically amplified with companies like Dobro and National making guitars with a resonator inside.    When Fender and Gibson invented and produced electric guitars, they could be heard and could take a lead in bands.    Blues musicians used them for the same reasons. They could be heard above the noise of an audience in a concert hall, rent party or hootenanny.|`|vXavvgQXaa	Another reason would be that blues musicians really helped pioneer the National electric guitars. The better question is why does everyone else use them.|`|I3CNklLKaa	Because the blues sounds ridiculous when played on the euphonium.|`|PugkFRRpaa	the pickups perhaps. or maybe just they like they way they sound. guitar doesn't have to be all crunch. it can be softer and deeper.|`|IocBMKIZaa	The contrast between the low pitch tones of the voice with an electric guitar is far more impressive than a normal acoustic.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	some play electric, some play acoustic. a lot of modern players are too lazy to learn the difficult finger picking techniques associated with acoustic blues.    geoff- ever heard Taj Mahal's cakewalk into town? I mean I think it is a tuba in that song, but the point is it can be done.|`|X7bWwNWcaa	i would say, being a guitar player myself that you can get a much better sound and effects out of many electric guitars, the blues guitarist i know get the best rhythm out of there guitars and it just cant be beaten by any acoustic guitar i have heard recently!|`|TZz1uPY2aa	Because it's a good instrument to accompany the voice. It's easy to play. It's portable( ever try to carry around a piano) And being electric it can produce a volume that can be heard in different situations. It's the same reason they use a microphone|`|ChtKZYx9aa	It sounds a bit like a voice, only you cant hear the words, so you can play all kinds of dirty sentences and such to amuse the audience and yourself. This idea is inspired by Frank Zappa.

e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	Same deal here and I have no idea why. I'm Aquarius and I get along with the guys but I always clash with the girls for some reason. I have an abundance of air in my chart so I don't know what the problem is.    edit: Aquariass, those are the ones I keep running into too! Also two-faced and boastful. I too know that ALL Libras aren't like that but I wish I could meet a cool Libra chick for once. I know they're out there :)|`|gUUtGcbBaa	libras arent jealous  ii dont get along with all libras either and im suppose to get along with them but it depends on the month they were born too.    if they were born in september, then they will be more critical cause, they are more like virgos i guess. which are extremely critical|`|MtANnIlfaa	It's ok i don't get along with them either for the most part.. i could name a lot of reasons why.. but i will just tell you the number one reason why i can't stand a libra.. they are too emotional for their own good.. i can't stand a sensitive man/woman. No offense Libras.|`|y5dwVEK5aa	maybe ur just smarter than they are and that makes them jealous|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Well, that is just sun signs.   The Libras you have met probably have incompatible positions to yours such as the moon, rising sun, Mars, etc.     Also, funny thing is that I've noticed a lot of drama between Aqua suns and Libra suns in real life... There were some that got along. Even online, people on here said the same thing.|`|0HGqGJYTaa	I actually get along with Aquarius, but blame it in on my Aqua moon and being co-ruled by Aquarius...with men and woman, we connect instantly.

rkh01QI2aa	? the girl has relapsed, the dude is worried sick cause he's been there before himself.......PINK ROCKS!!!?|`|LkRP4OKaaa	Ok this is from experience...Its about Relapse,when a person knows what its like to be good and sober after had been on drugs and they go back to doing them they go way over the top with drug use and feel like **** because they know its wrong.And to get sober again after relapse is 10 times harder each time you *Slip*.Her boyfriend had used and Recoverd"And he's a real good guy and he  Wants to save her 'cause he's  More than been there all before" But since her drug use she nolonger comes around andhe misses he thats why he dreams she knocs on his door,shes way too far gone.....Hope this was enugh explanation.|`|bVIewZe9aa	hmm  i think its about a girl thats on drugs and cant control her life.  maybe her boyfriend is helping her get the drugs?   Emma (:|`|GKJEgidzaa	It means:    ' I am going to air my dirty laundry in public and exploit myself to make some money '|`|IocBMKIZaa	A girls on drugs and she has a guy who wants to save her.    her life seems perfect yet she still ain't happy.    it's pretty much the moral story of how having everything just doesn't make you happy on its own.    the guy is so terribly inlove with her but he's helpless to help her if she doesn't help herself.|`|elSUVcaZaa	This is just my take on it: the song is about someone who is trapped in repeated self destructive behavior. Her earlier loss of "the man of her dreams" suggests that she has little self control. This is also demonstrated by her return to drugs, and also by the line, that says "she's travelin' where the wind is blowing", suggesting that she is at the mercy of other forces.  The boy in the song is holding out hope for her to ask for his help by, "knocking on his door"
wMunBQ9Oaa	There were two women that went fishing very often and one always caught the most fish.  So one lady one day said, "Hold up, wait a minute.  Explain something.  How come no matter where you are in the damn boat, you catch all the damn fish--whether it's the front, the middle, or the back of the boat."  The other lady said, "Okay, I'll tell you my secret.  Every morning that we go fishing, I look at the ole man's pecker.  If it's laying to the left, I fish in the front of the boat.  If it's laying to the right, I fish in the back of the boat.  If it's laying square in the middle of his thighs, I fish in the center of the boat."  The lady that asked the question scratched her head and then asked, "Well, what do you do when it's standing straight up?"  The other lady answered, "Them the days we don't go fishing!"|`|VwEUO6reaa	hehe  good effort|`|9IfItE9uaa	srry but read it a few days ago on answers

cLm5FqWnaa	I brought my current wife to one of those places you can paint a piece of unfinished pottery and they put it in the kiln for you. It was nice and relaxing and gave us plenty of time to talk. Going to a movie or something of that nature does not give you much time to talk to each other. We both had a great time.|`|nijx1J00aa	start a bar brawl... you'll remember that date forever...|`|VEXKm1Obaa	I personally like to take a gal to a coffee shop or a nice place to get a couple drinks to chat. I like first dates that you can get to know the person and talk, thats why I NEVER take a gal to the movies on a first date.    Plus if the date is not going well, its much easier to leave when its something as simple as coffee or a few drinks instead of being in the middle of dinner.|`|c8HHi3Wqaa	A nice polka bar followed by a yodeling contest wrapped up by a clogging competition.  Hell of a night.|`|cHiv6eTWaa	First dates are usually very awkward so a low pressure date like a donut and coffee shop, or a pizza place or a quite small place where you an hear each other and just chat and get to know each other to see if your even compatible. Being a female I can tell you that I  can size up a guy on the first date easily but I am also in my 40's so I've been around the block a couple times too. Good luck it's rough out there.|`|AA11080330	maybe a dinner, movie...just a litle making out in the back of the movie theatre.    Then take /her home.

Roxy thought Sean was still under water when he appeared behind a tree, he started walking towards her but she told him to go. because if he went back to the square, the police would've got him for kidnapping Amy (the baby) so Roxy let him go and be free from arrest.|`|xmX27jTSaa	he took roxy to the ice and they both fell through,  ronnie jumped in and saved roxy  an they thought sean was dead, roxy saw sean getting out of the water and told him to leave an dnt come back.ronnie and jack didnt see this so they think he is dead|`|GHjPLWq7aa	he probably just left hopefully|`|X4hz3a9haa	he left because he found out the baby was not his and he could not bring up another mans child, he walked off into the night after trying to drive into the water with roxi and the baby then changing his mind. he realised he had problems and thought roxi would be better off without him.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	he's moving to live in Coronation St|`|LElTSYaFaa	yeh hes left :(.. i dno if he died or not.. i dont thnk so.. mayb he'l b back soon :) x|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Because Roxie's Baby, Is Jacks Baby too so she lied to Sean & Ronnie and Sean couldnt handle it so he randomly left|`|aCdya2qkaa	lolz. that so true, If Sean Slater  has left the show, its a big loss to Eastenders.    I think Eastenders are getting scrappy with their story lines, they just drag on. They have so many characters and Eastenders try to focus on all but they should try to focus on the more main key Eastenders actors/actresses like Phil Mitchell. Now its all about Jeannine.

YmGyRRmmaa	looked it up on google this is what i found?    Review about The Blower's Daughter    --------------------------------------...  helpful | Reviewer: lonelyOnChristmas | 12/25/08    simply wonderful.. i researched the true meaning of this song and found out that it's a song about the writer's love for the daughter of his flute teacher(=blower).     "did I say that I loathe you?"  This song means to me that i should finally stop falling for the love of my life because he will never realize what i've done for him. Although i will always love him ("life goes easy on me - most of the time")..      Hope this helps
BvRH65wmaa	This was a pain in the butt!  But I got it for you.    Christians Never say Goodbye - The Nelons    I was standing by the bed side  of a dear and precious saint  with tear stained eyes I held his hand  his life was growing faint  he looked at me and said; "my child  why do you look so sad,  I'm going now to my new home you'll see me again    Chorus:  Christians never say goodbye  we only move to our home on high   free from pain  and never die   with Jesus we will reign  a wife may loose her husband  or a mother lose her child  whatever the case we all can say  christians never say goodbye    now he's gone to live in heaven   a life free from pain   his suffering now has an end   and our loss will be their gain  by Jesus rights he is healed his pain   will be no more let's release the precious saint  to the arms of the Lord    Chorus X 2    I'm sorry for your loss, and may the Lord grant your sister a place in Heaven.

GNmqM4OMaa	If you're just looking to record your own music, then I would suggest finding someone who's gone to school and knows what they're doing to just record for you, rather than spending money to go to school and learn how to do it and getting equipment (that stuff can cost you thousands upon thousands, believe me). It will definitely be a lot easier that way.  Hope that helped!|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	Knowledge, go to school , get a job at a actual recording studio|`|13ab2eb08c3b29c7e124e905335006c0aa	go to a music store and tell them what you have and want to do   they will set you up with what you really need vs what you really dont need ,  the older the seller the more they know about the software   look for the guy whos in his 40s to 60|`|6UeDWQ45aa	Computer, high quality recording program (like protools), great ear, place to record (2 rooms are better than 1), microphones (several), cables (lots), headphones, knowledge, Good quality speakers, second set of speakers, keyboards, instruments, patch bays, money to buy anything you might need for the studio, desk, chair, contractor and designer to build and design your studio with proper acoustics.  I work in two recording studios and have a home setup.  One studio is over $100K, the second studio is around $15k.  My home studio (which I only use for midi - I don't actually do live recording there) is around $2k.|`|EKTO5p4Yaa	Greetings,    I've owned three different commercial recording studios so I think I'm qualified to answer that question.      First, you could spend the next 10 years just learning about room acoustics and sound proofing.  There are people that only specialize in that field.  That is just but one aspect of the business.    The gear necessary and the knowledge of computers, both hardware and software, could easily cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars and take years and years to master.    Wouldn't it be smarter to go work in a studio first?  Wouldn't it make sense to go intern for free at some nice studios so you can save some time and money by learning from pro's?      The last thing you would want to do is have someone (like a store clerk at a music store) tell you what you need.  Look, I've been doing this for a long time and most of what I need isn't in any music store or online for free - anyone that says otherwise is just plain wrong.  Much of what professional studios use is actually hand made or made by specialists.  Do you think Tiger Woods uses golf clubs he bought at some store?  It isn't any different in this industry.    If you ignore my advice and try to go it alone, all you'll do is waste time and money trying to figure things out the hard way.  Get on the phone and beg beg beg some of the local studios for an internship.    Trust me on this one. . .

7LJ2Tx2Yaa	If it is outside, you don't have to do too much with lighting.  You can get tag board or something and use it as a bounce card for additional lighting needed.    Just make sure you white balance you camera before filming.  I would suggest not to do too much hand held if you want it to look crisp on screen.  Although, hand held can add some much needed stylization.    Most things you can do to make your film look good is in post production.  That is color correction, adjusting sound levels ect.      Just remember, being able to see and hear everything is most important.  Focus on that first.    Also, if you can film HD video, do that.  Just make sure your editor can edit in the format you are filming in.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	The movies in theaters cost millions of dollars to make, and everyone involved has many years of experience.

AA10053661	I write. It's just the safest way for me to get all my frustrations out. I can say what I'm feeling and pull all the emotions out and get it down on paper. The good thing is, if I'm terribly irritated, writing it all usually helps me solve the problem at the same time that I'm relieving myself of all of the anger I was holding inside. It gives me time to think and reason through things I suppose I never would have thought about if I had just let the words flow out towards the person or thing I was irritated with. It gives me time to compose my thoughts...... get a level head. Then I can totally approach the person I need to confront in a much more civilized manner later without causing more conflict than there needs to be.     Trust me..... after I reason through all of this, I totally delete whatever I've written. I've never been so frustrated that I just sent an email to someone only to regret it later. Well, not often at least. lol ;)    Thanks for the question! Was kinda cool to realize what it is I really do..... thanks.|`|8VSKLiuoaa	Cry!     or just breatheee!|`|6fbce3ff42dd216a83c3e009ccebb0eeaa	Phone a friend..|`|a1pmr73vaa	shake my leg like a dog on heat|`|cC568h4xaa	Write down your feelings, rather than vent verbally to others.  For many people, this works amazingly well.  Harry Truman ued to write scathing letters and place them in his desk drawer.  If he was till irritated 3 days later, then he would send the letter.  Most of the time, the 3 days of delay allowed him to cool down.    Good luck!|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	First I try to fix whatever it is that is irritating me, then I talk to get it off my chest.|`|p0c4mek6aa	I'll either walk/drive it off alone, so I can have some time to think.|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	have a double|`|AA10409668	Walk away before I say something I'll regret later.  --------------|`|bBHlGs5waa	I take anti-depressants.|`|cE9QIMNiaa	cry!  or go driving and hit things.|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	Go somewhere quiet and think to myself...with some music on|`|8ZxdLiaJaa	listen to music :and then start crying .|`|nAK82h6vaa	I say what's on my mind,It flows all out|`|jF1xH89Caa	I have to walk away from the situation for a few minutes and go smoke|`|Ju8PJZsraa	get away from everything and everyone so i won't say something that I'll regret later.

I will be 43 and most of my friends are in the same age group.  Like any group of friends we have a few older and a few younger but again, most of us are within 5 year age range.  Given that age range most of us were teenagers in the early-mid 80's.  I love my friends, I really do butttttttt, I have a couple of friends that seriously have had the same 'do for the last 25 years.  You know, slightly curly perm with part of the bangs curled forward and the rear part of the bangs curled back.  We call this the b**ch-flip, lol.  Hairdos aside, my one friend has been wearing big sweaters with leggings (you know them as skinny jeans) for so long that they have come back in style.      The one friend with the b**ch-flip I have even invited to go get a make-over with me (hey, I'm no prize either, lol) but she won't go. The one with the clothes...well, she's such a character, it actually works for her.    Having said all of this, both of these gals would give you the shirt off their back if you needed it, I love them dearly and I wouldn't  trade them for all the world.|`|14533cc4696a0ba7f60e883e8f54979baa	look at your parents yearbooks

They specialize in Black Angus prime cut meats weighing up to 5 lbs. They slaughter their own beef, of which can be witnessed by those that can stomach such a thing, and then patrons may choose the cut of beef of their preference. I prefer the Double M special of which is a 5 lb. cut of  USDA Black Angus top sirloin done medium rare over an open fire pit.  The special also includes, steak fries, fiesta corn, summer salad, and fresh baked rolls with butter, and of course I wash it all down with an ice cold Foster's beer.|`|clqgFUFFaa	the chineese people on the corner|`|4TmN5Dohaa	Capital Grill|`|RP5NnxgUaa	Ruby Tuesdays.|`|wAAhMn6Xaa	Mcdonalds!  =]|`|JD3yWKNGaa	Cheesecake Factory.|`|s30Duwdraa	Lone Star Bar & Grill!!

Ow3O7h4caa	A fork at the end of the life life means that , at some point, you will lead a double life or face 2 instances where their will be a major choice to make.   And this willl happen more than once. As for death predictions, you have to look at both hands. I did a reading on a person who was suppose to be dead if I rely on one hand only. Without looking at her other hand, I told her exactly how her life line was and that she underwent surgery for cancer and that, pills kept her alive.    She acknowledged this and was stunned at the accuracy. By the same token, that same life line, (with other marks) revealed that her husband has had a few heart attacks. Again, she acknowledged and I didn't know any of these people.    You have to use your 6th sense in matters like this and when you hold the persons' hand, you feel the energy and you pick up the vibes if you are sensitive enough and makes the reading easier and quicker.    Hope this helps....|`|1d953f4fe15e5745e5b8940982159cedaa	Don't get allarmed, a fork on the life line has got nothing to do with death, it is only marking a relocation.   And to calculate when this will happen, you have to take the point at the beginning of the split.

4f5065c93c02064e23a0050dccd21381aa	I don't know, but I saw an episode where he made this girl's tooth fall out, and then put it back in. While it was out, you could see the empty space and it was bleeding. Then, all of a sudden, it was back in and the blood was gone. I'm not going to pretend to understand how he did it, but it was pretty cool. Alright, I'm a little slow tonight. My girlfriend says I confused him with David Blaine. I have seen Criss Angel's show, and he's done some pretty cool stuff, like going through a glass window, without breaking it. Like I said, who knows how they do it. It's all a trick, but it's still fun to watch.|`|21075ae03bcdf1dde1c555ea6bffa0acaa	i'd say you're both right. while some tricks may be completely staged with nothing but actors there, others are performed in front of an audience with maybe a few actors around if any.|`|d24d1a54cde8eb1712d259bfa0f3bcb4aa	Yeah~ One of my friends has watched him do his "tricks" or "magic" whatever you want to call it live before..|`|ade33783cd06693ec9314261437a16dcaa	I think they are all actors because there are things that they could see that would give the tricks away and as actors they are under contract and wouldn't reveal the info. I don't think the tricks are real either but with a hired audience no one gives away any information that would let on what we suspect - that the tricks aren't something to be believed.    Since he's all about illusions.. wouldn't the fact that it's not a "real" reality show be the biggest illusion of all?|`|1bdbd8159e381fc8dfecad4903f0de28aa	Criss definitely has "plants" in his audience, I think on pretty much every trick.  It is the reason that I stopped being interested in his shows.  Once you realize that he definitely uses actors, and that nearly anybody or everybody that he's doing the trick for, or with, *could* be one of those actors -- then it loses pretty much all of its edge and you don't trust anything you see to be any sort of great magic trick or illusion.    That and the fact that there a kajillion camera cuts on just about every trick.  Even when he says "one continuous shot," it's NOT one continuous shot.  There are cuts and different camera angles.  Once you realize that with even just *one* of those cuts, any amount of time could have passed and ANYTHING at all could have been set up, then again it pretty much kills any intrigue I have with any of his tricks.    Then there's Criss's family.  There's his one brother, whose job is to pace back and forth and bite his nails and wring his hands at everything Criss attempts, act stressed out, and say things like "there's no way he is doing that again!"  Then there's Costa, his other brother, whose job is to say how everyone loves Criss and speak in vague terms about everything else.  Then his mom, whose job is to freak out, scream and act like Criss is in mortal danger in any trick he attempts.    Finally, to address your question, some of the scenes truly make me wonder whether, at least sometimes, the *entire* audience is made up of plants.  Some of the scenes are just too surreal.  He'll be at a pool in Vegas or wherever, and he'll "borrow" a towel from one of the "patrons" there, and they give it to him in sort of a detached manner, and then hang back and talk amongst themselves again rather than being intrigued with what Criss is going to do with the towel he just took from them, like most people would.  Then a little further in the background, there are people just hanging around the pool and occasionally glancing at Criss and his "audience" (and camera crew, obviously), and then turning back to what they were discussing amongst themselves.  It's weird.  Wouldn't you think that if Criss Angel showed up at your hotel's swimming pool with a camera crew, ready to do some tricks for you, that he'd be swarmed by the entire crowd there?  But no, instead he just has a few people around him, and the other "extras" in the scene just idly go about their business in the background, barely paying him any attention.  It reeks of unreality.    Oh and one more thing, why are so many people in his audience dim bulbs?  You'll notice that neither Criss Angel nor David Blaine ever pick, oh say, a lawyer or a businessperson for an audience member.  No, it's usually some moron that says OMG!  Shut up!  hahaha!!11!!!1! and other brilliant things -- or runs away.  I never understood that reaction, running away.  WHY would you run away from a magic trick?  Yet you see this all the time, mainly with David Blaine's audience members.  (Check out the girls that run away when he bites a nickel in half, or the guys that run away when he levitates.)  I don't get it.  It makes no logical sense.  I'd be paying extremely close attention and analyzing the entire trick to see if I could catch what is going on -- NOT running away.    Still, I have to admit that even with plants in the audience, and even with the possibility of things going on between camera cuts, I still have no clue how these guys accomplish some of their stunts, like floating from building to building or walking across a pool, and so on.  It's still entertaining, and you still sort of WANT to believe it's something amazing.  So you watch.  But a "reality show" it ain't.|`|3d14ba59291b3070b46026c6bddd58d5aa	OK I think that the "idea" of Criss Angel in a reality show is so people know it's real i.e. re-al-ity show. What did you want it to be an Ed Sullivan like prime time special that's on TV every week?! I mean what's wrong with people? Do you have no ability to think unless it's fed to you via tabloids? Can't you see that's the only way a show like this can be marketed (frustrated sigh)? Also why in the HELL would anyone put a show on television (especially a class act network like A &E) that's a bunch of fake dime-store tricks with a pre-cast fake audience as you suggest Criss Angel's show is? I could do that! Maybe even YOU could though I doubt it if you came up with a question like this. Also, what is this "I don't believe the tricks as do most people" stuff? You know MOST people? Do you also not believe that  Neal O. set foot on the moon, or anything else you see with your own eyes? I say give up watching Criss Angel and go back to what's probably your fav show--X Files LOL.|`|d5707a466bbd84ff9d6588fbd5cda26aaa	i dont think so i wish they would take that show off its so stupid!|`|ed57b5df5c1364c2a534c777aa11904daa	yea the audience is real hes awesome Kelsey doesn't know **** his show isn't stupid  Kelsey is stupid not criss angel

31abc6887170a60e97857497f538c28faa	Vou te mandar td q sei a respeito...  Espero q goste...  A express?o Tigres asiticos refere-se s economias de Hong Kong, Singapura, Coria do Sul e Taiwan (Formosa); esses territrios e pases apresentaram grandes taxas de crescimento e rpida industrializa??o entre as dcadas de 1960 e 1990.    Histrico    A partir da dcada de 80, alguns pases do Pacfico come?aram a apresentar altos ndices de crescimento mundial e interferncia no mercado mundial, sendo por isso designados como tigres asiticos. Os termos lembram agressividade e  exatamente essa a caracterstica fundamental dos quatro pases que formam esse grupo. Eles utilizaram estratgia arrojada de atra??o de capital estrangeiro - apoiada na m?o-de-obra barata e disciplinada, na isen??o de impostos e nos baixos custos de instala??o de empresas.    A imensa e ininterrupta expans?o da economia japonesa foi decisiva para criar um dinamico mercado em toda a rea circundante do Pacifico. O Jap?o atuou n?o s como estmulo, mas tambm como exemplo. O crescimento mais marcante foi o apresentado pela Coria do Sul, um dos mais pobres pases em desenvolvimento na dcada de 1960, que se transformou numa semi-industrializada na??o de renda mdia. O progresso de Taiwan seguiu o mesmo rumo. O pas asitico que iniciou esse ciclo rpido de crescimento foi o Jap?o, com uma bem sucedida reforma agrria, seguida de um aumento rpido da renda dos fazendeiros, que criou um mercado local para novas fbricas.    No final da dcada de 1990, as exporta??es chegavam a 202% do PNB (produto nacional bruto) em Singapura e a 132% em Hong Kong. O ndice de crescimento era alto nos tigres, e, a despeito da crise asitica, a popula??o tinha um alto nvel de alfabetiza??o e a economia girava em torno da constru??o naval, produtos txteis, petroqumicos e equipamentos eltricos. O crescimento mais notvel ocorreu principalmente na economia de entrepostos. Hong Kong, gra?as  economia de mercado puro e, apesar de sobrecarregada pelas desvantagens do colonialismo (anteriormente existente enquanto col?nia britanica), elevou sua renda per capita para cerca de seis vezes mais que a da China continental.    Os Tigres compartilham muitas caractersticas com outras economias asiticas, como Jap?o e China. Iniciaram o que passou a ser visto como uma particular aproxima??o asitica do desenvolvimento econ?mico. Alguns desses pases estavam na dcada de 1960 com indicadores sociais semelhantes a de pases africanos altamente estagnados; as principais transforma??es basearam-se em acesso  educa??o e cria??o de infra-estrutura de transportes (fundamental para a exporta??o competitiva).    Com o tempo, o termo Tigre tornou-se sin?nimo de na??o que alcan?ou o crescimento com um modelo econ?mico voltado para exporta??o. Recentemente, na??es do Sudeste asitico, como Indonsia, Malsia, Filipinas e Tailandia tambm passaram a ser consideradas Tigres.    Economia dos Tigres    Os Tigres asiticos alcan?aram o desenvolvimento com um modelo econ?mico exportador; esses territrios e na??es produzem todo tipo de produto para export-los a pases industrializados. O consumo domstico  desestimulado por altas tarifas governamentais.    Eles encaram a educa??o como um meio de aumentar a produtividade. Os pases melhoraram o sistema educacional em todos os nveis, assegurando que toda crian?a freqente o ensino fundamental e o ensino mdio. Tambm investiu-se na melhoria do sistema universitrio.    Como os Tigres eram relativamente pobres durante a dcada de 1960, tinham abundancia de m?o-de-obra barata. Juntamente com a reforma educacional eles conseguiram aproveitar essa vantagem, criando uma for?a de trabalho de baixo custo, mas muito produtivo.

In anderen L?ndern wird das sogar recht gerne gesehen, allerdings eher Auslandsaufenthalte. Aber solche Erfahrungen werden immer mehr gesch?tzt. Und wenn du es geschickt machst, dann kannst du dieses Jahr sogar recht gut verkaufen. Du k?nntest zum Besipiel  ein Buch oder Berichte fr eine Zeitung o.?. schreiben [kannst du dann in meinem Verlag ver?ffentlichen ;-) ]. Dann hast du auch kiene Lcke im Lebenslauf.    Ich f?nde sowas auch spannend. Allerdings wrde ich es glaube ich nicht auf D limitieren. DAfr gibts einfach zu viele interessante Orte auf der Welt und so unterschiedlich ist es in D auch nicht.

AA11729534	Depends on to what extent.  Some people equate not using racial slurs as simply being politically correct and that's pretty low.

Did you know you can't say ''Brain Storm'' as it may offend people who have epilepsy....wtf?!?!|`|7HKTDcvYaa	The term politically correct comes about because political statements have to be carefully considered as to what feelings they may bring to the front that are not related to the  message. Politicians do not want to alienate even a part of the electorate.    If you use politically incorrect terminology, you demonstrate that you are willing to alienate others. Now if you are speaking for yourself alone, be our guest and alienate whoever you hate.  But if you are speaking for the company, for the group politic, understand that what you say alienates people who might have bought our product, voted our way, or even chosen to work with us. If you are perceived as speaking for the group, consider the objectives of the group.    Actually, if you are a friend I care about I will caution you about saying things that will hurt your own future. Some people will have long memories and a recording device.|`|AA12280291	I don't talk Politics with People, so No...|`|AA12382198	Nope....I'm one of those people.

6vzpHTqQaa	I'm with you; I hardly laughed at the one after the Super Bowl.  The best line was Michael telling Kevin that he worked like he had no legs or arms.  Other than that, most of the episode just wasn't that funny...even by Office standards.|`|POHWTDPRaa	The writers are trying too hard. God knows why. The show was perfect before. Silly but simple. Now it's 'As the Office Turns'. Jim and Pam are boring. I think everyone can see the breakup coming. They aren't going to get married, they never were. It's time to split them up and finally end the storyline. And if they aren't going to stop making everything so ridiculous and unbelievable, maybe it's time to just end the show.|`|0NkrNStxaa	i think that it is still funny...but def not as good as the other seasons... i think they are trying to hard too be funny. Plus I feel like theres no more excitement or anticipation left in the show.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	They cant have the same thing going on forever. I LOVEd this season because of the angela/dwight/andy thing. Plus the commericials showed karen is pregnant! I was mad that Hollie left though :( she was perfect for Michael.|`|vL7gkN7uaa	I disagree. I think season five is awesome. Nothings beats season 2, but the characters do have to evolve, and new problems and situations have to occur. i love how alot of the background characters are getting the limelight now. True, it is a little soap opera'ish, but its still just as funny. Have you been keeping up with the story line? its important to do that, You cant just watch it once in a blue and expect to understand or get every joke.The Office is still and will contibue to be my favorite all time show.

AA12307902	You are correct. I think it is Whoopi Goldberg...|`|870cf8fc919e9e77bf463960442999aaaa	I love Whoopi too but not her sorry:    Bidet is a French word for pony (and in Old French, bider meant to trot). This etymology comes from the fact that one bestrides or rides a bidet much like one does a pony.    The bidet appears to have been an invention of French furniture makers in the late 17th or early 18th century, although no exact date or inventor is known. Theories exist that its inventor is Christophe Des Rosiers, furniture maker of the French Royal Family. The earliest written reference to the bidet is in 1710.    By 1900, thanks to plumbing improvements, the bidet (and chamber pot) moved from the bedroom to the bathroom.    1960 saw the introduction of the electronic bidet, an attachment which connects on to existing toilet arrangements - ideal for bathrooms lacking the space for a separate bidet and toilet.

That's the theory anyway.    As for it being too popular, I like all music, so I don't really mind

4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	I'm not sure what you mean.  But I'll try my best to understand your question here.    A full E major scale would be E-F -G -A-B-C -D -E (or for just a major pentatonic, E-F -G -B-C -E).  Maybe when you said "consists of" you meant to say "includes".    An E7 chord (E dominant 7th) is E-G -B-D.  An Emaj7, which I think is what you meant, would have a D  instead of a D.  But if I'm reading your staff right, it looks like the notes you have are G-D-B-E, which would be yet another chord, an Emin7.    I still don't know what you mean by "playing this chord in an E major scale".  Are you asking how to play a chord, an arpeggio, or a scale?    If you want to know how to play THAT chord in the staff such that the high E is coming from the 5th fret of your 2nd string, you'd have to do something like "35x45x" (third fret on the low E string, 5th fret on the A string, mute the next string, hit the fourth fret on the D string, and finally the 5th fret on the B string).  Though it would be much easier to raise the G and D up an octave and play xx0000 or play some other fingering of an Emin7 chord.|`|19dc1ab3ffe57acfab7cd68038391ee6aa	7th fret on the A string|`|81abe3d7ea90e649ea73b6b6333fa31aaa	don't know buddy........... but u can take help from: www.guitartips.com

W?hrend die Mutter sich die Dessous anschaut, stehen Vater und Sohn voller Staunen vor einer geteilten Metalltr, die sich wie von Geisterhand ?ffnet und einen kleinen Raum freigibt. (Es ist natrlich ein Aufzug).  Fragt der Sohn: "Vater, was ist das?"  Der Vater: "Mein Sohn, so was habe ich im Leben noch nicht gesehen!"  Da humpelt eine kleine, h??liche, alte Dame mit einem schrumpeligen Gesicht und einem Buckel in den Aufzug. Die Tr schlie?t sich, und Vater und Sohn beobachten die Lampen ber der Tr, wie sie nacheinander aufleuchten: 12 - 13 - 14 - 15 - 14 - 13 - 12.

Wenn Sie mit etwas Milde rechnen wollen, mssen Sie uns schon eine Begrndung geben."    Der Mann: "Die war so d?mlich, die musste ich einfach erschlagen!"  Richter: "Das ist ja noch viel schlimmer. Wenn Sie nicht wollen, da? die Geschworenen Sie von vornherein schuldig sprechen sollen, dann geben Sie uns bitte eine plausible Erkl?rung."    Darauf der Mann: "Das war folgenderma?en. Wir wohnten in einem Hochhaus im 13.Stock und im ersten Stock wohnte eine reizende Portiersfamilie, die hatte drei Kinder. Es war schrecklich! Die waren so klein geblieben, von Natur aus. Der Zw?lfj?hrige war 80cm gro?, der 19-j?hrige 90cm. Ich kam eines Tages hoch  zu meiner Frau und sage: "Das ist schon was Schlimmes mit den Kindern unserer Portiersfamilie."  "Ja", sagt meine Frau, "das ist ein richtiges Pyren?engeschlecht."  Ich sage: "Nein, was Du meinst, sind Pygm?en."  "Nein", sagt meine Frau, "Pygm?en, das ist das, was der Mensch unter der Haut hat, davon kriegt er Sommersprossen."  Ich sage: "Das ist Pigment."

"Nein", sagt meine Frau, "Pergament ist, wenn ein Dichter etwas anf?ngt und nicht zu Ende macht."  Herr Richter, Sie k?nnen sich vorstellen, ich verschlucke mir das Fragment, ich setze mich in meinen Lehnstuhl und lese Zeitung.  Pl?tzlich kommt meine Frau mit einem Satz, ich denke, jetzt ist sie irrenhausreif.  "Liebling, schau mal, was hier steht!"  Sie macht ein Buch auf, zeigt auf eine Textstelle und sagt: "Das Sonnendach des Handt?schchens war die Lehrerin des Zuh?lters 15."  Ich nehme das Buch an mich und sage: "Aber Schatz, das ist ein franz?sisches Buch, da steht: La Marquise de Pompadour est la Maitresse de Lois XV. Das heisst: Die Marquise von Pompadour war die M?tresse von Ludwig dem 15."  "Nein", sagt meine Frau, "das mu?t du w?rtlich bersetzen:  La Marquise - das Sonnendach.  Pompadour - das Handt?schchen.  La Maitresse - die Lehrerin.  Lois XV - der Zuh?lter 15.  Ich mu? das schlie?lich ganz genau wissen, ich habe extra fr meinen Franz?sischunterricht einen Legion?r angestellt."  Ich sage: "Du meinst einen Lektor."  "Nein", sagt meine Frau, "Lektor war der griechische Held des Altertums."  Ich sage: "Das war Hektor, und der war Trojaner."  "Nein", sagt meine Frau, "Hektor ist ein Fl?chenma?."  Ich sage: "Das ist ein Hektar."  "Nein", sagt meine Frau, "Hektar ist der G?ttertrank."  Ich sage: "Das ist der Nektar."  "Nein", sagt meine Frau, "Nektar ist ein Flu? in Sddeutschland."  Ich sage: "Das ist der Neckar."  Darauf meine Frau: "Du kennst wohl nicht das sch?ne Lied: Bald gras ich am Nektar, bald gras ich am Rhein - das habe ich neulich mit meiner Freundin im Duo gesungen."  Ich sage: "Das hei?t Duett."  "Nein", sagt meine Frau, "Duett ist, wenn zwei M?nner mit einem S?bel aufeinander losgehen."  Ich sage: "Das ist ein Duell."  "Nein", sagt meine Frau, "Duell ist, wenn eine Eisenbahn aus einem dunklen, finsteren Bergloch herauskommt."    Herr Richter - da habe ich einen Hammer genommen und habe sie erschlagen."

If you are interested in country music, look into an interpretation of a standard that hasn't been beat to death by everyone in the genre.    Good luck on your audition, but should they not select you, don't let it keep you from your dreams!|`|z98Pedpwaa	Don't know what your range is, but I've always loved this song.  I've heard people try to sing it before, some do great with it, others butcher it.   I Believe in You from Don Williams    Good luck on your audition.  And don't listen to the American Idol people.  I've seen them reject some great voices and keep ones that reminded me of nails on a chalk board.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Yeah , try something patriotic. Like the top contributor said. I have noticed that they always respond if not positive, acceptable to patriotic songs. Give it all you've got and feel it inside you. Think about whats happening in the war and the things that are happening because of it. feel it deep down in your soul.|`|AA12343035	I'll give three, all Nitty Gritty Dirt Band songs  The Broken Road  Ripplin' Waters  If You're Ever Gonna See a Rainbow    If you've got some range, any of these might be good for you.
ImrVQbYmaa	There are throat exercies you can do. For example, making a Naw sound, if you do it right you should feel your throat vibrating. A siren sound 'oooooh weeeee' increasing in pitch and decreasing in pitch works aswell. Sing numbers 1-9 increasing in pitch, this helps make your voice stronger.  :)
AA11139157	ok, i don't think he is testing you. it seems you guys have a hate love relationship.     it seems that the both of you are very stressed out with your own situations, sometimes partners tend to take it out on each other, he may be just rteleasing tension and since he loves you, he's going to take it out on you. which is not fair but it happens, and if it gets too out of hand, you shoudl definately say something because sometimes they really don't realize it until you say something, then they'll think about it and try to fix it- if they are stubborn (like me lol) it takes a little longer to realize 'hey i am doing this wrong!'    astrology-wise i am unsure if really that has anything to do with it. i would definately look up his scorpio information that way you can learn a little more about him, it's not always precise and to the point but his sign (scorpio) may definatley help for you to better understand where he is coming from.    from personal experience, this sounds A LOT like me and my boyfreind (not that it matters but i am gay so its not a mistake when i say 'my boyfreind'). you can't always assume it's astrology though. for instance me and my boyfriend go through very similar arguments and i am a leo and he is a gemini (my rising sign is scorpio which means i have scorpio attributes) so i can kind of understand where your boyfriend is coming from. - first off, scorpios tend to hide their emotions (i do it all the time), but deep down inside its tearing htem apart, scorpios are also vey snappy, especially when arguing we wil stay calm the whole time until our inner emotions take over and we snap very harshly. sometimes i hang up the phone on my boyfreind (when we are arguing) becausee either 1) i am majorly pissed at him and i don't want the argument to escalde 2)i might say something extrememly mean and hurt his feelings in turn (knowing how he is) he will be that much more mad at me 3)i give up, tired of arguing 4) to piss him off even more (scorpio trait [vengefulness and seeking revenge])    personally i do not beleive he is testing you he is just frustrated and tired, he isn't working, he might embaressed about it, he might feel he's not a good person because he can't help support you right now. he may feel like you  can better than him (these are thoughts that pop in my head with my boyfriend and i am sharing them with you so that you might see where he's coming from)-    i also think that my boyfriend is always cheating on me. difference is my boyfreind did cheat on me in the beginning of our relationship and i forgave him, but it does enter my mind constantly especially when we argue and he leaves for hours, it does cross my mind. it might cross his mind too. he might think 'o she'll find someone else'.     if the both of you are meant to be, it will work out just fine, from what i read, it seems like you guys are stressed out, the arguing is getting worse adn you really don't know.  communication is the key, slways say what is on your mind, and pick your battles wisely, th ebest of luck to you :-)|`|IVy35SE2aa	Scorpio is a very emotional sign and probably the most difficult  sign to live in the zodiac.  They are capable of holding two different  positions on a subject. Usually they are secretive, jealous and  controlling.  It is, I am told, the only sign with 2 symbols.  The  scorpion which will sting even itself, and the Eagle which soars  above everything else.  Billy Graham was cited as an eagle type.    You see how changeable he is. He can't help it.  He will probably  stay that way.

IVy35SE2aa	the daily horoscopes are fun to read but have very little reality.  They are very general and can give some indication about what  you might encounter on this day.  What your mood might be.  The last line is saying that on that day you might feel that  a friend is a lover, not just a friend.|`|0TuWYaneaa	Its all a made up bunch of crap,that's what it means.

They had to be stoned.

HqcH85SMaa	Keith is Roman Catholic and Nichole was originally Roman Catholic because she got married in the church that she and her family attended for over 20 years.   I don't know if she changed religion when she married Tom Cruise.    Kidman is a practising Catholic. She attended Mary Mackillop Chapel in North Sydney. During her marriage to Cruise, she had been an occasional practitioner of Scientology.  As for religion, Keith and Nicole have stated that they are Roman Catholic.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Yeah, so what ? if that's their trip. Then so be it.|`|z98Pedpwaa	Yes, he was Roman Catholic, she converted.  She was into Scientology with Tom, and then they got divorced.  Under the "laws" of the Roman Catholic church her and Kieth shouldn't have been able to get married because she got a divorce, but the Roman Catholic church also doesn't consider Scientology a religion, so they chalked it up to she was never married.    Edit:  I think you may be right.  I think she was raised Catholic.  But the story I heard when her and Keith got married was that she became a scientologest when she married Tom, then divorced him, and returned to the church when she got engaged to Keith.  I heard it on TMZ though, so I doubt its that reliable.|`|xM0yznxgaa	Good country music question,I just can't get the tune or melody right.Could be I have no idea what the song is,or how it relates to country music.
wHmgVhphaa	By hand.    Like the editor would cut out parts of the movie and connect or SPLICE them together with other parts creating scenes.  This is why, I believe, takes from earlier movies last so long.  They didn't have the technology to continuously cut back and forth back and forth all the time.    Also things like titles were hand made as well like painted directly onto film.

Zach will cover for Kendall and he'll get off scotfree as usual.    Bianca will return to Paris after she finds out that Reese and Zack hooked up and Kendall will let all hell break loose.

AA12242325	i love that show too, but i can't imagine that it would translate well into a two hour movie.  i think that part of the charm of the show is that it condensed what could be a movie length feature into 30 min.
5M0FBU89aa	It's a clever reply to something said that was meant to be "clever" -    Watch out though, a lot of people don't like being "out-clevered" -    Unless the first person made an insulting remark in which case use your best judgement... This is called the "dump and run" strategy;  when someone insults you with something clever then changes the subject.    In which case, you have every right to say, like "Whoa.. back to what you just said...."

BWS6oSJTaa	Fakes, posers...... people who try to act all tough, when in real life you could probably beat them up no prob, and they are wimps.

AIq4Zy6oaa	Lucy. No contest.    1) She's even more ruthless than he is; he likes to play God and gloat, but she just likes to slaughter. She would rip him to itty bitty shreds before he even knew she wanted to.     2) Even if Light had time to find out/write down her name, she wouldn't die immediately since there's a 40-second lapse between when a name is written in the Death Note and when the person dies. That's plenty of time for Lucy to slice him up.    3) He could buy himself some time by staying out of her 2-meter reach, but he's not much of a fighter - and she's shown herself to be fast, strong, and ruthless in battle. She would catch him easily.    Plus, the only weapon Light's ever used is a gun, and crappily at that. Lucy can deflect bullets from trained marksmen.|`|HeuupLhSaa	Well that would depend because if it was a head on battle then i think lucy would win because could decapitate light before he could right anything. But if light was hiding then he would because well yea all he has to do is see her to know her full name then bam    i like lucy more

La trama es la historia de un robo pero a aparte de la originalidad del guin (todos son siempre sospechosos pero no sabes porqu) tiene una forma de explicar la historia con idas y venidas en el tiempo (flashbacks) que la hacen q ests ms atento.

5b761b8d18486a083fcaf2c7fa0c309daa	In May of 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Daron Malakian has confirmed the break will probably last a few years, but insists that the band is not splitting up. He told MTV, "We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We've done System for over ten years, and I think it's healthy for us to get away from it for a while and come back to it later on. So, this is probably going to be... well, it's not a farewell tour, but it's going to be a little while before we go out again." He adds, "I'll always be a member of System of a Down. That will never change. There isn't a rule that says you have to make records constantly, like clockwork, to continue being who you are." Malakian claims that he needs a break from the band because he wants to live his life more. He has written the majority of the music for the band for ten straight years.[1]    On July 8th, while playing Lonely Day, Malakian improvised the lyrics to, "Such a lonely day, with the band/I love these guys right here." Tankian quickly followed that by stating "everybody should mind their own business!"[citation needed] During their performance in Houston, Malakian also took a moment to say, "There's been a lot of rumors about us breaking up. Well don't ******* listen to them. Us four right here, we will always be System of a Down!"[citation needed]    During the hiatus, Malakian will be in a band called Scars on Broadway, and will have its debut album out in fall[citation needed]. Odadjian might be participating in this. Tankian plans to keep recording as a solo artist in "Serjical Strike", while Dolmayan plans to open a comic book store online, which should be up online in November 2007[citation needed].    System of a Down's final performance before their hiatus took place on August 13, 2006 in West Palm Beach, Florida. "Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together," Malakian told the crowd during Sunday's last performance. "We'll be back. We just don't know when."|`|0804c57a69860229320748d0277bbbf6aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAD|`|cc40098b3bc3b9f42aefa1af7aa7046eaa	http://www.soad1.co.nr|`|026ca8a07d3e1d2a94806bf3332d072faa	If they were releasing a new album, I will buy about 100 copies just so I can burn them.

Croce's classmate decided to go AWOL and return to pick up a paycheck. When the military police arrested him, he talked up a blue streak and Croce saw how "bad" the man was.|`|758ac53ab19478c168253f9f10a138b4aa	He's the baddest man in the whole damn town.|`|5b761b8d18486a083fcaf2c7fa0c309daa	Jim Croche said that he was in a coffee shoppe and he was listening to these guy talk about a guy who was pretty tough and so he decide to write a song about him.

All that glitters is gold is probably referring to Lord of the Rings.  there is a poem about aragorn that says "All that is gold does not glitter" The blackmarket things is crap but Dom is on the right path.  Stairway to heaven is most likely a reference from the bible about Jacobs Ladder.|`|58ee9f5c170a53879439b19205234d38aa	Read between the lines. It was written with many diff. meanings actually.

You can interpret it to what makes sense for you, that is how he wrote.  cheers|`|5b761b8d18486a083fcaf2c7fa0c309daa	This song was written by robert plant in front of his fire place, and Pagey, at his house (the one that once was owned by Alice Crowly). To figure out what this means you can start by listing to it backwards. From what i gatherd it is about HOPE, and THE MISLEADING POWERS OF SAITAN. Backmasked, on the track, over and over he says "satan, sweet satan. Whoe's path would make me so sad; and it was in that tool shed (page's house) he maid us suffer, SAD SATAN!!" If you mix this into the song it frequently talks about people being led, and the two paths (something common in the bible). I got the idea that it was about Hope from Robert plant himself. Before the song remains the same concert he says, "i think this is a sog about hope.|`|AA11734390	I think the "lady" is committing suicide.

Foi apartir das investiga??es da causa do acidente em que as autoridades da Aeronutica e Infraero concluram que os operadores de v?os estavam trabalhando acima da meta estipulada pela avia??o nacional e internacional.

O trfego areo cresceu muito e o nmero de controladores n?o acompanhou esse ritmo...  Porm, acho que nesse caso do avi?o da Gol, tem mais rela??o com a"bolha" que existe na faixa de transi??o entre as centrais de comando do trfego areo... o chamado cindacta!  Naquela regi?o onde houve o acidente,  justamente onde exise uma faixa de transi??o entre duas centrais de opera??es do cindacta...  como tentar falar ao celular no elevador, ou na garagem do prdio...  Esse buraco na comunica??o, impossibilitando contatos entre os avi?es e as torres de comando, somados  alguma falha humana, resultaram na tragdia que assistimos...  O lado positivo, se  que existe algum,  a possibilidade de reparar essa falha pra que mais vidas humanas n?o sejam perdidas.|`|d2877d909d4e08e375b2ea9e01d8750caa	Primeiro: N?o est?o "faltando" controladores.

A nica coisa que eles est?o fazendo  seguir a risca os regulamentos e controlar, no mximo, 14 avi?es en?o 20 como vinham fazendo.  Segundo: J ficou provado que o Legacy voou 30 minutos sem se comunicar com a torre e que foi tentada 7 vezes essa comunica??o.  Terceiro: acho que essa histria de culpar as torres  bode expiatrio j que tem americano envolvido no rolo.  Quarto: ser controlador de v?o aqui no Brasil, alm de extremamente estressante,  mal remunerada e sem maiores perspectivas de progress?o funcional.  Quinto: aquartelar os controladores n?o vai adiantar nada, pelo contrrio. Eles ficaram ainda mais revoltados e quem sofrer s?o os usurios.

2013624a9d8ffdf155510ef2a1113affaa	The band members are as follows..    Vocals: Lauri Yl?nen  Guitarist: Pauli Rantasalmi  Drums: Aki Hakala  Bassist: Eero Heinonen    Lauri ylonen  The lead singer. He was born as Lauri Johannes Yl?nen in Helsinki on April 23, 1979. Lauri is one of the main song writers and has also worked on various collaborations with fellow Finns Apocalyptica and Ville Valo from the band HIM. He has also worked in the production of music for fellow Dynasty members Killer and Kwan, together with bandmate Pauli.     Pauli Rantasalmi  Is the guitarist of The Rasmus. His full name is Pauli Esko Antero Rantasalmi, born on May 1, 1979 in Helsinki. He produces and manages other bands, such as Killer and Kwan. Pauli also plays the kantele, although not in the band.  Pauli also owns a studio called the grotto, and runs a record label called "Dynasty Recordings" along with Lauri Ylonen, which both Kwan and the vonHertzen Brothers are signed to.    Aki Hakala  The drummer. His full name is Aki Markus Hakala and he was born in Espoo, Finland, on October 28, 1979. He joined the band in 1999, after the former drummer, Janne Heiskanen, left. Aki originally sold band merchandise at their shows and joined the band after "jamming" with Pauli. He says that the only thing he was ever good at was drumming, and he "sucked at everything else", although he has done some acting in the past in "Siamin tyt?t" (a Finnish drama series) and can play the guitar. Before joining The Rasmus, he was a drummer for Killer and Kwan (he was replaced by Risto).  At the beginning of the summer, Aki decided to finally get eye surgery, and now no longer needs his trademark black glasses.     Eero Heinonen  The bassist. He was born as Eero Aleksi Heinonen in Helsinki, Finland, on November 27, 1979. Eero is a great fan of Sahaja Yoga and is a quiet and well-balanced person, but also the greatest friend of playing tricks on bandmates and others. He is currently the only member of the band who is married and he is also a father of two children. After playing for Korpi Ensemble for many years he now has a new side project since 2004 called Hay and Stone, where he is bass player and lead singer. Eero also plays the violin.

I ignored my wife's not-so-subtle hints about completing certain jobs around the house, but I didn't realize how much this bothered her until the clothes dryer refused to work, the iron shorted and the sewing machine motor burned out in the middle of a seam. The final straw came when she plugged in the vacuum cleaner and nothing happened.     She looked so stricken that I had to offer some consolation.     "That's okay, honey," I said. "You still have me."     She looked up at me with tears in her eyes. "Yes," she wailed, "but you don't work either!"

He can access a "pocket dimension" psionically in order to produce guns, grenades, or ammunition instantaneously. By using both hands in conjunction with his power, he can create apertures large enough for assault rifles, or even a small RPG. The Gunman can also use his interdimensional access in order to teleport, but he can only teleport as far as he can see. I would probably have him as more of an "anti-hero" like the Punisher, but I think it could work.

That way, a lot more time could be freed for paying attention on how to ban hunger and poverty in the world (okay, that will take at least 100 years, I know), and  time could also be freed for studying ways on how to stop global warning, without hindering growth of economy!|`|a89945ce4361fda1640143010bd1f97baa	how about PERFECTMAN. his super hero powers are: ability to wash dishes, do laundry, and vacuum!

1e26dba25e74a789dba41d5b5b854acfaa	Com certeza, N?O....    Leiam o contedo do site que coloquei o link e vejam, a Globo vem manipulando a opini?o pblica e reescrevendo as notcias desde a Ditadura Militar (que s durou 21 anos gra?as a Globo que apoiava e engana o povo).  Hoje as outras emissoras j s?o grandes o bastante para conseguir uma boa cobertura nacional e internacional, e n?o possuem vnculo com o Governo para deixar de denunciar (como a Globo faz) as falcatruas.  Se a Globo quisesse ela teria derrubado o FHC pelas suas falcatruas e desmandos, mas prefiriu proteg-lo, fazendo uma imagem de presidente bom e honesto... o LULA tambm, a Globo n?o debateu sobre a Corrup??o, ela dava a notcia, mas n?o dava seu parecer nem cobrava respostas do governo...  Ela s derrubou o COLLOR pois ele estava pra abrir uma rede maior que ela e colocando em risco o Imprio... n?o foi s pela corrup??o, tratava-se de interesses...    Ent?o abra o olho, se o William Bonner disse que o esteretipo do telespectador  do Jornal Nacional era igual ao Homer Simpson ( http://www.cartacapital.com.br/index.php... ), ent?o vocs acham que a Globo vai transmitir a notcia integral? A Globo fica iludindo as pessoas com suas novelas onde tudo  lindo e maravilhoso, onde trai??o n?o  pecado, onde dormir com uma pessoa que voc n?o conhece bem  a coisa mais noprmal do mundo... Agora me digam, o que ela ganha com isso? Um povo sem cultura, um povo que n?o sabe distinguir o certo do errado, adolescentes que engravidam e deixam de estudar e ficam mais ignorantes a cada dia...

It may be just a case of the grass being greener?|`|45bb78b24894618f299c590c619aff39aa	don't do it from experiance nothing good can come out of it the two guys will not be friends anymore|`|32fb94506f192b6388a4929263e499d0aa	i wont tell you to forget you boyfriends best friend, but i will tell you to mature. What you need to think about is your boyfriends feelings, would you want him to dump you for your bestfriend? Plus a guy will always pick his friend over a girl....if your thinking about dumping your boyfriend and dating his friend that wont happen...i suggest you dump your boyfriend, and just move on! because you are just going to be causing drama.....|`|12a8efe9ad8fd4e71c395f19aeb29304aa	OK, first thing you do is find a nice big cave, then, stock it really good with food and water. Then move into it and don't come out until you stop being fickle. I have a huge crush on Jessica Simpson, but that does not stop me from having a serious relationship. Get over the immaturity, and everything else falls into place.

925685c24171f86ff9e707691bba7f90aa	There are probably several things but the most important is that a digital piano uses weighted keys to give the feel and response of a real piano. It provides the resistence and feel so the person will learn the techniques that are needed to play on a real piano.  Yamaha makes a great digital piano that professionals use for about 3K|`|AA10028372	In some ways they are the same in that the portable keyboard may have a piano sound.  A digital piano, however, usually has better sounding pianos, has keys that tend to feel like the action of a real piano and may have a soft pedal along with a sustain pedal.      The two kinds of keyboards can compliment each other when the portable keyboard is used for an instrument other than a piano such as a solo instrument or a background pad for the piano.  Many of the digital pianos have other sounds such as electric pianos, clav type instruments and even vibraphones.  The digital piano though is basically a piano with the advantages of never having to be tuned, able to be moved easily and able to fit in a smaller area than a real piano. The advantages of a portable keyboard are that it can play several types of musical instruments, may be able to store songs and play them, and may contain arrangement types of accompaniment for several music genres.

There were monitors around before the camera such as wave form and vectorscope monitors so that engineers could see visual images of electronic activity within an electronic system such as radio. They used these when researching how to capture moving images i.e. the TV camera, we still use them for monitoring the technical quality of the pictures we produce. But in terms of what the general public knows as a TV monitor it was developed concurrently with the camera. The picture was captured on a tube converted into signal sent down a cable and then reproduced on the tube in the TV.  I've just had this debate with one of our technical directors our news director and some other staff and the majority say the monitor or TV in it's crudest form came before the camera.  Hope this helps.|`|834e49d3bae86765bd01b3e28aa519dbaa	the tv camera is probably little different if at all from a movie camera, and movies predate TV, so i would have to say the camera was first...  not quite on par with the chicken vs egg question....|`|565493bfa842837db5f90e86301aced8aa	Hahaha.

77aa5159d81c26e55cc4e79c94a7bb55aa	Several of my family members are Leos. I know EXACTLY what you're talking about. Honey, unfortunately, a Leo can grieve themselves to death. Put it this way, the female Leo in my family took 13 years after her spouse died before she even thought about another relationship.  Once a Leo gives their heart to someone, they give their WHOLE heart and once scorned it can take a very long time to repair. They generally will need a friend to help them through the bad times and then will tend to lean on the one that stuck with them through thick and thin. Leo males in my family are this way as well. When they've been scorned, they may go from one girlfriend to another until they find the right one and settle down. This just keeps them from being hurt again.|`|ea299139b13dd070cf077635bd7da94daa	This is going to sound crazy but bear with me.  I am a leo who broke up with her gemini boyfriend almost 18 years ago because we were 19 years old and my parents hated him.  Now, both us of married to others with children, I know I still love him and never stopped. I had relationships with others, married twice because I wanted the stability and had children, but there has been one real love in my life.  Leos love deeply.  If you want love with a Leo I'm sorry to say it has to come from them -- we are a selfish and proud group and its not easy to make us love others.|`|3cc58491f9ddfd5a9280ac405dd41652aa	I'm a leo (8/10/82) and I've only had 2 big break-ups the first one I let it go and it didn't take me much time to get back into things but the second one was pretty rough. It took me a good 6 months to regroup and realize there is a BIG sea out there. My suggestion to you is not to believe in the horoscope of it but just understand you fell for 2 idiots. If they don't know how to move on now then expect the relationship to go into failure later...hope this helps.|`|b526651f76b915880216ad7ce99c763baa	I wouldn't listen to that clown.  ;)    Leos are very stubborn and they also want to believe the best in everyone, so when the one they love breaks their heart it's very hard for them to put it together again.      Leos have very big hearts and they break very hard.     Of course I wouldn't expect a Gemini to understand because Geminis can intellectualize their emotions to the point they can talk themselves right out of feeling anything.      Leos aren't like that.|`|b999da2b28720988492336e47e658458aa	im a leo  if i was the one that got dumped, i would probly wait for a while  but if i was the dumper, i would start dating again anytime lol|`|d59eee0b9ad03093b828dcfe1ba0024faa	they dont usually take a long time to get replacement... but they also dont fall in love that easily.  its quite hard to understand how they really feel cos of their ego not to show or express it. i've been with quite a number of leos in my life, best galfren a leo, best guy friend a leo. U just gotta spend time with them, crack  them up but never say u want to be their girlfrend unless they are the one who make the first move. Just be good frens and u'll be surprised how things will turn out.|`|e36e5faac1b2f9d2b387c9ef7ab0c4d3aa	Leos are full of pride. We like to take time out for ourselves... We're just as happy out of a relationship than we are inside one.     This is just a generic statement... Not all leos are the same. Personally, I like to take time for myself after a break up to find what makes me happy without the need for another person in my life. Once I find happiness on my own, I know I'm ready to start again.    Unfortunately, the time frame for that varies from person to person and situation to situation.

HAPPY B-DAY|`|bd78eed68ed28940a82ab75bb1d8ff1baa	DESTINY SAID NEITHER   HAPPY BIRTHDAY BOB BRYAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|572b5f93a152a8753d47c71bafb92d0aaa	Robert Cory Bryar (as stated himself) was born December 31, 1979 in Chicago, Illinois) is the drummer for My Chemical Romance      (HAPPY B-DAY ROBERT)      OTHER SH!t:    Born in Chicago, he joined the band in 2004 while working as a sound engineer for The Used, through whom he became friends with the members of My Chemical Romance. He first met them when The Used went on tour with My Chemical Romance. Frank Iero, guitarist in My Chemical Romance said on the DVD Life on the Murder Scene: "Bob and Toro are the two hardest working people I've ever met, and if there is a God, I thank him everyday for bringing us Bob." My Chemical Romance has also said Bob Bryar has taught them to "not take any **** from anybody."    He replaced Matt Pelissier when Pelissier left the band, after being a soundman for The Used for a few years. The video for "I'm Not Okay (I Promise)" was filmed with Bob drumming before he became an "official" member of the band. He attended university in Gainesville, Florida and has previously worked at Disney World as a drummer. When he attended Eisenhower Junior High in Darien, Illinois he played drums in symphonic and jazz bands.      In a clip from the making of the video "Welcome to the Black Parade", he said that he was working on a solo project, and all of the songs were written about Gerard. This became widely joked about amongst MCR fans. He sang into a microphone, "Oh Gerard, Oh Gerard, you make my heart burn,"    In the filming of the music video for "Famous Last Words", the 13th track on MCR's new album The Black Parade, the back of the set is burning, and near the end Bob's leg was badly burnt. He ignores it for the last 30-40 seconds of the shoot, but at the end of one version of the video, he can be seen mouthing "I can't take this ******* heat anymore" and then running out of his seat, looking at his leg, and then running more. Because of this, he suffered third degree burns. He later got gangrene from his wounds, which led to a staph infection.

02136a888676ac5f02590c5ea7bc5360aa	Leo is the Fifth sign of the Zodiac. Its name may derive from the Latin leo or the Greek leon, both of which mean "lion." However, the name is likely Semitic in origin...from the Hebrew word, labi. Leo is known as the "royal sign," symbolic of exuberance and leadership, and individuals who fall within its jurisdiction place courage and personal honesty above all else. Others may not necessarily fulfill the expectations of a Leo native and thus, the life of a Leo is often rife with disappointments. There is a radiant warmth associated with this Zodiac Sign which emanates from the Leo personality to touch the hearts of friends and admirers. This fortunate personality trait is apt to open many doors in life and the individual ruled by Leo welcomes both authority and responsibility. The fiery temperament of a Leo subject is typical of the Zodiac's fire group...fire being the element which rules this sign. There are few people who fail to be attracted to the Leos of this world since they are indeed likeable individuals, being frank, open, honest and endearing. Of all the Zodiac Signs, it is Leo which is most known for dedication to an ideal. There is a tendency here toward a drowning in egocentricity and materialism, coupled with a lack of both the desire and the capacity for spiritual development. Thus, those born under the Sign of Leo should strive to avoid the type of exaggeration that can debase their many inherent gifts.    The symbol...or glyph...of Leo has, since ancient times, been likened to the mane of a lion, or even its tail. However, it has also been thought to represent the two valves of the heart...the area of the body which Leo rules. Yet other interpretations of the glyph are that it is representative of the "serpent power" or creative force of the body in its coiled or dormant form, or that it symbolizes the heat or creative energy of the Sun, the celestial body which governs this Zodiac Sign. In Vedic Astrology, this glyph represents creativity and childbirth, likened to a sperm cell which is the creative power of life and heralds its beginning.    Also known as the Sign of the King or President, Leo is Positive in polarity (as are Aries, Gemini, Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius). The general characteristics of Positive Signs broadly match those for the extrovert personality and such individuals are naturally more impulsive, buoyant, communicative and sociable than are the Zodiac Signs of Negative polarity (Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces). However, Positive Signs rarely display the same levels of sensitivity or the same depth of understanding of emotional subtleties as do their Negative counterparts. Positive Signs tend to crave excitement and thus, are inclined to direct their energies outward into the world around them. Aries is the most flagrantly extrovert of the Positive Signs (with Sagittarius a close second).All Zodiac Signs governed by the Elements of Fire and Air are considered to be Masculine in nature. Thus, Leo (ruled by fire) is considered Masculine (as are Aries, Gemini, Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius). Masculine signs are traditionally conceived as being more active and less receptive than their Feminine counterparts which are ruled by the Elements of Earth and Water (the Zodiac Signs of Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces). Masculine Signs focus primarily on spirituality and activity...both in the physical sense and mental sense. Masculine Signs are said to be diurnal or day-oriented. Therefore the term "masculine" should be viewed in the same light as the Yang (or bright) Polarity of the Tao.Leo is the natural ruler of the Fifth House of the Zodiac, often referred to as the "House of Pleasure" and known in Vedic Astrology as the "Good Fortune." This is the field of experience in which an individual is challenged to develop creativity and self-esteem...and to find joy in living. Essentially, it deals with fun, games, gambling, playing, acting, drama, hobbies, the theater and the use or misuse of creative energies. The side of an individual which is reserved for play...the side which only emerges when there is fun to be had and the work is done...resides in the Fifth House. By its very nature, this House reflects the charming and delightful side of an individual...where hobbies, interests and playmates may be found. In short, if something provides a person with joy, then it will be preserved in the Fifth House. By tradition, this House is associated with children, enthusiasm, creativity and motivation, as well as love affairs...both legal and illicit. The influence of the Fifth House creates a sense of excitement and the craving of pleasure. It also allows an individual to see a little of himself or herself in what has been personally created...anything from the smile of a son or daughter to a piece of artwork. The Fifth House is governed by the Planet Sun...not truly a "planet" since it is a star, but classified as such for the purposes of continuity in the science of astrology.  The opposite sign to Leo is Aquarius. From Aquarius, Leo can learn to share in a caring manner and occasionally leave "center stage" to others. Thus, can Leo natives learn to stand alone and value themselves.  Positive Traits: generous, honest, warm-hearted, magnanimous, broad-minded, expansive, loving, proud, enthusiastic and creative with a flair for showmanship and drama  Negative Traits: pompous, patronising, bossy, interferring, dogmatic, intolerant, bullying, conceited, snobbish and power-mad  Likes: speculative ventures, lavish living, rich food, children, drama, pageantry and grandeur  Dislikes: doing anything safely, day-to-day living, small-minded people, penny-pinching and mean spiritedness  Spiritual Goal:  To learn the true meaning of love  Spiritual Correspondence:  The Powers  Apostle:  John  Prophet:  Hosea  Anatomy:  Rules the heart, cardiac system, upper back and upper spine |`|c1dd18056c7abba38eb5d58766843f06aa	From my experience, often good looking and therefore sometimes up themselves. They are out going, probably good at sports. They will lie to get what they want and also boast and/or lie about themselves and their achievements. They are loyal to their (worthy) mates. However, once they grow up a bit (around 30) and meet the right person they commit whole heartedly and make great husbands and fathers. He has to find that woman that he is completely 'taken by'. If this is not you, run away.  A lot of Leo men cheat on their partners also.|`|72c715b1407f197c1a530719259a3a3eaa	Leo guys are hot!

Leo is a fire sign which loves attention and has alot of pride. He readily make friends and his idealistic and gentlemanly manners makes him attractive and popular. The Taurus female is elegant, down to earth and realistic. This complements Leo's needs perfectly. But because both are outspoken and stubborn, the long term compatibility really depends on your own efforts. If your financial position is good you will attract the Lion however, this partner will want the freedom to roam.     TAURUS WOMEN IN LOVE  She is a da Vinci in the art of seduction. From her Mona Lisa smile to the sensual look in her eyes, she is a consummate mistress of love. However, she is not promiscuous and any hopeful male who picks up her seductive signal had better turn off his antenna if all he wants is a casual affair. Taurus woman is not a lady for a day, or even for a weekend. Her need is for security and stability, and casual is not a word in her vocabulary of love.    In many ways Taurus woman is the perfect personification of the old-fashioned woman, for she is devoted and protective, a natural earth mother who loves and nurtures and gives of her strength. She is also earth in her passionsonce she falls in love. Being in love brings out the best in her. She isn't coy or provocative in a love relationship. She is open, affectionate, and demonstrative with the man she cares for, and her sexual appetite borders on the lusty.    If she loves you, nothing anybody can say against you will affect her in the slightest degree. She has a secure sense of her own judgment and her own needs, and she trusts her instincts.    A passionate bed partner and a devoted mate, Taurus woman has a great deal to offer. But she demands a lot in return. She believes in giving her all and taking all she can get. No bargain hunters need apply.    She likes to be pursued and wooedbut is never really won. She makes up her own mind long before what you may consider the decisive moment. She plans ahead, for she doesn't believe such an important matter as sex should be left entirely to chance. The stage is set carefully. Every attention will be given to detail, for the woman born under this sign is marvelous at detail. While you preen yourself or your supposed conquest, she never lets you know that you never had a choice.    Taurus woman is a true romanticserene, unaffected, sexy, artistic, good-natured, yet with elegance and taste. If you capture this woman's fancy, count yourself blessed.    LEO MEN IN LOVE  He falls in love readily, then finds it hard to sustain the emotion. for him, falling out of love is as simple as falling out of bed.    Don't make the mistake of thinking Leo man is casual about love. he isn't; in fact, he sees love in practically mythical terms. To him, a love affair is never minor or mild or murky. It is high drama; it is a grand passion. No one else in the zodiac can more easily make you believe that you and he are the first, original, quintessential lovers in the world. The woman who wins his favor moves instantly to center stage. The spotlight is on her, she rates in the bright circle of his admiration. It's a heady experience to have a Leo lover. Then suddenly the lights are turned off, the curtain falls, the play is overand she doesn't know why. And he won't explain. Most likely, it's because Leo was in love with a mythical creature of his imaginationa beautiful adoring princess completely fulfilled by him. When the real woman supersedes the myth, Leo gets on his white horse and rides off.    Leo man likes a woman to cater to his every whim. Yet he would be surprised to hear himself described as demanding. He doesn't see himself that way at all. He thinks he is openhearted, trusting, asking nothing but what he is entitled to. If told that he sometimes asks too much of those close to him, he simply wouldn't understand how. After all, why should anyone refuse him? In pleasing him, they please themselves. A true democrat, he believes everyone is equalequally ready to serve him.    If this sounds like an overweeningly self-assured type riding for a fall, look a bit closer. Underneath Leo's surface majesty is a sensitive, vulnerable man who needs reassuranceand praise. Praise is as necessary to him as food and drink.    In sexual relationships he won't voyage beyond the farthest limits of the known to find a new continent of sensuality. He's a cautious navigator who sticks close to charted waters. On the other hand, a woman will never end up with a sunken wreck.    If you rub his mane the right way, Leo the Lion is a marvelously affectionate, cheerful companion. He is kind, strong, generous, something of a spendthrift but usually successful in business. A woman who gets this flamboyant, magnetic overachiever with the sunny disposition has only one problem. Somehow she has to teach him that the sole object of his adulation does not have to be himself.

301b8e82bcf240fb15852e2d4f50b0a3aa	Well. Let me try to laugh you by offering you 10 Good Jokes. Here are they.    Three girls all worked in the same office with the same female boss, each day, they noticed the boss left work early.     One day, the girls decided that, when the boss left, they would leave right behind her. After all, she never called or came back to work, so how would she know they went home early?     The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening, spent playtime with her son, and went to bed early.     The redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the spa before meeting a dinner date.     The blonde was happy to get home early and surprise her husband, but when she got to her bedroom, she heard a muffled noise from inside. Slowly and quietly, she cracked open the door and was horrified to see her husband in bed with her boss! Gently, she closed the door and crept out of her house.     The next day, at their coffee break, the brunette and redhead planned to leave early again, and they asked the blonde if she was going to go with them.     "No way," the blonde exclaimed. " I almost got caught yesterday!"   ______________________________________...    Blond and Blue     A blond man showed up at work one day with a black eye. When his co- workers saw him they asked him what had happened. He told them it had happened at church. They didn't believe him, and wanted to know what really happened.     So he told them, "I went to the church. I got on my knees and prayed. When I stood up to sing the hymns, there in front of me was the biggest woman I had ever seen. Her dress was stuck in her butt-crack, so being the gentleman I am, I reached over and pulled it out for her. She did not like that, so she hit me." The guys laughed and ribbed him about it all day.     The next week he showed up to work and his face was beat bad! Again the guys asked him what had happened and he told them he'd got beaten up at church. Again they didn't believe him, so he explained, "I went to the church. I got on my knees and prayed. When I stood up to sing the hymns, there in front of me was that same big woman with her dress again stuck up her butt-crack."     At this point the other men interrupted and said, "Please tell us you didn't pull her dress out of her crack again?"     "No, the guy standing beside me did, and I knew she didn't like that, so I shoved it back in."  ______________________________________...    Blonde in a Circle     A blonde had just gotten a new sports car and was out for a drive when she accidentally cut off a large truck. The driver was outraged and was eventually able to make her pull over.     He got out of his truck and pulled a piece of chalk from his pocket. He drew a circle on the side of the road and gruffly commanded to the blonde in his most threatening voice, "Stand in that circle and DON'T MOVE!"     He then went to her car and cut up her leather seats.     When he turned around she had a slight grin on her face, so he said, "Oh you think that's funny? Watch this!"     He gets a baseball bat out of his truck and breaks every window in her car.     When he turns and looks at her she has a smile on her face.     Now he's getting really mad. He gets his knife back out and slices all her tires.     Now she's laughing.     The truck driver is really starting to lose it. He goes back to his truck and gets an extra can of diesel fuel, pours it on her car and sets it on fire.     He turns around and she is laughing so hard she is about to fall down.     "What's so funny?" the truck driver asked the blonde.     She replied, "Every time you weren't looking, I stepped outside the circle!"  ______________________________________...    Blondes Dept     The Blondes at the university were tired of not fitting in. They were tired of other students assuming they were just stupid bimbos. They wanted somewhere where they felt they belonged.     So they pressured the administration to set up a new Department especially for them. The university agreed, and set up the Blonde Education Department.     The Blondes were ecstatic to have a department of their own where they could gather without being ridiculed. They felt they really belonged now.     They wanted other students to see that they weren't just stupid bimbos -- after all, they now had their own department at the university.     So they now all proudly wear the official sweatshirt of the Blonde Education Department, which sports the saying: "I Belong in B.E.D."  ______________________________________...    Ralph works hard at the plant and spends two nights each week bowling  and plays golf every Saturday. His wife thinks he's pushing himself too  hard, so for his birthday she takes him to a local strip club.      The doorman at the club greets them and says, "Hey, Ralph! How ya'  doin"?  His wife is puzzled and asks if he's been to this club before.  "Oh no," says  Ralph. "He's on my bowling team."      When they are seated, a waitress asks Ralph if he'd like his usual and  brings over a Budweiser. His wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable  and says,"How did she know that you drink Budweiser?"  "I recognize her, she's the waitress from the golf club. I always have  Bud at the end of the 1st nine, Honey."      A stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around  Ralph, starts to rub herself all over him and says, "Hi Ralphy. Want  your usual table dance, big boy?"     Ralph's wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club.  Ralph follows and spots her getting into a cab. Before she can slam the  door, he jumps in beside her. Ralph trie|`|64e69f7e2c0b043bda468686999d3d76aa	Please.

b7e0823b34ba871b9a00d11ec0b89da1aa	My buddy and I used pants each other (pull the others pants down in public) and yell "Check me out!".  Well we were in the middle of a dept. store and it was the perfect chance.  I yelled "check me out" and yank, down went my buddies pants.  I had a few laughs when he turned to me and said "Alright mother f***er just wait, I'm gonna get you when you least expect it!" So that night we went to a high sch**l football game to see my girlfriend( I just grad) it was the biggest football game in the area and there had to be at least 15,000 people there.  Well we are watching the game in front of the highsch**l band at the 20 yard line right at the field and the ball is right in front of us, which means almost all of the 15,000 fans are looking right where we are.....when all of the sudden i hear the most dreaded "CHECK ME OUT!!!!!"  All of the sudden I feel cool brisk fall air on parts that I shouldn't feel it.  Not only did my buddy get my pants, but also my boxers all the way down and what made matters worse I was wearing a belt and it took a good minute or two to get them back up!

The transpose on that is used to make the tone of the keyboard higher or lower.  Eg...when I play 'Desperado'....I play it in F major.  I find it easier to sing in E flat however, so I use the transpose to lower the key by 2 values so although I am still playing in F major on the keyboard, the sound is pitched in E flat.    Hope that makes sense.

Set them free at the break of dawn  'Til one by one, they were gone.  Back at base, bugs in the software  Flash the message, Something's out there.  Floating in the summer sky.  99 red balloons go by.       99 Luftballons  Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont  Hielt man fuer UFOs aus dem All  Darum schickte ein General  Eine Fliegerstaffel hinterher  Alarm zu geben, wenn es so war  Dabei war da am Horizont  Nur 99 Luftballons       99 red balloons.  floating in the summer sky.  Panic bells, it's red alert.  There's something here from somewhere else.  The war machine springs to life.  Opens up one eager eye.  Focusing it on the sky.

To worry, worry, super-scurry.  Call the troops out in a hurry.  This is what we've waited for.  This is it boys, this is war.  The president is on the line  As 99 red balloons go by.         99 Kriegsminister  Streichholz und Benzinkanister  Hielten sich fuer schlaue Leute  Witterten schon fette Beute  Riefen: Krieg und wollten Macht  Mann, wer haette das gedacht  Dass es einmal soweit kommt  Wegen 99 Luftballons       99 Knights of the air  Ride super-high-tech jet fighters  Everyone's a superhero.  Everyone's a Captain Kirk.  With orders to identify.  To clarify and classify.  Scramble in the summer sky.  As 99 red balloons go by.         99 Jahre Krieg  Liessen keinen Platz fuer Sieger  Kriegsminister gibt es nicht mehr  Und auch keine Duesenflieger  Heute zieh ich meine Runden  Seh die Welt in Truemmern liegen  Hab' nen Luftballon gefunden  Denk' an Dich und lass' ihn fliegen       99 dreams I have had.  In every one a red balloon.  It's all over and I'm standing pretty.  In this dust that was a city.  If I could find a souvenier.  Just to prove the world was here.

A few princely states on the South Asia, notably in Punjab, have been ruled by a prince styled Sardar or Gujjar Sardar:  In Pakistan, many Pashtun, Baloch, Sindhi and Brahui tribal leaders are called Sardars.  Males of the Sikh faith in India are also sometimes called Sardar-ji, (similar to effendi in Turkish). Historically, Sardar was long used for important political, tribal, military and religious officiers including the families of the Sikh principalities.   Vallabhbhai Patel, the Indian freedom fighter and the first Deputy Prime Minister of Independent India was referred to as Sardar Patel, or "Sardar" for short; he is also known as 'Iron Man of India'.|`|b69eae1af2f0ccd6b0b7f4e575eee38caa	A variant spelling of sirdar: 1.A person of rank in India or Pakistan.  2.

It is just an easy, lazy tag that record labels and young kids use to label music so that it sells.  Stuff like punk, pop-punk, folk, indie, and new wave all get thrown into the "emo" catagory. EMo is short for emotional. Well, all music is emotional so it is a load of bull.   Put down your A.F.I , Fall Out Boy and Panic At The Disco Records and explore some music that is actually meaningful. Get online and research some music that is older than 5 yrs old.

Cable : If you often get transfer from one place to another, then each time you have to pay installation charges and other charges.  TS : One time investment.  3. C : Often fight with cablewala for bad transmission.  TS : Not any more.  4. C : Cheap but bad service.  TS : Costly(Rs.4000 all charges included) but worthy.  5. C : You can watch all channels.

Now cable usually has a local office and repair services.  Some people like dealing directly with a business and others don't mind waiting.    As for service via programming, hardware features and outages etc. it will depend on your location. Some places satellite is better and cheaper other places cable is.

51c139ae16cd9ac137753467ef177522aa	Bueno, si vives en EEUU y deseas escuchar la TV en radio (es brillante tu pregunta), primero necesitas conocer la frecuencia del canal en cuestin (VHF o UHF), hay unos aparatos parecidos a los que reciben "NOAA Weather radio" (de las alertas meteorolgicas) los que conozco eran de Radio Shack, pero creo que ellos ya nos los venden (los de recepcin de TV,  y an los llamam TV Sound que cubren del canal 2 al 13 -pero creo que este no es tu caso-), puedes preguntar en una tienda de equipos para el hogar y la otra opcin es un "scanner" genrico que es un aparato ms sofisticado, puedes pasar a una tienda de radio-aficionados (consultando tu necesidad) y buscar un modelo econmico que puedas ajustar al toma-corriente (para no comprar bateras).     En la web de radioshack.com encontr:  Que hay en los EEUU 3 bandas de audio para TV (VHF) y una cuarta en UHF (de momento no puedo confirmarlo ).    "Frequency Range Allocation:  VHF Television 54.0-72.0 MHz  VHF Television 76.0-88.0 MHz  Standard FM 88.0-108.0 MHz  VHF Television 174.0-216.0 MHz  UHF Television 470.0-805.75 MHz"    En verdad es ms simple de lo que parece, espero que veas ese canal  por TV (via se?al terrestre y no  por cable, porque si no es otra historia) no vivo en EEUU sino te dara ms detalles, en verdad espero te sirva.

0707ffd81ccff99c1c4ed83a329196b6aa	There is definitely a bit of an adjustment period when switching.    To help the unwanted string noises, turn the gain on your amp down a bit.....or, even better, play on the "clean" channel of your amp for a while.  Your "mistakes" will be amplified A LOT less.      The best way to keep in top shape for both acoustic and electric playing is to play both guitars on a regular basis.|`|7e97e613c5c091552cb5cfd562d19609aa	I went through the same thing.  I firmly believe acoustic and electric guitars are completely different instruments.  If you play clean electric guitar you pretty much have to play flawlessly, or every mistake is amplified.  I like to use distortion on electric, I have found that the louder and the more distortion you use, the less noticeable the mistakes.  I also had a hard time making the transition to standing up.  I never thought that would be a big deal, but I always played my acoustic sitting down and when I got my electric you have to play standing up.  Also, electric guitars are heavier and skinner than electrics, so it's a completely different feel when you play them.  The only other advice is practice practice practice with your electric.|`|AA11688753	Most definitely.  I have a beautiful SG that I got in 2000 that I have barely touched.  I can't let go of my old (as in 1989) Yamaha acoustic because there's something fuller and richer and more personal about acoustics.  Playing electric is so much easier on my fingers, though--it's easier to press down.|`|f3f03c88850756bd3e678fc50ea61259aa	i like the electric much better. if you are just playing through a strait amp it will sound like s*it. go get some effect pedals to bring out you sound. Truly i love them all check out my profile.

XLE3cikyaa	I think it was because she had a baby.  In season 4 where they incorporated her pregnancy she was only able to work 8 hour days (!) toward the end.  Apparently working on a one hour episode TV series can go for up to 12-14 hours a day!!!!  A bit much when you have a young baby!  A bit much full stop, I would have thought.  I don't know if there was any other reason though.  I agree it wasn't quite the same without her but I thought the addition of Spike was inspired.
61fcf832e5d4b87f1c941578ef4bacd3aa	Apparently she did say that.  Why would anyone call their child a blob?  Strange.|`|bf27501b1256e22041ea0cc5af31803baa	According to the magazines she did. But read the whole quote for context. She didn't just say my baby is a blob. She is quoted as saying:    "I think I feel so much more for Mad and Z because they're survivors, they came through so much. Shiloh seemed so privileged from the moment she was born. I have less inclination to feel for her... I met my other kids when they were six months old, they came with personality. A newborn really is this... yes, a blob! But now she's starting to have a personality... I'm conscious that I have to make sure I don't ignore her needs just because I think the others are more vulnerable."|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Yes she did but a very beautiful one.|`|6112fce921c5789ff47b05c280e49bffaa	No, I think you're mistaking Donald Trump talking about Rosie.|`|9dc1115713fd19c56e0dd02200e10ca6aa	as if she would i think she has a bit more respect for her kids..dnt believe evryfin u read..GO TEAM JOLIE|`|2d63e069c2e926fe79590ea741bd0fb6aa	she said that infant doesn't have much personally, until they get a little older.  it's not a comparison of a blob.  geeesh!  those star chaser are taking everything out of context just to get their ratings up.|`|03c8c67eb5cd8126621f29f80294733eaa	she's too classy to say something like that. never.

E agora se come?a a dizer que foi em Friulli Venezi Giulia, na Itlia. O local de nascimento do maior dolo do tango de todos os tempos, Carlos Gardel, continua a ser um mistrio. Uruguai e Fran?a sempre disputaram a sua nacionalidade. Os uruguaios dizem que ele foi batizado com o nome do pai, Carlos Escayola, e depois foi adotado pela francesa Berta Gardes, tirando da o nome Gardel. J os franceses afirmam que o cantor nasceu em Toulose com o nome de Charles Gardes. Agora entra em cena o pesquisador uruguaio Fernando Manzoni. Ele diz que encontrou no nordeste da Itlia cerca de 57 famlias com o sobrenome Gardel e que deve ser cogitada e estudada a possvel nacionalidade italiana do cantor.

Seu lugar de nascimento constitui uma quest?o controversa. Alguns sustentam que Gardel teria nascido no interior do Uruguai no departamente de Tacuaremb baseando-se em alguns documentos e matrias jornalsticas de poca. Outros dizem que Gardel teria nascido na cidade francesa de Toulouse como Charles Romuald Gards, filho de pai ignorado e de Berthe Gards (1865-1943). Gardel era esquivo sobre o tema e quando indagado dizia: "Nasci em Buenos Aires aos dois anos e meio de idade".    Cantor e ator celebrado em toda a Amrica Latina pela divulga??o do tango. Inicia-se como cantor ainda jovem, com o nome artstico de El Morocho, apresentando-se em cafs dos subrbios da capital argentina.

Diretores como Fernando Meirelles e Walter Salles conseguem fazer cinema de alta qualidade tcnica, com montagem sofisticada, e tramas interessantes sem sacrificar um certo teor srio nas narrativas: h sempre uma denncia escondida ou clara  pobreza, a injusti?a social. A minha nica crtica ao cinema nacional  a necessidade que muitos diretores tm de fazer cinema  situado no sert?o ou em favelas. Claro que n?o s?o todos os filmes, mas a maioria dos filmes brasileiros que s?o lan?ados no exterior, s?o filmes que confirmam o que j virou um esteretipo: que filmes brasileiros s?o ou exticos, no sert?o, ou violentos, na favela.

Embora saiba que a histria do nosso cinema  t?o antiga quanto de qualquer outro pas, nos anos dourados daquela poca  que apareceram as maiores revela??es do cinema nacional. Acho que a fase da pornochanchada marcou uma poca em que o cinema foi feito sem nenhum compromisso com nosso pblico, no entanto, bons filmes foram feitos com or?amento baixssimo. Mas a atual fase , sem dvida nenhuma, a melhor. Ela marca uma nova era de talentos e, acho que na verdade, em termos de expressividade e ousadia, "Cidade de Deus" foi realmente melhor. Mas em termos de produ??o, acho que nenhum outro foi como "Olga".                    Estamos formando novos cineastas e estes, trazem experincias de outras pocas e outros pases.

Principalmente os que tem um pouco de humor.  O Brasil tem muito talento, mas dizem que "santo de casa n?o faz milagre"..  Bom... Eu adorei e n?o me canso de ver...  O auto da compadecida;  Lisbela e o prisioneiro;  Se eu fosse voc;  Romeu e Julieta..  Tem outros mas esses s?o os melhores mesmo.  Com exce??o de se eu fosse voc, que  um pouco baseado no humor norte-americano, todos s?o brasileirssimos e divertidos.  Vale mesmo a pena ver.|`|1e314cc40cbf316a4bbc4ef1e87bbfbfaa	Vale a pena assistir sim.    claro que existem alguns que s?o uma porcaria. Mas, isso n?o acontece apenas com o nosso cinema. Acredito que o cinema brasileiro est crescendo e atraindo mais pblico.     Gostei muito do "quanto vale ou  por quilo?", com o ator Lzaro Ramos.|`|5235d5478c261707528ebf3d4909d423aa	O cinema nacional  realmente bom. Os filmes atuais s?o maravilhosos e, para mim, n?o est?o perdendo para os "hollywoodianos". Mas  sempre bom assistir a um antigo, Glauber Rocha fez filmes maravilhosos como "Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol", realmente muito bom e que todo mundo deveria assistir.

Foi de tudo um pouco: filsofo, mestre, lutador, ator. Foi o arco principal de liga??o entre as artes marciais, reservadas exclusivamente para os asiticos, e os povos do resto do mundo.     Filho de um ator da pera chinesa, Li Hoi Chuen, que estava numa turn pelos Estados Unidos, e tambm refugiado de Hong Kong pelo incio da 2a Guerra Mundial, com toda sua famlia, quando Bruce nasceu. Nasceu com o nome de Lee Jun Fan, mas foi apelidado por uma enfermeira de Bruce. No fim da turn, ele e toda a famlia, voltaram para Hong Kong, local onde Bruce cresceu. Bruce era um garoto pequeno, mas muito briguento, sempre "entrando em frias" com outros garotos e at mesmo com gangues de Hong Kong.     N?o foi nenhuma conspira??o. N?o, por incrvel que pare?a, foi apenas m reac??o a um comprimido que tomou...    Ele estava em casa da actriz com quem iria fazer o prximo filme, "Game of Death", quando sentiu uma grande d?r de cabe?a. Sua colega, e o produtor, que tambm l se encontrava, aconselharam-no a tomar um comprimido para as dores e deitar-se um pouco ali mesmo, antes de irem para as filmagens.      Nunca mais acordou!  Toda a gente achou estranho: Um actor, dolo para muitos, respirava sade, e agora...    N?o, ali havia gato, pensaram muitos cepticos. E outros, violentos. A actriz, Betty Ting Pey, foi de tal maneira acossada, que teve de fugir de Hong-Kong. Os f?ns de Bruce comiam-na viva.    Come?aram a bisbilhotar a sua vida particular, e desencantaram intrigas e mentiras! O seguro a pagar era de 5.000.000$00 de dlares. Chamaram o melhor autopsiador do mundo, com um palmars de cerca de 18.000 autpsias para a prova dos nove.    Esse ingls de quem n?o me lembro o nome, veio de urgncia da Inglaterra para Hong-Kong, executou a autpsia, confirmou tudo outra vez, e deu o seu veredito, que possibilitou a Linda Lee levantar o seguro milionrio: O comprimido das dores de cabe?a fez uma reac??o inesperada com medicamentos de um tratamento que ele andava a fazer, o que lhe provocou uma embolia cerebral.    Coisa que acontece 1 vez, em 1.000.000...

(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)  (Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)    Every day the sun comes up around her.  She can make the birds sing harmony.

Oh, no, they don't come better.  (To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)  She don't ask for things, no diamond rings.  (So together, like a hand in glove.)  Like pages in a letter.  (Ain't no woman like the one I love.)    She can fill me up when it's down I'm goin' (I'm goin').  Put a little music in my day.  Wouldn't be surprised if my love keeps growin' (it keeps growin').  Bigger every minute that she stays away.  I would kiss the ground she walks on,  'Cause it's my word, my word she'll obey, now.  Woo-ooh. (Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)  Well, I kiss the ground she walks on.  (To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)  She's a real good friend right to the end.  (So together like a hand in glove.)  A lonely man when she's gone.  (People, ain't no woman like the one I love.)    Oooh. What a good, good thing I've got.  She means to me a lot.    (Ain't no woman like the I've got.)  No, no, they don't come better.

Na ltima elei??o, fiquei frustrado por n?o ter em quem votar. Pra Presidente, nenhum deles mereceu meu voto. Pra Grovernador, quem tnhamos aqui em S?o Paulo? Deputado Federal? Estadual? Senador?  Para resumir:    Presidente:  desde a elei??o de 2002 o Lula n?o cumpriu promessas que sabamos que n?o cumpriria. O Geraldo  gastou dinheiro pintando helicpteros - qual a necessidade disso? Ser que na presidncia vai ser uma cpia do FHC?  Governador:o Serra renunciou, como confiar que ele n?o ir fazer de novo? Deputados: quais realmente ns conhecemos se eles s aparecem em falcatruas ou em poca de elei??o?

E mesmo a segunda msica que diz estar chovendo homens, eu n?o acho tambm que tenha liga??o porque mulher gosta  de homem e tem um trecho que diz:  ..."Deus aben??e a M?e Natureza  Ela  uma mulher solteira tambm..."  O que quer dizer que quem escreveu... escreveu para mulher,   mas os homossexuais gostam tambm....    Mas a minha opini?o eh que eles amam a Glria Gaynor e principalmente estas msicas porque s?o de um ritmo bem dancante e alegre...     I Will Survive - Glria Gaynor ( D.Fekaris/F.Perren )     At first I was afraid, Iwas petrified   Kept thinkin,I could never live without you by my side;   But then I spent so manynights   Thinkin,how you did me wrong   And i grew strong   And I learned how to get along   And so you,re back, from outta space   I just walked in to find you here with taht sad look upon your face   I should have changed that stupid lock   I should have made you leave your key   If I,d,ve know for just one second you,d be back to brother me     Go now go, wlak out the door   Just turn around now   Cause you,re not welcome anymore   Weren,t you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye   Think I,d crumble?   Think I,d lay down and die?   Oh no, not I. I,ll survive   Oh as long as I know how to love I know I,ll be alive   I,ve got all my life to live   I,ve got all my love to give and I,ll survive   I will survive hey hey     It took all the strength I had not to fall apart   Kept tryin,hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart   And I spent oh so many nights   Just feelin,sorry for myself. I used to cry   But now I hold my head up high   And you see me, somebody new   I,m not that chained up little person still in love with you   And so you feel like droppin,n in   And just expect me to be free   Now I,m savin all my love someone who,s lovin me.     Eu vou sobreviver     No incio eu tive medo, fiquei paralisada,   Continuava pensando que nunca conseguiria viver   sem voc ao meu lado.   Mas ent?o eu passei muitas noites   Pensando como voc me fez mal,   E eu me fortaleci   E eu aprendi como me arranjar...   E ent?o voc est de volta do espa?o exterior:   Eu acabei de entrar para te encontrar aqui   Com aquela aparncia triste no seu rosto.   Eu devia ter mudado aquela fechadura estpida,   Eu devia ter feito voc deixar sua chave   Se eu soubesse, apenas por um segundo,   Que voc voltaria para me incomodar...     V agora, saia pela porta.   Apenas vire-se agora,   (Porque) voc n?o  mais bem-vindo.   N?o foi voc quem tentou   Me magoar com o adeus?   Eu me desintegrei em peda?os?   Voc pensou que eu deitaria e morreria?   Oh n?o, eu n?o. Eu vou sobreviver...   Enquanto eu souber como amar,   Eu sei que permanecerei viva.   Eu tenho minha vida toda para viver,   Eu tenho meu amor todo para dar e   Eu vou sobreviver,   Eu vou sobreviver...     Foi preciso toda a for?a que eu tinha para n?o cair em peda?os,   Continuei tentando duramente remendar os fragmentos   do meu cora??o partido,   E eu passei muitas noites   Simplesmente sentindo pena de mim mesma.   Eu costumava chorar,   Mas agora eu mantenho minha cabe?a bem erguida.   E voc me veja [como] um novo algum,   N?o sou aquela pessoa insignificante, acorrentada   ainda apaixonada por voc...   E ent?o voc tem vontade de fazer uma visita   E simplesmente espera que eu esteja desimpedida...   Agora estou guardando todo meu amor   para algum que est me amando.   V agora...

a1701de876ebac5d63aad0679540fe83aa	In cinema and in literature, neorealism is a cultural movement that brings elements of true life in the stories it describes, rather than a world mainly existing in imagination only.    The movement was developed in Europe, primarily after the end of WWII, with Italian neorealist cinema a notable example. The movement is characterized by stories set amongst the poor and working class, filmed in long takes on location, frequently using non-professional actors for secondary and sometimes primary roles.     Italian neorealist films mostly contend with the difficult economical and moral conditions of postwar Italy, reflecting the changes in the Italian psyche and the conditions of everyday life: defeat, poverty, and desperation. Because Cinecitt (a complex of studios in Rome--the center of commercial filmmaking in Italy since 1936) was occupied by refugees, films were shot outdoors, amidst devastation.    Among the most well-known neorealism films are "The Bicycle Thief" and "Umberto D".|`|0d02345fb3990190de3b43a6a06df2d4aa	In cinema and in literature, neorealism is a cultural movement that brings elements of true life in the stories it describes, rather than a world mainly existing in imagination only.

On the other hand, hold that thought, because based on some rumors ~ it's also said that Shakira CANNOT bear children.

I say the only thing that seperates us from them is they are in the acting field and are self conceided. More people know their names. How about the actors on broadway? they are more decent and as a whole probably have less of an ego!|`|7a2701ac1e6ac2bd8a356dc823ae8ab8aa	because surely you live in USA or UK where celebrities are like gods and goddess, but in other European countries we don't pay much attention to that, we don't worship people who are like us, humans, we prefer to waste our time in more important things like pray to god (th rel god), work to gain money and go out with our family, play with our friends, study, etc, etc, you the Americans have create a vicious circle|`|5a0e4e0c27e48d43d86a4b2dcba991baaa	well yea.they're just like us regular people.their no different from us.

They aren't anything special, i don't follow them or even give a crap about them... but please, for the love of God, don't ever say: "we all deserve to be on TV"! It's bad enough as it is.|`|3e9107204262e3d3aa86a26a9a823735aa	Celebrities aren't different from us, except for their money, houses, jets, parties, attention and they have camera men on them constantly. Not all celebrities are like that. Many are humanitarians. Take Bette Middler, I (on the news) saw her right in there, in NYC, digging the dirt with non-celebrity people so a new playground could be built for the inner city kids. And she paid for the whole thing! What a caring person!|`|AA10755586	I don't.  These celebrities are far more attractive than the normal person, they are quite talented and they have to live with daily struggles that you never could.  They are different from every day people, and you can't deny these facts.    First of all, you aren't nearly as attrattive, or you'de be on T.V. or in the movies already.  They work hard at their appearance EVERY DAY, can you say the same?  Carmen Electra goes to the gym every day, Jennifer Aniston gets a new hairstyle every month.  Each of these celebrities sit in makeup chairs and at the hairdresser for hours a day... could you do that?  Could you be on a strict diet every day of your life?  Could you be hungry every day?  Could you have extensive plastic surgery?  Yes, it is painful and yes, it does take a lot of recovery time.    Secondly, yes... they have talent.  Have you ever cried at a movie?  Then you have been taken into a story only becuse the actors did a fine job.  Did you cry when you saw Titanic?  Thank Leonardo Dicaprio.  Did you cry when you saw An Affair To Remember?  Thank Cary Grant.  Did you cry when you say Brian's Song?  Thank James Cahn.  Philidelphia Story?  Thank Tom Hanks.    Dealing with the paparazzi is a talent in itself.  Could you really deal with someone in your face all the time and not react in a violent way?  Could you deal with everytime your heart is broken, it's splattered on the newspapers as if it's entertainment?  Really think about it.  When was the last time you had something go wrong?   Could you be Anna Nicole Smith looking at a picture of her son in his coffin in The Enquirer?    The long and short of it is there are many other ways celebrities are different than normal people.  I think the statements you make are more jealousy than anything.  I think that you probably didn't even read all this because you are so close-minded to the real world.  You need to stop being jealous and start watching celebrities and being interested in them and, above all, respecting them.|`|9e7f34ca42b0bc7a01f44825b1539e5eaa	i agree with you

96815f2ba96acf2b3402227642df5e70aa	Ha, it's about time somebody realized all this Hannah Montana nonsense was just a waste of time.  I've never been brainwashed by any of this nonsense that people think is so incredible.  If you ask me, this is just another imitation of a young  teen girl, bubblegum chewing pop princess who is used by companies for mainly marketing and bringing in money through various media.  Just look back at the late 90s when they had all these pop singers such as Britney Spears, Christina Agruliera, Mandy Moore, etc.  If you really think about it, most of them were the same.  Like I said before, it's only about getting the money.    Back to the question, I've seen a few episodes of her show and heard a few of her songs.  They all sound mediocre if you ask me.  She sounds like a teenage girl who is singing her favorite song at a slumber party.  You know why, because that's what exactly she is and Disney is trying to profit on what seems like a not so average, but appealing girl to female audiences.  It's going to be the same thing a couple of years from now, where Disney finds another teen and molds them into yet another market advertistment. ^_^'|`|7a9136821b6f155d08bccfbc048dbec9aa	i hate her.    shes a little to full of herself.    personally i think she cant sing.    she has a scratchy voice.    she cant act.    shes extremly upnoxious.|`|716209dc66a9f6e19afc97db4a33175caa	Could it possibly be because of her dad and his influence he has on her and the attention he is getting for her daughter  and the audience she is targeting to|`|37d227832fd06b1aafba5b918630d002aa	dude i know!!!im a little hooked too    the olley trolley lol|`|25395b8e96e9881761020dde74d3ed95aa	shut up, she rocks|`|73211431bfc5d82ad1b65eda95f3bf72aa	she is a wonderful actress and singer. please join my fanclub group if ur her fan http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/disneyc...|`|8751711e28db31f88cb81d405f5d9ed6aa	I Think the same thing.

Words & music by michelle tumes and tony miracle    Showers of sadness flood my soul  In the dryness of my pain  I watch for the rainbow  When my heart turns gray  As I long for yesterday  I know that I need you  In the time that I stray  So Ill follow like night after day    (chorus)  I need you to please pour down your light  For this is my life-line  I need you to rain down on me  The weather is fine when you rain on me  The weather is fine when you rain on me    The power of gladness takes control  When its streaming from your face  You vanish my sorrow  You wash it away  Like the sunlight in the rain  I know that I need you  In the time that I stray  So Ill follow like night after day    (repeat chorus)    Holy water falls as I lift my eyes  From my own fate  Then heaven flows straight through my  Spirit as it carries your embrace    (repeat chorus)    The weather is fine when you rain on me|`|491fbd2a5b7c406a49417f3ae3b8e00aaa	hillsong is great. look at: www.hillsong.com

Uma que adicionei recentemente na minha lista  a Grazielli Massafera, o que  aquilo gente? a mulher participou daquela porcaria de BBB e j est integrando o elenco de uma novela? pra mim ela nunca vai ser considerada uma atriz! fala srio! isso  um insulto  inteligncia dos telespectadores!. Ela  pssima e s porque  bonitinha est na TV. Onde  que a Televis?o Brasileira vai parar se continuar a colocar pessoas como Grazielli Massafera em novelas?.|`|d95bc878b416e78cecf1d7f60c9bdac9aa	Nossa s?o tantos que  mais fcil vc perguntar qual o artista que vc tira o chapu?

e70e42429c333fa029abdbcdae37f2a2aa	The song was covered by Nirvana, but it's actually a David Bowie song that was also a hit for Brit songstress Lulu.    The song is considered a play on the nursery rhyme The Psychoed, but may reflect Bowie's crossroads with his own identity, success, and rising star. Perfect for Kurt Cobain to cover.
889024a0d230a876607447f43d371b47aa	Ele j foi um timo humorista na poca dos "TRAPALH?ES",mas hoje deixa a desejar.Tudo na vida tem o seu tempo e o dele j passou.|`|546ed8c3c9bd925dacb0f8459262b369aa	Concordo plenamente, que chatice esse programa, mas ele deve ser um dos donos da globo  abra?o|`|18c09ff9db5eb4f2f30cae80483aec8faa	Apesar da audincia, eu n?o gosto nada de nenhum programa em que apare?a o Didi.|`|daa2f7875fd642ec04e7a7f09530bbe9aa	Ele tem que cal?ar as sandlias da humildade, vestir a carapu?a, ter mais humildade, n?o chega de clichs! Nada  t?o clich quanto o personagem c?mico(!) do Renato Arag?o. Na tv faz um bom tempo que ele  assim, o que ser que aconteceu com aquele  cara engra?ado dos filmes antigos dos trapalh?es, bem do comecinho, nos anos 70-80 quando ele era um cara sofrido, migrante tentando a sorte na cidade grande, sempre procurando uma sada para a pobreza, mas sobretudo ajudando os amigos, tratando-os de igual para igual??? Puft. Sumiu. No lugar dele nasceu esse sujeito marrento, fingindo ser um cara legal e da turma, fingindo a idade, fingindo que  humorista. Mrreu. A piada n?o tem gra?al, pelo contrrio, faz a gente ficar ainda mais triste. Ou pior: indiferente. O rei da comdia caiu do trono, puxou a descarga, acabou no esgoto da prpria mesmice.|`|89b8955b576bf61fe0bfd40c3577fa9aaa	Eu j viajei no ?nibus, indo para o trabalho, com pessoas que j trabalharam na casa dele (Barra da Tijuca _RJ) e os  comentrios, eram todos os piores possveis a respeito do "Dr. Renato", pois e assim que ele EXIGE ser tratado e ai, se algum chamar ele de Didi...Terrvel como a falta de humildade deteriora as pessoas...  Em rela??o ao ridculo malandro personagem, h muitos anos, pra mim, n?o tem mais valor algum, como todos j falaram aqui, tambm acho que ele j teve o tempo dele na TV..  Acho ate que tempo demais....  O pior, e que ainda tem gente, que paga pra ir ao cinema, levar os filhos para verem os filmes dele, dar dinheiro(como se ele j n?o tivesse demais...)pra ele, Xuxa, etc...|`|g5LJbpiCaa	Vc s esqueceu de um detalhe:  Todas as namoradas do Didi nos filmes e episdiso s?o mo?as bem mais jovens que ele e muitas vezes loiras.  Tem gente que n?o sabe a hora de aposentar mesmo, n?o sei mais quem v gra?a no programa do Didi. As crian?as hoje em dia nem sabem direito quem ele  pq n?o acompanharam o incio da carreira com os trapalh?es que alis, era mil vezes mais engra?ado. Sem contar que ele deve ser cheio da grana, pq os outros ficaram todos na misria.|`|96c491dd82ec22a4762cffd3efba53a3aa	A pena  que a toda poderosa Globo n?o ver que o tempo dele j passou. Opior s?o as arma??es que ele apronta com o pessoal muitas a sua equipe ri para n?o perder o emprego. Que coisa mais chata  ter um patr?o tipo renato arag?o. E os seus filmes s?o uma vergonha.|`|4e993c2afac5e65f3be352ec1976a239aa	Pro cara fazer humor tem que ter muito talento. Vi o Renato arag?o no Didi, estava no auge da carreira e com os outros integrantes dos trapalh?es formavam uma excelente equipe de trabalho. Infelizmente com a morte do Zacarias e do Mussum a equipe se desfez e o Didi n?o tem gra?a nenhuma mais, e ainda faz uns filmes de categoria -5 (menos cinco), sem contedo, p nem cabe?a, completamente toscos. J devia ter se aposentado faz tempo, vai ver ele  aquele tipo que n?o consegue ficar em casa sem fazer nada!!!! Est realmente decadente o Didi.
