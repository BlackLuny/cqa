I was in Iraq also, and I remember pulling security for a hell of a lot of things being built by the US and Iraqi engineers. Yeah, several instances the thing either went unmaintained because the Iraqi contractor would not maintain it, or it would get mortared to pieces soon after, but we built it none the less.<br>  <br>  One of the things that is taking so long is the lack of motivation from the people. They are nothing like Westerners. They do not stand up for what they believe in (except for the insurgents, go figure). They do not care to better they lifestyle the live, yet they want others to fix it for them. They sit by and watch, then complain when something isnt maintained. Its a long process and these people just make it longer.<br>  <br>  That being said, it is taking longer than I would have figured also. But we are not just rebuilding their structures (electricity, water, etc) we are also building their military and civilian law inforcement. <br>  <br>  Even if they want us to leave, we cant just leave them like this. It wouldnt be right. They were happy we brought down Sadam, they were happy when we first got there. But to leave them like this is setting them up to be in the same position they were in before we came, suppressed.

TsBSLY9taa	Sounds like the ones calling in death threats to Suleman are as unstable mentally as she is.<br>  <br>  I think many are upset with Suleman because she is very irereasonable as to her actions and the California tax payers are footing the bill.<br>  <br>  There really is no difference between Jon and Kate Gosselin choosing fertility treatment (against her doctor's advice) and Nadya Suleman in that both were in no financial situation whatsoever to afford additional children. Yet Kate Gosselin is put on a pedestal by Dr. Phil and others who will also vilify Nadya Suleman.  I think because now they are T.V. stars with a following of fans.<br>  <br>  The difference now is Jon & Kate  who both do not have jobs, live off the backs of their children who have made them multimillionaires.<br>  <br>   Looks like this is what Suleman may have been hoping for too?<br>  <br>  Jon & Kate Gosselin demean ,humiliate, belittle and act horrible to each other on camera  that it makes you wonder what they do off to each other off camera. <br>  And like Suleman lies the Gosselin's untruths about their story thank goodness are starting to come out.  <br>  <br>   Funny life has a way of doing that.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Proven fact....<br>  <br>  <br>  Children brought up in a home without a dad are more likely to commit crimes, be teenage parents, do drugs, not finish high school.....<br>  <br>  Those are the unarguable facts!|`|I8M5kw5Saa	Well I think that may be PART of the problem .But she had 6 kids that she couldn't take care of before the other 8 came along.And to hell with all of this crap about her being sick we all know she did what she did for the money.Yes I think she cares for these babies I mean who wouldn't they are so cute but she is still looking for the all mighty dollar.Look at it this way even if there was a father involved he would have to make major money to take care of this household and I would think that no man in his right mind would even want this situation and that is why I think she did it only for the money and the fame she is getting.I think the state needs to step in and put those children in homes with people that would love those kids a individuals not as a assembly line which is the way it would be if she tries to raise those kids by herself.They will grow up with serious issues trust me.|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	It does not have as much to do with her being single as much as it does that she has already made neglectful decisions with the children she has had already. <br>  <br>  If you are living with your parents in a 3 bedroom home that is on it's way into foreclosure with 6 children (two of whom are disabled), you spend the money that you have to support the children and keep a roof over their head.  Instead, she obviously used what money she did have to get invitro once more with all the leftover embryos.<br>  <br>  She is absolutely a neglectful mom.  The facts are the facts...and even after having 8 more kids, you would think a woman would not be able to afford to go shopping at Nordstroms for makeup and get your nails done while your pre-mature infants are still trying to become healthy and survive in the hospital.|`|f5821d0eb9486d7586aa71ba68cdecc8aa	I don't care much that she's a single mom.  I have a problem with the fact she already had 6 kids who are having to be supported by taxpayers and now she's gone and had 8 more.  If she were rich and could afford to take care of her little one woman village on her own, I'd have less problem with it, although I think it's unrealistic to expect one person can take care of 14 kids by herself.  It mainly bothers me that she's made bad decisions and the people are going to have to pay for them.|`|wyD1M4Buaa	She has a screw loose. It has nothing to do with her being single. Sexist.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	I don't care how many children a woman has as long as she can care for them emotionally and financially.  There are many two parent families with 1 kid who utterly fail as parents. Their are single mothers of 5 who do a wonderful job, and single dads, and grandparents.  The guy who said that kids without dad's end up in juvy and on drugs according to stats is full of crap.  I was raised by a single parent, as was my mother before me-sorry, no drugs or jail.  Wanna raise a good kid? Love, nurture and discipline them. Having mom and dad is great, but not a prerequisite to success and happiness.  The octomom is being unduly vilified, if the criticism stems from the notion that a woman without a man can't properly raise children.  That said, I don't see how she can support all these children without a huge trust fund-and I have a real problem with people having babies to get state support. That is a real issue, not single parenthood.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	No. She is being criticized for being an idiot. Why would someone with no job, living at home with her parents, not married and who already has 6 kids want to be implanted with 8 more embryos? It's because people know that she will end up on public assistance and the taxpayers will be paying for all of her kids. That is unless she gets rich making porno movies or something.
GDwMdfqjaa	I still remember the suicide attack in Saudi Arabia some years back. Radical muslims commited a suicide attack in which over 100 of their fellow Muslims were injured/killed and less than 10 Americans got killed.<br>  <br>  They celebrated that "victory".<br>  <br>  If Iran gets nuclear weapons, Israel will most likely get erased quite darn fast. Iran's theocratic government wouldn't care less about the civilians, just like their proxies - Hamas and Hezbollah don't, using them as human shields and not caring one bit about their safety. Just as it was shown with that suicide attack in Saudi Arabia - a killing ratio of 1:10 enemy vs. our own is a darn good ratio for them. So caring for the Palestinians who would get killed in Israel as well is out of the equation.<br>  <br>  So along with that and Iran's president repeatedly making statements regarding his desire to see Israel destroyed - He is quite likely to use the bomb at the first moment he can. Additionally, there's also the issue of not directly using a nuclear weapon but passing it down to the terrorist organizations it funds and let them do the job. Al-Qaeda or Hamas with a nuclear bomb - Now there's a nice picture for you of 1 minute to doomsday.<br>  <br>  In the bottom line - Israel won't allow the existance of a nuclear Iran. Israeli pilots have been training flying to greece and back, a distance similar to the one necessary to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities.<br>  <br>  Besides Israel, Europe is also worried as they're within the nuclear missile range. Ever since Obama took the most leftist and peaceful approach towards Iran among all countries who oppose the nuclear Iran, European countries like Britain, France and many others have suddenly begun to wake up and call for stricter sanctions against Iran - Which obviously won't work. When a radical extremist makes up his mind - It's final. Only the use of his own language, bringing down the iron fist, would deter him.<br>  <br>  As part of Israel's nuclear deterrent policy, Israel has a nuclear submarine. In the event that Israel gets destroyed and the prime minister and minister of defence are killed - There is an automatic order to nuke the country that nuked Israel. Additionally, if Israel is destroyed, the U.S. will definitely enter a war with Iran.. and this won't be a war with an objective, just "kick their ***", a much worse war than would be if the US chooses to attack Iran to stop their nuclear arming race.<br>  <br>  Bottom line - Either they stop developing nuclear capabilities or they'll be stopped. No other option exists. Oh, except one. But after that option is employed, you can just write a big red "ground zero" over the middle east.|`|xZwwb3kVaa	Well as long as they boil over into their own Countries, I could care less what they do. These people are past helping as they love wars , and whatever any one does they will just ignore it, and to say that they are religious is a misconception.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Israel will find a way to get everybody else involved.......|`|hwVeNGRmaa	Very easy to answer this. If the United States chooses to stay out of it and if it stayed as a conventional war, Iran will utterly annihilate Israel within 3 months to 8 months. If it were to go nuclear, both Countries will be destroyed, Israel completely and Iran almost completely, life changed as both countries know it, but Iran will be able to rebuild a nation about 1/7th of its current size and Israel will never be able to rebuild because the geographic size of it is too small and it will be a big hold next to the Mediterranean. However, I still believe the USA would help Israel out become of the Israeli influence in the Pentagon and in the Obama administration because Obama has more Israel descendants than any other President in the past in their administration and Rahm Emanuel is tied to the Mosad it is speculated. But there is your answer.|`|wyD1M4Buaa	Both are nuclear capable, and Iran will most likely be willing to get destroyed if it means killing all the Jewish kids.
DpfrtrNHaa	It was not real back then but its real now,<br>  <br>  Jewelers Asprey & Garrard were inspired to make a real Heart of the Ocean diamond necklace.. The result was a 170 carat (34 g) heart shaped sapphire with 65 diamonds, totaling 30 carats (6 g). Celine Dion wore it at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony as she sang Titanic's theme song "My Heart Will Go On." It was later sold at a benefit auction for $2.2 million, to Céline Dion's husband René Angélil.[1] The necklace now resides at the National Shipwreck Museum in Charlestown, Cornwall.<br>  <br>  Jeweler Harry Winston also created a "Heart of the Ocean" blue diamond necklace. The $20 million necklace was originally worn by Gloria Stuart.[1]|`|E28mQDX0aa	"The heart of the ocean" and the whole plot line of the movie involving Jack and Rose were completely made up by James Cameron.|`|ODDmWvn5aa	I don't think that part in the movie was real.

nhfaPN0Iaa	Cannot get in to see article.<br>  but i would guess that like their counterparts in the USA , the car industry in japan is also embattled and beset by problems, especially <br>  a huge downturn in profits and massive losses.<br>  Whilst the industry in japan is not experiencing the high costs of manufacture like the USA where the workers unions have achieved unsustainable benefits for its workers, the japanese have an entrenched system where certain workers are guaranteed jobs for life.<br>  With demand in the USA at the lowest level in decades, buyers are few and far between and even huge discounts are not encouraging sales.<br>  The USA market has shrunk and it has pulled down the other economies of the world with it.<br>  As the old saying goes, " when America sneezes, everyone in the world catches a cold"<br>  Aggravating the issue for the japanese car industry is the fact that domestically japan is also in an economic mess, the world's second largest economy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

The Seattle Post Intellegencer is in big trouble, the Detroit Free Press only prints 3X a week now and the San Francisco Chronicle will go out of business this year if a buyer is not found.<br>  <br>  Your question is a good one and news from the internet was taking a big chunk out of daily paper's business.  The sour economy America is going through, will be the final nail in many paper's coffins.<br>  <br>  I myself like reading newspapers as well as getting news from online, I think it will be sad if the majority of newspapers fold or go online only in the next ten years but that is the reality facing us.  I can understand that the cost of printing, using paper and delivering paper can't compete with the electronic internet for overhead so, it will be interesting to see which editions survive the first 25 years of this century.  <br>  <br>  With printed paper's demise, the profession of journalism will take a big hit.

8B1rROpUaa	Everyone talks about the wages, but wages actually have very little to do with whether a country is successful in exports or not.  If wages were important, then Africa and India would be very wealthy by now because they have much lower wages than China.  Clearly that isn't the case.<br>  <br>  China is successful for a few reasons.  But the biggest 2 are:<br>  1) Chinese government policies (eg, regarding trade and foreign investment: China had extremely attractive investment incentives for foreign companies in China.  Probably still has)<br>  2) Economy of scale, which most other countries cannot match.<br>  <br>  There are a few more, such as extremely stable government with very predictable stance on almost everything that doesn't change every 4 years.  But these 2 are probably the most important.|`|mEcJUfEqaa	Chinese labor is still cheaper, and China has all the industries needed to make any product.|`|F0ImwHlUaa	Look at the population between the two.

They have to do something with all that U.S. money.   <br>  <br>  If the Chinese are buying as much stuff as we do, they would just move that U.S. money around the world.  But the Chinese economy is not as big as ours, so they don't need to buy as much as we do.<br>  <br>  So, they invest their extra money.   The easiest place to invest is in U.S. Treasuries that pay interest.    Since this is a scary world with the economies falling apart, everyone knows that investing in the U.S. Government backed Treasuries is the safest investment there is.<br>  <br>  Therefore --- The Chinese will not say no.

K5IOSGXAaa	Everyone who owns/sets up a company works very hard. Some are successful, some not. It's just time for the wealthy to pay a more fair share of taxes. That's all. The middle class has carried the rich and the poor on their backs for too long in this country. Now the middle class is in danger of disappearing. Some one has to take over the burden.

ytQfxuPyaa	Yes it is. Bush said he was guided by god, and look at the mess he caused. The US, despite denying, makes sure the president is always a devout christian. There is no separation of church and state in the US. <br>  Leaders should be able to make rational decisions, without being affected, as they are, by whatever religious doctrines they subscribe to.|`|30a4ee65246d549232fafd90921ce359aa	Yes, a very dangerous thing I think.<br>  <br>  Having a religious leader who can make the political decisions leads to a type of anarchy - witness Iran where the ayatollah and the religious council can bar certain people from running for political positions.  Suppose Iran has nuclear weapons: it would not be a good situation to have the ayatollah wake up one day and direct they be used on Israel with his reasoning being "God Told Me To".   Not a good situation.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	Yes, it is.  Religion causes more wars than anythingelse and religious leaders can often be fanatics.  In my humble opinion, mixing the two is a recipe for disaster.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Yes it is.......<br>  <br>  That is why we have "Separation of Church and State" here in the USA......|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Anyone who can "rationalize" an action with an impossible to debate statement (like God told me to do it) is very dangerous.  This can be any sort of unverifiable statement unrelated to religion also (like either you are with us or against us).|`|O71xlcG3aa	only when you have extremist who are unwilling to compromise and be accepting and tolerant of other peoples beliefs|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Separation of Church and state does not officially happen in the UK - the monarch is the head of Parliament and the Anglican church, and Anglican bishops get to sit in the House of Lords (the upper house of Parliament)<br>  <br>  That said, the UK is in effect a secular state. If any politician mentioned God too much, he should expect a spectacular electoral defeat.

lvdao6r5aa	barack obama is certainly not spending money on the democrats, as some will say. the idea that by supplying the poor with money, the economy will prosper is insane, though. there is a reason the poor have so little money. they can't handle money. <br>  <br>  and furthermore, the government shouldn't be helping the country out. it shouldn't be obama that helps the economy. it should be entire left up to the capitalist system. the nearly suffocated capitalist system.<br>  <br>  the plan will fail, and to explain why in more detail would take me about 2 hours so why even try? some people will never understand.|`|3o805Q2Aaa	i ain't saying its a totally bad idea, we need more money in the economy that's a fact but if we keep printing money the value of our dollar will keep going down countering the effect of the stimulus package, and like i said we need money in our economy but if anyone remembers when bush was in office they approved a 700 billion stimulus package and now we approved another 789 billion stimulus for obama so in less than a year we have almost a trillion and a half of "borrowed money" coming into our economy and drawing interest for the chinese economy, so what im trying to say is how are we ever going to stimulate our economy borrowing money.|`|wyD1M4Buaa	He's definitely stimulating someone's economy. The rich democrats no doubt. <br>  <br>  Here's to hoping at least a little of the almost trillion dollars he's using is going to trickle down to the America people. <br>  <br>  That's about as likely as winning the lottery though (only, with a crappy payout).|`|d01EV6npaa	love it<br>  succeed.<br>  barrack is exactly what we need in this economically weak time. i believe he can handle the pressure and will lead our country well.|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	I dont know, but I think when the Bush Administration went out approving the stimulus for wallstreet, it screwed a lot of americans over.  <br>  <br>  To see today on the news that a company was having a party hiring Sheryl Crow to attend and other celebs, and their answer to the extravagance was that "We didnt even need the money, but were pressured to take it".  That is absolute bullshit, and in a way I almost think it was done on purpose to give all the "good ole boys" a last ride while knowing Obama would be in charge of it all to fix it and get most of the blame.|`|PDF2NUZKaa	Too much insane and needless spending and not enough tax breaks. Look at some of the pork projects and you get the idea. It seems like the Democrats are paying themselves off for all they've missed the last eight years. But I don't blame Obama as much as Pelosi, the absolute worst Speaker that Congress has ever had. She's more the architect of this "stimulus" than the Prez. It's a shame. Reagan had worse inflation, higher unemployment and he cut taxes and let the sconomy right itself, which it did. The Dems are following a path that guarantees losing seats in the next few elections, especially if this plan bombs.|`|9e7711c6889e00f436943d818ddbe9a1aa	I think it's a good idea. We've seen the government give people money last year in hopes of putting it back into the economy. That didn't work. I know I got my $1200 and paid off a credit card bill. The bailout didn't work as we've seen the companies did nothing but give out big bonuses and buy crap they didn't need. Obama mentioned about raising taxes on the wealthy and the Republican's are doing everything they can to fight him on this. What else is Obama to do? The country will not fix itself so if we don't pump money back into key areas of the economy then things will get worse.|`|351ab1780b64a03e2d34f1ccbbbdd38caa	Unfortunately, I think he feels too strongly that he is this country's savior.<br>  I'm glad he's all for "fixing" things but I don't agree with all of his plans and the way he thinks everything will turn out fine only if things go according to his plan.|`|cp7regataa	my hours have been reduced for over a year so I am excited about my 13 dollars

I agree with your first answerer.  America is a freedom loving country and we strongly oppose terrorism.  This is not a new concept to Bush Presidency, as Reagan also was tough on terrorism. He made this speech right after he attacked Qaddafi in Libya.<br>  <br>  "I warn that there should be no place on earth where terrorists can rest and train and practice their deadly skills. I meant it. I said that we would act with others if possible and alone if necessary to ensure that terrorists have no sanctuary anywhere. Tonight, we have. Thank you and G-d Bless you."<br>  Reagan on Terrorism<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo7HkVyJJ5s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo7HkVyJJ...</a><br>  <br>  American allies in the free West also gain benefit from the Afghan war.  The name of the Afghanistan war is called ENDURING FREEDOM and we do have allies in the Operation. We need more troops though and I hope our allies won't dodge the issue and will join with America to send more troops.<br>  <br>  Operation Enduring Freedom<br>  <a href="http://icasualties.org/oef/" rel="nofollow">http://icasualties.org/oef/</a><br>  <br>  Dodge Afghanistan Troop Issue<br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090207/ap_on_re_eu/eu_germany_security_conference">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090207/ap_o...</a><br>  <br>  Besides Western benefit, there is also benefit to Pakistan and India.  Afghanistan was a hostile entity and a threat to the moderate Pakistani gov't. Pakistan has a large amount of extremists amongst its populace, and Pakistan is a nuclear power.  It is necessary to maintain the status quo and keep Pakistan stable and not vulnerable to a hostile take over from the neighbor next door.  Also, India gets benefit because Islamic extremists are a threat to India so any neutralization of extremists is a plus to the region. <br>  <br>  Long term benefits show that these benefits are sustainable. Qaddafi over in Libya was virtually emasculated, made effeminate and weak and almost neutralized. On the following Qaddafi clip, he talks about quite a few things, his speech is very telling. He talks about the Arab-Israeli wars and the Iraq war and that the Arabs should just handle things in international court from now on. He speaks to the whole Arab Summit that Israel was right and that if Israel sues then Israel would win, of his fear that America will hang them all like we hung Saddam. LOL  (It's not that we want to because we actually have moderate allies in Mid East, but it's a great lesson to the possible extremist governments in the Mid East.)

689c455122b340827462328d4ec387d5aa	Personally I think we need to spend a huge amount of money on researching Nuclear. I don't mean nuclear as we know it. The nuclear power we currently use is Nuclear fission, which is taking a big atom and splitting it up producing lots of energy and waste.<br>  <br>  I think research on Nuclear fusion is the answer, which is taking small atoms and making a bigger atom. The likely reaction would be combining hydrogen to make helium which happens in the sun. As we have a constant supply of hydrogen from the sun this is renewable, incredibly powerful and only produces helium which is a completely harmless gas.<br>  <br>  Things like wind power aint a good idea. Here is a fact, you need 40,000 wind turbines to produce the same power as 1 nuclear power station.
i7oHTo9haa	Hi. I'm out of area now, a California native, and Danville is close to my home town, but the same thing has happened over here recently where I currently live, Mississippi.<br>  <br>  It's not uncommon during training to do those things.  We're currently sending more troops over to Afghanistan so maybe that is why.  There's still a base over towards Sacramento so they aren't too far from you to do a military exercise.  It's cool, they are "friendlies" it actually makes me feel safer to know they're around.<br>  <br>  United States Military Tribute Video<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p9j-vEW3E0&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p9j-vEW3...</a>

Whomever took her knew the father was working at night and bold enough to enter the home while other people were sleeping in the same room. I think it is someone who knows them and lives in the area.

ezP95Lq6aa	It means you are a citizen who is allowed to hold an American passport.<br>  <br>  The experience of being an American changes depending where you grew up (the south, midwest or east coast for example) due to the cultural differences between the regions. It also changes if you grew up in the US or immigrated.<br>  <br>  Generic answer might be "values personal freedom, freedom of the press, democracy, you can be anything you want if you try hard enough, etc"|`|6eXRX4jpaa	it means you can be your own person without being judged and having many different cultures in on place and accepting them.|`|QeMiIL15aa	It means you are an American citizen born in america|`|tod8jy9Paa	As a Brit I find Americans a strange race. They are generous to the stage where its plain stupidity. Although are are in deep recession and many Americans are suffering financial problems, unable to pay mortgages, health bills and millions out of work their government still are able to give huge amounts of cash aid to parts of the world. Example they give Israel $3 billion a year most of which is spent on arms and munitions and yet when Israel bomb Gaza to the ground with those very bombs then say they will give $900 million to help rebuild it.

AA10370987	How incredibly sad.  This is my first time hearing of this...she is a very sick person (no doubt a victim of abuse herself).  Not to sound insensitive, but I've come to believe the most self-destructive people (killing your own kids??!!) are not meant to pass on their genes.  Maybe in a few tens of thousands of years, all of our sick, violent and destructive behavior will have been bred out.  (wishful thinking?)|`|92iuiuZKaa	No I haven't heard of it until now. Thats really sad :*(|`|tguEmxVyaa	I think a time out would have been better..|`|qkWmI8W9aa	i feel really bad for the poor kid..he was an innocent child and did not deserve such a horrible death.

1o3OqSioaa	The true cost is in the blood shed by our brave and selfless soldiers, and their families that sacrifice so much for our liberty. The price that they pay with their blood can not be measured, and should never be kept secret. If the cost of war is kept secret, then those of us who sit here in the United States of America as free people, due to our armed forces, will grow complacent and keep complaining about the monetary cost of war, thinking that we are actually making a viable contribution. When in fact, we just sit here and wait for someone else to die to keep us free, and take it for granted that somehow it is our birthright. <br>  I want to personally thank all of the soldiers who have fought and died for the freedom that we all enjoy and take for granted. <br>  Lizzie|`|AA12330998	we should all have to watch the truth about war and all aspects if it's surreal realities. let people see where their tax dollars are going, who lost who and yes, what costs are involved ... - there really isn't anything 'nice' about war. hell yeah, show it all. <br>  <br>  might make people stop invading each other's homeland.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	republicans dont want to know the cost of war...thats why they never included it in the budget|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics ' Knowing me knowing you"<br>  "Ring my bell"<br>  The cash register that keep on ringing?<br>  In signing the credit cards?<br>  For cash advances?<br>  How much do we need?<br>  For long term investment with high returns?<br>  Bankers sure loves it.<br>  Good for businesses.<br>  When the monthly statement start to roll in time.<br>  "Children are to be seen and not to be heard"<br>  Luke 6.30-40,41-45,46-49<br>  What do you think?|`|klOP21xTaa	Freedom of the press and all, but i think the family should have the final say.

mEcJUfEqaa	Frankly, Obama was willing to say anything to get elected.<br>  <br>  He said he would close Gitmo, now he says he'll close it in a year.<br>  <br>  He said he didn't support the surge, now he wants a surge in Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  He was going to pull the troops out of Iraq immediately, now we have no idea when he will pull them out.<br>  <br>  He said he wouldn't raise taxes on the middle class, now he is.<br>  <br>  He was against running up the debt, he's running it up faster than ever before.<br>  <br>  He was against the Patriot Act, now it's OK.<br>  <br>  Obama is a lying opportunists.  What did you expect?|`|wyD1M4Buaa	No one is getting drafted.<br>  <br>  It's pretty obvious Obama's promises are hollow and unrealistic.

Come on seriously, the man has been in office for less than two months and people are expecting him to solve all of the last 8 years in that amount of time?<br>  <br>  Where were all these people the last 8 years demanding that the president we had at the time, fix the inevitible crisis?  I dont get it.<br>  <br>  Maybe, just maybe....everyone complaining about what Obama is doing, can voice their opinion by letting him know that what John McCain and Sarah Palin had planned for the economy when they were running, would help right now asap.  Obviously, they had a great sure fire plan, to deal with the crisis, didnt they?  <br>  <br>  Let Obama know that you want him to consider the plans that would have made the country whole again if McCain were elected instead of Obama.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	People aren't getting drafted. We have a volunteer military. where do you get your information?<br>  <br>  Obama made several promises about our troops before he was elected. Before he was actually commander in chief. Before he got security briefings and terror reports from our inside spys. it's a whole new ballgame he is playing now. he actually has to think about what he should do instead of saying what he thinks people want to hear.<br>  <br>  God help us.

There are plenty of other extremists to kill that are in Afghanistan.  We do an occasional "stepping on the toes" minimally over into Pakistani airspace by drone to target any extremists that are found to be retreated there when it is necessary.
