20090205154852AA8aLTQ	Health;Women's Health	Can I Be Honest With Planned Parenthood About My Need for Birth Control Pills?	I have health insurance and see my Ob/Gyn for annual gyno exams. I suffer from Endometriosis and take continuous BCP to suppress menstruation. I am not sexually active. The problem is that my health insurance does not cover my pills. They have a strict policy that they never cover them....even for women like me that are not sexually active and take them for legit medical conditions. They only cover them if the woman has a laparascopy. I don't want to have one.      Anyways, I heard that Planned Parenthood can give out free birth control pills. However, will they be angry if they know that I'm using it to treat my Endo? Or do they really not care? Should I pretend to be sexually active?      I realize that the gov'ts point in giving out free pills is to reduce the kids on welfare....so obviously they won't have any interest in my Endo since I am not at risk for having children .

20090203013214AA0eK2W	Health;Mental Health	Is It Heart Break, Depression or The Fact I Am Growing Up?	In the last two years I graduated from college, and got my heart broken. I graduated from college after dealing with struggling all four years with my grades and an eating disorder stemming from when I was a fat kid. I got my heart broken senior year of college, I dropped a ton of weight and cried. My heart literally ached for a year after that. No one knows about that.      I joke  to many and say that my soul has been ripped from me but I am serious. I now have a dim view on society and my nation after going through my college years. I always wanted to be a cop and help people I no longer want to do that. I no longer believe in the idea of being a good person.      Since that stuff has happened to me I actually have become more social and fun to hang out with and I have made a ton of friends. I am doing more things like sports and stuff. I am more active period. People are amazed I wasn't athletic in school and now I run many miles a day, box, do martial arts, shoot guns etc etc. I excel at these things too.      On the other hand I have problems sleeping, I seem to be an adrenaline junky doing crazy things that have come close to getting me killed, I am no longer serious, I can't concentrate on things, I have a horrible memory and no direction in life. I wouldn't say that I am suicidal but I sometimes feel my life has a purpose and my actions reflect this.  I don't want to go any further than living in my home town and hanging out with friends and working at my family business even though I have an advanced degree from a good school.

20090203013408AA5Xhta	Health;Men's Health	Why are some people naturally predisposed to having stronger not larger muscles than others?	I think I was born with naturally stronger muscles than other kids because I would be able to wrestle multiple kids my size and win and later when I worked out with kids and their muscles always seemed bigger and more defined than mine but I could lift more weight than them.(im not a fat guy though I used to be slightly chubby but now im pretty defined but not with big muscles so im kinda skinny) You know how powerlifters are usually not huge guys(most of them are fat but if you took away the fat their not that huge) but their muscles can lift really heavy weights thats what mine are like. I find it good because Im always stronger than people expect but bad because I dont have larger muscles to match my strength which makes me feel aesthetically  inadequate to the average person of close to the same strength as mine. Im wondering if its genetic though I wouldnt say thats the case since im half european half native but people say i look more spanish. But those 2 races dont have that quality from my knowledge so im stumped.

I'm currently 17, and I don't see any reason why I would need to get that done. I eat only healthy food, so no sugar rich artificial flavor filled foods that cause cavities, I drink only water when I'm out, so I don't get my tooth enamel eroded from drinks like coke and pepsi, I always brush my teeth pretty much right after I eat, I floss, and I use mouthwash daily! I've only had one cavity in my entire life, and that was because for some reason people brought in more candy that we had in class, but that never happens anymore. My dentist wants me to go to this oral surgeon with whom he has like some partnership thing. I don't believe everything he says, because you can't always trust doctors can you? Like eye doctors always say that like everyone needs glasses when glasses actually hurt your eyes more, which they consistently deny. I think that my doctor wants me to get my teeth removed only because my insurance co. pays him! I honestly think that if there was sociolized health care, with the gov. paying him, he wouldn't want me to get my teeth pulled unless there obviously was a problem with them, which there isin't! Am I right about this? His nurse also mentioned that technically you could "get your wisdom teeth removed any time between now and 30." What was that all about?

20090205121849AA5JkCK	Health;Women's Health	Thinking about getting the coil?	I've been on the contraceptive pill for 2yrs (was Microgynon and then Loestrin 30), however I have noticed that my mood is constantly up and down and feel that maybe the pill is partly to blame for this.      I used to get Depo-Provera injections and it did not agree with me at all..I bled the full time I was on it and eventually had to be given a prescription to stop the bleeding. I know that Depo and the Implant are similar so I assume that is out of the question.      The only option that seems reasonable to me at the moment is the coil as it is a non-hormonal contraceptive.      I just wanted to know of some people's experiences with it? Did you find it as effective as hormonal contraceptives? Did you have any problems with it? Also, I am only 21, so does anyone know if I would even be considered for the coil?      Many thanks in advance for your help.

I am wondering if anyone can help me out here, because my doctor here in France is an utter moron + can’t give me an answer. So I’d like to hear from anyone who’s gone through the same/similar.   I am on the pill (Adepal) + have taken two packs consecutively (throughout my teenage years I did this many times with no consequences), but I missed one of the pills.   I started bleeding on the Monday + had really bad cramps. On the Saturday I had excruciating cramps + went to the toilet. But before I sat down, a massive clump of mucus fell out of me along with a load of blood. I sat down on the toilet + when I took my Tampax out, a flesh coloured sac came out along with more blood. On the Monday I went to the doctors (very unhelpful) + then went to the clinic for a blood test. Yesterday I got the results back proving negative for pregnancy, which ruled out a miscarriage. But the doctor can’t give me an explanation as to what it was. Before it all happened I’d had sore breasts for about three weeks + also constant heartburn (which I had throughout my pregnancy with my now 6 year old son) + felt as though I was pregnant. I’ve been taking Exacyl ampules to stop the bleeding, but they’ve made me bleed more.   My fiancé + myself have been very upset thinking that it’s a miscarriage + we want to know what it was which the medical ‘profession’ isn’t telling us. If anyone can shed any light I’d be most grateful. Thank you.

20090205123840AAGRdWX	Health;Diet & Fitness	Does anyone else have this kind of problem?	I am obsessed with my weight. I look at all the other girls at school, analyzing there bodies wishing i could just put them on a scale and see if they weight less/more than me. I was never like this before this year. It's a problem and I dont know what to do about it. Since this past school year began, I've been watching what i weight SO carefully. Back in 9th grade, I wouldn't even care what I put in my mouth. I ate TONS, and it didnt even phase me. I weighed about 125-128 in 9th grade. 10th grade, I was a little more cautious, but still eating a lot sometimes...I looked at other girls but didn't analyze it so much. I weighed at about 120-125. This year (11th grade) I have become completely obsessed. I watch every little thing I eat. I try to work out but I become so lazy. I look at every girl i see. And wish I could put them on a scale. I look at my stomach every day and look at every single little roll. I am so obsessed. I try not to eat alot and a lot of the days I eat about 1300 calories when 2 years ago i would eat like 2000 calories a day. Right now my weight is going on and off between 117-123. I am so obsessed, i dont know what to do...

Sometimes it goes with a headache and I keep sweating even if I'm not hot.  The pain in the abdomen is most unbearable!  It's so severe that I can't do anything- can't study, can't go out, can't sleep.  It lasts for a couple of hours.  I have to take a painkiller but most of the time it doesn't help much.  And sometimes I vomit, just to make things worse.  After a good night's sleep the pain goes away, but simply sleeping is difficult too.      I'm only 16 and this occurs every time my period comes, but only on the first day.  My mom and my maternal aunts used to have this problem too, but my mom says things got easier for her after giving birth.  What can I do to get rid of such symptons?  Thanks!

20090203203549AAT86Ex	Health;Dental	Please help! what is happening to my tooth!!!?	I've had a cavity in one of ,my molars for a while now and I knew this.  It's a rather large, visible hole in the tooth and when it became this, I found that I could no longer eat on that side of the mouth or I would be in pain.  BUT, that is the ONLY pain I have ever felt since this happened.  As time went on, I discovered that food would get stuck in the hole and cause rot so to remove these, I started using the items known as  'brush picks" to go into the hole and remove the food particles.  This was working well for a while.  Now for about the past two weeks, food doesn't get stuck in there anymore, but something else does.  It's this strange, white-ish colored small mass that i've removed once with the brush pick, thinking it was some type of food particle and removing it caused me alot of bleeding and it was also hard to remove, as if it were stuck inside of my tooth or something.  Two days later, I noticed it has come back again and I have not touched it.      I know this may sound vain but I really wanted to wait until I get my tax return (end of Feb. early March) to get the tooth filled, seeing as I don't have dental insurance right now, but it is starting to scare me and it costs 95 bucks to even have just a consultation with my dentist.  I thought it might be an abscess, but i've looked up literature and pictures of those on several sites and the text and pictures just don't match up to what i'm experiencing.           Anyone know what this could be??  Any help at all would be appreciated, thanks.

So he put on the temporary crown and a week later while i was chewing gum the whole thing came out... is that normal for a temp crown to come out? so i have to go back and get it glued back on. then today when i went to get the permanent crown put on it didn't even fit right. it was too big and when he tried to put it in it would just fall right out. i almost choked on it! so he has to now take More impressions, send them back to the lab and have another crown made?? it just seems like alot of hassle, is this normal? should i switch dentists? if he took an impression the first time and sent it to the lab why wouldn't it fit right? did he mess up? now i have to start all over again.

Now all girls that i work with keep putting me down. They are the size i used to be. Every time i say no to bad food i get accused of starving myself. I don't deprive myself at all. I stick to a strict diet and make sure i have all the proper nutrition. Just because i don't eat donuts and fast food anymore doesn't mean that i'm starving. I'm at a healthy weight. I don't flaunt it or anything. I'm the same person on the inside. It really hurts my feelings that people who i thought were my friends all the sudden have turned on me. Are they just jealous of me? I think these comments are rude. I would never call them fat or tell them that they are eating too much because it's offensive. But isn't it just as rude as what they are saying to me?

Now I've learned everything there is to know about nutrition and dieting, but there's just this one thing i can't figure out. Can I lose weight TOO fast, even if it's done the completely healthy way?      I've done 9.8 pounds in 5 days. My whole family is telling me that it's bad for me.      Now, my diet before this was probably pushing 4,000-4500 calories a day of food, and maybe even more because i drank about 8 cans of soda. My BMR is 2359.144. Previously i was lightly active at work doing 20 hour weeks, but this week i went full time. My new diet has been 2,500 calories a day with a lightly active lifestyle, and all water. My exercise is playing ITG2 for a few hour spans, i'm estimating about 700-1200 calories an hour depending on how many other people are there (no joke, that's how i've done this much weight eating healthily).      So...if i continue at this rate, is it safe for me?

20090205123520AAsnBCq	Health;Other - Health	Moments of unconsciousness?	For the past couple of months, I've been having little, minuscule 2 second long faints. My eyesight gets blurry and I sort of start to fall over, but then I gain consciousness again. After these little episodes, I feel perfectly fine.     But today, as I was listening to music, it happened a little bit differently. I felt the usual wooziness, and my eyesight blurred, but then this high pitched fuzzy sound kept getting louder and louder until I could no longer hear the music I was playing. I could hear anything at all except for the high-pitched sound in my head. This black-out one lasted longer than the others, the while length of  "Love Story" by Taylor Swift. I sort of shuffled myself onto my bed in the middle of this somehow, because I though it'd be best if I laid down. Slowly I felt more stable, and the high pitched noise died down.     I had never told anyone of this until today.     It's been a half hour since this happened, and I still feel a little bit shaky. Any ideas on why this is happening to me, and how I can make it stop?    P.S. I don't take any medications or drink cough medicine by the bottle or anything. I've never had any serious health problems.

20090205134023AAMTPNU	Health;Diet & Fitness	I'm feeling hungry all the time?	Recently, I've been hungry for what seems like all the time. I'm eighteen, in college, 5'5", and not over or underweight. In fact, I'm almost perfectly in the middle at 120. For the last two weeks, I've wanted to do nothing but eat and my stomach is always growling. I've not been exercising more than usual, nor have I been stressed. I'm on my period now (which seems to be making it worse) and there isn't any way that I could be pregnant (unless, you know, immaculate conception or whatever, but I think the whole period thing kind of kills that theory). I also eat very well -- years of figure skating taught me how to have a balanced, calorie-satisfying diet. I actually had to do a nutrition project for a class recently and my prof thought I had to be lying, with how perfectly on target all my stats were.      What's up? Could I be growing again? I'm about the same height as my mother, but my father is REALLY tall. But, at the same time, every female that I know if in my family has stopped growing around sixteen, and my doctors figured I was done around then. Or could it be something else?       I'm just tired of wanting to eat all the time ): I'm not generally a really big snacker and I'm hypoglycemic, so this is playing havoc with my life trying to keep myself satisfied and keep my sugar somewhere that is reasonable.        Any ideas about what's going on and what I can do to fix it?

I know that she isn't bulimic or anything because we have spanish class together after lunch and she doesn't like go to the bathroom in that time or anything. I know that some people can have good metabolisms but this is just crazy. Is there something more going on here? Like a medical thing?

This month has been really bad where I actually vomited on two separate occasions. The nausea is the most prominent problem and it happens about everyday. My sleeping habits have been the same for about 5 years. Recently, I went on vacation to Republica Domincana and I was absolutely exhausted all I wanted to do was sleep! I urinate frequently, move my bowels about 3-4 times a day, and get roughly 6-8 hrs of sleep a night. Could I be diabetic? Or should I start taking more iron?

20090203031926AAtiO9m	Health;Other - Health	Those with piercings/piercing problems: are you aware of this?	I've answered a whole lot of questions about piercings lately, in relation to them hurting, irritating, swelling, etc. Piercings are fantastic, beautiful expressions of your personality, but I just want to ask if people are aware of the following:      1. The best and only necessary way to care for almost any piercing is to boil a cup of water, allow it to cool to luke warm, throw in 2-3 pinches of salt (more salt will just burn, not heal) and soak the area in this saline once or twice daily for 2-3 weeks.      2. If you are unlucky enough to get an infection, LEAVE THE JEWELRY IN. Seriously, every time someone asks a question about this, somebody else says "Dude, OMG, take it out, wash it with alcohol, OMG, WTF". These are the two WORST things you can do. Alcohol will burn healing tissue, and if you take out the piece, the skin will close over the infection and form an abcess. Huge, ugly, smelly and dangerous = abcess.       So, yeah, I'm asking if you know this? And will you please answer any future piercing infection questions in this way? Share any other tips you might have in your answers. Kthxbai.

I usually eat healthy, make my own food, dont eat out often, dont like sweets or fat, etc...   So I decided to exercise more and keep my eating habits.    I run 2 miles on the treadmill (around 30min) and do some abs Mon-Thr mornings before work. Its been almost 2 months (only missing christmas week) and I havent lose almost any weight. When I workout I drink 1lt of water and I added drinking a yogurth before workout.    The only thing I've noticed is that Im hungry more. I snack edamame or baby carrots.

I was doing really well with my diabetes, then hormones kicked in for my once-monthly gift, and the next week I developed a cold thanks to my roommates.   For two weeks I've been having high, high numbers. I saw my doctor last week and she said that it's normal for that one week a month, but now that I have a cold too it's really frustrating because I feel awful.   Does anyone else know what to do when you get a cold? I don't know if these 200-400s are due to the medicine (I'm taking Mucinex D and some acetaminophen) or just having a cold. For example, I was 350 earlier today and took 9 units on my pump and it only went down to 320 in an hour and a half.   Any advice or stories (so I don't feel all alone, haha)??

Ok here it is.      1. People are saying if you "fast" you lose weight. I have heard that it works because you aren't getting any food therefore you lose weight.      2. I have also heard that if you eat more it speeds ur your metabolism therefore making you burn more calories.      Also i have heard that if you do #1 that you actually gain weight because your body savors every calorie it gets. But i have also heard that you gain weight in #2 because you get more calories and it cant burn as many as your getting so you gain weight.       So which theory is correct. :If you say both PLeaaase explain why because i just dont know anaymore thankss

He told me he was getting up at half 9, so I am going to wait for him to shower etc before I do as he has to go to work. 9.45- he's still in bed, I just want to know when he'll be leaving so I can get on with my day. He just says he's getting up. He doesn't actually get up until 10.45, but every time I ask him he just says 'I AM getting up' even though lying in bed. I felt so frustrated I didn't know what to do or why he kept saying that to me when he wasn't actually getting up, making me wait and waste an hour thinking I couldn't use the shower as he was about to. I went to the kitchen, grabbed a razor and hacked at my arm. He doesn't know. I am shocked, I don't know why I've done this- it seems so odd. Do I have a problem? I don't know what to do. Should I tell my boyfriend or a friend? I'm scared I could go mental like that.

20090203025728AAMpUxO	Health;Mental Health	"Seroxat" as a cause for sleeping disorders? help?	hey,      so basically, i'm taking "seroxat" daily cuz i have ocd. i've been taking it for a few years, and i had a lot of problems with sleeping for these past few years. so a few months ago i decided to stop taking the meds, and after a month or so the sleeping disorder vanished as i predicted (i always thought it was the seroxat causing it). however the ocd symptoms had risen dramatically as well, so now i started taking it again, and the sleeping disorders started again too.      now, it looks like i'm gonna have to live with the pill, because i definitely feel much better when i'm on it anxiety-wise. but i was wondering if anyone experienced these problems too, and do you have any suggestions as to solving it.      note - my problem with sleeping is actually the falling a sleep part. i just can't seem to relax my mind a fall asleep. i have to be really really tired to actually fall asleep and that results in sleeping a really long time - over 10 hours at least - due to the tiredness. this way every night i go to sleep later and later and every morning i wake up much later too.       well, thanks a lot in advance :-)
20090203030005AA6Bx1U	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Will constant all-nighters cause long-term problems?	To define "constant", i'm talking about 3-4 a week. Every week. At least one instance of 2 in a row every week.   The other 3-4 days I get from 5-9 hours of sleep. But they'll be from 4-5am, till noon-ish.      Contrary to what I've read, I don't experience any decrease in mental or physical ability, and I'm fairly sure my body has adapted quickly to this.      Am I at any immediate health risks? Or more importantly any long-term health risks?      Any input, ideas, suggestions, are welcomed.      Thanks.

20090203032042AAEQRqC	Health;Mental Health	Is this Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.?	Someone bullied me at work by yelling at me and invading my space. When I saw them again, they were ok to me, but I had a panic attack and imagined that person was going to harm me. I imagined it was my mom in her place. She used to beat me up and yell. All I could do was curl up in the chair, limp. I felt so much fear that I reacted as though she was going to hit me.      Weeks after this, I was suffering such bad anxiety; not being able to concentrate, I would feel fear at the sight of this person's phone number on the wall at work, be bad tempered and not sleep well until I was prescibed anti-depressants.

20090203034521AAwuqWg	Health;Alternative Medicine	I have a dilemma... opinions please? I am a qualified remedial massage therapist. I work at a clinic...?	I also have my own massage room at home where I massage friends and family for half the price that my work charges. Here's my problem:      A friend-of-a-friend asked if she could buy her boyfriend a gift of having a sports massage with me at my home. Of course I said yes since I had massaged this girl before and knew her boyfriend fairly well. My husband also knows the couple. So after the girl decided to give her boyfriend a massage with me, my husband told me he didn't like the idea. It was ok with him for me to massage women at home, but not men. If I was massaging the boyfriend at my work it would be a different story. I think that's ridiculous. Anyway, the girl gave her boyfriend the massage as a gift and he has contacted me to make an appointment. I told him I'll be available soon but not now, which he said was fine. But I don't know what to do... listen to my husband and just tell the guy I can't massage him for some reason, or just do it because I see nothing wrong with it. To me it doesn't matter where the massage takes place, it's still the same massage. It's a sports massage which is pretty painful for most people, but my husband doesn't like the idea of me being alone in a room at home with another man massaging him even though it's a common occurrence at work. He thinks it's different because it's at home, I think there's no difference at all. What do you think?

I go through stages in my life, where I just don't know what I want to do or be anymore, people can tell i'm getting frustrated with myself and always try to suggest things, like places to go, things to buy or options to go in my life and i just go yeah yeah that's a good idea and NEVER follow up on it...I have piles of paper work and stuff to get through at home to try and relieve the stress, and i never do it...      It's almost like i get to place on my life where i'm happy, then I don't want it anymore, I make great Friends and live in nice places, and a few months or years i'm outta there, I don't even know why i don't keep in touch with those people. its like i don't fight for what i want, i think, if this is how its meant to be. etc.       It's like i'm in a major rut, but am scared to change it (because of the hard work it entails) only to get somewhere and not be happy again.

I'm not enjoying anything or looking forward to anything, or planning anything to cheer myself up, I just think yeah that will be good for one night but what about the next day....I feel like i cant be happy, because i should have had what i always wanted by now, if i havent got it its not meant to be....      basically i just wanted to fall madly in love, have someone cherish me enough to marry me, and have a great family life,...but now i don't think anyone ever will, this is because i'm deeply unhappy in myself and have these issues with not knowing what i want outta life etc. how can anyone love me.

20090203035819AA0mgRb	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Ulcer. Need some advice?	I have a history of abdominal pain, which has usually been associated with Menstration and fertility problems. I've been having constant abdominal pain for about 3 weeks now, the past week has been pretty severe. I went to the clinic last Friday and the Dr. said she thinks I have an Ulcer. She prescribed an acid reduction drug and sent me for blood and FOBC. The pain has not improved, and I am starting to get worried. Here is a little background.   I am 24 years old, smoke (trying to quit), heavy coffee drinker. I was taking Naproxen 500 mg 1-2 times/week for 3 years due to a back injury. I am anemic and taking Iron and B12 supplements. I had surgery for a pilonidal cyst 9 months ago and was on codine for 3 weeks post-op. Doc has me off of Naproxen, Iron, B12, coffee and cigs now, but the Acid Reduction pill doesn't seem to be working. I am having pain in my upper back (behind the shoulders) and lower back as well, but I don't know if that is due to the ulcer or being off the Naproxen. I have 1 day of passing blood in stool, a few times that day. Extreme nausea, but only about 3 days vomiting (no blood) I have been fatigued, weak, heart palpitations. My blood pressure is low and I am having bouts of hot and cold flashes.    My question(s) are Is it possible the ulcer could be bleeding? What are the symptoms if it has perforated? How long does it take one to perforate? Should I seek out a second opinion, and a GI exam?

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.

I went to the docs who gave me a full blood test, i have been told this morning that my cholesteral levels have gone mad and i have to go back next week (earliest appointment) to discuss what to do about it.   I am shocked as i am not at all over weight, i am what the docs say the right weight even though i personaly feel underweight, i am 5'11 and now a size 8 - 10 which i feel is to thin for me, i dont eat much meat at all and when i do eat it i cook it without adding any oil or fat, no junk food, dont drink alcohol, so  what else could have caused it?   I have to go and talk about my diet etc with the nurse but if i try and eat any healthier than i already am then i may as well live on lettuce.   I really dont know much at all about high cholesteral but if i am not overweight, eat healthy, dont drink alcohol etc then what else could it be, i am worried sick about it because my dad was diagnosed with high colesteral when he was my age then 3 years later he had a heart attack.  i have to wait untill next week now to find out so i have a full week to worry myself sick about it, can anyone tell me what else could have caused it, and what happens when the cholesteral levels are wrong?

It hurts most when I brush my teeth. I brush my teeth twice a day, use listerine mouthwash and occasionally floss.      I think it might be an ulcer, but I really don't know.

The coughing, sore throat and nasal congestion is over with, for the most part.     I don't have insurance anymore, so I don't feel like going to the doctors and getting a bill. I've gone to the doctor before for this anyway and it's never been helpful. I usually end up trying home remedies anyway.    I think I have a sinus infection now. Constant nose blowing and always blowing green mucus every time.   Starting today, my teeth and nose started hurting every time I blow my nose or cough.    I looked up home remedies and found an apple cider vinegar remedy for sinus infection. But, will this get rid of the infection? And how long do sinus infections usually last?  This stuff is awful! It tastes like somebody boiled a bunch of dirty nasty socks in a pot of water and poured me a cup. But so far breathing out of my nose is easier and coughing is not so rough.  Still hurts the nose and teeth. I'm afraid it's heading towards my ear.    Also, every morning when I wake up, my throat is EXTREMELY sore and doesn't go away until a few hours of being awake.    I was given zicam to try, but not sure if that would be any help because I was under the impression that you're supposed to take it when you feel a cold coming on.. not after you have it.  I also have a prescription decongestant from the last time I went to a doctor. Yes? No?    This sucks. My birthday is the 7th. I don't want to be sick for it! =[

20090205161030AA1Cs8n	Health;Mental Health	Sometimes I withdraw to a fantasy world inside my head- is this schizophrenic?	Let me preface this by saying that I had a very traumatic childhood, and have been depressed for most of my life.      Ever since I was a child, I've had this fantasy world in my head where I am someone else. I've created an entire personality for this "alter ego", a history, friends, basically an entire life.  When I get super stressed or severely depressed, I retreat to this world where I'm someone different.  As far as my real life goes... I barely go through the motions of everyday living. I feel like a shell of a human. It almost feels like my entire existence is inside my head as someone else.      My friends probably don't notice anything weird about my behavior other than when I withdraw from day to day activities, so I know I'm not totally insane.        There are a couple people I talk to on the phone as this "alter ego" (I've never met them) but it scares me because it like I become this person when I talk to them.  Basically, I want to know what disorder or mental illness this is. I am going to go to therapy but I'd like to hear opinions on this issue.  Thanks.

20090205163712AATvoWx	Health;Women's Health	This is no birth control (or combo of birth controls) that are 100% effective, is there?	I had read once that between a spermicidal douche/ foam and condoms, a person should be 100% safe from pregnancy. However, statistics show that the douche is only 20-27% effective, and a condom is something like 87% effective "if used correctly." (no breakage)   Plan B, the "morning after" pill, has a rate similar to condoms but only taken immediately after sex. Plus sperm lives in the vagina up to 6 days, and Plan B has a quoted 72 hour efficiency rate.    Birth control pills taken daily are supposed to be the most effective besides having surgery, but has a estimated failure rate of 1 in 1000.       So basically, unless you have an arsenal of all of the above, and even then, one can still get pregnant. Or am I missing anything?   Is there a birth control method (non surgical) that has worked extremely well for you?
