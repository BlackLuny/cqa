The "Activity" button was very loose and sensitive and it turned out after a while of using it that the software is slower than my last 880.  Anyway, so I contacted Logitech to see what they could do since its under warranty and they said they would send me another one and that I should dispose of the one I have.  They said they disabled it, which means it won't work with the software anymore so you can't program it...      So basically, I'm wondering what I can do with this disabled remote?  Its kind of a waste of materials don't you think?  Is there a way to re-enabled it or maybe program it without the software?

20090131152140AAjCdWX	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PC	I need help with the Sims 2?	I recently went through a bout of nostalgia and dug out my old 'The Sims 2' game and attempted to install it on my Acer Aspire 5315-2698 laptop.      The installation went fine and without a hitch, but when I opened the game itself, it prompted me to choose a neighborhood. I chose one, but it froze the game and I had to end it via Task Manager. I try this a few more times, getting the same result.       The next time, I chose a different neighborhood. I actually got through to this one. I opened the family creator tab thing and began to make a family.       After I finish the first page of Sim customization, the game freezes. It's usually at the part where you choose a different head for the character.      I don't have any installation packs installed yet, although I have some.       What could be causing this, and how do I fix it?      Thanks in advance!

20090131173422AAyTrYx	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Problem with my iPod Touch and computer (Read Details) Best Answer + 10 pts.?	Hi. Im having this problem with my iPod Touch and my Computer, When I first bought the iPod, I plugged it to the PC (Windows XP), I downloaded iTunes (the latest version), and everything was running fine, like 2 days later, Everytime I plugged the iPod to the computer, the computer restarted, and again, and again, if I unplugged the iPod, the computer would run fine as usual. I tried to search for viruses with Avast, but there was nothing, just one called Cookie, I deleted it, and plugged the iPod again, and the same thing happened, I didnt know what to do, and deleted iTunes like 4 times and installed it agin but no, the same problem happened! So... everytime I wanted to charge my iPod, I would have to put it on the dock for my TV, or a laptop, which my dad doesnt let me install iTunes on, because he thinks it causes viruses!!. But oh well, I called apple, they made me install package 3 on my Windows XP pc but the same happened. So my dad started deleting programs , like games and things we dont use anymore such as files also. And when I plugged the iPod , the computer didnt restart or anything, for almost 3 days, then today, I wanted to charge the iPod Touch since it ran out of battery and it made the PC restart... AGAIN!       So the question is... What causes it and how do I make it so my computer cant shut down when plugging my iPod. And also, If by deleting files and programs from my computer made the iPod work again and charge, should I try searching again for things I dont use or that look suspicious? Well... Thats all, Thanks in advance, I know this is a large question but its also a headache for me to see my iPod in this position.      I will choose best answer. Thanks guys!!

HI, my digicam when plugged into my PC (Dell 5100 XP Home) using the USB cable it displays the "Blue screen of death"  (0xc0000005 , etc etc...). The camera on its own is fine, as is my pc. I contacted Samsung tech support they replied with the following answer:                           "I would recommend uninstallingall Drivers and Software installed for Samsung. Go to http://www.samsungcamera.com and run 'Remote Service'. Once ran restart your PC and connect the camera back up. Windows XP already has generic drivers installed.If any other driver is installed this may cause instability on your PC system. The Driver availible for this camera is only compatible with Windows 98/ME."  I fully uninstalled all drivers etc regarding Samsung but then got stuck trying to find the "remote service" (whatever this is?). I followed the exact link to the site but could not locate the "remote service"? Im still awaiting a reply from Samsung regarding this query but has anyone out there got any better suggestions? or could anyone at least explain what the "remote service" is , what it does and where to find it?  cheers , Daz.

The original iPod was firewire based and many PCs at the time didn't have a firewire port.

Maybe it has to do with the iTunes software for Windows, but I can't find any sources online for MicroSoft's involvement either.

20090131191631AAEsOzy	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Ripping / Skipping! When I rip CDs to my hard drive for MP3 conversion, I get skipping on some tracks! Help!?	Every time I rip a CD converting to MP3, I end up with little click sound and skipping / missing bits and it always occurs about 3/4 the way thru the CD. For ex., a CD with 24 tracks has skips begin in track 18, most of track 19, and go away again by track 20.  I thought maybe this was due to a problems with my cd drive but I just installed a brand new 52X cd/dvd burner today and the problem is exactly as it was before. EXACTLY!  The problem does not appear to be coming from the cds, they never skip when played in a cd player. And yet most CDs seem to skip when converted. What gives?  Does the software and drive not have the common sense to slow down if it can't read the data correctly from the drive? Is this a common problem or am I the only one experiencing this?

And anyone have a fix for this?      If you want additional information just add it to your reply and i'll add it in when i read it ;)      Thanks      - BillyZhuk
