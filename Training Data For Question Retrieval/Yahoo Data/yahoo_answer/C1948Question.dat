I'm trying to hook up my newer HD players to my Onkyo TS-D555 receiver, and of course the manual is no help and the Onkyo Customer Support no longer covers my model. So my question is this: when hooking up HD Players (like my PS3, Toshiba HD-DVD player, Comcast Cable box) to the Receiver via optical audio, does the Receiver need to be on a special input for the optical port to output sound? Whenever I plug something in via optical nothing comes out of the speakers? I have tried it on DVD, Tape, CD, and Video 1.      I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with this model or Onkyo products in general that might be able to help.      Thanks!

I was at a friend's house today with my iPod touch and I was attempting to connect to one of the various wireless networks available in his neighborhood. My touch is a second generation and my friend has a first generation. Whenever he would search for networks, he would get like eight or ten, whereas I would get two or none. He would successfully get this one network (called default) which had full strength, and when I would have my iPod in the same place, it would not find it. Is there any reason for this? I just don't see why his iPod would be getting more wireless networks than mine because it is older.

20090220192003AAG9P4m	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	GTAIV Lost and the Damned won't load after download?	I downloaded the new GTA IV "Lost and the Damned" on release day.  My wife and I each have our own profile.  The first time she put the GTAIV disc in the unit, it prompted her and said "New Download Detected, would you like to play?"  She said yes and she can access the game.      In my own profile, I'm never prompted.  I downloaded the game in my own profile, but for some reason, she can play and I can't.

20090220201119AANKBw7	Consumer Electronics;TVs	What's Wrong with my Rear-Projection TV?	It worked fine, with no indications of any problem until yesterday.   Now, it's got problems.  It's an older model Zenith Rear-Projection TV (RPTV).      If the DVD/VCR is turned on, then we get sound, but absolutely nothing on the screen.  Not even static; just complete darkness.  Not even a menu will show.      If we disconnect the DVD/VCR, then we still get nothing on the screen, and we lose all sound; we just hear static.      I hooked up another TV to the Video Out terminals (on the Rear Projection TV), and the new TV showed the picture and sound coming out of the Rear Projection TV (but again, only if the DVD/VCR was turned on).   If I turned the DVD/VCR off, we lost both the sound and the picture on both TVs.      Since the DVD/VCR seemed to be involved, I tried unplugging the cable from the back, and plugging it straight into the Rear-Projection TV.  When I tried that, we still had absolutely no picture (not even static, just complete darkness on the screen) and the sound was gone (complete static).      But if I plugged the cable back into the DVD/VCR, the picture comes back on the TV attached to the Rear-Projection TV (still absolutely nothing on the screen of the RPTV but blackness) and the sound comes back crystal clear on the RPTV.      So, anyone have any ideas?  Why is there no picture on the RPTV?  Why is there sound, but only if the DVD/VCR is on?  Why, when I attach a second TV to the RPTV, it gets the picture and sound, but only if the DVD/VCR is on?
20090220203421AArLyjM	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Do you agree Fallout 3 should have been awarded Game of The Year Award '08?	Okay,I just got this game around 3 weeks ago(for Xbox 360),and once I finally got the hang of playing it(using the V.A.T.S, plus the Karma system), I concluded that Fallout 3 is BETTER than GTA IV in replay value, interactivity and storyline( 16 endings! ).      Do you agree?       P.S : By the way, lets have this little poll; how many of you chose evil over good?   (I chose evil ! No offense to the good-do-ers!)

20090220201600AAfF8qX	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	The Canon Powershot SX10 IS or S5 IS?	I need to purchase a new camera very soon, my S3 IS just broke and I was very impressed by it, but I figure it's time for me to move on.  I love everything I'm seeing about the Canon Powershot S5 IS, thus far pictures from the SX10 IS for some reason haven't impressed me, maybe it's just me but the photo quality seems a tad shabby/noisier compared to the S3 IS and S5 IS.     The main things I'm looking for in the both of them is photo quality of course, how well portrait photographs are and the best video captured.  I know people claim there isn't really much of a difference in them but I can't help but feel like there is.   I have a credit loan at Best Buy, but Best Buy is only carrying SX10 IS at the moment so I'm torn because I have my heart set on the S5 IS.  So, what do you think?  Any input to lead me in the right direction?   Thanks so much in advance!

20090220200907AAs1TsY	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Warranty on Xbox question. Really upset?	I got a Xbox for my birthday at Best Buy I believe on July 22nd, 2007. I have called Xbox like 3 times already and they have a new excuse everytime. They say I need a warranty extension to even send it in which would cost me $100.00 not only do I not have that, but it's only $99.00 away from a brand new one? And I definitely do not have that. Is it just me, or they extended the warranty to 3 years? Why can't I send it in? It isn't the Red Ring of Death, but when I plug it in I can hear sound, but no picture I have spent $50.00, or so which I didn't have to purchase new A/V jacks and such and nothing works. Help I'm stuck.

20090220201820AA6YR5Z	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	Harassing calls bothering my girlfriend!?	Ok, so here's the story. Some guy is calling my girlfriend on RESTRICTED and he's been harassing her for the past MONTH already. I want to put an end to this and trace him down. I suspect he may live close to her because whenever I go to her house, he would not call, but the next day when I'm home, he calls. Yesterday, he kept calling her and the calls increased and the calls are about 16 calls a day now. He says "I finally found you, I finally found you". BUT when I picked her up at night, he DID NOT call. I picked her up around the time the harasser calls. Today, I dropped her off and I HAD THE PHONE with me, and then HE CALLS. What a ***** right? I think I scared him because he wouldn't say anything. My guess is that a neighbor is spying on her. I would DEEPLY appreciate it if anyone can tell me how to trace him number down. My girlfriend has AT&T for the service provider.

20090220203055AAu4WCd	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Why is Cricket Wireless ghetto?	I had Cricket for three months and the coverage sucked, you don't get a good signal ever, i live in Kansas City and in one part of the city i will have a signal and in another there is no signal at all. Another problem i had with them is that everymonth that i payed they would disconnect my phone and i always had to go to the store for them to reconnect it, this happened every month for three months that i had the phone and they disconnected me again, and i asked them what the problem is and they said that i didn't pay one month. The guy that sold me the phone reconnects it for one day and the next day it gets disconnected again, when he isn't there the other guys don't want to reconnect it, and the guy that sold me the phone said that i did pay, but his buddies that work a different shift are saying that i didn't pay, and i have the receipts. They give a month of free service and they expect you to pay that after a couple of months. In the commercials they advertise like they are a great phone company but as soon as you leave your house there is no signal. When i went to the store to complain, there were a lot of pissed off people. How can they sell some shitty *** phones and service without not being afraid of pissing the wrong people off and having some of their sales people getting their *** kicked by someone? Some dude at cricket said that he buys phones and he will buy my phone, do you think that i should go to the cricket store and just throw the piece of **** phone against the concrete and break it for them to see how much their phones suck?          http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/0/42...        http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/0/33...

20090220212900AAKCxQ0	Consumer Electronics;TiVO & DVRs	My better VCR shows worse picture?	I have a cheap Radioshack VCR, and have had it for years. Shows super clear picture, you can see individual strands of a persons hair blowing in the breeze, etc I have a mid-range quality Admiral that shows an equally clear picture.      Neither of these have an S-video output however but I could make pretty good dubs using composite rca. But I wanted to do dubbing the best I could so went looking for a better VCR. First I got a Sony and immediately noticed that the picture was not clear, showed no depth, and looked like it had some kind of noise filter switched on all the time. That is the only way I can explain it      So I took it back and exchanged it for a medium high quality JVC HRS model with the famous 19mil head and all of that and was assured this would give me as clear a picture as any. The results were the same, everything looks blurry, filtered, and is miserable to look at compared to my $129 RadioShack.       I thought well, I am viewing old tapes, recorded with an old two head vcr most likely, so perhaps I need an older VCR to view them. But this is not the case, as the newer JVC shows everything worse, and the older VCRs play everything better.       Does anyone have an idea why this is happening or what i should do about it? Thanks for taking the time to read this

Then I held the off button and it was still showing the web page and I kept sliding at the top (like you do to turn it off)      Then I waited for 5 minutes and it turned off, I tried to turn it back on but it just stayed on the apple logo for 10 seconds, flashed white, and went back to the apple logo and repeated that atleast 15 times, until it finelly went black.      I thought it was the battery at first, but it's not because it has been on charge for atleast 2 hours now, and still wont turn on.      Any more details you need just ask here and I'll update.

20090220205457AAhcd2f	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Should I get a Wii? ... simply for the fun & novelty of it?	Hi People      I've never played on a Wii before, but I'm interested in getting one simply for the fun & novelty of it.      I'd like to know if it's worth doing so, objectively speaking, given that:      - I don't plan on using the console in a social context at all. I play purely alone.   - I'm grown up and typically into conventional gaming (e.g. PS3) ... but I feel I may appreciate the unique concept & approach of the Wii console, provided it is executed well.   - right now the only games Wii games I'm keen on buying are Wii Sports, Wii Fit & Big Brain Academy. I'm not aware of any other current (or future) games that would appeal to me.      Any input & opinions would be much appreciated.
