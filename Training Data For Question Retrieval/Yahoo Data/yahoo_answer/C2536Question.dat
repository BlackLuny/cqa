20080803163635AAImTfJ	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Volkswagen	Golf mk III engine temperature?	I just bought a 94' Golf mk III 1.8 petrol, and i was wondering whether it is normal for the temperature gauge to be around 70 C? When i get off the motorway, it goes up to 80, but usually hovers around 70 (and actually mostly a bit below it).       Is that too cold? Does it damage the engine if driven like that?      Thanks

20081020084604AA0HC5W	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	New driver-Probation period- pulled over?	I got pulled over by a police car, when i was driving my uncle's car. They asked me for my details, which i gave and asked If i was Insured? I actually thought i was insured to drive the car, so i said i think i am. They gave me a producer to produce mot, proof of insurance and driving license. When i got home and asked my uncle, i found out I wasn't insured. I've been driving for over a year and still in probation period. I'm insured(third party) on my car, which i use for commuting to university. I fear that i will get 6points on my license and my license will be taken off me and have to resit the test. I would like to know how long it will take before i can resit the test after the ban?       I need my license to get to university, as living in accomodation at university is too expensive and quite frankly i cannot afford it. I need advice to whether just go the police staion and admit that i'm guilty? or how can i plea my case to a magistrate?       (i know driving withouth insurance is illegal and the only the reason i drove his car was because the insured driver who was my passenger had bad legs and feeling really tired, and we stopped for a break but he was still tired. we were only less than 5miles away from house, so i drove thinking i was insured) that still is not a good execuse for driving without insurance which i'm aware off.       I don't really know what to do, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

20081230102729AA84UG5	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I need an exhaust system for a car that doesn't exist?	Let me explain.   It is a Mitsubishi Pajero jeep but the problem is that it's an import vehicle and is not recognised by the local repair centres. It's an R Reg but was first registered in England about 4 years ago. The local garage say it is actually a Panin? Pinin? model ( not exactly sure what he said ) and shouldn't have the Pajero badge on it.    I had the same problem getting it insured when I bought it as about 12 companies said it didn't exist.   I would appreciate any help with this problem. Any dealership who you think might help would need to be located near me I.E. in the County Durham/Newcastle area.

20081116132806AA4zRNp	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Nissan	Can someone answer my Clutch query?	Hi all,       I have a manual Peugeot 306, and I think my clutch needs adjusted for the following reason:      From neutral with the engine running, I try and put the car into 1st gear it doesn't go in.    If I try and put it into reverse, the reverse gear will grind.         If I switch the engine off, I can put it into any gear no problem (even without the use of the clutch) then when I turn on the ignition, the car will drive (my foot is on the clutch)      PS Over the last 2 weeks, on some days (not all) I've noticed it has been harder to get into the gears when driving. Now it won't at all.   I've also noticed the biting point has been lower down than usual.      I'm sure I don't need a new clutch because it wasn't slipping at all.      Am I right in saying it needs adjusted? Or is there something else wrong?      Thanks,      Steven

20081122164103AA9oiPY	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why does my engine rev less when I turn my lights on in the cold?	If its cold and I start my car the engine revs higher than normal for a minute or so. Someone told me this is the auto choke kicking in. While this is happening if it turn electrical items on such as interior light, electric window or the (outside) lights the engine revs less, by about 100-150 revs or so.       This confuses me because surely there's a piece of equipment in there that knows to warm the engine up more but how come this piece of equipment doesn't rev it even more when I turn electrical stuff on.

I already know what I want(a light duty truck, light on gas but can still get me around my rural town and the farms and mountains around). my father and I found a pretty nice truck, a  2002 Ford Ranger. it's priced at 6900 dollars, but I only have 3200 saved up. The dealer will only finance to me for a year(the payments being 300+ dollars, which is harsh what with school and sports). The bank might finance, but my brother went through the bank at my age and it was a bad struggle(I don't want to go through that). Should I wait over the summer, make some more $ for a larger down payment and smaller monthly? Or should I go ahead and go for this truck? Or should I get my parents' help on financing it(meaning they'll basically have another something to threaten me with, take away, or ground me from, lol!!!).

It felt like a stiff neck 100x worse. And then my rotweiler went flying on the floor. Hes fine, luckly he likes sitting in the back.   After 5 minutes the pain went away. The ambulance checked me out and siad you may get some slight muscle pain tomorrow.   The guy behind the guy behind me hit him and pushed him into me.    My car rear bumper is scraped with white paint on it and my inside rearview mirror broke off. Now im getting some serious squeaking sound in the front of my car when i hit a bump coming from the suspension. I never had that. Its like a creaking.   Anyone know what that means?   Do you think they will pay me to get my car fixed.   2 big suvs hit me . Im lucky i didnt get hurt.

20090205174631AA8YEku	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	What does it mean to have a hold on my drivers license?	So, I went to the DMV today to renew my license and I was told I had a hold on my license. It isn't suspened, because they didn't take my current license, but it has a hold on it.       What I am wondering is what exactly that means. I am in California, btw.      My other question has to do with how I get the hold lifted. I have the hold because of a failure to appear for a speeding ticket. I have since then set up a payment plan with a financial services place, so I thought that took care of everything. I didn't get to call the city that gave me the ticket today (they were closed), but I did call the place that I am paying and they told me that the hold will probably stand until I am done paying. Is that true? Or will the city lift the hold because I have a payment plan set up?

My daughter, who is 11, misbehaved at my ex husbands house according to him. My daughter needed materials for a school project so he purchased the materials for her project. When it was time to go back to my house, he decided to not give my daughter the supplies she needed for her project that week just because she misbehaved. The next day, she called him and asked him if he could have those things because she needed them the next day. He said NO because of her behavior. As a mother, I wanted her to have her materials for the next day, so we went to the store and got the materials. It cost me $15. Should I have not of got those things just because she misbehaved at her father's house and let her get a bad grade. (fyi...my daughter is a straight A student) I want her to do well in school I bought her the materials. What would you do????

20090205173728AAfaDfb	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;GMC	1993 Suburban 4x4 Transmission problem?	From a dead stop, when the truck is in Drive or OD it will not start in 1st gear; so I would have to manually downshift, but can only engage 2nd gear. And when I drive in OD on the freeway, at 65MPH the tach reads 3k when I accelerate. But when I let up on the gas the tach drops to 1k. It feels like I do not have 1st or OD gear. Is the tranny gone? Is there any hope of easy fix?
20090205173817AA5ZUFi	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	2000 Ford F150 Senors In Air Intake?	My 2000 F150 started running bad and the computer said it was a sensor that is located on the rubber connector on the air intake tube. (I forget the name of the sensor) That was replaced, and still got the same error code. The parts store gave me another sensor for free and still the same code. I looked under the truck and on the air intake tube underneath, there is a similar looking sensor. Does anyone know the name of this second one? Are the two associated with eachother?

When I took my car reverse from parking lot, my car front bumper lower portion got hit on a pole, and I have some scraches and a small dent on it.       Its a 1 year old car in excellent condition.    Here are my insurance details :       coverage    Limit / Deductible   -----------------------------   BODILY INJURY/PROPERTY DAMAGE 100/300/100   UNINSURED MOTORIST BI 50/100   COMPREHENSIVE 100   COLLISION 500   ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT 1000        Now, my question is :    I got estimate from an autobody repair shop to replace my front bumper with original OEM bumper. The estimate comes to $1020. If I go through my insurance company, how much would my insurance company pay. If I claim insurance for this :    1. Will it create a bad record in my drivers record (My drivers record is clean. I just had one speed ticket and I went to driving school got it cleared).   2. Will it create entry in my carfax. I feel this is only something cosmetic and just out of the care I have my car, I do replace with original OEM bumper.    Please explain me this in two scenarios :    1. If it is done by me while I take out of parking lot.    2. I parked my vehicle in some mall and went for shopping, when I come out of the mall, I see dent and scratches on my Front bumper.    Kindly advise me ASAP.   Thanks in advance,

Also, can you charge your cell phone through your usb port on your deck with a usb cord instead of using the car cigarette lighter?

Its problems may not be fatal, but we have neither the money nor the  inclination to try and get it back on its feet (or, rather, its wheels).  Another problem is that we are moving out of state in about a week and a half, so our time is limited.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to what we might (legally) do with it?

Got the car worked on (transmission I think) in July, drove fine until November. The clutch faded and it was out of commission. Couldn't get it fixed for 3 weeks. Finally got to the shop, worked fine for a week, then the clutch faded. Went back to the shop, got it back, clutch faded within two weeks. It's causing financial problems and I need it fixed and clear.
