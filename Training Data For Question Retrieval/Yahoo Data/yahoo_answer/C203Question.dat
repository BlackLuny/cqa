20090227144258AAMnvQs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	In my position, would you suggest my friend to consider an adoption?	I am 16 and a mother to a nine month old boy. When I found out I was pregnant I took night classes and online courses so I could graduate early and take care of my son. I take care of him all day untill my mom gets home from work around five. Then I go to work for minimum wage from 5 to 9.      My friend, 15 and a sophmore in high school, is pregnant with twins. Her boyfriend lives in a different town and they broke up shortly before she found out she is pregnant. She plans on staying in school and getting a job.       I suggested that maybe she think about adoption, graduating early, or taking classes online. How can she do well in school, work, and take care of TWO kids with no support from her boyfriend?      When I brought up adoption she began screaming at me, even calling me a bad mother for suggesting it. What would you have said to her if you were me?

Do you let your child express themselves??Mine are still young 3 1/2 yrs and 1 yr,but even now I let my son express himself,the other day I was in walmart and we were checking out and this older lady walked up and made a comment about a fake tattoo my son was wearing,it was the Jolly Roger flag,he is in to pirates right now but I was like okay and just ignored her comment but I really got to think about how many parents do allow their children self expression.I think I will let them express their selves in just about anyway they want as long as it doesn't harm them or anyone else(IE drugs,anything really vulgar and anything illegal).I think self expression is important so that they can figure out who they are.      What about you what's you take on Self Expression?

My son will be nine months on the 20th of this month.  just this passed weekend he's started spitting out his baby food a bit and not eating much of it.

When I mentioned it to his baby sitter this morning she made mention of him wanting more texture in his food possibly.

20090227145351AAEbXzA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Diagnosed with PCOS yesterday after a scan. Can i still have children?	I was diagnosed with PCOS yesterday after a scan. I keep having dull pains, sometimes on the right side and sometimes on the left. These dull pains are where the ovaries are i think. Can the cysts cause these pains? they aren't serious cysts i don;t think. The nurse said that my ovaries where "a common case of PCOS".      Also, i have a doctors appointment on monday. I really want to go on Metformin to regularise my periods and help to concieve. I have read good reveiws about this. The nurse said that my doctor might put me on the pill to regularise my periods but i don't want to do this as i want a baby! lol. I really want to try Metformin and maybe Clomiphene if he will let me!

20090309091022AAIwhcw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Could You Stop Her From Doing This?	My daughter, 43, has had 4 cars impounded in 2 years that her dad bought her. She has no license, no license plate , insurance or inspection sticker. No job.   She crashes with people. She continues to call me up and nag, begging for a car. I tell her no, my husband tells her no, she keeps calling , crying and begging. I've had her son, 10,  for 2 years and thought I was doing enough. How can I get her to stop calling me? She has the entire household depressed. Yes; she has a drug problem and lots of warrants. She goes, "I'm not a bad person; I have a good heart." But she keeps calling and I get so tense I can barely sleep. She refuses counseling and men dump her right and left.

My husband suggested last night a "tip" that his 70 yr old boss told him: To ease a baby's teething, rub a lil bit of Rum on the gums. It's supposed to take the pain outta the gums, your just supposed to rub a small drop only on the gums. (his boss swears that it works, my husband doesn't know alot about babies)   okay : I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER DO THIS, but ......   has anyone else ever heard of this? would you try it? is there any truth in this "tip"??   Rude comments will be reported as abuse.

20090309082821AAEOrK1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What should i do about pregnancy and getting no antenatal screening test/blood work done until at least ...?	24/25 weeks pregnant,      i came back from abroad to the UK, I had my 18week appoint with midwife while abroad, so i heard the heartbeat, and had blood pressure taken and measured my stomach.      since coming back i got staight onto my GP, which told me i would have my appointments with a midwife, so really could have been told that over the phone,    I called the midwife last thursday as had no letters through to say when i would have an appointment, i told her that i have had no blood work done at all, and asked when will i get this done if i could had ust arranged for the nurse to take my blood, she said no and that i would get that done when i have my first visit at the hospital which will be at least 1month or 5weeks she said, i was 20weeks when i called just last thursday and explained to her that means i will be 25weeks before getting any blood work done, she said it doesnt matter you will get the blood done then at 25weeks when i go along for my scan.      i got really upset about this on the thursday as before i was due to come back to the UK the midwives at my 18week appoint had wanted it done then, my flight was scheduled at same time as i would had got bloods done, and i thought it will be ok will get them done when i get home, but ive only came back here to be told from the midwife on the phone that i will get them when i go to hosp for my first appoint in a months time.      im trying to get through to  my health visitor today at my medical centre to see what they say about this,      what else can i do, does this seem right or wrong to you?

20090227145848AAskQR1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do I talk to my step-dad about my step-brothers horrible diet?	My step-brother is 12 and all he eats is mac and cheese, pizza, and pasta.  My step-dad doesn't realize how horrible this is on his system and the lack of nutrients he is getting.  I am a nutritionist and personal trainer and he won't even listen to what I have to say, or what my mom has to say.  He does not look overweight, but I know his fat content is way above normal.  Once he hits puberty and continues to eat like this because his dad doesn't care or understand he is going to be so fat.  Last time we went out to dinner he ordered (from cheesecake factory which gives you a huge serving) five cheese ravioli, but instead of getting it with the tomato sauce it comes with, he asked for alfredo sauce instead.  He had three sodas with dinner also, and a piece of cheesecake to himself.  Its just so insulting to be in the profession I am in and to be completely ignored is just so hard.  My step-father is also a big wuss and won't discipline his kid or tell him to eat healthy and lets him do whatever he wants.  I'm concerned about his health and I think he is too old to be at a point where he stills eats like a 5 year old.  Any suggestions from other professionals or parents?

I live in the Uk where it is legal to be served and buy alcohol. The problem is that I find they are growing up too fast and I feel I've lost my control over them especially my daughter. I've never really had a problem letting them have the odd drink but now they are legal adults and I can't tell them what to do. They are planning on going out drinking with their friends to celebrate, and this really worries me. Is there any advice that I could give them that would discourage them from drinking?

I definately dont have any spurs of energies for anything lol...Does that mean I am going into labor soon or that I am already in early labor. Going to see the dr later today. Thanks

20090309092809AANzgs3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I'm extremely worried & need some advice?	Ok, so my yum yum has turned 7 mths old today yahhh!! Anyway, I've been breastfeeding for the entire 7 mths and have been doing well enough thus far. I went back to work in January and have been pumping in order to keep providing her with milk. Recently within the past 2 weeks i've noticed a significant drop in my supply which has me worried. Normally I am able to pump 5 or more ozs from 1 breast at one time or sometimes it takes pumping both to accomplish this but now even by pumping both breast i'm barely getting 3ozs. This is really bothering me because i'm concern she's not getting enough to eat. I'm about ready to head out to the store to pick up some sort of formula but i'm holding out because i'm not ready to give her that. This entire weekend I've been nursing steadily & my nipples are sore. Has anyone else experienced this.      Also, my period hasn't return as yet but i've been having cramps off & on which feels like period pains and have had 1 day of slight spotting which I gathered that my period was returning but then just as it started it stopped. Could this possibly be the reason why my milk has taken a dramatic drop because my period is returning & what might you suggest i do/take to get my supply back up?

20090309095328AAOqVeP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do you see only your OB for everything during pregnancy?	I went to the ER Saturday night for some cramping and brown/red clumpy discharge when I pee. I was sent up to L&D. They took urine and blood and told me that my white count was really high indicating an infection and to get checked out for a cough that I have had. They also said I need to drink 12-14 8 oz glasses of water a day and that the babies were fine. So I went to to doctor today to have the cough checked on and ask them about some pain I was having in my kidney that started this morning. They took urine and came back saying there was blood in my urine but they aren't going to give me anything for the kidney infection that if my OB wants me to have antibiotics he can give them to me. Then she said that I should see my OB for everything, even the cough. I had never heard this before. My first pregnancy I saw my GP for me and my OB for the baby, second my GP was my OB. So should I only be seeing my OB for everything? Babies and me being sick?

20090309095452AAJjSap	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	At what age can a child decide not to live with a parent?	I have a 14 year old male cousin. Two years ago, his mother divorced his step father (who raised him) From then on, his mother has changed so much. she doesn't see her 7 year old daughter (from her ex husband) but about once every 2 or 3 months, she kicked  her 17 year old out because she got pregnant, and she let my cousin hop around from friends house to friends house, no caring where he is. she brings home different guys literally every week. and my cousin is fed up with her, he gets attached to some of these men she brings home then a week later she breaks up with them. she wont even give my cousin lunch money to eat at school, or buy school supplies he needs. well to get to the point, he doesn't want to live with his mother any more, he wants to come stay with me, which is fine with me, but the only way his mother agreed to him staying with me is if she doesn't have to pay for any of his needs, and We would need help with certain things for him, like insurance, school cloths ETC. When is a child able to decide he doesn't want to live his mother. I am the only place he has to go besides friends houses. If we had to prove his mother an unfit parent, we could, easily, but id rather not have to take her to court, I am only 20 and my fiance is 23 therefor i don't know if the system would even consider granting us custody.   thanks for any info and sorry sooo long
20090309100408AA3rRwd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Stuffy/runny nose in pregnancy?	Hey all, for those who don't know my story, We have been ttc for 19 months after being on the DEPO shot, we finally got pregnant but lost our baby at 9 1/2 weeks in december 2008. we recently began TTC again this  cycle. well i am now 10 days late on my 30 day cycle. I test when I was three days late and got a BFN... but i have had sore nipples, headaches and heartburn, so I really thought I was pregnant, but after the BFN, i figured AF was on her way, but i have yet to see her. Starting yesterday I began having a runny, yet clogged up nose, and i still have it today (stuffed up) followed by sneezing every now and then. I bought another test this morning and will test tomorrow morning, but i was just curious as to whether or not this is a symptom in pregnancy? I don't have any other signs of this being caused by allergies, my eyes are not watery/itchy, my throat doesn't hurt...   any info is greatly appreciated! =)

20090309102740AAcKxtL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents vs. Non-Parents!!?	So a question was just asked about the Special parking spots for Families with small children. And If it annoys you when other people park their without children.       And that brings me to my question. Why does it feel like it is the Parents vs. non-parents? Why does it feel like people without children look down at people with children?      For example I was shopping with my son at the time he was about 4 months old. I was alone just the two if us. I was walking down a small aisle with my son in one arm the car seat on the buggies I was pushing with one hand (My son was crying so I had to hold him to calm him down) as I was going down the aisle on the right side of the aisle just like the traffic flow (in the U.S.) when a woman and dressed in business attire with her nose in the air coming down from the opposite direction (same side) and she almost hits me. (I stopped) Have you ever tried to push a cart with one are holding your child and trying to turn a cart? (It's hard) So I was thinking if I just stop and let her go around that would be the best. But she comes down fast and stops just short of hitting me and gives me this look like move out of my way.       I said to her can you go around I have my hand full here. AND SHE tells me "Not my Fault" I was so shocked I have never been treated like that before. And she didn't move. I said well I'm on the right side here your not and I am not the one that looks to be in a rush so you just might be sitting here past your lunch break. She is sitting there for a sec. And then as she is moving around me she gives a big huff and said people with children always thinking there better than others.      OMG I’m I crazy? I thought I was being very considerate. Was I not?

20090309091800AADDdIJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	When did your child start helping themselves to food?	My 3 year old has taken to not waking me up in the morning, as she can pull a chair to the fridge, get out a yoghurt (or more likely 2 of them) and get a spoon from the drawer then eat it all before she wakes me. This morning, I got up and found her hiding in her room with a couple of milky ways that I didn't even know we had! (believe me, had I known, I'd have eaten them myself long ago) Then this afternoon, she's just turned up with a bowl of dry cereal - and she got her bowl, the cereal and poured it without any mess may I add!   So... firstly, what can I do to encourage her independant side but discourage the sneaky treats? (without putting cupboard locks etc on)   Also, when did your child start helping themselves?
20090309103459AAkA3Zw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should he be taking our son to his parents when I'm not welcome there?	My boyfriend and I have a 2 month old son and I have a 4 year old (from a previous marriage).  First of all, my boyfriend broke up with me when I was 8 weeks pregnant and didn't really speak to me until I was 7 months pregnant. I tried to included him in my pregnancy, but you can't force things, so I let go and focused on the future of raising my 2 boys.   Well, things have since changed.  After a lot of talking and hashing out feelings, we are giving our relationship another chance.  A lot of our problems was due to unsolicated advices/opinions from people in his life, one of those people being his father.  I don't know the specifics about things he said, but in conversations my boyfriend has had on separate occassions with myself and my parents, he eluded to the fact that his dad and pointed him in the wrong direction, but he realizes he doesn't want things that way.     Long story short, things have been going well with our relationship since our son was born.  (My boyfriend lives about 200 miles away, so we only see him on the weekends.)  My boyfriend's parents are divorced and both are remarried.  His mom and her husband were supportive of my pregnancy even when my boyfriend and I were not communicating.  They came by nearly every weekend to visit our son after he was born.  Obviously I have negative feelings towards his father due to the negative suggestions he was making during my pregnancy.  Him and his wife had nothing to do with my pregnancy and never came to see their grandchild in the hospital or anytime in the weeks after he was born.  They began hasseling my boyfriend that they wanted to see him, and wanted him to bring him out to their house for the day. However, I am not welcome to be there.  My boyfriend won't come right out and say that, but originally he had said we were all going on there, and then at the last minute said it wasn't a good idea for me to go.  (Also, I am exclusively breastfeeding)   I more than vented my feelings to him about this.  I told him that I feel that my feelings are expendable to him when it come to his father.  I don't feel that it is right for him to take our son out there when I'm not welcome to be a part of it.  Afterall, he is OUR son and they shouldn't be calling the shots.  Its not that I want to be out there spending time with them, but I feel that it should be my choice whether or not I go.  I shouldn't be told that I'm not welcome.   I feel that if he wants things to work with us than he needs to step up and stand up to his dad and his wife.  If we are going to be a family, we are a family full time, not part time.  I told him I think its garbage that the 4 of us (my boyfriend, myself, my 4 year old, and our 2 month old) go out to his mom's together but only my boyfriend and our 2 month old are welcome at his dad's.   I thought after I expressed my feelings the first time that things would change.  But my boyfriend did it again. I know better than to be the type of person to issue an ultimatum, but I don't feel that what is going on is right.  It hurts me everytime it happens.  I want to talk about it again but I do want it to turn into an ugly fight.     Am I wrong for feeling this way?  I feel like I should tell him that if he isn't going to stand up for me and for our family than I need to walk away from our relationship.  We can be friends but that is all.  I can't continue in a relationship where my feelings don't matter.

I had such bad morning sickness that all I did was lay on the sofa feeling nauseous or curled up in the bathroom floor so I could be close to the toilet. I had morning sickness until about 20 weeks. I couldn't go anywhere, eat much, or do anything without vomiting. So I  am just wondering how y'all run around and keep up with a toddler when you have killer morning sickness? Is it as bad as I'm anticipating?

He literally baked a pie and then broke it up into homemade vanilla ice cream.  IT IS SO GOOD.  I just snuck a bowl into my room like a little kid, hiding it behind my back from my 3 year old.      That makes me mean huh?   AND is snuck a word?  Because I think I'm making it up.  It sounds weird the more I say it.
20090309094157AApUBoZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Soaked a liner at 25 weeks?	I'm 25weeks along and sitting at work talking on the phone i felt "disharge" but it was real obvious. I tried to tighten my muscles like stopping urine but it didn't stop at all. It happened 3 amounts in a row.  I got off the call and went to the bathroom and I soaked through my liner and through my panties leaving the back of my dress damp. It didn't smell like urine and it was kinda no color i guess from what I could tell.  Doctor said could be normal discharge but that's A LOT. literally soaked through. And I didn't drink much this morning and didn't have to pee so I didn't think it was urine because I know you can wet yourself on accident when your pregnant.  So doc isn't worried. Said to just watch and if it happens throughout the day to let him know.  Any tips or ideas?

20090309104701AAJVwPM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could exposing myself to these cleaning products have hurt my baby?  I'm so scared.  Maids, hospital workers..?	I am likely being paranoid and I keep trying to calm myself by reminding myself that lots of people work around chemical during their pregnancy.  Anyway, there was 2 times yesterday.  Generally I clean with vinegar and water, but I had to pee and my husband had a poker night the night before.  I was not sitting on a toilet after a bunch of drunk guys peed (likely all over it).  So I grabbed the Fantastik, sprayed and wiped.  No gloves or anything, but it was brief.  I have done this mayb e a half dozen times through my pregnancy.      THEN...OMG!!!  I needed to go rest my aching back...I'm 39 weeks pregnant.  I lay in bed and was adjusting my pillows and knocked my FULL glass of GRAPE juice on my white carpet.  I was home alone and couldn't let it sit there.  I opened the bedroom window and grabbed the Rug Doctor Spot Remover (great stuff).  It didn't smell too terrible at the time.  I doused the area, but had to be quite close while I was spraying.  I tried my best no to breathe it in too much.  That took maybe 5 minutes.  I let it soaked then scrubbed a little.  The stain is gone, but I'm scared this exposure could have hurt the baby.  Again, no gloves .. stupid me.  I have slight anxiety issues as it is.  Yesterday and today I haven't been feeling so well.  Nauseous...but I am close to giving birth.  It could be that or in my crazy head.  Do you think i hurt the baby?
20090309094952AAiN9Hy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 6 month old daughter had not rolled over yet.?	She has had tummy time since she was 2 weeks old. Twice a day for 10-15 minutes as she hated being on her tummy, and still does. Now she is better and can go the whole tummy time without crying just complaining. She almost did it the other day, rolled all the way to her side and almost to her back, but it was like she got scared and rolled back to her stomach and started to cry loudly. She also does push up when on her tummy, and has great head control.I did take her to the Doctor last week and told me not to worry about it because she is sitting up strongly on her own. I would like to get your thoughts. When did your baby roll over? Should I be worried?

20090309091118AAp4W9b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What can I use for my baby to sleep in downstairs?	Hi all, I am mum to a prem baby who is 9 months old (61/2 months old if you take into account her being 10 weeks premature) She usually sleeps in her rocker chair laid back from 7pm until 10pm, then I give her a bottle then take her up to bed with me.    She has now reached the weight that I cannot recline her chair (she is 19lb 10oz, and the maximum weight for the chair is 20lb) and she cant really sleep sitting up!      Is there something else I can put her to sleep in/on of an evening? I don't really want her to sleep in her cot whilst I am downstairs, I just don't feel comfortable with it yet. Any ideas would be appreciated xx

I am on my 8th day AFTER taking the provera. I talked to my doctor today and she said she wants me to take birth control for one month till my period comes. She told me to also come in tomorrow to take a blood test to make sure I'm not prego. I took a HPT today and it was negative. Is this normally what doctors do when your period doesn't start on provera? Put you on birth control for a month?

20090309095034AArYU0K	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My pregnancy test came back negative, but my body is sending mixed signals.  Whats up?	live with my husband, and I have been on the pill for about 9 years. I have not missed any in the past several months, but I was feeling queasy for about 2 weeks prior to starting my period this month. I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative, that was 2 days before I got my period, but it only lasted for 3 days this month and was very light. During the week of sugar pills the sick feeling mostly went away, it only happened when I laid directly on my stomach, or when he wrapped his arms around my tummy at night. I have been feeling tired and moody lately, but I figured that was just the usual PMS symptoms. When I went back on the pills yesterday I started feeling a little more nauseous and funky again. Could my pill be too strong all of a sudden, or could it be amplifying pregnancy symptoms?  I know that the pill tricks your body into thinking it is pregnant, but my body has never acted like this before.  He even tried to make me breakfast and the smell of the bacon made me very ill.  I know these are some of the signs of pregnancy, but my test came back negative.  Could I have taken it too early, at 2 days before I stared.  I normally Start on Wed, Thurs, or Friday.  I started spotting on Tuesday, took the test on Wednesday, then stopped spotting and just started a very light flow on Friday.  My body is confused and even though the test came back negative, I am worried.  Any ideas what is going on.

I was on birth control from Dec02 until Jan09. Last period was (1/24/09)      I do have unprotected sex with my bf of 6yrs but use the "withdraw" method. There has been a few times including {(2/7/09) highest ovulation day} that he didn't pull out.      I had a yearly exam on 2/10/09, negative test. I took 2 HTP on 2/20/09 & 2/28/09 both negative.      My period is now 17 days late. I have so many symptoms; indigestion, high body temperature, bloating, nausea, white discharge, butterfly feeling in lower stomach, sensitive nipples, extremely tired and crazy mood swings not to mention very emotionally.       Also, when I was pregnant with my daughter, I had bleed for the {1st(Jan02)} and {2nd (Feb02)} month and did not find out I was pregnant until {March02} with a very very faint line, at that point they said I was about 12 weeks.      I was also reading on the internet that people usually conceive during the same time of year.      I'm not stressed...if I am pregnant, I am...but if I'm not pregnant, I'm not. Either way, i would like to know whats going on with my body and if I'm not why am not getting my period?       I just called the doctor and waiting on a return call to set up a blood test. But has anyone been through this and been pregnant or found out something else was wrong???

My mother and I have an on again off again type of relationship. We are not close at all. We go for months without talking until she comes up with some excuse to call me...grant it this time it was to tell me my uncle was sick...BUT she says the most horrible things and does not make any effort to see her grandchildren and she lives a BLOCK away. We had a huge falling out this weekend and I told her this time I am finally deciding to keep her out of my life for good, that I can't take the drama. I also advised her that she could not see my children, (keeping in mind she never cared to when she COULD)...she then tells me she will be taking me to court to evoke her grandparental rights?    Can she do this? We live in PA. By all means if she was any kind of grandmother I would never keep my children from her but she is a manipulative person who comes and goes out of your life as she pleases and I feel my children do not need that or her drama.

20090309113623AAgOsXA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do I help my best friend understand her child has problems and she needs to change?	My son is almost 5 and is very smart – he got lucky.  He can do addition, subtraction, write, etc. and he hasn't even started Kindergarten.  I understand that's not always the case, however...      Her son is almost 7 and in Kindergarten for the second time due to his maturity level and behavior issues.  He seems to be fairly smart but the condition of their home and her detachment from helping him mature and be ‘normal’ is a major cause of his problems.  He has been suspended from Kindergarten, sent home on countless occasions, has fought kids, tossed a desk, strangled a child, and refused to work or change activities.      As her friend and observing the problems, it’s painful for me to watch her believe that he is ‘normal’ and that all kids are like this.  He needs some psychological help or he needs some attention in an environment where he can get some one-on-one with a teacher.  Plus, her involvement with him needs to improve.      How on earth do I tell her this?  I don't want to hurt her feelings, I just want to help.  She is my closest friend for almost 7 years – since this child was 4 months old – and we are like family.  (But lately I don’t even want her son around mine because he’s so screwed up and has hurt my son.)

20090309102121AAlzQJG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Mother of 18 year old needs my help?	My Step-Mom has asked me for help with her oldest son. She plans to have a sit down with him and she needs to know what to say. I’ve given her some good points but she is so insecure about this and would appreciate more input. My Step-Mom is very stressed about this because apparently Chris has an extremely bad temper.      This summer Chris decided to start smoking and now that he's 18 (as of Friday) he's not afraid to display it. My Dad and my Step-Mom understand Chris has freedom of choice but they have a lot of concerns w/ this & they don’t want this habit around them, their children, their house or property.       The main problem is...there is still young, impressionable kids in this blended home. There are also young grandkids that frequently visit. (kids ages 2, 5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18)   One of the kids has respiratory issues, and another is literally allergic to cigarette smoke and went to the ER when younger.    Chris is very proud that he rolls his own smokes and leaves his big tobacco containers and filters in the open. So unattractive and so bad for kids.   Chris has also given himself permission to smoke in his brother’s car (16). That not only can be a $700 fine in our area (smoking with a minor in the car), it puts his brothers lungs at risk, and depreciates the value of this car that the brother has been working hard on.   My dad is paranoid that carelessly fling smoke could start a fire. My Step-Mom is tired of the disgusting butts flung on the lawn, and I’m tired of my puppy finding them & eating them (that could poison my pup)   I drove Chris home last night and he was so smoky I had to roll the window down (& I even have a husband that smokes) and it was freaking COLD out.      SOOOO Long story short – What more can we tell him and HOW so he doesn’t get violent.

20090309095214AAjO2Ds	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I induce, have an epidural or go natural with my next baby? I have very fast labours.?	I have a history of very fast labours, my first was born in 3 hours with an epi, my 2nd was born in 30 min all natural. (My husband missed the birth of our 2nd because he was parking the car) I live about 15-20 min away from the hospital. My doctor gave me the option of inducing this time but I hate the idea of "messing with nature" but then again, I don't want the baby born in the car, or for my husband to miss the birth. And then I can't decide if I want to do an epidural if they come so fast anyway, but I just remember the 2nd pregnancy being sooooo painful but almost like ripping of a bandaid (a hell of a band-aid)... really fast but really really painful, whereas my first was longer because I had to wait for the epi to wear off a little before pushing and it seemed to "drag it on" but at least it wasn't painful, I felt great. So now I don't know what to do??? Should I induce, should I bother with an epidural, or should I just tough it out and "rip off the band-aid" and do it natually? Or maybe just take a shot of whiskey with some extra strength advil when I go into labour (just kidding).      Help me out here! :)

I had to take my 8-month-old son this morning because he has been sick and I just felt terrible. He was clinging to me and I had to rip him off, force him to lay on the table, and let the doctor take over. There was nothing I could do. I just stepped back and watched. Ugghhh....rips my heart out. Please tell me I'm not alone here. I just don't know what to do when that happens? Nothing I say can soothe him. It's so sad.
20090309094524AALMVD6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Has anyone been through this with their 7mth old boy?  Should I be worried?	The only thing he can do is roll completely over.  He can't sit up, hold his own bottle, crawl, or anything else a 7 month old can do.  He eats well, he laughs (a lot, it's sooo cute), he does do pinwheels while on his tummy.  Like he'll just in circles to grab something.  Oh he does hold things and can grab things.  I know babies do things at their own pace but this just seems a little too late to not be doing alot.

20090309103841AAoS8pK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Question about 6 week old's bowels...?	My daughter is 6 weeks old this week.  She is a breastfed only baby and was recently diagnosed with reflux.  We have been giving her Zantac twice a day for about a week and a half now.  She started out with the normal yellow, seedy stools.  Then, it became brownish and very watery.  Now her stools have been green and a little seedy.  Is this normal?  She also seems to have explosive bowel movements.  I am a first time mother, and I am driving myself insane with all the research and reading I've been doing.  How normal is it for a baby's stools to constantly change?        Also, I don't eat a lot of dairy at all, cheese is about the most dairy I get in my diet.  My diet has been pretty bland since I've given birth, consisting mostly of sandwiches and salads as I do not have time to cook.  My daughter LOVES to be held 24/7!!  I do not believe anything in my diet is causing her gassiness, and my pediatrician says it is VERY rare for a child to be allergic to her mother's milk.  Has anyone else had a similar experience with their child's stools?  Thanks.

Now I am 9 weeks pregnant. I have NEVER made it this far in a pregnancy before. Both miscarriage were before 5 weeks. I went to the Dr and saw the heart beat, It was the most awesome thing to see. I think my heart skipped a few beats. I scared that I will lose the baby, the dr said that I have a 90% chance that everything will be ok. So that makes me happy but it will help put me at ease if some of you had similar experiences. Have any of you had more than one miscarriage and then went on to have a successful pregnancy.

Her cousins are a little rough when they play and make her cry all the time. Her 2-year-old cousin is always biting her, pushing her, spitting at her and she does not defend herself at all.

20090309094356AAHkOK6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it a Mom's job to contribute to visitation with a Father?	My boyfriend has a 3 1/2 year old with his ex wife. They are trying to work out their own custody arrangement without the courts but it isn't going so well. She denied letting my boyfriend see his daughter until she was 3. Then she played friendly for a while when she found out he had a baby boy with me and he was in his son's life but not his daughter's. The most recent arrangement was the mom was to drop the 3 1/2 yr old off Friday afternoon and the dad would then bring her back Saturday. When it came to do it however the Mom said it wasn't her job to drop her off and he should be responsible for all of that. She is a stay at home mom who still lives with HER parents and my boyfriend is responsible for 100% of the child's expenses via child support. Now he is back to not seeing his daughter again because it is play by the mom's rules or else. Should she be contributing to visits with the father by driving her their or is it solely his job? If it isn't her job to drop her off, what is her job?!?!?!?

20090309100104AAvc3iT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What would you call a guy like this?	Okay well I'm 6 months pregnant and I'm a single mother. The father of my son left when I was just 3 months pregnant, he said that he didn't love me no more and that he didn't nothing to do with me. Then two weeks after wards he started dating his NEW GIRLFRIEND shes 17 years old and she also has a baby from another guys.The way that my ex had been bothering me and just harassing me and making my life a living hell I decided to tell him to just leave me alone and to forget about the baby and me and he doesn't even know if its a boy or a girl and I think that's whats killing him inside that he doesn't know anything about the baby. Well he finally decided to leave me alone and stop writing me e-mails... well for a while then one day when I woke up and just checked my e-mail to see if my friend wrote me because we were suppose to go out to eat, then I saw that he had wrote me and that they were pictures and as soon as I clicked on them it was a picture of my ex with a tattoo of his new girls name on him and then the other one was a heart with his name on it i guess that they both got tattoos. When I saw this I started to feel lightheaded and I started to cry a lot and couldn't stop. I mean I haven't done anything to either of them so that they could send me some pictures that I obliviously didn't want to see. I honestly think that its wrong that he wanted to stress me out and the baby, my friend had called him to cuse him out to see what the hell was wrong with him and why is he bothering me with stupid pictures like that? He told her that he didn't send them to me that it was his girlfriend, then my friend told him okay if it was your girl then why the hell is she saying that she knows what armida (me) is going through and that she cares about the baby and her? He didn't say anything and he told her to tell me that he wasn't going to bother me anymore and that he was going to erase everything that he has about me. My friend told him that I called the police to get a protective order against him so that he could finally leave me alone and he told her to tell me not to do it, that it wasn't necessary. Then she called him again to tell him that i got the order and that if he wrote, called, or even came near me that he would get arrested and he just stayed quite for a while and then he said okay (beep) everything I don't want to know anything about her i will leave her alone. She also told him that his girlfriend was really stupid to do what she did. I feel that its my job to keep my son safe and I'm not goiin to let his father or his new girl stress out my lil one anymore because he's the one that suffers too not only me!

She has a daughter from a previous engagement and I've stepped in and assumed the roll as Dad perfectly. The only thing is, she wants another child now. We've got jobs lined up and are taking classes at the moment, we'll finish class within the next week. We plan on getting married in July-August and by that time we'll have those great paying jobs and will be financially stable. She would like to get pregnant now; I did the math and if she would get pregnant now, the baby would be here by January 2010. By that time we'd be married and financially stable and in place to provide for our children. What do you guys think? Positive feedback please??

Just wanted to share;      Two young boys walked into a pharmacy one day, picked out a box of tampons and proceeded to the checkout counter.     The man at the counter asked the older boy, "Son, how old are you?"     "Eight," the boy replied.    The man continued, "do you know what these are used for?"    The boy replied, "not exactly, but they aren't for me.  They're for him.  He's my brother.  He's four. We saw on TV that if you use these you would be able to swim and ride a bike.  Right now, he can't do either."

My son is a little over 6 months & has been sitting well for some time now. We've been using a small bowl, but I want to get a trainer seat for the big potty or a little potty for him so I can set him down because he is hurting my back. Someone gave us a little potty, but he doesn't seem to like it, I'm guessing because the seat is too hard. When did you start using a trainer potty or seat? Did/do you have a favorite? Thank you : )

I know the hospitals use the scan date.      I came unwell on 12th December. Approximately 14 days later was ovulation day (Boxing day) give or take a couple of hours of being fertile running up to the 26th December I make myself 12 weeks and 3 days. (Mon 9th March) However my scan said on Saturday that I was 13 weeks and 1 day a week in front of my dates.       Does this theory throw the TTC mummies right off track? Meaning you get pregnant before ovulation?      Thanks for your answer.

I woke up this morning at 5:54 AM because I felt like I was going to throw up and continued feeling like that even in the shower. I also threw up some lasagna a few days ago. I have period like cramping, but I don't feel like I'm going to get my period this month.  LMP was 2/2/2009. My period was supposed to arrive 3/1/2009 according to my calender I use on www.mymonthlycycles.com and it hasn't arrived yet.  Idk, I just feel totally different this month. I've also had a few headaches as well. Have had two false pregnancies; 1 at 19 and another at 20 years old. BFN 12/18/2006 @ 19, along with a pelvic exam which came back fine. BFN 10/20/2008 @ 21 years old.  22 now and TTC for 29 months & 29 periods.  Periods are every 28 days.  No smoking, no drinking, no illegal drugs or prescription medication.  Mom had no idea she was pregnant with me until I was born @ 24 weeks premature and no idea she was pregnant with my brother until she was 6 months pregnant.  According to mymonthlycycles.com I ovulated on the 16th of February but I'm not really sure when I ovulated to tell you the truth.

My 6 week old son recently (10 days ago) had to be put on hypoallergenic formula, because he has a milk protein allergy.  Since then, he has hard a very hard time having bowel movements.  He will push and strain trying to get it out, put he can't get it out.  His poop is the consistency of thick paste, and the only way we can get him to poop is to take vaseline on a q-tip and put it up his butt.  That works within a few minutes, is this something he will outgrow?  When he was on breast milk he went fine, but that's not an option.  Neither is switching him to a different formula because he's allergic to them.  Anybody else have this problem? He goes to the doc later this week and I will bring it up.  Just wanted to have other input.

20090309152027AAisZ4S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Sweeping the membranes, has anyone else had it done and did you go into labor?	I had to go to an appointment today, my 3rd in the last 2 days. I have been having my blood pressure monitored since it was high last week. The docs were determining if they wanted to induce me this week. Well in the last 3 visits its been GORGEOUS. I have had low pressure readings everytime. I am so happy, anyway... while I was there today the doctor said she was going to do a membrane sweep to help me along. I had never heard of it and never got one with my first. She says I am 3 CM dilated, and 65 to 70% effaced already and this could do it by helping release hormones. ANYWAY IT HURT like an SOB and I cried. OUCH. Now I am slightly cramping and had one minor contraction since I got home. Has anyone went into labor right away or a day or so after this procedure?

20090309114629AAchSMW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Adoption question....Looking for reassurance ?	This past weekend a girl I know very very well, actually lives with my parents gave birth to a baby girl. Which came as a complete and utter shock to all of us because NO ONE knew she was pregnant until she was in full blown labor..      Anyways, she has opted to put the baby up for adoption, which is probably the best option for the baby... SO this morning she relinquished her rights to an adoption agency here in California. I am just so heart broken for this perfectly healthy little baby girl. She has no one in the whole world to take her home and care for her, that tiny innocent baby is all alone... and being a mother I get really emotional about that. . The birth mother was not very smart and did not make arrangements before she gave birth.      So my question is... they say the baby will go into foster care for a few days before she can be placed with a family.... what is the likely hood that she will get adopted and be able to go to a loving family quickly? I have heard there are long waiting lists of parents ready to take a newborn.. is this true?      I dont like the thought of ANY child to be without parents but this one hit really close to home, you never think its gonna happen in your own home!

As far as babysitting gigs go, he's a real dream.      However, he likes to bring his own toys sometimes. I have no problems but he doesn't always like to share them. I started by saying that my boys have to ask before using his toys but then I started thinking that he's free to take our toys at will without asking. I'm worried that it's not fair for my children to have to ask, but not him.       What do you think about how I've handled this so far?   What would you do to make this fair?

They both go to a different school than me, (the same school) so I would only get to see them on the weekends.      Chris is my current boyfriend. He and I have dated for about two months. At first, everything was perfect in our relationship, but then things started to change. I started feeling really distant from him. We used to talk on the phone every night, and text all day. Now, we barely do. This has been going on for like 2 weeks now.      Then there's this other guy, Matt. I've been having feelings for him a lot lately. He's really sweet, but sort of out of my league. He's really flirty and showers me with plenty of attention. We have been texting constantly lately, and I've started to really fall for him.      I'm really confused about what to do. Should I start distancing myself more from Chris and then break up with him for Matt? Or do I let things keep going with Chris and see if things improve?

Well, I'm almost 30 weeks pregnant, and here for the past couple days... ive been having MAJOR lower back pain. And sometimes, it goes around front to my lower stomach and it starts to cramp up. It sucks sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad!! It started on Saturday... and then Saturday night i went and played darts (on a league)... i though it might be from the darts but it was hurting that day also. just it got worse after the night went on. maybe from sitting down and then getting back up so much while playing darts? im not sure.      what do you think? it got so bad yesterday, i was crying. but it hurts less, it seems like... when im walking. but yeah. it feels like so much pressure on my back, and it almost feels like its my tailbone, too. i wish i could pop my lower back but i just cant.      is ice ok to put on it? ive been putting an ice pack under my lower back and laying on it. that usually hits the right spots and somewhat relieves the pain a little. bc i roll the ice pack in a ball and lay on it firmly on my back. is that safe?      i just dont know what else to do. i have a doctors appt. on wednesday, and ill mention this to her. but anybody have any ideas on what i can do? or anything?      please help... :(      thanks!

20090309134318AAKHmgc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	My son's first mom told me that she had a baby girl 8 months ago. I need advice on ways to help and....?	Let me give you the background. I have a 2 year old son. We have a completely open adoption with his first mom. We see her on a regular basis, we talk on the phone all the time, etc... For 8 months she missed a lot of scheduled meetings. We moved about 10 hrs away when he was 1 year old. We saw her right before we moved. I thought she looked pregnant. Come to find out she had given birth three days prior to our meeting. We are going to visit her in a week. She finally tells me that my son has a full blooded sister who is 8 months old.       I am sad. What are some things we can do to help her. Sadly, she told me that my son's first father, once again wants nothing to do with this child. The first thing that crossed my mind was to move her down here, help her get her GED, babysit my son's sister while she works, etc... Me and my husband realized this is unrealistic and probably wouldn't be the best thing for our family or for her. We definitely don't want to muddy the waters on mothering. I don't want to overstep my boundaries. She's the mother, not me.       Is there anything we can do to help her? Can his sister visit us for maybe a week or two at a time so they can be together? Can we offer to help pay for her daycare? What can we do? Really the thing that os most important to me is that my son grows up knowing his sister. I may have to resolve myself that this is all I can do to help. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

20090309145009AAf833T	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Starting my own mommy and me class?	Okay so I live in an area where there isen't too much of anything.  The nearest "the little gym" or most mommy and me classes are at least an hour away.  Which is too much time travel with two children to do more than once a week.  So I started thinking, I would like to start my own "something".  The problem is, is I don't know what something I would like to start.  Perhaps like my own mommy and me class.  I have experience in preschool teaching, along with older children as well.  Currently I'm a stay at home mom, but am looking for a career that I can involve my kids in as well, even if I have to take classes for it.  Any suggestions would be great.  If you didn't have any "groups" or classes in your area, what would you like to see.  Thanks!

20090309145341AAknFQ1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Does it matter how long your cycle is when testing? Pleas read?	I have read that some of you ladies have tested as soon as 11dpo and got a positive result.. but most of you have shorter cycles like 28 or so days.   I have a 35 day cycle and I am currently in cycle day 22 and on cycle day 11- Thursday 26- I had EWCM. So I should be 11 days past ovulation today. My period should be due in about 13 days.   When can I test and it be accurate? or should be safe and wait until the day my period should come?

I find we both sleep better if she is on my chest listening to my heart beat. I don't move at night when I sleep so she doesn't get hurt. The thing is now, I'm constantly travelling between France and England and I feel as if it would be easier if she slept in a crib. The thing is my flat is way too small for a crib, my bed is in living room as I have a 3 room flat and it's tiny.      Would it be a good idea to put her into a cot now or not bother until I move completely to England?

20090309141541AA2FgB6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Spotted, but was in the wrong place at the wrong time...?	My fiance and i have been trying to conceive for a while, and on the 7th I believe I started spotting. There was a light pink, creamy discharge and I was very excited to say the least. My period is not due until the 15th and I am very regular, usually only a day or so off at the most.       Well the part I am asking about is see we were out at a park where we live on the 8th and my dear fiance got mistaken for someone else and attempted to jump him. (I know it sounds awful) Being who I am, i didn't even think about it I stepped in to try to help him, being it was 2 guys against him. I ended up getting kicked twice, at the same time. Once in the head, which is gong to look terrible when it bruises and the other in the stomach.didn't even notice getting kicked in the stomach until it was later pointed out there was a foot print on my stomach)      With in 1Min's of the event I had to go to the bathroom. And when I did, It was real thick and dark red. Last night i also had feelings that i was going to be sick to my stomach.       What im wondering is, not sure how to say this, did getting kicked basically knock the egg out if i was pregnant. also the bleeding is heavier then my period usually is.

I have written emails saying that she won't let me see him until there's a court order (however, without a court order i have every right she does) Im hoping this will show her colors in court, as well as the fact that her first child doesn't have court orders, nor does she let that father see his daughter. I've offered everything I can to let me see him, I've offered money, diapers, etc. I also have alot of evidence that shows how unstable she really is, and how crude and heartless.

20090309145540AAQ3pCO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I cought my son doing this.?	One day he had a few friends over. and he somehow got into an argument with one of his friends, so he pushed him. ( I was watching from the window), I didn't think that was a big deal, because they always play rough, but his friend got up, and he pushed him back, so my Son (age 7) punched him in the stomach, and made his friend cry.       I tried talking to him about his behavior, but all he says is " he starteed it", or " I didn't mean to, but he made me angry."       How do I make sure this doesn't happen anymore?I've tried to talk to him, I've tried to get him to speak to his friend, but he won't.      What do I do?

20090506231930AAAe4jU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Asked this earlier 2day. Plz read all, I need advice (serious)?	This is kind of a long story. 4 months ago my son came home from school w/ wet hair and we asked y. He's autistic and uses the bathroom on himself. The school normally had himself clean up and change clothes, but on this day the principal had him take his clothes off and shower. The principal watched. We pulled our son out of school. They threatened to file truancy so we contacted the state dept. of education and they put him on home hospital. But he only gets 2 hours a week, so we contacted the board to have him placed in a real school. They said they'd work on it but never called back. We've been dealing with this for 4 months. We had the principal investigated but hes still at the school. We kept calling the board to get him placed. Talked to every1 up to the assistant super attendant to no avail. We left msgs 4 the super attendant but never heard back. One lady from the board called another 1 (that we had a meeting with) and left a msg saying that she needed to talk to her about my husband be4 the meeting, but she dialed the wrong number and it wound up on our answering machine instead. The board is ignoring us and undermining our rights as parents at every turn. But we refused to back down! That apparently pissed them off, because 2day 2 cops showed up at my door with a summons 4 my husband. The school board is pressing chrgs 4 terroristic threatening class 2. (1-5 yrs in prison) My husband didnt do anything!!! He was at work when this was supposed to have happened. His boss heard the entire conversation, and said she'd testify it did'nt happen. But if the boards gotten away with this much whats to say they won't get away with having him locked up. Ive called every1 I know. I hate posting something like this, but im out of options. Plz if any1 can tell me how to people fight the board of education, I'll listen to any opinions! Exept for hiring an attorney, weve tried that, they need money up front and we dont have it. Any other suggestions would be appreciated. Also im not some person seeking attention like some on here, Im posting only as a last option, so plz no sarcasm or rudeness
20090309115850AAiqbiA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What can I do to make my infant feel better?	He just turned 6 months old today and he has his top front teeth breaking the skin, a really bad cold and he had shots today!  The poor guy is miserable.  Besides Motrin and plenty of fluids, what could I do to make him more comfortable and happy?
20090309120515AAkCMYF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What do I do if the baby's father doesn't believe it's his baby?	First of all I haven't slept with anyone else at ALL since I've been with him just to get that out of the way. This is not your typical baby daddy drama question so you don't have to give me any snide answers. My boyfriend think I cheated on him with this other guy he knows, which is ridiculous because I hardly leave the house. They're both black, but the other guy is light skinned and he's REALLY dark skinned. So what if he expects a fairly dark baby? I think he's thinking if it belonged to the 'other guy' [pfft..] that it will be light skinned.      Well anyway, It never happened, so I'm 110% positive the baby is his seeing how he's the only person I've been with in 2 years.. But what if the baby comes out light and he won't believe it's his? I know there's paternity tests but I'd hate for it to come to that.. It's not really easy to explain to him that the baby just could have taken a more dominant gene from me and came out lighter. It's also not easy to explain to him that when they're first born they aren't as dark as they might turn out to be. My friend's mom [who's black] had a baby and it looked pink when it came out just like any other baby.      I just don't want that to be the first thing he thinks when he sees the baby :[ Does anyone have any advice on what to do?
20090309120117AAaoRAd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it possible he will ever change?? Long but PLEASE help?	My partner of 4 years is a great guy, i do love him to bits and we have a beautiful little girl together.   Well as a lot of you know, things have been on my mind lately. I have questioning whether our relationship is worth fighting for.      He has a horrible temper and will say horrible things to me with no regard of my feelings at all. He has even hit me in the face numerous times. Then afterward he will be remorseful for his actions and i can tell he is completely sincere...   I just don't know what to think anymore...   I sometimes think i am a better person without him but i don't know how i will get on financially..i will lose everything.   The thing is apart from that he is pretty good...he is an amazing dad and i really don't want to let my daughter down by leaving him.       What do you think? Is it possible he will change? Am i really being manipulated? I am totally clueless right now...i have no idea what i am going to do so please help.      Please, no nasty comments, i cant do with them right now...And for those who go on saying i am young, naive...blah...DONT bother answering my question......please.   I just want the best for my daughter x
20090309114939AAyabF0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Can't make my mind up : ] Which name do you prefer?	Aideen or A?la?

Aideen (AY - dean) means 'little fire' in Gaelic, I'm Irish.   A?la (EYE-lah) means 'Noble' in arabic, father is Arab.   middle name may be Rose but I'm up for suggestions.   Just say which you prefer but if you have the time add some detail why you picked the name instead of the other?   Thanks x

20090309120511AADOqFG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about EXERCISE during pregnancy...?	So I was wondering how you know when enough is enough? Is it bad to have a "racing heart" when you are pregnant? I work on the 4th floor of my office building, but when I park in in the 2nd parking lot underground that means I walk up 5 long flights of stairs. And yes there is an elevator, but I always prefer using stairs, if its safe of course.       Anyway, prior to pregnancy I could walk up the stairs and be perfectly a-ok, now I just tried it (I am 29 weeks along) and I thought I was going to die. My heart was racing and I was breathing really hard. I know its good to exercise to an extent when being pregnant, but when I react that way do you think it is bad for me? Is it unsafe? Thank you for your input!

20090309115931AAjyh3o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	What to do... My baby always wants to be held or played with or else he will throw a fit and he is only 8 mont?	It's really starting to get tiering. I can never have a break. He doesn't want to sleep ever until hes balling his eyes out and so tired I have to rock him for days and give him his pacifier meanwhile hes wiggling around and throwing his arms around like a wrestler.Hes gone for a whole day with out a nap and then only slept 5 hours and then up wanting to play. He fights sleep .. he just wants to be entertained and play. We live with the in laws so it's hard to just let him cry with out someone giving me a hard time like im doing wrong and then picking him up saying"aw poor little baby you don't want to go to bed do you, your still up and ready to play.. your not ready for bed". It's annoying because I know when hes tired. Any advice. thanks.      hes totally turning into a needy needy baby thats a little spoiled. He wines when I take his arm away from my earrings because he pulled them out. he cries because he wants his food now and if I wait to long he grunts.I believe its due to everyone else trying to parent him and giving him his way. I put him to bed and someone comes and gets him out.If I have him a few days with out them being here I change his ways a little. Dont get me wrong he is a happy good boy but I'm starting to see some changes in his personality and I'm wanting to catch it quick.

20090309115950AAaxPXJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Kids Smoking + Kid with Athsma = Bad Situation?	I'm in grade eight. Every day as I'm walking to school there are people from my class, and the high school (the junior high and high school are in the same building) who are smoking. I get caught behind them and am forced to inhale all the chemicals they are putting into the air. I have athsma, not particularly bad, but still, I can't breathe after inhaling that, I can't stop coughing, and it gives me major headaches. I just walk by someone who smokes and intant headache, even when they aren't smoking. Switching schools is not an option. This is the only middle/high school in my small little town. What do I do?

20090309115917AA9cpVU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Should I or Shouldn't I?	I had my son when I was 16, the father was 17. The father didn't see him much his first year or life and hasn't seen him at all since he was about a year old. I have never sued him for child support b/c I was scared for my son to go visit him when he was that little. I'm now 26, my son is almost 10 years old. My husband who I've been with for 8 years and married to for 2 years has been my son's only father figure other than my father. But my son is starting to question things, wondering who his father is and stuff. He knows my husband is not his real father and he calls my Dad, his Dad but he knows it's just not so.       At this point should I let him meet him, is he too young still. The real father still parties a lot and has 3 younger kids with 3 different women,  he pays child support for 2 of them but says the mixed child is not his.   He tried to see him once when he was 7 and I wouldn't allow it b/c I didn't want my son in the kind of environment his real dad puts himself in, and my son had never asked me about him up to that point. So should I let my son meet him and maybe have day visits? Should I sue for child support , he pays for those other kids, why shouldn't he pay for mine after 10 years of not doing anything for him.      Confused???
20090309115923AAD5zgR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 2 year old son licks rocks...?	I thought that this was a behavior that was for kids younger than two. He grabs rocks about the size of this palm and licks them! I catch him every time, but he still does it.       Not just that, but he will put other things into his mouth. He'll put blocks, toy cars, coins and the rubber stopper that goes on the end of our safety bar to the back door.       Does anyone else's kid do this? I mean he's two, is this normal or hopefully a phase that will pass?
