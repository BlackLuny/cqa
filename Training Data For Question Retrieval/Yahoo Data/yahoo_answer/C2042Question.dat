20090202193551AAaHjsd	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Photos;Uploading Photos	I need a good image uploader.?	Okay, photobucket used to do this but they have updated it so it doesn't anymore. So I have a video that I want to upload but I don't want to upload it as a video, where you have to push play to view it. I want to upload it as an image where it repeats over and over by itself, almost like an animation or something. Photobucket used to allow you to do this, but about a year ago since they updated their bulk uploader, you can't. I've tried flikr, tinypic, and imageshack.       Help please? :[

When you hit submit to post your question, you see it when you go to where it shows all of them in a row....My main question is....   When you edit or add info to your question post, does it get thrown back to the top of that list or does it hold its position where ever that is?   Im wanting to know mainly because a lot of the time im responding to something that was posted on my post  and was wondering if possibly new eyes are seeing that when i edited or just from the original posting time..Its confusing, but hopefully someone catches on to what im saying...lol, its the best way i can explain it...Thanks in advance too!

20090202140527AAxTdL1	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Photos;Editing Photos	Can someone please edit this?	I believe that just as individuals have basic needs in order to function, grow, and develop, relationships are also essential for our individual growth and development. Family unit is very important whether your a child or an adult. It is the substance to how each one of us grow and interacts with each other. It strengthens bonds and trust. The family structure may differ for each and every individual. As we grow, we learn not just from our parents but from life experiences along the way. Re-enforcement of values and beliefs are what makes us who we are as individuals. I do believe that when we have support and confidence from family and friends that helps mold us into what we want and what we need as apart of society. It is never just one single thing that makes an individual who they are. It is those who have helped us and given us guidance and yes even at times taught us that choices have consequences and that is a learning existence as well.   Relationships play a central role throughout our lives. For example, whether our family structure is a mother, father, grandmother, or foster parent, it is important that individuals have loive, support, and guidance from others that can enhance our well-being. Strong support from relationships is good for individuals and is good for our well-being. Sometimes, when a family changes, so do we as individuals change as well.

First to solve it I will make you  BEST ANSWER!!!!! OOOOOO      Eight friends decided to try white- water rafting on a nearby river. They rented four two- person rafts: one was yellow, one was green, one was red, and one was blue. They selected partners for the four rafts and agreed on a destination at the end of a white- water run. Based on the following statements, one of which is false, what is the first name( Alan, Don, Frank, Henry, LeRoy, Paul, Phil, or Walt) and surname(Cook, Gladstone, Hawley, Hughes, O’Brien, Sands, Smith, or Wilson) of which each of the friends; which were partners on the four rafts; and what color raft was uses?      1.    Phil and Cook, who were in the same raft, arrived at the destination without incident, but they were not the ones who finished first.       2.     The red raft capsized and did not finish; the green raft was first to finish the white-water run.      3.    O’Brien and LeRoy were not on the same raft.   4.    Paul and Wilson finished last on their raft.      5.    Fortunately, Henry is a good swimmer, and he helped his partner, Hughes (whose first name is not Walt), get to shore. They were able to recover their capsized raft, but declined to finish the white-water run.      6.    Frank was the first to select a raft, and he picked the yellow one. He and Hawley were on the second raft to finish the white-water run.      7.   Alan and Hughes were on the same raft; they were the first to finish the white-water run.      8.   LeRoy and Smith completed the run and were not in last place.      9.   After their nearly tragic capsizing experience, Don and his partner, Gladstone, vowed not to set foot in another raft.      10. Alan did not care that he and his partner finished last; he was just glad that they made it.       GOOD LUCK!!!!
