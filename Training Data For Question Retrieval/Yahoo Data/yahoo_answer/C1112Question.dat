20090203101012AAseKRC	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Why do shops start selling summer shoes and sandalls at this time of the year when we really need boots?	Yes, I know I should have bought some at the beginning of the season (August perhaps) but hey, we want things in the shops to cater for the season we are in, not to have to think ahead by several months.       Maybe some really enterprising company will start a business called 'Seasons' and have four distinct areas which cater for each of the four seasons.  Not to be governed by what fashion dictates would make shops and suppliers realise that their takings reflect just what is selling and in which season.  It would not be a shock to us, the consumer, that strappy dresses and sandals are not selling in the winter but that warm clothing and appropriate footware are raking in a profit.         I know all about stocking up with new season's fashions and colours and going with manufacturers and fashion houses.  However, that could still follow as long as the consumer can buy what they need when they need it and not be tearing out their hair in frustration because 'there's no call for them when the summer stock arrives and we need the floor space' kind of talk.        Having trecked round our local shopping centre to find boots that are (a) available (b) practical ie not high heel death defying contraptions (c) comfortable (d) not costing excess of ￡90 and (e) in my size, UK size 4, I thought that I was in the minority.  But I met loads of  shoppers asking the same questions in the same shops and we were all told 'sorry, wrong time of the year for boots' when a glance out of the window would prove otherwise.      Oooh, don't get me started!!!

20090219195639AAQK5gg	Beauty & Style;Hair	Do you ever get use to long hair?	I have long hair, somewhat anyway, but it's heavily layered and I would say my longest length is close to the middle of my back, past my shoulders, but I'm short in build so that's long hair for me. But to have the length all the way past your shoulders that passes your chest, close to your stomach...that's pretty long hair, right?      I get my haircut every six weeks, but I am trying to up it to about ten weeks because I hardly have, if any, split ends by the time the next six weeks arrives, but I always seem to stop at a certain length in my hair and can't get past it. Either because I get frustrated with the length and having to deal with it after every show and it takes me longer than usual to tame it. I also realize having longer hair sort of weighs your hair down....      I want to get past the comfort zone and want my hair to grow, but that thing is....do you ever get use to it? I use to have long hair when I was a little girl, and once when I was 14-15 years old. I want long hair again, but....grrr! I want it to grow but it gets in my way...      Any suggestions, or just tell me to shut up and stop wasting your time! LOL. Sorry. I'm blabbering.

But, it seems the same to me?so does anybody know any other homemade scrub, maybe like oatmeal and sugar together?would that work?thankx:)            some tips i tried:   *use vaseline lip therapy(99 cents at walmart!), put it on then rub your lips lightly with a toothbrush,LIGHTLY, do it every night or every other night. Also leave vaseline overnight and you'll wake up with moisturized lips      *for those of you that's planning to put eggs on your hair(the whole egg), DONT DO IT. maybe the egg yolk would work but i didn't try it yet;).      *for soft and lighter skin, mix egg white with lemon, (i put the same amount), then mix with a fork until it gets bubbly or until the egg white is completely mixed with the lemon. Apply on face. Then wash after 10-15 minutes, or more if you want. Wash out with cold water to close the pores. do this 2-3 times a week, don't do it 2 much cause if you do, it will have less effect each time.      *don't wash your hair every single day, it will take out vitamins or important oils from your hair. At least shower every other day, you could do it 2 times a week but i do it every other day.      *hair products:Silk Drops Hair Serum, and Tresemme Heat Tamer or V05 Heat Protection (both for heat protection, V05 is cheaper, but i use tresemme now), Suave or Tresemme Hairspray.      alright, good luck and please answer thee question:)

20090219210515AAzMsFS	Beauty & Style;Hair	Argh! I cannot decide! Long or short?	My best friend is telling me to get it short. She says it makes me look older, and "sexier," instead of just "cute." She also is making the argument that when I have it longer I usually only straighten it when I'm going out otherwise its thrown up in a bun/ponytail. With shorter hair I'm forced to style it more.    My husband says eithers fine, but he thinks longer is the "sexier" option.   I just had  a baby so I've felt quite unsexy for the past few months. So I want a hairstyle that's SEXY!

20090219190640AAhkBYn	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Is it possible to get my dress altered?	So I have never really gone dress shopping before...I've only had several occasions in my life where I had to wear an evening dress.  When it came to buying my grad dress online, I wasn't sure what size to go with.  I did try looking elsewhere, but found nothing to suit my taste.  I settled with this:       http://www.bluefly.com/Carmen-Marc-Valvo...       Not too over-the-top fancy, nice lines, beautiful color..it's even more stunning when you actually see it in front of you.      It arrived today and needless to say it is too big.  It's not too severe, but around the chest area, it is somewhat loose...what I'm worried about is the waist area.  Right now it fits absolutely fine, but I plan on losing weight in the next 3 months.  Sounds superficial, but I've had enough of an inconsistently unhealthy lifestyle.  I'm not ridiculously overweight, but I'm 5'4 and almost 130lbs.  I naturally have a small build, and this excess weight is not flattering.  I ordered an 8.  Bad decision.  Although it's not that extreme, I am assuming that I will need to take in the waist area.  But because of the beading work, would it be possible??

20090219182902AAiR5Hx	Beauty & Style;Hair	Female opinion on dreadlocks?	K so I'm thinking of growing dreads but I want some female opinions before I jump into it.    I know a lot of people think dreads are dirty and you need to put food and **** into your hair to make them, but that's totally NOT TRUE. I promise. People with dreads still wash their hair regularly, and you don't need to put **** in it. The only reason it looks dirty is because it gets naturally more knotted and tangled so it's messier, but still as clean. I'm planning on taking really good care of my dreads and keeping them really really clean.   Just so u kinda know what my hair looks like, I have very dark brown hair (almost black) that goes down past my shoulders, so it'd probably reach just under my chin when its dreaded.      I get that some girls just don't like dreads, so if you really think it's a bad idea, please please tell me WHY. I'm really looking for either approval or constructive criticism, so thanks in advance!

20090219201809AAssWxi	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	A question?? I love whoever answers ahah?	So... if you liked this girl almost allll of the last school year, and knew she liked you back, but you both were in seventh grade and decided not to go out. So yeah you still flirted and talked and it was cute but you didn't really text her because you always lost your phone and just weren't really a texter in general, not that it mattered because you guys talked at school. You keep on liking her until school ends.      So then the summer goes by, you don't talk to her once. School's back, you have no classes together... you see her frequently in the halls but never talk. Then, one day, out of the blue she goes up and talks to you for a bit you SMILE AND ITS HELLA CUTE <3 while you're the type of guy who has hardly any friends who are girls and who hardly ever smiles... you give her this BIG HEARTMELTING SMILE. :] After this, you change your bike path so you're on the same as hers. A week goes by, and you don't talk, until the last school day you have before valentines day, she gives you a valentine. No biggie, she gave them to a lot of her friends but since you hadn't talked in a while it was a little unexpected. About five days later, over break, she texts you and you actually reply... she gets 21 messages from you in a 24 hour period, you get 19 from her. Now break's over, and you've been at school one day, she hasn't talked to you but it's only been one day.      1) if you were in this situation, would it be possible that you still liked her? (cuase i still like him but I didn't realize it until I spoke to him)   2) Would you think she liked you back? You're not what you would call a ladies man... you've never had a gf, and you aren't popular with the girls lol. Just cuz ur rude ;] (but you've always been so sweet to me! well almost always)   3) WHAT SHOULD I DO TO GET HIM TO LIKE ME?? Tomorrow is 8th graders open gym day were the 8th graders can go play b-ball... and I have to take pictures... I'm 100% sure he'll be there. Any suggestions? I already know what I'm wearing, lol. ALSO... I want to be able to talk to him in the halls more, at least say hi. How, and what do I say?

I've been using neutrogena advanced solutions and recently started neutrogena daily scrub oil free wash. I seemed to have minimized some of the zits but i still can't keep up with breakouts. I'm a swimmer so I also need lots of face lotion seeing as the chlorine dries out my skin 7 days a week. I get the breakouts on my forehead, cheeks, nose, under my nose, and on my chin.
