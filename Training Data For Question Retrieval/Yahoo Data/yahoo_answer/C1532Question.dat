20090225101215AA9RPqX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I Believe I have a Gift.. I have Magical Powers.. Serious Answers Only!?	I am certain that I have magical powers, the reason I am saying this on the interwebs is because I will remain anonymous, i am worried that if my family and friends find out about this they will exploit me, my magical powers, and my money.  I realized I had magical powers about 3 months ago, and so far my magical powers include but are not limited to:  I can move things with my eyes (for example, I am not typing right now, my eyes are typings this question for me), I can time travel, yesterday I went back to my childhood and attended my 5th birthday party at skate ranch. I also have super human strength, i also just discovered i can make myself invisible (i know this is hard to believe, but my body takes on a clear gelatine form). I can also stop time and I have xray vision.  As difficult as it is to keep this a secret, I really enjoy my magical powers, and I would like to keep them as long as possible which is why i dont want to leak who i really am because I am very fearful. Any suggestions or helpful advice?

20090227112905AAb2xPL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you agree there has to be a God?	I personally believe it is impossible for there to be no God. It is not just improbable, it is literally impossible because the fact is everything requires a creator.      I've seen some people describe the question of whether or not there is a God like this:      There was a force behind the Big Bang. Atheists believe what caused the Big Bang had no conscience and was simply a force of nature. Theists believe the force had to have a conscience.      That is an interesting way to describe it, but I'm not sure if I would phrase it that way, but I do agree that the force behind the universe absolutely does have to have a conscience.       It has to be planned. Just look around.      Do you agree?

20090227112707AA6VDgW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	When did human DNA and genes degenerate to where incest lead to harmful defects in the offspring?	I'm just wondering because I keep hearing that Adam and Eve (And Noah and his posse) were allowed to do incest to populate the Earth because genes weren't corrupted (or some such) back then. So when in the 6000 (or so) years of human existence did our genes degenerate to where we could no longer have incest without harmful affects to the children?

20090227112656AAUQ6jP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can an Atheist give me proof that God does not exist?	Proof: evidence sufficient to establish a thing as true, or to produce belief in its truth.   If an Atheist can give me "evidence sufficient" I will join you      Let me start with a few beliefs of mine   1. Religion and Science can not prove everything they do not have all the answers   2. Religion and Science belong hand in hand one can not prove the other wrong with out answering the other      So with that here are my questions.   First if we developed from a primordial soup why are the odds so high that for life to develop is 1 out 3.9x10 to the 372 power that means I have a better chance of winning the multi-state lottery, dating a supermodel, getting hit by a lighting bolt, being an olympic medalist win an academy award and gett a royal flush (what a life) before I could create life in a soup      second question if we are inter animal evolving why aren't more monkeys talking?      third where does consciousness come from, don't give me chemical reactions because My consciousness is different from yours? if we all have the same chemical reactions we should think and be the same.       fourth tell me what love is?      Prove me wrong
20090227113120AAvJluM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fellow Atheists: What's your take on the comical humor pointed at the religious on Family Guy?	God owns a rifle and wants to shoot Meg.

But there's so many shows now-days actually making fun of religious people. What's your stance on this subject?      I think it's just funny and anyone who thinks it's "degrading" or "sacrilegious" is just whining.

Will there be a huge difference between the people who thought that Mary was holy and those who believed she was a normal human? Will those who didn’t eat meat on certain days be happier than those who did?

Don't you think it is because  of the fall of legalism Christianity?       For instance about 6 days ago  there was a discussion on " keeping Short account with God" on R&S board, I admit that I have completely being turned off by the post as well as by some of the answers were given to the post, then a thought Cross my mind to read Richard Dawkins's book.       My point is if I ( some one who has been introduced to the gospel of grace)  gets turned off by legalism propaganda  to the point of getting tempted to read Richard Dawkin's book, How much legalism teachings & propagandas are affecting unbelievers?      I do believe this is  one of the reasons our Christianity has  become unattractive to the common persons.        The truth is Christianity by it is very nature IT is VERY  attractive, ( check the book of acts)     attracts Sinners, tax-collectos, Prostitutes etc. Your thougts?      Please answer respectfully. Thanks.
20090227114322AAc4XCM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Believers: why is your version of a god better than other gods to fill the gaps in your knowledge?	This is something I truly don't understand, so please enlighten me.      Stuff like this gets posted at least 20 times an hour in this section: "Explain to me where love came from, and morals and consciousness. If you can't explain how the entire universe came into existence, then my particular version of a god must have done it"      I paraphrase, of course. But it really sounds a lot like "I don't get it, so my God is true"      Please explain it like I'm really, really stupid: Why are the gaps in your knowledge better filled by your own version of a god instead of any other version of a god? How is it any different than saying "I don't get it, so Buzz Lightyear did it" ?

20090227114236AAEfJkC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jews, if the Bible says that the Messiah would be called LORD, how is it wrong to worship Jesus?	As in, the Hebrew Bible says:      Jeremiah 23:5-6      5 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous shoot, and he shall reign as king and prosper, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.   6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The LORD is our righteousness.         It's right there, your own bible says that a man would become called LORD, meaning God.       So why not believe?
20090227115936AAumIPM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, and I guess Jews, how do you explain the exact dates of the death of the Messiah and Jerusalem?	(Daniel 9:24-26)       "Seventy sevens are decreed for your people and the Holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most Holy. Know and understand this; from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One (Messiah), the Ruler comes, there will be Seven sevens and Sixty-two sevens. After the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be cut off and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed. "          So basically, this proves to Jews also, that the Messiah HAD to come before the destruction of the second Temple in 70AD. Proves it, no doubt.       So how do you explain the EXACT prophecy of the Messiah coming and dying and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem like 700 years before it even happened??

But, it's horrible to me to pass on traditions that teach people to feel guilty for enjoying a beer or a beefsteak. They even lose the ability to perceive their own guilt in the long run, and end up feeling like everything is alright...

I recently came to the conclusion that God acts in our lives in a varieties of ways (what we encounter, what we read, and so on). However, if God is within you, it means he is in other people as well, acting through them.      My question is, how can one recognize when a loved ones' words or gestures are coming from God, and how to keep faith when they disappoint you, or act in a mean way towards you?, what does that mean?

20090227124314AAwaK5F	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Should Women's Rights Organizations (N.O.W.), start fighting for father's rights?	Court Holds That Same-Sex Partner Lacks Standing to Seek Child Custody    http://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_n...       There's a growing amount of divorce cases involving custody between married female partners, where the mother of the children claim her former partner does not have any rights to the child.  This is very similar to what fathers have fought for over the lat 30+ years.  Even if granted visitation rights, the mother can still violate her former partner's right by simply refusing to obey the orders.  Mothers, for the most part, are never punished in any way for violating these orders.  According to a U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services study, "Survey of Absentee Parents" a minimum of 60% of these orders are violated by the mother.      So, in order to fight for the protection of parental rights for non-custodial women formerly married to women, should Women's Rights Organizations (N.O.W.), start fighting for non-custodial father's rights?

Really, why should it be important. We are here now, just live for today. Believers of God, if you know God is truly there, and you know He loves you, why does it matter how He created you? Atheists, if you feel very confident about evolution, why do you spend a lot of time trying to prove it to people that won't listen? Really, I know a lot of people care, but why?
20090227122211AAzP5IA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Was the earth created by a Person or evolved from a thing?	Christians believe God is a Spiritual Person that created the universe. They believe they are able to converse with this Person.       Evolutionist believe the universe was created by a thing that exploded with a big bang. They cannot converse with a thing.      Since we cannot converse with a thing we cannot ask it questions.      However, you can ask God questions and one question to finalize the debate if God is real or not is simply ask Him that if He really exist to reveal Himself to you. If He does not answer you, you have nothing to be concerned with on judgment day.
20090227125920AAEhHmD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What does the Bible say that Really helps us to understand what the soul is?	N/A
20090227125746AASwNXp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Bible usage shows the soul to be a person or an animal or the life that a person or an animal enjoys?	To many persons, however, “soul” means the immaterial or spirit part of a human being that survives the death of the physical body. Others understand it to be the principle of life. But these latter views are not Bible teachings.    Since God’s servants have the hope of a resurrection in the event of death, they have the hope of living again as “souls,” or living creatures. For that reason Jesus could say that “whoever loses his soul [his life as a creature] for the sake of me and the good news will save it. Really, of what benefit is it for a man to gain the whole world and to forfeit his soul? What, really, would a man give in exchange for his soul?” (Mr 8:35-37) Similarly, he stated: “He that is fond of his soul destroys it, but he that hates his soul in this world will safeguard it for everlasting life.” (Joh 12:25) These texts, and others like them, show the correct understanding of Jesus’ words at Matthew 10:28: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” While men can kill the body, they cannot kill the person for all time, inasmuch as he lives in God’s purpose (or Memory) (  (compare Lu 20:37,?38) and God can and will restore such faithful one to life as a creature by means of a resurrection.       For God’s servants, the loss of their “soul,” or life as a creature,  it  is only temporary, not permanent.        What have you been taught?

20090227121430AA3vg0l	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How is this honestly considered judging?	saying: you're a sinner and we're all sinners is NOT judging.      saying: YOU'RE A STUPID IDIOT AND YOU DISGUST ME WITH YOUR LIFESTYLE, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE THAT WAY   is judging.      The first is trying to alert the person of their faults to help them      the second is just putting the person down.      apparently no one wants to hear about their own faults from anyone ever, they can just live in fantasy land, believing they are perfect....      It's like if you wanted to eat nothing but snack food (donuts, chocolate, candy) for the rest of your life, and I told you that you were going to be unhealthy and probably die earlier, that is considered judging??? Let's get real here.      Again there is also a difference from casting the first stone, and alerting someone of their faults to help them. Too many people are on the defensive.

I have used the KJV and Young's Literal Translation.      YLT:      Deuteronomy 23:17      17There is not a whore among the daughters of Israel, nor is there a whoremonger among the sons of Israel;       1 Kings 14:24       24and also a whoremonger hath been in the land; they have done according to all the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel.       1 Kings 22:46      46And the remnant of the whoremongers who were left in the days of Asa his father he took away out of the land;       2 Kings 23:7      7And he breaketh down the houses of the whoremongers that [are] in the house of Jehovah, where the women are weaving houses for the shrine.       KJV:      Deuteronomy 23:17      17There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.      1 Kings 14:24       24And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.      1 Kings 15:12       12And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.      1 Kings 22:46       46And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.      2 Kings 23:7       7And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.      whoremonger (plural whoremongers)         1. A frequent customer of whores.      2. A procurer of whores; a pimp.      sodomite (plural sodomites)         1. One who practices sodomy; a sodomist.      2. (derogatory) A male homosexual.      Which one is correct?

20090227130412AAM8FDr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, If Jesus did not come to condemn the world, than why are people being threatened with condemnation?	I use to work with drug addicts and alcoholics, and one of the hardest thing I ever had to do, was put someone out of the program because they went back to using.    And these guys, I have given them many of breaks before letting them know they had to go.    I would try to find a hospital or a rehab clinic that would work with these guys. But I would never ever leave them without trying to help.       We all have a addiction, whether it be drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, sex, homosexuality, gambling, lying, adultery, stealing, one who is always being sarcasm, or even pornography. It's an addiction (sin) that we should not be so fast to judge and condemn people for.           It's so easy to tell someone, hey if you don't repent you are going to hell for your sins. But let's be honest, Jesus never said that. Like he told the man he told at the well to pick up your bed and walk, than later when he saw the man, he said Go and sin no more or something worse may happen. But he never told the man that he was going to hell if he continue to sin.       The only time Jesus actually talked about hell in the way of people, was when he was asking a question.     Matthew 23:33   Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?   In the twelve years that I have been out here with the people. I have never threaten anyone about going to hell. I guess because with me, I did some dirt in my life time that I thank God I had changed from. But it took time for me to change and it didn't happen over night. So I know if it took time for me to change, It will take time for others to change as well. If we really want that change, we will change, but it does take time. God knows if someone wants to change or not. You may fool people, but we can't fool God at all.       Yes people need to know about hell, but not in a way to say, this is where you will be going if you don't do this and if you don't that NOW.       And the one thing that Jesus never did was call everyone a sinner. He saw two side of the coin. Not just one. I believe if Jesus would have called the people he came for sinners and threaten them with hell's fire if they didn't repent, they would have never followed him. I know I wouldn't have.

20090227131231AAYgO5m	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why does the Hebrew/Christian/Muslim god allow other gods to exist?	Exodus 31:14 Do not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous god.      Exodus 20:3 (The first commandment): You shall have no gods before me.       Exodus 23:24-25 Do not bow down before their gods or worship them or follow their practices. You must demolish them and break their sacred stones to pieces. Worship the LORD your god...       God (Yahweh) doesn't deny the existence of other gods, it merely tells men not to follow other gods.  How can this be?  How could the one "true" god recognized other gods as existing?  If it is the one "true" god then no other gods should exist, but according to the old testament, this is not the case.  Does that make sense to anyone?
20090227133211AAwHCs8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can you say to summon something is wrong when you do the same thing?	I hear a lot of Christians say that summoning a Spirit, being, body, is wrong and is considered "linked to the devil". But wait for a second and think. When you are preying, and concentrating so hard on the "Spirit of the holy ghost" and you ask it to enter you, and cleanse you. Is that not a form of summoning? You are asking a spirit to be with you or enter you. Now granted you are "claiming" its the holy ghost, but how can you be certain that you, yourself have not opened a realm to which you invited an evil being? So how can you say to summon something is wrong, when you yourself is guilty of the same thing?
20090227133132AA8nJSu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, ladies and gentlemen: What would you say was the ‘main’ purpose of miracles?	The raising of Lazarus from the dead being the most notable, but of course as Christians you will know there were many more such miracles. This same purpose is also seen in apostolic healings. Peter explained the healing of the lame man at the temple gate called ‘Beautiful’ in the following way:   When Peter saw the people’s wonder and amazement over the miracle that had just taken place, he said to them:    “Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk?” Acts: 3.12.   What then is the main purpose of healing?
20090227131044AAqV942	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Popular culture sending people to hell?	does the culture fostered in mainstream society (tv, music, schools, etc) direct people to live ungodly lives and lead them to follow the path of destruction unknowingly?      Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction, and those who enter through it are many.    How narrow the gate and constricted the road that leads to life. And those who find it are few.    -matthew 7 13-14

20090227131949AAXQdKz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do other scholars who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses acknowledge that this is what the Bible says the soul is?	“There is no dichotomy [division] of body and soul in the O[ld] T[estament]. The Israelite saw things concretely, in their totality, and thus he considered men as persons and not as composites. The term nepe? [ne′phesh], though translated by our word soul, never means soul as distinct from the body or the individual person. .?.?. The term [psy?khe′] is the N[ew] T[estament] word corresponding with nepe?. It can mean the principle of life, life itself, or the living being.”—New Catholic Encyclopedia (1967), Vol. XIII,?pp.?449, 450.      “The Hebrew term for ‘soul’ (nefesh, that which breathes) was used by Moses .?.?.?, signifying an ‘animated being’ and applicable equally to nonhuman beings. .?.?. New Testament usage of psychē (‘soul’) was comparable to nefesh.”—The New Encyclop?dia Britannica (1976), Macrop?dia, Vol. 15, p. 152.      “The belief that the soul continues its existence after the dissolution of the body is a matter of philosophical or theological speculation rather than of simple faith, and is accordingly nowhere expressly taught in Holy Scripture.”—The Jewish Encyclopedia (1910), Vol. VI, p. 564.      God is saying you will positively die.      Who is it saying to us:  YOU positively will not die.

Is it possible that heaven is in the core of the earth?    Matthew 12:40- For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be the three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. And then it has in parenthesis in the book I'm reading "Hades has two sides-- one side was paradise one side was torment).      The paradise comment makes me think heaven is the other side? But then again ALL of the center of the earth is a lake of fire, so why would it be heaven? I'm confused, what do you think?      Thanks for the help(:

20090227134451AA9K0Df	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Who was King David's successor mentioned at Isaiah 9:6-7, Solomon or the Messiah?	When reading Isaiah 9:6-7 aren't these verses speaking of Solomon and not the Messiah?      Christians believe these verses are a prophecy about the Messiah. Verse 6 in particular supports the Trinity belief with the words "Mighty God" "Eternal Father" but these words were clearly added since Isaiah 9:7 says: "His royal power will continue to grow; his kingdom will always be at peace. He will rule as King David's successor basing his power on right and justice."      When King Solomon ruled God's people he judged the people fairly and there were no wars, the Israelites lived in peace. Also everyone knows that King Solomon succeeded King David to the throne. Isaiah must have been alive at the time of King Solomon since prophets do not prophesy about the past.      I asked a similar question last week but some person or persons had it removed. Could the fear of Christianity's false prophecy coming to light be so great a threat?

20090227140915AACCsXC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What color are angels? What shape?	Usually they are depicted as white, but then Lucifer is himself the Angel of Light, so heavenly angels would, in theory, have to be different.      Along the same lines, anything that is white by its very nature reflects all colors equally, so as far as electromagnetic radiation is concerned, white is physically repulsive.      Personally, I think heavenly angels must therefore be black, as black accepts and absorbs all colors of light, just as God himself accepts all sinners once they repent and accept Jesus.      Furthermore, I suspect true angels must be spherical, as the sphere is the only truly perfect three dimensional form, with no angles, only one surface, and perfect symmetry along all axes.      Any thoughts?

20090227161822AAYkVwa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for people of all faiths and religions?	How will you get forgiveness of your sins? Can you really earn forgiveness or does it have to be given? If i choose to forgive someone is that not my decision and not earned by anything they have done? So if you are trying to earn forgiveness from God is this not like trying to bribe a judge of law? If i go to court as a person that murdered someone can i just ask the judge to forgive me because of everything i have done good since? Will He not say that does not change the fact that your murdered some and a price has to be paid or a punishment has to be given. Who is going to pay that price or punishment for your sin? If you do not think you have sinned then are you perfect? Remember no one is good except God.

20090227161020AAJHhsp	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Im worried, living a destructive life.....?Will my best friend be alright?	Ok were 16. Its a real long story but il make it short. We hang around with a large group of people, were from a rich area, were popular and good looking. (If it annoys you that I say this openly dont answer). Anyway its not like any of us are drugies but we would drink every friday and saturday and most nights on holidays. Both of us have always been a little strange and we both have gone through alot, I lost my mom two years ago and have been on a downwards spiral ever since, it keeps getting worse and worse, my home life is horrible and I can never take pleasure in anything good. My best friend has been through alot, she's like a sister to me and probably isnt the most sane, Divorce, SEIRIOUSLY messed up family life, like you would not believe to what extent, rape everything.. Anyway she was in a sort of destructive relationship it ended she was destraught, at a house party I had she got a razor and cut her wrists and everybody found out and blancked her for ages, everybody thought she was mental. Thats ok now. But she told me she was pregnant and she only told me and her ex boyfriend and another friend. She starved herself , drank to excess and took the pill everyday untill she had a miscarrige. She was withdrawn. She never would talk to me about it. Tonight all of us were over at a friends house watching a movie and everybody started talking about this girl in my year who is pregnant and saying how sorry they felt for her and how she was an idiot to keep it and all. My friend started shaking but she controlled herself. Im real worried about her, what do I do? If it got out id say she would be kicked out of her house. I think this is really going to mess with her mind and could this affect with her fertility in later life?

20090227155210AArK0Ut	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Quest. For our noble respected sisters (and brothers)?	Perhaps some sisters and brothers can respond to the following ayaat and      1- provide some tafseer from various tafseers (with sources mentioned)   2- what the scholars have said regarding these ayaat   3- what are some of the benefits - practical benefits- that we can derive from the wisdom in these verses based upon the tafseers to use in this modern age.      Jazaak allahu khayran wassalaamu alaykum..      Oh and the ayaat are from surah 33. Surah Al-Ahzab (The Confederates)      28. O Prophet (Muhammad )! Say to your wives: If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, Then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner (divorce).      29. But if you desire Allah and His Messenger, and the home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allah has prepared for Al-Muhsinat (good-doers) amongst you an enormous reward.      30. O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you commits an open illegal sexual intercourse, the torment for her will be doubled, and that is ever easy for Allah.      31. And whosoever of you is obedient to Allah and His Messenger  , and does righteous good deeds, We shall give her, her reward twice over, and We have prepared for her Rizqan Karima (a noble provision Paradise).      32. O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery, etc.) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner.      33. And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and sins, etc.) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet ), and to purify you with a thorough purification.      34. And remember (O you the members of the Prophet's family, the Graces of your Lord), that which is recited in your houses of the Verses of Allah and Al-Hikmah (i.e. Prophet's Sunnah legal ways, etc. so give your thanks to Allah and glorify His Praises for this Qur'an and the Sunnah). Verily, Allah is Ever Most Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things.

20090227155548AAubRQ7	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you agree with me that all marijuana users are evil?	I believe so. Anyone who doesn't think they're evil is probably a pot smoker themself. Pot smokers are pure evil because they don't have any respect for the law or their own health. They don't care that they're giving themselves lung cancer and brain damage, they just care about the dumb high it gives them. Sure, you can't OD on pot, but you can't on cigarettes either and both of those kill you in the same way-- over a long period of time. They are destroying the very fabric of American culture and society. I can't turn on the TV or read a newspaper without seeing or hearing some dumb-**** stoner saying that weed should be legal. America has enough problems trying to do away with stoners whilst pot is illegal; if it was legalized, the cops can't touch them and they will spread their disgusting, pointless, and deadly vice to others, turning them into unproductive and unmotivated slackers who spend the rest of their lives sitting around eating their weight in junk food and watching crap TV. Meanwhile, tumors will form in their lungs and brain cells will die, but they won't notice or care because they'll think it's worth it for their stupid high.       I can safely say that I speak for all non-stoners when I say that pot and pot smokers should be done away with and punished as severely as possible. Any non-stoner that disagrees with me is probably just waiting for it to be legal to take up the habit.

You know what I mean - the end of his Benediction Prayer when he asked God to help 'whites embrace what is right'   As a white person, I found this a very offensive, divisive and inappropriate thing to say at the Inauguration of a BLACK president. Hello!   It seems that this country has been bending over backwards for minorities for quite a long time now. Affirmative Action would be a perfect example of this, and there are quite a few others. When will it be enough for them? Why do we feel that we must all go around kissing their asses like this and trying to perpetually make amends for something like slavery which occured in the 19th century, and which no one alive in this country right now had anything to do with?

A) Science goes by experimentation. Where is the experiment in the evolution theory?      If scientists are not capable of conducting such an experiment through research, then believing in it becomes a mere faith, not something very different than religion.      If no experiment, then at least a mathematical truth, as there are no lies in mathematics. Is there a mathematical confirmation?      I neither accept it nor reject it.   I'm not a scientist to decide to take a certain side or another, otherwise it will be just for the sake of my own personal beliefs. Scientists are not in agreement, then I am also intermediate.

We've known each other for around 5 months now and I thought he was cute when I first saw him. He is really, really shy so shy he doesn't even come up to me in real life at school and he turns red when he talks but on msn it's a completely different story.      Anyways, as time progresses, I started liking him and we talk alot online but he's too shy in person.      And online he likes to make weird jokes like.   Me : "What are you doing tonight?"   Him: "You!"      And it confuses me because he likes this girl that doesn't like him back and the day she rejected him, and that day I was talking to her about how I liked him but I didn't want to anymore, he was fully cut and upset when she rejected him and he thought the talk i had with her influenced her to reject him, and then I was about to tell him that I liked him but then he asked me to the movies. This is so confusing.      And nothing happened at the movies, it was just us alone in the cinema and the movie which was 'He's just that into you' had so many hints and stuff.      Is he gay or what?   I try my hardest to hold it in because I have asked him before but he replied with random things.   Like   Me :"are you gay?"   You: "Nestle Yoghurt".      Like Arghhh   I'm sorry for the rant, I just want to know before I go insane.

He told me that according to someone he was openly gay last year, but this year he's saying he isn't because he's super religious. Now I can't get it out of my head. Ive asked other people if they know him, and mostly everyone says no. Then my other friend told me "yeah he's been gay." I was sure he probably was, then my friend Lisa told me she was sure he wasn't because she's friends with his cousin and is positive he isn't gay. He does seem like he might like me. Let me tell u he is so nice. I just don't know because he could or could not be.   He is really well groomed, but it seems like he likes me.   There's no way im just going to ask him.      Is there another way I can find out if he's gay or not?

All we have to do is borrow and spend until things improve, right? You believe this don't you? Hell, the spending will continue until we are all rich, eh? Time to start charging up everything on that charge card.       Trust the U.S. Congress to spend until we are all rich. That is what the talking heads on mainstream media tell us. Just gotta believe.

20090227165303AAglX0N	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How many atheists have ever wondered why religion developed in the first place ?	In case you're wondering, NO I do not plan on using the " there are so  many religions , that God must exist "  logic.      Instead, I think it begs the question, can humanity ever reach a stage where the majority would be truly athiest ?      I begin to wonder, is our need for a purpose so strong, that a civilization cannot exist without a majority of religion ?      I mean let us face it, even with all we know for science, people still cling into some sort of belief.      I have even heard people who claim to be atheist, but then go on to ramble about "karma" and the "spirit of the universe"       If we ever answer the " why are we so dependent on beliefs" that is when I think humanity will realize just how smart we can become.      For the moment, I think we are still surpressing much of our pysche.

Como puede un individuo tomar como absolutamente ciertas algunas premisas que son susceptibles de ser fácilmente puestas en duda.

Acaso esto no necesita día a día de un esfuerzo continuado consciente o inconsciente por convencerse a sí mismos de que dios existe.

20090227165336AAjDO0z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this making a mockery of the Catholic religion?	my neighbour has two children and they are not of any particular faith. as we live in Ireland, most state schools are run by the Catholic church and children make their communion in 2nd class at the age of 7 or 8. this family have a daughter in 2nd class so her peers will be making their Communion in the next couple of months (usually May or June). Usually in these circumstances, children from the class of other faiths are welcome to come to the Communion mass to celebrate with the other children, and so as not to feel left out, but this family is taking it to the extreme and dressing their child in full Communion attire and sending her onto the Alter with the rest of the class, even though she has never been baptised. I feel that its making a mockery of the church, and that you cant just 'pretend' to be part of a certain faith just for the sake of a day. I have no problem with the child being present at the mass, but i don't think that she should be going through the motions just for the sake of fitting in.Is the priest wrong to allow this? or is it unfair for the child to be left out of something that the rest of the class is doing?

I personally am sick of people using the word emo, calling me emo, or saying emo like a bad thing - much like how my peers use "gay" as something bad (I oppose that as well). I really do not get why people make fun of depressed people, as well, since aren't you making them MORE depressed? Your views on this subject are much appreciated.
20090227164635AAQgJKt	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do most people think marijuana is bad?	Marijuana isn't bad for you and Im not going to spend my time explaining to you kids why its not. If you argue with me about marijuana Ill tear you apart.In high school I disproved my high school teacher to the point where she just walk out of the class. Im soon to be a Marine ands I smoke and I know many other Marines in the same situation. Boot camp is over a month long and you only get about 5 hours of sleep. You have to be in good shape. All the Marines that have smoked weed did just fine in camp. I don't drink because it always leads to bad situations. The only thing I do is weed. I did my personal study. I got drunk one night and woke up feeling like **** with a lot of dead brain cells. I got really really really really high...I smoke about 100$ worth of weed. I felt good and hungry. I sleep like a angel and woke up fresh. If it was bad why wouldn't I wake up felling like s*it? I could care less if its legalized it because Im still going to smoke.      Its in the bible too.      "The Lord said unto me, 'I will take my rest and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs.' " -- Isaiah 18:4-5       And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more. -- Ezekiel 34:29

20090227165647AA6IiQ4	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why can't the world see...I am me?	It's not that I have a problem with people, it's that people have a problem with me.      I look 10 years younger than I am, I even feel comfortable talking to children. (Yes, even children think I am 10 and under). When it comes to people who look and act mature, I cannot as I am in their eyes inept to do so on their level. They see me as a kid.      I am not really shy at all, it's society keeping me from interacting with them because they look older and are biased.      I can even look directly in the eyes of my pets and speak to them in a way I would like to speak to others, in a childish tone and way of speech.      I can be mature in personality when need be but to mature people it would seem out of place because I don't "look like them".      Sometimes I get a feeling they are hating on me, these people who see me. They feel obligated to belittle me because they are jealous of the fact that I am me and they are whatever...      When they start accepting me for me, then we shall have a talk.      So is it me or them (society), who has the problem?

Se preocupan por realizar campa?as de salud, emprenden cruzadas contra el Tabaco y el alcohol, argumentando que destruyen la salude; promueven el deporte para mantenernos en forma, emprenden campa?as de vacunación. Tratan de prevenir las enfermedades para evitar gastos mayores en erradicación.      Una de las mayores lacras de la humanidad ha sido la religión: su intolerancia, fanatismo y crueldad son lugares comunes. Los creyentes sue?an con un mundo dominado por dios, su dios. Si bien ya  no se lanzan por el mundo imponiendose por la fuerza, siempre bombardean a quienes no creen en su dios.

20090227165820AA7b3Tt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If God loves everyone and forgives "sins", then why do some people say God will hate you if you're gay?	I was born Lutheran Christian. I attended church from a young age, was in the choir and hand bells, and took Catechism. My parents never forced me to do so, it was something I wanted to do. In 6th grade, I started to have feelings for girls as well as boys. All around me though, friends who were religious and adults that were religious was telling me that being gay was bad and God didn't like that. I still had my faith though, because I couldn't believe it. I never told anyone I was bisexual.       I am now in 11th grade. My faith in humanity itself has slowly deteriorated. I have come to terms with my sexuality and accepted it, as well as told a few people. However, I'm having a hard time keeping my faith in God. If God is great and He loves everyone, then how come people say that He hates people who are gay and he will condemn us to Hell?       I don't understand it. If you're hear to bash gays, please leave. I don't want to hear it. If you actually want to give insight, feel free. I just really don't know what to think anymore.

El mundo esta plagado de teorias que intentan justificar e incluso exaltar la existencia del sufrimiento, nuestro planeta lleva milenios padeciendo muerte, enfermedad, pobreza, violaciones, etc, etc, etc, y ??PARA QUE?! Muchos dicen que es para demostrarle al hombre que sin Dios no puede ser feliz, pero yo pregunto: ?Hace falta esperar tanto tiempo? Pienso que en todo caso SI existe Dios y dicen que es tan bueno no podría permitir el mal. Evidentemente, eso explicación es contradictoria. EL QUE CALLA OTORGA, DICE UN DICHO. Realmente, creo que las religiones son un instrumento de consuelo, una forma de decirte: Tené esperanza, todo va a cambiar en LA OTRA VIDA. ?Y DE QUE ME SIRVE SABER QUE HAY OTRA VIDA ( EN CASO DE QUE EXISTA) SI NO TENGO IDEA DE LA CONDICIONES EN LAS QUE SE PRESENTARA?      LO que el hombre realmente necesita es terminar con el sufrimiento ahora, entonces ? cual es la manera de lograrlo o estamos resignados a no encontrarle explicación?      Gracias, Marcos.

Like today this girl who claims to be "bi" and "scene/emo" said "ew not a girl!" when she got me as a match on the game "mash" and i'm thinking, *what the heck? i thought you said you were "bi" * A month earlier, she even called me the hottest girl in our school ! She told everyone she was bi too, just for the attention      Isn't that so annoying!      and Yes, I am bisexual, but i never tell anyone (I want to avoid seeming like a $lu+, because of todays stereotype). So I'm not bashing the real girls/guys, and if you are secure enough in yourself to be able to tell people, I give you props :)
20090227163411AAgbVmw	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Question to N. Americans, W. Europeans or Australians : What do you think of E. Europeans?	I’ve been hesitating before asking this question. It could be a sensitive question.   Actually, I have no intention to insult anyone.    I just wonder what people from developed Western countries think of those from Eastern Europe, especially the former Soviet bloc.   Their economy is mostly not very good with a notable exception of Slovenia, because they had had a communist economic system for a long time.   Some people tend to ignore others from less developed countries even in the same ethnic group, simply because their standard of living is lower.      For example, many foreign workers (guest workers) from South or South-East Asia are going to another Asian country, where the standard of living is higher than theirs and they can be more paid than in their own countries.   The guest workers are usually doing dangerous or hard work that the native-born workers do not want to do. And some of them had a high standard education in their countries. ( I’ve seen a factory worker with a master’s degree. )   Nevertheless, they are usually much less paid than the native-born workers.   And many of them are illegal immigrants and they are not normally protected by labour law.   It’s a pity that they are sometimes abused by some vicious entrepreneurs and disregarded by some heartless and ignorant native citizens.      What about the Eastern Europeans (including Russians and Ukranians)?   Are they sometimes ignored by rich Western people?

I don't like the smoke from the cigarettes but I'm attracted to guys who smoke. They have this smoky smell on them and that just makes them so manly. And some guys when they smoke, they look so sexy.

20090225103035AA2yaLA	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why is it okay for women to be sexy and show off what they have, but not men?	I find this incredibly sexist and stupid.       So unfortunately, Society has deemed it the social norm that women, and ONLY women can be sexy, half-naked, and bla bla bla bla bla bleh. It's pretty much tolerated in most areas and revered. We get it, the female body is lovely. I mean I understand because I am a female, however........................      .............Whenever a man even has the 'audacity' to take his shirt off, it's "Ew! Put your shirt back on! No one wants to see that", hetero men and alot of girls are like this. A man removes even one article of clothing and suddenly the Apocalypse is coming? Wow. Someone should really slap these people. O_o      I fail to see how the male body is grotesque and disgusting, (AND DON'T YOU DARE say hairy because not all men are hairy, I know plenty who shave their bodies and have smooth skin, my boyfriend included). Honestly, where do you get off treating the male body like it's the worst thing to happen to the human race since AIDS?       Both Genders are equally beautiful in their own way, even if your not sexually attracted to that person, doesn't mean you have to avert your eyes and have a panic attack because you just saw the same gender half naked.

20090225103249AAI7aLT	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why Brides from the EEC and as far away as Russia and Ukraine?	The latest subject of conversation around UK is should men all ages, specially men from ages of 50 to 60 get married to girls ages from 26 to 35, from Eastern European Countries, Russia and Ukraine.      It sounds more similar to mail order brides from Philippines that used to come to UK.      Is it wrong to condemn this practice, girls are escaping poverty, physical and mental abuse by males in their own countries and here they find loving, but elderly husbands, they have financial security and none of the abuse that they face in their countries.      Both parties are in a win win situation, men here find loving and young brides, girls from Eastern Europe get love, respect and financial security.      Now the question is that is this morally wrong and who is there qualified enough to judge this matter.      Please give me your serious views on this matter.

20090225103424AA6feJF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why haven't black people published an accurate account of the Holy Scriptures?	Have you heard of the Bible Experience?  A group of black personalities (the descendants of the Israelites) came together to read all the books contained in the European translation of the OT Bible, which includes four hocus-pocus books.  Now if they can do that, surely they’d find it easy to publish an ACCURATE account of the scriptures – written by Israelites for the Israelites.      An accurate account of the scriptures would omit the hocus-pocus books of Ruth, Esther, Job and Jonah which were added by foreigners to give hope to foreigners yet are contrary to true scripture - Ruth: Deuteronomy 23:3-6.  Esther: 2 Chronicles 16:7-9.  Job: Psalms 5:4.  Jonah: 1 Samuel 15:29.  An accurate account would omit words with the letter “J” since this letter doesn’t exist in the Hebrew alphabet.  An accurate account would have the true names of people and places and would omit the word Satan since neither God nor his prophets mentioned it.      If such a book were published, I’d stand in line for it.

20090225103336AAGDyoZ	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Have you ever herd this story, nice ?	Come with me to a third grade classroom..... There is a nine-year-old kid sitting at his desk and all of a sudden, there is a puddle between his feet and the front of his pants are wet. He thinks his heart is going to stop because he cannot possibly imagine how this has happened. It's never happened before, and he knows that when the boys find out he will never hear the end of it. When the girls find out, they'll never speak to him again as long as he lives.        The boy believes his heart is going to stop; he puts his head down and prays this prayer, "Dear God, this is an emergency! I need help now! Five minutes from now I'm dead meat."        He looks up from his prayer and here comes the teacher with a look in her eyes that says he has been discovered.        As the teacher is walking toward him, a classmate  named Susie is carrying a goldfish bowl that is filled with water. Susie trips in front of the teacher and inexplicably dumps the bowl of water in the boy's lap.         The boy pretends to be angry, but all the while is saying to himself, "Thank you, Lord! Thank you, Lord!"        Now all of a sudden, instead of being the object of  ridicule, the boy is the object of sympathy. The teacher rushes him downstairs and gives him gym shorts to put on while his pants dry out. All the other children are on their hands and knees cleaning up around his desk. The sympathy is wonderful. But as life would have it, the ridicule that should have been his has been transferred to someone else - Susie.        She tries to help, but they tell her to get out.    You've done enough, you klutz!"        Finally, at the end of the day, as they are waiting for the bus, the boy walks over to Susie and whispers, "You did that on purpose, didn't you?" Susie whispers back, "I wet my pants once too."    May God help us see the opportunities that are always around us to do good
20090225101755AAZJTO9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How did Christianity become so dumbed-down?	especially in the U.S.. I mean, the megachurches that go completely against anything that Jesus ever preached, the 'religious' shows where judgmental people quote Bible verses that they do not understand and condemn everyone.. the total glossing over of Christ's politically revolutionary nature.. I mean, everything. though I cannot call myself a Christian, the religion itself is much more complex than it has become.       For instance, Jesus said "The Kingdom of Heaven is within you," yet so many Christians today pretty much worship and bow down to their clergies and religious organizations, and are guilted into donating so much money to their churches as though it will somehow put them in better standing with God.

Someone share the following story with me, and I undoubtedly believe he did not making it up, but telling the truth - a real ghost story.      One day, a married couple went to a wilderness for romantic encounters. When they arrived at the wilderness, they chatted as they normally do. Meanwhile, the guy left the girl and went to his car for some water, but when he came back, the girl became partially unconscious. He was aware that she might have been possessed by a ghost. He pretended as if nothing happened and drove back to their home.       The next day, the guy brought along a high monk to his home wishing to help his wife and cast away the ghost. When the monk arrived, the possessed girl struggled and fought with the monk. Eventually, she (the ghost) requested the husband, the monk and the girl’s family members go back to the wilderness where the girl was being possessed, and they agreed.       Since the girl’s mother was a Christian and do not believe in ghost, she called police. As everybody arrived at the wilderness, the girl started to state how she was being raped and killed by man she knew. While she was talking, a chief police officer came and questioned her, during the conversation, the officer convinced that she was being processed and left. The girl’s mother whom a Christian, came to her possessed daughter, prayed and show her the cross and the bible, but doesn’t help. Ended up the high monk did cast away the ghost with Buddhism rituals.

Egli si interessa sempre dei miei problemi e sta sempre con me.   il problema è che appena provi a parlare di Dio a qualcuno subito tutti mettono le mani avanti rispondendo "non ne voglio sapere!" Dio non obbliga nessuno ad avere fede in Lui!ogniuno e libero di credere a ciò che vuole e Dio non ti obbliga a servirlo. ci sono persone che lo rifiutano e che dicono che non esiste, ma nonosante ciò Egli è continuamente accanto a loro, e pronto a rispondere alle loro preghiere se fatte veramente con il cuore. Dio ha dato il suo unico figlio, l'ha mandato sulla terra, Gesù è morto sulla croce per noi. Dio ci ama tutti indistintamente, ma i suoi figli lo amano?   non voglio aprire polemiche, vorrei sapere cosa ne pensate

Esodo Cap. 33-11 “Così YAHWEH parlava con Mosè faccia a faccia, come un uomo parla con un altro”.   Esodo Cap. 15 - 11 “Chi è come te fra gli dei, YAHWEH?"   Esodo Cap. 18 - 11 “Ora io so che YAHWEH è più grande di tutti gli altri dei, poiché egli ha operato contro gli Egiziani con quelle stesse cose di cui essi si vantavano”   Isaia Cap. 19 - 1 “Ecco, YAHWEH cavalca una nube leggera ed entra in Egitto”    Solo alcune delle molte citazioni della Bibbia (non invento nulla) in cui Dio è descritto alla pari di un dio pagano, o cmq come un essere che di spirituale ha ben poco.

20070627022407AAtYLDG	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Una volta per tutte!?	X gli ignoranti, sappiate che:   il 17 maggio del 1990 l'Assemblea generale dell Organizzazione mondiale della Sanità ha tolto l'omosessualità dalla lista delle malattie.      estratto dsm IV (manuale diagnostico e statistico delle malattie mentali)   L'omosessualità è una realtà multiforme come l'eterosessualità, in cui si differenziano COMPORTAMENTO, ORIENTAMENTO e IDENTITA' SESSUALE.   Il COMPORTAMENTO omosessuale è l'attività, l'esperienza puramente fisica.   L'ORIENTAMENTO omosessuale è rappresentato dalla comparsa nella sfera della coscienza di una preponderanza di sentimenti, pensieri erotici e fantasie che riguardano un individuo dello stesso sesso.    L'IDENTITA' consiste invece in un durevole autoriconoscimento del sentire e vivere l'omosessualità.         Quindi criticate, offendete, ma:   Cultira Scientifica 1   Ignoranti 0!!!

20090225103128AAkBL1y	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How should I break up with my girlfriend if I like this other man?	I've been dating my girlfriend for about 8 months, she is a very nice person, and I do care for her greatly... I only want the best for her, and I want her to be happy. However, we have just grown apart. We don't talk as much, and when we do it usually consists of her nagging or telling me what I am doing wrong. She used to like everything about me but now she wants me to change who I am.      I'm bisexual, and I have a close friend who is gay. We've dated before but it did not work out because we were too young and I was having a rough patch.       I've known my girlfriend and my friend for a very long time, since we were all about 14-15. (I'm 21 now). So I care very much about both of their feelings and I don't want to hurt either of them.      But lately all I can think about is my friend. He knows I like him, and I know he likes me.. Kind of. He hasn't actually said it.       I tried to tell my girlfriend I want to break up. I don't want to break up just for him, but because I feel as if she is always dragging me down.      But then she starts to cry and I feel so aweful I tell her that I didn't really mean it. She doesn't have a lot of friends or support in her life and I feel as if she depends on me.       So what do I do if I don't want to hurt her, but I really like someone else? It would hurt her even worse because he is a guy, she'll think she turned me gay or something even though she knows I'm already bisexual.

"No pretendo probar que Dios no existe... El Dios cristiano puede existir; igualmente pueden existir los dioses del Olimpo, del antiguo Egipto o de Babilonia. Pero ninguna de estas hipótesis es más probable que la otra: se encuentran fuera de la región del conocimiento comprobable y, por lo tanto, no hay razón para considerar ninguna de ellas... Dios y la inmortalidad, los dogmas centrales de la religión cristiana, no son esenciales a la religión, ya que ninguno de ellos se encuentra en el budismo.... pero en Occidente hemos llegado a considerarlos como el mínimo irreductible de la teología. Sin duda la gente continuará teniendo esas creencias, porque son agradables, como es agradable considerarnos a nosotros mismos virtuosos y considerar malvados a nuestros enemigos."

Al parecer hay varios fanáticos por ahí que esperan que la respuesta a cada pregunta en Yahoo Answers sea "porque Dios lo quiere así".

20071111141209AA9HfOj	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	El rol de las iglesias es muy importante, saben por qué ?	En el mundo hay demasiados pobres condenados a la miseria y al olvido. Personas que en su gran mayoría jamás lograrán salir adelante por cuestiones o bien educacionales o bien culturales. Lo cierto es que en el mundo es natural que hayan pobres, que hayan no tan pobres, clase media y clase rica o muy rica. Esta estructura piramidal ha existido por siempre y seguirá existiendo. El rol de las iglesias es vital, manteniendo a esta gente dentro de la cordura ante tanta diferencia clasista (ojo que no estoy en contra de dichas diferencias ya que un@ llega hasta donde su propia capacidad se lo permite). La iglesia en su discurso le otorga la fe al pobre, una fe en un mundo más allá de este en el cual, y mediante la resurección del alma y la redención espiritual, va a gozar de una eternidad con el creador. Ese es el papel fundamental de la iglesia, aplacar los apetitios materiales en aquellos que jamás llegarán a tener nada. Sin la iglesia, revolución total y sálvennos quien pueda!! Opinan ??

20071228091923AAswnwz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Esta Reflexion es especial para mis amigos  y todo aquel que quiera leerla.?	Las Personas son regalos     Las personas son regalos que la vida me ha dado. Ya vienen envueltas, algunas en forma muy bella y otras de una manera menos atractiva.      Algunos han sido maltratados en el correo; otros llegan como “Entrega Especial”; algunos llegan envueltos, otros cerrados con gran rigidez. Pero la envoltura no es el regalo y es importante darse cuenta de esto. Es muy fácil equivocarse en este sentido, juzgando el contenido por el estuche.      A veces el regalo se abre con facilidad; otras se necesita la ayuda de otras personas. Tal vez es porque tiene miedo, quizá han sido heridas antes y no quieren ser lastimadas de nuevo. Pudo ser que alguna vez se abrieron y luego se descartaron. Quizá ahora se sienten más bien como “cosas” que como seres humanos.      Yo soy una persona. Como todas las demás personas también soy un regalo. Poseo una bondad que es sólo mía. Y sin embargo, algunas veces tengo miedo de mirar dentro de mi envoltura. Tal vez temo decepcionarme, quizá no confío en el que llevo dentro. Pudiera ser que en realidad nunca he aceptado el regalo que soy.      Cada encuentro y comunicación entre personas es un intercambio de regalos. Mi regalo soy yo, tú eres tu regalo. Somos obsequios de Dios unos para otros.      Es difícil pensar en ocasiones que aquel que me ha lastimado es también un regalo de Dios, pero si vemos la ofensa como una envoltura maltratada y no nos quedamos con ella, seguramente encontraremos un hermoso regalo, pues de cada suceso Dios nos tiene una ense?anza para crecer en su amor, en nuestra fe.      Nosotros mismos podemos tener una envoltura tan maltratada por el tiempo y/o las circunstancias, pero lo que llevamos dentro siempre será hermoso, pues quien lo puso ahí es nuestro Creador, solo tendríamos que ver hacia adentro y estar listos para darnos… descubre en tu interior todos los dones con los que el Se?or te conformó y sé el digno regalo para los que te necesitamos.

20071222173950AAngH8h	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Pregunta para los que sepan del origen de los apellidos europeos en Argentina?	Resulta que mi apellido es Gaitán.      Yo busqué su origen en un buscador de apellidos y decía que era espa?ol.      Pero, la familia de mi papá dice que el abuelo de mi papá, que es el que lleva ese apellido, era italiano.      También encontré que Gaitan con "i" latina es un derivado de Gaetano (apellido italiano) Y el que es espa?ol es Gaytán.      La pregunta es:   Suponiendo que mi bisabuelo fuera de apellido Gaetano -ya que Gaitán es un apellido espa?ol- Es posible que se lo hayan modificado cuando emigró a Argentina???

Ma perche la gente è cosi superficiale?Perche si giudica basandosi solo sulle apparenze?      Aggiungo anche che sono cresciuto in un ambiente familiare dove sudetta parola veniva sempre usata da mio padre e forse per questo ogni tanto mi salta fuori      Eppoi le vere discriminazioni non si fanno a parole ma nei fatti....chi si attacca a questi dettagli è il primo ad essere razzista

Los criticos del creacionismo afirman que la ciencia jamas  podra demostrar el relato de la creacion registrado en el libro del Genesis . Es cierto . Sin embargo , lo mismo se aplica a la teoria Darwiniana atea de la evolucion.      Muchos parecen olvidar que la evolucion es solo una teoria, no es un hecho cientifico.      Se la trata en libros de texto, revistas cientificas, salones de clase y documentales de T.V. como si fuera un hecho, por lo que se considera creible.      Pero lo cierto es que esta llena de errores teoricos, logicos y cientificos.      Aceptarla requiere igual o mayor fe que aceptar el relato de la creacion ?  y nos llaman a los cristianos religiosos!!!!!
